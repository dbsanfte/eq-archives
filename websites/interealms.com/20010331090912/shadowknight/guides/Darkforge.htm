<h3>
What are the quests</h3>
The quests start in the Temple of Sol Ro in Lavastorm - although there
is no requirement to visit there prior
<br>to handing items in to get the armour. There are two undead knights
in the temple hail either one to start the
<br>quests, be careful that you're handing your hard won items to the correct
knight as they make the different
<br>things. When ever handing items in ensure they are unstacked. It is
possible for 2 people to complete one
<br>quest - simply have your friend hand his piece of decayed in first
and then ensure you complete the quest
<br>immediately afterwards.
<p>Head to Cazic Thule (CT), the dungeon in Feerott, and kill Crusaders
(Level 31-33 Shadowknight Lizards) that drop pieces of Decayed Armour.
Each piece of Darkforge is made from a pair of pieces of decayed and another
component.&nbsp; As Shadowknights, remember that the Crusaders will harm
touch, fear, and darkness you.
<p>Darkforge Gauntlets:&nbsp;&nbsp; left and right gauntlets + 1 bar of
enchanted platinum.
<br>Darkforge Bp:&nbsp; Decayed Mail and Breastplate + 2 bars of enchanted
platinum
<br>Darkforge Greaves:&nbsp; Left and Right Legplate (<i>these look like
arms</i>) + 2 piece of Melatite
<br>Darkforge Boots:&nbsp; Left and Right Boot + 2 fairy dusts
<br>Darkforge Bracer:&nbsp; Left and Right Bracer + 1 broken mino horn.
<br>Darkforge Helm: Decayed Visor and Helm + 2 broken freeport militia
helms.
<br>Darkforge Vambraces:&nbsp; Left and Right Vambracers + 1 Qeynos Kite
Shield
<p>Please note that turning in the Left and Right Decayed Bracer, along
with the horn will only yield <b>one</b> Darkforge bracer, so you will
have to complete the quest twice to complete your set.
<h3>
What are the Additional Components</h3>
<b>Qeynos Kite Shields:</b> (Vambraces) There are 2 easy guards at the
first guard tower in North Karana, following the way from South Karana
Stone Bridge. 2 kills, 2 shields or by giving a low level 10pp to go inside
the city and buy one off a vendor for you (sell for 5-8pp last time I checked).
The shield you require is indeed a Qeynos Kite Shield (not a wooden kite
shield, or any other form). It has the flag of Qeynos as it's graphic.
<p><b>Damaged Militia Helms:</b> (Helm) Easiest to get from the patrolling
guard (Ledshin) behind the arena in West Freeport.&nbsp; This item is nodrop.
<p><b>Faery Dust:</b> Lesser F. Faery town. The easy maidmen drop the dust,
too, you don't have to kill the guards
<br>(drop). -When getting Faerie Dust, it is best to hang around near Felwithe
in Gfay and kill pixies and other
<br>small game until you see a Faerie spawn. They are usually a Faerie
Royal Guard, Maiden, Princess, etc.
<br>Dust drops usually on 1 out of every 3 or 4 of them, so it shouldn't
be too difficult. Remember, Faerie Dust is
<br>white, Pixie Dust is yellow, be wary if people try to sell it to you.
I would also suggest resisting the urge to
<br>go to Lesser Faydark and camp the Pixie building. True, Faeries have
a better potential to spawn here, but
<br>you risk running into a wandering Brownie, NPC druids who are TOUGH
for their level (30-45). Your best bet is to be patient in Greater Fay.&nbsp;
<p><b>Broken Minotaur Lord Horn</b> (Bracer) is always dropped off of the
Mino Lords in Steamfont. They are reasonably difficult, but if you are
a good soloer you can take them alone at 33+, otherwise get another person
around your level to help and they should be no trouble. One thing to watch
for is that deep in the Mino caves (if you follow the left path) Mino Lords
spawn and wander, dangerously close to lvl 35 gnome necro, Meldrath.&nbsp;
Anyone who has ever fought NPC necros around their level before knows that
unnecessarily engaging one is generally not the best idea. Remember that
the Minotaur Hero is different from the Lord and a much higher level mob
(mid to high 40s i believe).
<p><b>Melatite</b> (Greaves) is found on the clockworks in Sol A. People
often are selling melatite in the zone for 50pp per brick or so, but if
you want to camp them it drops fairly often (1 out of 2 or 3 has it).
<p><b>Enchanted Platinum Bars</b>:&nbsp; Buy a normal platinum bar and
have an enchanter enchant it
<h3>
Where do I Hunt Crusaders?</h3>
Get a good map - from somewhere like <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com">www.eqmaps.com</a>
or <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">www.eqatlas.com</a>
<p>Hunting Crusaders in Cazic becomes significantly easier at 30 with Gather
Shadows and Feign Death allowing you quick access to other areas if necessary.
If you're below 30 - join a Throne Room group. You'll get a chance at a
Lizzie Cloak as well if you're lucky and it's closer to the zone.&nbsp;
<p>The best place to hunt Crusaders is probably 4-corners or the ziggurat
(pyramid temple).&nbsp;
<p>Crusaders are known to have Zealots as placeholders.
<p>When you zone into CT you enter the courtyard (cy).&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
To your right is an entrance to the maze - which leads to 4-corners and
the Ziggurat (stepped-temple).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Straight ahead of you, up the ladder and then down the righthand side well
is the way to the planks/sewers and then AoF.</li>

<li>
Straight ahead of you and through the door on the far wall in the left
hand side is the way to the Silver Guards/Temple.</li>

<li>
To your left at the far end of the wall is the door to either - turn right
at the t-junction - Throne Room or turn left at the T-Junction - AoF.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
As soon as you join the group, ALWAYS tell them that you are looking for
Crusaders so you can loot pieces of decayed for quest armor. Remind them
that it is No Drop. It is also often best to remind them nearing the end
of a battle with a Crusader, in case someone decides to loot the corpse
and grabs some decayed because "it looked like banded". Never discount
a well written shout every 15/30 mins or so - few ppl like the whole twink
thing - and other SK's esp. would rather let an SK loot than some other
class. I certainly send /tells to fellow SK's if I find decayed I've already
got. It also helps in my experience if you list which pieces you need.
<h3>
But didn't they used to.....</h3>
<b>Mistmoore/Najena:&nbsp; </b>Previously the 2 quest giving Undead Knights
lived in Mistmoore and Najena - they have since been moved to the Temple
of Sol Ro.
<p><b>Minotaur Hero:&nbsp; </b>Previously the Additional Component for
a Darkforge Bracer was a Minotaur hero shackle also used in the Hero Bracer
quest.&nbsp; It was changed due to heavy competion from Hero Bracer farmers.
<p><b>Gorillas:&nbsp; </b>For one historic week the Gorillas in Cazic Thule
dropped Decayed - they haven't done since.
<p><b>AC/Weight:&nbsp; </b>The stats for Darkforge have been changed, the
AC increased and the weight decreased.
<p><b>Decayed Drops Rates:&nbsp; </b>Previously Crusaders drop one or none
decayed. They now seem to drop one or two pieces.&nbsp; Crusaders have
also been made much more common
<p><b>Nodrop:</b>&nbsp; The armor was originally nodrop, but this was changed
when the AC was increased.&nbsp; The decayed pieces remain nodrop.
