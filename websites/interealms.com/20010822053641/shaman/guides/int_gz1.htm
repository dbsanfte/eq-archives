      Geoffrey Zatkin, designer of the EverQuest spell system donates some time
      to answer a few questions.
      <p><br>
      <i><b>MUNG: I'm curious about your vision for the Shaman class. Briefly,
      how did Verant design the Shaman to fit into the world of Everquest?</b></i><br>
      GZ: When we designed our magic classes, we decided on 3 &quot;Priest&quot;
      types and 4 &quot;Magi&quot; types. I wasn't even on the EQ team at that
      point - only Brad and a few others were. I came on over 2 years ago, and
      one of my responsibilities became the magic system.<br>
      We knew that Shamans were going to be the big races - the ones that were
      primitive - less sophisticated in their worship. Shaman spells are much
      more spirit/animal oriented than those of other classes.<br>
      As for the rest - I knew that I wanted a good 'buffing' class in EQ, one
      that would buff in ways not seen in AD&amp;D. A lot of the Shaman ideas
      came from hours of me sitting in a coffee shop brainstorming after a full
      day of work - that and a good bit of feedback from team members.<br>
      But to get back to topic, Shamans were designed to be the Clerics for the
      more primitive races. You will notice no race has both Shamans AND
      Clerics. Shaman magic is more primal, more concerned with individuals and
      making them stronger or weaker than that of any other Priest class.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: As a player, what's your favorite thing about the Shaman
      class?</b></i><br>
      GZ: That is a hard one. I like that a Shaman with a lot of mana and a
      friendly disposition can really make any character into a superman. The
      variety of buffs that a Shaman has is fun. I also like the Shaman's
      &quot;mess with you&quot; ability - not as good as an Enchanter, but still
      considerable. Shamans are good people persons - both for and against you.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: So... I have to ask, what's your least favorite thing?</b></i><br>
      GZ: The intelligence. The races that play Shamans just aren't that bright.
      Having played a lot of Magi types, going to a 65 or 70 INT hurts..<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Is Spirit of Wolf too good of a spell as some people claim, or
      is this just spell-envy?</b></i><br>
      GZ: SoW is a great spell. Everybody wants it, because walking sucks when
      you are used to SoW.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Are there plans to alter Spirit of Wolf?</b></i><br>
      GZ: Every once in a while I get the mad urge to make it so that if you
      cast a spell, SoW goes away. But then we would have to remove the
      slow-down component from the Necromancer Clinging Darkness series &amp;
      gimp the Bard Song Selo's Accelerando. And while we were at it we'd have
      to fix the Root spell, since Root bombing is very similar to kiting.<br>
      Basically, anything that lets you more faster than your opponent is
      trouble. So, as it stands right now, no plans to change SoW.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: If your life depended on it, who would you pick in a
      one-on-one fight, a Shaman or a Druid? Why?</b></i><br>
      GZ: Depends on the level of the caster, and what class I was. If I were a
      melee type, the Shaman. If I were a caster, the Druid. Why? Damage Shields
      bite if you are a melee type. Actually, Shamans get that slow down melee
      spell, so...<br>
      Hmmm. I don't know. And you can quote me on that.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Okay, here are some specific requests I've seen repeatedly...
      I'm sure you've seen them many times too.<br>
      Summon Bandages seems like a logical spell for the Shaman. We're healers
      and &quot;medicine men&quot; (sorry for the gender reference). Any reason
      why it isn't a Shaman spell?</b></i><br>
      GZ: The only class that gets to summon items (besides food &amp; water) is
      the Magician. Clerics get to summon a weapon, but Magician weapons are
      better, as are their summoned magic trinkets. This is just a Magician
      specialty that no other class gets.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Locate Corpse seems like a natural fit for a Shaman. We talk
      to spirits, we see visions...</b></i><br>
      GZ: The problem is that there are a lot of cool spells out there. I tried
      to make sure that a lot of the really cool stuff only went to 1-2 classes
      - this keeps all the classes unique. For example, SoW is only Shamans and
      Druids. Group Teleport is Wizards and Druids. Charm is now only Enchanters
      (with exceptions for Animals and Undead). Items are Magicians only. Pacify
      is Cleric and Enchanter only, Attack Speed is Enchanter and Shaman only,
      etc. Locate Corpse is Necromancer (and SK) and Bard only.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: In a world where disconnects, crashes and server drops are
      frequent (not to mention frustrated significant others who yank the power
      cord), would you consider designing spirit pouch to disappear after a
      lengthy time delay... say 30 minutes?</b></i><br>
      GZ: This was designed to be a risky spell. In a perfect world with better
      internet connections, more reliable servers (though I have to say, our Sys
      admin is wonderful - usually we have trouble with hardware or ... well,
      lets just say our staff is great) and happy S.O.s, I would probably have
      had to put in a small chance of losing an item in the pouch, or some such.
      As it is, I just rely on current technology.<br>
      Spirit Pouch is a wonderful spell. It does have drawbacks, but is still a
      wonderful spell.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: The Shaman, possibly more than anyone, runs out of spell slots
      really fast! We have such a variety of tools. Is the lack of additional
      spell slots just a technical limitation, or are there gameplay reasons why
      we're limited to so few slots?</b></i><br>
      GZ: Enchanters get me on this one too. As of release, there are technical
      reasons for not adding more slots. At the end of Beta, the tuning team
      took a vote, and decided not to up the number of spells that could be
      memorized. It was felt that this would make people chose more carefully -
      it also results in different people in the same class behaving
      differently, depending on what they have memorized. Just because you have
      two Shamans in your party does not mean that they will both be doing the
      same thing.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Are there plans to add a few more piercing weapons for the
      Shaman? Currently, only the Main-Gauche seems to work. Doesn't this make
      piercing somewhat pointless?</b></i><br>
      GZ: We mostly put in piercing so Shamans could use spears. I don't
      remember who it was, but somebody was very hot on Shamans using spears.
      And yes, there are plans for more piercing weapons.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Is it just an oversight that the Shaman class can use some
      axes, but not train in one-hand slashing?</b></i><br>
      GZ: Sounds like it, yes.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Oh, yeah... will there ever be a way to reorganize one's
      spellbook?</b></i><br>
      GZ: Possibly. I really want to say yes, but the programmer involved told
      me how many days of his time it would take. The chances of me getting DAYS
      out of somebody's schedule for reorganizing spell books is small. I'd love
      to have it though.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Are there plans to add a new Direct Damage spell for the 40's?</b></i><br>
      GZ: Not really. Shamans do have Blizzard Blast which does a solid hit of
      damage. They also have Plague and Envenomed Bolt, both of which do
      horrific amounts of damage over time.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: I hear barbarian males complaining all the time about... No!
      not THAT! They're complaining about not seeing their shields in 3rd person
      view.</b></i><br>
      GZ: I honestly don't know on that one. That would be the art team. Sorry -
      though I wish I knew everything.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Doh! Silly me...</b></i><br>
      Here's a portion of the interview that appeared a couple of weeks ago...<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Recently, the Damage over Time spells were &quot;tuned&quot;.
      This implies that further tuning is possible. Is that the case?</b></i><br>
      GZ: Possible - but the tuning was good for everybody EXCEPT for people
      that kited a lot. Good for party play, good for solo fighting play, bad
      for solo kiting play.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Obviously without giving away too many statistics, in what way
      were the DoT spells tuned?</b></i><br>
      GZ: DoT spells were tuned to do more damage in shorter periods of time.
      This means that a poison spell that used to take 60 seconds to do its full
      damage might only take 30 seconds now. Same damage done, just in 1/2 the
      time. It is hard to see how people can get upset about this.<br>
      The only MAJOR ones were Plague and Scourge - they used to take about 6
      min to do their damage - now they take about 2. They do less damage now -
      but...<br>
      In a group fight, a creature does not usually stay alive 6 min. Therefore,
      making it do a lot more damage over a shorter period of time helps out a
      lot.<br>
      In a stand up, one on one (or 2 on 1) fight, you usually don't want to
      wait 6 min for the damage to be done - so this is a big help, again.
      Damage done more quickly means that the creature dies faster, and that you
      take less damage during a fight.<br>
      In a kiting fight, you don't care about time. Well, I hate to say it, but
      kiting is chimpy. We never really wanted kiting, but it is part of the
      game. If I have a chance to balance a spell to help parties and to help
      people in a stand up fight, but that makes it harder to kite... Well, I
      didn't even hesitate.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: What kind of shift does the change in Druids reflect in
      Verant's view of the Shaman role versus the Druid role?</b></i><br>
      GZ: Druids and Shamans are both good classes. Druids do better DD. Shamans
      get better buffs. Both have GREAT DoT. Both heal well, and get
      regeneration. Druids get charm, Shamans get pets. Druids can cast a Damage
      Shield, Shamans can Decrease a creature's attack speed. Both have some
      unique abilities, such as Cannibalize, Group Teleport, etc. Both the
      Shaman and the Druid are valued members of the party.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Was the change in Root to address the way Spirit of Wolf and
      Spirit of Cheetah could anull a Root?</b></i><br>
      GZ: Yep. And could get rid of Treeform, Minor Illusion, etc. Both classes
      get Cancel Magic - they can still get rid of Root.<br>
      Here we resume the newest portion of the interview...<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Okay, okay, the last of the tough questions... What's still
      missing for the Shaman class in your opinion? Is there something else
      you're covertly planning? C'mon, I'm sure you guys are up to something
      nifty... spill it! So maybe throw us a bone (chip)....</b></i><br>
      GZ: Shamans are pretty well done, in my opinion. I am still planning to
      add and tinker a bit, but most of what I want done for Shamans is already
      done. From a magic standpoint, at least.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Alright, now time to take that mask off... What class/race are
      you currently having the most fun playing?</b></i><br>
      GZ: I have got to say that I love my 1/2 elf Bard - but mostly because
      when I play, I am a very social player. Bards are good at being social. In
      fact, I built them to be so. This is my current one - I have played a lot
      of EQ, and tend to change my opinion every few weeks.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Think outside the box... if you could instantly change one
      thing about EverQuest or it's players, what would that be?</b></i><br>
      GZ: What would I change about EQ - I would love to have had another 10
      people on the Dev (development) team, just for game content. We could have
      worked another 10 years on this game and still not have had as much
      content as I want (more quests, more items, more dungeons, etc.) Content
      is tricky, because no matter how much you have, more is always better.<br>
      What would I change about our players - I would love for them to realize
      that we (the entire dev team) does what we think is best for the game.
      People seem to think that we hate particular classes, or races, or cities,
      etc. They think that we gimped their class just &quot;because,&quot; or
      that we lowered/raised something on whim. Everything we do we do for long
      term player enjoyment, as well as keeping game balance.<br>
      I submit to you that what players think they want and what they [really
      want] are two different things. Players want, for example, to be powerful
      from the start. They want to log on and slay things (maybe not Dragons,
      but big things). They want to find the Gleaming Sword of Gerard quickly,
      and fight their way to fame and glory by level 10. They want their
      character to be more powerful than everybody else's, because it is
      &quot;them&quot; playing it.<br>
      Ok, I may be overstating this a bit, but not by much.<br>
      People don't really want this. Things you get too easily are not valued as
      much as things that you worked for. Games that are too easy people play
      for a while, and then quit. People have been playing EQ many hours a day
      for 4 months and have no sign of stopping. What was the last game you
      played for this long, this many hours a day? I think one of the reasons
      that people continue to play it is that it is NOT easy. There is always
      more to get - always a chance to become greater, grander and more
      glorious.<br>
      Yes, I do have a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. I am allowed to say
      things like this.<br>
      So anyway, I'd want our players to trust us a little, to think that we are
      at least trying to do things that we think are better for game play.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: What's been the most motivating thing for you in your job at
      Verant?</b></i><br>
      GZ: I get paid to be creative, to think stuff up, and to implement it. How
      cool is that? For me, at least, this is a dream job.<br>
      Some of my friends think I'm crazy - this kind of job would drive them
      nuts. When I tell them that I spent 9 hours writing math algorithms for
      the difference between DD, DoT and AoE spells, they back off a step. When
      I tell them that I spent a year working on a mythical ideal called
      &quot;game balance&quot; for 7 different types of spell casting classes,
      they run. Heaven forbid I start talking about the wonders of database
      organization, or abstract spell theory.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: What kinds of things make you want to stay in bed, and not go
      to work?</b></i><br>
      GZ: The usual. Anything you do long enough becomes a job. Any task you do
      long enough becomes work.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Wow, we packed a lot of questions in there. You have any last
      comments for the Shaman players out there?</b></i><br>
      GZ: Be excellent to one another. Duck when you enter Dwarven doorways.
      Remember that lots is good, and more-than-enough is even better. Mana is
      good, pre-combat buffs are superb. When in doubt, cast both spells.
      Cannibilize is only as good as your front line of warriors - but better
      they should have the HP than you.<br>
      <i><b>MUNG: Thanks for your time GZ, we all know you've got plenty of
      stuff on your plate!</b></i><br>
