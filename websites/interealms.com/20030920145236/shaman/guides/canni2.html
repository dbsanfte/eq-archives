                Quest for McMerin’s Feast, aka Cannibalize 2</font></b> 
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  This is the quest for the level 39 shaman spell, <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=754&source=Live">Cannibalize 
                  2</a>. Do not be confused by the name, as only the physical 
                  scroll for the spell is named “McMerin’s Feast”. Once scribed 
                  in your spellbook, it is called Cannibalize 2. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  This spell is only available through this quest. However, the 
                  quest is extremely difficult to accomplish at level 39. At least 
                  one of the parts is a challenge even for a group of level 50s. 
                  You may wish to buy some of the parts and to solicit help from 
                  stronger friends. There are shamans who will tell you that you 
                  are better off just toughing it out with Cannibalize 1 until 
                  you reach level 54 and can use Cannibalize 3. That’s an awfully 
                  long time to wait given how important cannibalizing is to shamans. 
                  But the fact that such advice is even given should indicate 
                  how much effort this will take you at 39 or even well into your 
                  40s. If you find that you cannot do it until you are in your 
                  low 50s, it is almost certainly well worth it unless you level 
                  <i>very</i> quickly. </font></p>
                <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Barbarians, 
                  vah shir, and guktan (frogloks</b><strong>)</strong> start in 
                  Firiona Vie by speaking with Marlyn McMerin in the shaman guild 
                  on the dock, at approximately -3800, 1700. If you hail her she 
                  will explain her dilemma. Tell her that you will search for 
                  rare alchemy components. </font></p>
                <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Trolls, 
                  ogres, and iksar</b> should start the quest by speaking with 
                  The Great Oowomp at the ogre camp in Timorous Deep. He is on 
                  the same island where the boats come to and from Oasis and Overthere. 
                  Ask him about the McMerin clan. He will profess to a bit of 
                  thievery and offer to give the spell to you in exchange for 
                  collecting the same things that Marlyn requests. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  Note: Iksar should be careful, as other ogres nearby may agro. 
                  If that happens the Oowomp will agro as well. You may wish to 
                  bring along some help to back you up. Then, if you get agro, 
                  be sure to kill the Oowomp first and stall for a minute or two 
                  before killing the others. The Oowomp’s respawn time is a little 
                  over 5 minutes, so you can then turn in your items and scoot 
                  out of there before the others return. The Great Oowomp is level 
                  34; the other ogres should be the same or lower. Just be sure 
                  your helpers know that you will take hits to The Overthere faction 
                  for killing these ogres. </font></p>

                    the big, brown golems. It is droppable but lore. That means 
                    you may be able to nab this in the Bazaar or even from other 
                    people hunting in City of Mist. If you hunt for it, the behemoths 
                    spawn throughout various parts of the City of Mist, including 
                    the area before and after the entrance bridge. Be careful 
                    searching for them, as you can sneak past the ghosts with 
                    invisibility to undead but will be spotted by the behemoths. 
                    The behemoths themselves are approximately level 40-45. <br>

                    in Trakanon’s Teeth. They are most commonly sighted around 
                    the aquaducts outside the exterior wall of the Sebilis ruins 
                    as well as in the area outside the ruins that house Emperor 
                    Ganak in the southwest of the zone. You will save a great 
                    deal of time if you bring a tracker along to help find them. 
                    When you do find one, either pull it to the zone wall to fight 
                    or be prepared for adds, as there are a lot of hungry critters 
                    wandering around out there. Do not be confused by the shaman 
                    powder that drops off of other varieties of froglok shamans 
                    and is white and no drop, or the shaman powder off of nok 
                    shamans that is black and no drop. The one you need is black 
                    and droppable. Here again, you may have success in the Bazaar 
                    or in asking other people in the zone. The yun shamans are 
                    also approximately level 40-45. <br>

                    They drop off of the Skeletal Warlord in Karnor’s Castle. 
                    Alas, your chances of getting a group here at level 39 are 
                    slim to none. The warlord can spawn in place of most of the 
                    ghosts and skeletons throughout the zone. With the frequency 
                    of trains in Karnor’s, more than one shaman has obtained the 
                    bones by hanging out at the zone and waiting for someone to 
                    train the warlord there. The bones are no drop, so you cannot 
                    buy them. But as the quest is their only use, you may wish 
                    to /ooc periodically to advertise that you need them. If you 
                    find someone else who has a spare, they are multiquestable, 
                    as long as the other person has sufficient faction with your

                        Timorous Deep. This island is the iceberg home of the 
                        golras. They do not see invis. It is very easy to spot, 
                        a little brown bag sitting on the ice. From anywhere in 
                        the zone you can just fire up levitate and invis and run 
                        to that loc. If you are unfamiliar with the area, be careful 
                        in the middle of the zone where there are sunken pirate 
                        ships containing undead pirates, as well as a big patch 
                        of space through which you cannot pass. (That is where 
                        the boats zone to and from Firiona and Overthere.) The 
                        closest island to the golra iceberg is the elven outpost. 
                        From there you would run due south (again, levitated and 
                        invis) and will see the bag sitting on the northeast side 
                        of the iceberg island. The Crushed Diamonds will respawn 
                        8-12 hours after being taken. If you get to that loc and 
                        do not see them anywhere, they have probably <br>

                        Way:</i> Buy a dufrenite from any of several locations, 
                        including the vendors in most home cities that sell the 
                        vendor potions and crystals. Bring an enchanter, necro, 
                        or bard to the huge spires in Dreadlands, near the functional 
                        wizzie spires. On the ground under those spires there 
                        are some pyramids containing various nasty creatures. 
                        One of them is the Gem Cutter Skeleton. He may wander 
                        in and out of one of the pyramids. He will be kos, so 
                        charm him and give him the dufrenite to receive your Dread 
                        Diamond. Then head to Kaesora or Trakanon’s Teeth and 
                        start killing spectral guardians until you get a Spectral 
                        Pestle. Combine it with the Dread Diamond in a Medicine 
                        Bag to get your Crushed Dread Diamond. The combine is 
                        trivial at an alchemy skill of 70. If you fail you will 
                        get the Dread Diamond back but not the Pestle. I told
