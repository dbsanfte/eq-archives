                  Quest for Blood of Nadox</font></strong></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                  is the quest for the level 52 shaman spell <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3842&source=Live">Blood 
                  of Nadox</a>. The spell is a cure for both poison and disease. 
                  Completing this quest at level 44 will definitely require either 
                  some high level help or a very, very strong group. However, 
                  the exp is good into the high 50s and even low 60s, and there 
                  can be other nice drops, so you have tools to entice some help. 
                  You must have the Legacy of Ykesha expansion in order to complete 
                  this quest.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  quest is given by Grennik Neltrin at +1600 -60 in the Gulf of 
                  Gunthak. She sends you off to gather <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=59044">Gunthak 
                  Gulf Water</a>, <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=59045">A 
                  blackened vial</a>, <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=59043">Broken 
                  Skull clan blood</a>, and <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=59049">Pure 
                  Blood</a>. You combine the first three items together in a brew 
                  barrel, and then combine the result of that with the Pure Blood 
                  to make <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=59053">A 
                  glowing black potion</a>. Neither of the two combines will fail. 
                  Hail Grennik, follow her conversation until it ends, and then 
                  give her the glowing black potion. She will hand back your Spell: 
                  Blood of Nadox.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 
                  four of the drops are Magic and No Drop, but are not Lore. Due 
                  to the quest design, none of it can be multiquested.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More 
                  Drop Details:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Gunthak 
                  Gulf Water</b>: Drops off of any of the pirates in the harbor 
                  or the fort in the Gulf of Gunthak. (Iksar can also forage it.) 
                  It is a rather uncommon drop and may require several hours of 
                  camping. To get to the harbor camp from the Gulf of Gunthak 
                  lighthouse, put up sow, invis, and levitate and run due south 
                  to the beach. Once at the beach, hug the right wall and run 
                  back to the tunnel. From there, follow the right wall until 
                  you reach the harbor. To try the fort, follow the left wall 
                  instead of the right at the tunnel from the beach. Any of the 
                  pirates at either camp could drop the water. The levels vary 
                  somewhat but should be mostly soloable, if tough, at 44. They 
                  do run when at low health, so if you are unable to snare be 
                  sure to choose a pull spot where you have some room to manuever. 
                  You will have a better chance of getting single pulls if you 
                  use nondamaging spells to pull (slow is recommended) and pull 
                  those that are closest to you first, so that they do not run 
                  directly past other mobs.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A 
                  blackened vial</b>: Drops off of Broken Skull adherents or initiates 
                  in the Crypt of Nadox, as well as the few named that share camps 
                  with adherents and initiates. To get to Nadox from Gunthak, 
                  cross the open area south of the harbor and follow the passage 
                  further south to the castle. Enter the castle and run all the 
                  way straight back into the furthest room. From there, follow 
                  the passage in the wall on the right (west) to zone into Nadox. 
                  The adherents are much tougher than the pirates and can be difficult 
                  to solo even well into your 50s. Resists are problematic even 
                  at 61, so resist debuffing will be very helpful. The adherents 
                  are shamans, so you will also want to have your own resists 
                  up. They also gate and have sow in spite of being in an indoor 
                  zone, so when they run at low health (and resist roots) it can 
                  be very problematic indeed. Snare would be a big help here. 
                  If you are attempting these at level 44, some high level help 
                  would definitely be useful. Otherwise, bring a group and start 
                  killing at the zone to get a feel for how well you can handle 
                  things. The adherents are scattered throughout much of the zone, 
                  particularly the areas around the zone from Gunthak, so you 
                  will not be wasting your time. One camp further in that you 
                  may also wish to try, as described by Islowem on <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=4c220b532cae7661ce536ea85396d7a4&threadid=11716"> 
                  the message boards</a>: "From zone in ... go left. Go up the 
                  slope, and past the first room off to the left. Stop at the 
                  hall to the right. I set up camp here. There are two guard roamers, 
                  and one sycophant ... roamer. Kill those three. Then looking 
                  on down the hall, you see three mobs. Two guarding a door, and 
                  one roaming back and forth. The two guarding the door can drop 
                  the vial. Either can spawn as a named also...."</font></p>

                  in Nadox. These may be a little lower level than the adherents 
                  but still hit very hard. They are also scattered throughout 
                  portions of the zone, including one at the camp described for 
                  the adherents. From the adherent camp, you can also reach another 
                  spot with more blackhands as follows, again described by Islowem: 
                  "Invis back up, and go down to the room where you [were] pulling 
                  the two door guards. Go thru that room. Just past the next hall 
                  to the right, and before the next room, [stop] and set up camp 
                  again. Two roamers at most (both sycophants), and the room directly 
                  ahead is full of furious and vehement."</font></p>

                  Blood</b>: Drops off of luggalds in Nadox. It definitely can 
                  come from luggald initiates and abominations but might also 
                  come from other luggalds as well. These are every bit as difficult 
                  as the adherents but harder to reach. Higher level help is strongly 
                  recommended. Some luggalds, but not all, are undead, so neither 
                  form of invisibility will keep you entirely safe. A suggested 
                  camp spot for them, again from Islowem: "From the last camp 
                  spot ... continue thru that room, you will enter a cavern. To 
                  the left is a bridge. Go across the bridge. You will see three 
                  halls. ... I set up camp by going thru the middle door, straight 
                  thru the room full of luggald, and setting up camp in the middle 
                  of the next hall. No roamers here, so was a good spot."</font></p>
