      Many of you may think you have a good idea of what a Troll shaman is all
      about, but I'll bet few of you realize that the Troll shaman is, bar none,
      the most evil, insidious creature in the game. I'm not making that up.
      Verant themselves state this. When you create your shaman, be sure to read
      the paragraph that Verant wrote to help us with roleplaying. In our lovely
      hometown of Grobb we are known only as &quot;The Dark Ones.&quot; We are
      more feared here than any warrior or shadowknight, for we and we alone
      possess the true power of Innoruuk. We are also know for our fascination
      with torture. True, all trolls enjoy a good torturing now and then, but
      nobody on the face of Norrath enjoys it like a Troll shaman. Poison and
      disease are our absolute favorite things. We love to feel poison coursing
      through our veins and disease wracking our bodies allmost as much as we
      enjoy inflicting that same pain on other creatures. Malady and deadly
      poisons are the true tools of power that Innoruuk has granted us. Most
      Troll shaman worship Innoruuk, and those who do not are regarded as
      primative and unfocused. It is our intense loyalty to the lord of hatred,
      and our twisted ways of serving his will, that make us the most vile
      biengs on the face of Norrath. Even the dark elves fall short of us in the
      evil department, sorry inkies, but this is one area we have locked down.
      ;) You may think that the Troll shaman is &quot;smarter than your average
      troll.&quot; Well, you're wrong. We are just as simple minded as our
      warrior and shadowknight brethren, but we are simple with a delightfully
      evil twist. It's that simple fact that makes this class so fun to roleplay.<br>
      <br>
      <b>VIEWS ON OTHER RACES</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Ogres:</b> As shaman, we cant help but respect ogres, not only for
      thier size and brute strength, but for the fact that they are usually our
      brothers in battle. Ogres are allways welcome amongst the Troll shaman,
      allthough ogre shaman are usually viewed as inferiors, because of their
      allmost exclusive servitude of the god of war, Rallos Zek.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dark Elves:</b> Shaman most definately have a respect for the Tier'Dal,
      for their ability to master magiks in ways that we as shaman, can not. The
      Tier'Dal also worship Innoruuk allmost exclusively, which makes the shaman
      feel even more at home near them. Shaman are aware of the fact that some
      Tier'Dal view the trolls servitude of Innoruuk as a mockery. Shaman also
      notice that most Tier'Dal are very arrogant, but tend to put these things
      aside in favor of keeping the Dark elven race as an ally in the war
      against the light.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Humans:</b> Ahhh...the humans. Troll Shaman tend to despise humans
      because they realize the position of power humans now hold over most of
      the planet. The fact that several powerful humans wander around the
      Innothule killing young trolls does not help either. Human meat, as a
      rule, is no delicacy, but, when you're starving in the desert of Ro, a
      good leg of hummie doesnt sound too bad. Hummies also tend to cry, and beg
      for their lives more than some other races, especially when they feel our
      poison sweeping through their bodies and their pathetic eyesight begins to
      fail..........<br>
      <br>
      <b>Halflings, Dwarves and Gnomes:</b> Trolls find the shorter races of
      Norrath quite amusing. Shaman especially like halflings. Now, it is true
      that a good roast dwarf is a tasty treat, (just ask Carver Kagek in grobb.;),
      but nothing beats a halfling. Haflings tend to be a bit softer than the
      other races as well, and nothing squeals like a diseased halflie. ;)<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Elven Races:</b> I don't mean to generalize the three groups of
      elves here, but I'm trying to write this from a troll's point of view, and
      to a troll, an elf is an elf. Elves are all regarded as weak, pointy-eared
      hummies, allthough their skin is a bit tougher. The shaman do not fully
      understand the elves, nor do they seek to. An elf succumbs to Innoruuk's
      infection just like anyone else, and for a shaman, that is all one needs
      to know.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Barbarians:</b> The hardy northlanders are a bit of a paradox to troll
      shaman. To all other trolls, barbarians are just strong, battle-bred
      hummies, but it is not that simple for troll shamen. Barbarians, you see,
      are the only &quot;good&quot; race in Norrath that practice Shamanism, and
      this perplexes troll shamen. It is because of this that troll shamen have
      a kind of respect for the barbarian peoples, and will deal with them in
      buisness. However, when Innoruuk's will moves us, a barbarian shaman will
      go just like the rest..........slowly.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, I hope I have helped out any aspiring troll shamen out
      there. There are strikingly few of us around these days (most shamen tend
      to be barbarians...blech..). If you want to crusade for the light, then by
      all means, start a barbarian. But if you want the same shaman powers with
      a major evil twist and some fun roleplaying potential, then I would
      suggest you try out a troll. It's not for everyone....but its definately
      for me! I hope to see many fledgling troll shamen running around soon.
      Gbal the shadowknight, Xaleos the wizard and myself could allways use a
      little more help carving up the Commons Guards. :)<br>
