      <P><FONT color=#ffffff face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>If you're like me, you're always continually out of arrows when you need them the most.  Being on Dragon faction in Velious, there is a quest that can help you resolve this problem.  With a little work on your throwing skill, you can have a replacement for pulling when you're all out of arrows.  My comments are between the "***"<BR><BR>

<B>Bracer of Hammerfal quest</B><BR><BR>

This quest starts with Sentry Kale in the bakery in SkyShrine, one of his three quests.  Need Indifferent Claws Of Veeshan Faction<BR><BR>

<B>You say, 'Hail Sentry Kale'</B><BR><BR>

<B>Sentry Kale says 'Ah, the strangers, I have heard word of you. Why come you to the Skyshrine? Do you wish to be of assistance to the kin? If so, I may have a task, if you are willing.<BR><BR></B><i>***He must say this specific line before you can begin the quest, if he's not giving this line, either wait for him to be killed by hunters in the zone or kill him your self.  I was able to single pull him to the zone line with Ally faction at level 57***<BR><BR></I>

<B>You say, 'I am willing'<BR><BR></B>

<B>Sentry Kale says 'Very well, should you complete this task you will be doing a great service to the kin. As of late our supplies of velium ore have been growing short. We need to restock this supply but our normal source has run dry for the most part. Word has come to us that the Coldain are sitting on a large source of this ore and while we have no love for these Coldain, we have arranged a deal with one of their velium miners. Deliver this note along with a payment of 50 platinum to Ungdin, in the Coldain mines. Bring the velium shipment back to me and I will see about a reward.<BR><BR></B><i>*** I was dubious to dwarves and was still able to complete this part of the quest ***<BR><BR></I>

<B>You will recieve a note Go to the mines in Thurdagin and in the caves with the bats,rats, and the spiders in the middle cave, a ways in is Ungdin.</B><BR><BR><I>***As you're entering the caves from the main walkways, take the middle tunnel, then follow the right wall, this will lead you to the area he's in.  The rock on the right wall/floor will move if you click it :) ***</I><BR><BR>

<B>Give Ungdin 50 plat and the note.</B><BR><BR>  

<I>***If you're an Ogre/Troll/Barbarian (Barbarian here) you have pretty much no other option other than to A) Get a shrink from someone to get to Ungdin or B) Have a smaller race train him out of the caves to the Icewell keep zone. ***<BR><BR></I>

<B>Ungdin's eyes dart about the room before retrieving a large box from under the table. He takes the platinum and the note, then hands you the box without a word.<BR><BR></B>

<B>You will recieve a Shipment of Velium Ore Go back to Skyshrine and give Sentry Kale the shipment.</B><BR><BR>  ***I've found that it does NOT matter which quest he's giving out whether or not you receive the bracer, it's about a 20% chance of getting the bracer each time, I had to complete this quest 5 times before he would give me the bracer ***<BR><BR>

<B>Sentry Kale says 'You have shown us yet again your loyalty to our people.<BR><BR></B> 

<B>Please accept this token of our gratitude. This velium is badly needed, thank you.<BR><BR></B>

<I>*** CoV and Yelinak faction go up while giant faction goes down ***<BR><BR></I>
