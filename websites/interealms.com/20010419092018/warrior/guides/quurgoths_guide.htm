          Big, Bad, Stupid Meanie: Playing a Troll or Ogre Warrior, Levels 1-18 
          </font> </b> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
          Warrior is the backbone of any fantasy world, and this is true for Norrath. 
          The pros and cons of playing a warrior are simple. On the pro side, 
          we are strong and thus good with weapons, and can use nearly all weapons 
          and armor. We have a ton of hit points, and can double attack/dual wield 
          for excellent damage potential over time. We are desired in almost any 
          group out there. On the con side, we do not solo well after level 20 
          (although it can be done). We lack spells of any sort. We get no pets, 
          no healing abilities other than bandages, and without a healer around 
          we require a lot of downtime between battles. If you like to wade into 
          battle, take and deal mighty blows, and depend on others to save your 
          hide, this is the class for you.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Why 
          Should I Choose a Troll or Ogre Warrior?<o:p> </o:p> </b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Answer: 
          For whatever reason suits your fancy. Evil race warriors have some obvious 
          advantages to the power gamer: they are the strongest (do the most weapon 
          damage) and have the most hit points (by virtue of having the highest 
          Stamina). They can Slam, which is the same as Bash but doesn’t require 
          that the warrior hold a shield. They can see in the dark. Having pointed 
          out the reasons a k00l d00d might choose this path, however, let me 
          say that role-playing a Troll or Ogre is some of the most fun that can 
          be had in EQ. Role-playing these characters is easy: they are extremely 
          stupid (with the lowest intelligence in the game), and they love to 
          bash and eat things. Other characters enjoy interacting with role-players, 
          so play your role to the hilt. Role-playing also carries rewards other 
          than pure enjoyment: I can’t count the number of times I have received 
          great buffs or excellent transaction prices because I requested in character 
          “Duz youse got anny buffs fur dis Troll?” or “Me wants da 5pp fur da 
          bone chippies, but if youse not rich me kin take da 3pp.” I get a lot 
          of “LOL” (laughing out loud) responses, and almost always get the buff 
          or outrageously good prices.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Character 
          Creation<o:p> </o:p> </b></font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
          debate about which attributes to increase has been held at length elsewhere, 
          but my conclusion is that the best you can do for yourself is to put 
          nearly all your points into Strength, with the remaining points in Stamina. 
          This will ensure you can wear heavy armor, can use heavy weapons, will 
          hit for high damage, and will have a goodly number of hit points. This 
          will make soloing through the early levels easier, and will allow you 
          to do your job admirably in the higher levels.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">One 
          other alternative, which I am exploring with a secondary character, 
          is maxing out your Dexterity. This allows for frequent Critical Hits 
          and Crippling Blows, and also leads to much more frequent weapon procs 
          (very handy at higher levels).</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Hotkeys<o:p> 
          </o:p></b><o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You 
          will need to set up hotkeys (an art in and of itself) to your taste. 
          Regardless of your configuration, you will NEED to learn Sense Heading 
          and Taunt, which means you must hotkey them and spam (hit repeatedly) 
          them during every battle. Sense Heading is fairly self-explanatory. 
          When it works, you know which direction you’re going. Taunting is one 
          of the primary skills for a tank in a group. When you taunt a creature, 
          it becomes enraged at you and attacks you. This is good: you don’t want 
          a mob (Monster Or Beast) attacking your puny spell-casters and healers. 
          Your job is going to be making sure you are the primary attacker, soaking 
          up damage and allowing your group to stay alive. This is more fun than 
          it might sound, and it’s what a warrior is all about.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Any 
          time you get into a group in which you are the primary tank, make sure 
          you ask “has everyone set up an assist hotkey?” This will remind players 
          to hotkey /assist so that they are all fighting what you are targeting. 
          This is very important, as taking the mobs down one at a time is MUCH 
          more efficient than fighting individually.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The 
          Early Years: Learning to Bash Dem Baddies (Level 1-7)<o:p></o:p></b><o:p> 
          </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
          early years (level 2-7) of a Troll or Ogre warrior’s life should be 
          spent in Innothule Swamp, the newby area immediately outside the Grobb, 
          for Troll, or in the Feerrott, for Ogres. Either way, your first task 
          is to read the note in your inventory (right-click on the note to read 
          it) and follow the instructions. You will then receive some experience 
          and your guild tunic, which will serve as your armor until you get better 
          items from corpses. I recommend saving your skill practices for now, 
          or putting them into kick.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
          getting your tunic, find and kill whatever creatures con white or lower. 
          My own recommendation is that you kill decaying skeletons whenever possible, 
          since the bone chips they drop can be sold to necromancers and shadow 
          knights. When you have 20 chips, do a /who necro, which will give you 
          the names of all necromancers in the zone. Then /tell anyone you find 
          on that list that “Me gots bone chippies fur sale. Duz youse wanna buy 
          dem?” You can often get 5pp per stack this way, which is a ton of money 
          for an early character.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Killing 
          the various newby-level mobs in your newby area should suffice for getting 
          you through level 6 in no time. If you can group with a shaman, do so, 
          as this will reduce downtime, and there is a 50% bonus added to all 
          experience gained in a group.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>No 
          Longer A Child: Becoming a Warrior (Level 7-13)<o:p> </o:p></b><o:p></o:p> 
          </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At 
          level 8 (or sooner, if you have a group), it’s time to head for the 
          Feerrott and my favorite place in Norrath for making money and gaining 
          experience. As you zone into the Feerrott from Innothule, turn left 
          and follow the zone wall until you reach the river. Follow the river 
          until you reach the second bridge. Cross the bridge, and turn right, 
          staying VERY close to the water’s edge. When you get to the zone wall, 
          turn left. From Oggok, simply follow the path straight out from Oggok, 
          turn right at the river after crossing the bridge, and turn left at 
          the zone wall. There is the PROMISED LAND.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
          corner of the Feerrott contains a set of three stone structures. Around 
          each of the first two structures you see there will be 3 skeletons each, 
          with a somewhat tougher zombie spawning in place of a skeleton on occasion. 
          The corner (farthest) structure will have 5 skeletons/zombies. If you 
          are careful, you will be able to fight one skeleton or zombie at a time 
          for as long as you wish. The bone chips will accumulate rapidly, and 
          the Feerrott almost always contains a few camps of high-level types, 
          so you will have a ready market for your chips. My own warrior accumulated 
          over 100pp in two levels by slaughtering skellies here. Other loot (rusty 
          weapons, zombie skins, etc.) can be sold in Oggok. To get to Oggok from 
          the skeleton camps, head back to the river and follow it to the large 
          bridge. Cross the bridge and continue straight to the zone wall. Turn 
          left at the zone wall, and you will find Oggok. Merchants there will 
          sell/buy with both Trolls and Ogres.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When 
          you no longer get experience from the skeletons and zombies, or when 
          you’re bored of that camp, you can turn your attention to lizard men. 
          The lizard men in the Feerrott are nothing like the Iksar, so don’t 
          worry about taking faction hits when fighting them. The lizard men are 
          a good source of experience for levels 9-12, and their tails and meat 
          are quest loot. Be warned, however, that the Lizard Man Mystics are 
          tougher than the Lizard Man Warriors. The best spot to kill lizards 
          is outside Cazic Thule, a dungeon for groups of mid-20 level types. 
          To get to Cazic Thule from the skeleton camp, follow the river to the 
          large bridge. Cross the bridge, and continue following the river in 
          the same direction. When you reach the second bridge (which is smaller 
          and brownish in color), cross the river again and head left. You will 
          find a gigantic stone structure with five small pyramids in front of 
          it. Each of the pyramids will have a lizard man warrior or mystic atop 
          it, with occasional wandering lizzies nearby. Bash them to death, as 
          this is a great spot for your level.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Keep 
          the tails and meats, as they can be turned in to the warrior trainers 
          in Oggok. One of the trainers wants four tails at a time, and in return 
          will give you a faction adjustment (important for Trolls), rawhide or 
          patchwork armor, and experience. The trainer next to him wants four 
          meats at a time, but will not offer the quest to Trolls. If you are 
          a Troll, you will need to find a newby to group with you and give the 
          meats to the Ogre. This will give you experience, armor, and faction, 
          but you can let the newby keep the armor as a reward, or pay them a 
          plat. They need the money. These quests will also adjust faction for 
          Clurg, which is important in getting the Grobb Cleaver quest later on.</font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Getting 
          Equipped: Level 13-18<o:p></o:p></b><o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At 
          level 13, you have received your Dual Wield skill. This allows you to 
          wield 1H weapons in both hands. Pour every practice skill point you 
          have saved into this skill, and you will start to become a storm of 
          blades. For the next few levels you will only occasionally get attacks 
          off with your secondary weapon, but as your skill with DW increases 
          you will get more and more attacks. This is even more valuable at level 
          15, when you get Double Attack. Again, pour all your practice skill 
          points (save your points from level 14!) into this new skill. This will 
          allow you to occasionally get two attacks per round, or even four attacks 
          per round with Dual Wield.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">By 
          now, you will be ready to head out into the great big world. My own 
          suggestion is that your first order of business be to acquire some better 
          armor, and possibly weapons. Remember, AC is the most important stat, 
          so always put armor ahead of weapons. The best place on my server (E’ci) 
          to buy items is the tunnel between North Ro and E. Commons. To get there, 
          zone north from the swamp to South Ro, head north by northwest, zone 
          to Oasis, head north, zone to North Ro, head north by northeast, and 
          you will find the tunnel entrance. Once there, buy as much bronze plate 
          armor (or banded, if no bronze is available) as possible. You might 
          also buy Langesaxes, which are magical swords with a good damage/delay 
          ratio. Bronze plate armor should cost 2pp per AC, banded closer to 1pp 
          per AC. Langseaxes might be available for 20pp each, give or take some 
          plat.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Once 
          you are equipped, you are ready to head to Oasis and battle Orcs, Drybones 
          Skeletons, Caimans and Crocodiles, Mummies, and a host of other baddies. 
          By now you will be more likely to fight in groups, which will reduce 
          downtime dramatically. You will also begin to learn and understand your 
          role as tank, using your taunting skills, huge reserve of hit points, 
          and blades of death, all while your other non-tank group members cower 
          in the second line, away from the fun.<o:p> </o:p> </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Oasis 
          is a great place to adventure, as there are always many people there, 
          and there is a good range of bad guys. A word of warning: the Oasis 
          is also populated by a few baddies that can kill you in seconds. If 
          anyone shouts about a Sand Giant, Lockjaw, or Spectre, get as far as 
          possible from the action. These guys will kill you before you land a 
          single blow.</font></p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">By 
          now you have advanced far enough in your bashing to have developed your 
          own strategies, roles, and network of friends. Perhaps you have joined 
          a guild, or maybe you are still soloing. Regardless, remember that EQ 
          is a game and should only be played if you are having fun. My tank is 
          by far my favorite character, and I hope this guide has given you some 
          ideas for your own enjoyment. If you ever see me in game (Quurgoth,
