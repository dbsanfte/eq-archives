                  is only available by completing this quest. You must own the 
                  Legacy of Ykesha expansion in order to complete it. This is 
                  the lower level version of the fabled shaman spell Torpor, and 
                  definitely worth the effort, especially given the difficulty 
                  many shamans have in acquiring Torpor. You may need help for 
                  parts of the quest, but should certainly be able to handle all 
                  of it with a group of approximately that level. There are reports 
                  that folks in their low 50s can solo the entire quest. This 
                  guide is based entirely on the submissions made by folks on

                  of the items involved for this quest are No Drop. There is at 
                  least one report that it has been successfully multiquested.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Drunken 
                  Pirates</b> are found in the harbor area of the Gulf of Gunthak 
                  or Dulak's Harbor. To get there, from the lighthouse in Gunthak 
                  put up sow, levitate, and invis, and run due south until you 
                  reach the beach. Hug the right wall of the beach and as long 
                  as your invis holds you should make it to the back safely. Find 
                  the cave at the rear, right corner of the beach, check invis, 
                  and follow the right wall to the harbor area. If you are not 
                  evil with sufficient faction, you can safely explore this area 
                  with the use of Invisibility, as long as it holds. The southwest 
                  corner of the town area is a good camp to try. The zone is very 
                  close from there, affording a quick escape route. Setting up 
                  just a bit inside the path to the zone will also let you avoid 
                  the wandering guards. Just be sure to watch who else is around 
                  so you can be prepared for trains. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                  you want to try Dulak's Harbor, head down the tunnel from that 
                  SW camp in Gunthak to zone into Dulak. From there, a safe spot 
                  can be reached if you turn right along the wall. There is a 
                  row of small buildings with a large building alongside them. 
                  Outside of that large building opposite the second to last small 
                  building is a small pile of crates or barrels. If you stand 
                  a couple steps to the side of those barrels (with them between 
                  you and the building), you will be safe from wanderers and will 
                  not agro anything from inside the building. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  <b>Empty Flask</b> might drop for you right away or might take 
                  some intensive camping. Do not confuse it with the Broken Bottle, 
                  which is a completely different item. Reports indicate that 
                  this is a challenging but doable solo at 44+. They hit hard 
                  so slowing is a major priority. You may be able to get single 
                  pulls if you pull with slow and not with damaging spells, and 
                  if you pull the closest first. You will only get two if they 
                  are standing very close together. You may wish to use invis 
                  to find and target the pirates and run back to your camp spot 
                  before casting. That does, however, prevent you from keeping 
                  a pet up.</font></p>

                  <b>impassive sea spirit</b> is at 700, -300, -150 in the Gulf 
                  of Gunthak, underwater in a sunken boat about halfway between 
                  the lighthouse and the shore. Be sure to put up some form of 
                  underwater breathing before going down. The spirit is very small, 
                  so be sure to look carefully. The Large Rock is giant and very 
                  heavy, so do not do this step unless you have bags that can 
                  accomodate Giant items or an open inventory space. <b>Flotsam 
                  and Jetsam</b> are not agro and easily single pulled. Be prepared 
                  to root as they may run at low health. They in the high 30s 
                  or low 40s and not especially resistant to slow or dots. Reports 
                  are that they hit in the 60s or so.</font></p>
