        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
          quiet night sky falls over Freeport. The starts shining brightly upon 
          the adventurers that pass through the city. As the dark night falls, 
          Waran sits in the Arena amongst his trainers that have trained him in 
          the art of battle all through his years. As he sits, he removes helm 
          and begins sharpening his newly discovered blade from the new lands 
          with a sharpening rock. Up and down the edges, he takes such great care 
          in perfecting his weapon to meet his own requirements. Visually, you 
          can see the wear on Waran’s armor. A couple of dents, scratches, and 
          indentations here and there, its not that obvious, but quite a bit of 
          difference than the armor you see younger Warriors start out with. Waran 
          starts to reflect on his battles and adventures in his life. Exploring 
          Blackburrow for the first time, seeking revenge on the Snow Orc Shaman 
          in Everfrost with Xirius, his first trip across Antonica to seek out 
          his future LOA brethren, his first trip into Crushbone, his first Hill 
          Giant kill, all these images flood through his mind as he concentrates 
          on repairing his swords and armor. </font></p>
        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
          he continues, there is a noticeable running noise coming from the Arena 
          entrance. At once, all the guildtrainers give out an audible sound of 
          &quot;Ugh..&quot; as the young Warrior heads towards Waran and the guildtrainers. 
          Waran looks up to see who is giving the trainers so much pain in training 
          him and was quite surprised to see who it was. Young Warazan clambers 
          up the steps, fumbling over his own two feet, towards his father and 
          the guildtrainers, practically bringing every armor piece, weapon, sword, 
          item, you name it, with him in his stuffed pack. He, on many instances, 
          had asked every guildtrainer in Freeport which was better than which. 
          Waran stands up from his armor and newly sharpened weapon, moving toward 
          the guild head master. All that he does is nod to the head guild trainer, 
          letting him know, nonverbally, that he would take over training him 
          since he was back in Freeport from Kunark….</font></p>
        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Warazan 
          could sense that his father was not pleased with him and followed behind 
          him with his head down in shame. Waran heads back to his items, puts 
          his armor on and heads to one of the side rooms in the Arena where he 
          can talk to Warazan alone. As Waran enters the room, he puts his things 
          down and quickly turns around to Warazan, seeing him with his head down. 
          &quot;Warriors never look down in shame son, pull your chin up&quot; 
          in a very strict tone, Waran says to his son. &quot;You’ve been aways 
          so long poppa, sisy Cali be too bigs for me ta fight with her no more, 
          and me haven’t seen momma since I be born pracktikly!&quot; Warazan 
          mutters. Waran looks at his son intently with increasing concern, &quot;Who 
          has been training you and what have you been doing?&quot; he questions. 
          &quot;Well….me got sleepy….been sleepin and kinda missed all dem training 
          tingys….didn’t mean ta, just couln get up., Warazan says. &quot;Let 
          me start with the basics then, since it appears you’ve decided to sleep 
          instead of attending formal Warrior training. Question 1. What is a 
          Warrior?&quot; Waran begins. &quot;Someone who fights a lot?&quot; Warazan 
          says in a snap. Waran grins as he looks at his son and says, &quot;Is 
          that all we are?&quot; Warazan completely confused, scratching his head, 
          only answers with silence. &quot;You definitely have much to learn my 
          young Warrior son, lets begin&quot;…</font></p>
        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>A 
          Warrior is a master of combat. We are always in the thick of battle. 
          Fighting and taunting monsters; battling fiercely at every moment. We 
          can use any weapon, from blunt weapons, piercing weapons, throwing weapons, 
          bows, and slashing weapons, we can wield them all. We don’t put our 
          noses in books, we have time to enjoy our surroundings, always alert, 
          always ready for battle.</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>When 
          you decide to take your Oath of a Warrior, there are 3 stats that you 
          must focus on when you begin. Your Strength (STR), Stamina (STA), and 
          Agility (AGI) are the three most important stats for a Warrior to have 
          before he chooses to follow the path of the Warrior. Your STR determines 
          how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage; influences 
          how quickly you learn many offensive skills. Your STA affects how many 
          hit points you have and how long you can hold your breath underwater. 
          Your AGI affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how 
          difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when 
          you are hit. You will have +25 points to add to your base stats, so 
          depending on what you want to do with your stats, divide them accordingly. 
          When I decided to take the Oath of the Warrior for the Wolves of the 
          North, I divided my points mostly into Strength and Stamina, leaving 
          my Agility lower than usual. I do get hit more because of this, but 
          that is the way of the Warrior. You will get hit…<u>a lot</u>! You have 
          the most hit points than any other class in Norrath and rightly so. 
          You are the damage absorber, or &quot;sponge&quot; to take the hits 
          while others in your group fight by your side and blast and melee right 
          along with you. That is your job in any group that you are in.</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Warazan 
          are you listening?&quot; Waran asks intently. With a huge yawn Warazan 
          says, &quot;Yeah poppa, me tryin ta listen ta ya&quot;. Waran gives 
          Warazan an icy glare and says &quot;You better listen to me, because 
          I expect to see what you’ve learned from all this afterwards.&quot; 
          Warazan groans and says, &quot;Ok poppa&quot;…</font></p>
        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>One 
          of the most important skills to train in is Taunt. When at your specific 
          guild trainer, at level 1, you will have 5 training points after handing 
          in your guild note. You should train in 1 Handed Slash/2 Handed Slash, 
          kick and taunt, most importantly. Funny story is, I had assumed Taunt 
          was an automatic thing and was using it, untrained, all the way till 
          my 20s until a very nice Dwarven Warrior by the name of Bojo informed 
          me of my mistake. At later levels you will use Taunt very often to &quot;piss 
          off&quot; the different monsters that are attacking your group to attack 
          you instead. This is a very useful skill, especially if there is a healer 
          or caster in your group yelling and screaming at your group &quot;ONE 
          ON ME, ONE ON ME, GET IT OFF!&quot; You should be able to taunt it off 
          the frail casters with relative ease once your skill is high enough. 
          Use Taunt all the time, especially when you have a full group and are 
          fighting 1 monster, taunt taunt taunt, to increase your skill. At later 
          levels, you will use taunt selectively in different situations. You 
          should learn how to manage group damage, as is, know when to stop taking 
          damage, sit back and let others take some of the damage, then join the 
          fray again and finish the mob off. Taunt should not always be used in 
          some situations, you’ll have to determine when to taunt and when not 
          to taunt. As another note, after you skill increases to the point where 
          it costs money to train in them, don’t waste your money, it will go 
          up automatically. Later, when you get a bow and arrows, you should train 
          in Archery, as it is your effective way of pulling monsters for your 
          group to kill. Train in that and fletching where you can make your own 
          arrows rather than buying them. I suggest going to </b></i><a href="http://interealms.com/ranger/guides/arrowsintro.html"><b><i>http://interealms.com/ranger/guides/arrowsintro.html</i></b></a><b><i> 
          to find info on fletching arrow combinations, Sunmoon has quite a nice 
          list there.</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;Have 
          you trained in Taunt, son?&quot; Waran asks to make sure his son is 
          still awake. Warazan says, &quot;Me thinks so, me not sure what me trained 
          in, but me thinks dat be one of dem&quot; Waran rolls his eyes and continues…</font></p>
        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Now, 
          one question a Warrior always has is, Which weapon should I practice 
          in and fight in a majority of my time? The generic all around answer 
          is &quot;Train in them all&quot;. You never know what amazing weapon 
          will come your way down the road, and you don’t want to be in a position 
          to not be able to use a weapon because your skill is nonexistent. This 
          is something I probably should have followed myself, but nonetheless, 
          train in them all, you will thank me later. I didn’t train in 2H Slash 
          until my early to mid 20s because I didn’t see the point. Boy was I 
          wrong. It took me at least 10 levels and tons of experience points to 
          lift my 2H slash skill to where it should be and where it is today. 
          What I usually do to increase both skills is when I reach my halfway 
          point in my experience bar, I switch to my other discipline of weaponry. 
          This tactic works very well.</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;But 
          what I do wit all dis stuff me gots in mi’pack? Which be da one me should 
          use?!?&quot; Warazan says eagerly. Waran lifts his pack and dumps its 
          contents on the ground before them. It’s filled with rusty swords, bone 
          chips, cat pelts, goblin ice necklaces, and other assorted items. &quot;Sell 
          them son, you’re keep rats in here too?!?!&quot; Waran says jokingly. 
          &quot;Come on son, let’s go to the Desert of North Ro and get you some 
          better training than getting better at sleeping&quot; Waran says. Warazan 
          stands before his father in his full bronze, slouching a bit, still 
          acting if he was still asleep standing up. Waran lifts him from his 
          slouch and says, &quot;STAND WARRIOR&quot;, echoing through the halls 
          of the Freeport Arena. With guild trainers peeking around the corner, 
          Warazan immediately stands at attention. Waran moves around him in a 
          circle, adjusting his posture. &quot;By Rallos boy, ye true Warrior 
          posture needs some work!!!&quot; he says. &quot;Ok, I guess that will 
          do for now, you must not just train to be a warrior and continue in 
          your battles, you must <b><u>look and feel</u></b> the Warrior spirit 
          within you. Let it fill your mind and soul. You must follow Rallos Zek 
          and he will give you the power to do this&quot; looking into Warazan’s 
          eyes as he says this. &quot;Let’s begin son…&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font color="ffffff" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
          the sun rising slowly upon the Freeport sky, Warazan heads out of the 
          room with his father behind him. As he is walking out, Waran grins and 
          kicks Warazan in his arse, with his son falling to the ground, to have 
          a little fun with him. Waran winks at the guildtrainers to show them 
          that Warazan’s father was still able to give him a kick in his arse 
          for slacking in his Warrior ways. Warazan blushes among all the laughter 
          in the Arena, while his father comes to led him a hand getting up off 
          the ground. &quot;Learn to have fun young Warrior, learn to laugh and 
          learn to laugh at yourself&quot; with a mighty Warrior laugh. Waran 
          and Warazan both head out of the Arena, with the wind at their backs 
          and their blades drawn. To new battles and new adventures!!</font></p>
