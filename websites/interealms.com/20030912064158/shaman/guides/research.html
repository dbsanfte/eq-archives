                  Shaman's Guide to Research: Another Source of your 50-60 Spells</b>

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  Having trouble getting your 50-60 spells? Research them! Well, 
                  okay, you can't actually do the research yourself. Only the 
                  int casters (enchanters, magicians, necromancers, and wizards) 
                  can actually do research. But you can gather the ingredients 
                  for them to make you your very own copy of Levitation, Acumen 
                  of Dar Khura, or yes, even Torpor! </font></p>
                <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How 
                  does research work?</b><br>
                  Int casters are able to start researching at level 16. Their 
                  skill advances much like alchemy, with the ability to gain another 
                  5 points of skill each time they level. The highest skill a 
                  researcher can have is 200, although the use of skill modifiers 
                  like the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8275&menustr=035000000000">Geerlok 
                  Automated Quill</a> will allow their effective skill to be higher 
                  than 200. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  A researcher creates new spells by combining their ingredients 
                  in their research tome. Each of the four int caster classes 
                  has some spells under 50 that are only available by researching. 
                  None of those spells is No Drop, however, so many of them buy 
                  those spells from other people rather than investing the time 
                  and money to become researchers themselves. Just like any other 
                  tradeskill, it is a lot of work. Also, keep in mind that just 
                  like other tradeskills, researchers can fail their attempts. 
                  These recipes all have very high trivials, some over 200. So 
                  be prepared for the possibility that you may need to gather 
                  components more than once. </font></p>
                <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>My 
                  researcher has never made 50-60 spells. Is it the same?</b><br>
                  Researchers usually can only make spells for their own class. 
                  The exceptions to this are 50-60 priest spells and 50-60 spells 
                  that they share with other research classes. So any researcher 
                  can make any 50-60 spell usable by a cleric, druid, or shaman. 
                  They will need to use the advanced research container available 
                  from talking with Researcher Alvarik in the Gulf of Gunthak. 
                  In addition to the dropped ingredients, they will also need 
                  a parchment and quill available from a variety of vendors. </font></p>
                <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>So 
                  where do I get the stuff my researcher needs?</b><br>
                  The dropped ingredients come from creatures of approximately 
                  the same level as the spell being made. In cases where the same 
                  component can make spells of different levels, it is the lowest 
                  level of spell that the item can make that determines which 
                  creatures will drop it. So if a component is used to make both 
                  a 51 and a 58 spell, it will drop off creatures that are around 
                  level 51. However, the higher level spells usually have at least 
                  one or two components that are exclusively for high level spells 
                  and therefore exclusively available in difficult places. Some 
                  components, for example, have only been reported from the sewers 
                  of Cazic Thule or in Vex Thal. Yes, Vex Thal. But as none of 
                  the components are No Drop, the Bazaar is always another possible 
                  source. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  Once you have the drops that your researcher needs, pick up 
                  a piece of parchment and a quill from one of the vendors listed 
                  in the Supply Vendors in the link below. </font></p>
                <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>I 
                  can get all my 50-60 shaman spells this way?</b><br>
                  Almost. Ancient spells for any class, including shamans, cannot 
                  be researched. In addition, Primal Avatar is not researchable 
                  because it is No Drop. The scroll that is created by a researcher 
                  is identical to the one that drops. So it wouldn't do anyone 
                  any good if an int caster researchs a shaman-only No Drop spell. 
                  You will still need to go to Sleeper's Tomb for that one. </font></p>
