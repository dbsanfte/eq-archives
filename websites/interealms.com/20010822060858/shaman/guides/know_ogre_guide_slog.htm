                    An Ogre Shaman is, hands down, one of the best classes available. 
                    You will have the greatest strength and stamina of any race, 
                    and you will be able to cast extremely powerful spells including 
                    heals. Although any experience in EQ is much enhanced by grouping, 
                    these features will allow you to survive much longer soloing 
                    that any of the weaker races. As you progress in levels you 
                    will become much sought after by groups for your Spirit of 
                    Wolf spell (SOW - allows individuals to &quot;pull&quot; or 
                    flee much faster), for your heals, and for your considerable 
                    fighting/tanking ability. Granted, you will never be able 
                    to tank as well as a warrior, or heal as well as a cleric, 
                    but your mixture of powerful strengths makes an Ogre Shaman 
                    a best friend to many.</p>
                  <p> Another wonderful aspect about being an Ogre is that most 
                    Ogres are good role-players. I believe that this is because 
                    it's rather fun to talk like an Ogre. &quot;Me bash gud.&quot; 
                    &quot;You puny.&quot; &quot;Hmmm, lizzie is gud to eat.&quot; 
                    Etc. In addition, there are not many Ogres presently in existence, 
                    which makes Ogre territory less occupied and easier to find 
                    kills and good loot. It's also enjoyable to be the most massive 
                    PC in existence. You will inspire awe in others at your sheer 
                    size (not to mention the role-playing aspects of running away 
                    from a Gnome, like an elephant would run from a mouse).</p>
                  <p> Disadvantages of being an Ogre include 1) being hated by 
                    most races and 2) being huge. Travel to other areas is much 
                    more dangerous because you are KOS (Killed on Sight) by most 
                    races except the Dark Elves and Trolls. Having such a large 
                    body can also be a disadvantage in that in certain dungeons 
                    (especially Upper Guk) with narrow hallways, it can be hard 
                    to maneuver or get through if anyone is in your way. The size 
                    issue can be a huge bother - aka you can't even fit behind 
                    the throne in Crushbone. However, both of these drawbacks 
                    are tolerable and there are ways to work around them. For 
                    example, 1) you could kill what you need to, to improve faction 
                    if you really want to be in a particular region and 2) you 
                    can stay in dungeons that tend to be more open (Crushbone 
                    and Unrest have been good).</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366">The Creation</font></b><br>
                    One of the first questions is where to put your 30 additional 
                    attribute points. I have often heard a rumor that attribute 
                    points are less valuable when over 100 - I have not found 
                    this to be the case. I tested out a variety of classes and 
                    races looking at HP and Stamina as a benchmark, and have found 
                    that class has more effect on eventual HP than does Stamina.

                          is for an Ogre Shaman (aka whether you're above 100 
                          or below it, the additional HP/lvl is not huge). The 
                          additional HP will eventually make a difference, which 
                          can be seen by multiplying the level 1 HP by 10 or 20. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The Ogre Shaman does not compete with an Ogre Warrior 
                          for sheer tank ability, but will definitely hold up 
                          under fire better than any other full casting magic 
                          user (of course, keep in mind that a Shaman can bind 
                          him/herself wherever they desire, where a Warrior can 
                          only be bound in certain spots by someone else). Ogres 
                          start out with very good Strength and Stamina, and most 
                          other things are average, except Charisma, which is 
                          very poor. </p>

        <hr>
        <p>The decision of where to place your additional attributes will
        probably not have a large effect until you reach higher levels, so it is
        important to decide what kind of character you will want. If you think
        you would be content to stand back and cast spells - put a majority into
        Wisdom. If you are more interested in getting dirty and occasionally
        tanking - put a little more emphasis on Stamina. Strength is another
        good area to place some additional points - as this directly correlates
        to how much you can carry with you (something that does become very
        important when you're in enemy territory). I would not consider putting
        any points towards Charisma because you will never be getting great
        prices from NPCs as an Ogre, and secondly, because most of your selling
        will be done with other PCs who couldn't care less about your Charisma.</p>
        <p>Weapon choice is somewhat clearer. You can use 1H blunt and a shield,
        or 2H blunt. Most shaman prefer 2H blunt because it does considerably
        more damage, and the loss of a shield does not make much of a difference
        in how often you are hit (a good offense is …). Use your 1H blunt club
        that you get at the start, until you can get your hands on a decent 2H
        blunt, then switch. Obtain a magic 2H blunt (aka a Glowing Wooden Crook,
        etc) if you can, because then you will be able to hit any magic undead
        you run into (shouldn't come to these monsters until your teen levels).</p>
        <p><b><font color="#333366">The Formative Years (Rank I - Levels 1-4)</font></b><br>
        During these tender years of Rank I, I would suggest not wandering too
        far from Oggok. As you exit Oggok, if you follow the path and turn left
        at the 2 forks, you will come to an innkeeper. Adventuring behind her is
        a very good place to start. First rule of thumb - ALWAYS /con what you
        are about to attack. Green, blue and white (if you're feeling brave) are
        your best bets, where yellows and reds will likely end up in a corpse
        recovery trip. Second rule of thumb - Always keep a reference point so
        that you know where you are. Pick unusual landmarks and focus on
        recognizing them, so that when you do die (and you will die) you know
        where your corpse is. Third rule of thumb - Get accustomed to picking
        off wandering critters with spells - using Burst of Flame to bring them
        to you instead of chasing them down is a valuable, timesaving skill,
        plus it helps keep your bearings. Grouping is usually not recommended at
        Rank 1-4, but can always be fun for periods.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#333366">The Troublesome 2's (Rank II - Levels 5-8)</font></b><br>
        I say that these years are troublesome because by these levels you have
        gained substantial power, but still have to show restraint as to where
        you wander. After level 4, when you die you will lose experience, so
        restraint can be very helpful in the long run. From levels 5-8 I would
        suggest hitting the lesser lizzie camps - there are three of them which
        you will find if you wander behind the inn. One of the nicest things
        about these levels is that grouping becomes more helpful. When you are
        hitting the lesser lizzie camps and suddenly a couple Lizardman Mystics
        respawn and blind you; it will be helpful to have a friend close by.
        During this period you should also start working on getting better armor
        and weapons - admittedly a life long struggle.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#333366">Introduction of Spirit of Wolf (Rank III -
        Levels 9-13)</font></b><br>
        Level 9 brings one of the greatest boons to Shamen - Spirit of Wolf
        (SOW). You will become a very valuable member of any team, simply for
        this reason, not to mention the rest of your skills. This spell is
        incalculably helpful in that it allows you to run much faster than
        normally. It allows you to travel faster though difficult zones, and it
        allows you to flee from a fight that has turned out to be much harder
        that you initially though. At level 9, armed with SOW, the brave can
        consider wandering over to the stronger lizzie camps with friends or the
        smaller temples outside Cazic Thule. It is here that you can receive
        incredible payoffs from the lizards, but the region is typically busy
        for this reason. You should attempt to replace whatever armor you have
        with the stronger banded armor - which can be purchased from other PCs.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#333366">The World is your Oyster (Rank IV - Levels
        14-18)</font></b><br>
        By level 14 you should now have a good idea of what to expect from the
        temples, and are starting to find it easy, being less wary of lizzie
        trains. The greatest blessing of level 14 is Bind Affinity. Bind allows
        you to set your gate (or death) point. One word on obtaining this spell
        - it presently is not available in either Oggok or Grobb, so you have to
        get it in Neriak, or pay someone to buy it for you. One of the major
        advantages of being able to cast the spell (as opposed to having someone
        else cast it on you) is that you can bind yourself anywhere. Common
        sense become very handy in deciding where you should bind yourself…
        needless to say staying close to zones and choosing safe locations is
        very wise. With this ability, exploring the world becomes much safer.
        You can travel anywhere and bind yourself near the zone, knowing that if
        you die you will not have to walk back all the way from Feerrott.
        Because of your newly found freedom, you can wander the lands, amazing
        people who have never seen an Ogre before. Take caution however, because
        most lands will be very dangerous to you, not because of the monsters
        that may lay ahead, but because of the foul guards that may inhabit the
        region. Any regions that have a city in or adjacent to them (besides
        Feerrott and Innothule Swamp) will have wandering guards of very high
        levels (higher 30's) who will likely kill you on sight (KOS).</p>
        <p>A little dying trick - If you die and your corpse happens to be in a
        relatively dangerous area, there is an easy way to get it out of harms
        way. 1) Make a social button (by R clicking it) into a corpse retrieval
        button - /Corpse. 2) Pay someone for an invis (Enchanters have the
        strongest invis) while standing as near as SAFELY possible to where you
        died. 3) Quickly run close to your corpse, and start hitting the Corpse
        button as you walk away from the dangerous region. Voila - your corpse
        is now somewhere where you can loot it with peace of mind! Now I would
        say that this is something you should only do if it is very necessary.
        For example, if you corpse happened to be right in front of the Felwithe
        guards.</p>
        <p><b><font color="#333366">A New Role (Rank V - Level 19-23)</font></b><br>
        At Rank V, you finally get a strong healing spell and you will find that
        your role in groups tends to shift to a healer more often. It is nice to
        have the option of standing back and healing Warriors or other Tanks, or
        choosing to get into the fray. At level 20, you can have a last name and
        will have more than enough experience as to what you want to do, so I
        will no longer presume to advise you. ;)</p>
