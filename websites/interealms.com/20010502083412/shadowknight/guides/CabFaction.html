A common question these post-Kunark days is how to fix their faction in Cabalis.
The Iksar are secretive, and by default hate everyone.  Fixing faction with the guards
is easy for anyone who fights in Kunark, but NathanBouk devised a way to be liked by
everyone in the city.  It's very tedious, and a tad tricky, but if you really want access
to the central city of Kunark, it might just be for you.
<P>
First, a little on the numeric side of faction.  Internally, faction are represented as a
signed integer number.  This number ranges from -2000 (scowling) to +2000 (warmly).  Dubious
is located at -500, and indifferent at 0.  The Cabalis factions are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>LegionsOfCabalis - Iksar guards
<LI>Crusaders of Greenmist - Iksar shadowknights
<LI>CabalisResidents - Cabalis merchants
<LI>SwiftTails - Iksar monks
<LI>BroodOfKotiz - Iksar Necromancers
<LI>TheForsaken - Renegade Iksar, killing these mobs improves BroodOfKotiz faction
</UL>
<P>
The key to this fix is the Trooper Mozo bone chip quest located in the Field of Bone.
Bone chips are stackable and easily found or (hopefully)
purchased.  You merely give him 4 bone chips at a time (stacked will work), and in return get
faction with all Cabalis faction except the necromancers.  Also, note that if you do any
of the other faction quests, you will get +3 points to LegionOfCabalis, but only +1 to the 
others, which can make it difficult or impossible to become well liked in the rest of the
city.
<P>
In order to do this quest, you will first need to be non-KOS to the guards, unless you 
are a rogue that can sneak, or a bard with an Iksar Mask.  The key to getting your faction
fixed with Cabalis is to become just barely glowered at.  This will take about 500 faction hits
from Frogloks, Sarnaks, Renegade Iksar, or Goblins.  Which should you kill?  If you're starting from
scratch, and about to go butcher a slew of greens, think about the following.  Killing sarnaks
has a small chance of obtaining a Sarnak Earring of Station (a very nice nodrop earring).  Killing
renegade Iksar (TheForsaken) will give you necro faction.  Killing goblins improves your Firiona Vie
faction.  The all important part of this is to stop when you are just barely glowered at there.
<P>
Now the fun part.  Once you are glowered at by the guards, you need to get alot of bone chips.
If you worship Cazic Thule or are Agnostic, you will start at -1000 to all faction in Cabalis.  If
you worship Innorukk or Bertoxxulos you start out -1000 to guards, -1300 to everyone else, and -2000
to the residents.  If you killed 500 things for faction hits, you can do the bone chip quest 1500 times
for 1 faction point per quest.  That's a total of 6000 bone chips, so get to work.  If you plan on getting 
bone chips yourself, you should go to the Paineel newbie zone.  You can rack up about 2 backpacks full of
bone chips in about an hour and a half.  Of course a better way is to pay newbies for them.  You'll probably
have to pay 2pp per stack of 20 bone chips, perhaps more.  A good place to buy them is in the field of bone,
or Kurn's tower.  You'll have to make multiple trips to Mozo to turn in that many bone chips.
<P>
Beware!  Not all the guards are LegionsOfCabalis.  The Crusaders that patrol Field of Bone are still
KOS to you.  Avoid them as they are Shadowknights, but on the Necro faction.  Use invis (they can't see invis)
and sneak up to Mozo, and get a ways behind him.  Then begin turning in your bone chips.  You might want to 
invis and wait if a Crusader walks by.-
<P>
If you killed too many goblins or whatever before you began turning in bone chips, you might be in trouble.
Once your faction gets to +2001, you no longer receive any faction hits from doing the bone chip quest, and you
might not be able to get non-KOS to the SK guild and merchants.  If you killed more than 1200 mobs, you will
be unable to fix your faction with bone chips.  You then need to lower your LegionsOfCabalis faction to continue,
which leaves two horrible options:
<OL><LI>Kill a Trooper (Good luck0
<LI>Do the Drolvarg teeth quest in FV (turn in 4 teeth)
</OL>
<P>
What about the necro's?  Once you have fixed your faction with the rest of Cabalis, it's easy to fix your
necro faction.  Simply find a renegade Iksar camp (Iksar Manslayers or Bandits, any TheForsaken mob will do)
and camp it until you stop getting hits.  It will probably take about 800 to get to dubious.
<P>
After doing this, you probably want to bump up your CabalisResidents faction a bit more.  The way to do this is
with the Curscale armor quest, given by a the bristle silk merchant in the Haggle Baron's building.  Although 
you will be KOS to him, he will treat you as if you were dubious, and let you do the quest.  You must fill a
container with 8 curscale skins, combine it, and return it.  Do this until you are able to buy and bank in the
city.  Make sure to do the bone chips first, though.
<P>
You should still be wary of your new found friends.  A bug exists where if you log in next to a mob that you've
fixed the faction for, it may still attack you, as it takes a second or two for it to apply the faction changes 
you've worked hard for.
