                  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">From the
                  unedited diary of </span>Jorgurdar, Shaman of the Tribunal:</p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>Indeed! In fact I do have the spell scribed and memmed.
                  It seems that after<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>talking
                  to the Herb Vendor in Firiona Vie, she wanted me to search for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>components for her alchemy practices. I, of course, was
                  more than willing to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>help.<o:p>
                  </o:p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>It turned out she needed 4 components. Clay Ghiosk,
                  Powder of Yun, Crushed Dread<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Diamonds,
                  and (what she said was the hardest) Bones of one from the Bath
                  of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Obolus. I was
                  quite baffled, because I had never heard of any of these.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>So, off to the wilderness I went. I had heard from a
                  friend that there was a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>place
                  nearby they called the Dreadlands, and did the name ever fit.
                  This place<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>had these
                  nasty spiders that looked like an evil Dark Elf experiment
                  gone bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
                  are half (lower) spider and half (upper) dark elf, and cast
                  wizard and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>druid
                  spells. There were Dovlrogs of the most difficult kind,
                  wearing bronze and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>ruined
                  scale armor on their mean dog bodies. Also, I saw oversized
                  monkeys that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>folks
                  called Brutes and there were mountain giants too! And these
                  birds that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>looked
                  nothing like the aviaks I knew. The veterans of this land
                  called them<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>&quot;chickens&quot;!
                  (quite tasty when cooked, I had heard).&nbsp;<o:p>
                  </o:p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well,
                  after spending some time fighting the hordes of evil in the
                  dreadlands, I<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>ventured
                  to a crumbling castle called Karnor's Castle. Once inside, our
                  small<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>band of
                  travellers found the castle overrun by even more powerful
                  Dovlrogs and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>undead of
                  every kind. Detached hands and spectres and vile skeletons of
                  all<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>kinds. And what
                  luck! After killing a skeleton, I sifted thru the bones of
                  that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>skeleton (which,
                  by the markings of its tattered uniform, seemed to be a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>warlord) and found some bizarre Greyish Bones. I asked
                  my groupmates if I could<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>just
                  stash them away, since they looked like garbage to everyone
                  else. As soon<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>as I
                  picked the bones up, I felt a bond to them and knew I couldn't
                  drop them if<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I wanted
                  to. I later found out that these were the bones of obolus I
                  was looking<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>for!&nbsp;<o:p>
                  </o:p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
                  the storming of the castle, we all retreated to the comfort of
                  the local<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>tavern in
                  Firiona Vie and there is where I heard of a large group of
                  people<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>heading to the
                  mysterious City of Mist. A city that was overrun with undead<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>minions and the evil black reavers. It was the black
                  reavers and their evil<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>master
                  Lord Ghiosk that the group was after. At the mention of the
                  name Ghiosk,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>my
                  ears perked up and I started wondering if I might be able
                  investigate this<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>city
                  with them. After all, it might hold the secret to the Clay of
                  Ghiosk that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the Herb
                  woman was looking for. Fortunately for me, I have compatriots
                  in Clan<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Bravewill, who
                  were the people going, and they had heard of me and wished for
                  me<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>to join them. I was
                  quite honored to join them. The next morning, we sneaked<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>into the City and along the way were met with little
                  resistance, and even killed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>a
                  behemoth of the local army, and upon inspecting his corpse, I
                  found some<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Strange
                  Ochre Clay. I put this clay in my pocket, as I could have an
                  enchanter<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>cast his
                  Identify magic on it and learn what it really was, as I had
                  learned to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>do with the
                  Bones I had found in that vile castle. It seems in the newly<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>discovered lands of Kunark, some things are not as they
                  appear. Well, Lord<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Ghiosk
                  fell to the victorious Clan Bravewill and upon returning to
                  the elfie<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>outpost of
                  Firiona Vie, I happened upon an enchanter who identified the
                  clay as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the Clay of
                  Ghiosk I needed. I was half way through my quest.&nbsp;<o:p>
                  </o:p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Well,
                  many days went on and I joined up with many others to fight
                  the minions of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>evil
                  outside of that outpost. It seemed I had inadvertently joined
                  up with the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>hearty band
                  of rabble at the outpost. Upon my travels thru one of the
                  nearby<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>swamps, I had
                  heard that there were Froglok Shamans in the area. Thinking
                  maybe<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I could visit
                  them and possibly exchange greetings and maybe learn new
                  shamanic<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>magics, I went
                  in search of them. And, oh, how I did find them. They were
                  quite<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>hostile and
                  wanted to kill me as soon as they saw me. Not as nice as their<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>apparent relatives in the ruins of Guk on Atonica I had
                  once visited. Realizing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>that
                  these frogloks were tainted by the evil of Kunark, I enlisted
                  a small band<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>and
                  started to slay the ones who tried to come too near me. On the
                  corpse of one<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>of the
                  shamans was an odd powder. Remembering that the Herb woman
                  wanted some<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>powder I
                  searched out for another enchanter who after identifying the
                  powder,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>told me it was
                  Nok and Tal powder (see, I had two packets of it), but nei<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>ther was Powder of Yun. But I was sure I had stumbled
                  onto something.&nbsp;<o:p>
                  </o:p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Overhearing
                  my conversation with the enchanter was a ranger named Brilon
                  who<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>informed me that
                  there were also more of these Kunark frogloks in a jungle-like<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>land called Trakanon's Teeth, named after the vile
                  dragon Trakanon. He said he<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>would
                  venture to Trak (as we were prone to call it) and help me find
                  more<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>frogloks. I had
                  learned that most people see frogloks and think that if you
                  see<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>one froglok, you
                  have seen them all. Not so true. I have learned how to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>distinguish them from their markings. Well, anyway,
                  upon entering Trak, the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>ranger
                  came upon the trail of a froglok. After tracking it down, it
                  definitely<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>had the
                  markings of no Froglok I had ever seen.&nbsp;<o:p>
                  </o:p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
                  it attacked! He gave up a good fight, but in the end was not
                  even able to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>withstand
                  the power of a real Shaman! Methinks that the frogloks do not
                  train<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>their shamans as
                  well as we train our barbarian ones. As it turned out, this<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>shaman also had some powder, which I pocketed, and
                  again felt that special bond<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>to
                  the powder, knowing I couldn't drop it. This time my luck was
                  in. Upon<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>returning to
                  Firiona Vie, the powder turned out to be Yun Powder, and I
                  realized<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>that the
                  Froglok must have been a Yun Shaman.&nbsp;<o:p>
                  </o:p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
                  was quite happy having found 3 of the 4 components for the

                  still plagued with not knowing where in the world to find the

                  that she wanted me to find. I had looked all over the
                  Dreadlands and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>didn't
                  find any clues, until I saw my friend Hiker the Druid. Ahh,
                  Hiker. He is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>a good
                  friend I hadn't seen in forever it seemed. We sat and talked
                  of old times<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>and I
                  realized that the last time I had seen him was when we first
                  teleported to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Kunark
                  and went to search the lost valley on the western edge of the
                  dreadlands.<o:p>
                  </o:p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
                  had forgotten all about the lost valley! I remember we were
                  killing some<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>skeletons
                  in an undead city that had pyramids bigger than any I had ever
                  seen<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>before. And one
                  skeleton that we had sent back to its maker the locals had
                  told<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>me was commonly
                  known as the Gem Cutter Skeleton. I actually remembered that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>skeleton, so after a little discussion with Hiker, we
                  figured that the gem<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>cutter
                  skeleton might hold the secret to the Crushed Dread Diamonds.&nbsp;<o:p>
                  </o:p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
                  off I went to the pyramid city, and sure enough the gemcutter
                  skeleton was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>there, but
                  it wanted to fight with me instead of talking. It was quite
                  weak, so<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>it didn't hurt
                  me at all, so I asked Hiker to locate me an Enchanter (thank
                  The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Tribunal for
                  Enchanters!) to charm him, so he wouldn't be so aggressive to
                  me<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>and maybe we could
                  talk. I knew that enchanters had this powers, see, because by<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>now I had spent so much time with them. So, Hiker used
                  his druidic teleportation<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>powers
                  to travel around the world looking for people he might know,
                  and I used<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>my powers to
                  send a telepathic message to all of the dreadlands, seeking an<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>enchanter.<o:p>
                  </o:p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>It turned out a powerful shaman (yes, even more
                  powerful than me!) was married<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
                  </span>to an enchanter, but was away for a little time. Then
                  Hiker came back with an<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>enchanter
                  he had found too, named Kissie, who charmed the skeleton and
                  sure<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>enough, this
                  tortured soul (the skeleton, not Kissie) wanted to finally
                  talk. It<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>had knowledge
                  of, what it called, sparklies. Weny piped up then and asked it
                  for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>a dread diamond.
                  (turns out that the Herb vendor woman had enlisted quite a few<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

                  that for a Dufrenite, it<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>would
                  hand over a Dread Diamond. This time Kissie had to leave, but
                  Weny's<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>husband had
                  finally arrived, so he kept his charming magic on the skeleton
                  while<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Weny and I went
                  to town to buy a dufrenite.&nbsp;<o:p>

                  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
                  I gave the dufrenite to the skeleton and received the diamond,
                  the skeleton<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>told me it

                  Weny<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>had said that
                  spectral pestles were found in the dungeon of Kaesora and had<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

                  Weny was quite proficient, and off to Kaesora she went, while

                  </span>Two days later, Weny comes back with an amazing tale of

                  who had pestles on them and how she had crushed the diamonds.
                  I<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>congratulated her on
