          Apocrypha's Guide to Level 20</font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
          state the obvious, warriors are the least independent of all classes. 
          They don't have any special abilities. They soak up damage, and they 
          deal it out. I personally don't see this as a disadvantage - no one 
          can do what they do better, and as the game progresses, it becomes harder 
          and harder to get by without one. What is important to understand when 
          playing a warrior, though, is that you can't do very much solo. When 
          looking for a place to hunt, you need to think about how easy it will 
          be to find other people to group with so that they can heal, nuke, mez, 
          stun, or fear - anything to keep your downtime to a minimum. This is 
          what I have kept in mind in creating this guide. Places that I might 
          go with my magician, I would not go to with my warrior at the same level, 
          it's as simple as that.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Levels 
          1-5:<br>
          </b>These levels are the same for pretty much every class. Hunt in the 
          newbie area closest to you. Find the quests tailored for your level 
          and do them as much as you can. Bone chip quests, for instance, are 
          great for faction and exp and can be found in most cities' cleric's 
          guild. Check every guild hall that you are accepted in for quests - 
          the more you do, the faster you will get through these levels, and with 
          less tedium.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Levels 
          6-10:&nbsp;<br>
          </b>I am a big fan of the Butcherblock Mountains for Dwarf, Elf, and 
          Gnome Warriors. There are usually clerics and Druids around to group 
          with, and enough players to group with. Dwarf Skeletons, Giant Scarabs, 
          Giant Bats, and Emerald Drakes are all great experience at these levels, 
          as are the several goblin camps spread around the zone. Crushbone off 
          of Greater Faydark, while annoying, is also an excellent dungeon, and 
          the CrushBone Orc belts and Legionaire Shoulderpads quests are outstanding 
          for experience, cash and faction. Though frequently ignored, I have 
          found that an enterprising player can organize a group for Orc Camps 
          in the Lesser Faydark as well and gain a great deal of experience there, 
          unhindered by other groups.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          most common place for Dark Elves and Humans from Freeport to persue 
          these levels are the Western Commonlands. This zone is very noisy, and 
          has a high density of players, but if you are industrious, you can get 
          through your levels quickly here. Bears, Snakes, and Orcs are the common 
          targets, and groups are fairly easy to get into or form here. Non evil 
          characters can do very well in Misty Thicket, as well. There are always 
          a ton of druids here, and if you can convince one to partner with you, 
          the result can be very productive.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Everfrost, 
          however, will probably always be my favorite place for the early levels. 
          It can support a character from level one to level 25 in theory, and 
          best of all it has a feel completely different from other zones. The 
          people here, on my server at least, always seem to be more friendly. 
          It should be noted, however, that there are Barbarian guards at the 
          exits of Mountain valleys to the Tundra - so evil races would not have 
          an easy time of it here.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
          other viable hunting grounds at these levels would be the Feerrott, 
          Innothule Swamp, the Southern Desert of Ro, and Befallen. I think that 
          South Ro is the most underutilized of these, but it is a long and dangerous 
          run from a bind spot.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Levels 
          11-15:<br>
          </b>Misty Thicket continues to be good hunting right up to level 14 
          or 15. You can still hunt in Butcherblock, as well, but the experience 
          gain will proceed more slowly for most. I found that Lesser Fay and 
          Steamfont were outstanding, but the most common place to find people 
          leveling for these levels is North Ro. All races can hunt here with 
          equal risks. Evil and good races alike can bind in West Freeport, away 
          from the guards without much trouble. Finding a group at these levels 
          isn't usually too difficult, either.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          yard trash in Unrest also makes great prey at this level range. The 
          trains are bad, and pathing is strange here, meaning that you can be 
          run over by mobs significantly tougher than you without much warning, 
          but I have not had too much trouble hunting here when I kept off the 
          main thoroughfare.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Crushbone 
          Castle remains good hunting at these levels as well. Slavers and Legionaires 
          are fairly plentiful, and the quest still provides great experience 
          up to about level 14.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
          are bandits in the Karanas that are about synonymous with Dervs. These 
          bandits drop red sashes that can be turned in for a quest in Qeynos. 
          The rewards are bronze weapons, outstanding faction increases, and a 
          not insignificant amount of cash. This is probably my favorite hunting 
          spot for this level, but it should be pointed out that pickup groups 
          are not at all easy to find at this level. If you want to venture out 
          on these dangerous plains to hunt these bandits, bring some friends 
          with you - you won't find many peers out there.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
          are orc camps that people frequently miss in Lake Rathe and also in 
          Dagnor's Cauldron. These aren't the most convenient spots for people 
          in this level range, but I could see them being great experience for 
          the right team.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Levels 
          16-20:</b>&nbsp;<br>
          Hands down, the most popular place for people to do these levels, regardless 
          of race/class is Oasis. Its crowded, but usually underutilized. The 
          coastline is usually the safest place to be, and hence it is where most 
          people hunt. There are crocodiles here, and they are often killed as 
          fast as they spawn. Deeper in there are countless orcs, however, that 
          are usually not hunted as heavily. A well organized group can hunt these 
          by pulling them to a safer location, and the experience really flows 
          here.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">South 
          Karana starts to become an interesting zone around level 16, also. While 
          I personally cannot stand this zone, and it really seems to have been 
          designed with Druids in mind (read: an abundance of kiters) there are 
          a lot of things to hunt, and spread out over a great deal of space. 
          I have heard of many people staying in this zone without ever leaving 
          all the way up their mid thirties, and with the introduction of an upgraded 
          dungeon, I suppose it could be possible to stay even longer now - but 
          I don't recommend it. Get out and see the world! Adventure is what the 
          game is all about.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          Rathe Mountains, while rarely hunted by people as low as this range, 
          do have several mobs that spawn away from the Hill Giants and Cyclopses 
          that provide good experience. These are Drakes, and if you can organize 
          a party ahead of time you can hunt undisturbed here.&nbsp;</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">High 
          Hold Pass is also a popular hunting ground at these levels, and the 
          orcs and gnolls spawn quickly. When hunting here, you are providing 
          a service to lower level travelers, too, as this is one of the only 
          ways to get from west to east on the continent of Antonica.</font></p>
