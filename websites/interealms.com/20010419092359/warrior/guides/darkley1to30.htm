          Mountains.&nbsp; Here I fought&nbsp; Skunks, and Spiders, and Large 
          Snakes for the first few levels.&nbsp; Making sure I conned everything 
          before I attacked.&nbsp; At level 7 I started killing the Dwarf Skeletons, 
          and anything that conned blue to me.&nbsp; At level 8 I then&nbsp; moved 
          to the Goblin camps and killed the 'a goblins'&nbsp; and would continue 
          to run around killing blue snakes and&nbsp;skeletons.&nbsp; Once I got 
          to 9 I could killing shamans and&nbsp;wizards I killed those and skeletons

          Yellow.&nbsp; Killed those and&nbsp;rogue clockworks and harpies to 
          about 11.&nbsp; Then I&nbsp;started throwing in slavers and Earth Elementals. 
          Did this for about 4 levels till I could get no more expierence.</font>

          Level 14 I move out to the Nybright Sister Camp in Lesser Faydark.&nbsp; 
          This place was great for experience and loot.&nbsp; I killed the sisters 
          for 1 level to 15 went fairly fast.&nbsp;Then I moved to the 'a bandit' 
          camp not to far from the sister camp. These bandits were much hard but 
          with the same nice loot.&nbsp; I killed these to level 16 when exp <br>
          started to slow down.<br>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">From 
          level 16 to 22 I hunted in Dagnors Cauldron. I hunted the Aqua Goblins.&nbsp; 
          There are 4 types of Aqua Goblins in this zone and they vary in difficulty.&nbsp; 
          I started with Aqua Goblin Mariners.&nbsp; They are the easiest and 
          good exp at level 16 and not to difficult.&nbsp; Around 17 or <br>
          18 I moved on to Aqua Goblin Shamans. These ones are a bit more difficult 
          and cast spells.&nbsp; Level 19 I started to throw in Aqua Goblin Bosuns.&nbsp; 
          These guys are tougher and hit pretty hard, i fought these to about 
          level 20.&nbsp;&nbsp; Level 20 I started to try the ocassional Tidal 
          Lord.&nbsp; <br>
          These guys are really tough and hit extremely hard. for most of this 
          hunting I was grouped with a druid the same level)</font>

          22 I moved to Mistmoore, here I started grouping&nbsp; with people my 
          level all the way to level 30.&nbsp; At around level 26/27 you can start 
          to solo stuff pretty easy here in the courtyard.&nbsp; Get some buffs 
          and make sure you always use bind wound thru your previous levels you 
          will need it.</font>
