<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The quest for the <a href="http://db.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20602">Key to Veeshan's Peak</a> is
    a long collection quest based entirely in Kunark.&nbsp; As the name 
indicates, the key that is your final reward will grant you access to the zone
    Veeshan's Peak, which is entered from Skyfire Mountains. You must gather
together three medallions and a tooth off of the undead dragon Trakanon. Each
    medallion, however, is broken into three pieces which you must gather together
    and turn in to different people to get each whole medallion. Two of those
    pieces, in turn, can only be acquired by completing other quests. You
will be doing a tremendous amount of camping very rare critters. You will 
also be delving into dungeons that will be very challenging solo even for a well
    equipped 65. And of course, most folks will need at least a small raid to
    tackle the dragon Trakanon.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Veeshan's Peak
    itself features a variety of dragons and related creatures
ranging in level from 60 to 65.&nbsp; Soloing here is a challenge, to say the 
least, even for a shaman.&nbsp; Therefore, given the difficulty of some steps in 
the quest for the key, I do not recommend starting this quest until you are at 
least level 50 with several groups of help or level 60 with a group of help.&nbsp; 
You will also want to know some other people who have keys or who are working on 
the quest with you, so that you have someone to hunt with once you have that 
key.&nbsp; Also, if you don't already have them, I strongly recommend the <a href="http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/">EQ Toolbox Maps</a> for use with the Legacy of Ykesha expansion in-game map tool.</font></p>

  and cast identify on yourself (or while someone else casts identify on you) you 
  will get a message telling you which medallion it is for and whether it is top, 
  middle, or bottom. As always, you can gather the quest items before talking to 
  the quest givers if you wish to save yourself the extra trip. Given the

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Emperor Ganak says 'You wish to know of Veeshan's Peak?! You are either very brave or very foolish! There is 
nothing there for the uninvited but a fiery death. I have been away from this 
plane of existence for a long time, yet, still, I feel the presence of the 
ancient wurms. I am sure they sense my presence as well, since I hold the only 
[key to the chambers] of the Ring of Scale.'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say, 'What key to the chambers?'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Emperor Ganak says 'I am not so quick to grant someone the 
key to their death! If you truly wish your doom to fall upon you so soon, 
bring me the three medallions of the fallen Iksar tribes, Kylong, Obulus, and 
Jarsath. The tribes were crushed long ago by the warriors of the Kunzar and 
their remains lie buried beneath the rubble of ages. Finding the lost 
medallions of my people will not be enough to prove you worthy of entry into 
the fortress of the great wurms. There is another task you must complete 
before you return the medallions.'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say, 'What medallions?'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Emperor Ganak says 'There were five different tribes of my people. The Kunzar, 
Kylong, Nathsar, Obulus, and Jarsath. Each of the tribes had a medallion that 
represented it. If you can return to me the medallions of the Kunzar and 
Nathsar, I will give you the idol of Trakanon.'</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That bit about the medallions of the Kunzar and Nathsar and the idol of Trakanon is the quest for the key to Sebilis, if you haven't done that already.</font></p>

the Ring of Scale become nothing more than a snack for the wurms who dwell in 
its halls. Once you cross the threshold of the peak, there is no escape. Any 
fool dedicated enough to locate the medallions can do so, but it takes a truly 
mighty individual to slay the dragon who has plagued my people for ages. I speak 
of the poison dragon, Trakanon, the vile undead wurm who conquered my people's 
greatest wurmslayers. Bring me proof of Trakanon's death with the medallions I 
request and I may deem you worthy of the key to the Ring of Scale.'</font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Xiblin Fizzlebik says 'Hello, Verdandi! I am Xiblin Fizzlebik, renowned 
archeologist and historian of Ak'Anon. I'm currently in search of artifacts and 
relics on the Iksar [Jarsath tribe]. If you stumble upon anything, please bring 
it to me.'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say, 'Who were the Jarsath tribe?'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Xiblin Fizzlebik says 'About two thousand years ago, there were five 
different tribes of Iksar who dwelled on the continent of Kunark. One of these 
tribes was the Jarsath. They were a very primitive sort, proud and tribal, but 
also cannibalistic. Often, they went to war with the other tribes that 
co-existed with them, back then. The ruins found on this island were of 
structures created by the Jarsath. I've been excavating for quite some time now, 
but haven't been able to find anything of significance.'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say, 'What are you looking for?'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Xiblin Fizzlebik says 'In my studies, I have learned that the Jarsath 
believed they could draw power from a holy symbol, specifically, a medallion 
that represented their tribe. When Salthir became king of the Iksar empire, 
Sebilis, he had the medallion broken into three pieces and hid them on the 
Kunark continent so that they would never be found. I'm searching for the pieces 
so that I can put it back together and learn more about this tribe. Perhaps you 
wish to help?'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say, 'I wish to help'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Xiblin Fizzlebik says 'All I know is that the pieces were most likely hidden 
in watery regions. If you manage to find them, bring them to me and I will be 
able to put the medallion of the Jarsath back together. I am sure there is much 
to be learned from it.'</font></p>

</blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Top piece</i>:  Easy as can be. Go to the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/swampofnohopemap.html">Swamp of No Hope</a>. It's pretty safe but 
you'll be getting kind of close to Cabilis so you may wish to have invis up just 
in case you stray too much. You want to go to +50, +2930, in the middle of 
the western edge of the zone. The ground spawn looks like the ubiquitous little 
brown baggie. It is at the base of the slope at the edge of the zone, close to 
the water.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Middle piece</i>: A real pain, especially without a tracker. The ancient 
Jarsath is a Kunark skeleton that wanders <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/firionaviemap.html">Firiona Vie</a>. In particular, it seems 
to spawn in and wander around the area just south and west of the drolvarg fortress 
at number 5 on the EQ Atlas map. I spent hours standing at the fortress and sending my pet to kill anything and 
everything on the slope and the plain beyond, focusing on non-drolvargs, before 
the bugger finally appeared. A tracker will help for the obvious reasons, 
although someone with sense undead is a good second choice. There are 
absolutely no other undead npcs in the zone, and sense undead works across the 
entire zone. Thus, even a low level cleric, paladin, shadowknight, or 
necromancer standing somewhere safe could cast the spell periodically to scan 
for the presence of the Jarsath and give a very rough idea where it is. I can't 
say for sure whether it really does have a placeholder or just has a long 
respawn timer. One report on <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4226">Illia's Bestiary</a> offers
the following: "He walked from 518, neg 1717 to 1500, neg 1880. He stopped here a moment, then 
turned back around and headed to neg 967, 1628. Then of course I got attacked by 
a drolvarg...". I cannot verify that but you may wish to locate those locs and
lurk around them. Once you get the little bugger he is approximately
level 40-45.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Bottom piece</i>: Take your dramamine. You need to kill the bloodgill 
marauder in the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/lakeofillomen.html">Lake of Ill Omen</a>, right outside the entrance to Veksar at the 
bottom of the lake, on the western side of the underwater building. Yes, this is 
an underwater camp. He does not seem to have placeholders but his respawn time 
is uncertain. Some reports say an hour or two, while others say as many as eight. The usual method of getting him before Veksar was to 
stop by as often as possible, every few hours or so, and check for him. Now with 
the traffic heading in and out of Veksar, you will probably 
need to camp the entrance. There are four goblins that spawn right around there 
that will probably agro. If you are doing this in your 50s you may want a friend 
or two and might be able to get decent exp by pulling other goblins in the area.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Go back to Xiblin Fizzlebik and give him the three Pieces of Medallion.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Akabao says 'There were five tribes of Iksar who rose from the

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Akabao says 'The Kylong were a mountain-dwelling tribe of Iksar who 
sought esoteric knowledge. They had vast libraries of ancient magical tomes 
acquired from Shissar sorcerers, and strove to understand and implement the 
rituals documented therein. When the Kunzar armies marched upon the Kylong, the 
three greatest Kylong mystics shattered the medallion of Kylong, a holy relic of 
their tribe, and fled their mountain homes in order to prevent the Kunzar from 
reassembling it.'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Akabao says 'I have been attempting to learn the destinations of 
the three Kylong leaders who held the fragments of the medallion. I know only 
that they sought shelter in which to hide and continue the practice of their 
mystical arts hoping to one day return their tribe to its former glory. Their 
remains may exist beneath some of the fortresses that are centers of Iksar and 
sarnak necromancy. I have seen indications that some of the tomes in those 
fortresses are, in fact, the very tomes once cherished by the Kylong. Should you 
manage to recover the broken pieces of the medallion of Kylong, bring them to me 
so I may restore the ancient artifact.'</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Top piece</i>: If you are not kos to Chardok you can stroll on in and do this without a single fight.  If you know someone who is not kos to Chardok, they can go in and agro the npc you need and bring him up to the zone entrance so you can deal with him.  Otherwise, bring help. You must journey deep into 
  Chardok to the ratman Niblek, who will trade you the piece you need in exchange 
  for a black sapphire and a ruby. Rubies are sold on vendors all over the place. 
  Black sapphires drop off of various high level critters all over Norrath. The 
  Bazaar may be as easy as anything else. Niblek does not despawn when you complete 
  this step, so be sure to advise your helpers to bring those gems to complete 
  this part for themselves as well. A few 60s or a couple strong groups of low 
  to mid-50s should be able to handle this. You can attempt to sneak down here 
  while invis, but the lizard wolves see invis so this would be very dangerous 
  to anyone but a rogue with their super sneaky AA. There isn't much in the way 
  of good maps available, so here are directions. From the entrance to the zone, 
  proceed down the tunnel and hug the left wall past the fortress and up the exit ramp 
  10 feet or so. Turn around and look back down towards the fortress and you will 
  see an opening in the wall on the left up in the air alongside the ramp. Put 
  up levitate and run into it. Proceed down the tunnel. At the first fork go right, 
  at the second fork go left, at the third fork go right, at the fourth fork go 
  right and follow the right wall. Niblek is tucked into a little alcove on the 
  right. There can be some good drops along the way including some rare Kunark 
  spells, which might help you entice some help. Give him your gems to receive 
  your piece of the medallion.</font></p>

Verix's Remains is in the rooms marked #1 in the catacombs at that EQ Atlas map.
Probably the easiest way to get in is to enter from the underwater passage in
the moat to the south. You will encounter several critters between there and
the
rooms, and then the #1 rooms themselves have at least 7 or 8 spawns to clear.
Remember that most of Karnor's sees invis, not just the undead. Once in the #1
rooms it will be all undead, some of them with some modestly nice drops. Verix's
Remains placeholder is the spawn in the northeast corner of the eastern
#1 room. The respawn for these rooms is somewhere between 20-30 minutes. You
may be here for many, many, many hours before you actually get the Remains. Only
the best soloers should tackle this alone, due to the sheer volume
of critters and relatively cramped quarters; a duo of 60+ would probably do 
fine. If you are in your low to mid 50s you will probably want a strong 
group or two.&nbsp; Verix's Remains is level 51 and a shadowknight, so watch

your hit points on the pull.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Bottom piece</i>: An easy bit, if you're good at being sneaky. This ground 
  spawn is on the upper floor of the library in <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/kaesora1map.html">Kaesora</a>, 
  at number 5 on that map. If you don't wish to fight, you'll need invis to get 
  through the entrance areas and invis to undead for the rest. There are undead 
  roamers near the entrance, however, and some of the spiders see invis, so it's 
  still not entirely safe. Even so, none of this should be a real danger unless 
  you get mobbed. Kaesora can be confusing, even with a map, so here are 
  directions. From the entrance put up your invis and take the first left turn. 
  Drop down to the bottom of the pit and turn to the right at the intersection. 
  The room ahead has the spiders that might see invis. Cross the room and go through 
  the opposite door, to the south. In the near, left corner of that room is the hidden
  passage to the undead area. Walk through the wall into it and move a safe distance from the spiders. Put up 
  invis to undead. Proceed down that long, winding hallway. At the bottom it will 
  open up to a big room with the library the first building on the left. Go up 
  the stairs and through the doorway and take the passage to the right. Pass the big main room to the rear of the building, where 
  you will find the stairs to the upper walkway. The medallion will be another 
  brown baggie on the ground around the far side of the walkway, almost at the 
  end. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Top piece</i>: Not too tough. This is the other sub-quest, involving the iksar Ssolet 
Dnaas in <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/warslikswoods.html">Warslik's Woods</a>. 
You need to bring him a Burnished Wooden Stave, a random drop off of sarnaks in 
Chardok. It is an uncommon drop but comes off of any sarnak, including 
those near the zone. You may be able to find one in the Bazaar, as well; they 
are not No Drop. Ssolet himself appears to be on the Crusaders of Greenmist 
faction, the Cabilis shadowknights. If you are not an iksar and have not 
worked on your Cabilis factions, he will be kos. In that case you will need to 
bring someone to charm him. (Sneaking will also work according to the 
usual rules for classes with that ability.) Contrary to some reports, he is <b>not</b> 
permarooted and will come charging if agroed. The enchanter who came to charm 
him for me will testify to that. He is on a tiny island at +4000, +400 at the 
north end of the zone. Once charmed, hand him your stave to 
receive the piece of the medallion.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Middle piece</i>: Bring a book. A really long book. This piece drops off of the rotting skeleton at +2250, -5150 in <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/dreadlandsmap.html">Dreadlands</a>. 
There is a single spawn placeholder there that does not wander. The rotting 
skeleton is an extremely, excruciatingly rare spawn. I spent 15+ hours here, a 
number that does not seem especially atypical. The placeholders are all low-ish 
level skeletons that should be readily soloable to a level 50. However, their 
levels vary enough that bringing a lower level alt to kill them might not be 
worth the trouble. The rotting skeleton himself is level 45. The respawn is 
approximately 7 minutes. I sat myself up on 
the hill where I could see the spawn point and just sent my pet after each 
spawn. Very rarely a drolvarg would appear to walk by, but I am not sure if it 
was ghosting. I was never agroed at my spot on the hill, maybe 25 feet 
from the spawn point, in spite of a few prolonged mental health breaks.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Bottom piece</i>: Don't put that book away. If you finished it already, get another. Then head to <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/trakanonsteethmap.html">Trakanon's Teeth</a> 
to the ruins marked 7 on that map. Your target is the pained soul, another very 
rare spawn at a static camp near the entrance to Old Sebilis. I was relatively 
lucky with this one, just four hours, but it can be every bit as ugly as the 
rotting skeleton. His exact spawn point is at -1840, -4370, in a building right 
along the edge of the ruins. As long as you stay inside his building nothing 
else should agro. His respawn is about 7 minutes. The pained soul and his 
placeholders are all undead. His placeholders run at low health and will agro 
other ghosts in the ruins, so be careful not to let them run too far. I was able 
to hold this camp with ease at level 63 but my pet needed help. If you are much 
under 60 you might want help, if nothing else because the pained soul himself is 
in his mid to high 40s. With the amount of time you might spend waiting on him, 
it would be utterly tragic for him to beat you.</font></p>

death. I need this not. It is useless to me. Here, you take it. Maybe you can

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Trakanon's Tooth</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The final piece of the key is the tooth of the undead dragon Trakanon, deep 
in Old Sebilis. I am sure that a single group of sufficiently equipped and 
talented folks could take him. However, more likely you're going to want 
three or four groups, maybe more if your help is new to raiding or mostly in 
their 50s. Only the tooth that drops off of Trakanon himself will work. 
Similarly named items that drop in other places, such as the Trakasaur's Tooth 
that drops in the zone Trakanon's Teeth, will not work. Trakanon himself is 
level 66 and found in the second level of
    <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/sebilis.html">Sebilis</a> in the room 
marked 4 on that map. Depending on your server, just catching Trakanon up may be more of a challenge than killing him.</font></p>

  place shall be prepared for your souls among the most honored of the dead.
