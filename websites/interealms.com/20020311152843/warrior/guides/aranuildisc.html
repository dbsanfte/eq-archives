This is my write-up on warrior disciplines. When to use them, why to use them, which ones will make you a better player, and which ones will make you look foolish. I have taken the liberty of the acquiring the basic descriptions of the Disciplines from http://eq.castersrealm.com. I have added comments for each one. I hope you find this valuable.<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Comments:<BR></B>
<i>This is a great discipline for caster type mobs throughout the low 40s and 50s in places like Sol B, and Lower Guk. This is an excellent discipline for Nagafen and Vox raids from level 48-52, but it is no substitute for resist gear.</I><BR><BR><BR> 


<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF FEARLESS</B><BR> 
Level obtained: 40<BR> 
Duration: 11 seconds.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay: 60 minutes.<BR>

This discipline lasts for 11 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour.<BR> 
The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you level.<BR><BR> 

<B>Comments:</B><BR> 
<i>I never used this discipline, and I likely never will. Discipline Resistant is a far better choice in most instances when you would consider using this because it raises all of your resistances. Additionally, the duration and re-use delay make this discipline worthless.</I><BR><BR><BR> 


<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF EVASIVE</B><BR> 
Level obtained: 52<BR> 
Duration: 3 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay: 15 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 7 minutes.<BR> 
Discipline Description:<BR> 
The warrior is hit by his opponent less often but also will hit his target less often. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR><BR> 

<B>Comments:</B><BR> 
<i>This is our first class-specific discipline. It is very similar to Discipline Defensive, in that you take less damage, and do less damage. However with Evasive you are doing FAR less damage. Unofficially, I have heard rumor that you take 30% less damage and do 45% less damage. If I am able to find out the exact percentages, I will provide them.<BR><BR> 

This discipline is best used when you need to train to a zone, or if you are stuck at the zone in to Sebilis, and need to get to the zone out when there is a full pop. I don't recommend using this during combat, especially when you are the primary tank, because you will be doing far less damage, and it will be difficult to hold aggro.</i><BR><BR><BR> 


<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF CHARGE</B><BR> 
Level obtained: 53<BR> 
Duration: 14 seconds.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay: 30 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 23 minutes.<BR> 
Discipline Description:<BR> 
When using this discipline the warrior will automatically land all attacks against his opponent. In other words he will not miss. This discipline lasts for 14 seconds and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR><BR> 

<B>Comments: </B><BR>
<i>This is our first good discipline. Landing all of your blows is a great thing for burning down a tough mob. Best results are achieved when you are in a berserker frenzy, because you will be slightly hasted, have raised strength, and have the chance for a crippling blow or two. It is not critical that you be berserked for this, as it is effective all the time. I would also highly recommend dual wielding when using this discipline.<BR><BR> 

Landing all of your blows can be a great thing, and the re-use time, while not ideal is palatable. I use disciplines for situations where things are out of my control and I need to get them back into control. You should not be popping this one every time it is available, but rather using it for that bad pull you made, or the add you got that you did not expect. It is my opinion that this discipline is our most useful discipline until 55 when we get defensive.</I><BR><BR><BR> 


<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF MIGHTY STRIKE</B><BR> 
Level obtained: 54<BR> 
Duration: 10 seconds.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay: 60 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 54 minutes.<BR> 
Discipline Description:<BR> 
When using this discipline all landed attacks will automatically be either Critical Hits or Crippling Blows. This discipline lasts for 10 seconds and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR><BR> 

<B>Comments:</B><BR> 
<i>This disciplines duration and re-use time make it highly undesirable for all but the most specific scenarios. This is the most overused discipline that warriors get. This discipline should ONLY be used when you are in a berserker frenzy.<BR><BR> 

Many young warriors get this discipline and are impressed by the big numbers they see in terms of damage when it is used, and use it far too often. The key here is the re-use time. You have an hour before you can use it again for a TEN second discipline. If you are past level 55, and are the primary tank in your group, you should NEVER be using this EVER. You cannot predict when you might need to pop defensive, and if you recently used Mighty Strike, you will be the reason that your party died.<BR><BR> 

If you are above 55 and not the primary tank I still caution you against using this discipline, because you never know when your primary tank might die, or be low on health with a cleric with low mana. If you can taunt off of him, and tank for a bit, especially with defensive, you can take some pressure off of the cleric, and help get things back under control.<BR><BR> 

I believe that there are only three uses for this discipline. The first two are good uses of it, and the third is the root of the problem with Discipline Mighty Strike.<BR><BR> 

First, when you are in a duel, this is a great discipline to use when you are berserked in a duel, and your opponent is snared or has some other form of movement slowing on them. Remember that it is only 10 seconds, so if your opponent moves away, you just wasted your discipline.<BR><BR> 

Second, when you have an unstunnable, unrootable, unsnarable mob, like the Grand Huntsman in Icewell keep. If you are killing him, and he gets to the point where he is going to run, popping Might Strike is a good way to prevent him from making it to the throne room, where he will aggro the royal guard, and they will subsequently kill you<BR><BR> 

The third, and by far most common use of Mighty Strike is the proud warrior that wants to show off some impressive numbers. No one can deny that Mighty Strike is excellent for this purpose and definitely, if you are a backup tank, or maybe on an overpowered Hate or Fear raid, it can be fun. The only problem with this, is that before you hit that hotkey, or before you type /disci Might, a lot of warriors don't take into account what they will be doing for the next hour. There is nothing worse than pressing your /disci defensive hotkey, and finding out you have to wait to use it because you recently used Mighty. Showing off can be fun, but not at the cost of performance.<BR><BR><BR></I> 


<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF DEFENSIVE</B><BR> 
Level obtained: 55<BR> 
Duration: 3 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay: 15 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 10 minutes.<BR> 
Discipline Description:<BR> 
The warrior takes less melee damage but also deals less. This will not reduce damage taken by the warrior from any form of magic, damage shield, or weapon proc. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes and has a base reuse time of 15 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR><BR> 

<B>Comments:</B><BR> 
<i>This is by far our best discipline. If you are the primary tank in an experience group, and you are above level 55, this is the only discipline you should be using. The duration (3 minutes!) and the refresh time (15 minutes, but by the time the discipline is done, it is really only 12 minutes!) makes this very useable. This discipline can be used in a long battle against an ubermob, in an experience group when your cleric is low on mana, and needs to meditate. With defensive, you can extend the amount of time between heals thus giving your cleric more time to med. It can also be used when you are afraid that a Complete Heal or other heal will not get to you in time, or when training to the zone from a bad pull/etc. With defensive you take 45% less damage, and do 30% less.<BR><BR> 

I once made it from the Ramp down in Dragon Necropolis to the zoneline with no SoW using /defensive.<BR><BR>  

Why is defensive our best discipline? There is a common misconception amongst warriors that we are there to do damage. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a warrior, your job is NOT to do damage. That is the job of Rogues, Monks, and Rangers. A warriors job is to take damage and hold aggro. Period. Warriors are the most mana efficient class for a cleric to heal. Discipline Defensive is a tool that allows us to do our job better! I have never personally had a problem holding Aggro while defensive is up. It is important to make a hotkey that tells others not to taunt when defensive is up. If you pop defensive, and someone else tanks, you just wasted your disci. At least with defensive if it is wasted, you only have to wait 12 minutes.<BR><BR><BR></i> 


<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF FURIOUS</B><BR> 
Level obtained: 56<BR> 
Duration: 9 seconds.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay: 60 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 56 minutes.<BR> 
Discipline Description:<BR> 
When using this discipline the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on them by the opponent they are facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR><BR> 

<B>Comments:</B><BR> 
<i>Try as I might, I cannot think of a scenario where I would use this discipline over any other. The re-use delay, and duration make it highly undesirable to start, and the effect is questionable at best. Add in the fact that most Ubermobs have disciplines of their own that essentially negate this, and Discipline Furious goes on the shelf for the far better Discipline Defensive. If you were to use this, you would want to be the primary tank.<BR><BR><BR></i> 


<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF PRECISION</B><BR> 
Level obtained: 57<BR> 
Duration: 3 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay: 30 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 27 minutes.<BR> 
Discipline Description:<BR> 
The warrior will have a greater chance to hit his target but will also have a greater chance of being hit. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR><BR> 

<B>Comments:</B><BR> 
<i>Disci precision is currently my second favorite discipline. This discipline is best used when you are a backup tank for a GOOD primary tank who is holding aggro well, and you come up against a mob with a great deal of hitpoints like Trantor in WW, The Broodmaster in Velks Lab, or The Enraged Golem in Fear. For 3 minutes, you will raise your damage output, considerably, while not raising your aggro too bad. The re-use time though on the high side is workable, and can really be a boon to a group if used correctly. If you find yourself aggroed, make sure you turn off attack, and wait until the primary tank regains aggro.<BR><BR> 

I was involved in killing the Broodmaster in Velketor's Laboratory in a group of five with only Larain, Cshae, Burien, Droo, and myself. When we engaged, Larain popped Defensive, I allowed him to build some aggro, then I popped Evasive. It worked out very well.<BR><BR>  

This discipline should NEVER be used when you are the primary tank. You will take considerably more damage, waste your clerics mana, and possibly die.</i><BR><BR><BR> 


<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF FELL STRIKE</B><BR> 
Level obtained: 58<BR> 
Duration: 12 seconds.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay: 30 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 28 minutes.<BR> 
Discipline Description:<BR> 
When using this discipline all hits landed by the warrior will be for at least four times the base weapons damage. For example: If you used a Short Sword of the Ykesha with a base damage of 8, then you would receive a bonus of 32 damage on every hit for the duration of the discipline. This discipline lasts for 12 seconds and has a base reuse time of 30 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR><BR> 

<B>Comments:</B><BR> 
<I>This discipline is not a bad one, but for offensive disciplines, I favor precision for it's extended duration. The reuse time here is very workable, and you do very good damage. This can be a good disci when you are NOT the primary tank and want to do a bit more damage, but only for a shorter time.<BR><BR><BR></I> 


<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF FORTITUDE</B><BR> 
Level obtained: 59<BR> 
Duration: 8 seconds.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay: 60 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 59 minutes.<BR> 
Discipline Description:<BR> 
When using this discipline the warrior cannot be hit in melee combat. This does not alter in anyway the ability for the warrior to have damage inflicted on them by magical means. This discipline lasts for 8 seconds and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<BR><BR> 

<B>Comments:</B><BR> 
<I>Though I have not gotten or personally tested this discipline yet, looking at the re-use delay, and duration, I would be inclined to say that defensive is a better way to go. Additionally, I remember hearing a fellow warrior that was trying to make it to a zone using this discipline complain that it did not work as advertised. This discipline gets a preliminary thumbs down.</I><BR><BR><BR> 


<B>THE DISCIPLINE OF AGGRESSIVE</B><BR> 
Level obtained: 60<BR> 
Duration: 3 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay: 27 minutes.<BR> 
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 27 minutes.<BR> 
Discipline Description:<BR> 
The warrior will do more damage with every blow landed but will also take more damage as well. This discipline lasts for 3 minutes and has a base reuse time of 27 minutes.<BR><BR> 

<B>Comments:</B><BR> 
<i>This discipline looks like it could work as an upgrade to Precision. Again, this should be used when you are not the main tank, and the main tank is holding aggro well. I would have to test it to see which works better. This looks promising, and the level 60 warriors that I spoke to about this gave me favorable comments.</I><BR><BR><BR> 

Hopefully this was helpful, and perhaps it clarified some misconceptions about the various disciplines. If anyone has any questions/comments/corrections, please feel free to E-mail me at wirespeed@hotmail.com. My plan is to incorporate all of these into an extremely comprehensive warrior guide, so all help is appreciated. Thanks for reading.<BR><BR> 

Humbly,<BR><BR><BR>
