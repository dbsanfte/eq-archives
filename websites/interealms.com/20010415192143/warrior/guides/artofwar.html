        <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Fellow 
          travelers of Norrath, hail and well met!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Long 
          and hard do we quest the lands of our world, searching out adventure, 
          treasure, and fame. Though glory is what we seek, the most important 
          of tasks are often not glorious in the least. With that thought in mind 
          I present to you the Warrior: simple, strong, a master of a select few 
          disciplines; always the first in, and usually the one that never comes 
          out. However, it is this staple occupation that can provide victory 
          or ruin to a campaigning party.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;My 
          objective with this guide is not to provide a be-all-end-all path towards 
          becoming a lean mean fighting machine. I will not discuss strategies 
          on how to level quicker, what monsters to fight, what race to choose 
          in creating a warrior, or what statistics are most important. If this 
          information is what you seek, there are plenty of other guides out there 
          that deal with these subjects.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;My 
          humble goal is to simply share some of the observations and conclusions 
          that I have stumbled over in my year or so of playing this wonderful 
          class. Almost all of the suggestions that I will make are to improve 
          the skills of the &quot;player&quot;, not the numeric &quot;stats&quot; 
          of the character. (An obvious exception being when I discuss equipment 
          choices). Another trend that the reader may notice is that I almost 
          exclusively refer to the Warrior as being in a group. This is because 
          I feel that this is exactly where a Warrior should be. Warriors do not 
          solo past the newbie levels (which I deem as around 1-7, in which there 
          really is no differentiation between the classes). Once the specific 
          traits of each class start to become apparent, it is time for the Warrior 
          to settle into his role in the group. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Thus 
          the Warrior’s role in said group is essentially divided into three sections: 
          Pulling, dealing meelee damage, and taking any damage. So, I divide 
          this writing as such, with an additional beginning section on setting 
          up the User Interface to give the Warrior an added edge. That being 
          said, let’s begin!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The 
          User Interface:</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Most 
          people take the interface for granted, accepting what is given to them, 
          occasionally changing one or two key mappings for ease of use. However, 
          how you set up your access to the various abilities you own can drastically 
          effect your prowess in battle. In my two years of exploring Norrath 
          I have divised a keyboard layout that allows me to keep my eyes on the 
          battle, with every key accessible from one position on the keyboard.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;First 
          of all: the Auto Attack button. Everyone (I can’t stress this enough) 
          should remap this button. Every time you see a newbie corpse laying 
          on the ground in front of a guard, you can pretty much be assured that 
          they went to talk to the guard but didn’t hit the &lt;enter&gt; key 
          first. Soon as they pressed that &lt;A&gt; they attacked that guard, 
          and guards don’t like that. Which key do you use? Well, that’s really 
          up to you. My strategy for remapping my keys was to arrange them as 
          close to the directional arrows as much as possible. When using a mouse 
          with the right hand, the left hand as almost always at those arrows, 
          for walking forward, backward, and sidestepping (when the right mouse 
          button is held down). I chose to remap the Auto Attack to &lt;Numpad 
          0/INS&gt;. Keeping my middle finger to hit the forward and back arrows, 
          I can trigger my attack by simply using my first finger to hit the key. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Next 
          are the user assignable hotbuttons. Once I realized the value of having 
          the Auto Attack so close the the directional arrows, these became self-evident. 
          I remapped my six hotbuttons from the keys &lt;1&gt; - &lt;6&gt; to 
          &lt;Numpad 1&gt; - &lt;Numpad 6&gt;. So, again, everything I need is 
          within easy reach of a finger while I am at the directional keys. When 
          Verant added four more buttons to each bank, I just added &lt;Numpad 
          7&gt; - &lt;Numpad 9&gt; as well as the &lt;foreslash&gt; key that sits 
          at the top of the number pad. To switch from bank to bank is a simple 
          task of holding the right &lt;shift&gt; key with my pinkie and hitting 
          the number on the number pad of the bank I want.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;While 
          this may seem obvious and trivial, the end result is that my right hand 
          is always on my mouse, my eyes are always on the screen, and I never 
          have to search for a key during combat.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Now, 
          I would like to share with you how I have set up my hotbutton banks. 
          I have three banks total: One simply for combat, one for general utilities, 
          and then one for personal management. I’ll show you each and describe 
          the buttons.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;That’s 
          essentially it for my setup. I hope that this has helped you see the 
          benefits to be gained by customizing your controls. Now, let’s move 
          on to some actual tactics in battle....<b> </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>&quot;Come 
          Hither Yon Beastie!&quot; (a.k.a. Pulling)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Until 
          your Warrior reaches the mid-high levels, you will find yourself often 
          nominated for the task of running out there, kicking some evil-nasty 
          in the shins, and bringing him back to the rest of the group to finish 
          off. This makes sense: You have the most hitpoints and, unless you have 
          been neglecting to equip yourself properly, the highest Armor Class. 
          In short, you stand the best chance of making it back alive. As I said 
          before, this holds true until the innate abilities of some other classes 
          make them a better candidate, such as Monks (the famous Feign Death 
          pull), Rogues (because of their thiefly abilites of sneak, hide, and 
          the anti-taunt), and Rangers (due to their prowess with a bow as well 
          as the ability to snare and track). Also, the Warrior’s pulling efficacy 
          is less noticeable outdoors, where perhaps a speedy Druid or Bard would 
          be better suited to the task.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;So, 
          you mainly have to deal with bringing back creatures through the labyrinthine 
          corridors of Norrath’s many dungeons. This can prove to be a very daunting 
          task, and really the only way to get good at it (I still only consider 
          myself mildy profficient) is to practice, practice, practice. However, 
          I may be able to provide you with some useful tips...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;The 
          very first thing you should do is become familiar with the territory. 
          If you know your way around, that only improves your chances of getting 
          back to the group intact. Every wrong turn means more precious seconds 
          by yourself with a hostile monster at your heels. When you head out 
          from the staging area to pull a mob, try to remember which way you’ve 
          turned, look for landmarks, and try to replicate your path on the way 
          back. When in an unfamiliar place, try only making left turns for the 
          first few pulls (making only right turns on the way back). Then reverse 
          it: right turns out, left turns coming back. Once you are more comfortable, 
          try alternating every turn (first take a left, then a right, the a left, 
          etc.). Try to remember what the last turn was, then do the opposite 
          on the way back. Of course, soon you should be able to simply know where 
          you are by visual recognition, so having to follow your &quot;path of 
          bread crumbs&quot; back should not be an issue after the first few pulls 
          or so.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Now, 
          once you have found your victim, the next thing you should do is let 
          your party know that a mob is incoming (remember: &quot;Life is great 
          when we communicate!&quot;). This gives them time to prepare, and a 
          Cleric can have you targetted and a heal on the way as soon as you arrive.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;You 
          are very likely to take a lot of damage while pulling a mob, especially 
          once you get past the mid levels, where the monsters start getting disproportionally 
          more difficult compared to your level. One way to decrease the amount 
          of damage is to pull with a bow. Any distance you put between yourself 
          and your target when you initiate the encounter gives you a head start, 
          which means fewer smacks in the back of the head. Also, I don’t know 
          if this is true or not, but when pulling with a bow, you seem to bring 
          less surrounding mobs with your target. For example, while pulling from 
          the first room in Infected Paw (where three gnolls spawn), if I went 
          right up to one of them to pull, I invariably brought all three. However, 
          when pulling with a bow from a short distance away, about half the time 
          I only brought two. Again, I haven’t clinically proven this yet, but 
          it seems to be a valid conclusion from my personal experiences.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Another 
          way to put a little distance between you and the mob you are pulling 
          is to jump occasionally as you run. Jumping gives you a short burst 
          of speed, and every blow that is avoided by distance helps. Just remember 
          to ask for that Invigor when you get back to the group, as jumping eats 
          away stamina almost as fast as a hastened Wurmslayer. &#74;</font> </p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Sometimes, 
          as a puller, you are required to make a sacrifice of yourself to save 
          the group. The pathing in some of the dungeons is atrocious, and you 
          will often find yourself bringing far more than your group can handle. 
          In these occasions, it is best to try to run in the opposite direction 
          of your party, towards a zone if at all possible (be sure to shout that 
          Train warning). You will probably die, but if you are far enough away 
          the baddies will return to their spawn points and leave the rest of 
          your group alone. You will be awarded with your comrades admiration, 
          but it also leaves you in a better position to get your corpse back, 
          since there are up to 5 other alive and ready people in a position to 
          help. The worst thing that can happen is for a full group to have to 
          break in to a zone, naked and helpless, to retrieve their corpses, so 
          try to avoid that at all costs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Now 
          that you have brought that monster back to your group, the real fun 
          begins...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff"><b>&quot;It 
          Slices, Dices, and Juliennes...&quot; (or, dealing damage the Warrior 
          way)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;It 
          is a common misconception (usually within the Warrior circles themselves) 
          that Warriors are veritable whirlwinds of death in combat. While we 
          are no slouches in the martial arts, we are difinitely not on top. Strictly 
          talking about meelee, Monks surpass us in raw damage, and Rogues are 
          about on par with the copious amounts of damage done by backstabbing. 
          Throw in the Wizard’s jawdropping direct-damage spells, and a Necromancer’s 
          DoT’s, and we are pushed even farther down the line. This does not mean 
          that we are useless as attackers, far from it (what we do still goes 
          a long way towards dropping that bad guy), because the damage a Warrior 
          does is for a specific purpose... which I’ll get in to later. First 
          off, let’s look at how a Warrior can maximize his/her effectiveness.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;It 
          was once thought that a Warrior should concentrate his or her time and 
          energy into one or two types of weapons (the Ruins of Kunark Official 
          Strategy Guide even supports this). Having learned the hard way, I can 
          attest that this is just plain wrong. We are meant to be masters of 
          weaponry, ALL weaponry, evinced by the fact that we are one of the few 
          classes that can use every weapon skill. Work on each and every skill 
          as you rise through the ranks (yes, even 2-hand blunt, as horrible as 
          it is...). As I said, I learned the hard way. I focused on two-handed 
          slashing, as did many Warriors. After all, when weapons such as the 
          mighty Mithril Two-handed Sword exist, what more could you need? Enter 
          the Wurmslayer: here I am in posession of a one-handed weapon that outpaces 
          many of the two-handers out there, and my skill is just horrible. So, 
          I began the long trek towards advancing the skill. I have finally maxed 
          it for my level, but it was not easy, and in many cases not fun. I have 
          also begun working on every other skill as well. Right now the Wurmslayer 
          is my weapon of choice, but you never know what will be discovered next, 
          and I refuse to be left in the dust again. Just talk to any high level 
          monk who didn’t practice thier blunt skills, and ask them how they felt 
          when Kunark came out... </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;By 
          the way, on the topic of two-handed blunt... This is commonly known 
          as the worst skill to work on, since the weapons are so incredibly slow. 
          However, there is a solution: the Ketchata Koro Mis. It is a two-handed 
          blunt staff that drops in Kunark, and has a delay of 30, making it the 
          second fastest two-handed blunt out there. You can find them everywhere, 
          as they are a common drop. I bought one for 5gp (yes, gold pieces) in 
          Greater Faydark in order to start practicing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Being 
          able to use the latest and greatest weaponry is always nice, however 
          there are more reasons to be able to wield a wide variety of weapons. 
          For example, taunting is much easier when you can dish out damage quickly 
          and consistently, calling for Duel Wielding two swift swords. On the 
          other end of the spectrum, a high damage/high delay weapon is more desireable 
          when dealing with a mob that has a damage shield, since you want to 
          dole out the most damage with the least amount of contacts.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Another 
          &quot;weapon&quot; not be discarded is the humble shield. For smaller 
          races, using a shield is the only way a Warrior can bash an opponent. 
          The stun component of the bash skill is invaluable when dealing with 
          casters, especially those that can heal themselves. Also, bash becomes 
          a (less effective) version of Snare in the absence of a Druid or Ranger, 
          stopping or slowing a running mob from reaching reinforcements.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;In 
          order to speed up the time it takes bring a skill up to max, get a few 
          items to increase your dexterity. The combination of a Grotesque Mask 
          and an Executioner’s Hood adds a total of 16 to dexterity, and (at least 
          on the Innoruuk server) can be bought for less than 200pp for both.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;A 
          final topic I would like to address is the choosing of a proper off-hand 
          weapon. There has been much debate on the subject, and I have tested 
          the many different theories and found which one works best. The central 
          idea to it all is that the two weapons do not act independently. The 
          only time you use your secondary weapon is when a successful &quot;roll&quot; 
          for Duel Wield occurs. The only time that Duel Wield is &quot;rolled&quot; 
          is when you make an attack with your primary weapon. And, of course, 
          the delay on that primary weapon is what determines how often you attack 
          with it. Follow that line of thinking back, and you realize that the 
          delay on the secondary weapon is meaningless <u>unless</u> it is greater 
          than the delay on your primary. Each time a weapon is used, it becomes 
          inactive for an amount of time, denoted by the delay of the weapon. 
          As long as your secondary weapon recycles quicker (or at the same time) 
          as your primary weapon, it will always be available when Duel Wield 
          succeeds. If your secondary weapon is slower, there is a chance that 
          Duel Wield will roll successfully, but that weapon hasn’t recycled yet, 
          resulting in a lost attack. So, to implement this theory, basically 
          you want a secondary weapon with as high a damage as you can find, and 
          with a delay <u>no greater than</u> your primary weapon.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;So, 
          you will recall that earlier I said a Warrior’s damage output is really 
          for one specific task. Basically a Warrior is meant to take the brunt 
          of the assault, but this cannot be done if the enemy has other targets 
          in mind. The Warrior must present himself as the most imminent threat 
          to a mob in order to do his job right, thus the need for weapons mastery. 
          This brings me to the final section of this guide...<b> </b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>&quot;Bah, 
          ‘tis but a flesh wound! Come here, I’ll bite your ankles, I will!&quot; 
          (Tanking):</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Here 
          we are at the most important of the Warrior’s roles, our very reason 
          for existance: getting hurt. And most of the time, getting hurt bad. 
          We are the ones who stare that beast in the eye(s), attempt to ignore 
          its foul breath, and keep it busy while the others do their thing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;One 
          skill is central to this: Taunt. Keeping it maxed at all times is a 
          must, and knowing when to use it is just as important. First of all, 
          let’s look at how taunt works. Each mob has its Aggression (or Aggro) 
          Table... basically a list of all the things it currently hates. It will 
          always go for the target on the top of that list. Now, a person’s placement 
          on that list is determined by many things: how close they are to the 
          mob, how much damage they have done to the mob, how vulnerable of a 
          target they are, and faction standing are just a few of what I am sure 
          are many factors in evaluating aggro. What taunt does, if successful, 
          is to take the Warrior and place him or her just a tad bit higher on 
          the list than the person who was previously at the top. Taunt does nothing 
          if you are currently at the top of that list. And, unless you back that 
          taunt up with some damage, the next aggressive action by the person 
          you just replaced will bring the mob right back to him or her.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Your 
          responsibility as a Warrior is to keep yourself at the top of that list, 
          for all mobs, at all times. This requires a little effort, because you 
          in your gleaming metal armor are a far less enticing treat than that 
          frail looking caster in a flimsy robe. The fact that casters often do 
          so much damage at once just increases the difficulty. So here are a 
          few tips...</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;First 
          of all, insist to your party, particularly the nukers, that they hold 
          off for around 15-20 seconds before blasting. Stand toe to toe with 
          the mob right from the start, so that by the time they start blasting, 
          you have already done enough damage to keep its attention. Ask that 
          a Druid or Wizard cast a damage shield on you just before the start 
          of the battle. Damage shields are incredible for keeping up aggro, and 
          will work on all monsters that are attacking you.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;The 
          problem is further confused when you have a Druid or Ranger pulling 
          with Snare. Snare tends to really tick off creatures, and it can be 
          very difficult to taunt them off. When you see the Ranger or Druid come 
          in with the pull, stand directly in line with them, so the mob has to 
          run past you to get to the puller. Time your Auto Attack so that you 
          take a swipe at it just as it is running past. This takes a little practise, 
          but after a while can be done with ease. Firing a few arrows at the 
          mob while it is being reeled in also goes a long way to ensure it sticks 
          to you.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;Another 
          non-aggressive spell that carries a huge taunt component is Healing. 
          Any Cleric (or Druid or Shaman) that casts a heal spell risks pulling 
          a mob onto them. As a Warrior, the last thing you want is your healer 
          distracted by a creature pounding on them. Keep an eye on the health 
          bars of your healers (as well as other casters) when dealing with multiple 
          creatures. As soon as you see one of those bars drop, immediately leave 
          your current target alone and taunt the mob off your healer. Smack it 
          around a bit to make sure it stays with you, then go back to the first 
          one and finish it off. In a group with more than one tank, one should 
          be designated as the &quot;bodyguard&quot; for the casters, while the 
          other one stays with the current target. The tank with the highest taunt 
          skill and fastest weapons should be chosen as the bodyguard.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="ffffff">&#9;It 
          is often stated that the only thing more difficult than playing an Enchanter 
          is playing <u>with </u>an Enchanter. Enchanters require tanks to pay 
          special attention to what is going on and to communicate their target 
          to the Enchanter, so that he or she knows which ones to mesmerize. Always 
          stick with your first target (unless the above situation arises), that 
          way you won’t accidentally break a well placed &quot;mez&quot; (this 
          also means putting that Painbringer or Sword of Skyfire away. Besides, 
          Area Effects are best left in the capable hands of finger-twiddlers 
          anyway.) Once your target is dead, agree with your group which one you 
          will take next. But, before you break that mez, there is one thing that 
          you must do: taunt! Go to each mezzed mob and taunt it. Mesmerization 
          really makes creatures angry, and they will beeline right to the Enchanter 
          soon as it is broken... unless you make them even more angry at you. 
          With mobs that verbally respond, wait until you see the &quot;I’ll teach 
          you...&quot; indication that your taunt has succeeded. Otherwise, 3 
          taunts or so should do it. By the way, <u>huge</u> thanks go out to 
          Kaiytlyn of the Spirit of the Moon for opening my eyes to this very 
          simple yet very effective tactic! Do it, it works.</font></p>
