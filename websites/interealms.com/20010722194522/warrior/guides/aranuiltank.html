<B>Primary Tank</B><BR><BR>

Those two words can mean different things in different scenarios. In this guide, I will attempt to explain the role of the primary tank in three different scenarios, group, raid, and uber-mob. I will also describe strategies for holding aggro, weapon use, and what to do if you are not the primary tank.<BR><BR> 

In a solo group environment, a primary tank is the melee class that is generally responsible for calling targets, breaking mezzes, and taking the brunt of the damage dealt by the mobs. All of the other tanks in the group are /assisting the primary tank, and generally trying not to aggro the mobs. This is done to allow the cleric a single target to focus on for healing. Generally only spot healing will be required for the remaining group members. With a primary tank in a single group environment, the group has a focal point for damage, and the cleric has a focal point for healing.<BR><BR> 

In a raid environment (Hate/Fear/Sky/Chardok/City of Mist), a primary tank is again responsible for calling targets, and breaking mezzes. In general, clerics are healing their own groups, and having a damage focal point is not critical because the mobs are not hitting for enough damage to require it. <BR><BR>

In the above two cases, a primary tank as a damage focal point can be a nice to have, but it is certainly not a requirement for anything other than breaking mezzes.<BR><BR> 

There are however situations where a primary tank is a requirement. With the inclusion of Veeshan's peak, certain Kunark uber-mobs, certain Epic quest uber-mobs, and virtually every Velious uber-mob the role of the primary tank becomes a must-have for these high-level encounters. The reasons for this are two-fold. First, these mobs are hitting for 400+, and depending on the mob, quad-hitting for 900, in addition to any magic damage being done. Second, these mobs have well in excess of 32k hitpoints, so the combat duration of the encounter is greatly increased.<BR><BR> 

In these scenarios, giving healers a focal point is a necessity. The primary tank's job is simply to hold aggro, while everyone else's job is to allow him/her to do that.<BR><BR> 

This leads to the question, <i>"What can I do to be a better primary tank?"</i><BR><BR> 

There are many things that can be done to accomplish this.<BR><BR> 

Levels have a lot to do with it. Ideally, you want to be the highest level tank at the encounter. This will allow you to land more hits, increasing your place on the mobs hate list, and allowing you to hold aggro better. Additionally, levels generally equate to higher hitpoints, and higher AC, so you will be able to last a bit longer in combat. <BR><BR>

Race is an important factor. If I were on a raid, even if I were level 60, if there was a level 60 ogre warrior there, he would be a choice as a primary tank because he cannot be stunned from the front, and he will have a great deal more hitpoints than I will. There are other factors, such as weapons, AC, etc. But generally, the tank with the highest hitpoints and armor class should be the primary tank. Barbarians are generally a better choice than half-elves for example because they have higher hitpoints. <BR><BR>

Positioning is also <B>very</B> important. Ideally if you are the primary tank you want to be as close to the front of the mob as possible without causing the "you cannot see your target" message. When the mob moves forward, you want to move with him, not stand in one place. Generally, this will look strange on your monitor. You might be halfway through the mob, but still hitting it. As long as you are as close as you can cause melee damage, and taunt, you are in the right place.<BR><BR> 

Taunting. This is critical. Your taunt, and kick button should <B>never</B> be white, always grayed out. Never stop hitting your taunt button until the mob is dead. <BR><BR>

High-speed, high-aggro-procing weapons are critical as well. When you are the primary tank, two-handed weapons do not exist for you. You will dual-wield, and you will use your fastest weapons, and if possible fast weapons with high-aggro procs. You cannot hope to hold aggro with a 2hander if you are a warrior, and though you might be able to as a Paladin, Ranger, or ShadowKnight with supplemental spells, faster weapons that are hitting more often are better. If you are the primary tank, and you have a 2hander with a proc you would love to have on the mob snare/slow/tash/etc. make sure you pass it off to one of the backup tanks <B>before</B> you enter combat. Once you have identified yourself as the primary tank, you cannot switch to a 2hander during the encounter. <BR><BR>

Your goal as a primary tank is to hold aggro at all costs. You must be able to give that encounter your full attention until the mob is dead. You must use your best weapons, taunt constantly, and stay glued to the mob until it is dead. Why is all of this so important? <B>You</B> are the focal point for healing. All of the other melee and casters are relying upon <B>you</B> to hold aggro, and are doing their best not to aggro. If you are not taunting, or you are using the wrong weapons, or have bad positioning, even if the backup tanks are doing everything perfectly, they can still get aggroed needlessly. If the healers are not paying attention to anyone but the primary tank, there is a good possibility that the backup melee will die needlessly. If too many backup melee die needlessly, you will be doing corpse recovery. I have been at encounters where the primary tank was not doing these things. I stood there, turned off attack, and watched as the mob drained down my 4100hps to nearly nothing while waiting for the primary tank to regain aggro. Had they been doing the right things, I never would have aggroed in the first place. <BR><BR>

This seems like a good opportunity to discuss strategies if you are a backup melee in an uber-encounter. It is not always necessary to use 2handed weapons as a backup tank. You can still be successful with dual-wield if you are paying attention. Ideally, you want to be standing at the very edge of melee aggro range. You NEVER press your taunt button, you might not even use kick/slam. If the mob aggros you at all, you turn off attack. Once the primary tank has regained aggro, wait an additional 5-10 seconds before re-engaging to ensure that you are lower on the hate list. Your goal is to stay alive during this fight, and do consistent damage without the need for heals. If you waste too much of the clerics mana that was destined to heal the primary tank, you will be doing corpse recovery.<BR><BR> 

When individuals work together toward a common goal with common, sound tactics, <B>anything</B> is possible, and any encounter is winnable. The above are my opinions based on experience, and observation/questioning others. If anyone has anything to add or any corrections, please feel free to submit them. I am working on putting together a Warrior Class guide, and this will likely be incorporated into it. I was not sure that this was suited for the library, but if it is, we can put it there.<BR><BR>
