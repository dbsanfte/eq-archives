<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The quests for
    the Cudgels center around the the shaman guild in Cabilis. Anyone can do
    them, but only a shaman can use the cudgels. Furthermore, anyone not an iksar
    will have the mighty task of acquiring sufficient faction in Cabilis before
    they can even start on the cudgels themselves. Once you do, acquiring the
    items and fighting the fights also takes much time and great strength. You
    are at the beginning of a lengthy journey. But at the end of it lies:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Faction</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These are the
    factions in Cabilis:<br>
  </font>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Legion of Cabilis
      - guards and other warriors </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scaled Mystics
      - shamans </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Crusaders of
      Greenmist - shadowknights, including guards named "Crusader" </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Swifttails
      - monks </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cabilis Residents
      - other general citizens, including most vendors and the bankers </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Brood of Kotiz
      - necromancers </font>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Iksar shamans
    should start with sufficient faction all the way around, and can skip all
    of the faction work. Trolls, ogres, barbarians, vah shir, and guktans will
    need to do a lot of brownnosing. Ultimately, you need to be amiable or better
    to the Scaled Mystics, the shaman guild, in order to do the quests. You will
    start by working your way to dubious with the Legion of Cabilis by killing
    things, and then can do turn-in quests to work up the Shamans. In the process
    of working up the shamans, you'll also improve your standing with everyone
    else except the necromancers. So by the time you can actually start doing
    turn-ins for the quest, you will probably be tolerated by everyone in Cabilis
    except the necromancers. You can improve your faction with the necros if
    you like, but it's not necessary for the quest and takes far, far, far more
    work on top of everything you already have to do.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While you are
    working on the Legion faction, /consider any of the Trooper guards that stand
    to either side of the archway to the zone outside any of the four entrances
    to Cabilis. Be sure that you are /conning the stationary guards that stand
    directly on either side and not the Crusaders that usually wander around
    the entrance area. Nothing dangerous in any of those areas should see invis,
    so you can just run around the buildings outside the zone to target a Trooper
    and then run back out to somewhere safe to drop invis and /con. Once you
    start working on the rest of Cabilis, a good npc to /con is Oracle Qulin.
    He is a shaman on the Mystics of Cabilis faction and is down on the shore
    along the water at the north end of the Field of Bone. Neither he nor anything
    else in his immediate vicinity see invis, so you can safely run along the
    shore while invis to find him, and stand a short distance away to drop invis
    and consider him. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>What to Hunt</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So, your first
    goal is to kill stuff until the guards tolerate you. There are a variety
    of options here, the main ones being:<br>
  </font>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">goblins and
      sarnaks in Warslik's Woods, Lake of Ill Omen, Overthere, and Burning Woods </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">frogloks and
      shrooms in Sebilis </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">outcast iksar
      around Kunark (including pariahs, bandits, footpads, etc) </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">drixies, pilgrims,
      and scouts in Firiona </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">explorers in
      Lake of Ill Omen (in yellow tower between Cabilis and lake area) </font>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Killing explorers
    in LoIO or drixies, pilgrims, and scouts in Firiona will all hurt faction
    with Firiona, Kelethin, and Kaladim. The explorers, however, drop stackable
    knives that you can save to eventually turn in to a Cabilis guard for <i>much</i> bigger
    positive hits to Legion of Cabilis than the other quests. If you are willing
    to sacrifice the good faction and store the knives until you reach dubious,
    this will definitely save you gobs of time. Or, if you have any interest
    in doing the <a 
href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2275">Crown of Deceit</a> quest
    for the illusion: wood elf item, killing frogloks in Sebilis will improve
    the faction you need with Guk at the same time. Killing the various types
    of outcast iksar will improve your Brood of Kotiz at the same time, if you
    plan to eventually work on necromancer faction as well.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For reference,
    the levels of faction from best to worst are:<br>
  </font>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ally </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">warmly </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">kindly </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">amiable </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">indifferent </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">apprehensive
      - lowest at which vendors will deal with you </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">dubious - lowest
      at which bankers will deal with you </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">threatening
      - will sometimes agro </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">scowling -
      will always agro (unless very green, for some things) </font>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We also have at
    our disposal enchanters and the alchemy illusion potions. If you have an
    enchanter willing to come along and illusion you the zillion of times that
    will be involved, you are a lucky shaman. Otherwise, iksar meat is rarer
    than most, but not too rare to be worth seeking. The only known drop so far
    is off of iksar broken skull mercenaries in Dulak's Harbor. Combine one iksar
    meat with wormwood bought in the Gulf of Gunthak in your medicine bag. It
    is a difficult combine, trivial in the low 170s. (More detail on the recipe
    and ingredients is available at <a 
href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=8310&menustr=035000000000">EQ
    Traders</a>.) If your own alchemy skill is not adequate and you cannot find
    another shaman to combine for you, try the Bazaar.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The difficulty
    with illusions for the faction work is that there is no way to know when
    you have reached the point where a it will make you non-kos so you can start
    doing quests, except to keep putting up the illusion and conning things.
    At some point while you are still scowling but have done a LOT of work, you
    could try using illusion to test. Or you could just wait until you are threatening
    with the guards and use illusions to start quests then. You do want to start
    quests as soon as you can because that is how you will get faction with the
    rest of Cabilis. You will be getting warrior faction at the same time then,
    too, so there is no reason to spend extra time on warrior faction once you
    can start questing. But if you do not want to use illusions much or at all,
    there is no harm in killing things until threatening or dubious.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you are dubious
    to the Legion of Cabilis, either as you are or with illusion, it is time
    to switch to quests.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Questing</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By far the fastest
    quest for evils or those willing to sacrifice some good factions is the <a 
href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1663">Explorer Knife</a> quest.
    Give each <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=8004">Explorer Survival Knife</a> off
    of the explorers in the yellow tower in Lake of Ill Omen to Trooper Vaurk,
    who is stationed nearby. The positive Legion hits for this are much larger,
    so you will need to complete the quest only about 80 times (very roughly),
    compared to about 1500 quest completions with the other usual approach. But
    again, you take big negative hits to Firiona, Kelethin, and Kaladim for killing
    the explorers. You may end up kos in those places if this is your primary
    source of Cabilis faction, especially if you were not very high with them
    to start.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you wish to
    preserve those good factions, you will need to give bone chips to Trooper
    Mozo. Lots and lots and lots and lots of bone chips. Lots. And lots. Mozo
    is one of the two troopers guarding the zone to Cabilis in Field of Bone.
    Every time you give him four bone chips, he will give you 7 silver pieces
    and one positive hit to every Cabilis faction except for the necros. The
    trick is that there are wandering Crusaders that come very close while you
    are feeding him the chips. In order to do this safely, first explore Mozo's
    area thoroughly while invis. Learn exactly where the Cabilis zone is; you
    can zone safely if you get attacked, as long as you don't go too far from
    the zone on the other side. When you are ready to start, put up your illusion
    if need be. The first time you try this, you might also want to buff up,
    particularly with sow, until you have stood in position uninvis while the
    Crusaders walked by without agroing. They will come unnervingly close to
    you, but will not agro if you are in exactly the right place. While invis,
    position yourself next to Trooper Mozo, between him and the wall at his side,
    northwest of him. You do NOT want to be at the wall behind him, between him
    and the zone. Stand right up against that wall alongside Mozo, as close to
    the wall as you can get and as close to Mozo as you can get without putting
    space between yourself and the wall. Face Mozo and drop invis. Duck and tap
    your forward arrow ever so slightly, taking a tiny step forward. Pick up
    a bone chip on your cursor. Attempt to give it to Trooper Mozo. You will
    need to do this a few times before you get close enough, but you want to
    try after every step so you stay as far back as possible. You do have a little
    bit of leeway, so once you learn about where you need to be you will be better
    able to eyeball it. But be careful, because it's not a lot of leeway and
    those Crusaders are high level shadowknights with harm touch that hurts!
    Not to mention the fact that the Troopers will assist the shadowknights if
    they agro.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you start
    doing this, you will need to give him approximately 6000 bone chips to become
    dubious with most of the rest of Cabilis. Yes, that is 30 full 10-slot bags
    of bone chips. And that is just to get where you don't have to sneak around
    as much anymore. You will still need a few more bags of chips after that
    to max out your factions. Keep in mind that these numbers are only a very
    rough approximation, as your race and diety will affect how each of the factions
    within Cabilis will react to you. For example, shadowknights may tolerate
    trolls sooner than they would guktans, while monks may react to both trolls
    and guktans the same. I made up that example, but is the kind of thing that
    happens. But really, with the vast numbers of bone chips we're talking about,
    a few hundred here or there really isn't important. Just remember that you
    need to con every single faction individually whenever you want to know for
    sure where you stand. It is also true that different factions may max at
    different levels, again depending on your race and diety. When I did this
    as a barbarian, I found that by the time I was maxxed at indifferent with
    the shamans, I was already apprehensive or better with everyone except the
    necros. So in my descriptions of how to do things, I will assume that you
    also are at least non-kos with everyone except the necros. If you don't get
    that high with the others by the time you max your shaman faction, I recommend
    taking the little bit of extra time to get them up so that you don't have
    to worry about getting jumped by things that left me alone when you follow
    my directions. If one of them maxes out while still kos, you will need to
    be very careful when doing any of the interactions in Cabilis. More numbers
    from a paladin's perspective, but with excellent detail, are available on
    the <a 
href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathtomesofknowledge.showMessage?topicID=66.topic">Paladins
    of Norrath message board</a>. That writeup is very old but has loads of detail. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It takes quite
    a lot of time to gather all those bone chips. Some suggested sources include:<br>
  </font>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bazaar - sometimes
      in huge amounts, but can get expensive </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">vendors - check
      the most convenient vendors in zones with skeletons (South Ro, Nek Forest,
      Freeport, Everfrost...) </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">necromancer
      with Flesh to Bone AA - converts most meat or body parts into bone chips,
      including many vendor supplied meats </font>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kurn's Tower
      - conveniently located in Field of Bone, and chock full of skeletons. If
      you gather bones here, be sure to read up on the third cudgel first so
      that you can watch for the drops. You may even wish to auction for them
      while in the zone now. </font>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are numerous
    other quests that you can do out of Cabilis but they generally either require
    working the other factions up most of the way anyway, or far more time collecting
    materials. Bone chips or explorer knives are almost certainly going to be
    best in the end.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's very possible
    that you will max your shaman faction before you reach amiable. I did as
    a barbarian. In that case, you will need to use illusion every time you do
    a turn-in.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this point
    you need to learn your way around Cabilis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cabilis</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cabilis is divided
    into two zones: East Cabilis and West Cabilis. West Cabilis is chock full
    of necromancers, and therefore probably still very dangerous to the non-iksar
    shaman. Happily, depending on how you decide to start the cudgel quest, you
    will need it only a very little or not at all. East Cabilis is the zone you
    need to learn. From the Field of Bone zone, the shaman guild is the first
    big building that you see. It will be on the right, with the entrance around
    the front. You can safely come from the zone up the entrance of the guild
    and into the first room and do what you need to do with the shamans there.
    However, there is a cowardly necro upstairs who will not hesitate to sic
    his high level shadowknight buddy on you if you let him see you. So do not
    go upstairs (by stepping into the flashy red portals alongside the door)
    without invis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you stand in
    front of the shaman guild, facing the water, there are an array of houses
    off to the left. You should be safe in and around any of them, no necros
    there. To the right of the water, however, there is a necro in the very first
    building after the shaman guild. He is low level but will send the other,
    much higher level iksar in the area after you. Never run past that building
    without invis. I usually just hop in the water in front of the shaman guild
    and swim way around it. I know the wall looks high from down in the water,
    but you should be able to hop out onto land anywhere if you look almost straight
    up. (Guktans, being a smaller race, are the only ones that might need to
    use the ladders placed here and there.) Beyond that building with the necro,
    the remaining buildings are safe, assuming you don't get within agro range
    of that first building. There are some vendors on the corner, and the building
    next to that with wide steps leading down is the bank. You can use that bank
    once you are dubious or better (with everyone but necros), which may come
    in very handy if you, like me, are constantly forgetting to prepare your
    illusion potions in advance or to grab out all the necessary quest items
    before heading into Cabilis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beyond that there
    is another house and then three more in a row. I don't know if there is danger
    there or not, but you'll never need them, so you can safely swim across the
    intervening water to the south if need be. Right in front of you there then
    is the monk guild. You won't need any of them, but chances are good they
    won't mind you being there any more than the other non-necros. Beyond the
    monk guild you will see some vendors with tents in a central island off to
    the left. If you continue along that side of the canal, hugging the right
    wall, you will eventually zone into West Cabilis, which consists mainly of
    the necro guild. If you wish to look around in there, put up invis right
    at the zone and don't let it drop. There are necros all over in there. If,
    instead of zoning, you cross to the other side of the canal and continue
    south, you will reach the warrior guild. I haven't explored it thoroughly
    to see if there are any stray necros, but we don't need it for anything.
    So either stay out or proceed with caution.</font></p>

        Cudgel of the Petitioner</a></b> - Newbie Cudgel</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At last, time
    to get started! The very first step that actually involves a cudgel is getting
    yourself the newbie weapon. Iksar shamans will start with it. The rest of
    us need to either multiquest with an iksar shaman or perform a quest to acquire
    one. The multiquest is easier. Just gather up the quest items for the very
    first cudgel quest (the three skulls, see that writeup for more detail) and
    go to the turn-in person. Bring a newbie shaman iksar there with their newbie
    cudgel. Have the newbie shaman hand over their Iron Cudgel of the Petitioner,
    and then give the turn-in person your skulls. You will get the first quest
    cudgel, the Iron Cudgel of the Clairvoyant.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Alternatively,
    you can do the <a 
href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1259">Penance Quest</a> to
    earn your own cudgel without any multiquesting. This takes longer but can
    be kind of fun if you enjoy doing things the difficult way for the principle
    of the thing. You will need to have two inventory spaces open for containers
    until you finish this step. Enter the shaman guild and you will find Hierophant
    Zand standing to the right on the raised dias. </font></p>
<p>
<blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hierophant
    Zand raises his hand and looks up. 'May the wisdom of the ancients lead your
    soul to suffering and everlasting pain. Such is the will of Cazic-Thule.
    I see something in your eyes, Verdandi. Have you lost something... your cudgel
    perhaps?'</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say, 'Yes'</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hierophant
    Zand says 'That is most unfortunate for you. Your suffering will be extended
    on this plane, until you find your way back to us. Take this and read it
    on your way to speak with the Toilmaster. He will guide you. Yesssss...'
    You feel as if something is peering at you from behind the speaker's soulless
    eyes as the last letter he speaks transforms into a sigh.'</font></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He gives you <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=18271">a
      ragged book</a>. The Toilmaster usually inhabits the building right next
      to the shaman guild, containing the troublesome necro. You can't deal with
      him there, unless you have a skilled chanter who could work out how to
      keep things calm. Fortunately, the Toilmaster periodically strolls next
      door to the building with the walls caved in at approx 820, -20, where
      the froglok slaves sometimes stand and froak. It is still pretty close
      to the necro so you might want to back into the roofed portion of the house
      while you wait for the Toilmaster to arrive. Once he is there you can carefully
      scoot close enough to deal with him. Give him the book from Zand and he
      will hand you back <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=18272">Rites of Exoneration</a>, another

    looks at the tome and speaks to you, scowling, 'Very well, broodling, I have
    a task for you. I should make you work at the feet of my froglok slaves,
    crushing granite, but the lore of the brood has a specific rite for this
    situation. Take this book and learn the will of Cazic-Thule. Read it and
    ask me any questions you may have before you start your penance. It would
    be a shame for you to fail at this task as well... though I wouldn't mind
    destroying you.'</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say, 'I need

    to looking into the distance, just over your left shoulder.</font></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now we need to
    make our one and only jaunt into West Cabilis. Unless you have necromancer
    faction, you may wish to bring an iksar illusion potion or enchanter to project
    iksar illusion on you. I don't know if this is necessary, as the mortician
    is a merchant and wouldn't agro you anyway. He may give you what you need
    without it. But he may not, requiring you to make another trip with illusion
    ready. Either way, from the shaman guild, head south past the bank and monk
    guild and hug that right wall as it turns west to the zone. Put up sow and
    invis, and if you trust your invis as little as I do, some buffs. Tiptoe
    into the zone, put up your illusion, and reinvis. Hug the right wall proceeding
    forward again, until the very first building on the right. Go into that building,
    and the only npc you should see is the Mortician. Go up and stand in front
    of him and drop your invis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say, 'Hail,
    a mortician.'</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a mortician

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say, 'I desire

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a mortician

      you dismissal. You can feel the vile power of your god moving throughout
      the material that makes up the two items.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Put invis back
    up and get the heck out of there. Now you start the tedious part. You need
    to equip the hammer and hit things with it until it procs 54 times. Each
    time it procs you will get a <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24768">Bone Fragment</a>. Put them unstacked
    into the <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=17092">Grotesque Mortar and Pestle</a> until
    you have eight, and then combine them to make a <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24769">Powdered Bone</a>. Put that into
    the Penance Bag. Continue making Bone Fragments and combining them, until
    you have seven Powdered Bone. The hammer has only 4 damage, so just find
    a creature that has enough hit points to last a little while but won't hurt
    you too badly. I used spiders in Velketor's. Having a decent two hand blunt
    skill would probably speed this up quite a bit. According to the people who
    crunch numbers on this sort of thing, dex will help you get the procs faster
    but haste won't help. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you have
    your seven powdered bones, you need a Flask of Bloodwater. If you are a coward
    like me and don't want to poke around Cabilis any more than necessary, you
    can get it from Thom the Fish in Fungus Grove, in the last building on the
    left coming from Echo Caverns. Or, you can buy from any of <a 
href="http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=1616&menustr=035000000000"> several
    other vendors</a> in the Cabilis area. Combine the bloodwater in your penance
    bag with the seven unstacked powdered bone to make a <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24770">Filled Penance Bag</a>. Return
    to Hierophant Zand and give him both the filled bag and the book from the
    Taskmaster to get your Iron Cudgel of the Petitioner.</font></p>
<p>
<blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hierophant
    Zand takes the bag and tome from you and in return gives you the item that
    you have been thinking of all of this time. Lucky, you... you have earned
    a second chance. Praise Cazic-Thule!</font></blockquote>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The outcasts can
    spawn either in the Lake of Ill Omen or in the sewers in Cabilis. They wander
    around the newbie area of the Lake of Ill Omen, so finding them there can
    be tough. Or, you can try the sewers where we'll know exactly where to find
    them. You will want to be at least level 5-10 before attempting the sewers.
    To get there, exit the shaman guild, put up some form of underwater breathing
    if you can, hop into the water, and swim out into the water and around the
    corner to the left. At approximately 520, -480 you will see an underwater
    tunnel leading east. Swim into it. There are various low level fish and other
    critters swimming around in the passage that may agro if you're not invis,
    and you will see openings above every so often. You can use those to grab
    a breath if you need. Swim all the way to the end and hop out of the water.
    There will be two low level creatures there that may agro. They are placeholders
    for the Iksar Outcasts that drop the skulls we need. They are very fast respawns,
    but the Outcasts are rare spawns. Each Outcast will drop one of the three
    skulls, named <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12722">Logrin Skull</a>, <a

href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12723">Waz Skull</a>. The skull drops
    are random, so eventually you'll probably start getting the same one or two
    over and over before you finally get the last one you need. Reports are that
    outcasts will only spawn around that particular pool and not in any of the
    other rooms, not even the hidden room to the back of that pool room. I didn't
    spend a lot of time in any other rooms but didn't see any outcasts anywhere
    else. I did spend a couple hours keeping both that pool room and the hidden
    room off of it clear, but only ever got outcasts in the pool room. If you

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is one of
    the most notorious parts of the cudgel quests. Prepare yourself for a long
    camp and head to Kurn's Tower. The skulls we need drop off of the Undead
    Crusader, approximately level 15. He only spawns at the top of the south
    stairs from the third to fourth floor. There is only one wanderer on the
    steps, but if you are close to the skeletons in level you may have adds if
    you only ever pull the Crusader and his placeholder. He is extremely rare,
    and drops one skull each spawn. You need six skulls: five of <a 
href=http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12730">Iksar Skull with an 'X'</a> (not
    lore) and one of <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12731">Iksar Skull with an 'X'</a> (lore).
    Note that none of them are No Drop, so auctioning to buy them might save
    you some effort. Sit on the stairs where you can see the static skeletons
    at the top on either side of the stairs, and kill the wanderers that spawn
    at the top and on the stairs with you. Eventually, one of the spawns at the
    top will be an Undead Crusader. Kill him, loot his skull, and sit back down
    to wait for another. And another. And another. And another....</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is one report
    that the Undead Crusader also can spawn at the stop of the stairs that lead
    up to the rooms on the third floor. You may wish to make it a habit to head
    there after each kill at the first spot and clear everything on those third
    floor stairs and that's wandering through the hallways in that area.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you get your

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Off to Warslik's

    some action. We need the big goblin fort guarding the bridge across the river
    in the north of the zone, at approximately 3000, 100. Keep a careful eye
    on that river chasm while you're finding the fort and killing the goblins,
    as there are no guard rails and it's a heck of a drop.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our goal is to
    collect five <a

    lore) and one <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12733">Tiny Glowing
    Skull</a> (lore). They drop off of goblin bloodtracers. The bloodtracers
    can spawn in place of any of the other goblins in the fort, so all you need
    to do is start killing goblins. They are rare spawns, and of course the lore
    skull is rarer than the others. There are numerous kinds of goblins in the
    fort, some of which are as high as level 35. They are fairly close together,
    so adds are likely even if you are much higher than them. At 61 I just sent
    my pet on a rampage and was able to clear the fort just a couple minutes
    before it started respawning. It took a few clearings to get all of my skulls.
    Even if you are well above the goblins in level, some buffs might make things
    go a little smoother. You will still need to heal every so often. The toughest
    goblins, including the named Grachnist the Destroyer, might be worth slowing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you have

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These next two
    skulls will take several steps. One of them is a simple drop, but the other
    comes from an iksar who requires you to bring him two keys plus 400 gold.
    The keys, in turn, drop as one intact and the other in three pieces. You
    use the second piece of mendglow clay to put the three pieces back together.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first skull, <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12741">Iksar Skull Helm</a>, comes from
    sarnaks in the Lake of Ill Omen. While they are rare drops from several varieties
    of sarnaks, they'll drop every time off of sarnak adherents. Adherents can
    be found in the hallways and rooms built into the hillside of the fort and
    are as high as level 29.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the second
    skull, the first drop is the <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12742">Dai Nozok skull canopic</a>,
    which drops off Overseer Dlubish in the Frontier Mountains goblin caves at
    approx -2000, +2000. He may be a random spawn from any of the other goblins
    or may only spawn at the intersection between the second and third chamber.
    Either way, he's rare. While you are there, kill any goblin rockchanters
    you see and save a tan colored stone drop if you get one. It is for the sixth
    cudgel. Also, if you get any spawns of "an Iksar Slave", see the details
    of the sixth cudgel for how to determine whether he is the Iksar Slave you
    will need. If he is, get his skull now if you can.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next head out
    to the Swamp of No Hope. You need to kill froglok ton warriors and loot four
    different drops from them. It seems that froglok ton warriors from anywhere
    in the zone will work. But as the ton warriors are somewhat rare and getting
    one of each of the four different drops will take a lot of warriors, you
    may wish to find an open stretch of ground and kill everything that moves
    to spawn warriors. One commonly used spot that worked for me is the iksar
    brigand camp at 2600, 100. I killed every wanderer I laid eyes on, particularly
    the frogloks. The three pieces are the <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12747">Piece of Totem</a> (Bottom), <a

    The intact totem that you also need is the <a

    spend several hours out there before you get your last piece.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now you need that
    other Mendglow Clay, same as the one we used in the second cudgel quest.
    Combine the three Pieces of Totem with the Mendglow Clay in a pottery wheel
    to make the second <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12744">Ton Warrior Totem</a>. Take your
    two Ton Warrior Totems, Dai Nozok skull canopic and 400 gold pieces out to
    the Overthere to the evil outpost. The iksar we talk to is indifferent to
    all, so no illusion is necessary. If you are kos in the outpost, you can
    reach the iksar from the PoK book by putting up invis and heading north to
    the water. Swim out to the far end of the wall and then go around it and
    come back to shore hugging the other side. Stay along the wall until you
    reach level ground and you'll see Galdon Vok Nir tucked into a corner there.
    Give him the two totems, canopic, and gold, and he will give you in return

    ' :-) '], <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12749">An Iksar Skull</a> [Engraving
    ' >:) '], and <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12748">An Iksar Skull</a> [Engraving
    ' =P ']. I'm not sure which one comes at which step of this quest, or what
    the meaning (if any) of the emoticon engravings might be, but those are the
    items we will ultimately need for this cudgel.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next you would
    head to the Atheling Plague in Burning Woods. Because reaching him is a real
    pain, I recommend collecting what he needs before going to talk to him. What
    he needs is the skull of a prisoner of the goblins. He is a rare spawn in
    the goblin caves in Frontier Mountains where we found Overseer Dublish and
    the rockchanters. Somewhere in there you will find two iksar slaves with
    slightly varying names. The one on the right is the crazed iksar for the
    monk shackle quest. You can ignore him. The one on the left will be either
    a shadowknight in yellow armor or will be our shaman. You will need to kill
    the shadowknight placeholder to get the shaman. When you do get the right
    iksar to spawn, you can hail him if you wish:</font></p>
<blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">an Iksar
    slave peers up at you. His face is covered with grime and he shows scars
    from goblin whips. He shakes his head and goes back to his thoughts.</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You say, 'who
    are you?'</font> </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">an Iksar slave
      says 'It has been a long time since I have been asked that. I am Digalis,
      mystic of Cabilis.' </font></p>
  <p></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Poor guy. You
    get hits for killing him too. The Atheling Plague is not a nice guy, even
    by Cabilis standards. The hits you take aren't big, but might knock you back
    a level and require you to top off with more explorer knives or bone chips,
    especially if you're only barely acceptable to any of the iksar factions
    his death affects. Loot his <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12764">Iksar Skull</a>. </font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now for the tricky
    bit. You need to reach the Atheling Plague, a sarnak high in the east tower
    of the sarnak fort just outside Chardok, above the outer fort wall entrance.
    He is alone in his tower and is indifferent to all, so don't worry about
    him just yet. What you need to worry about is getting to him, as the usual
    methods like stairs are noticably absent. There is supposedly a quest you
    can do for a key that will allow you to click something somewhere that will
    take you up there. Alas, that is all the detail I could find. Alternatively,
    the most common method is to fire up levitate and some speed spells, climb
    up the mountainside to the east as high as you can without getting too far
    away, and attempt to run to the room. If you have the least bit of lag, however,
    you may be physically unable to reach it before you descend too far. In that
    case, you could try what I did, having a mage with Call of the Hero and a
    speedy machine make the run and then CoH you into the room. Having a wizard
    Gravity Flux you up there has been known to work as well. Just be careful
    not to agro the sarnaks at the nearby entrance, as all of them at once will
    be a handful at any level.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once you are up
    there, consider binding right there in the tower. Some shamans have reported
    that during the fight to come they were teleported by the Atheling Plague
    down to the room full of sarnaks just outside the Chardok zone. They say
    they were put in a safe spot but then had to get back up the tower to finish
    the fight, or start over by getting another skull. This does not seem to
    be a common problem but definitely can happen. If you have any trouble at
    all getting into the tower, binding is definitely a good idea, provided you
    are confident that you can handle the level 35-40 mob you will fight. It
    has been reported as soloable by a 44 shaman, in spite of being healed by
    the Atheling Plague during the fight. Bring help if you want to bind but
    are at all concerned about your ability to solo it. </font>

    he departs. Say hello, Doval.' </font>

</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of all the nerve!
    Clerk Doval is a traitor to Cabilis and has our second skull. Move as far
    from the Atheling Plague as you can before fighting Doval, to reduce your
    chances of being teleported out. When you fight him, attempt to keep him
    as far from the Atheling Plague as possible. Try to kill him fast, as he
    will get healed by the Atheling Plague. The Atheling itself shouldn't actually
    attack you, however. Loot the second "An Iksar Skull".</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, for the last
    skull. The trail of lore to this point is somewhat hazy, but talking to Klok
    Poklon in the Tink n' Babble near the shaman guild in Cabilis (with the necro,
    non-iksar shouldn't go here) yields the following:</font></p>

      Lake Garrison has one of the Sister's of Scale Skull up for Auction. The
      Temple will bury him when they hear of it!'</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Klok we need
    is Klok Sargin, who is on top of one of the buildings just outside Cabilis
    in the Lake of Ill Omen.</font></p>

  <p></p>
  <p></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The helm we need
    is the <a 
href="http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=12761">Sarnak Dragoon Helm</a> that
    drops off of sarnak dragoons back at the sarnak fort where we found the adherents.
    Note that the helm is No Rent, so do not go after it until you are ready
    to turn it in (including any preparations for illusion to do the turn in,
    if necessary). The dragoons are somewhat rarer but should be around. If you
    cannot find any, start killing sarnaks deep inside the fort and eventually
    dragoons will spawn. Once you get your helm, immediately run to give it to
    Klok Sargin. </font></p>
<blockquote><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Klok
    Sargin appears a little shaken. He has a few bruises on his face. 'Uhh. Thanks.

    and, well, he was kinda mad, and... Verdandi, meet Bruiser.'</font></blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The iksar Bruiser
    will spawn now. He claims to be level 30 and certainly isn't any harder than
    that, for all of Klok Sargin's cowardice.</font></p>

    this, Klok !! I didn't spend 30 seasons in the legion to be pestered by the
    likes of you!! Here I am, you little croak!! You want my skull? Come and
    get it!!' </font>
    <p> </p>
    <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Klok Sargin shakes
    with fear. A dark stain begins to spread across the front of his trousers.

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wuss. Kill Bruiser.
