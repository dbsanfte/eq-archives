      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Some people
      believe there is an anti-camp zone on the Preacher, Archeologist, and
      other special spawns. One player has suggested the anti-camp is GM
      controlled (ie. the switch is set if the GM sees problems in there). I do
      know that if we retreat all the way out of the room, and wait in the
      house, the Preacher has spawned more, but my sample size is too small to
      trust. Some campers in that room have had 5 Preachers in a row. Some have
      camped the room for hours and never seen the Preacher. The same goes for
      ALL the special spawns in Permafrost. They seem to be very inconsistent on
      the spawn probability. All you can do is be patient. The spawn will come.
      There are many similarities to Drelzna in Najena, except the rare loads
      are a little more frequent in my opinion. So, my opinion is, no, there's
      no anti-camp.<o:p>

      of the class specific armours to replace Rubicite, many people are seeking
      the Ice Goblin Wizard. This is a uncommon spawn in Permafrost, but
      fortunately, it does not have a single spawn point. He is an alternate on
      the Preacher, Archeologist, and Alchemist spawns, and can be found on many
      of the non-special spawn points near these, and at the top of the throne
      room. He can spawn near the first gate, and may even have appeared once
      for me in the Flag Room, but that is not certain (very old memory). The
      Wizard spawns the Shaman Totemic Armor Permafrost Snowball and a Temple of
      Sol Ro Wizard quest item.<o:p>

      a room, you can't get lost. L15 to 18 PC's should stick to the zone edge
      and lure to there. Root MOB's, as there is a bug that will cause MOB's to
      teleport to the top of the ladder. Ensnare won't prevent this until the
      MOB no longer moves.<o:p>

      in the flag room. The spawn is fast here (15 minutes or less), so two
      groups can simultaneously occupy the room. There is a safe place off to
      the right as you enter. This alcove like area does not get spawned on and
      is out of the MOB's sight as they get trained through the room.<o:p>

      the left side of the room by the cave like exit there and find the door on
      the left. This leads to the house. Inside the first door is the foyer,
      with two spawn points. There is a closet on either side of the room.
      Through the door straight ahead, there is dead end and a lone spawn on the
      left, but the right passage leads to the house. Three spawn points in the
      main room here, and typically two casters. This room is a good place to
      use as a base camp for hitting the Archeologist, so I'll go there next.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Go through the
      door in the main room. Here you will find another room, but this one has a
      busted wall. This IS an archeologist we are talking about, and he's been
      hard at work tracking his way deeper into an ancient Combine Empire city.
      Just behind that wall, a goblin spawns, and luring it will draw another.
      Now pass through the broken wall into the short tunnel. Here, you will
      find a few more goblins, luring the front will bring three. Now that the
      tunnel is clear, you will find you way into a large open area. There is a
      platform in front of you, with three goblins on it. to your left is a
      overhanging bridge with one goblin on top and two further back underneath.
      Luring from this room is an art. What you get depends on what you attack.
      First, the Archeologist spawns on top of the snow mound just right of the
      tombstone on the raised platform. Do not directly attack that spawn.
      Attack the spawn to its right. This will bring four: the three from the
      platform and the one on top of the bridge. So, that's the Archeologist
      spawn. Now, for more fun, if you lure under that bridge on the left next,
      lure from the right. If you lure the left of that two, you will get jumped
      by five or six, but the one on the right is just out of attack range of a
      number of spawn points, so you get two, and can grab the rest back there
      later. Now, right of the platform, there is a passage. There is no spawn
      behind the door there, so go ahead and look inside. I won't spoil that
      interesting sight. It may have a purpose... Anyway, further down that hall
      are more spawn points worthy of a group of L21-23, so you can push deeper.
      This passage continues until it comes out back near the tombstone in the
      Archeologist Room. Now, do be careful. There is a trapdoor somewhere on
      the platform that can drop you into the Dire Wolf room. I believe the trap
      is close to the bridge.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, the
      Preacher. Back to the main room of the house. There you'll find a hallway.
      Just run up that hallway, and you'll find a large room. Two spawns on your
      immediate right as you enter, and three on the dais. This IS the preacher
      room. Many Casters spawn here, so it can be lethal to break. There are
      three weak spawns at the far rear behind the dais, but they do not join in
      when you attack the preacher. Prelates can spawn on the dais, as well as
      wizards. Priests are frequent spawns especially on the two floor spawns.
      At the extreme rear of the room is a door.<o:p>

      is a hallway that leads to the Dire Wolf room. I don't know how attractive
      that room is for exp: I believe it is only used as an extra lure location
      when people camp on the Preacher. This Dire Wolf room is where you land if

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Now we were also
      wanting that Alchemist, right? Okay, back to the Flag room. Take the right
      exit from the flag room and you'll fight a few spawns and hit a gate. Open
      the gate like a door and pass by the gate on the left. Do this invis and
      /con ALL the spawns in front of you. They range up to at least L25 MOB's.
      Now, after clearing this out, you'll see a door and a rock on the left of
      the door. Go to the rock and click on it like a door. It will slide open.
      The Alchemist spawns behind that rock. Only one other spawns with it. <o:p>

      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">There is that
      very attractive door waiting beside the Alchemist. Well, open it! Okay,
      you'll find you can go right, middle, or left. If you go right, you will
      have a few spawns to deal with, then discover yourself in the Bear room.
      Why the Bear room? Well, step onto the dais and look above the ramp.
      Right, from the bear room, you can go down this ramp, or out the left end
      of the room. The left exit leads back to the middle hallway, so I'll deal
      with that in the next paragraph. Down the ramp, you'll find a T
      intersection. Well, head right to the two doors. Each has three L20-23
      spawns. Take them down counter-clockwise. You shouldn't try to pull from
      the room. Pile into it. You could lure more than one room if you try to
      pull. So, after taking down those two rooms, you can take down the next
      counter-clockwise room. Four spawns there. Now, at the far end of the
      hallway, you'll find two doors and a open room. Well, guys, I can't tell
      you how to break them. We tried twice and wound up with two rooms of 9
      gobs total twice. What I DO know is the Ice Goblin Jailor is in one of
      those rooms, obviously I don't know which one.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, back to the
      door by the Alchemist and take the middle branch. Fight past 6 or so
      goblins (19-24) and you'll hit a doorway. Through that door, you can go
      right through a door that leads to the Bear room. Or you can go left. Left
      leads to the Scryer (past a second door). I have a couple different
      reports on the Scryer room. One said 12 goblins, one said 8. Either way, a
      larger than 6 person group is needed to break the spawn.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Now, back to the
      gates. Past the second gate (the one to the left as you pass the first) is
      a good room for L24-28. The top level spawn is high blue and even up to
      yellow for L25. It takes good teamwork to hold this room at L25.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">At the bottom of
      this room, though, is the Patriarch, the Sage, the Elites Guards, the
      Elite Honor Guard, and a few rare spawns. A few will be yellow to L24 but
      most red, and the five spawns are close together. THIS is the throne room,
      and here are some is the best loot in Permafrost. I received some
      information on this room from an anonymous source, so I can't credit the
      person. I have fought all the spawns listed below, but I did not pay
      particular attention to the position.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">If your group is
      capable of breaking the spawn of these MOB's (I was not present for the
      breaking unfortunately), then you can likely deal with the next threat,
      and it could be one of the most pleasing events in your career...<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">There is a door
      behind at the bottom of the room. Unless you are seriously powerful, be
      careful not to let goblins wander back here. There is a wide agro radius
      on the spawn behind that door. The monster here may only be L35, but it is
      big, it is nasty, and it is a wizard. It's the Ice Giant Diplomat. The
      Diplomat has an interesting spawn. Once killed, a new spawn is popped
      after about 2 minutes. This new spawn can be a few things, an Elite, a
      lowly Prelate, or it can be the Ice Goblin Champoin. The Champion carries
      the Crystalline Blade, a 1HS with excellent stats.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;<o:p>

      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I am told the Ice
      Giants beyond the Diplomat do not have loot beyond normal coin. I can not
      verify this at this time. I can verify that the next two WILL come at you
      in a pair. I have seen it myself. I also saw the Ice Giant Spier/Icy
      Terror (a tentacle terror variant) come with them. Let's just say that the
      24 or so Vox hopefuls got their butts handed to them. At least 4 dead. The
      recovery time for them was so long, these respawned and needed to be dealt
      with again, though one at a time they were far less destructive. I don't
      know if the next lure was intentional, I really couldn't say one way or
      another. Don't let anyone tell you Vision is a waste of a spell. Three Ice
      Giants and an Icy Terror slaughtered half of the Vox hopefuls and forced a
      zone. Now, I don't know if this ALWAYS happens on a Vox hunt, but this
      time it did. Fortunately, your hero was already awaiting them in Everfrost.
      Being a lowly L28, I had no hope of survival, and cowardly left the LD
      Druid to her own devices. The L32 Warrior and L31 Ranger stayed behind and
      had the distinct pleasure of doing battle with the Ice Giant Priest. I
      don't envy them that honor. No one, fortunately, died, but we would not
      return to the Throne room that evening. You see, having Lady Vox herself
      sticking her head through the Diplomat door watching you massacre her
      goblins is a sure way to claim the dubious pleasure of being the lowest
      level to ever be slain by a dragon. Yes, this was truly a SNAFU of the
      highest order. I won't mention the guild's name; however, I can say before
      this the guild had succeeded only once in three tries at slaughtering Vox.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">What I do know

      June and now seems to no longer wander, and it may not exist at all.<o:p>

      myself in Cazic for 25-29 (at least), but so much is out there on this
      dungeon that it makes no sense for me to proceed on a guide to there. I am
      currently working on a guide to East Karana, and I would tell you if I had
      completed it. After that, perhaps Solusek's Eye, but I make no promises.
      There are many excellent MOB loads in Permafrost, and I hope you enjoy
