The Magelo adventure started in 2001 with a Character Profiler for Everquest. It was the first of its kind and it becomes really popular among the community. Since then we extended our services for Everquest, World of Warcraft and Rift players to provide with passion several community tools such as Game Database, Signatures, Gear Planner and much more! 
<br><br>
Magelo is an independent project that survives thanks to your support! We are not affiliated to any group and we don’t use Ads to finance our development. We are just few devoted and passionated people working from home and doing our best to build a great site! Magelo has and will always be community driven, that wouldn't be possible without our <a href="premium.jspa" target=blank>Premium</a> members, so thanks a lot for your support and faith in Magelo!    
<br><br>
Former Members, volunteers, part-time or full-time members, let's meet now the team behind the scene that contribute to build Magelo!

	<div id="jelan" style="position: relative;">
		<div class="prez-title">
			<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;">Chris aka Jelan</span>
			<br>Founder
		</div>
		
		<div class="prez-bottom">
			<div class="prez-top">
				<div class="prez-content">
					Jelan is the founder of Magelo. Even if he studied Finance and Management at University Paris Sorbone he was always passioned by programming and he learned how to code by his own since really young. He discovered online games at their very beginning and spent days and nights on Ultima Online and Everquest. You will maybe remember his favorite character <a href="http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1" target=blank>Jelan the Swift</a> ;) 
<br><br>
The Magelo adventure started when he had the idea to create a profiler system for his guildmates on Everquest to show their character equipments, stats and other characteristics outside the game. 
<br><br>
Today Jelan is no longer alone in this adventure and he continues to guide the site and is responsible of programming and technical innovations. He is one of the lucky guys in the world that could transform his passion in a daily job. He never thought about Magelo as a job actually, he takes care of it since day one with his deeply personal roots as gaming purist.  
<br><br>
When he is not glued on his computer, between 3 and 6 in the morning, he sleeps! I am kidding just a little bit ;) Magelo takes a lot of place in his life but Jelan still finds some time to play his little Necro casually. He also loves playing volleyball on the beach with his buddies and is an avid consumer of Manga, Tv-shows or any Tech blogs he can find on the web :)

	<div id="loulina" style="position: relative;">
		<div class="prez-title">
			<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;">Claire aka Loulina</span>
			<br>Design and Communication Manager
		</div>
		
		<div class="prez-bottom">
			<div class="prez-top">
				<div class="prez-content">
					Loulina is the only girl in the team and just for that she has a great merit ;) She joined Magelo in 2004 when Jelan wanted to re-design the site. She was project manager in an advertising agency in Paris, not designer... but she jumped into this new challenge and proudly designed many web pages and various illustrations and interfaces such as the character profiles.
<br><br>
Beside the design, Loulina works closely with the team to define our tools and she is in charge of presenting them on the site through news and other contents. She brings also with passion new ideas such as the Sig maker and tries to spread the words about Magelo on the communities around. 
<br><br>
Magelo takes a lot of space in her life and she is proud to be involved every day in its construction and improvement. When she is not working on Magelo, she doesn’t miss Glee or other cool Tv-shows. She also loves hiking, yoga, Jelan (yes, partner in life too!), discovering Asia and her cat Misha ;)

	<div id="krogh" style="position: relative;">
		<div class="prez-title">
			<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;">Nicolas aka Krogh</span>
			<br>Web Developer
		</div>
		
		<div class="prez-bottom">
			<div class="prez-top">
				<div class="prez-content">
					Krogh has many nicknames… the Rocket, Buzz or Superman ;) Ok we have to admit, he is the genius developer behind so many things on Magelo such as the WoW database, the Model viewer, Magelo Sync, the Inventory Tool, the Item Comparison, the Web Bar and much more!
<br><br>
Krogh is not only the best developer ever, he is also always looking forward and coming up with new innovations that could contribute to the community. Part of the team since 2007, he started by developping the WoW channel and jumped into the Rift during its beta to quickly work on new features for this community. If Magelo is what it is today, it is a lot thanks to his involvement, talent and faith in what we do.
<br><br>
Gamer in the soul, he started playing WoW and Rift since day one and try any MMO that comes out. When is not developing new stuff for Magelo he learns to speak Chinese and enjoys PS3 games or good movies.

			<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px;">Roy aka Royson</span>
			<br>Web Designer
		</div>
		
		<div class="prez-bottom">
			<div class="prez-top">
				<div class="prez-content">
					Royson is Magelo talented in-house web designer who joined the team in 2008. He is behind a lot of beautiful stuff on the website such as the Flash feature tours, the Signatures and Avatars, Magelo Sync, the Magelo comic,... and of course the illustrations of this page, really close to the reality, just in case you have some doubt ;)
<br><br>
In a short time, he gave Magelo a new stunning and fun look! We are really lucky to count him in the team and so thankful for the excellent job he is doing every day since day one!
<br><br>
Outside Magelo, Royson cultivates its passion for design through many other projects. He also likes to play xbox360, PS3 games or various MMO including WoW and Lineage2.

			<br>Web Developer
		</div>
		
		<div class="prez-bottom">
			<div class="prez-top">
				<div class="prez-content">
					Seekay joined Jelan and Nicolas on the development front in 2008 to reinforce the team! He took the lead on many projects such as the awesome Gear Planner and the difficult challenge of figuring out and maintaining the accuracy of WoW statistics :) 
<br><br>
He is a devoted WoW gamer playing many characters such as <a href="http://wow.magelo.com/en/profile/1857891" target=blank>Seekay</a>. Developing cool stuff for Magelo is (I quote) “the dream job”.  His involvement and skills bring a lot to Magelo, as well as his cool Canadian style ;) 
<br><br>
At the beginning of 2011 he decided to move back to his home country, to follow new adventures. He stays really involved in Magelo and continues to maintain and develop cool stuff for the site! We thank him a lot for everything :)

			<br>Community Manager
		</div>
		
		<div class="prez-bottom">
			<div class="prez-top">
				<div class="prez-content">
					Erycil joined Magelo in 2008 for 3 years to help and guide the community on the website and the games :) Erycil was working closely with the dev team testing a lot of features and he was also behind the writting of news and other miscellaneous content. You can still meet him time to time in the forums - always available to help!
<br><br>
Since the WoW beta, Erycil proudly plays several characters such as <a href="http://wow.magelo.com/en/profile/1773235" target=blank>Ryuune</a> on Aman'Thul. His contribution to Magelo is just equal as his unconditional love for WoW! He collects real-size epic swords under his bed or other posters and figurines ;) He also enjoys playing FPS and role-playing games and loves reading Manga such as Kenichi!

			<br>Web Developer
		</div>
		
		<div class="prez-bottom">
			<div class="prez-top">
				<div class="prez-content">
					Kimahry started working with his big brother Jelan at the very beginning of Magelo to take care of the tech support ;) Then he helped on the development side working on many different projects.
<br><br>
Kimahry is a devoted MMO gamer. He started with Everquest then moved on World of Warcraft, Aion, Everquest 2 and recently Rift. He often returns on Azeroth to plays his favorite character <a href="http://wow.magelo.com/en/profile/1500001" target=blank>Azüla</a>. 
<br><br>
In 2010 he moved on new horizon to develops his programming skills. His knowledge of the MMO scene is for sure a great help and he continues to share with us his ideas and suggestion to improve Magelo :) When he is not playing on his computer, Kimahry learns Japanese and jogs on the beautiful streets of Besançon, where he lives in France ;)

Xane plays WoW casually but is more an outdoor person ;) Whenever he has the time he bikes and plays basketball but he also enjoys playing Counterstrike with the team from time to time :)
