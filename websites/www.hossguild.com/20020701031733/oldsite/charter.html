                  the Prospective Members section. Any member can sponsor a prospective member. To sponsor
                  someone, the member will make a post to the new members private forum. If no outright
                  objections are voiced in a 2 day period, that person will become a trial member. <br>
                  <br>
                  The length of the trial will be determined on a case by case basis. In general is the
                  person is well knows to a majority of the guild the trial will be very short. In cases
                  where the person is not well known, the trial will be longer. In general most trials will
                  last 2-3 weeks. During the trial period the prospective member will be guilded, and remain
                  guilded. They will be given access to the private guild message forum. They will not have
                  access to the new member discussion forum. During the trial members are encouraged to post
                  their thoughts regarding the prospective member to the new member forum. If a situation
                  arises where it is clear the trial member would not be a good addition to Hoss, the trial
                  will be ended prematurely. <br>
                  <br>
                  At the end of the trial the officers will make a final decision as to whether to make the
                  trial member a permanent member. If granted permanent member status, all threads
                  pertaining to said person will be deleted from the new member forum and they will be given
                  access to the forum so they can become involved in the discussion of future prospective
                  members. <br>
                  <br>
                  If a situation arises where a conflict between 2 or more members cannot be resolved by the
                  parties in involved, the officers will intervene. Should the officers decide that the best
                  thing for the guild is the deguilding of one of the parties involved, that will be done. </small></span></p>

                  <p><span id="verdana"><small>The guild policy on loot is divided by category. The
                  categories are defined by how many people are required to obtain an item. So while a
                  particular item may be extremely rare, if it only requires a single group to obtain, it is
                  considered common loot. <br>
                  <br>
                  Distribution of common loot (i.e. Hierophant cloak, bloodpoint, etc) will be entirely up
                  to those people involved in hunt. Uncommon loot (i.e. most pieces of planar armor) will be
                  distributed by a rotation. The individual classes will decide on the order of the
                  rotation, and be responsible for maintaining the rotation. Exceptions, such as a person
                  missing a single piece, etc, are up the class to decide about. Absence will not result in
                  you getting extra pieces when you are present (i.e. you are third on list to receive an
                  item. You miss a hunt and the 2 people above you each get 2 items. The next hunt you are
                  there, you will be up for the first item, but do not get 3 items in a row to bring you up
                  to parity). <br>
                  <br>
                  If a problem arises in distribution of uncommon loot, the officers will make final
                  decision. Distribution of rare loot (God/dragon/planar BPs/robes) will be done by the
                  officers. This decision will take into account need, participation, usefulness, etc. In
                  most cases the decision will be made beforehand (i.e. before a known dragon raid). While
                  the officers will make all final decisions about all rare loot (even in cases where there
                  is overwhelming agreement as to who should get item, in order to maintain consistency),
                  this decision will not be made in a vacuum. Rare loot distribution can be discussed on the
                  guild's private message board. <br>
                  <br>
                  All rare loot is considered guild loot. This means that if a person gets an item they are
                  expected to use the item. If a time comes when said person no longer needs/wants, or
                  regularly uses the item, it will be redistributed just as if it were a new item (decided
                  by the officers). This does not apply to items being used part time (i.e. shaman using
                  Nagafen hammer sometimes, paw other times...or warrior switching between 1h and 2h weapons
                  as situation dictates). It is also expected that valuable items obtained with a group
                  (i.e. common or uncommon as defined above) not be traded away for personal benefit if
                  other members of the group that helped obtain said item, still want/need it. <br>
                  <br>
                  No lotto's will be used for uncommon or rare loot...ever. </small></span></p>

                  they will be considered equally for all common/uncommon loot. For the most part they will
                  not be considered for rare loot, except in cases where said person has grouped with the
                  guild many times, showing a pattern of participation that justifies being considered. This
                  means they will be added to the rotation for planar armor, etc. Where they go in the
                  rotation is up to the individual classes to decide. <br>
                  <br>
                  In cases where the event is more a multiguild event, the person coordinating the event
                  will discuss loot distribution with the other guild. All rare loot that comes to HOSS will
                  still be distributed by the officers (i.e. it is decided to zone lotto an CoF from
                  Talendor, if a Hoss member wins lotto, it still goes to the person decided upon by the
                  officers, regardless of who won the lotto). </small></span></p>

                  with respect at all times. Problems arise when people make off the cuff remarks in
                  guildchat. There is often more to a situation than is readily apparent, and unless you are
                  sure you know exactly what is going on, members should refrain from making derogatory
                  comments about other members in guild chat. If a member has a problem with another member,
                  it should be addressed with an officer. <br>
                  <br>
                  'Bashing' other guilds in guildchat is highly discouraged. Regardless of what you think of
                  another guild, their methods, tactics, etc, it never accomplishes anything to talk
                  derogatively of an entire guild. This is not to say you can't have personal opinions, but
                  it is expected that members keep those opinions out of guildchat. <br>
                  <br>
                  Topics discussed on our private forums are generally not to be seen by or told to any non
                  guild members. Compromising the security of the guild's website and/or private forums will
                  lead to disciplinary action and may lead to deguilding if the intent was malicious in
                  nature. <br>

                  No posts should be made regarding Hoss' accomplishments to other message boards. We will
