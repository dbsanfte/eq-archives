          Telor Strifesage of Karana sent in the location coordinates for Sulgar

          I received many <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">e-mails</a> concerning 
          the spawn time of the Ice Comet Quest rods. Some e-mails saying one 
          hour and some saying one minute. With the differences between the times 
          I decided to call upon a good friend to verify this for me. Here is 
          what he found out: The first rod he picked up and waited only one minute 
          before it respawned. He picked that rod up also. After he picked up 
          the second rod, he waited 35 minutes and no respawn. So he zoned and 
          came back in to find the rod there. He repeated this process twice so 
          it seems that zoning played a part in the spawn process of it all. This 
          should not be a problem due to the fact that the rods are LORE NO DROP, 
          but if the individual was to sit in the zone after he picked up the 
          rod... you might be waiting a while for the next spawn. Huge thank you 
          to Keiote' of Xegony for confirming this!</p>

          Getting lots of confirmations on the Charm Bug.... and I mean LOTS. 
          I have taken it upon myself to e-mail Brad McQuaid concerning the bug 
          so hopefully this may be looked into. One viewer even took the time 
          to send in a picture of his inventory showing what exactly happens. 
          Keep in mind that pictures of your e-mail will do nothing to convince 
          Verant that you were subject to the bug due to the fact that it is far 
          to easy to edit a pic. All you can do is leave the item where it is, 
          petition and wait... and wait... and wait. Thanks to Glinlor Stormweaver 
          for sending in the screenshot.</p>

          Concerning the disappearing melee item while charmed bug: Had another 
          viewer send in e-mail stating that this has happened to a member of 
          a party they were in during an expedition in Guk. Their party members 
          Black Tome turned into a beaded necklace of some sort. The GM could 
          not do anything for there was no way to prove they had a book before 
          hand. This was due to the person removing the necklace from their melee 
          slot. If they were to leave the necklace in the melee spot (which is 
          impossible for a player to put in the melee slot), the GM may have well 
          of fixed the situation. So, if this happens to you, don't touch a thing.. 
          simply petition the situation. Thanks to Soren of The Rathe for the 
          confirm. </p>

          While in Misty Thicket, causing havoc with the locals by killing their 
          guards, I came across a Gnome with a unique item as well as a name that 
          I found hilarious. Ichiban Anklebiter (damn that's classic) was holding 
          a shovel in his hand for a weapon. He was even kind enough to give me 
          one! Now I beg of you not to go asking him for one.. he has a game to 
          play too. Just go check it out upon the <a href="../weapons/weapons.htm" target="main">Weapons</a> 
          page under Blunt Weapons. I have the stat pic and a screenshot of him 
          wielding it. Thank you Ichiban!</p>

          <font color="#FFFFFF">Bug Report</font>: Seems that if you do not wield 
          a weapon in your main melee slot but hold an item such as a Glowing 
          Black Stone or a Black Tome of Silver Runes and you become charmed by 
          an NPC, the item has a chance of vanishing completely from your inventory 
          when the charmer throws you into hand to hand combat. The person that 
          reported it lost a Glowing Black Stone due to being charmed. Thanks 
          to Vanya of Quellious for the info.. sorry to hear of your loss.<br>

          I have been getting conflicting reports that faction does and does not 
          take place in the Ice Comet Quest. I will try to log on at lunch and 
          verify for myself. (I have killed a few Halas guards.. so that should 
          be a good test). I have not been told if the NPC's attack or just wont 
          speak to you if your faction is not good with them.</p>

          A viewer sent me this reply he received from GZ concerning the balance 
          issues with the classes, Wizards in particular. I apologize to the submitter 
          for taking so long to post this, but I wished to get GZ's permission 
          to do so. So, here it is in all its glory.... please take all discussion 
          to the Rant message board. Thanks!</p>
        <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">Geoffrey Z</font>: &quot;I honestly feel that 
          most spell casting classes are pretty well balanced. Wizards complain 
          a lot that they don't have the versatility at higher levels - but I 
          also get an equal number of e-mails from Druids, saying that they wish 
          that they were more specialized. They feel that people would rather 
          have a Wizard then them - since a Wiz can do more damage, and a Cleric 
          is better at healing. At this point, I feel that most magic classes 
          are very well balanced - we won't be changing much in the future with 
          what spells / the power of spells that the casting classes get. Most 
          people won't be happy with this - they feel that their particular class 
          is underpowered. But for every class we tweak, other classes feel that 
          they are now worse (we up the Wizard damage, give them new spells, then 
          Druids feel that they are no longer needed. We let Wizards have DoTs, 
          and then Necros and Shamans say they aren't needed, etc.). We are in 
          a pretty good balance state right now... Geoffrey C. Zatkin&quot;</p>

          Had a couple emails and I saw some discussion about the Glowing Stein/Stein 
          of Moggok. Just to clear things up, when the Glowing Stein is changed 
          into the Stein of Moggok, it does keep all of its attributes (Dex, Int, 
          HP, Disease) as well as being a 1H Blunt Weapon.</p>

          Looks like as of last night, both the Glowing Stein and the Cuburt Quests 
          are fine. I have not had a chance to log in for myself to see if there 
          was a patch last night. I will wait for viewer email concerning the 
          status of the Glowing Stein quest today.</p>
        <p>On a side note, a few months back I recieved an email stating that 
          the Flowing Black Robe had been found within Runnyeye from a viewer. 
          This person has been getting flooded with in game tells concerning it. 
          His name has been removed from the info due to the fact that he just 
          emailed me stating that he never did send such info. So, if you have 
          his name written down... stop pestering the poor guy. The Runnyeye info 
          is false.</p>

          Quest <i>may</i> have already been pulled from his server (Verant removed 
          the Bartender in Freeport). He also included that upon his server nothing

        <p> - 11:30am PST<br>
          Recieving alot of emails asking my further thoughts upon Asheron's Call. 
          I posted this to the General Message Board a couple days ago and I'll 
          post it here so you can read.</p>
        <p>&quot;What I found to be the greatest aspect of being a caster in AC 
          was the thinking that went along with getting your spells. You dont 
          need to goto your vendor and buy the spell.. you go get components (much 
          like the research practice in EQ.. yet in AC they are purchasable from 
          the magic vendors), once you get the components you can create your 
          spells if you know the right ingredients and order they go in. Now.. 
          in game right now, the higher level players are not telling their ingredients 
          unless you trade for info.. but you know what, Jodowein (this was a 
          person that I posted under) is right.. there will be sites that will 
          list this info quickly. Then again, I have also been told that what 
          works for one mage may not work for another.. so that spells will be 
          totally user specific. (Kinda nice to see a spell that only you can 
          cast). </p>
        <p>As for the Graphics.. not that great at all. But also keep in mind 
          that this is a BETA. In most betas, the graphic enhancements come last. 
          So from the way it is now, I have a feeling that it may have the ability 
          to surpass EQ.. even with their lame D3D. (This may be rivaled again 
          when the expansion for EQ comes out and we all get more polygons... 
          just wait to see). </p>
        <p>The best thing I noticed.. NO ZONES. You computer 'reads ahead' for 
          the landscape and loads them as you run. The more you play, the faster 
          the game will become due to it caching all of the graphics. The closest 
          thing to a zone is called a 'portal'. The neat thing about portals is 
          that you can still chat while in one.. you don't sit there with your 
          computer locked up wondering if you are going to be looking at your 
          login screen or desktop anytime soon. =) </p>
        <p>All in all, the game has great promise. For a game slated to be released 
          in December.. they have quite a in depth game in their hands. Who wouldn't 
          with the financial backing of Microsoft capital. So my final note is.. 
          don't sweat trying to get into AC, If EQ would focus on quests, like 
          the name suggests, they would have no worry about people defecting. 
          Damn I hope a developer at Verant reads that.&quot;</p>
        <p>Now for some additional thoughts. When I beta tested for Everquest, 
          I was simply blown away. Graphics, user interface, size of the world, 
          etc., all amazed me. When I fired up Asheron's Call for the first time, 
          I did not have that feeling that Everquest gave me. Everquest still 
          has the ability to pull me in and make me feel like I am actually within 
          the world... this is something Asheron's Call did not do for me. Keep 
          in mind this is just my opinion and many others out there may feel different. 
          Don't judge the game just from my point of view, wait until you can 
          play it for yourself before making a decision. -<a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">

          Well.. headed to off to get some shuteye for the night. Spent my evening 
          and morning playing Asheron's Call. Don't worry.. I'm not going anywhere. 
          I love Everquest and I enjoy keeping this site. But I must say that 
          the research of spells in Asheron's Call is simply incredible. Thanks 
          to a good friend from EQ named Cypren, he helped coach me thru the beginnings 
          of my teachings. I took a <a href="../screenpics/GraffeAC.jpg" target="_blank">pic</a>

          I've been in contact with Geoffrey Z (Lead Spell Designer/Programmer 
          for Verant) as of late and I thought some of you might find our conversation 
          of interest. This is concerning our Resist problems we as Wizards face:<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Graffe:</font> The largest complaint 
          I receive is our +6 level damage cap. This is hard for me to respond 
          to the viewers with due to the fact that I don't have the exact numbers 
          on why this happens. What they are complaining about is that if we cast 
          on a beast that is of 6 levels higher than us, we get a full resist. 
          This greatly reduces our use in a higher class group. I do know that 
          when I fire upon a red and it resists the spell fully, it still takes 
          that resist as a full hit and adds me to its hatred list. Here is the 
          scenario that I have personally experienced. I cast Thunder Strike on 
          a mob (which would normally do 250 damage at my current level) and it 
          resists the cast fully. If I do not wait for the tanks to raise its 
          hatred level to them and I cast it again for a full resist, it will 
          come directly for me. From higher level wizards, I hear that the Fire 
          Giants within Solusek resist everything they cast (that comes from two 
          wizards, one level 49 the other 50). I was told by my level 49 contact 
          that this is due to an exploit that could be taken advantage of. My 
          suggestion is that the resist cap is removed, but do not let us hit 
          for our full damage... lessen the damage on tougher creatures so that 
          we can once again be useful within a group. Not only used for evacuation 
          purposes. </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">Geoffrey Z: </font>It actually isn't 
          a 6 lvl cap - it is >5 lvls OR more than 1.2 of the casters level - 
          so at higher levels, you can effect things 7-9 levels above you. Anything 
          which falls into the above catagory gets a much better saving throw 
          - not 100%, but much better. This was done for balance reasons - most 
          classes use indirect magic to get around it. The Wizard does have trouble 
          in that they do not get any good indirect magic (healing, damage shields, 
          quickness spells, etc.). It is one of the downsides of playing a Wizard. 
          Have a good one. :)</p>

          Thought I was going to be the first to have this for you.. but my contact 
          fell thru. EQ'Lizer was the first to get the stat pic of this new robe. 
          I wont post until I get the info the honest way.. but here are the stats 
          upon the Crimson Robe of Alendine that is found upon Cazic Thule within 
          Fear:<br>
          <br>
          AC: 12 <br>
          DEX: +15 <br>
          INT: +15 <br>
          HP: +50 <br>
          MANA: +50<br>

          I meant to post this information a while back but apparently it skipped 
          right by me. It seems that if you take the two different Runes of Fulguration 
          to a vendor and try to sell them, they will be worth two different amounts. 
          The lower priced rune is for the lower research spells and the higher 
          priced is for the higher research spells. Many people sent this info 
          in and I don't have all of thier names in front of me to give credit 
          for. I all can say is thank you and I'm sure the rest of the Wizzies 
          out there thank you also. I will have some minor item additions later 
          today. Have a great morning... - Graff&euml;</p>

          Received an e-mail from Telor Strifesage of Karana with the stats on 
          the Cryosilk Robe. This is the two-tone brown robe found upon a spider 
          within Fear. Here are the known stats:</p>
        <p>AC 11<br>
          DEX +9<br>
          STA +13<br>
          INT +13<br>
          Mana +35</p>
        <p>I have been in contact with a few people that I know of that have this 
          robe in their possession. Now to see which one wants the recognition 
          for a stat/screen pic. =)</p>
