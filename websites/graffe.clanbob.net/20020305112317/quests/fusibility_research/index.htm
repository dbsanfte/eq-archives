      <b>Makil Rargon says</b> 'Greetings. I am Makil Rargon, an esteemed assistant 
      to the great wizard [Al'Kabor]. What can I help you with? </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'who is alkabor'<br>
      <b>Makil Rargon says</b> 'Al'Kabor is the most powerful wizard on all of 
      Norrath. He is currently back to his Combine Empire research. Being his 
      most trusted assistant, he assigned me to follow up on his fusibility [research] 
      findings. Do you have any information to offer? </p>
    <p><b>You say</b>, 'what research'<br>
      <b>Makil Rargon says</b> 'Ah. Yes, his fusibility research. Al'Kabor has 
      been studying the melting point of minerals. Here. Take this journal. It 
      explains what fusibility is. Over the last few years, he has conducted several

      <p><i><font size="1">Part 1: What is Fusibility?</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">By nature, most minerals have some point at which they 
        can be melted. In order to determine what that point is, fusibility tests 
        must be conducted. Being a master of the scientific art of wizardry, I, 
        of course, have mastered this process. When exposing a mineral ore to 
        a controlled amount of heat and other factors, it slowly shrinks, forming 
        a liquid base of particles.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">Over the last few years, I managed to collect several 
        samples of ore that produce a unique output when subjected to these fusibility 
        tests.</font></i></p>

      <b>Makil Rargon says</b> 'An ore is considered fusible if it can be melted.

      <p><i><font size="1">Fusible Coral Ore:</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">Back while unraveling the secrets behind the demise 
        of the Kedge, I confronted Phinigel Autropos, the last survivor of his 
        kind. While speaking with him and enduring his ill-tempered threats and 
        warnings toward me, I noticed coral-like ore on the reef of his domain. 
        I managed to collect a few samples of this fascinating mineral.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">This ore is composed of coral reef shells, another 
        substance, not yet defined, and is tightly compressed by the water of 
        the Kedge Keep.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">Fusible Earthen Ore:</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">When those bumbling gnomes destroyed the Hatch releasing 
        Yael and Dartain, minerals from the Plane of the Underfoot dispersed outward 
        onto the surrounding area.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">This form of earthen ore is one of the hardest substances 
        currently existing on Norrath and is the source of the earthen golems 
        and elementals who lurk in the Hole.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">Fusible Igneous Ore:</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">I spent many months researching upon the continent 
        of Kunark. I came across a unique form of lava in the Skyfire Mountains. 
        These mountains have several dorman volcanoes filled with lava waiting 
        to erupt. It was around one of these volcanoes where I found fusible igneous 
        ore.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">When volcanin lava cools it forms into a hard-form 
        mineral. This mineral is by far one of the hottest minerals on Norrath 
        and requires extreme heat to melt.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">Fusible Velium Ore:</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">Although he is usually a bothersom individual, the 
        dwarven warrior Thubr Axebringer has assisted me with obtaining samples 
        of velium ore. He managed to find a few rare pieces of it in the Western 
        Wastes of Velious.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">Velium ore is the most unique ore I have found so far. 
        Its composition relies heavily on the coldness of the area it is found. 
        The cooler the area, the more tightly compressed it si likely to be. In 
        addition, the more compressed the ore is, the greater the likelihood of 
        it being useful in spell research.</font></i></p>

      the artifact, if you are willing to help me complete a [fusibility test], 
      I can offer you another item of great strength against the elements. </p>

      <p><i><font size="1">Part 3: The Experiments</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">Continuing my research on the fusibility of the fusible 
        coral, earthen, igneous, and velium ores, I have conducted several experiments. 
        By mixing the velium ore with the other three, I discovered quite an extraordinary 
        magical compound. When cooled, the velium caused the compound to expand 
        and quickly harden - the outcome, a product that is uniquely resistant 
        to the elements.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">In order to make use of this newly created substance, 
        I performed the experiment again. This time, while reciting a few incantations 
        that I have been working on. I then quickly poured the compound into a 
        mold of a scepter while chilling it. With the power of the chilled fusible 
        ore compound and the spell incantation, I managed to create quite an unusual 
        scepter artifact.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">When held by a wizard of great power, not unlike myself 
        of course, the magical energy of the scepter flows throughout the mind 
        expanding the intelligence while providing a greater protection from the 
        elements.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">Needless to say, I would only entrust a most loyal 
        assistant with the safeguarding of such a powerful artifact.</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font size="1">At this time, Makil Rargon is the only assistant whom 
        I am sure I can trust to continue on with my fusibility research. I have 
        authorized him to release my findings regarding this study to others since 
        I'm positive that only Makil Rargon and I, myself, can duplicate the process.</font></i></p>
