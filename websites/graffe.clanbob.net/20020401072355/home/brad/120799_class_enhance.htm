        <p align="center">The following was taken from alt.games.everquest which 
          started as the newly implemented Necromancer spell &quot;Summon Corpse&quot;. 
          Brad McQuaid took the time to reply to the person and give his and the 
          Dev Team's rundown on all of the class changes that they could think 
          of. Keep in mind that he does say some things were missed.</p>

          Indeed, given the level of malice you and the rest of the nerfing team 
          have shown for the players over the last several patches at least, I 
          find it hard to believe that this spell will survive for long on the 
          live servers in its current form--if it makes it there at all.</p>

          </b>I and the rest of the 'nerfing team' put 
          the following document together listing both enhancements and 'nerfs' 
          we've made to the game since launch. And while we probably forgot some 
          things, both negative and positive (please let us know and I'll update 
          the document), I think it puts in perspective the ratio of positive 
          vs. negative changes to the game we've made. I also feel it heartily 
          invalidates the assertion that we are out to make the game harder or 
          to have players advance slower overall, or that 'all we do is nerf'.</p>
        <p>The following is broken down by class, and then addresses those changes 
          made that affect the whole game. Changes we feel are positive from just 
          about any perspective are denoted with a '+', and those some players 
          might consider a 'nerf', but that we felt were important for the long 
          term health of the game, are denoted with a '-'.</p>
        <p>(again, I'm sure we've forgotten some things, both '+' and '-'; please 
          feel free to comment and add items).</p>
