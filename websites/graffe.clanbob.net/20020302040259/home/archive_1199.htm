          <i>&quot;....I, with my guild have fought and killed him many times. 
          He drops level 49 research items for wizard, enchanter, mage, and necro, 
          as well as black saphires, jacinth, and daimond. I have found darkness 
          works much better than snare, coupled with fear and a few pets and he 
          is easy. He hits for 137x4 on occasion. He is not exactly a hard mob, 
          he has almost no magic resist. A level 49 necro can solo him fairly 
          easily as long as fear and darkness keeps up...&quot;</i><br>

          let you know I'm back and sifting through the e-mails. I ventured over 
          to the message board to archive some of it and came across one person 
          that was a bit upset at me leaving. At first I started to laugh and 
          then reading further, I couldn't figure out if the person was serious 
          or not... but if they were, I apologize for leaving all of you with 
          no news or updates. One must put life matters as a priority sometimes 
          and this one was a great cause. Congratulations to Gil and Shannon on

          of the Allizewsaur that was posted on Wednesday, Dracehnis sent in this 
          info on the fight and the loot:<br>
          <i>&quot;... I was playing Dracehnis.. Aganihm (Piktureetacer) is a 
          good friend of mine and we had him make a dwarf simply to take pics.. 
          Alot of people asked us what we got off him and told us that they saw 
          the pic on your site .. We were not done killing it yet . We got mainly 
          nothing But we got a reserch item for a lvl 49 necro pet.. That is what 
          we had come for. We killed it 6 times total .. With a group of 1 lvl 
          50 and 2 49s the 49th lvls ger pretty good exp after 6 kills i had almost 
          gotten a half bub exp.. The spawn time is 2 min unless a place holder 
          spawns, stay to the out side of the island and keep buffed.. Its a very 
          good idea to have pets and snare our group consister of a necro, shaman 
          and druid. If you have pets DONT ROOT this guy hits for 117 at normal 
          and pets will die fast snare and run is the best way... If you try it 
          any other way i dont know how easy it will be .. &quot;</i><br>
          Thanks Dracehnis!</p>

          controlling some god like birds getting revenge maybe for the Holiday 
          I'm not sure. I was trying to fight them along with about 40 others 
          at the city. I took a few screenshots of the Aviak Avengers, Commandos 
          and Spirit birds that I thought you might like to post. Sorry if it 
          took a long time to recieve these. The GM's were even shouting back 
          at all the talk coming out of the higher level players. Cause the birds 
          ran like they had 5x the speed of a SOW and nobody could really catch

          <img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Here's some good reading 
          for you. NeuroS T'zzorM of Xegony created a list of questions for Geoffrey 
          Zatkin (GZ). These are questions and topics that are always abundant 
          on the major message boards. If you all can take your comments to the 
          Rant Board, my e-mail box will thank you greatly ::smiles:: Here is 
          a copy of the e-mail:<br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">Q</font>: Have the mana/damage efficiency linked 
          to the level of the wizard. There by increasing all DD spells useable 
          by a wizard at that level to the mana/damage efficiency of the wizards 
          largest DD spell.an example: At level 50 IC and rend both have a mana/damage 
          efficiency of 2.8. I am suggesting that all DD from 1 to 50 be increased 
          to that efficiency rating. That would increase the max damage of Shock 
          of Ice (level 34 spell) from 320 to 448 for a level 50 wizard.<br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">GZ</font>: If the wizard was level 28 with a top 
          spell of frost shock with a mana/damage efficiency rating of 1.7. Therefore 
          all lower level spells would have a mana/damage rate of 1.7. We specificially 
          designed our system to do the opposite. Otherwise, why would you ever 
          want another flame spell after level 1, since that one would upgrade 
          as you gained in levels. Instead, we have spells that grow with you 
          to a certain point, but then cap. This lets you move on to the next 
          more powerful spell when you advance a level. </p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Q</font>: Also with this change the restance 
          rates of lower level spells would need to be placed on a sliding scale. 
          So the lower the spell rank less chance of the mob resisting the spell.<br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">GZ</font>: We already have a bit of this built 
          in. If you use a lower level spell, your chance of fizzle is almost 
          0, you do that spells max damage, and we knock a bit off of the creatures 
          resistance. Not a lot, but a bit. </p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Q</font>: Give the wizards DD spells an across 
          the board increase in damage. We are advertised as the "Masters of Damage" 
          yet at various levels other pure casters and Hybrid casters can do as 
          much or more damage then us.<br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">GZ</font>: DD damage? Not really. Wizards have 
          [1] Better spell casting times [2] better spell recasting times [3] 
          a better mana to damage ratio (always) [4] more damage per DD spell 
          then any other DD spell of the same rank. Remember, this is DD - not 
          DoT, Bolt, etc. </p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Q</font>: Perhaps raise the resistance cap for 
          wizards from 6 or 1.2 to 8 or 1.3. This would allow a lower level wizards 
          to be of use against the harder mobs, where they normally would not.<br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">GZ</font>: The one big weakness of the Wizard 
          is their lack of indirect offense. This can be overcome with help - 
          a Bard, Enchanter, Magician or Shaman can lower the resistance of monsters, 
          making it easier to effect a red. Wizards can also quest for a magic 
          staff that helps with this.</p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Q</font>: Either totally remove or add upgrades 
          to our one and only damage shield spell. This most have been meant as 
          a joke... One damage shield for 2 pt that last what 20 seconds and no 
          upgrades... <br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">GZ</font>: Wizards were not slotted to have gotten 
          Damage Shields. If I had known how many people would bitch about it, 
          it would have been removed in early beta.</p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Q</font>: Revert to Root line of spells back 
          to there former power. I can't believe they did this to us. I would 
          rather trade in all of my Root serious spells for the 1st level Druid 
          Snare spell which is a hundred times more effective. You wanted us to 
          group up and then you complain that the root spell is to powerful in 
          group combats... Next our DD will be to powerful. Did you bother to 
          think that I may have to depend upon that root spell to hold a wandering 
          monster so I can zone???<br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">GZ</font>: Not sure what you are talking about. 
          Root hasn't changed in a long, long time. I even doublechecked with 
          the AI guy - no changes in how Root works vs monsters. If you are talking 
          about PvP, it got changed a tiny bit - and we playtested it a lot to 
          a level that we felt was balanced.</p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Q</font>: And lastly has anyone else noticed 
          that whilst wizards don't get a stun effect off there DD spells, all 
          other pure casters get stun effects(enchanters at level 1) much earlier, 
          others slow their opponent down or gain life whilst doing damage?<br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">GZ</font>: There are two types of stun spells 
          in EQ - knock out of casting stuns (what wizards get on most of their 
          spells) and stun spells that actually keep the creature from doing anything 
          (wizards get 2 of this type). As for "all other casters" - Clerics & 
          Enchanters get a stun, Druids get a knock out of casting stun that only 
          works outdoors, Shamans & Necromancers & Magicians get none. I might 
          be forgetting something, but that is what comes immediatly to mind. 
        </p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Q</font>: Jipp, Yes I want to be the most powerful 
          damage spell caster in the game. That is what I was lead to believe 
          the wizard class was! The title of Master of Offensive Magic and the 
          line about having no rivals in this area kind of sums it up. Wizards 
          were suppose to be the Masters of spell damage, we don't have any cool 
          pets, no Buffs, no DOTs, no Debuffs, no Heals, no worth while Damage 
          Shield. Those where are sacrificed to concentrate wizards in the fields 
          of Damage and teleportation. We can teleport all over Norrath and the 
          planes, to bad we are out gunned by other caster at our own speciality.<br>
          <font color="#FFFFFF">GZ</font>: Wizards get what is advertised - the 
          most powerful direct damage in the game. For this, they give up a lot 
          of other things. <br>
          A Magician with a pet can outdamage a Wizard. A Necromancer with DoT's 
          and a Skeleton will eventually outdamage a Wizard. However, with just 
          direct damage, a Wizard will outdamage everybody, hands down. They do 
          more damage in less time then any other class. They also get a few nifty 
          things that most other classes don't - Teleport being one of the major 
          ones. Wizards are good at DD, AoE, Teleport, self protection (shieldskin, 
          resistant skin, etc), Root and the occasional stun. Wizards also get 
          3 types of damage spells (magic, fire and cold), which means that they 
          can effect almost every monster in every zone of the game. They also 
          get their DD spells upgraded every level - no other class gets that. 
          This means that the Wizard always has access to their most powerful 
          spell at every spell rank. <br>
          Now, this isn't going to be popular, but... I've read a lot of discussion 
          boards. Every class asks for things to be added, and every class thinks 
          that they are the least powerful. Go read the Necromancer or Magician 
          boards - or the Shaman or Cleric. Pick one and read - lots of suggestions 
          on how to make the classes more balanced towards their class.<br>
          EQ classes are not going to change from what they are now. We will add 
          a few spells and little abilities as we go along, but nothing that will 
          effect the balance of the classes or balance of the game. If you like 
          Wizards as they are, you will continue to like them. If you think Wizards 
          aren't that powerful, or you like the style of play of another class, 
          realize that you may want to switch to that class. <br>
          I feel that Wizards are well balanced. I have come to this conclusion 
          from over a year of playing a Wizard. I have high level characters of 
          every spell casting class in EQ. From a balance point of view, in my 
          personal opinion, Wizards are well balanced. This is an opinion, and 
          you may disagree. But from personal play experience, Wizards are pretty 
          damn cool.<br>

          on the sharks that inhabit Erud's Crossing (Ice Comet Quest):<br>
          <i>&quot;I'm sure you've recieved mixed reports on the sharks in eruds 
          crossing near the rod spawn well here is what my observations have been. 
          there are at least 2 types of sharks down there. however only one type 
          can see invis they are called diseased sharks. they need to be avoided, 
          however luckily these are much less common than the average killer shark. 
          also a breif notice, the water is extremely dark and you can't see more 
          than ten feet in front of you so it is very easy to get lost. i would 
          suggest putting all of your armor and everything else you have in the 
          bank before going after this rod, because after almost three hours of 
          searching i have yet to find my body but i've found the rod three times. 
          also lost almost a level looking for it. I'm not haveing a good day.&quot;</i><br>
          Andrew is correct I get LOTS of e-mail concerning this matter. So much, 
          I could create a whole mini web site about it. Nobody has concrete evidence 
          on what makes them attack. One person gets attacked while invisible 
          and others do not. I call it a roll of the dice and can only tell anyone 
          that has not done this part of the quest to be very careful. I personally 
          had no problems whatsoever getting this rod (but it was the only one 
          that made me sweat).</p>

          admision fees by level, with items from all over. This is being run 
          by Thynfiula and Clron, with the support of their guild, the Millenium

          <i>&quot;There are two different types of Fulgration Runes. One is high

          Doing this it is said that Fulgration Runes prices were evened out. 
          Therefor the higher level rune will sell for the same amount. This was 
          a mistake, and I hear it is suppose to change. Wiether this is all true 
          or not, this is what I was told from a few people. A simple mistake

          <img src="purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="9">Today I received a reply 
          from an ongoing e-mail with a friend of mine from Xegony. His name, 
          Tanelorn Everlore, a High Elf Wizard. We had traveled together many 
          times in our 'younger' years within our characters and yet he never 
          knew that I ran this site. One day about 3 months ago he stumbled upon 
          it and wrote to me impressed and asking for a bit of help on how to 
          create his own. I had been coaching him along through e-mail when he 
          one day wrote to me why he wished to create site. It seemed that he 
          had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a type of cancer that attacks 
          the lymphoid tissues and then moves on to other organs. He was told 
          it was terminal and was given only a short while to live. He asked for 
          no pity and only wished to enjoy his remaining days doing things that 
          made his life enjoyable. The reason I am writing this is because that 
          piece of mail I received this morning was not from Tanelorn, Robert 
          Wells in real life, but it was from his mother. She wrote back to me 
          stating that Robert had passed away on November 4th, 1999. I wish to 
          hold off from updates for today and take the rest of the day off in 
          remembrance of Robert Wells, a.k.a. Tanelorn Everlore. Tanelorn, if 
          you are up there playing EQ, may none of your castings be resisted my 
          friend. You will be missed.</p>

          Hail Norrath Travelers, I am pleased to announce that after months of 

          work EverQuest Maps has finally opened it's doors in hopes of providing 

          an invaluable resource to the EverQuest community. Since it's opening 

          one week ago many players have contributed to the site's 40 maps, over 

          60 landmarks, and almost 600 items in the database. Almost every aspect 

          of the site can be discussed and commented so players can share and 

          correct information. Expect much more in the months to come as we bring 

          you information about a zone's beastery and NPC as well as Merchants. 

          I hope to see you there! <br>

          Thank you, <br>

          <i>&quot;For those of you that have accidentally lowered your faction 

          in the Temple of Solusek Ro, there is an easy way to regain the faction. 

          In Mistmoore, there is a mob called Ssynthi, which I believe drop the 

          Robe of the Keeper. If you go into the crypt in front of where he spawns, 

          there should be a flower on top of the casket. If you pick this up and 

          give it to Ssynthi, your faction with Shadowmen will go down, and your 

          faction with the Temple of Solusek Ro will go up. The flower spawns 

          very fast, so you could do this quite easily. However, I am not sure 

          if Ssynthi will attack you if you already are KoS in the Temple.&quot;</i><br>

          Thanks Merlynn!<br>

          On a side note, I do know that Ssynthi will not talk to you if the NPC's 

          in Solusek Ro will not talk to you. If this is the case, spend a lot 

          of time killing off Shadowmen or ask a group camping them if you can 

          throw in a couple damage spells here and there just to get faction (Bonds 

          of Force or non-damage spells will no longer effect faction. I've even 

          noticed that you have to do more than 'a little' damage to get a faction 

          adjustment. Your lowest level DD or AE will not always work) - Graff&euml;</p>

          updates yesterday. I found myself finally putting some quality time 

          into Everquest (something I have not been able to do for over three 

          weeks). Finished my Runescale Cloak quest and I am now one of the rare 

          ones upon Xegony that is Excellent in all 24 languages. Yipee! (please 

          don't ask me to teach you all of them, I need my game time too...hehe).

          tongues!</p>

          <i>&quot;I recently noticed something, and this has been confirmed by 

          several other wizards who tried it. When you click the manastone 4 times, 

          it erases Steelskin. You still lose the life from activating the manastone

          in concerning the Ice Comet Quest:<i><br>

          &quot;I am a level 25 wizard, and since I'd recently heard that any 

          level wizard could collect the 10 rods and create the staff of the wheel 

          I decided to give it a go myself. While trying to obtain the Erud's 

          crossing rod, which I think is definately that hardest to get, I found 

          a nice trick that might be worth trying if you have a high-ish swimming 

          skill and feel lucky. I had died 4 times trying to get the rod in Erud's 

          crossing and was close to giving up, as the killer sharks seemed to 

          be there EVERY time I took the dive, and would attack me immediately, 

          and could see through invisibility, so I decided to make one last charge. 

          There are a lot of pesky zombie sailors running around the island and 

          a few of them spawn next to the boat that is just infront of the rod. 

          As I jumped into the water a few of them attacked me, but i kept swimming, 

          and they followed me down and to my utter surprise, the killer sharks 

          started attacking the zombies instead of me, which gave me the time 

          I needed to grab the rod and swim like hell towards shore. I owe my 

          life to one of those zombies :) ....so, it may be worth while dragging 

          a few zombie sailors down after you to distract the sharks while you 

          make off with the rod. It worked for me :)<br>

          <i>&quot;I got my staff of the Wheel when I was lvl 25 as well. But 

          I asked a GM this, and a GM told me this. That the Staff of The wheel 

          has nothing to do with Research, but has a failure rate, as in, if a 

          Warrior got the stuff and combined the staff, he could get a Wheel staff, 

          although could not use it. But that same warrior could also fail. Research 

          has nothing to do with it:) Enjoy Glinlor Stormweaver 32th Circle Wizard

          sever. I would like to thank Amordred lvl 24 Druid and Sirth a lvl 35 

          Cleric for helping me get the ROD from Lower Guk. I read your post and 

          did not know I might be the lowest to have done the quest. I had no 

          problems, but lower Guk... Combining the Rods was a breeze, I even traded 

          the Star in for over 1.2 bubs of expo. Please let the world know it 

          can be done at lvl 22. Cobal lvl 23, Rathe&quot;<br>
