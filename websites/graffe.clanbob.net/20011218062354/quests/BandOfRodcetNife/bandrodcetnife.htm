      <p>This is an easy quest that can get you a great ring for pure casters 
        except for Necromancers. First of all you must get your faction to kindly 
        with the Temple of Life. I did this by giving Lashun Novashine 2 bone 
        chips at a time and paying him 2 gp for a cure disease.(Faction can be 
        raised by killing Putrid Skeletons in South Karana or by performing the 
        blessed oil quest as well as donating 2gp to Lashun) Once your faction 
        is kindly you can do the quest. Talk to Enic Rulkin by the Temple of Life 
        Pool within Qeynos (he is usually glitched and is swimming in the water 
        by the Koalindl fish). He will tell you of a problem that he has. It seems 
        that Frostbite (McMannus's pet dog in West Karanas) has eaten a Koalindl 
        fish. Enic must get the corpse back because even the fish's corpse is 
        still considered to be holy. Here is the trick... instead of killing Frostbite, 
        which may be too high level to kill and not always drop the fish corpse, 
        simply create a level 1 character with your friend doing the same (Shadow 
        Knights are the best for this because of Harm Touch) and go into the pool 
        by the Temple of Life and kill a Koalindl. The Koalindl will usually drop 
        its scales. Now log out the level 1 character and loot the fish with your 
        real character. I thought that this would be the best way to do the quest, 
        otherwise you would lose faction with the Temple of Life if you kill the 
        Koalindl Fish with your true character. (To be safe, gate out of the zone 
        and come back in before you do the next step. One has been killed for 
        simply looting the corpse) Now simply give the Koalindl Fish Scales to 
        Enic Rulkin, and if he cons amiable, you may get the Band of Rodcet Nife. 
        The quest booby prize is Prayer Beads.</p>
      <p>For another way to get the Koalindl fish, read on.</p>
      <p>Go to Surefall Glade (if you have acceptable faction). The druid in the 
        druid tree on<br>
        the far left will give you Nitrates if you take to them. Take the Nitrates 
        to Ak'Anon,<br>
        and give them to the Zookeeper (again, faction must be decent). He will 
        give you a Regurgitonic. From there, take the Regurgitonic, and give it 
        to Frostbite, who will<br>
        throw up the fish, which you can then take back to Enic Rulkin. In some 
        ways, this is easier than killing the fish (they seem to drop about 1 
        in 3 to 1 in 8) with an alt, in some ways harder. I was bound in Qeynos, 
        so it was easy for me to port over to Greater Faydark and do this, then 
        gate back.</p>
