      <p>I've seen a lot of questions on when to meditate during a fight and how 
        too properly use Mana. Since everyone has different tactics I can only 
        relate to you my experience and what I do and why I do it. In about 75% 
        of my groups lately when the Puller is doing Mana-checks I'll be at 80% 
        or 90% and there will almost always be a blaster-caster that is at 50% 
        or even lower. Blaster-casters in good groups should not be holding the 
        group back to meditate with the exception of the most extreme circumstances 
        (i.e. Trains and over pulls).</p>
      <p>At low levels it's easy for tanks to just want to go and go and a caster 
        who needs to meditate constantly can hold them back when doing the charge 
        for exp. As casters we need to learn how to handle this situation. They 
        need time to heal and we need time to meditate. The goal is to balance 
        those two things out and minimize downtime and thereby allow you to get 
        to more MoB killing.</p>
      <p>First and foremost, know the condition of your party. A Tanks job is 
        to go in and waste health when a battle is entered. They don't care about 
        anything except killing the 1 MoB that everyone is focused on. It's the 
        Clerics job to watch the Tanks Health and keep them alive. Both of these 
        are fairly easy jobs all things considered. The blaster-caster has the 
        hard part. You need to be able to balance your Mana with the Tanks Health 
        and with the Healers Mana. You've chosen the most intelligent class-series 
        in the game now it's time for you to prove your smarts and this is no 
        easy task!</p>
      <p>With no healers in a group the rule of thumb needs to be 1 bubble of 
        Health is equal to 2 bubbles of Mana, after all you have meditate (the 
        higher you get the greater the difference but at high levels you should 
        be in bigger groups). This will provide your group with the least amount 
        of downtime since you're healing and meditating at about the same rate. 
        A really crazy/ingenuitive caster will even try to use his own health 
        a bit thereby saving the tank a little damage (manastone concept in a 
        way).</p>
      <p>Now let's add a healer to the mix. Now there are 3 potential pools to 
        pull from. The healing Mana pool, the casting Mana pool, and health pool. 
        You may not be able to see the Healers Mana but you can almost always 
        tell when he's using Mana. It may take a few rounds of fighting to get 
        a feel for how much Mana your healer is burning but when you get the rhythm 
        down the reward is almost no downtime for your puller. A good puller will 
        bring single and double pulls most of the time. In most situations 1 or 
        2 spells a MoB is more than sufficient to do the job. All classes should 
        be doing their part; the tank is beating on the MoB, the healer is beating 
        on the MoB and healing, the blaster-caster is dropping the MoB to run 
        phase.<br>
        There are 3 phases a MoB goes through while in a fight. <br>
        Phase 1 the Attack Phase. This will be from the initial engaging to about 
        25% of the MoB's health <br>
        Phase 2 the Berzerker Phase. This is when the MoB is at about 25% health 
        and magically the damage being done to your tank goes through the roof. 
        <br>
        Phase 3 the Run phase. This is when the MoB decides it's time to leave 
        and either gets friends or just bails.</p>
      <p>Rules of thumb; there are 3 occasions when a blaster-caster should never 
        waste the Mana to cast a spell.<br>
        1.) When first engaging the MoB (there is a tactic that goes against this 
        for when there is no enchanter type in the group but this is not on tactics 
        this time)<br>
        2.) When the MoB has been beaten down enough that it is in Phase 3 the 
        run phase.<br>
        3.) When the MoB is dead. The foolproof method for interrupting a spell 
        and not casting it is to use the 'D' key and duck out of the spell. You 
        can't cast while ducking but you can regain and continue casting even 
        when you run around a bit.</p>
      <p>So since this is being written primarily by a Wizard player let's talk 
        about the blaster-casters job in your typical fight: (keep in mind I've 
        been using these tactics since the early 30's with Stuns and even before 
        then once I learned how I should be playing my class)</p>
      <p>First off never underestimate your stun line of spells. It saves everyone 
        Mana and saves the Tanks their health thereby shortening the over all 
        downtime between fights for the party as a whole. Tishan's Clash is a 
        2 second stun or about a round and a half for some MoB's. Considering 
        some of the MoB's in the game can hit up to 4 times in a round that stun 
        can save a Tank up to 400pts of damage in an optimum situation. And you 
        can meditate the Mana used for your first stun back almost completely 
        in 1 tick, so stun and sit down and meditate immediately (Ensure you are 
        out of the aggro range of the MoB too).</p>
      <p>So the MoB has been stunned a few times and it's at about half it's health 
        now what? Your Job as the blaster in the party is to drop the MoB from 
        Phase 2(Attack Phase) directly to Phase 3(Run Phase) and skip Phase 2 
        altogether. If you did this right you've been meditating in between each 
        cast so your Mana use is at a minimum up to this point. The benefit of 
        having the patience so far now pays off. You can chain cast to your hearts 
        content if need be (someone just dropped a train on you and you have to 
        drop your current MoB so you can refocus/zone/evac. and still get the 
        exp. etc). Point is you want to drop the MoB to the Run Phase and let 
        the tanks have their fun. The healer can completely heal the Tank and 
        start medding and you can start your medding also, so when the Tank finishes 
        the MoB off he's ready to pull again and everyone is nearly FM by the 
        time the next mob gets there. More often than not 2 or 3 spells per MoB 
        is more than enough in an average encounter.</p>
      <p>There will be times where you will need some extra time to meditate: 
        A train/Bad pull/or an extremely buffed resistant MoB etc. But for the 
        most part with a good puller and a good group you will be able to lay 
        down some wood non-stop!!</p>
      <p>For the nay-sayers out there my typical groups consist of: Ranger/Druid 
        (for snare etc), Paladin, Cleric/2nd Paladin or Druid/Shaman, Warrior/Rogue, 
        Enchanter/Bard/or another caster. Naturally with an Enchanter/Bard medding 
        will be increased but the formula is basically the same.</p>
      <p>On single pulls tanks will often tell the party to continue medding which 
        I never have to do. Stun is the way to go on single mobs and if the tanks 
        are well off you won't even have to do a burn on the MoB unless you have 
        plenty of Mana in which case it's still our job to drop a MoB past the 
        Berserk Phase.</p>
      <p>On multiple MoB-pulls there are many ways to approach the situation. 
        Enchanters, Bards, Wizards, Necros, and Clerics can all reduce the amount 
        of MoB's in a fight to a manageable level with a little creativity for 
        a few of the classes.</p>
      <p>Under Level 20? Things to keep in mind: Tanks don't have Ultra-Taunt 
        yet so you don't want to pull the MoB's off onto yourself. Weapons are 
        still something to be used at your level so don't be afraid to jump in 
        at the start of a fight and duke it out. The general idea here is to still 
        drop a MoB to the Run Phase and it's still best to wait until the MoB 
        is down to about half health before you blast it. When you Meditate due 
        to the larger aggro radius at lower levels you will need to be further 
        away from the actual fight before you sit down. And by all means when 
        the MoB is running and the tank is beating on his back, sit and start 
        medding. By the time of the next pull you should be good to go (GTG) for 
        the next round.</p>
      <p>Things always change and certain areas can probably be tweaked depending 
        on the situation but no matter what, the less time you spend medding, 
        the more you get to play and actually be a bonus to a group!!</p>
