          Recieved email from a good friend named Wizarmin on Xegony about Ice 
          Comet (She is the first person that I know of that has created the spell 
          by getting the runes the hard way... killing Nagafen and Vox). Here 
          is an exerpt of what she told me:<br>
          - &quot;The casting time is virtually same as Rend so it's about 9 seconds 
          I'd say. There is a slight refresh delay after casting the spell, like 
          maybe 4 seconds instead of the normal 2 for other spells&quot;</p>
        <p>Also have a pic of Stalkin of The Rathe firing off Ice Comet. Click 
          <a href="../screenpics/StalkinIceComet.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> 
          if you wish to take a looksee.</p>

          Well, I was up for a full 32 hours with no rest. 15 of those hours were 
          spent within EQ. Yes, just when I said I would not go back in Najena 
          for a while, I did. And yes... I went back to help my best friend acquire 
          some Journeyman Boots. This time it only took 8 hours of camping until 
          we got the first pair. We actually got 3 pairs in about 10 hours.</p>
        <p>I had Saladan of Xegony get in touch with me in game last night. He 
          had in his posession the Shining Metallic Robe and some other nifty 
          items. I will put up the info asap. Thanks!</p>

          Stalkin of The Rathe seems to be the first to acquire the spell 'Ice 
          Comet'. It does 1120 damage while using 400 mana. Sure would like to 
          know the casting time on this to put to rest the 40 second myths. If 
          you know, let <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">me</a> know. Thanks!</p>

        up until the third set of runes. Don't waste your ingredients! I will

        While getting the pic of the female Dark Elf that initiates the Evil Research 
        Quest out of my directory, I happened on a photo I took a while back. 
        Seemed this Ogre Officer did not want to lie down after slain. So I carefully 
        rested upon him. Take a <a href="../screenpics/resting_on_officer.jpg" target="_blank">look</a>

          After some tweaking, I seemed to have the site squared away for all 
          of you Netscape users. I apoligize for not doing this earlier. Site 
          sure was ugly for you. Let me know if you have any troubles (besides 
          the color scheme). Heh... no matter what you do, there is always going 
          to be one person that won't like it. I have changed the text color once 
          to accomodate a few people.. please don't make me do it again. =) </p>

        Well, I bit the bullet and downloaded the new Netscape and looked at the 
        website with it. All I can say is 'bleh'. Boy do I wish they would come 
        to an agreement with MS as to what things should look like. Sure as heck 
        would make it easier for the web designers. I'm not going to tell you 
        what browser to use, but in my own honest opinion.. Microsoft does have 
        a superior browser. Anyway, I'll do what I can for the Netscape users 
        out there... by the way, this text is really grey. =)<br>

        <p>Just a word of thanks to the people I met within my home dungeon of 
          Najena last night. I logged on in the morning with the hopes of obtaining 
          a pair of Journeyman Boots. A group was already camping and they agreed 
          to turn the room over to me when they were done. Myself and my guildmates 
          took the room over at 10am and over the course of 12 hours, I waited 
          the drop from Drelzna. Finally, at about 10pm I got my boots. Yes, I 
          looted every single one of her corpses during that period with no boots. 
          (I have quite the extensive amount of Earrings of Disease Reflection 
          by the way). During this whole camping process, a group came behind 
          wanting the room. I talked with them and they agreed to wait until got 
          my boots before they took over the room. I want to thank them for their 
          great patience.</p>
        <p>Corwyn - High Elf Wizard<br>
          Bacc - Human Wizard<br>
          Mezloc - Don't know what you played. =)<br>
          Gaelead - Enchanter, so who knows what he really was.</p>
        <p>All of you listed above.. A HUGE thank you for your patience, keeping 
          me laughing, and encouraging me to stay until I got them. People like 
          you make this game a great enjoyment for me and others.</p>
        <p>Besides the individuals listed, I wish to thank my guildmates of Darkmoon. 
          Without you, Drelzna would have Harm Touched me to death a few times. 
          Keiote', Atos, Darmak, Izzterl, Nytewolf, Jenalea, Hrava, and an ex-guildmember 
          but always a true friend.. Hwaan. Over the long camping many of you 
          came and went, thank you for filling the spots of those who had to leave. 
          (If I forgot anybody.. forgive me. I am a very forgetful old Wizard)</p>

          Wow.. Huge apoligy for the site being down today. Sort of totally out 

          of my hands. Seems that the server I lease took a major crash this morning. 

          I did everything in my power to get things going, but there was just 

          no server to work with. The worst part was that there was no way for 

          me to let you viewers know that it would be back. Anyway.. on a lighter 

          note. Last night I put up a small quiz survey on your opinions of the 

          Wizard class. By a huge margin the most common answer was &quot;Average. 

          We need minor tweaks.&quot; I personally love being a Wizard and would 

          never trade for another class. I do feel we need a small tweak, but 

          hey... what class doesn't. There is no 'perfect' class. I think Wizards 

          just kick butt. Period.</p>

          Last night on Xegony the GM's had a high level player event within Oasis 

          of Marr. Dubbed the 'Undead War', the GM's took control of all undead, 

          were in named spectre's, and a flying armored Troll. High level 40 players 

          were having to zone during the battle. I witnessed one area effect spell 

          casted by the GM's that killed in excess of 25 players in one shot. 

          Here is a pic of the beach after that area effect.</p>

          Just need to do an explanation for submits. Lately, I have received 

          a few item submits with the stat pics directly from EQ'lizer. This is 

          not cool. These guys work very hard on their website and I will not 

          accept these submits. Plagiarism is a no-no in my book. I appreciate 

          the submits, but please make them original. If you know somebody with 

          a unique item, ask them to put it in trade window and take a pic of 

          the stats. I'll still give you the credit for it. Remember mana and 

          intelligence items are very welcome. Thank you for understanding. -Graff&euml;<br>

          Since the moving of the site, I've had a few people (including myself) 

          only seeing this news page in it's old form (July 3rd was the last update 

          to the old site). This is a browser problem with IE 5.0 and here is 

          how to rectify the problem:</p>

        <p>1. Close down all instances of IE 5.0 that are running and restart 

          one session.<br>

          2. Delete your shortcut to this site (even if it says www.graffe.com 

          is the URL)<br>

          3. Delete the browser cache (Tools\Internet Options\General Tab\'Delete 

          Files')<br>

          4. If you can, I suggest deleting your History also.<br>

          5. Browse to this new URL again www.graffe.com and make a new shortcut.</p>

        <p>Sorry about all of this, gotta love Microsnot. Sorry to say, I've given 

          into the dark side and use MSIE 5.0 also. I was a Netscape loyal until 

          they sold out to AOL (Army of Loosers). Oops.. did I say that? Sorry 

          if I offended anybody that uses AOL out there but I really dispise them 

          and their practices of shoving their service down the throat of the 

          general population with all of thier false promises. Damn.. that rant 

          felt GOOD!</p>

          Server Updates:<br>

          <b>Chill Sight</b>. For sale now on merchants. Not confirmed but Geoffrey 

          Z hinted that it was the Wizards completion for our toy spells in the 

          'Sight' line and is rumored to be much like Ultravision. I am waiting

        <p align="center"><img src="ChillSight.jpg" width="308" height="124"></p>

        <p align="left"><b>Invisibility Warning</b>. Server patch news stated 

          &quot;Invisibility spells (Invisibility, Gather Shadows, Camouflage, 

          etc.) will now blink before they wears off.&quot; Seems that this is 

          not working correctly. I've gotten the 'You Appear' message at least 

          10 times tonight.</p>

        <p align="left"><b>Root spells</b>. &quot;Root spells will now overwrite 

          spells with both positive and negative movement components in a more 

          consistent pattern.&quot; My guess on this one is that if you have casted 

          Bonds of Force on a mob and you quickly Root it, Root will work and 

          cancel out the Bonds of Force.</p>

        <p align="left"><b>Research</b>. &quot;Research for higher level spells 

          has been made a bit easier.&quot; LOL! Ya, right. They call killing 

          Lady Vox and Nagafen easy?</p>

          Finally came to the conclusion that it would not be implimented until 

          the scheduled maintenace at 3am this morning. I will update the site 

          with the info tonight (at work now).</p>

          Been receiving alot of submits with spell locations. This is really 

          helping me out. I wish to thank all of you for taking the time to send 

          in the info. I am working on the page (doesn't seem too extensive but 

          there is alot of info that needs to go in) but it will take a while 

          to get it into a format that I like. Plus I hope you all understand 

          that I need my game time too. =) </p>

        <p>By the way... the counter is back. Made it so it will only count unique 

          IP's. This helps with the 'real hits'... not just somebody sitting there 

          hitting F5 or the refresh button.. over and over.</p>

          Well, I'm back. As I hoped, I had a pretty full mailbox. Not too many 

          submissions, but a couple good ones. The additions and changes are as 

          follows:</p>

        <p>Added the Petrified Erudite Heart Pendant to the <a href="../armor/armor.htm" target="main">Armor</a>

          <br>

          Updated the info on the Impskin Gloves upon the <a href="../armor/armor.htm" target="main">Armor</a> 

          page.<br>

          <br>

          Made it known upon the <a href="../research/research.htm" target="main">Research</a> 

          page that there is two types of Fulguration Runes out there. Both are 

          stackable yet only one will work with creating spells. <br>

          <br>

          Added a 'Rune Disclaimer' to the <a href="../research/research.htm" target="main">Research</a> 

          page. I had to add this because I had many new Wizards asking what mobs 

          drop what runes. After a while it gets a bit tedious e-mailing the same 

          thing over and over. &quot;There is no set mob that will drop a set 

          rune. Rune drops are completely random.&quot; If you are of level 16 

          or lower, please go read it. I do not mean to sound harsh here, for 

          we all were in your position at one time too. I just hope this shed 

          some light on the subject.<br>
