And so it was written that one monk shall stand alone
against the coming apcolypse that will bring darkness
to the land. He will fight with only his bare hands to
prevent the reign of darkness and terany that the evil
he must fight will bring.
<br><br>
I have never really told the story of
how that came to be. My story is not a very happy one,
at least the reason for me to choose the path of the
lone monk.
<br><br>
It was a long time ago, by now it seems like another
lifetime. It was long before the endless ones, and
before my days in the justice leauge. Back when my
story begins, Iskars where only a myth, the moon was
still just to look at, and anyone babbling about an
ice contenent was thought to be insane.
<br><br>
I was a young monk living the good life in Qeynos. I
had just begun to learn about the power of ones inner
fire and how to use my bady as a weapon. It was a
happy time, I had spent many hours helping to rid the
world of those hated gnolls in Blackburrow, they where
not all that tough and it was a great time, that is
where I met her, a halfelf whose bueaty was beyond
compare. She was just as firey as she was pretty and
we managed to kill far more gnolls as a team then we
ever could alone.
<br><br>
I am still baffled to this day why she fell for me.
She coulda had anyone in the world and for some strage
reason she picked little old me! We where young and in
love, oh it seemed perfect. We would lay out in hills
and watch the stars and it seemed like time stood
still. I could do no wrong, it would seem that every
joke I told her was funny, and I loved to see her
lovely smile and those danceing eyes.
<br><br>
Then one day she said that she wanted to travel to
east karana to visit her father. It was going to be
his birthday, and he was stuck out there on buesness.
So we decided to go out there and suprise him. Though
niether one of us had yet to travel very far outside
the hills we felt like we could take on the world and
were invincable. we felt no need to worry as we
readied for our trip.
<br><br>
It was cold that day, unusally cold. But that did not
down her sprits none and we were off. As we made our
way through the northern plains of karana it began to
rain. While I hated it she took it in stride as she
always did. We would stop at the guard towers to dry
off and to warm up and then back out we went.
<br><br>
I felt even with the bad weather we where makeing good
time. When up ahead of us we saw two people standing
on the trail. We figured they were just unlucky
traveler, much like ourseves, and didnt pay them much
attention. That was the biggest mistake of our lives.
<br><br>
They turned out to be bandits!! A vile scum that hung
out away from the guard towers. There were only two so
we began to fight them. My skills as monk were good
and we seemed to handle them rather well. But, I didnt
see the other 2 sneaking up behind us. They also
jumped us and we fought harder than I ever thought we
could. It seemed like I was throwing punches for
hours, but after just barely suriving the fight I
turned around to see my love dead at my feet.
<br><br>
I was overcome with sorrow as I knelt down by her. I
picked her up into my arms and held her til I passed
out.
<br><br>
I'm not sure how long I was out for, coulda been hours
or maybe a couple of days, but I was awakened by two
rangers on there way back to Surefall Glade. They
picked me up and litterally had to drag me away. I was
still very sad and depressed. After they dragged me
back home to Qeynos, I found my way to nearest pub
where I stayed for a long long time.
<br><br>
I'm not really sure how long I tryed to drown her
memery and my sorrow away, those days are pretty much
a blurr to me, but filled with just saddness and self
pitty. Then one day one of the brothers from the monk
guild walked into the pub. I not sure why he was
there, for the monks rarely drink, but there he was.
He told me that I was wasteing my life, my skills, and
I wasnt doing my love memory any good sitting in here.
Somehow he talked me outa there and back into
training.<br><br>

It was durring this training that I first learned
about the discipline of the lone monk. The lone monk
would be a man who travel all of the world doing his
best to fight with honor and to rid the world of evil.
The only down side was that the lone monk was never
allowed to put his feeling ahead of his quest. He must
always be at the ready no matter where or what.
<br><br>
This seemed to be prefect for me. Seeing how I still
missed my love I lost so long ago, I felt as if I
counld never love again anyway. So I took the lone
monk oath. Thus makeing me the Lone Monk of the
Apocalipyse.
