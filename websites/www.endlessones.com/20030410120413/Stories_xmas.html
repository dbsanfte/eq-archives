The wind blew out of the east, cold and fast. The snow fell and hit a traveler's face like 
a thousand needles. This was not a night Lazulu wished to be out. He had been traveling 
for many days, running errands for his new allies, the Coldains. He had fought many battles and 
he was extremely fatigued. All Lazulu wanted was a good night's sleep but travel to Thurgadin
would take several hours and he just couldn't go on. So he nestled up in an abandoned cave
and gathered his spider fur cloak about him. He pulled out his pipe,   a gift from a halfling
sheriff, and his last bit of pipeweed, which he had bought on his last trip to Rivervale,
and he smoked while reflecting on recent events.
<p><p></p></p>
He was just beginning to relax when a strange noise caught his attention.
 It sounded like.....bells. "Bells? Why would I hear bells in the middle of the Great Divide?" 
 He thought to himself. The bells he heard were not of the Ding-Dong variety, nor were they of
the big Bong-Bong variety. They made a sort of Ching-Ching-Ching sound in a very pleasant rhythm.
Lazulu sprang to his feet to investigate as to what kind of sorcery was behind this. 
He looked over the cliff on which his cave sat...Nothing. He peered around the corner...Nothing.
He peered around the other corner...Nothing. 
<p><p></p></p>
Just as he was about to give up his search he looked up at the sky and to his amazement he 
saw an incredible sight. Eight tiny reindeer streaked through the sky pulling a very ornate sleigh.
"Reindeer dont pull sleighs" Lazulu wondered to himself. He took a closer look and discovered 
a sight even more queer. He noticed a small man riding in the sleigh. Suddenly, the sleigh began
to descend. Lazulu prepared for battle. As the sleigh drew closer he began to consider the man. 
The man was short, a little taller than a dwarf with dwarf like features. He also resembled the
gnomes in some ways. His disposition was very cheery. He didn't scowl or look ready to attack, 
rather he seemed quite amiable toward Lazulu. He wore a suit of a soft red material with white 
fur trim. He landed the sleigh and jumped out to greet Lazulu.
<p><p></p></p>
"Hello Lazulu! I know you may not know who I am but unfortunately I have no time for 
introductions. I have many [deliveries] to make tonight and I don't know if I can get them 
all done. It seems that the world of Norrath has gotten much larger as of late." 
<br><br>
"What deliveries?" Lazulu asked remembering past situations similar to this which resulted 
in him recieving some nice trinkets.
<p><p></p></p>
The man replied"Could you take this [bag of goods] and deliver the contents 
to children throughout Norrath? They may not seem like important items to you but these 
little items can bring joy to the heart of little people who will be our future."
<p><p></p></p>
"I will deliver the contents of this bag of goods." Lazulu answered, eager to get the 
deliveries done so he could recieve his reward. His mind raced trying to anticipate what 
he may recieve. He hastily grabbed the bag and rushed off to make his first delivery. 
<p><p></p></p>
Lazulu was very puzzled by many of the odd items he delivered and he didn't understand 
why the man had told him to use great stealth whilst delivering these things. However, 
Lazulu was trying to do his best to please the man...there was a reward on the line after all, 
or so the hapless ranger assumed.
<p><p></p></p>
Lazulu delivered the last of the items in the wee hours of the morning. 
He was exhausted and he almost forgot about the reward he had assumed he would get. 
He returned to his cave to get some rest. He decided he would seek out his reward after 
he got some much needed rest. He pulled his cloak about him and layed on the floor when he 
spotted a package in the corner of the cave. There was a parchment attached to the package. 
<p><p></p></p>
It read simply "To Lazulu From Santa" Lazulu was not concerned with who this Santa fellow was...
He was just interested in the contents of the package. He opened the box and inside was another
box with odd markings and lettering. Inside this box, behind some kind of transparant film,
 was a doll. The mighty ranger was very perplexed. He looked at the box and wondered aloud
  "What in Karana's ghost is a G.I Joe with Kung Fu grip?" 
  Not knowing, he simply shrugged his shoulders and threw the box out in the snow. 
  He curled back up in his cloak and drifted to sleep, dreaming about when he
   would recieve his reward from the funny man in the red suit.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO YOU ALL FROM YOUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORHOOD PATHFINDER!!!!
