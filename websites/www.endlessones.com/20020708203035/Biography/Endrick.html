Endrick of Fairforest A.K.A. Ed the Mage

Endrick's early life is shrouded in mystery… Some stories say he was lost in the woods as a small Elven child and raised by gnomes, thus accounting for his often times mishap-riddled life…
Some stories say he's the somewhat scattered brained (even for an elf) and disowned son of a High Elf noble…
Some say "its just Ed…" with the appropriate rolling of the eyes…
<br><br>
The truth in some ways is even odder…
<br><br>
Endrick was born Trevarthan Silverleaf 342 years ago in the Elven lands called Fairforest woods to the Silverleaf clan.  Trevarthan was like any other normal child, curious, adventurous, mischievous, and accident-prone…    At a very early age Trevarthan began his studies in magic with a local Elven wizard and took training as a fighter as well… Trevarthans' first lesson in wizard school was about true names… 
The name you are born with is your true name… this name holds power over the person… It can be used in soul binding rituals, banishment spells and other arcane spells…  Trevarthan took the use name Endrick of Fairforest.  Pronounced as it's spelled… End Rick
Early on in his career Endrick ran into a problem… No one could remember his name and got called "Hey you" a lot… or "Hey Mage"… So Endrick adopted the Name Ed the Mage… and it stuck.  Now he answers to Endrick, Endi, End or Ed… and of course… Hey you…
It was about the same time that Endrick met up with another elf that was a Wizard, Cleric, and Rogue named Feree.  Endrick and Feree traveled through the lands as adventurers for several months before encountering the minions of a vampire named Vladar.
<br><br>
Vladar is a Wizard, Cleric who was cursed when he put on a pair of evil rings he found…  The rings caused him to become a vampire with the desire to rule all…
Unfortunately for Vladar and Endrick… they met…
Endrick and Feree spent the better part of their early adventuring careers dodging and defeating Vladar's minions, until some time around Endrick's 5th season when he was killed in a battle with Vladar's forces.
<br><br>
Being unable to bring Endrick back from the dead because of his elvish heritage and the need for a Wish spell to bring an elf back from death, Endrick's companions had him reincarnated…
<br><br>
Endrick's reincarnated body was that of a Norseman fighter named Decker the Black… (For more on Decker the Black A.K.A. Deker the Black see his character listing…)
<br><br>
After several years Endrick's companions came into the possession of a Wish spell and were able to locate Endrick's corpse and bring him back from the dead… with one small problem… 
<br><br>
Endrick and Decker shared a soul now…
<br><br>
Which wasn't exactly the perfect thing to make Endrick and Decker best buddies… Infact about the only 2 things they agreed on was 
<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.) Vladar needed to be dealt with…<br>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.) The other one was an idiot…<br><br>

Endrick held the opinion that Decker was an uncouth, unwashed barbarian meatheat and Decker thought Endrick was a flighty, flakey, flower eating bonehead… Fortunately they had a common enemy… 
<br><br>
Endrick has during his career been killed in some of the strangest ways imaginable…
<br>
·	Caught in the crossfire of two Black Dragons acid breath… He was picked up with a squeege and a sponge… <br>

·	Turned into stone and dropped down a stairwell…<br>

·	Drowned in a shambling mound… 4 times… For those of you unfamiliar with shambling mounds… Imagine a walking, swampy, garbage heap that sucks you into it's body and drowns you…<br>

·	Killed in a shambling mound once by his own party trying to rescue him by killing the creature with Lightning bolt spells… Lightning doesn't hurt them it just makes them grow larger… Endrick had frizzy hair for weeks after that…<br>

·	Died from a small snakes poison and disintegrated by an enemy wizard… Luckily he had a clone in the works…<br>

·	Killed himself with a mis-cast Death spell…<br>

·	Killed himself with a Fireball to prevent the orc from killing him… His companions had to pick parts of him out of the stew pot a few days later…<br>
<br><br>
This is the reason Endrick got the Nickname "Dead Again Ed"<br><br>

In recent years Endrick climbed to the pinnacle of Wizardhood… Archmage… and was comfortably running his own school of magic… Teaching his students, not to do the things he did as a young adventurer… He also ended up making peace with Decker and the two have been known to share a drink now and again…
<br><br>
On a routine trip about a year ago Endrick was teleporting across the continent when suddenly he found himself in Norrath… and 1st level again… 
<br><br>
His first thought… "Oh well… Just like being reincarnated… Start over…"
<br><br>
So here he is… But it seems he has a few friends here as well… Somehow Decker followed him here… Unfortunately Decker blames him for his being in Norrath and again thinks Endrick is a bonehead.  He's sure somehow it's Endrick's fault and if he can ever get his hands on him…
