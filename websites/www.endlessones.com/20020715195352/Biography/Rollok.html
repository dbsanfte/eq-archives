Halasmen, just like most cultures, have a high regard for their family heritage. Although I am not a man of words, and when I was asked to chronicle my life thus far, I knew that I would have to ask my endearing wife Rikkitou, to transcribe my thoughts. It was no surprise to any of my belief that the skill of writing is for Shaman and lamers. It takes time away from the battle.<br><br>

Like most stories, mine begins at the start… the start of my life that is. Although we are unsure who my actual father is, my mother Gahrou Psychoswords, has it narrowed down to one of five men she was with the night of my conception. Five warriors I might add, all men I have great respect for, none whom I call father. It was true, mom loved a good time. Gahrou roughly translates into common as hoochi-mama. Without a father I was raised by my mothers father, Winterkill Psychoswords, or Grandpappy P to the young Rollok. <br><br>

Winterkill was a powerful man, even in the golden years of his life. The tribe changed his name to Winterkill (no one knows what it was before that) the night Halas was besiged by a terrible ice storm. It was what my people call a whiteout. The storm was so fierce it provided the Ice Giants cover as they attacked our perimeter guards. If it had been any other race the city surely would have fell, but it was my kinsman, and they fought for the safety of Halas this time. Grandpappy P got his name when he alone fought an Ice Giant that had made it into the Halas lagoon. It is told to this day, that he drew his two swords, shouted praise to the Tribunal and plunged into the icey depths. He was under water a very long time, and was feared dead, although neither could the townspeople see the fiend. Then a hand appeared at the dock. Pulling himself out of the water, my grandfather plopped the head of the giant down for all to see. From that day forth he was simply Winterkill.<br><br>

As I reached adolescence I saw little of my mother. Although I’m not sure exactly what she did for employment, I know her hours were horrible. She worked most every evening, sometimes not getting home for days. I had Winterkill, however, and he taught me the way of the Warrior. One day, while throwing stones at my childhood friend Dantar, Winterkill approached us with a shine in his eyes. So excited was he, that we could barely understand him when he explained Dantar and I had both been accepted into The Halas Institute of Warfare.<br><br>
