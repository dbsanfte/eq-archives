<fontsize="3"><b><p align="center">EO hit the ToFS on 5/17<br>
 and <br>I mean literally!</b></font></p>
EO - too many deaths to count<br>
TOFS - NONE <br><br>
 
That's right no causalities at all the entire night. Must have been those fantastic clerics 
we had. Dokh in Group 1 and Tsianna & Celestyal in Group 2. <br> <br>

First group went in earlier and made it to the 5th floor.
 Had to regroup when Gildana had to leave and took in 2 groups. 
 Group 1 made it back to the 5th floor and Group 2 hung on the 3rd floor. 
 Ebisu FINALLY made 46 (are you sure 45 isn't a hell level anymore???)<br><br>

Notable loot for group 1<br>
(Prices from EQprices)<br>

<b>Diamond Wedding Band</b> - AC2, Dex 2, Wis5, Int5, SvFire8, SvCold8 
- went to Itnusar (approx value 1700pp!)<br><br>

<b>Laced Veil</b> AC2, Dex4, Cha8, Agi3, SvFire5, SDis8 - went to Micah (1700pp)<br><br>

<b>Velium Spiked Skull helm</b> - AC10, Str5, Cha5, ALL saves +5
Gildana, Ebisu, Ted, and Dokh - /sob - no drop<br><br>

<b>Embalmers Skinning Knife</b> 24 4, Dmg 6, Effect Summon Bandages - Ebisu (600pp)<br><br>

Got 2 more keys to go to floor 5 and 3 (count em -3) to go to floor 6<br><br>

 GO Endless Ones. Next assault on the Tower is next Friday - May 24th.

	Heya!

Just a few words about this weekends Chardok run...

First, many thanks to EVERYONE who turned out. We had a solid showing from not only EO, but Legion of Kings, Order of the Fallen Ones, and Twilight Avengers, who showed up with a full group.
<br><br>

We entered with 36 people, 6 full groups, every group had a healer and evaccer this week, and halfway down the tunnel, Nic asks if we have a rogue...

DOH!!!
<br><br>
So I start hunting for a rogue while we continue on. By the time we got past the Bridgekeeper, we had a rogue, (THANKS JORNA!) and continued on.
<br><br>
Pretty routine stuff outside the palace ... pull/kill/pull/kill/oops/rezz...

But every week is a learning experience, and this was no different...we tried clearing guards en masse with AoE's, which is a valid tactic for this spot, but for whatever reason, it didn't go off as planned. Big CR time at the palace entrance.
<br><br>

Which brings me to this week's lesson learned.

We're at (actually past) the point where as much preparation needs to go into disaster-recovery as goes into the main raid plan.  

All the corpses were recovered soon enough for XP rezzes except Hodag's original.

<br><br>

SO...having survived this...

Next time we camp a rezz crew before doing anything that may result in a wipeout...
(AoE'ing can probably clear this area with 2 groups, provided they're familiar enough 
to coordinate actions). 
<br><br>

I'd like to thank everyone for their patience through this one,
 30+ people could have easily made life a lot harder for me yesterday, 
 especially with clocks on rezz timers ticking, and RL calling.
<br><br>
Ready to go again?
