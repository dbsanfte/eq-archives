&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last..after years of study, I have finally been accepted as 
a member of the Order of Three! My heart nearly burst when I was given my robe of the order. 
Father paid for my apprenticeship to Master Gahlith Wrannstad, a wizard of great renown and
 one of the masters of the Order. Father says he is very proud of me and my accomplishments; 
 I can see it in his eyes that he wishes Ventraal were the same way. <br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He paid for the both of us to be apprentices, but Ventraal 
 often ran off into the hills for days at a time. I know he has been with the rangers who live in Surefall Glade, and has apparantly become one of them. Though Father is disappointed, he nonetheless supports Ventraal in his decision.
Ventraal and I have decided to go out and explore the wild, wide world of Norrath, 
to journey to the towns and cities. Father's stories about his travels have surely inspired us...
we leave on the morrow. I must rest and prepare myself for the journeys to come.
<br>
<br>

 	<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Ventraal's Journal - Day 1</b></font> 	 </p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father had bid us farewell, had given us basic provisions for our journey, and even light arms to defend ourselves with. Immediately outside of Qeynos, Corrun and I cleaned up vermin for awhile, just to hone our skills. Father took to Corrun better, mainly because he prefered to study the arcane magicks... such things never appealed to me. Playing hooky from classes would enable me to climb to the top of the parapets and look out to the green hills and lush forests, to gaze upon beautiful sunsets. Corrun could never appreciate these things... always a book over the outdoors. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since father would busy himself furthering my brother's studies, I had to learn the combat arts from Master Sureshot. I realized that I was forbidden to go to Surefall Glade, but father would never enforce it. Whether it was because he secretly approved or could care less, I do not know. Regardless, the ranger was kind enough to teach me in the arts of swordplay and archery, though my skills are grossly inadequate to his. But this meager training was enough to defend Corrun and myself in the beginning of our travels.
