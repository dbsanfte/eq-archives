Tumpy weaved a bit on his stool. It was quite obvious that he had drank more than his fair share of ale but he refused to quit til he had the answer to an aged old question.

"Zacks" he said "Why do ye fall down so much?"<br><br>

"Argh" Zacks replied "That question be a wee bit personal, dont ye reckon? 'Tis a secret I have not even shared wit me dear siblings...the money grubbin bastiges. What business is it to ye?"

"T'aint really any business of mine, but I be a tad bit curious none de less." Tumpy chortled. "Why don't you humor an old dwarf?"<br><br>

"Tis kinda embarassin' to speak the truth. I rarely speak o' it. However, if ye would be so kind as ta have the barkeep refill me mug I might just spill it." Zacks replied.

"Pour ye a stout just sos ye can spill it in me bar? I think not!" Tumpy said indignantly.

"No, Ye silly midget" Zacks said, playfully punching Tumpy in the arm. "Buy me a drink and I just may let ye in on me secret!"<br><br>

Tumpy bought a round and eagerly waited. Zacks rapidly lifted his mug and just as quickly emptied it.

"Nope" Zacks sighed "I cin still see straight. No secret fer yoo!"<br><br>

Tumpy hastily ordered another round...and another...and another...and another until finally Zacks cried;"OK I serrender! Let me show ye."

With that, Zacks removed his left boot to reveal but one very large and gnarled toe.

"There, ye happy?" Zacks shouted.

"Well I'll be the son of a hairless halflin' " Tumpy replied in astonishment "How did ye manage that?"

"Aah, That would require more ale, me friend!"<br><br>

"Look here ye dirty, freeloadin'bum, ye done emptied one a' me barrels already! I do reckon ye owe me." Tumpy said through a string of slurs and stutters.

"Nope" Zacks said and with that he began to stagger for the door.

"Alright, Alright already" Tumpy exclaimed. "Another round Barkeep!" By this time Tumpy was havin trouble discerning which Zacks was the real one. It takes a lot to put ole Tumpy down like this but he had been drinking for almost two days.

Zacks quickly hobbled back to the bar and he gulped down the brew and wiped his chin. He turned to Tumpy and said with an evil grin "Would ye believe it was a game of Ogre poker gone bad?"

"Look herew joo son of a motherless eroodit," Tumpy shouted angrily "Joo best spill it"<br><br>

With a quick swipe, Zacks commenced to knock every mug within reach off the bar. Beer splashed all over Tumpy's fine tavern. It dripped from the chairs and pooled onto the floor. Tumpy lunged at Zacks in a furious rage. "I oughtta skin joo and sell yer hide to the orcs!" he screamed.

Zacks, laughing gleefully, jumped from his stool and threw his stubby hands up. "Hey old friend, I was just tryin' to get yer goat and from the looks of things I was mighty successful!"he chuckled.

"By Brell's beard ye sure did! Now out wit it!" Tumpy's eyes burned with dwarven rage.<br><br>

Zacks conceded. He told the tale of how he came from a long line of drunks and how his mother had smoked drench flowers and how if his breed wern't the most stout of all the Dwarves in Kalidim that they would have surely died out by now. His tale was one of woe. He spoke of how his fine family name had been drug through the mud in the past few generations and that he could barely expect anyone to accept him if they knew that he was only born with four toes. As Zacks finished his story he hung his head low. "Now ye see why I couldn't just tell ye. It is sad aint it?" When Zacks got no response, He glanced over at his old friend. A bit of drool trickled down Tumpy's chin. He had passed out and had missed the whole thing. Zacks got up and cheerfully strode outta the tavern and fell face first into the street. Without hesitation, he picked himself up and ambled towards the gate whistling a merry dwarven tune
