Drixtz Vol'Drakas - The Final Chapter<br><br>

The battle had been fought, the destruction wrought, and the most incredible of magic wielded. His enemies came, and they were conquered. The wizard and his friends the only ones remaining.<br><br>

There was silence in the realm, the corpses of his enemies laying at the foot of the mountainside. The green robed wizard turned from the devastation he had created, lightning bolts flashing in his eyes, blue strands of magic swirling around his body; the air filled with the power no one has ever before wielded. The dark elf’s rage fulfilled, with no more foes left to destroy, yet his power continues to grow. Yet he has grown tired of this destruction. He takes a single step forward towards the edge of the mountain, the ground hundreds of feet below, invisible to him, covered by the mist. This mist that covers the eyes of all who try to look forward into the future, prevents us doing more than guessing what is yet to come. Drixtz takes a single glance back, at a world that has grown so familiar to him. His eyes scan the horizon of Norath, memories of his friends, of times past and present. The battles in the depths of Karnor’s Castle, the destruction of mighty foes in the hell of Chardok, and the countless number of other battles he has pursued.<br><br>

The aging wizard, his hair as white as his skin is blue, his eyes are no longer filled with hatred, with rage. There is a new sparkle in them, one that is growing day by day, a foundation set in him by a mighty Champion. The one warrior that Drixtz will kneel too, Rollok – his silhouette burns into the twilight of Drixtz’s vision. Rollok’s fair lady Kaawa standing guard at his side. Images of the Endless Ones flash one by one in his vision as he stares into the fog. The many friends this evil Drow has made, many in virtue and heart, not always in number. As Drixtz takes one look back onto the world of Norath, he knows there is no more that he can do here, his time is finished. The Dark Elf takes a step closer to the edge, filled with not regret or sorrow, but a longing for what is ahead. The memories of his friends are forever etched into his memory, and his years of adventure will be taken with him into this new world.<br><br>

As one takes a breath before diving into water, he took his last breath of air from this world…and stepped forth off the cliff into the fog, a new adventure. His magic, he knew, would be sacrificed, his power gone, his fortune and everything he had ever accumulated would be no more, yet he did not let this bother him, for he is on a mission.<br><br>

Drixtz had accumulated much wealth and power over the years, and with it came many friends, and enemies. Most important of all these were his friends, this is the one thing that he will take from this world. Friends are the more important than all of the money, all of the power, and all of the prestige one could ever accumulate. This is the one thing that he carriers with him, from now until forever.<br><br>
