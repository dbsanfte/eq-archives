A cool wind swept across the Northern plains of Karana. 
The acrid smell of blood stained the breeze, a product of the war that consumed Norrath. 
It raged everywhere there was life, bringing with it the promise of death. Though the war
was fierce, it paled in comparison to the battle which raged within the heart of the large
barbarian named Rollok. His face was as withered as the stone that produced the bridge 
upon which he now sat. He had seen many things in recent days but he was finally facing
something which he did not know how to approach. He had always thought that whatever
could bring him to his knees would be the very thing that would kill him.<br><br>

He now faced his most difficult trial. It came in the form of tears; the tears of the woman he had come to love.

The wind gave another shudder. It flowed through the beautiful red hair of the young monk who sat 
across from Rollok with her head in her hands. Exasperated by what the couple now faced, 
Rikkitou was fatigued. Her fatigue stemmed not from physical conflict which she had trained
 for and become accustomed to, but from a batlle that now raged within her soul. 
 Her battle was not with the fact that she had left her life of old behind to follow the 
 mighty barbarian. Her inner turmoil was due to the obvious truth that she was about to aid Rollok 
 in an act which would go against almost everything the young lovers believed in.
 <br><br>

As the wind howled, it bought with it memories of old. It told the story of a mighty band 
of heroes. They had come in league with one another to fight for justice. 
They had fought many battles and had conquered many lands. They had joined together
 as a mighty guild to destroy all that they felt was unjust. It was finally catching up to them. 
 Madness had swept across the upper tiers of leadership and was consuming the heroes at an alarming 
 rate. The foundations were crumbling and it seemed that the deteriation could not be stopped.
  Something had to be done and nothing short of manipulation could bring a feasable solution.
   Dreams had died and promises had been broken. The winds of change were blowing but what would they bring with them?
<br><br>
TREASON!! 
The word hung upon Rikkitou's mind like a brick. That is what the young couple was
 now considering. They had counted all thier options and came to the conclusion that 
 thier happiness and the well being of thier aspirations depended on the couple becoming 
 traitors. They must destroy the guild of heroes which they had helped to nurture. Things
  had come to a breaking point. The couple could not stand idly bye and watch things spiral 
  into unconquerable depths. Action was needed and it must be swift.

Rollok was ready to face what must be done. He knew that the only way he could win the battle that raged within was to go against the grain of his very beliefs. He was a noble warrior and noble warriors did not participate in endeavors such as the one that he was about to embark upon. He knew this, yet he also knew there was no other way
<br><br>

So it came to pass that the young couple set thier plan into motion. The process was very tedious. Rollok almost wore a hole in the stone bridge he paced upon while trying to devise the perfect strategy. Thier task was not simple and could not be approached in a such a fashion. They moved in the shadows, collecting allies from within thier ranks. They were always on the outside edge of the battles whispering to those whose assistance would be needed. The collective heroes would have to strike at the perfect moment but thier attack could not be from the front as most of them had come accustomed to. They would have to strike with stealth and poise and thier actions would live in infamy.

The winds began to howl more loudly now. The moment was fast approaching. When would they strike? And how? Thier actions would have to be subtle but meaningful. They chose the event where thier actions would be least expected.
<br><br>
Wedding bells chimed. The guild of heroes had assembled for the joyous occasion. However, the event did not end exactly as expected. As the leader stood to toast the bride and groom, he rose to a virtually empty chamber. The assembled masses, to include the bride, the groom, and the priest, had left the leader to follow his mad pursuits on his own. They left without the honor they had once felt.
<br><br>
Twenty people left the chapel that day to follow a new path, unsure of where it may lead. They were each driven by a different force. Some by dream, desire,or destiny; others by the thought of death, destruction, or despair;some were even driven by delirium. Regardless of the motive, they were all driven by something which was timeless; a force which was ENDLESS....Hence the Endless Ones were born.

However, the winds did not stop blowing there. They swirled into a raging storm. The storm was a neccessary one though. It fed the drought which had consumed the heroes' spirit. Rikkitou and Rollok led the the Endless Ones through many victories. Defeat was not unknown but it was never unconquerable. They fought across Norrath with a renewed purpose. They still fought for justice but now they also fought to lend aid to the oppressed, shelter to the weary, and compassion to the downtrodden. They grew in number and spread thier message across the land with a family spirit in mind. 

Whatever happened to this family of heroes? What is the conclusion to thier story? Being endless, of course, there isnt one
