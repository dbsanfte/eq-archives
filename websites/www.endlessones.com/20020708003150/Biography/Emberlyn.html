<b>Emberlyn…<br>
Emberlyn Vespah…<br>
Princess of the Druids…<br>
Vagabond <br></b>


The princess was a beautiful child.  Just 4 days old and her head was full of red hair and eyes of emerald
 green.  Her birth was heralded around the land.  Kings and Queens, Lords and Ladies, even Gods 
 and Goddesses were present at her presentation.  As her father held her high for the whole kingdom 
 to see, a dark cloud descended upon the gathering crowd.  Lightening flashed brightly across the 
 sky, illuminating the bright green eyes of the child held so high.  The Royal Mage Jeenious began
  to cast a spell.   He tried to send the Royal family to a safe place but his spell was 
  interrupted as a bolt of black lightening laced with purple veins shot from the disc and 
  struck him unconscious. Queen Rikkitou glanced at Jeenious and noted that he still breathed 
  and sighed with relief.<br><br>
  
King Rollok too noted that Jeenious would live and pulled his child closer to his chest.
Queen Rikkitou placed her hand on the kings' shoulder protectively.  They exchanged a worried 
glance.  Rikkitou glanced at Jeenious and noted that he still breathed and sighed with relief. 
 Then the cloud split open and a bright light, brighter than the sun, poured down from through
the gap.  In the center of the light there was a spec of black.  
Darker than the darkest night in the Hole, it descended as a disc, growing larger and more 
  terrifying as it came down hovering above the frightened throng. 
   The guards immediately rushed to take a defensive stance in front of the royal party,
   surrounding them in a protective circle.  The black disc emitted fear in waves.  All who looked upon it, except for the strong, were crippled with the unimaginable horror.  A few fell to their knees and begged their god or goddess for mercy.  Some began retching and many passed out.  Rollok stood fast with his queen at his side.  None of the royal guards even flinched.  The king nodded slightly to Gajan, Captain of the Guards, acknowledging the excellent training of his men and women.  Gajan grunted as only a dwarf warrior can grunt, in acceptance.
<br><br>
The disc hummed slightly as if it were full of unleashed power.  Darkening the sky over the entire gathering leaving little of the bright light seen before it began its descent.  The crowd was hushed with awe and wonder as a strange and haunting melody suddenly filled their minds.  There were no audible words, just a strange voice that seemed to call to the darkest reaches of the hearts of all who heard.  Then the world ended.  A baby cried.
<br><br>
Life is just a dream…
Rollok awoke in the royal bed with Rikkitou at his side.  A strange dream flitted at the edge of his memory but he just couldn't quite describe it to his wife.  She too seemed to recall a dream, it was happy at first, she recounted…but then it ended in pain.  They cuddled and tried to comfort each other.  Rikkitou cried softly in Rollok's arms, though she knew not why.<br><br>

<br><br>
Camp of the gypsies in Oasis of Marr…
The bundle of rags lay quite still in the middle of the gypsy camp.  She had beautiful red hair and emerald green eyes.  She had slight sunburn from sitting so long in the hot Oasis sun.  But she was a quiet child and cried for nothing.  Seemingly content to just stare at the waving treetops nearby.  The gypsy girl who found her almost stepped on her.  Tripping and falling to keep from injuring the baby, Mezick sat up and stared at the bundle of rags with a smiling face poking out.  Mezick was a brightly clothed in a red wrap around skirt and a white puffy peasant shirt, with a purple silk scarf around her head.  She had been freshly cleaned from her daily bath at the shore, her blond hair, still wet, clung to her back and gleamed in the morning light.  
<br><br>
The child, having seen the tumble Mezick had suffered, began to giggle.  Mezick at first started to pout her lip, but seeing the look of mirth on the child's face, she too joined in the laughter.  Mezick picked up the child and sat her upon her knee.  The child appeared to be about 4 months old and held her head up quite well, staring directly into Mezick's blue eyes.  Looking into each other's eyes there passed a moment that felt right.  Like all the planets had been aligned and had waited till this moment to move again.  

<br><br>
Mezick took the child to her hearth.  Mezick had her own tent, having passed the Trials of the Oasis already.  She brought the child into her home and pondered what to do.  Should she keep the child?  Should she turn her back into the wild and forget about her?  Should she find her a home?  The interior of the tent was cheery with bright finger painted designs of trees, wolves, and bears.  There was no furniture and little comforts to be found except for her sleeping mat and her hand tailored backpack.  But now… Now she had a new dilemma.  Where life had seemed so simple before now… Now it was a bit more complicated.
<br><br>
The flap of her tent moved slightly aside revealing the snout of a giant wolf.  Mezick gasped!  The great silver wolf walked slowly in and let the tent flap close behind it.  The ancient wolf sat on the floor directly behind the baby.
<br><br>
"Mezick," the wolf said, his voice was deep and echoed with the voices of all woodland life.  He paused to allow the Mezick the chance to catch her breath.  "This child must be protected at all costs.  She is the hope of the Gods.  She is the future of all upon the face of Norath and beyond.  You and only a few others chosen by the gods can protect her.  I know that this is a great task that is being set before you.  But we are confident that you can help us in this most important task."  He seemed to relax after finishing his speech.  
Mezick tried to fathom what she had just heard.  She managed a question "Who are you?"
The old wolf smiled and his shining white canines gleamed in the glow from the fire.  "I am Zmax.  I am … a friend."  And at that he nodded, winked and began to cast a spell.  As he was casting he said, "Take care of the child.  Her name is Emberlyn, Daughter of the Forest, Hope of us All." And he opened a portal and disappeared.
<br><br>
Mezick stared at the spot the old wolf had occupied a moment before.  The silence was interrupted by the crackle of the cooking fire.  She looked at her new charge lying on the floor before her.  Emberlyn.  How odd, she thought.  Daughter of the Forest.   Well now she had a mission.  The question was…. What in the world would want to harm a child such as Emberlyn?  Perhaps Adamoluna, her wise old lizard friend, might have some good advice.
And that, my friends, is just the beginning of the tale.
