<h3 align="center">Rikkitou Pyschosword<br>Disciple of the Endless</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a star studded night in March, a warrior watches his love give 
birth to a baby girl and then pass into the arms of  Erollisi Marr. Knowing he will be unable to care
for his new daughter, he places her in the care of the monks of Qeynos. The child's name is Rikkitou.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young Rikki is fasinated by the ways of the monks of Qeynos and vows to 
become a Grandmaster someday. However that day is far in the future. She trains hard, and plays little.
Her warrior father, Aanadorn Leomortis, keeps watch from a far, visiting ocassionally with gifts for the 
child. Somewhat of a loner, she prefers to solo but finally decides to leave Qeynos to explore the rest of 
Qeynos</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving in the city of Freeport, alone and without friends, 
she meets a young cleric named Dokh who persuades her to accompany him to Oasis. They become close friends
and he begins telling her of the adventures of a barbarian warrior, Rollok Psychoswords. She is intrigued
by these stories and works hard to reach a point where she is strong enough to travel to the dreaded land
of Kunark to meet this wonderous warrior</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon arriving at the Sarnek Fort in LOIO, young Rikki realized she had
met her soulmate but was heartbroken because to her, he was in love with another, the lovely cleric, Sunii Delite.
Not wishing to come between Rollok and Sunii, but determined to become a his best friend instead, she flirts outrageously with everyone but him. As their friendship develops
a miracle seems to occur, they fall in love. After 10 seasons of being together, laughing, fighting, and killing the unexpected
 occurs. At a magical initation raid, Rollok proposes and Rikkitou accepts, but they realize that they are not a pair but a threesome. To the amazement of their guild, the three decide
that they will marry each other and break all tradition to stay together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Surefall Glade, the three pledge their love to each other, vowing to always
be there for each other. Since that day, many levels have passed for the trio. However, over time all things chanbe
Sunii became more and more devoted to the calling of her God finding less and less time for adventuring. After much discussion,
the trio decide that, as hard as it may be, that Sunii will go her separate way to become a Priestess. 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parting is sad, and Rikki and Rollok bid Sunii a goodbye as they begin their
travels anew as a couple. Across the lands and to the moon, they venture, spreading the word of their Guild - The Endless Ones.</p>
