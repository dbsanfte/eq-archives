 The breeze picked up among the trees, blowing past the young woodelf and trying to flip pages of the book in her lap. A slender hand held them in place as she struggled to memorize the spells she would need. The only others to be seen were some way off, enemies, lying in wait for her to emerge from safety to do battle.<br><br>

But it was not always thus. Fyre, as a wee elf had made friends easily and quickly. Her daily labors were done with the guiding hands of her elders, and the help of those friends. An orphan, she was destined for a life of solitude, the elders had feared... but as she grew her love outshone that of her peers, and she was seldom to even be seen walking about the tree city without someone at her side.<br><br>

She harbored a few crushes as all children do, but none came to fruitation. Aaladek, her good friend, and Deacun her fighting companion on the sands of the Oasis of Marr. And finally, she thought she'd found one... a companion for her life of battle. Guland.<br><br>

The dark elf was tall, a handsome warrior. They battled through Dervs and Orcs, fighting side by side. She would tend to their battle wounds, while he bravely protected her from any attack. Life couldn't be more perfect.<br><br>

But light must be tempered with darkness, and perfection with imperfections. An old love returned to Guland's life, and Fyre followed her head... she let him go. She left for Kunark after wishing them well, and proceeded to work hard for money and a betterment of herself.<br><br>

Even with her 'family' all around her... life just didn't seem as full without a love of her own. She moved almost listlessly from one group of people to another. She was sure, deep down, she'd worry her Auntie Ember, but she couldn't bring herself around to making another effort at the life she led before.<br><br>

Which led her to this place, alone amidst enemies in the Lake of Ill Omen.. her only goal to be the best she can be, and to bring joy and offer all the help she could to her family. A woman didn't need the love of a man to bring joy to her loved ones, nor to help them. But her heart ached, and she hoped one day to be proven wrong, in her quest for self. <br><br>
