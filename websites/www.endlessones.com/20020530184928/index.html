 Memorial Day weekend was a good one for EO. Congratz on all those dings!
 Lanadas and Itnusar dinged at TOFS, Ted hit 49 (finally), Shugabear and Zukul had a
 little double ding going on in Mistmoore (next time we'll get that hilt for Micah). 
 <br><br> Jeenious and Zacks started on their keys for Howling Stones, Valaeria took on 
 Gore. Chardok was a success and so was TOFS. Dings were too many to mention - but
 congratz to everyone on a great job!
 <br><br>
 On a side note, congratz to Nicolas of Chosen Circle, protector of Valaeria,
  for finally getting that epic of  his.
 
<h5 align="center">Language Fair in Qeynos</h5>
 
Well, Endless Ones invaded Qeynos Hills this weekend - and we didn't kill
a thing, except the grass, our minds and a few brain cells. 
Thanks to Brogle's timely suggestion, EO had another language fair which drew 
about 15 members of all levels on Saturday night. Everyone contributed something,
from thieves cant to dragon to elder Teir'Dal.
<br><br>
Thanks to everyone who stopped by..... I hear it went on for a record breaking
9 hours!

	Heya!

Just a few words about this weekends Chardok run...

First, many thanks to EVERYONE who turned out. We had a solid showing from not only EO, but Legion of Kings, Order of the Fallen Ones, and Twilight Avengers, who showed up with a full group.
<br><br>

We entered with 36 people, 6 full groups, every group had a healer and evaccer this week, and halfway down the tunnel, Nic asks if we have a rogue...

DOH!!!
<br><br>
So I start hunting for a rogue while we continue on. By the time we got past the Bridgekeeper, we had a rogue, (THANKS JORNA!) and continued on.
<br><br>
Pretty routine stuff outside the palace ... pull/kill/pull/kill/oops/rezz...

But every week is a learning experience, and this was no different...we tried clearing guards en masse with AoE's, which is a valid tactic for this spot, but for whatever reason, it didn't go off as planned. Big CR time at the palace entrance.
<br><br>

Which brings me to this week's lesson learned.

We're at (actually past) the point where as much preparation needs to go into disaster-recovery as goes into the main raid plan.  

All the corpses were recovered soon enough for XP rezzes except Hodag's original.

<br><br>

SO...having survived this...

Next time we camp a rezz crew before doing anything that may result in a wipeout...
(AoE'ing can probably clear this area with 2 groups, provided they're familiar enough 
to coordinate actions). 
<br><br>

I'd like to thank everyone for their patience through this one,
 30+ people could have easily made life a lot harder for me yesterday, 
 especially with clocks on rezz timers ticking, and RL calling.
<br><br>
Ready to go again?
