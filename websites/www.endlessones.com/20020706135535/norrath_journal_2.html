&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We began our journey outside the gates of Qeynos, 
helping the guards exterminate some of the vermin that always populates the immediate area. 
Ventraal waded in with his sword, while I supported him with my spells. 
Ah, there's nothing like the feeling of a monster writhing under the grip of my magics. 
As we were exterminating the vermin, an Iksar appeared on the path to Qeynos!
 Father had warned us about his foul kind... I remember his stories well, about the destruction they
  wrought on their home continent, their abduction of the elven Lady Firiona Vie...
   I couldn't comprehend how the lizardman could dare show his face in Qeynos!<br><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ventraal, I no not why, welcomed the Iksar with words of greeting. 
  I sought to ascertain why he had come, if he came with the intent to sow havoc and chaos. 
  The lizardman claimed he had come to conduct business in Qeynos, which I found laughable. 
  Our merchants and bankers would sooner kill him than deal with him!
   Still, shortly after encountering us, he ran off towards the city. 
   Ventraal began upbraiding me for my 'biased opinion' and 'close-mindedness'.
    He never read the histories in the Order of Three's libraries...
	he knows not what he was talking of.<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was still lecturing me when the Iksar passed our way again, 
	this time heading back towards the hills. He told that us that he had been unable to conduct
	 his business, as I had known he wouldn't. Still, he did manage to get in and out of a city that
	  hates him and would gladly see him dead, and I must respect that. 
	  <br><br>
	  
	   <div align="center"><b><font size="4">Ventraal's Journal- Day 2</b></font></div> 
	  An Iksar! An Iksar had traveled to Qeynos, and I was lucky enough to talk in length
	   with him! I've heard of their race, and even seen a picture or two in father's old books,
	    but to have one staring at you face-to-face is an incredible feeling indeed! 
		My brother... did not take to him well. Corrun also inherited father's bias towards 
		almost all non-humans. I believe in letting one's actions prove their intentions, 
		and was pleased to be treated cordially by the lizardman.
		 Already, our adventures are proving interesting!
