"<div align="left">Cheslin has asked us not to tell Holly." Hagar said mournfully.<br><br>
"Aye, and with good reason" Corun replied " Holly Windstalker is an asset to us in the hills and to hear that her eldest son was chased to his death by those wretched gnolls would drive her out of the hills and into Blackburrow and possibly never to return!"<br><br>
At that moment Lazulu lept from behind the archery target which he had hidden. "Lazaar has been slain?! I must avenge him!" he cried "Hagar, you must train me in the ways of the ranger. I will avenge my brother's death and bring honor to Surefall Glade."<br><br>
Hagar shook his head "Like your brother before you, you have the wits of your father and the determination of your mother. Guard Cheslin could never breed em too bright! <br><br>
"The fact of the matter is, I feel partly responsible for your brother's death so I could not allow you to follow the same path."<br><br>
"But Hagar, I have a plan that not even you can refuse"
"I am am listening"Hagar replied.<br><br>
"I can keep my mother from leaving the hills. I will strike a deal with the Bards of Qeynos where I will deliver mail for them and in return they would deliver 'messages from Lazaar' to my mother so she does not know that anything is amiss."<br><br>
"To refuse you would be pure folly."Hagar chuckled."I will train you under one condition; you must seek out others like your self to band with, who agree with and understand your cause. Would you do that for me ,boy?"<br><br>
"Of course"Lazulu said eagerly.<br><br>
So after two weeks of rigorous training Lazulu set out upon the hills with many bardic letters in hand. He quickly gained favor with the residents of Qeynos and the surrounding plains of Karana. He was often attacked, not because he went looking for trouble, but he never could find his way around too well despite his ranger training.<br><br>
One day while running around lost, he met upon a young girl named Jarrah who was also a ranger. Remembering his promise to Hagar, he asked if he could join her and to his surprise Jarrah introduced him to the mighty ranger by the name of Dugil McVee who in turn asked Lazulu to become a Ranger of Tunare. Lazulu agreed heartily and started moving abroad. It was in his travels that Lazulu learned of a plot to oust Dugil as head of the Rangers of Tunare. He reported the news to his leader and was rewarded with officership in the guild. <br><br>
One day, Dugil asked Lazulu to do him a favor. It seemed that Dugil wanted a young halfling to join the ranks and wondered if Lazulu would do the honors of inviting her into the guild. Lazulu agreed and headed to Qeynos where he met the lovely Haypence for the first time. After that day the two became inseperable. They headed to Lake Rathe to pursue some Gnolls and with blood of gnolls upon his tunic, Lazulu asked Haypence to marry him on the banks of the lake. They were bestowed the name Loyalscout by Dugil and the happy couple then continued their travels as husband and wife. <br><br>
