Twas the anniversary of the tenth year of the reign of Antonius Bayle.
 The city of Qeynos was buzzing with excitement and wonder. 
 There was a carnival like atmosphere in the air.
  Citizens past and present arrived with vibrant
   enthusiasm at what the week long celebration would bring. 
   Not the least amongst the visitors were members of the elite guild known as the Endless Ones. 
   The reasons for thier attendance was two-fold. Many of them were there to pay homage to
    a man who had ruled the city which they spent much of thier youth. 
	However they were all there to support one of thier own,
	 the bard known as Deacun Trebleclef. Deacun had come to Qeynos to compete in a 
	 talent competition, in order to win a beautiful gem encrusted tamborine. 
	 It didn't make the best clang in the world but did it ever gleam.<p></p> 

"I really don't see the point in this silly competition" Gildana quipped.
 "You couldn't trade that thing for a stack of rotten fish scales!"<p></p>

"As correct as you may be, my little friend," Deacun began 
"Worth is not always measured on a monetary scale. Beauty is more important to some people."
<p></p>
"Aye, Deacun, why do you think Shugabear married me?!" Lazulu exclaimed with a smile.
<p></p>
"It certainly wasn't for your brains!" Tedathalan retorted. 
 <p></p>
Lazulu's scowl was wiped away by a hug from his wonderful wife. "No matter, my dear,I take you with or without brains." Shugabear stated with a grin.
<p></p>
The witty banter was interrupted by the booming voice of the head judge of the contest. "Ladies and Gentlemen, Our next contestant is Deacun Trebleclef. Mr. Trebleclef will you please approach the stage and prepare your instruments?"
<p></p>
With the encouragement of his friends, Deacun took the stage and began to prepare for his performance. He had never been more ready for anything in his whole life and his air of confidence was testament to that fact. He began by tapping a beautiful rhythm then, as if he were playing two songs at once. He started playing his flute ever so softly. Just as the audience was drifting into a dream he broke out in song. His song was a tale of ancient elves and the burdens they overcame. The crowd was virtually mesmerized, but it wouldn't last, for Deacun's song was interrupted by the sounds of chaos.
<p></p>
"Halt this nonsense! In the name of the Bloodsabers and His Highness Kane Bayle, we call this hoax to an end!"
As the guard made his exclamation, the crowd was quickly dispersed, by dark men in armor and evil sorcerors casting spells. All of the patrons were terrified; all except the heroes who had simply come to support their friend. Immediately the Endless Ones took a defensive stance. The rogue, Gildana, slipped into the shadows, waiting for the right oppotunity to strike. The rangers, Tedathalan and Lazulu, lept to opposite corners with bows drawn. Shugabear did not budge, but simply drew her Polearm. Deacun grab his drum and as he bagan to beat out a hym of battle the brawl began. Shugabear swiftly started laying the opposition to waste. Lazulu and Tedathalan deftly plunged arrows into the weak flesh of the sorcerors. At the same time a small figure swept thru the sea of flailing bodies, sinking a dagger between the joints in the evil guards' armor. The drum beat continued. Lazulu quickly ran out of arrows and lept into to battle with daggers drawn. And drum beat on. Tedathalan made human targets of every evil doer in sight. And the drum beat on. Shugabear hacked thru a forest of flesh. And the drum beat on. As the boom of the drum increased in tone, the pitch of battle too increased. Blood, sweat, and many other unidentified bodily fluids ran across the ground, staining the floor of the performance hall. The tempo got faster and faster til suddenly...it stopped. 
<p></p>
Confused the heroes turned to see a sight that chilled thier blood. In the doorway stood a gargantuan man flanked by two of the biggest gnolls any had ever seen. At the end of the sword held by the large man, was the semiconscious body of Deacun Trebleclef. 
<p></p>
"The Endless Ones have gained the ire of Qeynos' future emporor. I am Kane Bayle and I proclaim you my newest slaves. Scoff tho you may, if you do not drop your arms now this one will not be so Endless!" As the words passed through his lips, he laid the tip of his sword across Deacun's throat and as a trickle of dark red blood oozed from the bard's neck and down the blade of the evil Bale, the sound of metal clanged against the floor. The Endless Ones never gave up but neither did they sacrifice one of their friends for pride. With their weapons surrendered, Gildana, Lazulu, Tedathalan, and Shugabear were bound and led away through a secret tunnel beneath the stage. Though most of the crowd had dispersed when the melee began, one small bard named Cyrine had remained to witness this atrocity. Being too small to be noticed by the attackers, Cyrine quickly ran into the night.
