<P><B><BR>
Many people in our lands underestimate the role a Shaman plays
in the overall scope of life. Some consider them tribal witch
doctors, while others consider them second rate casters. This
could not be further from the truth. Shamans, being from mostly
underdeveloped races, tend to rely more on spell components than
other casters. This however is a minor concern when one looks
at the true power of Shamans. <BR>
The Shaman stands out in two ways. First is in their ability to
deal damage to their enemies. While not as powerful as the Wizard,
Shamans should not be overlooked in this area of power. Not only
do they posses spells to damage specific targets, but they can
also do damage over a wider area at once, as well as wield spells
that hurt their enemies slowly over time. Their second area of
expertise is in enhancing the abilities of those around them,
and hampering the abilities of their enemies.</B></P>

<P><B><U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="+1">Rank I<BR>
</FONT></U><FONT SIZE="+1">Burst of Flame</FONT>- Your basic direct

making them unable to combat effectively.<BR>
<BR>

to withstand cold and cold based attacks. This includes the occasional
blizzard that sweeps through the Everfrost Plains.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Dexterous</FONT>- Increases the target's dexterity.
Spells such as this, Strengthen, Feet like Cat, and others that

<U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="+1">Rank II<BR>

be your mainstay direct damage spell, only replaced by Burst of
Flame when mana runs low.<BR>
</B></P>

Sicken will do two things. It will damage them slowly over a period
of time, and it will make them diseased thereby slowing their
ability to heal.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Endure Fire</FONT>- Increases the target's ability
to withstand fire and fire based attacks. Never jump into Lava

natural Agility.<BR>

target's armor class by causing them to actually grow scales over
their skin.<BR>
<BR>

reducing his or her attack speed significantly.<BR>
<BR>
<U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="+1">Rank III<BR>

is a nasty spell that poisons your target, causing them to be
slowly destroyed from the inside out over time.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Spirit Sight</FONT>- Allows you and others to
be able to see invisible beings.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Endure Disease</FONT>- Increases the target's
ability to withstand disease and disease related attacks.<BR>
<BR>

by Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians as it allows them to see in
the dark without use of a light source.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Spirit of Wolf</FONT>- A highly prized enhancement,
Spirit of Wolf allows the target to run even faster than normal,
and boosts his or her ability to withstand fatigue as well.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Spirit of Bear</FONT>- Increases the target's
stamina beyond normal means.<BR>
<BR>
<U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="+1">Rank IV<BR>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Endure Poison</FONT>- Increases the target's ability

<BR>
Burst of Strength- Grants your target a momentary burst of strength
and armor class. This burst lasts for about 18 seconds.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Turtle Skin</FONT>- Increases your target's armor
class by making them grow a magical shell.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Spirit of Snake</FONT>- Increases the target's
Charisma.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Disempower</FONT>- A devastating spell to be cast
on your enemies. Disempower will lower their strength, armor class,
and stamina.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Walking Sleep</FONT>- Walking Sleep is a more
powerful version of the Drowsy spell. It will even further slow
the target's attack speed.<BR>
<BR>
<U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="+1">Rank V<BR>
</FONT></U><FONT SIZE="+1">Affliction</FONT>- Affliction is basically
a stronger, more efficient version of the spell Sicken. You will
want top throw this at them right at the start of battle. This
way they will be suffering its effects while you regain mana.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Infectious Cloud</FONT>- Nearly as deadly as Affliction,
but this spell's effects are spread out of an area around the
target. Very useful for multiple engagements.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Spirit of Monkey</FONT>- Increases the target's
Dexterity to superhuman levels. Cast this on a powerful monk and
watch them go crazy with love for you.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Spirit Strength</FONT>- Increase the target's
Strength even more so than the strengthen spell. Again a favorite
of monks and warriors.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Endure Magic</FONT>- Increases the target's ability
to withstand magical attacks.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Malice</FONT>- Lowers the target's resistances
all across the board. Hit them with this first and they will be
ripe for your disease and poison attacks.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Insidious Fever</FONT>- Makes the target more
susceptible to disease, and hits them with a bit of damage.</B></P>
