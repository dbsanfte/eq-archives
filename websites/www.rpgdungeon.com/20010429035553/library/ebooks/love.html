The bard by definition was one who soothed others souls throught
the magic of music. He tells the tales of legend through verse
and is considered more awe consuming then the greatest of all
gods. Yet Shiro Legendmaker, although thought to be the most wordly
bard in all the land, he felt himself incomplete. Just one story
untold, just one stroy never heard, a single story he could not
find. But he was determined to find it and tell it to all as the
most dramatic bards tale ever to reach human ears. The bard traveled
hundreds of miles, all over the country side, he was in almost
every pub and tavern across the land. He heard many stories of
love from everyone he met but none seemed good enough to be made
into legend. In a pub, near what many believe was his homeland,
he stepped up to the bar.</P>

<P>&quot;So what brings you to the Silver Dragon this day, Shiro?&quot;
asked Ironfist the barkeep.</P>

<P>Shiro replied, &quot;I am here to taste the ale and tell some
stories to your patrons this fine afternoon and eve.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Very well, and your first pint is on me,&quot; remarked
the barkeep as he drew a tankard of ale for the bard.</P>

<P>Taking a seat near the hearth for warmth, he took a sip of
ale and began to strum his mandolin lightly. A crowd made up of
travellers, townsfolk, and other ild gathered around him awaiting
his tales of splendor. He asked if there was any subject or particular
story they would like ot hear. And a young boy said something
about dragons from long ago, and the people urged Shiro to sing.
He took another swig of his ale, but before he started his tale
he noticed out of the corner of his eye a familiar face comming
towards him to also listen to the tale he was going to tell. Slowly
he felt a smile come across his face, and a feeling of warmth
in his heart as he started his story.</P>

<P>Shiro Legendmaker sang, &quot;Once in our world long ago during
the Age of Dreams the dragons flew high above in the skies. The
were the protectors and mortal enemies of those who favored evil.
Of course there were evil dragons but these were seen rarely and
only when they were raiding a an outlying town or village for
food. How magnificent they were, their great windspans, long swordlike
claws, and thier horrific vice-like jaws. Despite their massive
size and deadly features they embodied all that was beautiful.
Some men were even lucky enough to ride on the backs of the dragons
of the light.&quot;</P>

<P>Shiro's story continued for two more hours and three more tankards
of ale. He concluded his tale with the verse, &quot;the dragons
of light vowed that someday they would return and bring complete
peace back unto the world again.&quot;</P>

<P>As the bard finished his story the crowed stared up in the
empty air as if they could actually see the dragons flying right
in the common room of the pub. Shiro's attention was drawn away
by that familiar face again and against the rotests of his audience,
he stated that he must get some sleep, but that he would be again
the next night. After the barkeep thanked him and drew yet another
ale, Shiro hequested his usuall room above the kitchen. Ironfist
just smiled in reply.</P>

<P>As he walked up the stairs leading to the sleeping quarters
he heard the voice that came from the face he had seen earlier.
A smile played scross his face as he looked upon the barkeeps
daughter, Katrina. She kissed him and he returned the kiss in
kind. Katrina was easily the most beautiful women in the village.
Only 22 years old she was in the prime of her life and her beauty
showed that fact well. Although most knew of her relationship
with Shiro, all of the handsome men of the city still chased after
her. Dispite their lavish attempts she always said that her and
Shiro's relationship was to important to her.</P>

<P> Shiro on the other hand was also very comely, handsome, and
charismatic. He had little time for Katrina, much less any other
girls. So when a girl would fall to his charms he would just claim
to be leaving the town the next morning, and would. Katrina had
asked him time after time to stop his traveling and come live
with her for the rest of their days, but he always said that he
must travel. From city to city, town to town, village to village,
so he could keep up with the latest lore. They had known each
other for almost ten years, when they were just children in a
park. But now their feelings for each other grew every time they
saw each other, and their relationship had come to be much more
then a childhood fascination with each other.</P>

<P> The went to his room hand in hand and when they were behind
closed doors they held each other warmly and kissed. Katrina asked,
&quot;What's wrong now Shiro, it's not that silly story you've
been searching for is it?&quot;</P>

<P> In a hurt tone Shiro replied, &quot;You know how important
this story is to me.&quot;</P>

<P> &quot;I know and I'm sorry, but I miss you when you are gone
for so long. You know I'll help you find your story any way I
can.&quot;</P>

<P> &quot;Katrina I hereby promise you that as soon as I find
this story I will settle down and marry you, we will spend the
rest of our lives together,&quot; he said in a serious tone.</P>

<P> She had a big smile on her face as he said this and again
she kissed him. The night went on and they made love. They awoke
the next morning in each others arms by the sounds of a crowd
downstairs. Shiro dressed and went down to see what all the commotion
was about, Katrina was following right behind him as he went.
As the people saw him a cheer arose in his name, one of the village
elders approached him.</P>

<P> &quot;I'm glad your still here, Shiro, we need your help.
A great dragon attacked the village and said that if we did not
give up all of our silver and livestock he would destroy our beloved
homes. He said we have until the sun is at its highest to get
all of our treasure and sheep together and bring it to him up
on the hill to the North of the village. Shiro you are a travelled
man, moreso then any of our number. You must know what we can
do,&quot; the elder said frantically.</P>

<P> Shiro just shook his head in amazement, for all the stories
of dragons and knights he had never seen one either. And he was
definitly no warrior to face the fearsome beast on his own.</P>

<P> The elder continued, &quot;Please Shiro it is said that your
music can soothe even the most savage of beasts, and the elders
have complete faith in you. We all have complete faith in you.
Shiro you must save us from this aweful threat, we will not make
it through the season without our livestock not to mention our
silver.&quot;</P>

<P> Shiro replied in a proud voice, &quot;You can believe that
I will do my best to save the village without endagering the lives
of any of you, my friends.&quot;</P>

<P> Katrina yelled in opposition, &quot;Shiro you're mad it will
kill you in an instant. You don't stand a chance against a dragon.
I beg you please dont go.&quot;</P>

<P> &quot;Katrina worry not for me, I will be ok, it will not
even think of harming me. I'll have him eating out of my hand
in a matter of moments,&quot; he replied in an unconvincing voice.
And with this he mounted his horse which had been brought from
the stables. He then galloped off towards the hill.</P>

<P> Katrina chased after him with tears running down her lovely
face yelling, &quot;I love you Shiro, please don't leave me!!!!&quot;
But her cries were falling on deaf ears for he was to far away
to hear her shouts confessing her love.</P>

<P> As Shiro approached the dragon he immediately sensed a great
aura of evil, so great was this beast that it didn't even turn
its head to look at him when it spoke. &quot;So have you brought
the silver and sheep or must I destroy the village little man?&quot;</P>

<P> Shiro gave no reply but started to play his mandolin better
then he had ever played it before. The dragons head began to weave
back and forth with the melody, and very slowly its head fell
to the ground with a thump. About an hour had passed since he
had come upon the dragon and he was putting his instrument away
when he heard a scream from behind telling him to move. He turned
around at that instant to see another dragon that had been prepared
to strike him down, the dragon had also turned to see Katrina.
Before he even thought about what happened, the monster hit Katrina
across the face with a gnarled claw. She was knocked about twenty
feet into a distant tree. Shiro let out a cry of anger and sorrow
as he again to play his madolin, and it is said that tune was
heard miles away. He played with all of his heart and soul in
effort to charm the second beast to sleep.</P>

<P> Before the dragon was fully out, in one final attempt to save
its life, it released a great blast of fire at the bard. Shiro
cried out from the pain but still he kept playing. He felt his
skin burning away, the pain was awful, it hurt so bad but still
he kept playing. The dragon finally slept and Shiro collapsed
in a pile, smoke still coming off of his burnt form. He slowly
crawled over to where Katrina's body lay in the grass. When he
reached in a last fit of lifehe grasped her hand in what was left
of his and said in a rough gravel-like voice, &quot;I love you
Katrina with all my heart . . .&quot; And he expired into the
night.</P>

<P> It has been four years since the start of the Dragon Wars
and the forces of light are about to overcome and defeat evil,
but here I stand in a temple devoted to the dragons of light.
I stand here in a chamber off from the main rooms and the altar
room. The chamber I'm in was built to accomodate the bodies of
Shiro Legendmaker and his beloved Katrina. It is said that at
the moment of Shiro's death he finally realized the story he had
been looking for his whole life, he had lived in those last few
moments with Katrina. His story is told by bards across the face
of the world as the greatest love story in all the lands. Those
on the search for peace of mind, tranquility, or just to think
about their own love for another, come to this chamber and see
the twin caskets of the true loves and the only thing to survive
the dragons flame. Shiro's Mandolin. Most scholars believe that
the mandolin has the ability to charm man and beast alike, but
we bards agree that it was true love and talent that gave the
instument the abilities it had.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P> Now you know the story of Shiro and Katrina, and I charge
you with the task of telling it to any you meet who are confused
or just unknown to the virtues of love...</P>
