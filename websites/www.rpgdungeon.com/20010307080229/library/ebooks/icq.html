<P>An Important Story</P>

<P>This is not your typical thing you would find in the ICQ greetings.
But, sometimes we come across things that need to get out on the
net. So I ask you to please take some time out of your busy life
and read this for I feel it is very important. There are no fancy
graphics or blinking smiley faces. But, If just one person gets
the message that it's trying to relay that is worth all the smiles
in the world! <BR>
Share this story with your friends and family who have children
who go on-line. There are sick folks out there.</P>

<P>Shannon could hear the footsteps behind her as she walked toward
home. The thought of being followed made her heart beat faster.
&quot;You're being silly,&quot; she told herself, &quot;no one
is following you.&quot; To be safe, she began to walk faster,
but the footsteps kept up with her pace. She was afraid to look
back and she was glad she was almost home. Shannon said a quick
prayer, &quot;God please get me home safe.&quot; She saw the porch
light burning and ran the rest of the way to her house. Once inside,
she leaned against the door for a moment, relieved to be in the
safety of her home. She glanced out the window to see if anyone
was there. The sidewalk was empty.</P>

<P>After tossing her books on the sofa, she decided to grab a
snack and get on-line. She logged on under her screen name ByAngel213.
She checked her Buddy List and saw GoTo123 was on. She sent him
an instant message:</P>

<P>ByAngel213: Hi I'm glad you are on! I thought someone was following
me home today. It was really weird!</P>

<P>GoTo123: LOL You watch too much TV. Why would someone be following
you? Don't you live in a safe neighborhood?</P>

<P>ByAngel213: Of course I do. LOL I guess it was my imagination
cuz' I didn't see anybody when I looked out.</P>

<P>GoTo123: Unless you gave your name out on-line. You haven't
done that have you?</P>

<P>ByAngel213: Of course not. I'm not stupid you know.</P>

<P>GoTo123: Did you have a softball game after school today?</P>

<P>ByAngel213: Yes and we won!!</P>

<P>GoTo123: That's great! Who did you play?</P>

<P>ByAngel213: We played the Hornets. LOL. Their uniforms are
so gross! They look like bees. LOL</P>

<P>GoTo123: What is your team called?</P>

<P>ByAngel213: We are the Canton Cats. We have tiger paws on our
uniforms. They are really kewl.</P>

<P>GoTo123: Did you pitch?</P>

<P>ByAngel213: No I play second base. I got to go. My homework
has to be done before my parents get home. I don't want them mad
at me. Bye</P>

<P>GoTo123: Catch you later.. Bye</P>

<P>Meanwhile......<BR>
GoTo123 went to the member menu and began to search for her profile.
When it came up, he highlighted it and printed it out. He took
out a pen and began to write down what he knew about Angel so
far.</P>

<P>Her name: Shannon <BR>
Birthday: Jan. 3, 1985 <BR>
Age:13 <BR>
State where she lived: North Carolina <BR>
Hobbies: softball, chorus, skating and going to the mall. Besides
this information, he knew she lived in Canton because she had
just told him. He knew she stayed by herself until 6:30 p.m. every
afternoon until her parents came home from work. He knew she played
softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team, and the team
was named the Canton Cats. Her favorite number 7 was printed on
her jersey. He knew she was in the seventh grade at the Canton
Junior High School. She had told him all this in the conversations
they had on-line. He had enough information to find her now.</P>

<P>Shannon didn't tell her parents about the incident on the way
home from the ball park that day. She didn't want them to make
a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games.
Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst. It made
her wish she was not an only child. Maybe if she had brothers
and sisters, her parents wouldn't be so overprotective.</P>

<P>By Thursday, Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following
her. Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone
staring at her. It was then that the memory came back. She glanced
up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely.
He was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled
when she looked at him. He didn't look scary and she quickly dismissed
the fear she had felt. After the game, he sat on a bleacher while
she talked to the coach. She noticed his smile once again as she
walked past him. He nodded and she smiled back. He noticed her
name on the back of her shirt. He knew he had found her. Quietly,
he walked a safe distance behind her. It was only a few blocks
to Shannon's home, and once he saw where she lived he quickly
returned to the park to get his car. Now he had to wait. He decided
to get a bite to eat until the time came to go to Shannon's house.
He drove to a fast food restaurant and sat there until time to
make his move.</P>

<P>Shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices
in the living room. &quot;Shannon, come here,&quot; her father
called. He sounded upset and she couldn't imagine why. She went
into the room to see the man from the ballpark sitting on the
sofa. &quot;Sit down,&quot; her father began, &quot;this man has
just told us a most interesting story about you.&quot;</P>

<P>Shannon moved cautiously to a chair across from the man. How
could he tell her parents anything? She had never seen him before
today!</P>

<P>&quot;Do you know who I am Shannon?&quot; The man asked</P>

<P>&quot;No&quot;, Shannon answered.</P>

<P>&quot;I am a police officer and your online friend, GoTo123.&quot;</P>

<P>Shannon was stunned. &quot;That's impossible! GoTo is a kid
my age! He's 14 and he lives in Michigan!&quot;</P>

<P>The man smiled. &quot;I know I told you all that, but it wasn't
true. You see Shannon there are people on-line who pretend to
be kids; I was one of them. But while others do it to find kids
and hurt them, I belong to a group of parents who do it to protect
kids from predators. I came here to find you to teach you how
dangerous it is to give out too much information to people on-line.
You told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find
you. Your name, the school you went to, the name of your ball
team and the position you played. The number and name on your
jersey just made finding you a breeze.&quot;</P>

<P>Shannon was stunned. &quot;You mean you don't live in Michigan?&quot;</P>

<P>He laughed. &quot;No, I live in Raleigh. It made you feel safe
to think I was so far away, didn't it?&quot; She nodded. &quot;I
had a friend whose daughter was like you. Only she wasn't as lucky.
The guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone. Kids
are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone, yet they do
it all the time on-line. The wrong people trick you into giving
out information a little here and there on-line. Before you know
it, you have told them enough for them to find you without even
realizing you have done it. I hope you've learned a lesson from
this and won't do it again.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I won't,&quot; Shannon promised solemnly.</P>

<P>&quot;Will you tell others about this so they will be safe
too?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's a promise!&quot; That night Shannon and her dad
and Mom all knelt down together and prayed. They thanked God for
protecting Shannon from what could have been a tragic situation.</P>

<P>Please send this to as many people as you can to teach them
not to give any information about themselves. This world we live
in today is too dangerous to even give out your age, let alone
anything else.</P>

<P>Be safe.</P>

<P>PLEASE PASS THIS ON! <BR>
