The rising sun forced Daric's eyes open. Squinting, he tried to
get them to adjust to the light, and then quickly screwed them
shut, trying to keep the light away. After a moment, he opened
them again, slightly.</P>

<P>&quot;Brian?&quot; he asked, once he realized that he did not
hear anything else except birds and horses. &quot;Quint?&quot;
He jumped to his feet, eyes wide open. &quot;Brian! Quint!&quot;
Silence. Suddenly Edwina nickered and Daric jumped, his heart
racing with fright. &quot;Don't do that again,&quot; he admonished
the horse who looked guilty. &quot;But I don't suppose you know
where they've gone, do you?&quot; He paused. &quot;Great, I'm
talking to a horse, and it's not as if she can say something back.&quot;
And once the idea was brought up, his mind grabbed it, swiftly
creating a song about a talking horse. &quot;Not now,&quot; he
irritably told himself. &quot;You can work on that horse is a
horse thing later. Right now I have to figure out what happened
to Brian and Quint.&quot; He paused, gathering this thoughts.
&quot;Well, I know that one of two things happened: one, they're
not far away and plan on coming back or two, they ran into the
enemy. I know they did not willing leave me because Edwina is
still here.&quot; Sighing, he made his way to the horse and started
stroking her head. &quot;So what do I do now?&quot;</P>

<P>| Keep heading toward Pathageron. | A decent plan Daric admitted.</P>

<P>Do I have any other better ideas? The trainee counted to ten
and his mind remained blank. All right, then, on to Pathageron
it is. For a moment, he stopped, deciding what to do with the
horses. Obviously he had to bring Edwina otherwise Quint would
kill him the next he saw her. But neither he nor Brian were as
attached to their horses and one horse would be so much easier
to maneuver through the mountains than three . . . he sighed,
then took up the reins of his and Brian's horses.</P>

<P>&quot;Is it okay if I ride you, Edwina?&quot; he questioned.
The horse nodded, her mane flying up and down. &quot;And will
you help me make sure these other two horses don't stray too much?&quot;
Once again she nodded and Daric felt his eyebrows raise. &quot;Can
you really understand what I'm saying?&quot; Nod. &quot;You're
one of the strangest animals I've ever met.&quot; At that, Edwina
shook her head in denial, and then pushed her nose into his shoulder
slightly. &quot;Me? I am not the strangest animal I've ever met!&quot;
Edwina seemed to be laughing. Brian snorted in frustration and
mounted her.</P>

<P>Off I go to the palace to meet the king. By myself. No Brian,
no Quint. And if they have been captured, I may be the only bard
trainee left in the kingdom. He felt himself go cold at that thought.
But if they haven't been, or if they get free, then I'll meet
up with them later. Oh, gods, what trouble.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Brian lay trussed up next to Quint. Brian silently cursed his
stupidity -- he had walked right into the trap, he alone was responsible
for his current position. He should have known that Lyon would
know what he wanted, that he would be waiting. He should have
seen everything . . . he internally sighed. His eyes had been
blind, caught up in only his thoughts, not the thoughts of others.
So now he lay next to Quint, tied up even as she was at the wrists
and ankles with a rag placed over his mouth. Harley stood outside,
making sure no one else could get into the tent without the presence
of Rowan or Lyon. Stifling another sigh, Brian thought of Daric.
The poor boy was probably scared out of his wits wondering what
had happened to the two of them, and Brian did not blame him.
If put in the same situation, he knew he would have lost his head
before he had even woken up. Perhaps a glimmer of hope still remained
with the free trainee -- if only he could figure out that they
had been captured and just did not abandon him then he would come
in search of them. Slightly shaking his head, Brian threw away
the thought. Daric would just get caught and thrown in with them
or else killed in the process. It would be best if the boy just
left, thinking they had left him -- this was definitely not a
time for heroics.</P>

<P>He wished he could ask Quint how she was holding up, to see
if she carried all that guilt he had caught a glimpse of during
the night. But he could not. All he could do was lie on the floor,
waiting for something, anything to happen. His mind circled around,
thinking of how one thing, anything could have, should have, been
different: If only I had thought about where Lyon would be . .
. if only I had known about Quint's burden . . . if only I could
have stopped the Lyceum from burning. Then he realized how impossible
his thoughts were -- he could not change the past, no matter how
hard he wished.</P>

<P>The tent flaps opened and Lyon and Rowan stepped inside.</P>

<P>&quot;Now that you're here, Quint,&quot; the two ignored Brian
completely. &quot;The gods have ordered us to start marching toward
Pathageron. I hope you both are ready for the trip.&quot; Rowan's
eyes flashed across to Brian and then back to Quint. &quot;As
of now, his life is in your hands, Quint. If you do one thing
wrong, he will pay for it, perhaps with his life. Do you understand?&quot;
She nodded. &quot;Good.&quot; He looked at Lyon, who stepped outside
quickly, and when he came back in, two soldiers were with them.
&quot;Then let's go.&quot; He motioned to the soldiers. &quot;These
men will make your trip as comfortable as possible. Enjoy.&quot;
Then he and Lyon left.</P>

<P>The soldiers cut their bonds, and with a tight grip on their
shoulders which discouraged any fighting, led them to two horses
waiting outside. After mounting, the trainee's hands were then
retied to the pommel of their horses' saddle. One of the soldiers
darkly muttered something about baby-sitting under his breath.
Brian wished he could let the guard know the feeling was mutual.
Their guards then tied a rope from the trainees' mounts' reins
to the saddles of their own horses. In this way, although the
trainees could not steer, the horses would not wander. Fluidly,
the soldiers mounted, nudging their horses to the middle of the
army. Without argument, the trainee's horses followed. Soon after,
they started moving.</P>

<P>They did not stop all day and Brian felt sorry for anybody
who might be on foot. Lunch was eaten in the saddle, a prospect
Brian never wanted to duplicate again. Finally, with about a quarter
of a position left of sunlight, they stopped. Immediately all
of the soldiers went to work in readying the camp.</P>

<P>The soldier guarding Brian cut his bonds then led him over
to where they were keeping the horses for the night.</P>

<P>Oh, no, Brian thought and tried to twist away, but the soldier's
grip was too tight. They reached a nearby tree and the guard pushed
Brian to the ground, tying him to the oak. Again. Trees are starting
to become my best friend. A nearby horse urinated at his feet
and Brian's eyes rolled toward the sky. What else could go wrong?
One lone rain drop fell onto his upturned nose. Great. What trouble.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Quint awoke and noted that it was still raining, as it had
been for the past four positions or so. It was finally starting
to soak through the tent she was in and she shifted, trying to
get herself further away from the puddle which was forming. Rhythmically,
she heard water falling into the forming puddle. Once again she
struggled against the bonds which held her, and once again, it
resulted in futility.</P>

<P>Oh, gods, she sent the thought out, surrounded with want and
need. Why are you all so against me? Isn't there one of you who
is willing to help me, instead of trying to kill me? Suddenly
a great jolt of energy echoed throughout her mind and somehow
she sat up in wonderment. Outside, a mighty roar reverberated
through the camp -- a roar that matched in majesty the jolt in
her head. The soldier who was guarding her, rushed into the tent,
quickly severing the bonds which tied her ankles, and propelled
her out into the rain, and toward the tent Rowan had had erected
for himself. But suddenly -- a flash of golden fur and the man
who had held her stumbled, clutching at his throat which had been
jaggedly slashed, blood pouring out in a torrent, mixing with
rain, and he fell to the ground, his eyes already glazed over
in death. Quint looked around for the animal who had done the
deed for surely no human could do it, but saw nothing but screaming,
frightened men.</P>

<P>&quot;Quint!&quot; Brian's voice pierced the din and reached
her ears. Suddenly he was there, cutting the ropes which held
her wrists together with his dagger. After removing her gag, he
held her tight, as if to reassure himself that she was actually
there. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</P>

<P>She nodded, not trusting her voice. In her mind, she still
saw the death of the guard.</P>

<P>&quot;We've got to get out of here.&quot; He grabbed her arm
and pulled her toward where the horses had been tied up for the
night. Throwing her the reins of one of the horses, Brian urged
her to hurry. &quot;I don't know what that thing is, but it's
given us the perfect opportunity to get out of here!&quot; He
kicked his horse and it bounded away with Quint following right
behind him.</P>

<P>About forty marks away from the camp, they slowed the horses
down to a gentle walk, allowing them to cool down and catch their
breath. Almost simultaneously, the trainees sighed and then grinned
at each other in their shared relief.</P>

<P>&quot;Do you think Daric is all right?&quot; Brian had worried
about the young trainee most of the night -- or at least when
he was not worrying about their own situation.</P>

<P>Quint shrugged, suddenly feeling sorry for Daric. &quot;I really
don't know. Lyon didn't say anything about finding him but that
doesn't mean too much. I wish he knew that we didn't run off,
he's probably worried out of his mind.&quot;</P>

<P>Silently, the two plodded on through the night. They did not
push the horses, not wanting to wear them out. But as the sun
was starting to rise over the mountain tops, Quint caught sight
of a small cave in one of the sides of a hill.</P>

<P>&quot;Look,&quot; Quint pointed. &quot;We should stop there.
I know we don't have any food but the rest would do us good.&quot;</P>

<P>Brian quickly agreed, numb to the bone with tiredness and then
the excitement from last night -- his adrenaline rush had worn
off long ago. They dismounted, leading the two very weary horses
in. Taking off the saddles, they rubbed the horses down with their
cloaks and patted their heads to calm them. Gathering a few loose
branches and twigs from inside the cave, Brian soon had a small
fire burning inside, slowly drying his wet clothes. Quint came
over and encircled her arms around his chest.</P>

<P>&quot;How are you doing?&quot; she questioned while massaging
his back.</P>

<P>&quot;Better now,&quot; Brian replied then grimaced as she
hit a particularly sore spot. &quot;Yes, right there. Oh, much
better, thank you.&quot; He rolled his shoulders in circles, trying
to get more of the tension out. Quint kissed him on the side of
the neck and then stood up and made her way to a large rock.</P>

<P>Leaning against it, she closed her eyes, her thoughts on the
animal which had attacked the camp. She did not want to talk about
it -- it was too fresh in her mind. Shuddering, she remembered
how the man's blood had flowed out of his body . . .</P>

<P>Stop that, she told herself. And shortly after, she feel into
a deep, dreamless sleep.<BR>
</P>

<P>Rowan poked his head outside the tent where he had been waiting,
drawn sword in hand, for the thing -- whatever it was -- to attack
him. Yet the sounds of turmoil faded even as he looked around
and the camp fell into order: fixing things that had been broken,
dragging off the bodies of slain men, and setting up a full guard
around the area.</P>

<P>&quot;Sire,&quot; called one of the soldiers, a lieutenant
who had happened to see the prince's red hair. &quot;I believe
I know the full extent of damage caused by the magical creature
which attacked us.&quot;</P>

<P>Magical he says, Rowan thought. That I truly doubt, but I will
not contradict him until I know the truth of what happened tonight.
&quot;Come in, Lieutenant,&quot; Rowan held the flap open.</P>

<P>&quot;Sire,&quot; the lieutenant nervously turned toward his
superior. &quot;Do you, or anyone,&quot; his quick glance to Eldson
assured Rowan of his thoughts, &quot;know anything about our attacker?&quot;</P>

<P>Rowan looked at Eldson who shook his head. &quot;No. Personally,
I believe that it is the work of my brother, trying to scare my
men away from me.&quot;</P>

<P>The soldier straightened his back and firmly faced his prince.
&quot;It will take a lot more than that to scare us away, sire.&quot;</P>

<P>Inwardly smiling, Rowan replied, &quot;Good. Now about that
report . . . &quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, sire. Approximately half of the camp was attacked
and nearly a quarter of the tents are beyond repair while almost
the same number are ripped and torn but can be repaired. Around
ten men are wounded or dead after confronting the beast. And .
. . &quot; he paused, waiting for Rowan's nod to continue. &quot;The
boy, Brian, has escaped along with the girl.&quot; Hurriedly he
spat out the words and turned his eyes to a wall behind Rowan,
fearing to look into his eyes.</P>

<P>Rowan let go of the breath he had been holding, half expecting
the words he had just heard. He tore his eyes away from the soldier
and faced a nearby tent wall. &quot;Find her, Lieutenant. I don't
care about the boy, in fact, he is a bigger pain with us than
not with us, but the girl is important. Take ten men and search
for her -- I do not want to see you again until you have her at
your side.&quot;</P>

<P>The Lieutenant quickly bowed out, thankful for still having
his head attached to his shoulders and not wanting to test his
leader's generosity any further.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Quint woke up suddenly, some weird sense telling her that something
was outside the cave. Softly so as to not wake Brian from needed
rest, she stood up and neared the mouth of the cave. The sun was
on its way up and from its glow, she saw a shadow moving around.
Hoping to go unnoticed, she slinked out of the cave, trying to
catch sight of the person. Suddenly, she was knocked to the ground
as a man from behind her flattened himself on top of her. With
the wind knocked out of her, she lay on the ground, trying to
gather herself.</P>

<P>Stupid, Quint. You are so stupid.</P>

<P>Then, a roar and the man on top of her got up, eyes wide, face
white with fear. A slight growl and the man ran. Quint turned
to see a huge animal with golden fur leap over her, pursuing the
other man. She gasped, recognizing the animal, and got to her
feet, running back to the cave.</P>

<P>&quot;Brian,&quot; she wheezed upon entering.</P>

<P>&quot;Quint! Where have you been? What's going on?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Lion . . . &quot; Quint tried to catch her skittering
breath. Taking a few deep breaths, she managed to control her
emotions. &quot;There's a lion out there. I heard something moving
around outside, so I went out to see what was going on. A man,
he was probably one of Rowan's men trying to find us, knocked
me down and then there was this lion. The man ran away, and the
lion followed him. Brian, we can't stay here -- not with a lion
around! He'll kill us!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;If we hurry, he'll still be too busy with that other
man to notice us quietly making our way out of here.&quot; Brian
ran to the horses, bringing them to the front of the cave.</P>

<P>Quint picked up both of their saddles and gave Brian's to him.
With more speed than ever before, they readied their horses and
mounted. A quick glance to each other and they were off, urging
the horses faster and faster until they had left the cave twenty
marks behind them.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The lion returned to the cave where Quint and Brian had slept.
Eyes quickly adjusting to the darkness within, he studied the
dirt floor, reading its signs. They had left in a hurry and not
long ago. He could still catch up with them. With tail flowing
behind him, he left, following the tracks of those before him.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The lieutenant whom Rowan had sent out to find Quint caught
his breath and studied the frightened men in front of him.</P>

<P>&quot;We can't go back,&quot; he reminded them. &quot;Not without
the girl unless you want the Prince to take our heads.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;But we can't keep chasing her -- not if she's got a lion
protecting her,&quot; one of the men objected.</P>

<P>The lieutenant stopped, thinking. &quot;There's a small village
not too far from here. We could pretend that this part of our
life never existed.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wha' 'bout our loya'ty to the Cap?&quot; Another man
piped up.</P>

<P>&quot;I don't see a lot of reason to follow a man who would
cut my head off without regards as to why the mission failed.
He failed a mission once, and the gods gave him another chance,
yet he won't do the same for us. Personally, that's not the sign
of a good leader, and I don't want to be under his leadership
anymore. You men can go back and tell him we didn't catch her
-- that a lion scared us away from his prize. All people will
find of you is your drawn and quartered body. But it's your choice.&quot;
He turned away, nudging his horse toward the village. After a
few moments, he heard all ten men behind him and smiled.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Darkness was overtaking the land before Quint and Brian came
across a small town for them to stop in. They had agreed, both
with relief, to sleep within civilization for the next couple
of nights -- until thoughts of lions and such creatures had disappeared
from their minds. Wandering into the town, Judan its sign proclaimed,
they immediately started looking for the wooden sign with two
mugs painted upon it. Neither of the trainees had money, and they
knew they would have to perform for their supper and bed. Not
that that was going to bother them -- it had been too long since
they had sung for anyone except each other; they felt out of practice.</P>

<P>Soon they reached The Wandering Duck, a solid looking inn with
a warm glow coming out from underneath the door. They handed their
horses over to the stable hand and walked inside, both grinning
at the presence of other people and the air of leisure. A juggler
stood on a small stage to the left of the common room.</P>

<P>&quot;Can I help you?&quot; one of the serving girls approached.</P>

<P>&quot;We'd like to talk to the owner of the inn -- we're Bards.&quot;
Brian stretched the truth slightly.</P>

<P>The girl nodded. &quot;Let me go find him. Stay right there.&quot;</P>

<P>It was a good crowd, nobody appeared ready to start a fight
at the drop of a hat nor was anybody pawing the serving girls
at every turn. The floor, though full of dirt, had not much in
the way of food on it. Some help there probably came from the
two big mastiffs lying next to the warm fire. Soon a fat man with
curly brown hair and sparkling blue eyes made his way toward them.</P>

<P>&quot;A Mistress and Master of Music, huh? You look mighty
young.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We just newly graduated to the title,&quot; Quint proclaimed.</P>

<P>&quot;What instruments do you play?&quot;</P>

<P>The trainees glanced at each other. &quot;We don't,&quot; Brian
stated simply. &quot;We sing.&quot;</P>

<P>The Master of the Inn eyed the two over. &quot;You don't, huh?
Well, as long as you don't bring your trouble into here, I don't
care as long as you bring in the customers. Here's the normal
deal: I get twenty percent of your take, and you get a room and
a meal.&quot;</P>

<P>Brian broke into a smile. &quot;You've got a deal.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Do you want your meal before you sing or during a break?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;During a break,&quot; Quint replied, knowing the hot
meal which would be sitting in their stomachs would only make
them sleepy.</P>

<P>The Master of the Inn nodded. &quot;All right. Just let one
of the girls know when you get hungry -- they'll get you something.
You'll be on right after the juggler here so sit down and watch
the crowd for a little while. I'll have Rose, that's the girl
you met earlier, come over and bring you something to drink. She'll
do the same while you're performing.&quot;</P>

<P>Brian smiled. &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;It's Gale to my friends. And you are?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Brian and Quint,&quot; Brian stuck out a hand.</P>

<P>&quot;Quint?&quot; the Master of the Inn wondered. &quot;Are
you fifth born or just part of a quintuplet?&quot;</P>

<P>Quint shrugged. &quot;I don't know my heritage, good sir.&quot;</P>

<P>Gale studied the girl in front of him. &quot;There is a woman
who lives not far outside the village whom, it is told, performs
magic, if you believe in such things, and can find out the answer
to any unknown. I can give you directions in the morning if you
wish.&quot;</P>

<P>Something moved within Quint, and she realized they were destined
to find this woman. &quot;Yes, thank you. I'd like that very much.&quot;</P>

<P>Suddenly the juggler bowed, and Gale started. &quot;That's
your clue, my Bards. Rose will be right over. Good luck.&quot;
He scurried away, back into the kitchen as Brian and Quint took
their places on the stage.</P>

<P>Brian glanced at Quint, noticing her worn and traveled clothing
and knew he looked no better. Instantly, without prologue, he
burst into a rollicking song:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>I've been traveling twenty-four days</P>

<P>without one stop and without one bath</P>

<P>wandering about in a broken haze.</P>

<P>Following what seems an unknown path</P>

<P>and where I'll stop? Who's to say.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>And the tone was set for the rest of the night. The patrons
asked for &quot;The Lonesome Maiden&quot; and &quot;Kindred Spirits&quot;
around six times and sang along every time they were played. From
outside, people would hear the singing, stop by for a draught
of ale and stay at least long enough to listen to their favorite
song. Two hours later, when the trainees stopped for a break,
they had gathered twenty copper pieces in the mug Rose had set
on the stage for them.</P>

<P>Brian grinned at his beloved as they sat down at a table. &quot;Now
that's fun.&quot;</P>

<P>Quint laughed wearily. &quot;It's been a long while since we've
done anything of the sort.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yea,&quot; Brian agreed. &quot;Since our year-mates dared
us to sing all night to the sky on top of that hill by the Lyceum.&quot;</P>

<P>Quint grinned, remembering the event. &quot;I remember not
having a voice for four days.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I remember having a cold for a week,&quot; Brian added.</P>

<P>&quot;At least you got out of class that way,&quot; Quint reminded.
&quot;You didn't have to sing for Master of Music Galvin sounding
like a frog.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You're just jealous,&quot; Brian joked.</P>

<P>Just then Rose brought them two plates of steaming meat and
vegetables. Quint's stomach growled at the smell, and she started,
realizing that it had been over a day since they had last eaten.
She picked up her fork and knife, quickly starting on the tender
beef. It was not long before both of their plates were clean and
they were back on the small stage.</P>

<P>During the second half of the show, the men, having drunk a
lot of ale during the break, were more noisy than before. But
that was okay because as long as they had nothing else to drink,
they would not become riotous and would just dip in their wallets
to show the singers how much they had enjoyed them. As the moon
rose high in the sky, the trainees stepped down from the stage,
throats parched and weary, ready for bed.</P>

<P>Gale appeared as if from darkness, nearing the table where
the two tiredly slumped. &quot;Your rooms are ready,&quot; he
stated. &quot;Rose will you show you to them and in the morning,
we will talk.&quot;</P>

<P>Rose stood behind the man and motioned for the two to follow.
Climbing up two flights of stairs, seemingly one of the longest
treks of their lives, she opened one door for Quint and the room
next door for Brian.</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks,&quot; Quint yawned, and Rose grinned, her brown
eyes full of laughter.</P>

<P>&quot;Sleep well,&quot; the woman replied, and Quint knew she
would.</P>

<P>Outside the small town of Judan the lion waited in shadows,
promising to protect the one who needed his help.</P>

<P>Waking, Brian stretched, his mind still full of cobwebs of
dreams and sleep. Shaking them away, he clambered off the bed,
putting on his boots, for he had slept in his clothes. Opening
the door he noticed that the door to the room Quint had been given
was still closed. With a slight smile, he decided not to bother
her, letting her wake up on her own accord. Going downstairs,
he watched with interested eyes as Rose and the other serving
girls bustled around, cleaning up rooms from the activities of
the night before.</P>

<P>&quot;Rose,&quot; he caught the girl. &quot;Where's Master
Gale?&quot; He had counted the money they had earned last night
and wanted to give the Master of the Inn his percentage.</P>

<P>&quot;Back in the kitchen,&quot; she motioned the direction
with her head.</P>

<P>&quot;Thanks.&quot; Even after paying the man, he and Quint
had forty cooper pieces. That was more than enough to house them
at an inn, with proper meals, for the next four days without their
having to work.</P>

<P>&quot;You're finally up,&quot; the booming voice made him smile.
Brian turned to see the smiling Master of the Inn behind him.
&quot;How'd you sleep?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wonderfully,&quot; Brian replied. He reached into his
wallet. &quot;Here's your percentage from last night.&quot; He
handed the man ten copper coins.</P>

<P>Gale counted the money then glanced at the boy. &quot;Not bad
for singing all night.&quot; Motioning for Brian to follow him,
he led the trainee to his office. &quot;I don't mean to pry but
I've got to ask you a question -- mainly because I want to help
you. For some strange reason, the gods gave me a dream last night.
In it you and the girl were hanging, dead, from a tree and a man
with red hair was there, laughing at the sight of your corpses.&quot;
He crossed his arms and glared at Brian. &quot;Now I can tell
you that I don't much appreciate this sort of dream so I just
want to know -- what kind of trouble are you two in?&quot;</P>

<P>Brian had been sitting there, gaping, since the Master of the
Inn had first started off. &quot;I don't know . . . &quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The gods themselves have invited me to become a part
of your troubles, and I want to know why.&quot;</P>

<P>Without warning, Brian found himself talking, telling Gale
everything he had seen and heard, not seeing reason to omit anything.
By the end he was winded, and the Master of the Inn nodded in
belief.</P>

<P>&quot;Gods want her killed, huh? We shall see about that. You
must go to see Holly, she's the one I spoke of last night. She
will help you, and I will help you in anyway I can.&quot; He opened
the door to the office. &quot;Rose,&quot; he called, and she quickly
approached. &quot;I want you to fix our two songbirds enough food
to last them a week.&quot; She nodded and disappeared from Brian's
sight. &quot;Once Quint awakens, you'll eat and then be on your
way. I'll ride with you to Holly's place.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Brian wondered. &quot;I mean, just
because you think the gods gave you a dream and you didn't just
have a normal nightmare . . . &quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I've made up my mind, songster, and that's all there
is to it. No more discussions.&quot; The Master of the Inn drew
a line across his neck, signaling the end. Gale turned around,
and his eyes alighted upon a deck of cards. &quot;You want to
play some until the other one gets down?&quot;</P>

<P>Brian grinned. &quot;Sure, but let me warn you, I've been known
to have uncanny luck at times.&quot;</P>

<P>Gale gave him a huge smile. &quot;Me too.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Quint slowly wakened, every sense fighting for her to regain
sleep, yet as always, her mind won and started thinking until
the rest of her body had to follow. Sitting up, she ran fingers
through her hair, slightly smoothing it and getting a few knots
out. Immediately she fell back into bed, wanting to rest some
more. With a sigh, she sat up again, pulled on her boots, laced
them up, and stood. Opening the door, she peered out and noted
that Brian had already risen. From downstairs she heard Brian's
voice singing a song from last night. Slightly grinning at her
beloved's voice, she went downstairs to greet the people and the
day. Rose saw her enter the room and came to her side.</P>

<P>&quot;Morning,&quot; she greeted. &quot;Master Gale and Brian
are playing cards. Every time Gale loses he adds another days
worth of food in a bag for you two. If Brian loses, he has to
him teach a song -- Gale's a collector of songs. Poor boy, he's
turning into a bird, and the sack of food hasn't gotten any heavier.&quot;
She giggled.</P>

<P>Just then Brian saw her. &quot;Oh, Quint,&quot; he started.
&quot;You're finally awake.&quot;</P>

<P>Gale burst into a hearty laugh, his face turning red. &quot;Don't
take it so hard, songster. I'm just older and know some tricks
you don't.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yea,&quot; Brian muttered. &quot;Like how to stuff four
aces up your sleeve at the same time.&quot;</P>

<P>His words made the Master of the Inn laugh harder. &quot;It's
luck, boy. Pure and simple luck. Now how about that breakfast
to soothe a sore throat?&quot;</P>

<P>Quint joined the men at the table. &quot;I take it you men
have been having a good morning.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;One man better than the other,&quot; Gale grinned, winking
an eye at Brian. Rose set down three plates full of meat and a
potato. &quot;Now eat up so we can be on our way.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We?&quot; Quint questioned.</P>

<P>&quot;Gale is going to ride with us to Holly's place,&quot;
Brian explained.</P>

<P>&quot;Holly? Who's Holly?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;She's the lady I was telling you about last night,&quot;
Gale clarified as Quint nodded. &quot;Figured I should take you
there myself so that you couldn't come back and say I had gotten
you lost purposely.&quot;</P>

<P>The three quickly ate, wanting to start the trek as soon as
possible. Within half a position they were ready, the sack of
food Gale had given the trainees tied onto the saddle of Brian's
horse. As they walked down the street, the horses kicking up dirt
at every step, Quint felt safe for the first time in days.</P>

<P>&quot;How long will it take us to get there?&quot; she wondered.</P>

<P>&quot;A little less than a position,&quot; Gale replied. &quot;It's
really not too far.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What do you know about her?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;About as much as any other townsman which isn't much
all told. She came here around five years ago and set up as a
wise woman. Claimed she could talk to the gods and all that. I
think she has some of the gods in her because she has magic. Once
saw her kill a horseman with a single word.&quot;</P>

<P>Quint's mouth gaped. Magic. All of the old ballads talked of
such a thing existing in the world -- she knew the words to every
song which even implied its use. And to suddenly hear that it
really existed, that it was not something only in the past that
could no longer be attained in the present . . . the thought had
always scared and excited her. To be able to hold such power --
the power of the gods. How glorious it must be to control the
earth and sky. I've always wanted to hold magic, she thought.
And now I'm about to meet someone who does. She sighed. If only
that person could be me. What trouble.</P>

<P>Soon they came upon a small cottage situated deep within a
forest. Vines crept up the walls, making an aura of disrepair
and eerieness. Gale dismounted and went up to the wooden door,
knocking three times. Brian and Quint stayed back slightly, still
on their horses, waiting to see what Holly would do upon answering
Gale's knocks. Suddenly a young woman appeared between the trainees.</P>

<P>&quot;Whom does that man seek?&quot; the newcomer wondered.
&quot;There is no one inside.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We're looking for one named Holly,&quot; Brian looked
down at the woman.</P>

<P>&quot;Many come looking for her,&quot; she replied.</P>

<P>Quint glanced at the woman and stared, feeling like she should
know the face. Long blond hair that reached the middle of the
back, wide green eyes, full red lips . . . &quot;Holly!&quot;
She hopped off her horse to give the woman a hug.</P>

<P>Holly energetically returned the gift. &quot;It's great to
see you, Quint.&quot;</P>

<P>Gale had returned to the group after noticing the sudden commotion.
&quot;You didn't tell me you knew her,&quot; he chided.</P>

<P>&quot;I didn't know I did,&quot; she answered, a smile on her
face. &quot;How was I to know that my childhood friend was a backwoods
Mistress of Magic?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;How indeed,&quot; Holly returned. &quot;But I'm being
rude -- why don't we all go inside?&quot; Stepping forward, she
opened the door and motioned everyone inside.</P>

<P>&quot;What about the horses?&quot; Brian wondered, dismounting.</P>

<P>&quot;They'll be all right. They won't roam -- not in here.&quot;
Once inside, the hostess turned toward Brian. &quot;I don't believe
I've gotten your name.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Brian.&quot; He stuck out a hand which Holly firmly grasped.
&quot;And you're Holly, Quint's childhood friend.&quot;</P>

<P>Holly grinned. &quot;You make it sound like I was her only
friend.&quot; Glancing at Quint, she laughed. &quot;Then again,
maybe I was.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Stop right there,&quot; Quint commanded, a twinkle in
her eye. &quot;This is still Pick-on-Brian-Day, and you are not
about to turn it into Pick-on-Quint-Day.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I guess this conversation will have to wait until tomorrow,&quot;
Holly not-so-quietly whispered to Brian who smiled conspiratorially.
&quot;But I figure you didn't travel all this way for a reunion
. . .&quot;</P>

<P>Quint shook her head, sadly. &quot;Not in the slightest.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Then why? Who will tell the story?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I will,&quot; Quint quickly answered and without prelude,
told her friend everything which had occurred, Brian cutting in
with details once or twice. &quot;Now here we are, and that's
the end of the tale.&quot;</P>

<P>Holly narrowed her eyes. &quot;Well, I think we can take care
of at least one of your problems right now. Follow me.&quot; She
stepped outside and walked to the edge of the grass which circled
her home. Closing her eyes, she sent a mental line out toward
her teacher. His reply was a roar, and she felt him running to
meet her. She opened her eyes to see a pale and shaking Quint.</P>

<P>&quot;That sounded like a lion,&quot; she stuttered.</P>

<P>&quot;It was.&quot; Holly did nothing at all to soothe Quint's
fear, and she knew it. But time for explanations were at hand.</P>

<P>| Be calm. | The thought entered Quint's head uninvited. Just
then the lion stepped out of the foliage. Quint eyed the animal
and took a small step forward. &quot;You just talked to me.&quot;
she accused.</P>

<P>The lion nodded. | Yes, | he spoke into the minds of all four
humans. | I have the power to communicate with you. |</P>

<P>&quot;Who are you?&quot; Brian questioned, his voice wavering
only slightly.</P>

<P>| Ari. | The lion seemed to bow. | I was once Holly's teacher
but am now here to help Quint. |</P>

<P>&quot;Why?&quot; Quint shot out.</P>

<P>| Because some of the gods wish to destroy you, and I must
teach you how to protect yourself. You have within yourself the
gift to control and create magic -- I will teach you how to harness
your capabilities. Just as I taught Holly the same lessons years
ago. |</P>

<P>&quot;What are you?&quot; Brian wondered. &quot;What are you
that you can recognize ability in people and can teach them how
to control it?&quot; His voice held skepticism.</P>

<P>| I am a god. | The answer was simple and allowed no questions.</P>

<P>&quot;Why do you want to help me?&quot; Quint inquired. &quot;All
the other gods want me dead -- why are you different?&quot;</P>

<P>Ari sighed though a sense of laughter came through the noise.
| Questions, questions. | His tone turned serious. | Believe in
me. I am here to help you. Or have you forgotten what lies beneath
that leather on your hand? The same thing which Holly has on her
hand . . . |</P>

<P>Quint glanced at her friend then met the lion's eyes. &quot;I
believe you for only a god could know something like that.&quot;</P>

<P>Brian stood confused. He looked at Holly's hands but saw nothing
on either of them. What is he talking about? He paused. Then again,
Holly is a Mistress of Magic and maybe she can hide whatever it
is.</P>

<P>The lion turned to face Gale. | Gale, Master of the Inn, I
have for you a mission. |</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, golden god,&quot; Gale hesitantly said.</P>

<P>| You are to go back to Judan and tell your village, and the
other nearby villages, of Rowan and his intents. If possible,
anyone who is able should try to hinder the progress of his army.
Anyone who helps will be rewarded greatly by my father. |</P>

<P>Gale wet his lips with his tongue. &quot;But golden god, nobody
will believe me when I say that this is your wish.&quot;</P>

<P>The lion bobbed his head, growled slightly, and suddenly something
that glinted in the sunlight laid on the dirt in front of the
animal. | Take this ring with you, Master Gale. On it is my likeness,
and it is your proof. If still they will not trust your words,
then say, &quot;So be it! But when Ari, son of the mighty Alinthon
comes before you, his golden mane shining in the sun and mouth
shooting flames of red, explain to him why you did not obey his
orders.&quot; | Holly burst out laughing, and the god looked at
her, a slight smile twitching on his feline face. | Well, I could
shoot flames from my mouth if I wanted to. |</P>

<P>&quot;Are you really Alinthon's son?&quot; Brian asked breathlessly,
face pale. Alinthon was the head god, ruling above and over seeing
all the other gods.</P>

<P>| Bastard son in reality but I consider it close enough. |
He glanced at Gale who had just picked up the ring from the ground.
| Will you do this for me, Master Gale? |</P>

<P>The Master of the Inn meet the animal's eyes. &quot;Of course,
golden god.&quot; Walking to his horse, he quickly mounted and
waved at the group. &quot;Be well.&quot; And with that, turned
around and galloped back the way they had arrived.</P>

<P>| Now, | Ari started. | It's just us -- except one is still
missing. | He paused. | Daric, oh yes, Daric. | He faced Quint.
| It's time to start your training. Holly, would you mind showing
Brian the waterfall you created? |</P>

<P>&quot;Of course not, teacher.&quot; Turning, she motioned for
Brian to join her.</P>

<P>| Now the real fun begins. | Ari smiled at Quint, showing his
white, sharp canines.</P>
