<P><B>As a Cleric, your power lies in two main areas. The first
area is in your ability to heal and cure the ailments of others.
The second area is your ability to combat the forces of what we
know as the undead.</B></P>

<P><B><U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="+1">Rank I<BR>
</FONT></U><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Minor Healing</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"> - One of the first spells an aspiring Cleric
learns. Minor Healing, like all of the spells in the healing group,
is based on the Cleric's expertise in the arcane skill of Alteration.
This spells is a relatively low power spell, and as such doesn't
require much in the way of mana expenditure. As an Apprentice
Cleric (Rank I), Minor Healing will be your only healing spell.
At higher levels however, you will more choices available to you.
These more potent healing spells require a large expenditure of
mana however, and the Cleric should always remember that he or
she can fall back upon the basic Minor Healing if needed. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Cure Poison</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"> - A basic spell, but one that should never be
forgotten. Not much can be said about this useful spell except,
do not forget you have it. If you or another should chance to
be poisoned, the use of this spell as a cure is much preferred
over the option of letting the poison run its course. Most poisons
occurring naturally in Norrath are slow acting. Thus, even if
you don't currently have this spell memorized, you should have
time to do so before the poison can cause too much damage to the
infected soul. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Spook the Undead</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"> - The first spell in this category that the
Cleric learns doesn't really help to combat the undead directly,
but can still be extremely valuable in this fight if properly
applied. When a Cleric is amid large numbers of these creatures
doing battle, he or she can quickly become overwhelmed. Proper
application of this spell can help the Cleric to scare away extra
targets so he or she can concentrate on just one or two<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="+1">Rank II<BR>
</FONT></U><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Light Healing</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"> - The Cleric's spell of Light Healing is a natural
progression of skill from the less effective Minor Healing. While
Light Healing uses more of the caster's mana to perform its task,
it is also more effective. Speaking strictly mana -vs- effect,
Light Healing is worth the extra expenditure. In addition, when
you have attained the experience of higher ranks, and thus more
efficient healing spells, never forget that you can fall back
on Light Healing or Minor Healing in emergency situations when
mana is critical. <BR>
As an addendum - Experience has found Light Healing to be the
most efficient spell to use to heal party members amid battle
situations. Using more experienced spells can consume too much
mana, leaving the Cleric without the ability to aid others.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Cure Blindness </FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff">- This spell is one that most Cleric's do not
keep memorized, but always remember its there. It is highly unlikely
that you will need to do a battlefield cure of this obscure disease,
but you may find the need to help one has recently been stricken.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Cure Disease</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"> - Most diseases will be caused by disease carrying
animals. However, since these diseases can very quickly ravage
the body of the victim, it is best to have this spell pre- memorized
and ready for use whenever you feel the chances of a disease being
caught are high. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Ward Undead</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"> - The Cleric's first step into the ability to
deliver great damage to the undead. Ward Undead, even as a lower
level spell, should not be underestimated. In addition, when mana
is low, or your target is nearly dead, it is good to be able to
fall back onto this spell and not waste the larger amounts of
mana required for the more devastating spell Expulse Undead. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="+1">Rank III<BR>
</FONT></U><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Sense the Dead</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"> - A basic spell for a basic purpose, Sense the
Dead makes is easier for the Cleric on such a quest to locate
his or her potential targets<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" SIZE="+1">Rank IV<BR>
</FONT></U><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Healing</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"> - The pinnacle of a Cleric's training into the
ability to heal others. This spell, while absorbing a tremondous
amount of mana, can nearly completely heal most injured souls.
However, as a battlefield healing spell it should be used with
caution. The use of such a spell will often leave the cleric drained
of important mana that could be used more importantly elsewhere.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Expulse Undead</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"> - The mainstay of a Cleric's fight, Expulse
Undead can do devastating amounts of damage to these creatures.
It should not, however, be over used. With such a large expenditure
of mana required, one should always consider whether or not the
extra firepower is required. Never be ashamed to fall back on
Ward Undead. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1">Invisibility to Undead</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"> - This spell can allow the Cleric to wander
untouched through a sea of undead creatures. This spell is best
used to scout out your potential targets. Then through careful
use of attacks and Spook the Undead you can control the pace of
the battle.</FONT></B></P>
