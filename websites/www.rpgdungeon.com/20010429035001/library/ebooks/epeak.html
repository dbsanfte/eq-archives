<P><B>You are an elf named Landon. You are five feet five inches
tall. Although slender, you are very strong and quick on your
feet. You are 270 years old, since elves live to be about 1200
years old, you are still in your early teens by human terms. Your
hair is a dark chestnut-brown and hangs straightto your shoulders.
Your eyes are emerald green. Like all elves, you have elvensight
allowing you to see objectsin the dark by the heat they give off.
You speak a number of languages, including those of orcs, goblins,
ogres, and halflings as well as the common language of humans.<BR>
<BR>
Although you are young and untried as a warrior, you have trained
long and hard and are skillful with both sword and dagger.<BR>
<BR>
Your adventure begins in the cold, clear dawn of a late autumn
morning in you village of Aralia. Mauric, the Chief Elder of the
village, has asked his people to gather in the Great Hall for
an important meeting.<BR>
<BR>
Speaking in a low, but commanding voice, Mauric addresses his
people, &quot;For three months now, no caravans have reached our
village. Supplies are running very low. Someone or something has
completely cut Aralia off from the Land Beyond the Peaks. We have
sent parties of elven warriors to discover what is wrong but none
have returned. Soon the great snows will come and our village
will perish without supplies. If we are to survive, someone must
open the way to the Land Beyond the Peaks so caravanscan get through.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Council of Elders has met all night in secret session
and decided to choose by lot one elf from the village to try to
open the way to the Land Beyond the Peaks. The Council feels one
elf may succeed where many have not. The name drawn in the lottery
is that of Landon. Though as yet untried as a warrior, the Elders
feel that Landon's goodness of heart and strength of purpse are
more valuable than fighting experience. Landon please step forward.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Ignoring the grumbling from the older warriors, you step forward
and say proudly, &quot;Mauric, I accept this mission. Please know
that I will do my best.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mauric continues, &quot;Landon, for your mission, the Council
will supply you with a mountain mule and a portion of our dwindling
supplies. We are also entrusting you with our greatest treasure,
the fabled Sword of the Magus. This sword has many special Qualities.
It cannot be broken no matter how hard it is struck. At your command,
it will throw a clear, golden light over a ten foot area. The
Sword of the Magus will hum in the presence of enemies. If you
are defeated or slain the Sword will lose its powers. It cannot
be used by anyone who is not pure in heart. Prepare yourself,
Landon, you leave within the hour.<BR>
<BR>
The hour speeds by quickly as you change from your everyday clothes
into a gray suede shirt and pants and a gray hooded cloak lined
with silver fur. You put a tiny bone-handled knife into the secret
pocket inside your shirt. You lace your tall black leather boots
to your knees and begin filling you backpack with supplies. You
load it with an axe, a rope, oil flask, some herbal medicine,
a drinking horn, a tinder box, and torches.<BR>
<BR>
Strapping a silver dagger to your belt and slinging a bow and
a quiver of arrows over your shoulder, you prepare to leave. Following
a narrow, rocky trail, you leave your beloved village behind,
sped on your way by the blessings of family and friends.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually, Aralia becomes lost in the distance. As you climb
out of your valley home, rocky peaks tower above you. Snow covers
most of the peaks, but a few wear crowns of gray, ancient rock.
One peak stands out above the rest. From time out of mind, your
people have called it Everfrost Peaks . . . The Mountains of Mirrors.
Snow covers Everfrost Peaks on all sides and its upper peaks are
shrouded in sheets of solid ice. When the sun shines, the mountains
sparkle like cold, perfect diamonds.<BR>
<BR>
As approach Everfrost, dark clouds blot out the sun and a chill,
piercing wind rises. The path climbs steeply into the roof of
the clouds. Several times, your mule pulls back on its reins,
reluctant to move forward. You sigh in sympathy. If there were
another trail, you would surely take it.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Mule,&quot; you say finally, &quot;sometimes there's no
choice and you have to do things you don't like. Stop fussing
and move!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tucking your head down against the wind, you continue trudgingup
the mountainside pulling the stubborn mule behind you. The afternoon
passes quickly and soon the night. The idea of spending the night
alone on the mountain frightens you, but you have no other choice.
Just ahead, you spot a sheltered hollow off the trail. If you
hurry, you can make your camp while there is still some light.<BR>
<BR>
You reach the hollow just before sunset. You set up your camp
and feed the mule. Then, you set about cooking your own dinner.
After eating, you snuggle down into your warmest furs and prepare
to sleep. You are so tired that your eyes close almost instantly.<BR>
<BR>
A faint cry reaches your ears. Wide awake, you listen but hear
nothing more. You decide it must have been the cry of a nightbird.
Settling down, you try once more to get some sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Again, the cry echoes through the valley . . . louder now. Alert,
you sit up and wait for the next cry. You are sure now that it
was definitely a voice you heard . . . the voice of someone in
trouble. The cries seem to be coming from the trail. Drawing your
sword and slinging your bow and arrows over your shoulder, you
creep quietly down to the trail. You see nothing in the direction
from which you came.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Help! Help!&quot; The sharp but still distant cry comes
from behind you. Whirling around, you see three elves srinting
full speed down the trail pursued by four ogres. The ogres are
nine feet tall with greenish-brown skin, snaggley, yellow teeth
ad sharp black claws. Each carries a pair of spears.<BR>
<BR>
Seeing the elves' danger, you start to wade through the heavy
snow toward the battle.<BR>
<BR>
Close to the edge of exhaustion, the elves stumble more than they
run. As you watch, one elf slips on an icy patch and falls to
the ground, his weapons clattering away. His companions stop,
uncertain, tug his arm and urge him to rise. But he does not move.
The elves glance back at the ogres who are gaining on them. Finally,
they race on, leaving their fallen friend behind.<BR>
<BR>
One of the ogres picks the fallen elf up by one foot. Struggling
weakly, the elf dangles upside down. He pulls out his short sword
and strikes desperately at the monster. The ogre only laughs and
tosses the elf over the cliff that borders the trail. The elf
disappears falling hundreds of feet to the valler floor below.<BR>
<BR>
Still wading through the snow, you glimpse the remaining elves
struggle between themselves. The larger elf is weaponless and
holds the other by both arms. With a sudden wrench, the smaller
elf pulls away and rushes back toward the ogres.<BR>
<BR>
The ogres sand at the edge of the cliff laughing about the elf's
death. They are surprised and unprepared for the attack. Sword
swinging, the elf is upon them before they realize it.<BR>
<BR>
He strikes first at the ogre who killed his friend, breaking his
sword off at the hilt. The dying ogre tries to speak, but crumples
to the ground with the broken blade lodged in its body. The elf
draws his dagger and flings himself at another ogre. He stabs
three times before his new foe can draw its own sword and attack.
The other ogres crowd forward to join the fight but there is room
on the narrow trail for only one of them. The elf stays out of
the range of the wounded ogre's sword and is unable to move close
enough to strike a fatal blow.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, out of nowhere, something slies through the air and
strikes the ogre on the forehead. The weaponless elf has thrown
a snowballto distract the ogre! As he continues to bombard his
enemy, the surprised ogre throws its arms up to protect itself.
While the snowballs cannot harm the ogre, they do confuse it.
The first elf seizes his opportunity, leaps forward and plunges
his dagger into the ogre's stomach. Before the body hits the ground,
the elf turns and races down the trail.<BR>
<BR>
Screams of rage echo through the valley as the two remaining ogres
rush after the elf. The first ogre grabs a spear. Taking careful
aim, it lets the spear fly through the air with deadly accuracy.
<BR>
<BR>
The spear strikes the elf, sending him sprawling onthe icy trail.
He struggles to rise, but cannot.<BR>
<BR>
With a cry of rage, the weaponless elf charges the enemy. The
ogre throws its second spear as it runs.<BR>
<BR>
The injured elf raises his head wearily and sees the spear flying
toward his companion. With a vailiant surge of strength, he flings
himself between them. Both elves fall heavily to the trail. The
weaponless elf struggles to his knees unharmed. But the other
elf lies crumpled in the snow with two spears lodged in his body.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ulmus! Ulmus!&quot; sobs the weaponless elf.<BR>
<BR>
The ogres roar with laughter at his cries. At the sound of their
laughter, the grieving elf leaps to his feet and rushes toward
them. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;So you wnat some of the same, little guy? Keep on coming,
elfie. This spear is for you,&quot; growls one of the ogres waving
a spear.<BR>
<BR>
The ogre's words stop the elf. He stands hesitantly on the trail
with no weapons to defend himself.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What's the matter . . . chicken? I'll come to you,&quot;
roars the ogre starting forward.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Quick, elf! This way,&quot; you yell. You are still too
far away to help him but are getting closer each second. If you
can just reach him, his chances of escape will be better.<BR>
<BR>
The elf hears your words and sprints down the trail toward you.
Both ogres shriek in anger when they spot you. Quickly you ready
your bow and draw an arrow from you quiver. The elf narrows the
gap between you and the ogres are almost within range of your
bow. At this distance a bow and arrow is a better weapon than
a sword. If you can keep the ogres at a distance, both you and
the elf may yet survive this encounter. <BR>
<BR>
Heart pounding, you force yourself to wait until the ogres are
within range. Then carefully, you draw back the bowstring and
let the arrows fly. They leap from your bow in a deadly arc whizzing
through the frigid air toward the ogres.<BR>
<BR>
The first arrow slams into an ogre. It stumbles but continues
to lurch forward. Then zock! Zock! Zock! The remaining arrows
thud into its body. The ogre stops, takes a faltering step, staggers
and falls. <BR>
<BR>
The last ogre kneels by the bloody form of its companion, grabs
a fallen spear and rises.<BR>
<BR>
Before you can get off another volley of arrows, the ogre draws
back the spear and throws it with tremendous force.<BR>
<BR>
Then with one final growl, it turns and races back up the trail.<BR>
<BR>
You hear a low moan of pain. The spear has found its mark! The
elf has been hit. Hurrying up the trail, you kneel at the side
of the wounded elf and examine him. The spear has passed through
his chest just below his right shoulder.<BR>
<BR>
With a shock, your recognize him as Hallic, and elven warrior
from your village, who left with the last party that tried to
cross the mountains.<BR>
<BR>
Hallic tries to speak but no words come. He collapses on the snow.
Frantically, you tear aside his clothing and listen at his chest.
Dimly, you hear a ragged heartbeat; he still lives. Working fast
you cut his shirt away from the wound, and gently remove the spear.
Binding the awful wound with pieces of his shirt, you carry the
elf to your camp.<BR>
<BR>
Gathering what little wood you can find, you build a fire and
wrap the elf in blackets. Then you settle down to keep watch over
Hallic throughout the long night.<BR>
<BR>
Around dawn, Hallic stirs and mumbles, &quot;I killed him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You certainly did. I never saw such a good shot with a snowball,&quot;
you reply.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No , I don't mean the ogre. I mean Ulmus. He was my brother.
I killed him. If he hadn't tried to save me, he'd be alive now.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tears trickle from the corners of Hallic's gray eyes.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He made the choice,&quot; you say in a tear-choked voice.
&quot;You must not dwell on his death. Ulmus would not want you
to grieve so.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Hallic turns his head, closes his eyes and is silent. Tears continue
to trickle down his pale cheeks.<BR>
<BR>
You reach for the horn of herbal medicine simmering at the edge
of the fire. Turning back to Hallic, you see he has lapsed into
unconsciousness.<BR>
<BR>
All day the elf wanders in and out of consciousness, delirious
and feverish. You bathe him with ice stream water, but the fever
does not break. You keep trying to get Hallic to drink some of
the healing herbalbrew, but his restlessness only allows a little
of the liquid to drip down his throat. The wound, the fever, and
his grief over his brother's death are more then he can bear.<BR>
<BR>
At nightfall Hallic awakens, his gray eyes large and clear. His
fever has faded. You reach for the medicine.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No,&quot; says Hallic in a faint voice. &quot;There is no
need. The pain has left me and I shall soon be with my brother.
I can ask for no more.&quot; He fumbles for your hand. You take
it and fell his pulse fluttering like a trapped bird. &quot;Please
tell the Elders we tried but there were just too many of them
for us.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Too many of what?&quot; you ask.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Orcs, goblins, ogres, and even a frost giant,&quot; whispers
Hallic. &quot;I have always knew there was something evil about
the Everfrost Peaks.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Evil? What evil? Please tell me what to expect.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In a dying voice, Hallic gasps, &quot;Ice caves . . . mines .
. . monsters . . . prisoners. Death!!!&quot; His pulse flickers
for a brief moment and then is still. He stares at you with empty
eyes, small smile on his lips.<BR>
<BR>
With a deep sigh of sadness, you prepare to bury Hallic. Throughout
the long night you gather rocks. Slowly, you build a rock tomb.
At daybreak, you lay the last rock with bruised and aching hands.
Hallic is now at peace . . . and you must go on.<BR>
<BR>
You have difficulty forcing the mule around the frozen body of
the ogre. With a bray of protest, it finall leaps forward. Prancing
wildly, it dashes up the trail ahead of you. You run to catch
it.<BR>
<BR>
The mule has already rounded the boulder ahead of you. Sddenly
it gives a terrified bray. &quot;Stupid mule. Trust it to make
a noise like that when we need to be quiet,&quot; you mutter to
yourself.<BR>
<BR>
You round the boulder and all thoughts of silence leave your mind.
You want to cry out in terror yourself. Directly ahead of you,
the trail doubles back on itself like a giant C. You stand on
one side of the trail next to the braying mule. On your left is
the mountain wall. On your right . . . empty air.<BR>
<BR>
Forty feet across the chasm is the other side of the trail. Carved
into the mountain wall is a cave with the opening framed in ice
and snow and sitting at the opening of the cave is an enormous
frost giant and a young white dragon.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Look, Fang!&quot; booms the frost giant, his icy blue skin
glinting in the sunlight. &quot;We've got company. Come on, where
are your manners? Greet our guests!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Fang, the white dragon, draws its scaly lips back over long sharp
teeth and almost seems to smile. Then, it opens its mouth and
belches a cone o white frost that rolls across the chasm. The
frost falls far short of you.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If I've told you once, I've told you a hundred times, you
have to practice! You missed an easy shot. Try again!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The giant seems to think you and the mule are nothing but toys
for Fang's target practice. That makes you angry.<BR>
<BR>
While the giant continues to lecture the dragon, you grab your
bow and three of your remaining arrows and take aim. Zap! Zap!
Zap! The arrows fly across the chasm and bounce off the giant's
armor. Even though your shots were well-placed, they have no effect.<BR>
<BR>
Surprisingly, the giant laughs again. &quot;You can't hurt us.
You and Fang would make a good team, Dumb and Dumber.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The dragon rumbles and roars.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Don't like arrows, Fang? Well, blast them again. You're
fifty years old. You should be doing better. At the rate you're
going you'll be 100 before you amount to a hill of snowballs.
Now, take careful aim and blast!&quot; cautions the giant.<BR>
<BR>
You grab another arrow. Drawing the bow, you aim and let the arrow
fly at the dragon.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yirk!&quot; screeches Fang as the arrow strikes its rump.
It roolls over on its back digging the arrow deeper into its flesh
and making the pain worse. &quot;Yip! Yip! Yip!&quot; it shrills
again.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Don't just lay there screaming,&quot; says the giant. &quot;Do
something. Are you going to let an elf do that to you?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As if in answer, Fang blasts forth a great frost cone with a huge
roar of anger and pain. Unforunately, the frost cone strikes the
snow and ice hanging above the cave. The roar echoes and bounces
off the narrow walled trail where you and the mule stand.<BR>
<BR>
As the echoes of the roar fade, you hear another noise. Softly,
at firest merely a murmur, it grows louder and louder. Soon i
sounds like a thousand dragons roaring. Both you and the giant
look upward to see an incredible sight. It looks like the entire
mountain is falling! An Avalanche! Powdery snow, followed by huge
chunks of ice are tumbling straight down the side of the mountain
toward you.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Fang, you stupid idiot! Look what you've done!&quot; bellows
the giant. &quot;You set off an avalanche! Get off your scaly
bottom and stop screeching. Quick! Get back in the tunnel!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Fang and the giant are luckier than you. They have shelter. Nothing
stands between you and the thundering wall of snow.<BR>
<BR>
You press close to the side of the mountain. Grabbing the mule's
reins, you back up the trail the way oyou came. The mule is quick
to follow, almost running over you in its eagerness to escape.
You race around the corner just as tons of snow, ice, and rocks
crash down behind you on the trail. The thundering, rumbling,
and roaring go on for long minutes. The mountain and trail beneath
your feet tremble. When the awful noise finally stops, you look
around. The trail is gone . . . the cave is gone . . . buried
deep beneath a mass of ice and snow. The chasm between the two
trails is now filled with snow.<BR>
<BR>
If you are to continue, you must dig out the snow-filled trail.
It will be difficult and dangerous. One false step and you could
plunge from the mountainside to your death.<BR>
