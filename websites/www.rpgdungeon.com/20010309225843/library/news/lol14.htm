<UL>
  <OL>
    <LI>Set up you onelist account to receive digest instead of every
    email, it is slower but you only get one or two a day.

    to a separate folder.
    <LI>Sign up for a free email account with someone like yahoo
    or hotmail and use that address for the list.
    <LI>When replying to a post only repeat the part of the original
    message that pertains to what you are saying
    <LI>This is a message board about Bards, you may say whatever
    you wish and posting about a guild or person is a good way to
    let others of our profession know about something ahead of time.
    <LI>No, I will not ban someone from the list unless they are
    being totally uncouth.
  </OL>

</FONT>Plate or not to Plate</U></B><I>: by Dean Kimes</I></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Kit sat back, enjoying another bottle of fine elven wine. If
only he could get that pretty red-haired serving girl to join
him things would be even better. He flashed her a smile as she
passed, just to let her know he was ready for another drink. As
he waited for her to return he turned his gaze to the pair of
adventurers playing King's court over by the wall. A tall burly
type all decked out in plate and his stylish friend with a drum
by his chair. A fellow bard he wondered to himself? He noticed
that the warrior type was drinking rather heavily, and sweating
nearly as much. Kit watched amusedly as the burly one removed
his armor piece by piece. If I made a lass wait that long in the
evenings, her ardor would surely cool. Still, perhaps it might
have its uses, 'twas surely flashy enough. Then to his amazement,
while the warrior answered the call of Tunare, the other bard
decided to try on the plate for himself! As Kit watched the other
bard put on the Great steel helmet, hmmm that would make it difficult
to see my rakish good looks, not to mention ruining those windswept
locks. Still it would deflect a gnoll's mace well... The breastplate,
keep one from getting poked by a spear perhaps, but what's the
point of having a flawless chest and tight abs if the ladies can't
see them... The gauntlets??? Right out he thought to himself,
playing a mandolin is tricky enough in snakeskin, the cost in
strings alone would make those gauntlets seem cheap by comparison.
Boots??? Well I suppose it would make you less likely to be trod
upon by clumsy barbarians coming off the ship, but how would he
sneak deep into the lair of the Splitpaw clanhold with those things
on, for that matter with any of it on. Kit sighed as the other
bard seemed enamored with the feel and weight of the newfound
protection. Yes he thought, it would well keep you from sword
and claw, but so would guile and magery. Perhaps that might suit
him thought Kit as he led the pretty red-haired lass upstairs,
twirling a key around his finger; but give me the freedom to move
and I'll be happy to let the brutes keep their plate. I have better
armor he laughed, my rapier wit, keen intellect, and rakish good
looks. True the Splitpaw don't appreciate them, but then again
only Ren Rexx ever saw them, and he only briefly...</P>

<P><B><U>Rivervale: Bard's Tale, indeed:</U> </B><I>The Questor's
Inn and Gilgadet</I></P>

<P>It has been quite some time since I have put anything down
on paper. The reasoning for this is simple: I have been hard at
work for the guild.</P>

<P>It seems that, although there is more than enough to kill,
Qeynos Hills was not challenging enough for me anymore. I brought
this up to my guildmaster, and thus: I was sent on a mission to
RiverVale.</P>

<P>Part of the challenge of attaining the Ninth Circle, he says,
is getting to a far away city alive, and being rebound, so the
soul will travel there upon the minor nap. It was at this time
that I decided to call upon an old friend: Levarne.</P>

<P>It was perhaps two years ago that I met Levarne. Oddly enough
it had been in the city of Qeynos, and not, like most adventurers
you meet, on the field of battle. I was sitting near the pond
by Crows thinking about fishing, when I heard a scratchy voice
attempt to sing. I quickly looked around and saw very little of
interest.</P>

<P>Indeed, he was perhaps five foot four, and was very frail--even
more brittle than I, and wizards are not known for their stature.
And, while I was not impressed with the mans voice, what he said
was intriguing.</P>

<P>&quot;Burning pain, red and slashing, I wash you away with
song and dancing...&quot; I cannot remember the next verse, however
it was not long before his hands began to glow, and he was surrounded
by a shimmering blue aura.</P>

<P>Shocked, I decided to speak with him so I shouted over his
voice, &quot;Hail!&quot;</P>

<P>A look of slight irritation formed on his face as he stopped
singing. &quot;Ahhh. You have spoiled my song, friend,&quot; he
said, placing his loot on the ground, so he could extend his hand
to me. &quot;Well met, my name is Levarne.&quot;</P>

<P>I grasped his forearm and said, &quot;Well met. That was a
lovely song you were singing, though. Where did you learn it?&quot;</P>

<P>Levarne chuckled, &quot;From some very interesting people...Unfortunately,
I have had a sore throat, and I was trying to cure it. I can't
get the note out the way that I need to.&quot;</P>

<P>And so, we went into Crows for a drink to soothe the bards
throat, and to speak of the current events in greater Qeynos.
We had a good time together that night, and spent several subsequent
nights in the Plains of Karana hunting giant spiders, although
I can not remember any extraordinary tales of these times.</P>

<P>After one particular night, the last one in fact, for reasons
which are going to become apparent to you in a moment, I would
not see him again. After killing a particularly nasty spider,
he said, &quot;Friend, I have enjoyed traveling with you, but
the time for me to depart is at hand.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why do you want to go? The gold is good, and the times
are great...&quot;</P>

<P>Levarne just shook his head, and said, &quot;Unfortunately,
you can not understand. It's time for me to go. Farewell, and
good luck.&quot;</P>

<P>I watched as he walked in the direction of North Karana, thinking
of all the great times we shared.</P>

<P>Ahh. I digress. My guild wanted me to travel to RiverVale,
which was a somewhat daunting task, since I did not know how to
get there, and I knew that the northern plains of Karana was a
very rough place. I was contemplating different ways of getting
there as I walked by Crows, and I heard a strong, smooth voice
sing, &quot;Fist of fright has given me the power to be a man
of might&quot;. I looked and saw a rather strong wood elf singing
with dull yellow balls of light flowing around him.</P>

<P>Upon closer inspection, I realized that this was in fact my
old friend, Levarne! It seemed that Karana was looking upon me
in a favorable light. The trip to Rivervale would be simple now,
for I heard that bards posses a song that will make you run faster
than the wind blows and not even a giant could keep up!</P>

<P>&quot;Levarne! Hail once again!&quot; I shouted above his voice.</P>

<P>He stopped his song, and looked a bit perturbed. &quot;You
have interrupted m-&quot; He paused for a moment. &quot;Gilgadet.
It has been a long time.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Aye, friend. Two years it has been. Much has changed.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, I see that you have grown a beard. Looks nice. How
are your studies coming?&quot;</P>

<P>I smiled as he just led me right where I wanted this conversation
to go. &quot;My studies are at a standstill, until I get to a
place called the Misty Thicket in Rivervale. My guildmaster says
the city is under attack by orcs and goblins, and that another
wizard would be a big help.&quot;</P>

<P>He looked at me with sad eyes. &quot;Aye, the city is under
constant attack on both sides of the city. Luckily, it is protected
by the Deputy Guard, and the city is in a valley between mountains
that makes it easily defensible. But the Goblins are winning on
sheer numbers alone.&quot;</P>

<P>He paused for another moment. &quot;How do you plan on getting
through the gorge?&quot;</P>

<P>I gave him a blank stare, which, although blank, seemed to
provide him with ample information to make a deduction. &quot;You
don't know what the gorge is, do you?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot; I don't have time to study geography, Levarne! It takes
time to learn how to freeze your opponent with but a few thoughts!&quot;</P>

<P>Levarne sighed. &quot;Aye. I suppose, I will escort you to
the Gorge. I have friends who will help get us through. You need
me, if your guild is going to make a habit of sending its people
to dangerous lands, without informing them of the details. It
is a much more dangerous place than North Karana....&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;More dangerous that that?! I have a hard time believing
it.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You will see soon enough, Gilgadet. 'Tis dangerous. OK.
Although I would like to spin tales with you all evening, we need
to get ready to leave. Tomorrow night, we meet at the second tower
in the Western Plains of Karana. Around 1am, so it is light when
we get to the gorge.&quot;</P>

<P>I spent the next part of the day preparing for the trip. Afterwards,
I went to the Inn, and as I entered, Gatha spoke, &quot;Gilgadet,
Aldarin left you another letter!&quot;</P>

<P>I happily tore into it, &quot;Hail, friend! I have just decided
to try my luck on the content of Faydwer. It seems that they have
some problems that need to be dealt with. I would like you to
come, as well. You need a fresh view on Norrath, and some travel
would do you well. If you want to come, meet me at the docks in
the morning. The boat leaves at nine.&quot;</P>

<P>Sadly, I had no way to relay the message to him that I was
on a guild quest to Rivervale, so he would just have to travel
alone. I silently prayed to Karana to let the power of the storms
be with him.</P>

<P>&quot;Gatha, I am going away.&quot;</P>

<P>She looked at me, quite surprised. &quot;To another inn? What
have I done to you!&quot;</P>

<P>I chuckled, remembering how often Gatha bent over backwards
to help me. &quot;Nay, I have been sent on a Guild quest this
day. I am leaving for Rivervale tonight.&quot;</P>

<P>She looked at me somberly. &quot;I have heard drunk adventurers
spinning tales of dangerous places between here and Rivervale.
You have a message sent to me as soon as you get there, so I know
your OK.&quot;</P>

<P>Although I would miss her, I knew that I needed a change of
scenery. I was having a hard time believing the fact that there
were more powerful creatures than hill giants, and that the world
expanded much farther than the Western Plains. Aye, for being
a learned man, it seemed I had much to learn.</P>

<P>Time passed slowly for us, as we ran across the plains that
night. And, aye, it was true what they said about the bard song
of running. Sometimes, it seemed we were gliding across the ground,
rather than running on it. The trip was uneventful across them,
except for the Griffin.</P>

<P>I saw the beast from a distance, and it coolly flew toward
me. I felt a fright well up inside like no other as I knew my
feeble spells would do nothing to it. Levarne told me to keep
running, and relax, even as it's claws raked my back.</P>

<P>&quot;Agrahhahaa&quot; I yelled in pain. But my feet kept moving,
and soon we left the feared beast behind. We traveled over several
dead bodies, no doubt a result of confronting the Griffin.</P>

<P>At last, we reached the place known as the Gorge. It was was
a narrow valley between two mountains. Although I did not see
any creatures here, I could see why the place was so feared. If
something attacked, there would be no place to run and hide, like
in the plains.</P>

<P>&quot;Levarne....What is our plan now?&quot; I asked, genuinely
concerned.</P>

<P>He was silent, and raised a hand to hush me. Then, I heard
it. A soft scruffling sound behind me. I spun on my heels to see
the source of the sound, but, alas, there was nothing there.</P>

<P>The silence was dreadful. Aye, even the wind blowing and whistling
in the gorge had stopped. Then, a hushed but familiar voice said,
&quot;Levarne! Glad to see you made it this far.&quot;</P>

<P>I turned to the source of the voice, but saw nothing. Levarne
stood from his hiding spot, and began a conversation with the
voice. I knew that I had heard it before, but I could not place
it.</P>

<P>&quot;Aye, friend. It was an easy journey, except for the Griffin
that attacked Gilgadet.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Gilgadet! Is it really you?&quot; the invisible voice
said.</P>

<P>I was much suspicious, although I had seen such powers before.
&quot;Aye. And who might you be?&quot;</P>

<P>Suddenly from where nothing but a voice was heard, a halfling
appeared. Muley!</P>

<P>I was overcome by joy in seeing him again, for it had been
a long time.</P>

<P>&quot;It is good to see you, lad! I like the beard,&quot;he
said, stroking his own.</P>

<P>&quot;My thanks. How have you been? It's been what, three years
or so?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Aye. Three years, and it's been going well. I have been
delivering skins to Duca.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Ahhh! Duca! I haven't seen him around in many months.
He is doing well?&quot; I asked stroking the giant snake fang
he gave me.</P>

<P>Muley said, &quot;Aye he is doing well, however he doesn't
get out as much as he used to. He is trying to open an armor shop
in Freeport, but it is slow going.&quot;</P>

<P>Levarne cleared his throat. &quot;I would like to stand here
in this evil gorge and talk with you about all this, but we need
to go. Halflings are dying this very moment in RiverVale, and
if we stand here much longer, we are next.&quot;</P>

<P>Muley turned to him and said, &quot;Ye gads, lad. For a bard
you sure are impatient.&quot; &quot;The Gorge is a mightily evil
place, Gilgadet. I will cast invisibility on you, but it won't
last long. Do not attempt to look at the sights, or you are a
dead man. Stay to the left, and on the main path, and look for
a cave entrance. Enter the cave, and wait for me there.&quot;</P>

<P>He wasted no time as he cast the spell upon me. &quot;Run,
lad, Run!&quot;</P>

<P>I began to run through the Gorge, fully expecting to see some
really big spiders, and perhaps a Cyclops or Hill Giant. What
I saw almost stopped me in my tracks, for I had never seen such
atrocities before.</P>

<P>A giant eye was floating about eight feet off the ground. It
had a leathery look, as opposed to a slimy one, and it smelled
of rotten potatoes. It seemed to be looking right at me. Heeding
Muley's advice I silently ran passed it, and stuck to the left
of the path.</P>

<P>I saw eye after eye, and they terrified me. Aye, I am still
having nightmares of these beasts, and, when I gain the power
necessary, I will come back and destroy some of these creatures.
I vowed to myself to find the creator of these atrocities and
give him a stern talking to.</P>

<P>After a long run, I looked down and saw my robe shimmering.
Oh no! The spell is wearing off!</P>

<P>I giant eye loomed in the distance behind me, and slowly turned.
I knew I was dead if I didn't run right then.</P>

<P>I began running, turning my head every so often to see how
far behind it was. Flashes of fire erupted around me, as it was
casting its spells on the fly. A rock beside me exploded, and
I was minorly hurt by fragments of rock, and I fell to the ground
in a heap. I turned and saw the eye coming for me, and I knew
I was a dead man.</P>

<P>Suddenly, something invisible grabbed my robe, and thrust me
on my feet. Levarne! He too, became visible, and I thought we
were both dead men. But as we continued to run, he began beating
a drum.</P>

<P>Now, I'll be the first to admit that the most irritating thing
about bards is that they sing at the most inopportune times, but
this time it was welcome. The comfortable flashing blue light
surrounded us and we quickly ran away from the beast. It was not
long before we found the cave, dubbed Runnyeye.</P>

<P>Muley met us just inside the entrance, &quot;I thought ye lads
were history. Good thinking, Levarne.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Aye. You need to practice your spells a bit more, druid.
That almost cost us.&quot;</P>

<P>Muley mumbled something about how Levarne could function, being
so irritable all the time, then turned to me and said, &quot;It
was nice to see you Gilgadet, but I must go back to the Gorge,
and escort others through.&quot;</P>

<P>Levarne threw him a platinum piece. &quot;My thanks again,
friend.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Anytime, lad.&quot;</P>

<P>Levarne turned to me and said, &quot;We must rest here for
a moment, and make sure the way is clear. These caves are dangerous.
Do not fight anything, and do not fall in the water around the
corner.&quot;</P>

<P>We went through a few moments of silence, and I reflected on
the evil eyes in the gorge. I don't know how I would have made
it without Levarne.</P>

<P>&quot;How did you know Muley?&quot; he asked me.</P>

<P>&quot;I met him in Qeynos Hills just after I was accepted by
the Guild. Chrom and I...&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You know Chrom? Tis a small world,&quot; Levarne said.
&quot;That Chrom is quite a character.&quot;</P>

<P>I laughed, &quot;Aye. Tis a most crafty fellow. I once saw
him sneak into the lady chamber in Cr-&quot;</P>

<P>I was cut short by Levarne's raised hand. He tilted his head,
and listened. &quot;We must go. I hear a shaman chanting in the
distance. Just keep up with me, and say nothing.&quot;</P>

<P>We ran a short distance, never seeing any monsters, and we
made it to the mouth of the cave. It was here, however, that I
saw two goblin guards.</P>

<P>The creatures were green skinned and hairy, with big teeth,
and small heads. They looked no more fearsome than gray wolves
to me, but Levarne whispered, &quot;They are a little tougher
than they look, and they will overpower you with numbers. When
I say go, run strait out of this cave, until you come to a wall,
turn left and run until you come to a gate.</P>

<P>When he said the word, I ran as fast as I could between the
guards. They both attacked me, but missed. It was a short distance
to the wall, where I turned left and ran some more. Two small
halflings that I would later learn were Deputies, screamed warnings
to the goblins, and slew them with but a few slashes of their
fine blades.</P>

<P>I sat just inside the gate, and wondered where Levarne had
gone. It was mighty warm for the time of year here, and everything
was covered in a fine mist. Although it was daylight, the tree
cover was so thick, and the air so heavy, everything was cast
in shades of green. It was very pretty, and I began to realize
just how big Norrath was, and how much I had been missing while
studying in Qeynos for so long.</P>

<P>&quot;Are you ready? We must go to town.&quot; Levarne said</P>

<P>And so it came to pass that I made it to RiverVale. I have
since joined the Deputy Guard and have been helping stop the onslaught
of Goblins, although it seems the situation is dire, indeed. Levarne
and I have grown quite close, and realized that although our past
is different, our future seems to be one and the same.</P>

<P>I received a letter from the Guild yesterday stating that they
are very proud of me, and have given me access to the eleventh
circle. I am proud of my accomplishments, but realize that without
the help of friends, it would have been unattainable. Aye, friends
are the most important thing in life. I would give my life for
the safety of them all.</P>

<P><STRONG>Experience Penalty - Petition's Stand: TOO HIGH</STRONG></P>

<P>Bards have a severe experience penalty. Part of the penalty
comes from being a hybrid class, which good sources state is a
25% penalty. If you are a Wood Elf or Half Elf, this penalty is
added on due to race penalties. Some sources have also stated
that Bards receive a penalty when soloing. Whether this is true
or not, I cannot confirm, but soloing is so difficult for a bard
that it seems like it. At any rate, even when grouped with other
hybrids at my level I notice that I don't get as much exp. <STRONG>This
petition's stance is that the Experience Penalty for Bards needs
to be modified to be lower than it currently is, regardless of
which of the above methods are responsible.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Pet Resistance - Petition's Stand: Pet Resistance is
a Bug that Needs to be Fixed</STRONG></P>

<P>Pets currently resist all of a Bard's songs. I'm sure this
was put in to avoid accidentally attacking a pet when a PvP's
pet and a PvP Bard were near each other. However, it totally messes
up things for -PvP players. Not only do pets not receive a Bard's
Buffs, they most importantly don't get Selo's Accelerando, nor
to my knowledge, Invisibility sung by a Bard. This makes it very
irritating and many times useless for Bards and Pet-owners to
group up, which is counterintuitive to Everquests grouping goal,
and unfair to the group for the pet to not benefit from the Bard's
songs. <STRONG>With -PvP players, Pets should be treated just
like players with respect to a Bard's Songs. Period.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Bard-Made Instruments - Petition's Stand: Include in
the Game</STRONG></P>

<P>I have heard that at one point during beta, there were bard-made
instruments. This should be added to the game. There are very
few instruments for a bard to choose from, with no varied effects
(only one type of drum, etc.). If there is a difference between
the Mandolin and the Lute other than weight, I have never seen
it. Bard-made instruments would allow for more types of instruments,
a way for Bards to make money, and varied effects of instruments
on songs. <STRONG>Bard-made instruments should be a part of EverQuest
to allow variety of effect, look, weight, and choice of instruments.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Stronger Rare Instruments - Petition's Stand: Include
in the Game</STRONG></P>

<P>Magical instruments should be available as loot off of certain
creatures, as lore items that increase the effect of the instrument
whose category they fall in to. An example would be something
such as a Fairy Harp which acts as a stringed instrument but with
a 50% increase to the effectiveness over a normal stringed instrument.
By varying the percent increase or other effects, the rarity would
be altered too. One of the easier ones to get could be about the
same difficulty to obtain as say, a Small Brass Sheild, and get
harder and more powerful from there. I have heard a rumor or two
that one or two of these type of instruments exists, but they
are either not strong enough to mess with, or too rare as you
never see Bards talking about these. <STRONG>Stronger, rare Lore
Item instruments should be in the game for Bards to seek out,
increasing the potency of their songs.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Bard Specific Weapons - Petition's Stand: Include in
the Game</STRONG></P>

<P>Bard specific weapons would be a great asset to the Bard class,
and would help to balance them further, especially should they
choose to solo. A Bard specific weapon could be a magical weapon
with non-spectacular melee attributes, but would perform either
partially or entirely as an instrument. For instance: Singing
Sword, X dmg, Xdly, acts as if Stringed Instrument were equipped.
These would obviously be lore items, but have varied strength
of these weapons so that Bards around the mid-teen levels could
start seeking out such a weapon. <STRONG>Bard specific weapons
that have non-exaggerated melee benefit, but effectiveness of
having an instrument equipped should be available.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Annoyance of Non-Pulsing Song Messages - Petition's
Stand: Fewer Messages on Non-Pulsing Songs</STRONG></P>

<P>Currently, all songs give you a text message when the animation
plays through. This is great for pulsing songs, as each message
indicates something has happened. However, continued effect songs
don't need this. Your feet move faster. Your feet move faster.
Your feet move faster. Your feet move faster. Your feet move faster.
Your feet move faster. Your feet move faster. Why not just a message
when it starts and another when it stops? The icon of effect does
a good enough job of letting you know that something is working.
<STRONG>Only Pulse-based songs should give you text messages each
time they fire off. Non-pulse songs should just give one message
when they start, and one message if the effect stops.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Bard Binding - Petition's Stand: Allow Bards to Bind
Themselves</STRONG></P>

<P>Bards are one of the only classes that need to serious travelling
at early levels to get their skills (lvl 8 for most bards to go
cross-continent in search of their songs.) Also, Bards are a class
that is supposedly known for travelling, both historically and
in lore, so it would only make sense that a Bard would deserve
this extra security. In fairness of the other classes that bind,
Bards should probably be limited to binding themselves, although
most people don't charge for binds anymore anyway. <STRONG>Bards
should be able to, at a fairly early level (8-15) gain a song
that allows them to bind themselves.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Language Effect on Songs - Petition's Stand: Language
Skill Factors in to Song Effect</STRONG></P>

<P>Currently the skill that a player has in a language has no
effect on any of the interaction with anything of that language.
Bard songs' effectiveness could be altered based on the Bard's
skill in the language of the target. If he is adept in that language,
resist goes down and the song has a stronger effect. Keep in mind
that an inclusion like this would almost ensure that that would
also mean that if you weren't skilled in that language, that the
chance of resisting would go up, and the song would be made weaker.
<STRONG>Language Skills should factor in to chance to resist and
strength of the songs.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Traveling Bard Experience - Petition's Stand: Quests
of Travel to Gain Experience for Bards</STRONG></P>

<P>As previously mentioned, Bards are wanderers, travelers. Quests
should be available in every city involving traveling and speaking
with a wandering bard. The wandering bards would be scattered
throughout the various zones, and the experience that the quests
give should vary based on the difficulty of the zone that the
wandering bard is in and the distance from the Bard Questgiver.
As there are next to no Bard Quests, and this fits with the concept
of Bards, it would benefit the game and give Bards a variety of
things to do. The quests would need to only be done once each,
but have great benefit (more so than current available Bard quests
by far.) <STRONG>Traveling Bard quests should exist to supplement
the constant travel that Bards do, giving useful quests to a class
that has almost none. It should benefit enough to warrant travelling
the distance and to the zones, giving experience relative to the
distance and danger of those zones.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Problems with Songs</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>FIXED***Level 30 Song - Fufil's Curtailing Chant</STRONG>
-- Regardless of location of target, you get the message &quot;Your
target is out of range.&quot; <STRONG>Please fix.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Level 19 Song - Shauri's Sonorous Clouding</STRONG>
-- Two things: first of all, there should be no &quot;song effect&quot;
sprites, as it gives away that a Bard is invisible (perhaps its
more than monsters the Bard would like to be invisible to...other
casters have this ability.) Secondly, to counter the factor that
group members need a way to see each other, members would see
invisible members of the party, but altered, perhaps transparent,
or with the word [Invisible] by their name so members could follow
each other, and the bard would be able to see quickly who was
getting the effect of his song or not. Of course, to everyone
else, they would be either fully, truly invisible (no song effect)
or in full view if they lose the effect. And contrary to many's
belief, the game doesn't allow you to twist this song with the
See Invisible Song. <STRONG>This song should not provide any graphical
indication, thereby giving away the bard and his party, and a
method should be enabled to allow the group members to see each
other in some way.</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>Various Songs Drawing Monsters </STRONG>-- Songs can
sometimes draw monsters toward a bard even though the monster
is <EM>way</EM> off and never had line of sight with the bard,
and seems to be related to the change that was made recently with
the &quot;distress call/calling for help&quot; that Verant made
a few weeks ago. <STRONG>Monsters that are beyond walls of a dungeon
should not respond to non-area effect songs in such an aggressive
manner.</STRONG></P>
