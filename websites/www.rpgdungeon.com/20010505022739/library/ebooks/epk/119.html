<P><B>You look around at the tons of snow and ice. The way ahead
will be difficult. If you turn back, you will probablylose the
last chance your village has for survival. Already flakes of the
first winter storm are swirling in the cold air.<BR>
<BR>
You make your decision quickly. You will not turn back. You have
given you word to do your best and you will succeed or die trying.<BR>
<BR>
Tying the mule to a huge hynk of ice, you set to work. Afterward
you can't remember how long it took to clear the trail. Your memory
is clouded by the pain of bleeding hands, frozen fingers and snow
blind eyes. But at last the job is done . . . the trail is clear.<BR>
<BR>
You collapse against the shaggy warmth of the mule and fall into
an exhausted sleep. At last, you awaken stiff and sching. Rising
painfully to your feet, you pull the sleepy, snow-covered mule
out onto the narrow trail. It twitches and trembles but follows
you nervously along the icy path.<BR>
<BR>
The path is narrow and dangerous. The mountain rises steeply on
one side covered in snow and ice. On the other side is the sheer
edge of the mountain. At its base, thousands of feet below, are
sharp teeth of rock loosely buried in masses of snow and ice brought
down by the avalanche.<BR>
<BR>
You edge your way past the snow-covered frost giant's cave. Catching
the scent of the dragon, your mule's nostrils flare.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Easy, boy. I dont like it either. Don't worry, the dragon
can't get us now.&quot; The mule flattens its ears against its
head, but continues to plod through the snow past the cave.<BR>
<BR>
The wind increases. Ice and snow blow against you with tremendous
force making it difficult to see and to keep your balance. It
is almost impossible to push forward.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, the mule rears and begins to scream, jerking hard against
the rope. You slip on the icy trail and can no longer control
the frightened mule. Screaming wildly, the mule rips the rope
from your hands, turns and rushes into the storm. Within seconds,
it is lost from sight in the blowing snow. You are alone on the
mountain.<BR>
<BR>
You place your hand on the hilt of the Sword of the Magus. As
though in answer to your touch, the sword begins to hum. You wonder
where the danger could from in this lonely place. <BR>
<BR>
You draw your sword and peer into the driving storm trying to
find your enemy. A figure stumbles toward you out of the whiteness.
It's an orc. It's greenish-brownskin is covered with snow. You
wonder why it is wandering around outside. Orcs hate the light
and usually live underground. You don't have long to wonder. .
. The orc is attacking!!!<BR>
<BR>
There is a sudden lull in the storm, and a bright ray of sun floods
the area. Sensing the brilliance of the sun, the orc turns and
runs. It rushes down the trail with you following close behind.
As you round a bend in the trail, the orc disappears. The snowy
trail stretches before you but no footprints mark its surface.<BR>
<BR>
You wonder if possibly orcs have been ambushing the parties who
travel through these lonely mountain passes. You know that an
orc would be here only for evil purposes.</B></P>

<P><B>Great gusts of snow and freezing wind wail past you on the
narrow ledge tearing the questions about the orc from your mind.
You must soon find shelter or perish.<BR>
<BR>
Closely examining the frozen ground, you see orc footprints leading
straight into the side of the mountain. Looking carefully, you
discover an opening hidden by overhanging ledges of snow and icicles.
Squeezing between two sheets of ice, you enter an ice cave, sword
at the ready for the orc. The Sword fo the Magus is silent. Looking
down, you see many footprints in the frozen ground. There are
footprints you don't recognize.<BR>
<BR>
You creep slowly into the dark cave. You elvensight shows you
that nothing is in the cave. Slowly you step out of the darkenedarea.
Your feet fly out from under you. You come down hard landing flat
on your back. When you land, you begin to slide. This was no small
patch of ice. You travel faster and faster, plunging through a
tunnel of ice sloping downward.<BR>
<BR>
The walls blur. Slowly, the steep angle of the icy shute begins
to even out. Using your feet to brake yourself, you start to slow
down. Finally, you skid to a stop, scared and shaken but unhurt.<BR>
<BR>
The Sword of the Magus remains silent. Whenever you are, there
are no enemies nearby. Holding the Sword of the Magus before you,
you command it, &quot;Great Sword of the Magus, light this place.&quot;
A clear golden light springs from the sword and fills the area.<BR>
<BR>
You are in a small room made of ice. Behind you, the ice chute
rises in shimmering spirals toward the roof far above. You see
nothing in the room but the orc footprints leading to a curious
door on the far wall. You approach the door slowly, holding the
Sword of the Magus before you. <BR>
<BR>
You have never seen a door like this before. It is made from ice
and sculpted on it is a great face. Frosty eyebrows jut over deepset
closed eyes. An enormous beak-like nose extends over a bushy ice
mustache that bristles with tiny icicles. The mouth is frozen
in a frightening snarl.<BR>
<BR>
Stepping up to the door, you push at it with all your strength.
It does not move. You back up, rush toward the door, and crash
into it with your shoulder. Your arm tingles with pain, but the
door hasn't budged.<BR>
<BR>
If you cannot break the door down by force, maybe you can chop
your way through it with your axe. You take the axe and bash the
door a great blow. <BR>
<BR>
The The axe slides in as easily as slicing warm butter but instead
of cutting through the door, the door seals around the blade.
With difficulty, you pull it free from the ice. This is no ordinary
door. It must be enchanted. Still if the orc got though the door,
then so can you.<BR>
<BR>
You walk up to the door, raise your hand and knock on its great
domed forehead. The sound echoes in the small room.<BR>
<BR>
The door's eyes fly open and glare straight at you. The mouth
opens and with a breath like th north wind, it asks, &quot;Who's
there?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A talking door! You stare at it in amazement.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, you went 'knock knock' and I said 'Who's there?'&quot;
says the door. &quot;The least you can do is answer my question.
Why are you staring at me? Don't you know it's not polite to stare?&quot;
snorts the door. &quot;One meets the worst class of beings down
here. Well, I won't waste my time on a dolt who doesn't even know
its own name.&quot; The eyes blink shut and the door is silent
once more.<BR>
<BR>
Your mouth hanging open in amazement, you stare at the door. Your
hands hang limply at your sides. Yo are too astonished to speak.
This door is the strangest thing you've ever encountered. If you
want answers, you must talk to the door.<BR>
<BR>
Stepping forward boldly, you knock again on the frosty forehead.<BR>
<BR>
The door opens its eyes and asks again, &quot;Who's there?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This time you have an answer ready, &quot;An elf,&quot; you reply.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;An elf, who?&quot; asks the door.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Elf Landon, from the village of Aralia. Please let me pass,
Mr. Door.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The door seems pleased with your answer and says, &quot;That's
better. At least you know who you are this time. I'm afraid I
can't let you pass. You see it's my job to guard against intuders
like you. This is an important place and I have a very important
post. I say you can't pass. So go away!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Door,&quot; you say, &quot;I intend to pass, one way or
the other.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just try it!&quot; says the door.<BR>
