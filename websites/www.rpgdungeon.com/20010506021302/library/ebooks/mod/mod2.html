&quot;Idiot,&quot; Lyon muttered again, his hard gray eyes following
Rowan's back, and the look on his face showed that he would like
to decorate it with an arrow.</P>

<P>But shortly his anger fled and he found his way next to a bush,
waiting for Quint and the others to return. As he waited, he found
himself reminiscing upon Rowan and their earlier friendship. They
had met one day when Lyon was a Lieutenant in the Royal Guard
under Rowan's father, Manoel. Preston, although no Master of the
Dagger, Sword, or Arrow, had been Captain. Every member of the
Royal Guard knew why Preston was in such a position -- he was
the son of the King and the royal family could do anything they
pleased, and no one could say anything about it. Lyon, who should
have been Captain, never forgave Preston his heritage. At that
time, Lucian, Manoel's eldest son had been heir, only to die of
fever the next year, making Preston heir. Lyon had gotten out
of the guard, walked across the mountains, and decided to become
Master of Arms at the Lyceum. Rowan and he had gotten along from
the beginning, their hatred for Preston had only bound them together.
While Rowan lusted for the throne, Lyon awaited the day when he
would watch Preston's downfall, for Preston to learn that while
he should hold something, someone else had stolen it. That day,
Lyon decided, was near.</P>

<P>Taking a deep breath, he inhaled the smell of charred flesh,
and though he grimaced, he smiled, knowing that it marked the
start of his revenge upon the crown. His eyes sparkled at the
thought. Soon, how very soon, he very nearly cackled in delight.
And then . . . a slight but still far away sound drifted to his
ears. The three trainees were returning. Instantly he reigned
in his emotions and watched, and waited. Before too long they
came into sight and Lyon watched with a funny grin on his face,
their expression at the sight of the burning Lyceum. Oh the thrill
of it all. And then the grin had slowly faded as Mistress Joyane
had spoken to them. Lyon was too far away to hear her words and
the wind was blowing in the wrong direction for him to catch even
a hint of what was said. Then had come tears, as he should have
expected. But then that rat eyed horse had caught scent of him
somehow and warned her mistress. All he had seen after that were
their backs. As quickly as possible, he had wrenched himself into
his horse's saddle and ran after them, pushing his horse faster
and faster. Yet about a hundred and fifty marks out, the tracks
he had been following suddenly stopped. And he knew that the game
where he hunted the hunted had just begun.</P>

<P>After wandering aimlessly for nearly a position, hoping to
catch sight of the trainee's or their trail, Lyon reined in his
horse. Without dismounting, he started to contemplate his options.</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; he started and then guiltily looked around,
as if expecting to see ears and eyes in between the trees. Finally,
he settled his nerves and continued. &quot;If I were a trainee,
running from a burning Lyceum where all the teachers had been
slaughtered, where would I go? To the east? Not likely. There's
not a town to be reached within three weeks, and they're liable
to remember that from their lessons. The west? No, there's a thing
called a desert in that direction. Back south? What good would
that do them? North, toward Pathageron? That's the only logical
case. Not only do they want to reach civilization, but they're
also going to want to tell the king what they have witnessed.
One of the duties of a bard, even a trainee, is to bring news,
especially news of this magnitude. It must be told and the quickest
way to get the word spread throughout the kingdom? By telling
the king directly. Yes, I'll go to Pathageron.&quot; He gazed
on the direction of the city, and laughed quietly. &quot;The mountains,
that's where Rowan is. But they don't know that. They're traveling
right into the lion's mouth.&quot;</P>

<P>With a grim smile, he turned his horse toward the mountains
and the city which lay beyond.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&quot;Do you really think there's someone following us?&quot;
Daric asked Quint.</P>

<P>She shrugged. &quot;I don't know. Something scared Edwina back
at the Lyceum and whether it was because someone was there, or
just because she was spooked, I don't know.&quot; She met his
eyes. &quot;Do you really want to take the chance, though? Yes,
we would ride faster if we weren't watching our steps and tracks,
but if there is someone following us . . . &quot; she left the
sentence hanging.</P>

<P>&quot;Good point.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I wish we could make
a fire. It's starting to get cold at night.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I know,&quot; Quint admitted. &quot;But if there's someone
behind us, we don't want to leave him any evidence of our passing.&quot;</P>

<P>Daric sighed again. &quot;I don't know if I like this traveling
idea.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Would you two mind,&quot; Brian interrupted. &quot;There
are some people here who are trying to get some sleep.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yes, master,&quot; Quint pertly replied, then turned
back to Daric. &quot;Will you take the first watch tonight? or
do you want me to?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I can handle it,&quot; Daric answered. &quot;You get
some rest. I'll wake you up in three positions.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;All right. Don't be afraid to wake me if you hear something
out of the ordinary.&quot;</P>

<P>Daric gave her a weak smile. &quot;Don't worry, I won't be.&quot;</P>

<P>Quint laid down beside Brian, wrapped her cloak around her
body, and fell into a dark dream where bloodied and burned bodies
called out her name, blaming her for the monstrosities which had
befallen them. She could not climb out on her own, so when Daric's
hand touched her shoulder, she thankfully opened her eyes.</P>

<P>&quot;Your turn,&quot; Daric said, rubbing tired eyes.</P>

<P>Quint nodded, not trusting her voice after the nightmare. She
was too afraid that the moment she did, all the pent up screams
and emotions she held inside would escape. Standing up, she tried
to shake the memories of the dream from her mind. Daric lay down
where she had been, and she wanted to tell him not to, that that
patch of land was cursed. But she kept her mouth shut, watching
him settle down.</P>

<P>&quot;Still warm,&quot; he sighed before falling into sleep.</P>

<P>Her watch passed silently but long. With relief, she woke Brian
up for his turn, and wrapped her cloak around herself. She did
not remember falling to sleep, but the next thing she knew, Brian's
hand was on her shoulder, and the sun was rising in the sky.</P>

<P>&quot;Ugh.&quot; She gripped her head, which felt like it was
about to explode. &quot;I feel awful. I wish there was some water
around so I could clean up. Maybe that would help me feel better.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;There was a lake we passed not far from here yesterday,&quot;
Daric reminded. &quot;It couldn't be more than a mark or so away.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah, I remember it,&quot; Brian agreed. &quot;Go ahead
if you want, Quint. We'll make breakfast.&quot;</P>

<P>Quint arched an eyebrow. &quot;You and making breakfast? I
don't think I've ever heard those words before in the same sentence.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Brian agreed. &quot;But 'making breakfast'
is such a rarely used phrase that it just doesn't get used a lot
in the same sentence.&quot;</P>

<P>Quint looked at her beloved, trying to decide if he felt all
right. &quot;Never mind. I'm going to get wet now.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Sounds like fun. Can I come?&quot; Brian's eyes twinkled.</P>

<P>She threw her hands up in disgust. &quot;Men.&quot;</P>

<P>When she reached the lake, she undressed, sticking a toe in
to test the water. Not too cold for this time of day during this
time of year.</P>

<P>I've certainly had worse, she thought as she slid into the
water. Oh, good, clean water. She took a sip, seeing if it had
any effect on her head. That's much better -- I can actually think
a little. Grabbing some sand from the bottom of the lake, she
scoured herself, grimacing at its roughness. So it's not soap,
but it's better than nothing. I suppose. Half a position later,
she clambered back out, dried herself off with her cloak, and
stepped into her clothes.</P>

<P>Brian smiled as she neared them. &quot;Your berries are ready,
milady.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; Quint laughed. &quot;I see you worked especially
hard for my breakfast today. How long did they take to cook?&quot;</P>

<P>Brian pouted. &quot;I did the best I could. What more do you
want?&quot; His voice held a challenge.</P>

<P>&quot;I'm just joking with you.&quot; Quint gave him a hug.
&quot;Anything you do will be good enough for me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Anything?&quot; he slyly arched an eyebrow.</P>

<P>If she had had a pillow, she would have thrown it at him. But
she did not, so she used the next handiest weapon -- her long,
wet hair.</P>

<P>&quot;I surrender,&quot; Brian sputtered, trying to pull out
stray pieces of hair from his mouth, as well as wiping drops of
water from his face.</P>

<P>In another half of a position, they were ready to move on.</P>

<P>&quot;I didn't realize they were so big,&quot; Daric whispered,
as if afraid that one loud noise would send the whole mountain
crashing down on top of them.</P>

<P>It had taken them over half of the day to reach the foot of
the mountains, traveling hard. Quint knew the horses were tired,
she could feel the tremors running through Edwina as they reined
in. But the sun was still up, and would not be going down for
another few positions, and everyone knew they had to go on.</P>

<P>&quot;It's going to get cold up there,&quot; Brian remarked,
eyeing the snow covered tops.</P>

<P>&quot;Hopefully we won't have to go up that high.&quot; Quint
pursed her lips. &quot;Well, the sooner we go in, the sooner we
get out.&quot;</P>

<P>With that thought running through their heads, they urged the
horses up. The trail was steep and treacherous with loose rocks
threatening to maim the horse and slide them backwards, erasing
all the work that had gotten them to that point. Often they dismounted
to led the horses through the more strenuous of passages. Finally
they reached a small clearing, and even though there was still
another position worth of sun, they all stopped. Relief flowed
over everything, even the horses, as the riders dismounted. Quint
unsaddled Edwina, then rubbed the horse down with her cloak. She
knew it would smell of horse until it got washed, but she figured
it was worth it if Edwina would actually be able to carry her
the next day. The others followed her example, knowing it was
important for them to care about the animals. Night was quiet,
and in the turn of things, Quint was relegated the last watch.</P>

<P>At least it's better than the second watch. She tried to make
the most of it as Brian settled down. With a sigh, she turned
her eyes toward the darkness. But even the knowledge of the coming
sunrise could not keep the blackness from her soul. Oh, gods,
why have you abandoned us?</P>

<P>| Never fear. | The thought entered into her mind unbidden.
| You are watched. |</P>

<P>Who watches me? she tried to send the thought out.</P>

<P>| Believe in your companions, and in me. |</P>

<P>Who are you? And when no answer returned, she glanced over
at the sleeping forms of Brian and Daric. Companions -- friend
and beloved. Who could ask for better?</P>

<P>And slowly, the sun rose, painting the sky, and chased away
the shadows haunting the trainee. During the day, with the light
shining upon her, she felt invincible, but during the night, when
darkness surrounded her, she could almost feel the cold touch
of death. Therefore everyday the sun rose, she greeted it with
cheerful eyes and outstretched arms.</P>

<P>It was not long before they were ready to travel again, though
none really wanted to. But before weariness could once again settle
into their bones, they came across a trail. Quint dismounted,
studying the trail with a tilted head.</P>

<P>&quot;It looks like a group of people passed through here not
too long ago. They even had wagons,&quot; she pointed out the
long grooves.</P>

<P>&quot;What kind of people?&quot; Brian asked, angrily. &quot;Like
a group of people who destroyed the Lyceum?&quot;</P>

<P>Quint's face was unreadable as she felt her internal flame
filling with her anger. &quot;I didn't say that.&quot; Her voice
was even, cold.</P>

<P>&quot;But it's more than likely,&quot; Brian objected, his
horse fidgeting under his tense hand.</P>

<P>&quot;I didn't say that,&quot; she reiterated then waited for
him to get his horse under control. &quot;For all we know, it
could have been a group of farmers on the way to market.&quot;
Fluidly, she mounted Edwina. &quot;Let's follow the trail for
a while and see where it leads us.&quot;</P>

<P>No one argued, each knowing it would be easier and allow them
to make better time. For the rest of the day, the companions pretty
much kept to themselves, not talking to one another unless it
was necessary. And thus, dark found them a close, but silent group,
each contemplating their own private grief. As they made camp
for the night, Quint wished they dared to make a fire since it
would get colder the higher they got, but could not bring herself
to allow it. If there were someone following them . . . she shook
her head. </P>

<P>There's no need to follow that line of thought at this exact
moment. If there is someone following us, we'll deal with it when
it becomes a problem, not before. But no fire, not yet. Not until
it's either build a fire or freeze to death. Lyon had taught his
students well.</P>

<P>She took the first watch, circling her cloak tightly around
her body to help keep the cold breeze off her skin. Also to help
keep her emotions in. All of the deaths lay on her soul. Because
of her, they had all died. Some small portion of her mind wondered
how the three of them, only trainees, would become Bards with
no teachers, no school. She brought her head down to her knees,
knee caps driving into her eyes, and silently cried, rocking back
and forth. This one time, she would not allow herself to throw
all her emotions to the flame -- she needed to release them. And
when she had cried herself out, she drew a sleeve across her nose
and felt better.</P>

<P>About half a position later, she heard someone approaching.
Glancing behind her, she noted that Brian and Daric were hidden
by shadows and knew that no one would be able to see them from
a distance. After making sure of that, she crept forward, intent
on finding out who it was.</P>

<P>&quot;I told 'ou,&quot; she heard a man's voice whisper. &quot;There's
nothin' out 'ere.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I coulda swore I 'eard somethin',&quot; another voice
replied. &quot;'Guess it was jus the wind.&quot;</P>

<P>Then the footsteps went away and Quint, after seeing that Brian
and Daric were still asleep, trailed them. She did not know who
the men were, but she hoped they would lead her somewhere where
she could get some answers. Tired of going into things blindly,
Quint hoped that their leader could enlighten her.</P>

<P>Like why are the gods trying to kill me? That would be a good
start.</P>

<P>The men lead her to a camp not too far away from her own. She
circled around to the back, hoping to remain unseen from the fires
and eyes. There were about sixty men, fighters, and instantly
she knew that these were the men who had attacked the Lyceum.
Not that she could have produced proof, it was just a gut feeling
-- a feeling that rocked through her core. And then . . . she
squinted to make sure she saw him right. Red hair. All I remember
is red hair, red hair like the fire. Mistress Joyane's words echoed
in her head, making her gasp for breath. That was the man who
had led the attack, who had watched her friends and teachers,
die under sword and fire. Unthinkingly, she started forward, ready
to kill him with her bare hands. Then she remembered her place,
and held herself to the darkness of the trees behind the camp.
After a little, she decided that although she could not kill the
man right now, she would sneak in to figure out who he was.</P>

<P>The next time the clouds crossed the sky, covering the moon,
Quint raced in behind the tent the red haired man had disappeared
into.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Lyon reached the foot of the Range of Darkness, still unsure
as to whether the trainees actually traveled in front of him or
not. Quint was skilled at this game, all of his students who had
tracked her had told him as much. Never a camp fire, never a thrown
shoe, never a track -- there was never anything to follow. But
follow he did, or so he hoped. If he did not find them at Pathageron,
then he would find them somewhere else. He would keep searching
until Quint was dead. For a moment he wondered why Rowan, prince
and friend, wanted Quint killed so badly.</P>

<P>Who is she that Rowan has taken such an interest in her? For
a while he contemplated on the question, but he could not dredge
up a good answer. Filing it in his mind, he decided it would have
to wait until the next time he saw the prince.</P>

<P>Night overtook him before he had gotten too far into the mountains.
Winter was creeping in, slowly but surely, and it chilled his
bones. If all these old bones have to put up with is some cold
wind for my revenge, so be it, and let my heart rejoice. My body
has taken more of a pounding than this before. His mind circled
around. Why Quint? Why is she so different, so special?</P>

<P>She was one of the fastest learners he had ever taught, catching
onto things after being shown them once, sometimes twice for the
most difficult of moves. If something ever happened to her voice,
and she could no longer be a Bard, she would find most mercenary
companies would welcome her skill. Since she had practically grown
up at the Lyceum, he had known her for all her life. In fact,
he had truly started her dagger practice when she was around five
which explained why, with only another month's work of practice,
Quint could become a Mistress of the Dagger. He sighed, knowing
the dream could never become reality. Much as he detested the
thought of killing one of his students . . . ironically he silently
laughed until tears ran down his cheeks. What a bunch of rat's
nose. As if I haven't killed one of my students already . . .
technically I killed almost all of them! Bards are nothing, though.
What do they give the people in this kingdom? What good do they
do? They don't fight so they can't protect anyone or anything.
No . . . let me put it this way . . . they can fight with daggers
but no dagger, as they themselves found out, can stand against
a sword or arrow. They don't plow fields or raise cattle for food
nor are they lords who rule the commoners and serve the King;
Bards work for no man. What purpose do they hold?</P>

<P>Lyon buried his head underneath his arms, trying to chase away
his nagging conscience. He knew as well as any King why Bards
roamed the land and why Kings believed them to be the greatest
treasure in the land. They entertained; they made the stout-hearted
quiver and the cold-hearted cry; they created beauty from words
and instruments which could charm anyone, and most importantly,
they were the keepers of history which could transport people
into the past. Bards studied ancient songs and sometimes invented
their own songs about history, about Kings and heroes before.
From the kingdom's birth to the present, Bards knew every passing
moment. In a way Lyon did not quite understand, Bards upheld the
pride of the kingdom, they gave the people their heritage and
their future. Sobs racked his body. He had stolen the kingdom's
pride, ruthlessly hacked it down. Its blood was being soaked up
by the soil, the words of history ended. As his mind turned in
vicious spheres, Lyon fell into a dark and dreamless sleep.</P>

<P>When he awoke in the morning, the light shining upon his tear-stained
face, all misgivings had disappeared, and he knew that he held
only one task -- to track the trainees and kill Quint. As the
day passed on, he became certain that he followed the right trail,
for every once in a while he would pass signs which showed recent
traveling. A broken twig here, a misplaced footstep there -- Lyon
smiled. Surely the trainees had walked the same trail he now did.</P>

<P>Night had settled into the mountains with deep certainty, the
full moon glowing far brighter than any star. The Master of Arms
decided to keep on, hoping beyond hope that sometime during the
night he would run across the trainees' camp. He doubted they
would build a fire even though the night promised to be cold.
Grinding his teeth, Lyon drudged on.</P>

<P>Fatigued far beyond even he would admit, he feel into a stupor,
and his wandering mind feel into the hands of the gods. Lyon jerked
awake as they started talking to him, eyes wide. Although they
had, on a few occasions in the past, talked to him before, it
scared him anew every time it happened.</P>

<P>Left here. Straight a little. Left again. The thoughts were
so slight that he had trouble believing that it was not his own
mind giving him the directions. And perhaps that was what the
gods wanted him to think. And maybe he was rat tired -- that his
mind was telling him where to go. But perhaps not. He followed
the voice in his head. Right. Look through those trees. That's
where they are. Astonished, Lyon dismounted and looked through
the trees, and found a sleeping Brian and Daric by the moonlight.
If he had approached their camp by any other direction, he would
have missed them in the shadows, but at this specific point, the
moon shone down right on top of them. If he could have he would
have kissed the voice.</P>

<P>For a little, he looked for Quint since he had not seen her
sleeping with the others. Finally, as soon as he gave up, Brian
stirred, waking.</P>

<P>&quot;Quint?&quot; his ragged voice was a whisper. When no
answer reached his ears, he sat up. &quot;Quint?&quot; he asked,
louder. Gathering his feet beneath him and reslinging his cloak
across his shoulders, he walked to the outskirts of the camp.
&quot;Quint?&quot;</P>

<P>Lyon backed away, hoping to make it to his horse to sit and
wait. He did not need to get into a conversation with the trainee.
But as he stepped backwards, he trampled a dry stick.</P>

<P>How typical, he thought darkly as the loud crack bounced off
neighboring trees.</P>

<P>&quot;Who's there?&quot; Brian swung around, trying to see
in the dark. &quot;Quint? Is that you?&quot; He stepped forward,
voice uncertain, afraid.</P>

<P>Rat's fur, Lyon cursed. There's no hiding now. &quot;Brian?
It's me, Master Lyon.&quot; He walked to where Brian could see
him.</P>

<P>There was relief in Brian's posture and voice. &quot;Master
Lyon! You're not dead! How did you escape?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Nothing short of a miracle,&quot; Lyon shortly replied,
clamping a friendly hand down on Brian's shoulder. &quot;But that's
not the point. Who all is with you? How many trainees survived?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;There's Daric, Quint, and I,&quot; Brian explained. &quot;And
we haven't seen anyone else.&quot; He paused. &quot;Quint. . .
did you see her?&quot; Lyon shook his head. &quot;Where do you
suppose she is? She's on guard this watch . . . &quot; He paused
again. &quot;Do you suppose the enemy found her? Oh gods, what
trouble. We've got to go find her.&quot; The trainee took a step
into the woods, then stopped. &quot;What to do about Daric? I
won't be gone too long, he'll be fine. He's old enough to take
care of himself. Oh, Master Lyon, it's so good to see you again.&quot;
Brian was rambling and he knew it, but he was frightened by Quint's
disappearance.</P>

<P>&quot;Quint,&quot; Lyon reminded, then swept an arm out, motioning
toward the woods. &quot;You first.&quot;</P>

<P>Brian grimly nodded, going about the search with worry in his
eyes. But as soon as he reached the tree line, a sharp pain traveled
through his head and he fell to the ground, unconscious.</P>

<P>Lyon put away the dagger he had used to hit Brian and glanced
around, trying to decide what to do with the trainees he had found.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Brian groaned, dragging himself out of the darkness which had
cloaked him.</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, good.&quot; Master Lyon's voice cut through his pain.
&quot;I see you're finally awake.&quot;</P>

<P>The trainee forced his eyes to open, although for a moment,
he was dazzled from the light of the moon. &quot;I never got to
thank you for the wonderful chase you led me on. For a while,
I wasn't even certain you had headed this way. But everyone gets
lazy after a little, as you did.&quot; He crouched down besides
Brian. It was only then that the trainee realized he was sitting
down, tied to the trunk of a tree. &quot;A misstep here, a rock
that slid there -- it wasn't so hard to track you once you knew
what to look for. That's something to keep in mind for another
day in the future when you're being hunted again. But the gods
tell me it's time to go now.&quot; He stood up. &quot;I'm positive
that Daric will figure you and Quint deserted him, and that fixes
things in that direction. He can't survive in these mountains
on his own.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why?&quot; Brian croaked, trying to get the words past
his dry mouth.</P>

<P>&quot;Why?&quot; Lyon repeated, turning to look at him. &quot;Why
not?&quot; he alone laughed at his joke. &quot;Why? Because someone
once stole something that belonged to me.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;And that's what this is all about? You're trying to kill
Quint because someone once stole something from you? What kind
of rats assed . . . &quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Now Brian,&quot; Lyon admonished. &quot;There's no need
for that kind of language. And as for Quint, don't worry about
her. I'll take care of her.&quot;</P>

<P>Brian strained against the bonds that held him, succeeding
only in wearying himself further. &quot;When I next see you .
. . &quot;</P>

<P>&quot;When you next see me,&quot; Lyon interrupted, &quot;we'll
both be dead.&quot; Pulling his sword from his scabbard, he saluted
the trainee. &quot;Until then.&quot;</P>

<P>The Master of Arms started toward his horse, but the voice
stopped him. So instead he found himself suddenly turning right,
and walking horseless through the trees. A short while later,
he knew it was a good thing that he had left the horse, such an
animal could not have made his way through this undergrowth. He
smiled to himself, infinitely glad he had the gods on his side.</P>

<P>Brian had stared at Lyon's retreating back. His mind still
ached and seemed to reject everything he had just learned. He
had known Lyon for almost four years, and to suddenly know . .
. he shook his head, hoping the sudden pain of movement would
erase the tears that threatened to fall. Forcing Lyon away from
his thoughts, he made himself concentrate on getting free. Rotating
his wrists in the hopes that Lyon had left the bonds loose enough
to work his way out proved futile. He tried rubbing the rope against
the tree, but the only thing it accomplished was making his muscles
more sore. Leaning his head against the tree, he closed his eyes,
wondering how he would ever escape.</P>

<P>Through all the worries that invaded his senses, Brian fell
asleep, dropping into the world of dreams. Flashes of his life
at the Lyceum flickered before him: his first sight of Quint,
the first time he had performed for two Mistresses of Music, teachers,
friends -- it happened so quickly that Brian barely comprehended
its meaning. Then it suddenly jumped to the future, practically
jerking Brian back to the slow passing of real time. He saw the
palace at Pathageron and, though it did not seem weird in the
dream, it looked different than he had always imagined it. Out
of the corner of his eyes, he saw Quint and Daric beside him.
Suddenly the sky grew dark and Brian could feel the little hairs
at the bottom of his neck raising up in fear. The coppery taste
of fear filled his mouth as his horse reared, trying to run away.
Brian lost his grip on the beast, and as he flew through the air,
he saw a bright white lightening bolt hurling from the sky. Instantly
he knew the gods had sent it to strike down Quint, and even as
he helplessly watched, crashing onto the ground, Quint saw the
bolt and screamed. Darkness threatened to swallow Brian, but he
forced it away in time to see the lightening reach Quint . . .</P>

<P>He wrenched himself into reality, gasping for air. Sweat mixed
with tears as he regained control of his shaking body.</P>

<P>Oh, gods, Brian turned teary eyes upward.  Why have you abandoned
us?</P>

<P>Suddenly a deep calm coursed through his body and Brian felt
all his stress melt away. | Who says we have? | the unprovoked
thought reverberated in his mind, and Brian smiled in spite of
everything. Fog once again invaded his mind, and he dreamed, this
time about the present, not the future.</P>

<P>He seemed to be a ghost, a silent observer flying above the
tree tops, looking upon their camp as it had been marks before.
As he and Daric went to sleep, he followed Quint, and somehow
he heard her thoughts and realized that she still carried the
guilt of the Lyceum on her shoulders. Suddenly, two men neared
the camp and he observed their conversation. Quint went after
the men, and Brian flew after her shadow. With wide eyes he watched
all that happened, and slowly Brian came to understand that this
was not just a dream, but real life. Everything he had just witnessed
had passed, and that what he was about to see was happening even
as he dreamed about it . . .</P>
