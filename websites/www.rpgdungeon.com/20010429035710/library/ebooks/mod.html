&quot;Is this it?&quot; Ari held out an old book bound in black
leather to his father, Alinthon.</P>

<P>Alinthon took it from Ari's white hands and as he read the
words written on the page, his own white eyes widened.</P>

<P>&quot;That's it!&quot; he proclaimed. &quot;That is her destiny.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What does it say? I only got to read the first little
part . . . &quot; Ari eagerly tried to peer over his father's
shoulder.</P>

<P>Alinthon quickly side-stepped his son and turned to face him.
&quot;Listen:</P>

<P>There will be one who changes the world as men and gods know
it. And she will not even know she is doing it. Just by her birth,
by her living and breathing and dying, the world will be changed.
Gods shall die, men shall burn from fires she will call down from
above. All that meet her will be different from that meeting.
Whether for good or bad, who is to judge?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;That's it? That's all it says about the girl?&quot; Ari
wondered.</P>

<P>&quot;There's more,&quot; Alinthon admitted. &quot;But it's
not important.&quot; He gently closed the book. &quot;I want you
to find her, Ari. I want you to find her, teach her, guide her.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Why?&quot; Alinthon arched a white eyebrow. &quot;You
dare question the orders of the king of the gods? Do you truly
think I would ask you to do a task that might potentially harm
the gods or the people below? Ari, you know me better than that.&quot;</P>

<P>Ari bowed his head, white hair falling around his face. &quot;Of
course, father, I'm sorry. I'll go down at once.&quot; He started
to leave the room then turned. &quot;How will I know her?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;You'll know,&quot; Alinthon replied. &quot;Trust me,
you'll know.&quot;</P>
