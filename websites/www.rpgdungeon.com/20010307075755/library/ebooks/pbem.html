   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">ven if you've been playing RPG's
  face-to-face for two decades and know the rules of your favorite
  system inside out, then it is still very valuable to start off
  as a lurker, as you will definitely learn a great deal about
  the differences between the two types of games.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">F</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">irstly, I would suggest going
  through a number of different web sites devoted to different
  on-going PBeM campaigns. Perhaps you already have a system, such
  as AD&amp;D, that you have already played before and would like
  to play as a PBeM. But perhaps you are totally new to role playing
  and have no idea as to which games system would be the most interesting
  for you. If this is the case, then be sure to check out games
  that use as many different systems as possible, so that you can
  select the one that is going to be of most interest to you. Out
  of interest, from what I have seen from studying <A HREF="http://www.pbem.com/">Irony
  Games' Site</A>, the most popular three systems are:</FONT></P>
  <OL>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">Advanced Dungeons &amp;
    Dragons</FONT>
    <LI><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">Star Trek</FONT>

  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">A</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">s you check out a number of
  different web sites, you will see that each DM runs their game
  in a different way, with styles varying dramatically. There are
  no fixed rules as to how to run a PBeM campaign.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">A</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">lthough checking through web
  sites will give you a good idea as to what a PBeM game is all
  about, it won't give you the same experience of the game that
  the players are getting. The reason for this is that the majority
  of web sites feature only summaries of the campaigns, rather
  than a blow-by-blow account of which player's character said
  what when. In order to get the whole experience, look out for
  games that say that Lurkers are welcome and then e-mail the DM
  to say that you would like to be added to the mailing list. Don't
  be shy - the majority of DM's will be flattered at your interest
  in their campaign. A list of games which 'love lurkers' is maintained
  at the <A HREF="http://www.pbem.com/pbem-lurkers.html">Irony
  Games Site</A>, although it hasn't been updated for a very long
  time. If you are shy and don't want to bother the DM, then check
  out <A HREF="http://www.phoenyx.net/">The Phoenyx</A>. This site
  is home for the mailing lists of many PBeM's. Becoming a lurker
  in any of their games is as simple as sending a three word e-mail.
  Everything is simply explained on their site.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">I</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">t's good to lurk in more than
  one game if you really want to start playing quickly. That way,
  you should get a good cross-section of different games and get
  an idea as to the differences between them. If you haven't got
  a copy of the rules for the system that you are interested in,
  then now is the ideal time to get yourself a copy. If you haven't
  got a good games store close to you, then <A HREF="http://tracker.clicktrade.com/tracker/tracker.dll?to='http:/www.mordor.nu/'&ad=180912.0&lp=139254">Mordor
  Role Playing Games</A> will be happy to sell you the books. Once
  you have a copy of the rules, then the mechanics of the game
  should become clear to you. How long you spend at the lurker
  stage depends totally on you. Chances are that, after only a
  week or two of lurking, you'll be itching to start playing.</FONT></P>

   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">efore you run off and start
  applying to every game that you see an opening for, you need
  to have a think about whether you are really ready to start playing.
  How much time can you really spend on PBeMs? The majority of
  games vary from requiring one posting a day to one posting per
  week, with most falling somewhere in the middle. From experience,
  you should count on spending around half an hour per posting
  per game on a PBeM, taking into account the time that you will
  need to spend reading all of the postings from the DM and other
  players and then posting your own response. Are you really willing,
  or able, to make that commitment each day, or three times per
  week, or just once a week? Don't just take into account how you
  are fixed this week and next week. The majority of PBeM's are
  'open-ended', which means that they, theoretically, go on ad
  infinitum. Can you guarantee that you will have the same amount
  of time to devote to the game in a month's time? In six month's
  time? In a year's time? Sadly, a vast amount of games go belly
  up after a relatively short period of time, usually for reasons
  that could be avoided if all players and DM's took a while to
  think about things like this, but you should always go into a
  game as if it really was going to keep going for year after year.
  Are you going to have e-mail access on a continual basis? If
  you are in education and lose e-mail access during breaks, then
  you really should let the DM know this before joining a game.
  Before you apply to join any game, you should be confident that
  you will be able to commit to staying with a game that you start.</FONT></P>

   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">aving answered that important
  question, you are now ready to start looking for a game. As I
  have said in many places on this site, <A HREF="http://www.pbem.com/new/pbems.html">Irony
  Games' PBeM site</A> is the best place to go, by far, in order
  to get into a game. You will notice that, on the site, there
  is a section where you can put up a posting saying that you are
  a player looking to get into a game. Unless you are looking to
  play in a game using one of the less popular sets of rules, then
  the chances of your being contacted by DM's through one of these
  postings is quite rare, from what I understand. There is no harm
  in trying, but you are better advised to apply in response to
  a posting put up by a DM.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">I</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">f you are looking to get into
  a game using one of the three most popular formats listed above,
  then you will usually find that there are several games with
  openings advertised at any one time. Avoid the temptation of
  responding to the first posting that you see, as you will probably
  regret it later. Take a little time to check through all of the
  postings to see if there is one that really takes your eye. If
  not, then it's better to wait. In a week's time, there will undoubtedly
  be a whole new set of games to choose from.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">I</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">n my opinion, there are no hard
  and fast rules for determining which of the posted games will
  be 'good' and which will be 'bad'. Some players go for the one
  with the most amount of text, some will only go for games with
  a web site. Some will only go for games that they see have been
  running for a long time. Personally, I would never go for a game
  where the posting contained misspelling and bad grammar in every
  line, but that's just me! So just try and find a posting that
  takes your eye for any reason.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">O</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">nce you have found a posting
  that catches your eye, read all of the posting carefully. Then
  read it through another time. If there is a link to a web site,
  make sure that you read everything there is on the site about
  the campaign world very carefully. Are you sure that you are
  still interested in the campaign after finding out everything
  about it? Are you sure that you are able to comply with all of
  the requirements that the DM is looking for? The most important
  factor in PBeMs is honesty. If the DM says that he is looking
  for someone to post every day, and you can only manage a couple
  of times per week, then choose another game. If the DM is looking
  for experienced players only, and you have never played a game
  before, then choose another. If you do join a PBeM under false
  pretenses, then you will be found out sooner or later, and it
  will create a lot of bad feelings between you, the DM and the
  other players.</FONT></P>

   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">ay close attention to what the
  DM asks you to provide him or her with and make sure that you
  follow his or her requirements as closely as possible. If you

  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">U</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">sually, the DM will ask you
  to submit a character. Either they will ask for a complete character
  sheet, or just a background story for your character. Designing
  the character is probably the most important stage of the process
  for a player. It is a good idea, at this point, to bear in mind
  the advantages and disadvantages of PBeMs compared with face-to-face
  games.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">P</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">robably the main disadvantage
  of PBeMs is that they move incredibly slowly compared to face-to-face
  games. Scenarios that could be completed in an evening of face-to-face
  gaming could take a year to run through in a slow-moving PBeM.
  This is worth bearing in mind if, for example, your PBeM features
  a lot of combat and you are planning on your character being
  a 1st Level Magic-User, for example. If this is the case, then
  your character is going to be spending a lot of time with little
  to do after he or she has cast his or her one and only spell.
  Combat, in general, is another disadvantage of PBeMs, as it tends
  to lose the excitement of rolling the dice that is an important
  part of face-to-face games. As a result, most well-run PBeMs
  tend to accentuate the role playing element of games, and you
  would be well advised to take this into account when designing
  a character.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">T</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">he main advantage of PBeMs is
  that role playing can be enhanced compared with a face-to-face
  game. In most face-to-face games, most players tend to get caught
  up in the excitement of a game so that they do not role play
  to the full. In most cases, games end up in a situation where
  players are role playing themselves role playing their characters
  - a shy and retiring player will almost inevitably end up playing
  a shy and retiring character. In addition to this factor, most
  of the face-to-face games that I have played in lose a lot as
  a result of players chatting amongst themselves when they are
  not actively involved and as a result of the wisecracks that
  are usually going backwards and forwards while the game is in
  progress. PBeMs are a lot more focused than face-to-face games
  which, for me, results in a much more immersive role playing
  experience.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">T</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">o get the most out of a PBeM,
  I think it is important to come up with strong characters that
  can be played in a strong style. While you are putting your character
  together, try to think about how the character will react during
  the game. How will the character talk? For me, the most enjoyable
  games have come from having strong characters with their own
  unique personalities. If you're involved in a game where you
  don't have to see the character's name to know who said what,
  then it is a sign that the character is being well played. If
  you are short of ideas for interesting characters to play, then
  it can be a good idea to read some good fantasy literature. Pay
  attention as to how the characters in the book talk and react
  to each other. A good PBeM should give an observer the impression
  that he or she is watching a good novel unfolding as it goes
  along.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">S</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">o, you've developed a good character
  and you've submitted it to the DM. What happens next? It is a
  sad situation that, in many cases, nothing will happen. A lot
  of games will just simply not happen because the DM hasn't really
  thought the process through properly and isn't committed enough
  to carry the project through. A lot of DM's get inundated with
  responses to a posting and have to turn players away. I think
  it is very rude of DM's to just ignore people who have taken
  the time and trouble to submit a character, but it happens time
  and time again, unfortunately. If this happens to you, then don't
  despair. The character that you have developed can easily be
  filed away and brought out for submission for another campaign,
  as new ones are starting all of the time. If you keep on applying
  to enough games then, sooner or later, you will eventually be
  admitted to a game.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">D</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">oes this mean that you will
  be guaranteed of your character being a part of a game that goes
  on year after year? Unfortunately not, in my experience. Even
  after your character has been admitted into a game, it often
  happens that the game never starts - again, usually for the reason
  that the DM was not ready to run a campaign, has got cold feet,
  and baled out. Even if the game does start, a large number fall
  apart in the first few weeks. Sometimes this is the DM's fault
  for losing interest in the game, or finding that it is more work
  than he or she can cope with, and sometimes it is the players'
  fault as, in many instances, they fall away from the campaign
  very early on, which can be disheartening for even the most committed
  of DM's. In either of these circumstances, my advice is the same.
  Just start the process again and find another game to join. If
  you are committed enough, then you will eventually find a good
  game that goes the full distance and you should be amply rewarded
  for your patience.</FONT></P>
