<P>"Yes, a new life is just what you need, James Tinsdale," said a relatively old 
man in a wheel chair with a light Irish accent. He looked to James through thick 
bottle cap glasses, on the verge of sliding down off his wrinkled nose. His pure 
white hair was combined back neatly, better than what he could do himself, James 
surmised.</P>
<P>"That sounds good, doesn’t it James?" asked James’s mother. She seemed nervous 
about being here, almost to the point of being desperate that it will work. She 
was an attractive woman in her early forties who tried her hardest to give James 
the best in life. Just when every path seemed to be exhausted, the letter came, 
and another opportunity, another path opened up.</P>
<P>"Yeah, a chance to start again. Exciting, isn’t it champ," added his father, 
trying to get James to feel better about the situation. He was a large man with a 
full black beard, tinted with white streaks. His dark brown eyes were soft and 
gentle while looking to his child.</P>
<P>"Sure, whatever," replied James, trying to keep from making eye contact with 
anyone and everyone around him.</P>
<P>There was a moment of silence in the large office as the two parents shifted 
uneasily. It wasn’t like most offices, dull and sterile, used for work alone. 
This one had energy to it, like the purpose was for life. There were personal 
touches that made it seem like this had been this man’s private place for a long 
time and will be for a long time to come. There were paintings, trophies, 
strange figurines on a shelf behind the old man, and other collector’s items 
from various cultures around the world. Oddly enough, though, there were no 
pictures of loved ones. James wondered how a man as old as he is could have no 
pictures of family or friends.</P>
<P>"Do I detect a tinge of sarcasm in your voice?" said the old man. He smiled 
softly to James’s parents in understanding, letting them know he was not 
offended. They relaxed visibly, believing James would almost assuredly be 
accepted.</P>
<P>"Well, Professor Johnson, he is a little upset. He wanted so bad to drive up 
here by himself, but when we told him that you didn’t allow cars from the 
outside, he burst into a fit," said his mother.</P>
<P>"Really," commented Professor Johnson, staring at James intently.</P>
<P>James felt a little uneasy for a moment, like he was being turned inside out 
to be examined. He shook his head and looked into the professor’s eyes. 
"Interesting," commented James to himself.</P>
<P>"I’m sure he will get used to it. Mind if I spend a little time with the boy 
alone, just him and me? My assistant will show you around."</P>
<P>"Well, I don’t see why not, do you, Hun?" asked Mr. Tinsdale.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tinsdale looked to her husband and then to the Professor. "Not at all, if 
James doesn’t mind, that is."</P>
<P>James did not take his eyes off Professor Johnson’s eyes. "Sure, go ahead."</P>
<P>His parents smiled and got up to leave the room, meeting with the secretary 
outside, who began to give them a tour of the school. The assistant was a very 
attractive young girl, early to mid-twenties with curly hair that hung just past 
her shoulders. "Hello," she said. "My name is Amy and I’ll be showing you 
around the school today."</P>
<P>James’s mother said, "Hello Amy. The building and area is beautiful."</P>
<P>Amy smiled. "Thank you. We have a dedicated custodian team that works 
hard to keep the grounds looking as good as they can be."</P>
<P>"How old are the grounds?" asked Mr. Tinsdale.</P>
<P>Amy thought for a moment while walking ahead of them. "The original 
building was constructed in the early eighteen hundreds and has gone through 
several renovations."</P>
<P>Mr. Tinsdale widened his eyes. "Impressive. How long as the Professor been 
here? He seems quite…old so one would think he’s been here a while."</P>
<P>"Dick!" called out Mrs. Tinsdale. "Don’t say that. He seems like a sweet 
man."</P>
<P>Amy giggled. "The school has been connected to him all his life."</P>
<P>"Did he go to school here" asked Mrs. Tinsdale.</P>
<P>"Well," Amy started then bumped into a large man. "Oh…W…Walian."</P>
<P>He paused for a moment. Walian stood tall in an expensive suit and tie with 
his long blonde hair pulled back into a tight ponytail. His face seemed rock 
solid and unmoving, which worried James’s parents due to his recent problems with 
authority.</P>
<P>"Amy…I was just about to see the Professor about…oh, pardon me." Walian 
noticed James’s parents and turned to bow slightly to them in a show of respect. 
"Gree…hello. My name is Walian Lakenshore. I am a teacher here at the 
school."</P>
<P>"Oh," stuttered James’s mother. "Um…well…what do you teach?"</P>
<P>"Mint…err…"</P>
<P>"Mathematics, Mrs. Tinsdale," interrupted Amy. "Walian is from another 
country and his English is a little ragged."</P>
<P>"Yes…mathematics," muttered Walian.</P>
<P>"Oh, well James’s always been good at math," stated Mr. Tinsdale proudly. 
"He’ll do good in your class…should he have you."</P>
<P>"Um…can you see the Professor later, Walian?" asked Amy. "He is busy at 
the moment with the Tinsdale’ son, James."</P>
<P>Walian nodded. "Yes…I believe it can wait. Good day to you both Mr. and Mrs. 
Tinsdale." He bowed slightly again and turned to walk off. Amy smiled and 
continued showing them around the school and telling them facts about the 
faculty, the school as a whole, and other pertinent facts.</P>
<P>"Well, James," smiled the Professor softly. "You wanted to drive up here, did 
you?"</P>
<P>"You can drop the act, Johnson," replied James. His whole being was alive and 
active, alert for anything dangerous. Something was different about the room and 
the man behind the desk. If only he could get a handle on what was going on 
around him.</P>
<P>Professor Johnson arched his eyebrow. "Where I come from, James, you do not talk 
to your elders in that manner."</P>
<P>"And where is that, exactly?" asked James, almost glaring at Professor Johnson. 
"I bet if I jumped across this table to tackle you I would fall flat on my face. 
Hard to tackle something that would not be there when I get over the desk." 
James’s muscles began to tense and constrict, readying for the pounce.</P>
<P>"Well, no James. Actually you would freeze just after your rear left the seat. 
I wanted to talk to you, not fight you," said Professor Johnson. He smiled to show 
he was a friend and asked, "Would you like some tea?"</P>
<P>James thought for a moment then shook his head. "No."</P>
<P>The Professor laughed softly. "You must be a very cautious young man to not 
even accept tea from a person offering you a new chance." He smiled and 
interlocked his fingers together. "How did you know I was not human?"</P>
<P>James smiled, sitting back in his chair. "This room has something about it 
that makes it…interesting. You scanning me kinda gave it away too. When I looked 
into your eyes I could tell instantly that you weren’t human. There is also the 
fact that your name is Johnson doesn’t exactly match with the slight Irish accent 
you have."</P>
<P>"Most don’t pick up on that little minor detail. I am impressed."</P>
<P>"Thank you. My question now is what are you?" asked James, staying wary of his 
surroundings.</P>
<P>"I am a being that wants to help you," replied the Professor firmly. "That is 
why I sent the invitation and the scholarship. I sensed your presence and wanted 
to guide you into maturing your powers." Professor Johnson reached into a desk 
drawer and pulled out a piece of paper. "Would you be so kind as to fill this 
sheet out?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>James took the paper and looked at it. "A Cythrian Test?" He put the paper on 
the desk and said, "Don’t bother, I can tell you what I can do. I have a high 
degree of mystical control with advanced weapons training, specializing in, but 
not exclusive to, melee weapons. I also have a high level of martial arts 
training, both human and otherworld styles."</P>
<P>Professor Johnson’s eyes grew wide. "I’m impressed. Very impressed. Most people 
your age are barely into their third circle of mage training, and that is if 
they started from birth. Surely with that much power you have some experience in 
one of the otherworlds."</P>
<P>"One? I’ve been to at least ten in the past six months alone," replied 
James.</P>
<P>"I see…and just what do you do in these worlds?" asked Professor Johnson.</P>
<P>James could tell the Professor was trying to gain a feel of James’s personality 
as well as capabilities. He could feel that same scanning he felt before and he 
decided to show off a little. "Ever hear of a guy named Mistshrak?" asked 
James.</P>
<P>"Yes. A very powerful warlord, indeed. In the realm of Islia, correct? I 
heard he was defeated and that land was set free to the people. Why do you 
mention him?"</P>
<P>"Who do you think took him down?" replied James with a cocky grin.</P>
<P>"You? Impossible!" scoffed the Professor. "I have heard of countless others 
that tried and could not get past the front gate. How could you destroy his 
army?"</P>
<P>"Simple, I didn’t try to destroy his army. The citizens of the land now 
employ them. I issued a challenge to Mistshrak directly. He was a warrior, 
living by a warrior code of might makes right. If he refused a challenge, his 
followers would view him in a bad light. Took the battle to the plains of Nemac 
near his castle. Didn’t stand much of a chance."</P>
<P>"You used your magic?" asked Professor Johnson.</P>
<P>"Course not!" said James is a wry smirk. "If I did that I would have lost the 
respect of his troops and they would have slaughtered me. Even if I did lose, I 
would have had the respect of an honorable death."</P>
<P>"But you won, how? It is well know that he was a great warrior."</P>
<P>"Key word in that statement is <I>was</I>," replied James. "He lived on 
reputation, letting himself go. I’m sure he didn’t realize it until I had him on 
his knees crying like a baby."</P>
<P>"So you killed him execution style I take it," said Professor Johnson.</P>
<P>"Oh no. I let him live. His warriors finished the job."</P>
<P>Professor Johnson smiled. "I see, very resourceful. I believe that tells me why 
you wanted to drive here now and why you were upset when you heard about our 
rule."</P>
<P>"Oh really? Enlighten me, Professor."</P>
<P>"Your parents described how your life seemed to fall apart. They had no idea 
why, but I suspected it had something to do with your powers. I did not know how 
much knowledge you possessed and so I was slightly confused. Now I know you are 
far more knowledgeable than I could imagine at your stage in life and you wanted 
to take any troubles that might follow you from the otherworlds with you into 
seclusion. Very smart…and honorable indeed, but I am afraid I can not allow 
that."</P>
<P>"Why not? You don’t know what I have to face almost monthly," said James. He 
started to count on his fingers, "Bounty hunters, assassins, mercenaries, people 
looking to try to make a name for themselves somewhere…"</P>
<P>"I don’t know? Tell me, you have only had your powers for a few years and you 
are in trouble with a few creatures with some power to back up their wish to see 
you harmed or killed. Imagine how many I have offended. Forces even you can not 
imagine bombard me almost daily. I have lived a long time with the fear that 
this school will be overrun with a force greater than me, seeking the students 
here that are growing in strength, but I have overcome it by living with it. You 
will too.</P>
<P>"Thanks for the pep talk, but I…"</P>
<P>"You will stay. I will know where you are at all times, James."</P>
<P>"How, your super senses?" asked James.</P>
<P>"That, and the school cars we provide you have tracking devices on them, and 
when they are disabled, the car is disabled. Between the two, you are stuck 
here."</P>
<P>James frowned and sulked. "Great."</P>
<P>"It isn’t so bad, James. You know a great deal about yourself, and you have 
achieved a high level of power in what you have, but it is based on war, 
fighting, and destruction." The Professor turned his wheelchair to his right to 
look out a window to the courtyard in the center of the building. "A balance 
must be achieved in your magic, your skills, and your inner self before your 
true strength can be tapped."</P>
<P>"Not all of it, Professor Johnson. I can do things that do not destroy."</P>
<P>"Like what?" asked the professor.</P>
<P>James stretched his hand out, palm up, and created an apple out of thin air. 
"I can create things too."</P>
<P>"That is a mere illusion," replied Professor Johnson.</P>
<P>"What? You haven’t even looked at it, how could you know if it was real or 
not?"</P>
<P>"I can feel it, James," said the Professor. "Rather…I can feel the absence of 
it. Your true emotions are blocked away, hidden deep inside of you. When you 
first found out about yourself, you denied it, then when it would not leave you 
alone you closed up everything except the love for your girl friend. Now nothing 
you do has the feeling behind it that to allow your powers to grow. That apple 
is as empty as your inner being. It will fade away when you drop it to the 
ground."</P>
<P>James dropped the apple, but it never hit the ground. "I’ll stay."</P>
<P>"Good. By now your parents are done with the tour and their minds are prompt 
to be blocked in a similar manner to your girlfriend Dawn’s mind. They will 
only think of you in a dreamlike state."</P>
<P>"That would be best, I suppose," replied James. His mind reeled at the thought 
that this place would be his home from now on, unless he could find a way to 
escape.</P>
<P>"Yes. The less they know about what happens here, the better."</P>
<P>"So, are all the students here like me? More than human?" asked James.</P>
<P>"No, only a small percentage of the students are gifted, the rest are 
children of wealthy families. We provide an excellent education, more so than 
most places."</P>
<P>James smiled, "Because your teachers are more than human I take it, allowing 
them to teach both normal humans and us."</P>
<P>"Correct. I shall have my assistant show you to your room. Your roommate is 
like you. He knows about his powers. Most here do not. We slowly introduce them 
to their powers until they are conscious about them. By that time, they are 
mentally prepared to accept them."</P>
<P>"How many know of their powers?" asked James.</P>
<P>"You and your roommate. He was introduced to his powers abruptly, damaging 
him some. I will let him tell you about it if he feels like it."</P>
<P>James looked at the Professor and said, "Was he forced into a battle?"</P>
<P>"In a way. Best if he tells you. When you meet him you will understand 
why."</P>
<P>"Ok," said James. He got up out of his seat and headed for the door.</P>
<P>Once outside the office, Amy greeted James and walked him to his room. 
James looked at her as they walked. "Um…hello there. What’s your name again?"</P>
<P></P>
<P>The girl smiled and blushed slightly, "Amy."</P>
<P>"Really? That’s a nice name," said James. He felt a twinge of pain when he 
said that, like he was forsaking Dawn.</P>
<P>"What about your girlfriend? You forget them that easily?" asked Amy, 
walking a little bit ahead of James as to not show her grin.</P>
<P>"Now that isn’t fair…" started James.</P>
<P>"I know, but I don’t think anything can work between us."</P>
<P>"Huh? What do you mean?" asked James, trying to back out of a potentially 
damaging situation.</P>
<P>"I am six hundred and ninety two years old. I can tell when someone is trying 
to flirt with me." Amy giggled as if she were sixteen.</P>
<P>"I…uh…I mean…" stuttered James.</P>
<P>Amy stopped and turned to face him. "It’s ok. I understand that you lost 
those people close to you and you need something or someone to fill that void. 
And as for my age, I’m not human at all."</P>
<P>"At all?" asked James.</P>
<P>"Not really."</P>
<P>"What…"</P>
<P>"I was created to serve the Professor. Made to be strong to protect him if 
needed and intelligent to serve his every need."</P>
<P>"Every need?" asked James.</P>
<P>Amy gave him a sideways look. "Just like a teenage human boy. Always 
thinking of sex. Professor Johnson does not have those needs." She smirked and 
turned to walk on.</P>
<P>James reached out to grab Amy’s arm at the wrist to feel for a pulse. 
There was nothing except for a slight hard undersurface that did not feel like 
bone. "Galataea?"</P>
<P>"Basically," smiled Amy before starting off again to James’s room. James 
quickly caught up to her. They reached the hallway where his room was and turned 
down it, walking until she stopped in front of a door that was decorated in a 
very interesting way, patterns, colored streaks, etc.</P>
<P>"This is your room. Your roommate is unique, but a great guy. I spent a lot 
of time with him and we are good friends, so be nice to him or I’ll kick your 
butt."</P>
<P>James smiled at her and said, "I’ll try."</P>
<P>"Good. I’ll see you later. Professor Johnson is calling me." She waved bye, 
smiling, and walked off.</P>
<P>James stood there looking at the door, wondering who, or what, was behind it. 
Suddenly, the door opened and out popped a boy about his age with wild red hair. 
"YOU JAKE?!?!" he shouted excitedly.</P>
<P>"Um, yeah," relied James, chuckling slightly.</P>
<P>"Get in!!" said the boy, grabbing James and pulling him into the room.</P>
