The ForeverQuest Project was born from the belief that Role-playing
should be a consistent activity on all the EverQuest servers.
The ForeverQuest Project teams are dedicated to bringing to life
epic stories on the stage Verant has created. So we ask that for
a while you leave behind all things mundane and prepare yourself
to enter a world of love, intrigue, and magic... <BR>
<HR><BR>
Within him there was the power of creation... The power to take
emptiness and form wholeness. From this power the nameless one
took and created the foundation that all worlds are made of, stone.
He then took this stone and created small pieces of stone with
which he instilled the power to create as well.. He then cast
these stones out among the void to create what we now know as
the universe.. The nameless one also named these stones... Being
<BR>
and the force that keeps the world alive, he named these stones
Heartstones... Simpolyzing their role in the universe.. The stones
then went out and created the worlds that are here today, and
even some that have long been forgotten.. It was this moment that
the actual term time came to be, for this was the beginning of
the universe.. <BR>
