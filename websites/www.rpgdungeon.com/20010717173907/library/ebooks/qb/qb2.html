<P>Lorne spun, sweeping his blade low at the legs of the hologram, continuing 
the move to strike at the chest, catching the hologram’s sword as it defended 
itself. He forced himself closer to the hologram, trying to use brute strength 
to hammer down its guard-</P>
<P>-and the hologram fought him off, sword moving with almost superhuman 
quickness, blocking each of his moves. Now he was on the defensive, and began to 
give ground. The man grinned triumphantly in victory, so focused on his win that 
he didn’t see the handle slip up and strike him on the chin. He staggered back, 
and Lorne swung his blade, killing him in one blow. It passed <I>through</I> 
him, and he stood up straight.</P>
<P>"Another fight?" he inquired in a neutral voice.</P>
<P>"No," Lorne said, breathing heavily. He stood where he was for a moment, then 
stumbled over to the showers, sword disappearing except for a handle. He set it 
on the rack, the device would wait for the next person, and become a holographic 
projection of any weapon they wanted, the handle providing the only real part of 
it. He stretched, groaning at his sore muscles. He went towards the showers, to 
wash the sweat of mock-battle from himself.</P>
<P>The <I>sluah dhe’sidhean </I>had become an advanced society, basing their 
advancement on the research Centres, the fertile minds within providing the 
fodder for new inventions and ideas. And the society had prospered, gradually 
growing, spreading out, forced to test its boundaries by its growing population. 
And when they had reached the boarders of their home continent, the mages had 
arrived.</P>
<P>The horror stories of their first arrival still circulated around gathering 
places when the shadows lengthened and the moon was dark. How they had brutally 
slaughtered most of the coastline cities, razing the buildings and destroying 
all traces of civilization until it was hard to believe anything had been there 
before. The spectacular stories of the mages themselves, as if something from 
some far-off tale, were guaranteed to survive long after this bloody war 
ended.</P>
<P>If it did.</P>
<P>For more than forty years the <I>dalraech dhe’aon</I> had fought viciously 
against the people, giving no quarter, never letting the beleaguered citizens a 
moments rest. The boundaries between society and the wilderness created by 
magick from their very cities shifted and swayed, here pushing out when the 
Centres came out with a new weapon, moving back when the mages used new spells. 
Over the years the stakes rose, the weapons of destruction growing so that if 
uncountered, the only option left was annihilation. And so both the races 
toiled, trying to out-think, out-smart, out-fight the other. And through all of 
this no one knew from whence the warrior mages came.</P>
<P>But their newest spell heralded the end of the <I>sluah dhe’sidhean </I>and 
their way of life, a spell that affected machinery, broke it down, made it 
almost impossible to use. And if something wasn’t done soon, the mages would 
destroy them all.</P>
<P>And so the people of Science were forced to develop new tactics, where each 
man must face down a mage, and guns were useless. And that’s when they had 
reinstated the old weapons, swords and battleaxes, bows and maces, to try gamely 
at killing the silvery people of magick.</P>
<P>The Centre had adapted, developing new weapons, and the newest of them, the 
Quantum blade, was supposed to be enough to throw back the assault, and secure 
their hold on the land.</P>
<P>If the scientists could only get it right.</P>
<P>"Dammit!" Nik kicked the metal contraption beside him. It clinked 
apologetically. "Why won’t you work!" he said between teeth gritted in 
frustration.</P>
<P>"Kicking the machine is only going to make things worse," said someone behind 
him. Nik whirled around. Jim stood with a sheaf of papers in hand, grinning 
widely.</P>
<P>"Why are you smiling?" Nik said, a kernel of hope flashing in his eyes.</P>
<P>Jim reverently held up the papers silently, eyes shining with excitement.</P>
<P>Nik’s mouth dropped.</P><NO_INDEX>

<P>Lorne sat down silently beside Ronan, bowl in hand. He ate in silence, until 
his friend took it upon himself to break the silence. </P>
<P>"I hear we’re scheduled to return to the front lines today."</P>
<P>Lorne nodded silently.</P>
<P>"I heard from the general that they mages have almost reached the outlying 
Centres, is that why they’re calling us in?"</P>
<P>Lorne looked at him. "If they get their hands on any of the information in a 
Centre, we can kiss this war good-bye, and try our luck on the seas, because the 
only way for us to survive would be to run."</P>
<P>Ronan grimaced. "That bad?"</P>
<P>Lorne nodded, silent, again.</P>
<P>"What about the new weapon, the thing the Centre’s been working on?"</P>
<P>"To tell you the truth, I don’t think it exists. It’s just a cover-up to keep 
the people from rioting. It’s over, Ronan. It’s over."</P>
<P>Ronan grabbed Lorne’s arm. "Don’t ever say that! It’s not over! Not while 
we’re alive! We can still win this, we can! And even if we can’t, I’m not going 
to stay here and wait for them to come for me! I’m going to them, and take as 
many with me as possible! So stop talking like that!" he was standing now, and 
the rest of the hall had gone silent.</P>
<P>Ronan was just about to sit when a voice hailed him form the end of the hall. 
"Brown! Fleary! Get over here!" they walked quickly over to the man.</P>
<P>"Got a new assignment for you boys, somethin’ interesting," the man drawled, 
handing them both folders. "Report to the Centre when you’re finished."</P>
<P>The two men looking wonderingly at the unmarked folders, and opened them.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Lorne looked at Ronan nervously, then at the Centre. An intimidating 
building, the Centre rose a modest five stories, but ran up to ten stories under 
the ground, the lowest levels reserved for the projects of most importance. No 
one knew how low the building ran, and the two men both held security clearance 
passes for level thirteen. Thirteen. After hesitating a moment longer, they as 
one entered the building.</P>
<P>The guard at the entrance grunted at the sight of their uniforms, and when 
they showed him their clearances, he silently bade them to follow, and headed 
for a set of elevator doors.</P>
<P>Ronan raised his eyebrows at Lorne, and said nothing as they descended. The 
silence stretched uncomfortably long as the descent lengthened, the two 
visitors’ eyes growing larger as the scale of the building began to sink in. 
Then a soft chime sounded, and the elevator stopped. The doors hissed open, and 
the guard stepped out. The men followed warily, and stopped at what they 
saw.</P>
<P>A vaulted ceiling was above, making room for the mammoth machinery that 
spotted the hall. Men and women worked around the machines, and at the smaller 
labs that dotted the room.</P>
<P>The guard motioned again for them to follow, and the men complied, noticing 
that complete silence had fallen over the room. Some of the scientists looked 
their way, but most kept studiously to their work.</P>
<P>Finally they approached another set of door, and these the guard pushed open, 
and when the men followed, they stopped suddenly.</P>
<P>The room was simple, and only three people were in it, none of which were 
familiar to the two swordsmen, but something about it made them both acutely 
uneasy.</P>
<P>The guard took out a small device, and then pressed a red button on it, and 
then suddenly the room behind them became a riot of noise, people talking, 
machines humming.</P>
<P>"These are only security measures, you realize," one of the men said easily, 
eyes darting to their hair. He smiled faintly. "There’s too much at risk to let 
any mistakes happen."</P>
<P>"And why are we here?" Lorne said, voice rising. He didn’t like being played 
around with, though fear probably was the reason he suddenly was all 
bluster.</P>
<P>"You are going to undertake a mission of grave importance, one that you are 
suited for as no one else can be. A small pause here and another cold smile for 
their hair. "Your Commander tells me you have adapted the quickest to our new 
style of fighting?" the scientist raised his eyebrows, and then continued. "So 
we have selected you for a covert mission, as it were. I assume you read the 
briefing?" Ronan and Lorne nodded numbly. "Good. Any questions?" the two men 
shook their heads.</P>
<P>"No-I mean- I have one," said Lorne. "It’s all true? You actually made a 
blade…" his voice trailed off as they were presented with two swords, in 
ordinary, even beat-up looking sheaths.</P>
<P>"Don’t be fooled by the appearances, that’s for lesser souls." The scientist 
smiled slightly, and took hold of one of the handles. "These are actually 
magnetic fields, with the sheath made around them. No material could hold the 
swords." He pulled slightly, and a slow tearing noise, like thunder, rippled 
through the air.</P>
<P>The blade looked a bit thinner than most swords, until the scientist turned 
it sideways, and the men were astonished to find that the actual sword was 
normally sized, the blade was just so thin you couldn’t see it on an angle. A 
blue glow seemed to hover around the edge. The men stared, captivated.</P>
<P>"The blue is from the air particles splitting around the edge," the scientist 
said softly. "Any sharper and it would split the very atoms in the air. The only 
weapon that we have against the <I>dalraech dhe’aon.</I>" He grimaced, as if the 
word left a bad taste in his mouth. "We believe it’s sharp enough to cut through 
magickal energy, cut through spells." He watched carefully for the men’s 
reactions. Lorne was stunned, Ronan looked nonplussed. </P>
<P>"Why don’t we bring out a demonstration?" Jim said softly from behind 
him.</P>
<P>Nik nodded, sheathing the sword. He handed it to Lorne, while Jim handed one 
to Ronan. Nik turned, and Jared wheeled in a metal man, setting him up in front 
of the men.</P>
<P>"This manikin is made from a cast of solid titanium." Nik said. "Try chopping 
at it with your old swords, go ahead."</P>
<P>Lorne whipped his out, and slammed it against the dummy with all the force he 
could muster. Not so much as a mark was left on the model, but Lorne’s sword 
edge chipped, much to his disgust.</P>
<P>"Now carefully! Use the quantum blade."</P>
<P>Quantum blade. So that was the name of these swords. Lorne carefully grasped 
the hilt of his sword, and jerked it out.</P>
<P>Thunder cracked, and the blade shined blue. Lorne looked uneasily at the 
scientists.</P>
<P>"Now gently lay it on the dummy." Nik instructed.</P>
<P>Lorne obeyed, and when the sword came to rest on the dummy’s head, it slid 
easily through, as if through butter.</P>
<P>"You must always be careful not to expect resistance when you swing," Jim 
said warningly. "No substance can halt its path."</P>
<P>"And if I dropped it?" Ronan said dryly, without looking up from his 
inspection of the blade.</P>
<P>"The hilt would stop its progress."</P>
<P>"And the metal is strong enough to not break when that thin?" Ronan 
pressed.</P>
<P>"We’ve tested it thoroughly." The scientist answered smoothly.</P>
<P>Ronan nodded, satisfied.</P>
<P>"And this is the only defense we’re taking with us?" Lorne said hoarsely.</P>
<P>The scientist tilted his head to one side. "What did you expect, to go with 
some guns and blast your way out? No, this requires more finesse than that, I’m 
afraid," the scientist said, lips turned upwards.</P>
<P>"But it can’t possibly work! They’re sure to notice, and then…" Lorne 
stopped. The full impact of Ronan’s words in the mess hall ran home. Take out as 
many as possible. "There’s nothing else left to do, is there?" he said 
quietly.</P>
<P>The scientists shook their heads slightly.</P>
<P>Lorne sagged slightly, as if collapsing inward slightly. "Fine. Well," he 
said, perking up. "If there’s nothing else then I guess we’ll be going…"</P>
<P>"Don’t show the swords to anyone," warned a scientist. "Keep them secret 
until the right time."</P>
<P>"The right time," mused Lorne, and Ronan nodded. The guard led them 
out.</P><NO_INDEX>
