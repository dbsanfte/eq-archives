   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">fter you've been playing PBeMs
  for a while, chances are that you will one day think that you
  would love to start one of your own. Good luck to you, but before
  you go and put up a posting on <A HREF="http://www.pbem.com/new-game.html">Irony
  Games' Message Board</A> to find some players, STOP - you have
  a LOT to do before you're ready for that stage.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">T</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">he first question that you need
  to ask yourself is whether you have sufficient time available
  to you to run a PBeM. I said above that a player should allocate
  around half an hour per posting to have sufficient time to play
  a PBeM. As a DM, you need to spend more time than that on the
  game - a lot more time. In my experience, I have found that each
  posting takes between one and two hours in order to read all
  of the players' postings, compose my posting and to come up with
  the story and encounters that comprise the game. Even if you
  are planning to post only once or twice a week, this is still
  a major time investment. As is the case with being a player,
  you also need to bear in mind the longevity of the game. Can
  you see yourself being in a position to carry on with the game
  a month from now, six months from now, a year from now? If you
  can't then either don't start a game, or think about running
  a game that just runs for a limited amount of time, but make
  sure that your players know this in advance.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#af0000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">I</FONT></B><FONT
   FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">f you're positive that you can
  spare sufficient time to run a PBeM, then do as much of the planning
  for your campaign as you can before you start to look for players.
  If you are planning to run your campaign in a commercially available
  universe, such as AD&amp;D's 'Forgotten Realms' or 'Greyhawk'
  universe, then a lot of your work will be done for you. If you
  have decided to start a universe of your own, then you will need
  to write a great deal of background to the universe so that you
  can give it to your players. Take a look through this site to
  see the amount of material that players need in order to understand
  the background to a world. All of the background was given to
  players before the game started running. As well as a background,
  you need to have decided upon the mechanics of the games. Which
  rules will you be using? Will you be using any optional rules,
  or rules of your own that you have made up? How do you want players
  to generate their characters? How often will you be looking for
  players to post? How many players do you want to take part in
  your campaign? All of these questions need to be answered before
  you start to look for players. In addition, you also need to
  know the basics of the adventure that they will be starting on.
  You need to know how the players will meet up, and also the starting
  adventure that they will be going on. While it can be frustrating
  for players if you railroad them into doing certain actions,
  it is a lot more frustrating to get them all started in the game
  and then for the DM to have no idea as to what to do with them!
  In Bohavia, I came up with a number of goals for the party to
  achieve. There is a long-term goal, which is to free the country
  from the tyranny of the bad guys - a goal which should take several
  years of gaming to achieve, a medium term goal, such as getting
  the gnome back home, and a series of short term goals, such as
  getting out of a city, or fighting off an enemy ambush. It is
  not necessary to plan months of gaming in advance, but it is
  a good idea to have the first month of the campaign worked out
  in advance.</FONT></P>

  spent a good deal of time on putting your campaign together,
  then you should be sure not to throw a posting together in a

  about the game is included in the posting. Here is a check-list
  of all of the information that should be included in the posting:</FONT></P>

   COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">his is the vital
  information that should all be included in your posting. Some
  DM's will add pages of prose about the starting adventure and
  background in their posting, but personally I don't think that
  it is necessary to give out all of this information at this stage
  - just enough to catch potential players' attention.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">I</FONT></B><FONT
   COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">f you've put
  together a well prepared posting for a popular game system, then
  prepare to be bombarded by submissions from interested players.
  You should acknowledge receipt of all players' submissions with
  a quick reply. This is also the right time to send players full
  information about the campaign which you should have prepared
  earlier. Chances are that, by the closing date, you will have
  many more people interested in playing in your game than you
  will be able to accept. You should already know in advance how
  many players you are going to accept into your campaign. It can
  be difficult to know in advance how many players is the 'right'
  number. If you have too many players, then it can get very difficult
  to keep control of the game. The more players you have, the more
  work for you there will be, especially if you are planning a
  game with a lot of combat. Conversely, if you have too few characters
  to start with, then you run a risk of the campaign falling apart
  when you begin to see players fall out of the campaign. Personally,
  I think that 6-8 players is a good number to start the campaign
  with.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">D</FONT></B><FONT
   COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">eciding on which
  players you accept into the campaign can be a very difficult
  decision, especially if you get 20-30 applicants, all desperately
  wanting to be part of the campaign. So as not to have a terribly
  hard time after the closing date, I tend to judge all of the
  applicants as the characters are submitted, dividing the entries
  into 'definitely yes', 'definitely no' and 'maybe'. Hopefully,
  all of your places will come to be filled with 'definitely yes'
  characters alone.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">O</FONT></B><FONT
   COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">nce you have
  made your decision, inform all of the 'winners' that you are
  offering them a place in the game, if they are still interested.
  Get them to confirm to you that they are still interested in
  participating in the game. This is important, as a lot of players
  apply for places in a number of different games, and may already
  have taken a position in another game. If this is the case, it
  is better to find this out before you have told the unsuccessful
  applicants that they have not got a place.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">T</FONT></B><FONT
   COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">hen comes the
  unpleasant job of telling all of those who were not successful
  that this is the case. As unpleasant a task as it is, it should
  be done. Thank everyone for taking the time and trouble to submit
  a character and wish them luck in finding another game to join.
  It is also well worth inviting all of the unsuccessful applicants
  to become lurkers in the campaign, with a promise that the original
  lurkers will get first chance to replace players who fall by
  the wayside.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">A</FONT></B><FONT
   COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">s soon as you
  have selected your players, then you should try to start the
  game as soon as possible, so as not to lose any players who might
  start in other games while they are waiting for your game to
  start. However, even if you follow all of these stages, then
  it is still quite likely that some players will still not bother
  to post at all, or will drop out after just a few days or weeks
  of the game. It is for this reason that it is worth starting
  with more players than you need, and having a number of people
  'lurking' in the campaign. If, however, you do not have enough
  people to keep the campaign going despite taking these precautions,
  then the only solution is to put out another posting for more
  players. If you are just looking for one or two extra players,
  then I would recommend putting the posting up for just a couple
  of days, and giving a closing date of just a few days into the
  future. This should avoid a situation of having to choose between
  30 players in order to fill just one or two places in the campaign.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">I</FONT></B><FONT
   COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">f you follow
  all of the above advice, then the game should now be going and
  everyone involved will hopefully be having a good time. However,you
  still have much to do in order to keep your campaign interesting
  with new encounters. If you have a great amount of imagination,
  then you shouldn't have a great deal of trouble in coming up
  with new and interesting directions for the players to go down.
  One advantage of the slowness of PBeMs compared with face-to-face
  games is that you have plenty of time in order to come up with
  new adventures. If, however, you have trouble in coming up with
  new ideas, there are plenty of ways of getting assistance. One
  way is to buy commercially available adventures. However, if
  you do use this method, then it is usually a good idea to try
  and make a significant number of changes to each adventure, as
  there is always a chance that one or more of your players could
  have read, or even played, the adventure before. Another suggestion
  is to browse the web in search of ideas. There is a great deal
  of material available on the web. However, much of it, unfortunately,
  is not of a very high standard, but if you search for long enough,
  then the chances are that you will find something that sparks
  your imagination, enabling you to fill in the details. In my
  games, I make great use of random encounter generators. These,
  however, should be handled very carefully, as they can very often
  generate encounters that don't fit in with the rest of the campaign.
  If this is the case, then don't be afraid to throw out any encounters
  that you can't justify, and try to think of reasons for the encounter
  to happen and ways in which the encounter can form the start
  of a whole new adventure for the characters.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">S</FONT></B><FONT
   COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">ooner or later,
  you're going to end up with your players being put into a combat
  situation. This can be one of the hardest parts of a PBeM to
  control, as PBeMs are ill-suited for swift combat resolution.
  There are many ways to handle combat. At one extreme, you can
  use the same method as you would use in a face-to-face game,
  with each combat round being played as a round of your campaign.
  While this is the most realistic, even a simple combat can take
  a very long time to run through, and it can get very boring for
  the players, whose only interaction will usually take the form
  of 'I'll strike at the orc with my sword, again' for round after
  round. At the other extreme, you can work through the combat
  yourself in one posting, treating each PC as an NPC for the duration
  of the combat. The downside to this is that players can sometimes
  feel as if they are being left out of one of the most exciting
  parts of the game if they are not allowed any interaction at
  this point. The best thing to do is to ask the players in advance
  as to how they would like to see combat being handled. I tend
  to let the players tell me at the start of the combat sequence
  what their plans will be and then run the combat as far as possible
  until it gets to a point where something that the players did
  not anticipate happens, at which time I ask the players for new
  intentions. I have found that it is best if combat is resolved
  in three postings or less, or else the players start to get a
  little bored.</FONT></P>
  <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+4" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">O</FONT></B><FONT
   COLOR="#ffffff" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light">ne final word
  of advice - combat is not the only part of the game that it is
  worth asking your players for input on. It's usually a good idea
  to check upon how they think the campaign is going every now
  and again, particularly if players start to post less than they
  did at the start of the game. Always remember, you may be the
  DM, but it's not only 'your game'. The game is the responsibility
  of everyone involved. As soon as the game stops being enjoyable
  for either the players or the DM, then that it when the game
  will start to fall apart.</FONT></P>
