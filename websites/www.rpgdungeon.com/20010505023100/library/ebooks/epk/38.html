<P><B>Looking at the mass of treacherous snow, you decide the
way is too dangerous to travel. Slowly you trace your way back
down the mountain. You avoid looking at Hallic's tomb when you
pass. You feel he would not have approved of your choice.<BR>
<BR>
When you arrive home, the people of Aralia stare at you. You greet
a few, but they avoid looking at you and hurry away.<BR>
<BR>
The Council of Elders greets your story with grim silence. Mauric,
the Chief Elder, says in a trembling voice, &quot;Landon, I'm
sure you did your best. We will have totry to find some brave,
strong elves to accompany you and dig out the trail . . . that
is if the storm lets up.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
You look up in surprise and, running to the window, see that snow
has started to fall. The heavy, wet flakes are sticking to the
ground. <BR>
<BR>
Winter has arrived!<BR>
