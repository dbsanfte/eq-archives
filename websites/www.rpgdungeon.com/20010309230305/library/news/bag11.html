<P><CENTER>Even a fantasy world can be a chaotic and terrible
place at times. Few things make sense, and the most improbable
events can happen. Luckily there are great beings that guide mere
mortals through such uncertain times. Those that devote their
lives to such gods are priests. As followers of their deity, they
are expected to spread the word and fight the enemies of their
faith. The chosen few of such devoted followers are called specialty
priests. These figures are blessed with the most powerful of gifts
that their deities have to offer. <BR>
Specialty priests are different from common clerics. They are
the living embodiment of their god, serving as mortal symbols
of everything their deity represents. Typically, ten percent of
any clergy are specialty priests, though in some cases a god may
have no clerics at all, only specialty priests. What makes these
characters so unique among PCs in AD&amp;D(R) worlds are their
special abilities. <BR>
Here is a list of new abilities for constructing specialty priests
under the Player's Option(tm): Skills &amp; Powers rules. Priests
of nearly every mythos can be created with the addition of these
abilities, though DMs are encouraged to add additional powers
to customize the priesthoods of their own campaigns. One of the
most important things to keep in mind when choosing abilities
for a specialty priest is that all powers selected must make sense
together and in relation to the specialty priest's patron deity.
A god of pacifism, for instance, is unlikely to grant the battle
rage power to his followers, despite its obvious benefits to an
adventuring party. Note that the following rules should not be
used for priests of the Dark Sun(R) setting. For information on
using Skills &amp; Powers rules Dark Sun PCs, see &quot;Heroes
of Athas&quot; in the 1996 Dragon(R) Magazine Annual. <BR>
Specialty priest abilities<BR>
Like a cleric, a specialty priest receives 125 character points
to spend on skills and abilities from the Player's Option: Spells
&amp; Powers book and the list presented here. See Table 1 for
a combined list of the abilities available to specialty priests.
<BR>
&middot; Backstab (15): Priests of murder can learn to strike
foes from behind, as does a thief. If a priest attacks from the
back with surprise, he receives +4 to hit and inflicts damage
as if he were a thief of the same level. The priest may not wear
armor heavier than chain mail while backstabbing and can do so
with any one handed melee weapon allowed to him. <BR>
&middot; Battle rage (15): Some priests of war can inspire their
companions to fight more fiercely. A priest with such an ability
can grant a +2 to hit and damage to all allies in a 608 radius.
The priest may perform no other action during this time, and the
ability takes one round to invoke. The bonus lasts for two rounds
per level of the priest and can be used once per day. Note, this
bonus is not cumulative with the bless, chant, or prayer spells.
<BR>
&middot; Calming aura (20): Priests with this ability can remove
fear with their touch as per spell. By their mere presence, these
priests can alter the moods of those around them, causing all
hostile creatures within 158 to make a successful saving throw
vs. spells each round or become non hostile. Undead are immune
to this effect. This power does not function if the priest himself
is performing hostile actions. Both aspects of this power function
continuously, as long as the priest is conscious. <BR>
&middot; Cure/cause disease (15): This is identical to the paladin
ability and may be performed once a week per every five levels.
Evil priests use the reverse of this ability. <BR>
&middot; Dead zone/wild zone immunity (15): The priest's spells
can never go wild nor be affected by dead magic zones. This power
does not allow a priest to cast spells if he is somehow cut off
from his god, however. <BR>
&middot; Divine recognition (15): A priest with this power can
identify the name and history of an object, person, or event relevant
to his field of worship. For every level up to 5th, the priest's
chance are 10% per level. From 6th to 10th, an addition 5% per
level is added, and from 11th level on, an extra 3% per level
is added. This power may be used as often as the priest wishes,
but it requires a full round. Only one attempt may be made per
target, however. Once the priest gains a level, he may make another
attempt on a target if he failed the first time. A priest of war,
for example, could identify the number and training of an opposing
army within his sight. A priest who worships art can determine
the value of a painting and the talent of the artist. Magic-worshiping
priests can identify an item's general function. A priest of truth/justice
can tell if a person is lying or cheating. <BR>
&middot; Elemental immunity (20): This power enables the priest
to be unaffected by natural forms of a certain element for one
round per level of the priest per day. Such elements could be
fire, lightning, cold, or acid. This ability also grants automatic
saves against the magical versions of these elements. If no save
is allowed against these magical versions, this power has no effect.
<BR>
&middot; Gift of life (25): At fifth level, a priest with this
power may resurrect an individual who has died not later than
a round ago. The resurrection attempt, if successfully survived,
bestows full hit points, and the revived character does not lose
a point of Constitution. (The resurrection still counts against
the number of times that the character may be resurrected.) Such
a gift is not without its price: The priest permanently loses
one hit point each time this power is used. <BR>
&middot; Hide in shadows (5/10): The specialty priest can hide
in shadows, as the ranger ability, in natural surroundings. See
Table 22 in the ranger section of Skills &amp; Powers for the
chance of success. With the 10-point option, the priest can hide
in shadows even in an urban environment. <BR>
&middot; Immunities (5/15): Priests with this ability are especially
resistant to damage from a single sphere of magic (invocation,
necromantic, etc.) The 5-point ability grants a +2 to any saving
throw, if allowed, where the 15-point ability bestows automatic
saving throw success. <BR>
&middot; Inspire fear (10): Priests who worship death can inspire
fear in others. For every two levels, a priest with this ability
can cast the fear spell once a day. <BR>
&middot; Languages (10): Any priest of trade or travel will more
than likely have to learn many languages. This ability allows
a priest to gain one additional proficiency per level after third,
to be spent on languages only. The priest must still take the
time to learn them as any other language. <BR>
&middot; Lay on hands (10): Just as a paladin, a good or neutral
priest may heal two hp on himself or another creature once per
day. An evil priest with this ability can inflict two hp damage
per level once per day with the touch of his hands. There is no
save against the draining effect. <BR>
&middot; Move Silently (5/10): The specialty priest can move silently,
as the ranger ability, in natural surroundings. See Table 22 in
the ranger section of Skills &amp; Powers for the chance of success.
With the 10-point option, the priest can hide in shadows even
in an urban environment. <BR>
&middot; Turn lycanthrope (10): Few priests are granted this ability.
It allows a priest to turn any werebeast, whether natural or cursed,
if they are in their non human form at the beast's hit dice. For
the result, the werecreature is knocked unconscious for 16 turns.
Like turning undead, this power is less effective in Ravenloft(R)
setting campaigns. <BR>
&middot; Turn undead (10/15): The priest is granted power over
undead, such as zombies, skeletons, vampires, and liches. Priests
can drive away these creatures, and as priests advance in faith
and experience levels, they can destroy some forms of undead.
The 15-point ability is for priests with a greater understanding
of undead, such as death priests have. They can turn undead as
if they were three levels higher. See the turning undead table
in the Player's Option: Skills &amp; Powers rulebook. <BR>
&middot; Ultra vision (10): Any priest who worships a god of light,
darkness, or insight may be granted ultra vision. This special
sight allows the devoted follower to see in darkness as if it
were day. Note, unlike ultra violet vision, ultra vision allows
sight even deep underground, but this power does not penetrate
magical darkness. <BR>
Optional restrictions<BR>
Specialty priests can gain bonus character points to spend on
the above abilities by accepting voluntary restrictions to their
abilities. <BR>
&middot; Codes of ethics (5 per code up to 20): Some gods impose
certain restrictions upon their followers. Some restrictions may
include not being able to marry, not being allowed to fight members
of the opposite sex (this one may not be taken if the PC already
a pacifist), not being able to consume certain common foods like
meat or alcohol, having to keep one's head shaved or to wear certain
strange dress, or not being able to speak after sundown, except
to cast spells. <BR>
&middot; Limited armor (5/10/15): #A priest with this restriction
has more limited armor selection than normal. Being limited to
chain mail or lighter gives the priest 5 CPs, where studded leather
or lighter, gives him 10 CPs. No armor at all is worth 15 CPs.
If the priest can't use a shield, it is worth an additional 5
CPs. <BR>
&middot; Limited magical item use (5+): #Some deities deny the
use of some magic items to their priests. For each category that
is barred, the priest gains 5 CPs. The categories are: potions
and oils; scrolls; rings and other miscellaneous items; rods,
staves, and wands; and weapons and armor. <BR>
&middot; Pacifist (15): A pacifist may never strike a blow against
any intelligent creature or risk angering his god. Such a priest
is not always against others who use violence; he simply chooses
not to take that route himself. <BR>
&middot; Self-reliant (20): Some gods favor self reliance among
their worshippers. Such gods grant their priests only half the
normal spells, rounding up. <BR>
&middot; Vow of poverty (10): The priest must only possess what
money that he needs to survive. Such priests may never own magical
items unless they are plain looking, and they must donate all
treasure and excess wealth to a worthy, nonplayer character cause.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Here is a system to quantify a character's piety, or
the amount of divine favor that PC or NPC enjoys as a result of
his behavior. Through obeying the teachings of the faith, upholding
its beliefs, and working to increase its power, PCs of any class
can gain the support and approval of their gods. DMs will have
a new tool to encourage role-playing, and players will have a
clear set of guidelines and goals. <BR>
Throughout this article, a character's &quot;faith&quot; is the
religion he belongs to, the god he worships, the philosophy he
espouses, or the natural forces he represents (i.e., the force
of Good or Chaos). A &quot;servant&quot; is a cleric, paladin,
priest, monk, lay brother, or other character who is part of the
clergy or one of the immediate servants of the faith. A &quot;follower&quot;
is any other class (or zero-level) who is a member of the faith.
Despite their ability to cast priest spells, rangers are followers,
not servants. <BR>
Effects of piety<BR>
A character's piety is measured by piety points, which are gained
through pious acts and lost through impiety. The PC's current
number of piety points determine his piety level. As with experience
levels, increased piety brings more benefits that &quot;kick in&quot;
at discrete intervals. Unlike experience, however, it is easy
to lose piety and drop a level. The listed piety points (PP) are
the minimum necessary to enter the corresponding category. All
followers of a faith begin play with 1 point of piety in their
given faith. All servants (priests and paladins) begin with 1d4
PP. <BR>
At higher levels of piety, all followers and servants gain with
special powers or advantages as a sign of divine favor and as
further weapons in the fight against the enemies of the faith.
All benefits of piety are cumulative. The character's effective
power level with any granted ability is the same as that of a
paladin of the same experience level. Example: A pious follower
of Oghma (a 12th-level bard) has been given the major ability
to turn undead. When he does, he has the same chance as a paladin
of the same level, who can turn as a 10th-level cleric. Piety
level in the campaign <BR>
A character's piety represents the protective &quot;aura&quot;
placed around him by his faith. This aura is usually invisible,
but it may be detected by the appropriate spells. All extraplanar
servants of the character's faith automatically know his current
piety level, and all extraplanar servants of other faiths can
detect his piety level by making a successful Wisdom check. Extremely
pious characters (piety IV or higher) may, at the DM's option,
become noticeable to the casual observer. The nature of their
aura will generally reflect the character's faith. For example,
a follower of a good-aligned faith may radiate a feeling of peace
and goodwill, while a servant of evil may radiate a sense of chilling
unease. <BR>
Gaining and Losing Piety<BR>
Characters receive piety-point gains or losses at the same time
they receive experience points, when the events of the adventure
are still fresh in the DM's mind. Since different faiths have
different demands, the DM will use a specific set of guidelines
for each faith (see Designing the Faith, below). To calculate
piety awards, simply add all applicable awards and penalties to
determine one number, to a maximum of +1 to +4 points per game
session (although any number of points can be lost during an adventure,
there should be a strict limit on how many can be gained). Note
that one act could have many consequences. For example, robbing
a poor box is both &quot;theft from a church,&quot; and &quot;harming
the weak&quot;).<BR>
Canny players will plan their actions so as to minimize piety
losses and maximize gains (killing only in a good cause, doing
a few extra good deeds to make up for a lapse, etc.). <BR>
Add all awards to the player's current total, and apply all results
immediately. Transition from one level to another is a major event
in a character's life, of course, and DM's may wish to throw in
some sort of sign or omen (a pleasant or disturbing dream, an
unusual bit of weather, etc.). If the total piety points are reduced
below 0, the character's piety remains at 0, and a divine curse
is placed on the character as a warning (see Table 6). A character
at 0 piety who commits a further offense earns a further curse
for every three such offenses (rounded down). <BR>
Duration of curses: If this is the first time for the character,
a good or tolerant faith may let him off with a warning, and the
curse will only last one day. Otherwise, all curses are permanent
until the character has atoned for his deeds. Although a character
may earn enough piety to go above 0, all curses remain until the
offense that triggered each one is atoned for separately. <BR>
Designing the faith<BR>
Although all faiths have much the same categories of awards and
penalties, each faith will have specific behaviors that earn each
one. For example, although all faiths require some sort of regular
ceremonial observance, the exact nature of the observance can
vary widely, from some private meditation to wild festivals. Although
the DM can determine the specific actions that will earn each
award or penalty for all the common religions in his campaign
world, it will certainly lessen his workload (and heighten player
interest), if the PC collaborates in the design of his faith.
Of course, the DM has the final say in all such decisions. <BR>
Awards and Penalties<BR>
For each award, the corresponding penalty for doing the opposite
is given.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>All followers and servants <BR>
1. Following minimal standard of behavior. A minimum standard
of behavior (attending occasional services, giving spare change
to the church, not spitting on the shrine, etc.) is neither very
interesting to roleplay nor the sort of heroic sacrifice that
really inspires the deities who watch over the campaign world.
PCs do not have to roleplay any of these minimums, but don't get
anything for them, either: No change to piety. Failure to uphold
minimum standards, mocking faith, or seizing chance to break a
minor observance (e.g., drinking on a day of abstinence): 1 piety.
<BR>
2. Attending major religious event: +1 piety. Major events, such
as festivals, mysteries, or observances, occur about 36 times
a year. Each one should occupy most or all of a day, and involve
some sort of expense (either a sacrifice, a gift, or &quot;I simply
must buy a new robe for Year Day!&quot;), from 1100 gp. Neglecting
to attend a major event for any reason: 1 piety. <BR>
3. Tithes a percentage of all income: +1 piety (10% tithe), +2
piety (50%), +3 piety 90%). This is the same as the paladin requirement
(paladins get no extra piety for a 10% tithe). A &quot;tithe&quot;
is a percentage of income donated to NPC clergy; it may not otherwise
benefit any PC in any way. The percentage of income that a given
faith requires is entirely up to the DM (tithe 10%, +1 piety;
50%, +2 piety; 90%, +3 piety). Fails to make required tithe: 1
piety <BR>
4. Constructs a small shrine: +1 piety. Specific requirements
must be determined by the DM, but may include building the structure
alone and by hand, spending 100 gp or more, consecration of the
site by a servant of the faith, or placing the shrine in a specific
location (such as beside a bridge, or in a forest). Players may
not gain piety for constructing more than one small shrine per
game month. Harms small shrine of own faith: 2 piety. <BR>
5. Constructs a temple: +4 piety. This may be a church, a monastery,
a school run by monks, or even a hospital (like those run by the
Knights Hospitaller during the Crusades). Temples must be well-constructed
(of average or better quality), and have a central meeting area,
one or more altars, and smaller rooms sufficient for the temple's
purposes. PCs are entirely responsible for either constructing
or funding the temple (see The Castle Guide for costs, or roll
randomly 10d10 1,000 gp), and finding a staff for it. Constructing
a temple is a major campaign event, and the DM may wish to build
one or more adventures around it. Note that strongholds that higher-level
characters build in order to attract followers do not count. Harms
temple of own faith: __10 piety <BR>
6. Martyrdom: +10 piety. This is dying a conspicuously heroic
death at the hands of an enemy of the faith while fighting for
one's own faith. At the DM's option, players who were well aware
that a member of the party had raise dead memorized do not qualify
for this award. Betrayal of a holy cause to the enemy in order
to save one's own life: 10 piety. <BR>
7. Aiding servant of own faith: +1 piety. Assists an NPC servant
in their duties or quests, without thought of reward. Harms servant
of own faith (double penalty of servant who is killed; halve current
piety if servant has zero piety): 2 piety per Hit Die of servant.
<BR>
8. 8. Harming or impeding a member of enemy faith: +1 piety. An
&quot;enemy faith&quot; isn't just a faith that isn't an ally
it's a faith that is actively opposed to yours, and whose servants
work to harm yours. Highly intolerant faiths regard all other
faiths as &quot;enemy.&quot; Aids member of enemy faith (halve
if member of enemy faith has zero piety): 2 piety.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Priests &amp; Paladins <BR>
1. Carry out any of the above duties. All servants are expected
to perform all eight duties above and receive the same amount
of piety as a follower would. Committing any of the above offenses:
double the piety loss. <BR>
2. Carrying out additional basic duties of servants: +0. This
includes performing ceremonies, giving advice and spiritual guidance,
casting spells to aid followers, obeying all class restrictions,
and so on. Again, it is assumed that PCs are doing this unless
they say otherwise, and each duty does not have to be &quot;gamed
out&quot; in detail. Neglecting basic duty (each day or fraction
of a day): 2 piety</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>All followers and servants of specific faiths <BR>
In addition to common behaviors listed above, each faith has unique
awards and penalties. For each faith, find the portfolio or portfolios
below describing that faith, and add the listed awards and penalties
to the character's requirements. (More complete descriptions of
these portfolios can be found in The Complete Priest's Handbook.)
For example, Selune (of the Forgotten Realms(R) setting) is the
deity of both the Moon and of a specific craft (navigation). DMs
should use these listings as guidelines, adding new entries or
modifying the existing ones to reflect the portfolios of the deities
in their campaigns. Many deities and some forces also have an
alignment. Any such faiths also demand either good, neutral, or
evil behavior from their followers and servants. For such faiths,
add the appropriate alignment behaviors from the list below. For
example, besides being concerned with the stars and navigation,
Selune is also chaotic good. All followers and servants of Selune
can also gain piety by good acts (or lose it by non-good acts)
but these awards and penalties are given out only 50% of the time
(see &quot;Chaos,&quot; below).</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>The following entries contain a mixture of specific
awards and rules notes.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Agriculture <BR>
Wilfully harming crops or pasture__land: __1 piety. <BR>
Ancestors <BR>
A &quot;shrine&quot; includes any permanent grave-marking or tombstone.
<BR>
Animals, Nature. <BR>

+1 piety. Harming animals or plants unnecessarily: __1 piety.
<BR>
Arts (Includes writing, painting, calligraphy, or even music and
singing.) <BR>
Spending more than one NWP in a particular art: +1 piety. Donating
large amounts of money to fund the art: +1 piety. Harming an unflawed
work of the specific art: __1 piety. <BR>
Balance, Neutrality<BR>
Faiths of True Neutrality regard both paladins and assassins as
&quot;enemies of the faith&quot; 50% of the time. Opposing imbalance
of relevant dimension (either law__ chaos, or good__evil): +0
piety. Aggravates existing imbalance: __1 piety. <BR>
Birth, Children <BR>
Giving birth to or caring for child: +1 piety/year. Harm a mother
or child: __5 piety. <BR>
Chaos <BR>
Faiths that are strongly chaotic will notice and reward (or punish)
any particular behavior only 50% of the time. <BR>
Community <BR>
The deity of a particular community or city will regard all citizens
of that community as &quot;followers of an allied faith&quot;
and any traitors as &quot;enemies of the faith.&quot; Suffer serious
wound or die in defense of the city: +5 piety. <BR>
Crafts (Includes any secondary skill or nonweapon proficiency
that isn't an artistic one.) <BR>
A large guild-hall devoted to the teaching of the craft counts
as a &quot;temple.&quot; Spend an extra NWP in the specific craft:
+1 piety. Cause a technique to be lost or forgotten (for example,
by killing the only master craftsman who knows it): __4 piety.
<BR>
Dawn, Beginnings <BR>
Begin a major enterprise (any task whose outcome is uncertain
and which would take one or more adventures to complete): +2 piety.

<P><CENTER>Optional systems<BR>
The conversion Either through misfortune or misplay, the character
has found himself with no piety and one or more divine curses.
Clearly, the player chose the wrong starting faith, and would
be happier with a faith closer to his own playing style. <BR>
In such circumstances, many characters (and some PCs) may opt
to convert to a new faith which is more in line with his own beliefs
and actions. <BR>
Procedure: The character must seek out a clergy (or, at the DM's
option, a holy place) of the desired faith, and humbly petition
the deity or force, through prayer, fasting, and ceremony, for
protection and guidance. This petition is usually granted, as
most powers are always on the lookout for new recruits. The character
will have all previous piety points, effects and curses (and granted
abilities) erased, and receives a new piety of 1 point, in the
new faith. <BR>
If the new faith allows the previous character class, the character
may continue in his current class, but with a 50% penalty to all
earned XP until he has risen one experience level (this duplicates
the effect of changing alignments). If the new faith does not
permit the previous class (for example, a paladin converting to
an evil faith), then the character becomes the &quot;base&quot;
character class (a paladin becomes a fighter, an assassin becomes
a thief, etc.), minus one level of experience, and suffers the
50% penalty to earned experience points until he has risen two
experience levels. Player characters may never convert more than
once in their lives. Nonplayer characters convert only at the
DM's option, as the result of massive effort on the PC's part,
involving several weeks of debate, conversation, demonstrations
of the faith's power, persuading the NPC of the rightness of the
associated behaviors, and so on. At the end of that time, the
DM may secretly allow the NPC a save vs. spells. If this is failed,
the NPC has converted and the relevant PCs receive +1 piety points
apiece, minus whatever they lost by coercing the NPC, etc. Of
course, a clever NPC may pretend to be converted.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Divine intervention <BR>
At the DM's option, characters may attempt to gain divine intervention
by appealing directly to their faith. <BR>
Procedure: the PC (or NPC) spends one action to make the appeal,
and rolls a d20. If the roll is less than the character's current
piety point total, the appeal is successful, and the character
receives divine aid. The aid will be useful, but never more than
the minimum necessary to solve an immediate problem. Attackers
may be distracted long enough for the character to win an initiative
die roll, a poison dart will be coated with a weaker poison than
usual, the character will notice a secret door he missed before,
and so on. Deities dislike being called on at random intervals,
so all such appeals (successful or not) will cost the player 1d10
piety points. Note that enemy NPCs can roll for divine intervention,
too.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>The pantheon <BR>
One type of faith is the pantheon __ a faith built around a group
of gods. Followers and servants of this faith must obey and follow
the dictates of all of the members of the pantheon, but tend to
focus on one particular part. At the DM's option, characters may
select a group of allied or related gods to form the core of their
faith, and one member of that group to be their &quot;primary&quot;
deity. The grouping may or may not have any formal relationship,
or might just happen to be the four or five deities that the character
likes the most. Throughout the campaign, the character receives
full piety awards and penalties from his primary deity, but only
50% (rounded down) of applicable rewards and penalties from the
other deities of his pantheon (thus, he will have to earn at least
two piety points from a secondary deity to get any piety). <BR>
In addition, all spells and other granted powers are assumed to
come from the primary deity (for the purposes of allowed access
to spheres and so on).<BR>
The skeptic <BR>
At the DM's option, players who do not wish to participate in
the piety system are skeptics __ characters who have the requisite
strength of will (or sheer rebelliousness) to deny the power of
a local deity, force, or philosophy. Skeptics never gain or lose
piety. However, the force of a skeptic's disbelief is such that
any beneficial clerical magic directed at him has a 20% chance
of failing. The deity does not wish to aid such a skeptic, and
any further attempts to cast beneficial clerical magic will automatically
fail for the remainder of the day. For obvious reasons, a skeptic
can never be a cleric or paladin.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Proficiency notes<BR>
Religion: In addition to its other uses, the Religion NWP automatically
gives knowledge of all spiritual guidelines (a theoretical list
of commandments and prohibitions and associated piety gains and
losses) for the owner's faith. A successful NWP check gives the
same information for other common faiths in the area. <BR>
NPC clergy spend a lot of their time using this NWP to give guidance
to their flock. However, such guidance is only the owner's &quot;best
guess&quot;, and may or may not be the actual intent of the deity.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Spell notes<BR>
In general, any spell that specifically affects &quot;evil&quot;
creatures (such as protection from evil, detect evil, or holy
word) will function on characters of an evil faith only if their
Piety Level is II (&quot;devoted&quot;) or higher __ in other
words,if they are strongly evil. <BR>
The reverse is also true. Reversed spells of this nature affect
good characters only if they are strongly good (good-aligned followers
or servants with a piety of Level II or higher). <BR>
For the purposes of the following, any offense that causes a loss
of 4 or more piety points is a &quot;major offense,&quot; while
any offense that causes losses of from one to three points are
&quot;minor&quot; offenses.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Animate Dead: <BR>
Any good magic__user who employs this spell loses 1d10 piety points
immediately. Any good cleric or <BR>
paladin loses 2d10 points. Neutral magic__users lose 1d6 points,
and neutral clerics or paladins lose 1d10. <BR>
Atonement: <BR>
If the character is truly repentant (DM's discretion), this spell
will replace the piety points lost as the result of one minor
offense. If the loss had triggered a divine curse, the curse may
now be removed by a cleric (but not a magic__user). Major offenses
cannot be redeemed by this spell (see Quest). <BR>
Augury: <BR>
Instead of warning of physical danger, an augury may be cast to
warn of &quot;spiritual&quot; danger__in other words, whether
the character's piety will be raised or lowered if the proposed
action is carried out.<BR>
Commune: <BR>
Can also be used to determine possible gains or losses in piety
from contemplated actions. As in the Player's Handbook spell description,
commune can be used to discover a way to achieve a goal while
minimizing danger__in this case, danger to one's piety (e.g.,
&quot;Don't kill the guard. Offer him a job!&quot;). <BR>
Dispel Magic: <BR>
The magical effects of a divine curse or granted ability on their
recipient may not be dispelled. <BR>
Divination: <BR>
In addition to it's other effects, a divination may be used for
spiritual advice. This advice will contain clues as to the best
way to avoid losses of piety points as a result of the cleric's
intended actions. Note that &quot;Stay home!&quot; is often a
good piece of advice. <BR>
Limited wish: <BR>
Can be used to restore the piety lost by one minor offense, or
to counteract the effects of a divine curse for 1d6 turns. <BR>
Quest: <BR>
If the target accepts and carries out the quest, a major past
offense against the granting faith will be forgiven, and the resulting
piety loss restored. If this loss had triggered a divine curse,
that curse may now be removed. <BR>
Raise dead: <BR>
If the target died with at least one divine curse, his resurrection
chance is rolled with a 10% penalty. A strongly pious character
(II or higher), on the other hand, gains a 10% bonus to his resurrection
check. <BR>
Reincarnation: <BR>
If the target died with at least one divine curse, the new incarnation
will be the least desirable one (e.g., a kobold, if the target
used to be an elf, or a stag, if the target was a hunter), and
may, at the DM's option, also suffer an additional curse from
table 6. A strongly pious target (piety level II or higher) may
roll twice on the reincarnation table, and take the best result.
<BR>
Remove curse: <BR>
A divine curse (see Table 3) may not be removed by a wizard. A
cleric of 16th level or higher will be able to remove the curse,
as part of the character's conversion (see above) to that cleric's
faith, or if the character had previously atoned (see atonement
or quest, above) for the crime that triggered the curse. Any other
attempt to remove the curse by magical means will fail. <BR>
Resurrection: <BR>
If the target died with at least one divine curse, his resurrection
chance is rolled with a 20% penalty. A strongly pious character
(II or higher), on the other hand, gains a 20% bonus to his resurrection
check. <BR>
True seeing: <BR>
The clerical version of this spell will reveal the approximate
level of the target's piety (within one level), and the alignment
of the target's faith. This replaces the &quot;detect alignment&quot;
portion of the Player's Handbook spell description. The wizard
version of the spell does not reveal any piety information. <BR>
Wish:<BR>
Can be used to restore the piety lost by one major offense, to
raise the piety of the character by one point, or to counteract
the effects of a divine curse for 1d6 hours.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Skills &amp; Powers conversions<BR>
The Player's Option(tm): Skills &amp; Powers rulebook offers another
system for tracking the effects of a servant's faith __ conditional
priests, whose spellcasting depends on how well their actions
are currently serving their religion. While &quot;piety&quot;
changes slowly over the course of a campaign, &quot;conditionals&quot;
can fluctuate rapidly, shifting many times in the course of a
single adventure or even a single encounter. <BR>
DMs can use the listed piety awards to help create conditionals
or allow servants (only) to use both concepts, tracking a servant's
long-term behavior as well as his immediate actions. If so, each
level of piety above I (average) counts as a +1 conditional modifier
and each divine curse counts as a 1 penalty. The effects of piety
and of conditionals are cumulative, except that no servant ever
receives the +2 level bonus for being &quot;devoted.&quot; Note
that the same action can lead to immediate conditional modifiers
as well as long-term piety changes.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>The Masque of the Red Death rules contain kit descriptions
for three basic kinds of religious professionals. First are the
very ordinary parsons, members of the tradesman class who derive
great strength of will from their faith in an established world
religion. These characters are described as being &quot;among
the greatest enemies of the Red Death,&quot; moved by their strong
faith to fight against the power of evil in the world. Next are
the shamans, leaders in the tribal religions of Africa, Australia,
and the natives of North and South America. As mystics, these
characters live in constant awareness of the world of the spirits,
and derive magical power from that awareness. Third are the spiritualists
and mediums, also mystic characters, who practice spiritualism
and communication with the spirits of the dead. While spiritualism
is a major part of religion in Gothic Earth, it is by no means
the only manifestation of religious belief. Nor can the varieties
of religious expression be summed up in the parson and shaman
kits. In fact, there are certain other religious figures with
mystical powers. The kits described in this article, following
the same format as those in A Guide to Gothic Earth, broadening
the field for clerical characters in the Masque of the Red Death
setting. <BR>
Exorcist characters have studied vast amounts of lore concerning
evil spirits and techniques of commanding and dispelling them,
while Enthusiasts practice what is called &quot;faith healing.&quot;
Characters of both kits are generally members of world religions,
like parsons, but like spiritualists and shamans they are members
of the mystic class.</CENTER></P>

<P>Description: Exorcists are religious specialists who are trained
and empowered to banish evil spirits. Unlike most religious figures
on Gothic Earth, exorcists do have spiritual powers (mystic spells)
to help them in their spiritual warfare against evil. Through
elaborate rites that may include dancing, drumming, beating a
possessed person on the soles of the feet, liberal use of holy
water, or many other means, the exorcist hopes to drive away the
spiritual forces of the Red Death, preventing them from causing
harm to the bodies and souls of humanity. Specific creatures that
exorcists are particularly effective in combatting include ghosts,
haunts, odems, carrionettes, ghostlights, even fiends (in some
campaigns), as well as other monsters capable of dominating or
possessing their victims. They also have heightened powers against
all forms of undead. <BR>
<BR>
Roleplaying: Exorcists are serious about their work and very devoted
to their religion. Not all of them are dour and grim, but most
are. Their determination to combat the forces of evil in the world
__ along with their special abilities to do so __ more than makes
up for their lack of humor. Generally, exorcists have completed
many years of training to learn their skills and perfect their
devotion. Most exorcists should be at least middle-aged.<BR>
Special benefits: Exorcists turn undead as if they were 1 level
higher than their actual level. Since Exorcists derive their mystical
powers from a source of good, they are less likely to attract
the attention of the Red Death with their spellcasting. In most
cases, the chance of failing a powers check is half what it would
normally be __ i.e., one-half the spell's level (round up) or,
in the case of a spell from the Necromantic sphere, the spell's
level. The exception to this rule is described under special hindrances,
below. <BR>
Special hindrances: The next sphere learned by an exorcist after
mastering or abandoning the sphere of All must be Protection.
Exorcists must be Lawful Good. As mentioned above, Exorcists are
not as susceptible as most characters to the evil influence of
the Red Death in their spellcasting. However, if an Exorcist does
betray his or her faith by using a spell for evil purposes, the
chance of failing the powers check is twice what it would normally
be __ double the spell's level, or quadruple the level of a Necromantic
spell. Similarly, if an Exorcist is ever required to make a powers
check because of an evil act such as theft or murder, the chance
of failure is doubled.</P>

<P>Description: Enthusiasts are preachers first and foremost,
powerful and persuasive speakers who are also capable of working
miracles of healing as a result of their faith. They are often
important opponents of the Red Death, fighting the forces of evil
through their healing powers. Enthusiasts have a special interest
in battling minions of the Red Death that feed on the life-force
of their human victims, such as vampires and other level-draining
undead, midnight cats, kizoku, simpathetics, and the like. <BR>
Roleplaying: Enthusiasts are strongly committed to their faith.
They may be missionaries, traveling revivalists, or local preachers,
but in any case their lives are dedicated to their religion. They
rarely miss an opportunity to talk to others about it, and often
use their healing powers to impress others with the power of faith,
hoping to win converts by that means. Note that, unlike exorcists,
enthusiasts are as susceptible as other spellcasters to the powers
of the Red Death. <BR>
<BR>
Special benefits: The enthusiast begins with minor access to the
All and Healing spheres. When addressing a group of humans who
are not predominantly scientists or other persons steeped in the
worldview of modern science (see special hindrances, below), the
enthusiast can attempt to influence the mood of the crowd. This
is handled exactly as a bard's Influence Reactions ability. <BR>
Special hindrances: The enthusiast can never gain major access
to the All sphere. Scientists and other persons steeped in a &quot;modernist&quot;
worldview (including spiritualists and metaphysicians) look down
on the enthusiast's fervent religious faith; in dealing with such
characters, the enthusiast receives a 2 reaction penalty. Science
is always trying to prove that the &quot;miracles&quot; (spell
ability) of the enthusiast are in fact parlor tricks or elaborate
hoaxes.</P>

<P><CENTER>Priestly proficiencies<BR>
The four new nonweapon proficiencies described below are especially
appropriate for mystic characters belonging to one of the kits
described above, as well as mystics using the kits in A Guide
to Gothic Earth. They belong to the Arcane group and can be learned
by any character with access to that group. They can also be easily
adapted to almost any other AD&amp;D(R) campaign. <BR>
Hierarchy contact. Characters with positions in established church
hierarchies or other organized religions may have access to resources
unavailable to other characters. This proficiency reflects such
resources, and indicates that the character knows how to work
within his or her hierarchy to get information and other supplies
an adventuring party may need. In Bram Stoker's Dracula, Abraham
Van Helsing uses holy wafers in a putty to seal the tomb of Lucy
Westenra. He could do this because, as he says, &quot;I have an
Indulgence.&quot; (Of course, A Gothic Earth Gazetteer notes that
Van Helsing is &quot;a very close friend&quot;of Pope Leo XIII.
No such close relationship is implied in this proficiency!) <BR>
This proficiency may be used to gather information about a specific
place, person, or object. This use of the proficiency is much
like consulting a sage, as described in the Dungeon Master(R)
Guide. No proficiency check is required for the character, just
a normal success roll for the &quot;sage.&quot; Monetary resources
are not required, but the character must have access to modern
means of communication __either telegraph or mail systems. Especially
in the latter case, information can be significantly delayed in
transit. The fields of study to which the character's contact
has access are somewhat limited, at the DM's discretion. <BR>
A successful proficiency check gives the character access to consecrated
or otherwise special items which may be useful in battling the
supernatural. This use of the proficiency is entirely at the DM's
discretion, but may provide holy water, blessed weapons, holy
wafers or their equivalent, or other such items.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Meditation.<BR>
Most religious professionals are trained in various practices
of spiritual discipline and meditation. In addition to the effects
that these practices have upon the soul of the meditator, they
have more concrete physical and mental effects as well. By spending
time in meditation and prayer and making a successful proficiency
check, the character can temporarily boost one mental ability
score __ Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma __ by +2. The effect
lasts one-third of the time spent in meditation, so if the character
spent three uninterrupted hours in meditation, the ability score
would remain heightened for one hour. Meditation requires freedom
from disturbance, and does not eliminate the needs for food, drink,
or sleep. Only one ability can be boosted at any given time. (Note:
This proficiency is derived from the special ability of the mystic
kit in the Player's Option(tm): Skills &amp; Powers' book.)</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Movement meditation.<BR>
Certain mystical traditions in Gothic Earth, particularly (but
not exclusively) in the East, emphasize physical discipline and
exercise as means of spiritual growth. This proficiency is identical
to the Meditation proficiency described above, except that one
physical ability __ Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution __ can
be improved by +1 for a period equal to half the time spent in
meditation.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Presence.<BR>
Some characters have such spiritual power that their auras are
almost tangible, easily detected by others and, particularly,
by supernatural creatures. On a successful proficiency check,
the character can shift the reaction of a supernatural creature
by one level towards the low end of the chart __ so that a hostile
result becomes threatening, a threatening result becomes cautious,
and a cautious result becomes friendly or flight. James Wyatt</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Duke Kort Adler of Wierech stood facing west. Even
five hundred feet up, at the top of his tower, he could see distinctly
the different armies below him. The bitter cold of the Gorgon's
sorcerous wind ripped through him, but he could not abandon his
post. His family, holed up in the same tower, was as safe as he
could make it. <BR>
That is to say, not at all. <BR>
The tower shuddered. The undead had breached the outer wall before
daybreak, and giant beasts brought battering rams and siege engines
to assault. Those of his loyal knights who still survived tried
to repulse them from the lower parapets, but to no avail. No matter
how many they killed, the Gorgon's forces still came on. Now,
they fought the Urga-Zai, and they died. The tower shuddered again.
A giant stone fell from the wall near the Duke. Grimly, he smiled.
It could not help but crush a half-dozen goblins or orogs when
it landed. Perhaps, he thought, it might destroy one of the giants
working the ram. A small victory, but that was all the Duke of
Wierech had left. <BR>
More stones fell. The cries of the goblins and the screams of
prisoners carried up to the Duke's ears. He knew the Gorgon's
sorceries brought the screams to this height, but that did not
make them less real. The Duke knew his pride had brought this
upon him. He only hoped that his youngest son, sent to the coast
only a week before, had made it out of the Gorgon's clutches.
Otherwise, the realm of Wierech would fall with him. <BR>
As if his thoughts were a catalyst, the tower shook one more time
and began to sway. The Duke gripped the walls, but knew the outcome.
He cursed the Gorgon as he fell, and his great tower toppled into
a flaming ruin amid the icy stone. <BR>
The Fortress of Adlersburg had fallen. <BR>
<BR>
Set between the mountains of Wierech, the Fortress of Adlersburg
once watched over the Gorgon's Crown, one of the most evil realms
on Cerilia. Its architect, the Duke of Wierech, hoped to contain
the evil of the Gorgon and prevent it from infecting his realm.
But his proud fortress only goaded the immortal awnshegh into
testing, and then destroying, his would-be watcher. The fall of
Adlersburg presaged one of the greatest debacles in the history
of Brechtr. Many of the realms of the Western Reaches have yet
to fully recover from the Gorgon's &quot;lesson&quot; to the proud
Duke. <BR>
Today, Adlersburg is a haunted ruin. In the weeks after the death
of Duke Kort Adler and the slaughter of his armies, the Gorgon
over-ran Wierech and most of the neighboring realms of the region.
Only the timely intervention of Mden, Danigau, and some remaining
Anuirean forces kept him from conquering a large portion of the
Western Reaches entirely. As it was, the Brechts and their allies
paid a great price to drive the Gorgon's forces entirely from
Wierech, and the Ruin of Adlersburg has never been completely
free of evil. <BR>
The haunting of Adlersburg Many evils still haunt the Ruin of
Adlersburg, but the sting to ancient pride is the worst. Ever
since the great Fortress fell to the Gorgon's armies, the ruler
of Adlersburg (a Duchess or Duke descended from the architect
of the Fortress) has not been able to build or maintain a decent
army or castle in the region. Wierech's morale, as a military
nation, still suffers from the humiliating defeat __ and, perhaps,
a curse. <BR>
Goblins, gnolls, orogs, and evil men find refuge in Adlersburg.
Even though the Duke of Wierech rules the province of Adler and
the military-minded priests of Kirche's Ttundarr maintain a presence
in the region, they cannot free the old Fortress of evil. <BR>
<BR>
The living evil <BR>
In truth, the humanoids and evil men of Adlersburg do not live
in the Fortress proper. They fear the ancient curse of Adlersburg
as well, but dare to come closer than most in their desperation.
They reside here against the hope of the current Duke of Wierech,
and against the orders of the Gorgon. Most are refugees from either
nation __ humanoids who escaped the Gorgon's armies just ahead
of the whip, and humans who fled Brechtr justice in Wierech, Dauren,
or Danigau. All told, nearly two hundred humanoids and evil humans
make their home here [enough for about 1 Mercenary Infantry unit,
using the Birthright(R) war card rules], but they will not unite
for anything but a life-or-death reason. In general, they hang
together in small bands of 10 to 30 members. The bands are better
equipped than most raiders __ rumor has it that the Urga-Zai goblins
have been known to send them gear and weapons from time to time.</CENTER></P>

<P>Description/History: Gorag is the latest in a series of dominant
bandits occupying the outskirts of Adlersburg. He commands the
largest, best-organized band of humanoids and evil men in the
region and would likely be the whole group's leader if it came
to a battle with outside forces. Gorag is tall, even for a gnoll
(nearly 8128 tall) and wields his halberd like a toy. Extremely
dangerous in combat, the black-furred gnoll still managed to accumulate
a number of bright red scars, the most prominent of which cuts
across the top of his nose. Rumor has it that he gained these
marks at the hands of the Gorgon's torturers, when he tried to
form his own band of gnolls with the Gorgon's Crown. Now, he leads
his bandits with almost military efficiency. Gorag desires to
loot the buried chambers beneath the ruined Tower of the Duke.
He does not believe in the &quot;curse of Adlersburg,&quot; but
his men do. He must either achieve some substantial victories
to impress them or find some other means of excavating the area.</P>

<P>Gorag's Bandits, male or female, human or humanoid, F2 (2040):
AC 5 (scale mail and shield); MV 9 (lightly encumbered); HD 2;
hp 12; THAC0 19; #AT 1; Dmg 1d8 or 1d6 (long sword or long bow);
SZ M (58 to 88 tall); ML steady (12); INT average (9); AL NE;
XP 65 each.</P>

<P><CENTER>Gorag's followers are exceptional humans, goblins,
gnolls, and orogs. They can be armed with any weapons, but Gorag
has trained 50% of them with the long bow. Gorag may have a 4th-level
lieutenant among them. <BR>
<BR>
The undead terrors <BR>
The bandits shun the interior of the old Fortress for a very good
reason. A few months after the Gorgon overran and plundered most
of the Fortress, he ordered his armies to excavate and loot the
sub-levels of the Tower of the Duke. Small foraging units organized
and the digging began. <BR>
It did not last long<BR>
Within a few hours, goblins and gnolls fled the area screaming,
and no amount of whipping or killing by their commanders could
get them to return to their duties. Fresh troops, along with armed
guards, were sent in, and many died of terror and horrible wounds
before they finally retreated. By this time, the armies of the
Brechts had driven back most of the Gorgon's over-extended armies
in the region. He did not wish to give up all his advantage over
some minor human treasures, so he ordered his armies to stop pillaging
and defend the Ruin of Adlersburg. Eventually, the Brechts drove
them out, and then they themselves left the area without disturbing
the dead. Legends speak of the Knights of Adlersburg and the Royal
Guard who died defending the Tower of the Duke at the very last.
Put to death in cruel and horrible ways, these valiant men and
women have been transformed into terrible undead, seeking vengeance
on their tormentors. <BR>
All manner of undead roam the Ruins. Lesser undead, such as zombies
and skeletons, number in the dozens. They arise only on special
occasions, however __ the anniversary of Adlersburg's fall, perhaps,
or when the Tower sub-levels are disturbed. Many of these creatures
have been laid to rest permanently over the years, but many more
still exist. <BR>
Greater undead inhabit the sub-levels of the Tower and some of
the remaining Fortress structures. Haunts appear to be the most
common in the outer regions. They hope to possess any available
bodies and trek to the Gorgon's Crown, there to fight against
the awnshegh's forces. Some say the haunts are all that remain
of the Speckled Guard, one of the Knights' most prominent regiments.
No more than a dozen haunts still lurk among the Ruins. Phantoms
exist in the upper Tower sub-levels. They drove the pillaging
armies of the Gorgon out of the Tower once before and seek to
keep the area inviolate from bandits, treasure hunters, and explorers.
At least five to ten phantoms haunt the first sub-level of the
Tower, still experiencing the tortures of the Gorgon and the last,
painful moments of their lives. Once, these men and women served
the Duke of Wierech as his personal servants and guards. Now,
they protect the Tower through eternity. <BR>
No one knows what other horrible undead may lurk in the lower
levels, since no reliable explorer has made it past the phantoms.
Some say wights, sent by the Gorgon, patrol the lower halls, to
keep anyone from plundering the Tower before him. Other, more
terrifying creatures may exist here as well __ though no reliable
information exists.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>The ghost of Adlersburg <BR>
Virtually every bard who sings of the Fall of Adlersburg ends
his story with the tale of the Anniversary Night and the Ghost
of Adlersburg. Every year, it is said, on the same night that
the Gorgon hurled his sorcerous blizzard and his hordes of undead
at Adlersburg, the battle is reenacted on the spirit plane. Those
who enter the ruin of the Fortress proper can see the Tower still
standing, in flames amid the snow, and can hear the cries of the
dying as the final assault begins. The battle culminates, as always,
with the fall of the Tower and the death of the Duke. <BR>
On these nights, some legends say, a true warrior of Wierech may
bypass the phantoms and the haunts of the Tower region and enter
the ghostly structure before it falls. The warrior may have to
undergo tests to prove his true heart. He may be tempted by treasures,
threatened by illusions, or actually have to fight evil undead.
The Gorgon's minions, the wights and other creatures, will certainly
try to stop him. <BR>
But, if the hero reaches the top of the Tower alive, he can confront
the Duke of Wierech's ghost. The ghost's power may or may not
affect the hero (depending on how successful he was in passing
the aforementioned tests), but the hero can try to persuade the
undead Duke to allow him to search the ruins underneath the Tower
for magic or treasure that could aid the people of Wierech. If
the Duke is convinced, he will call off his haunts and phantoms
(the other undead are beyond his control). The Duke may require
the hero to perform an additional quest of some sort if he is
not overly impressed, and he may reject the suit outright.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>Raising the curse <BR>
No one knows how many sub-levels may exist in the Ruins of Adlersburg,
or what monsters or undead may guard them. Gaining the permission
of the ghost of the old Duke might make entering the underground
levels possible, but the adventure begins there. In order to raise
the Curse of Adlersburg and put the undead to rest permanently,
the PCs must accomplish any number of goals, none of which should
be clearly defined. Any of the following goals may be required:
<BR>
&middot; v Vanquish or dispel all evil undead in the ruins. <BR>
&middot; v Rid the area of evil humanoids and humans. <BR>
&middot; v Recover the Duke's sword, Giantslayer, a magical weapon
with great powers and, perhaps, a powerful intelligence. <BR>
&middot; v Recover the bodies of the Duke's family, crushed and
buried when the Tower fell. <BR>
&middot; v Recover the eye of Adlersburg, a magical talisman to
the Gorgon's Crown and place it within sight of his tower. (The
true regent of Wierech can look through the eye of Adlersburg
and see anything within a one hundred yard radius of the eye if
it is properly planted). <BR>
The DM may also create other goals for would-be heroes to perform.
None should be easily accomplished, and many lead to other adventures
that could keep a hero adventuring in and around the Ruin of Adlersburg
for quite some time.</CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER>The treasure of Adlersburg <BR>
No one knows exactly what treasures lie buried beneath the Tower
of Adlersburg. Protected by undead and, possibly, powerful spells
and traps, the treasury of the former capital of Wierech has lain
undisturbed for centuries. <BR>
Some possible treasures include: <BR>
&middot; v More than 10,000 gp (5 Gold Bars) in money and jewelry;
<BR>
&middot; v The weapons and armor of the household guard (enough
to equip a unit __ about 200 men and women of infantry or elite
infantry); <BR>
&middot; v Magical treasures including the eye of Adlersburg,
the sword Giantslayer, and other legendary items (miscellaneous
magical items considered rare and powerful on Cerilia); and</CENTER></P>

1999 marks the 25th Anniversary of both the D&amp;D game and TSR
itself. As a part of our Silver Anniversary, we surveyed thousands
of gamers about the products they loved the most. <BR>
To celebrate this milestone, we're doing something very special.
Instead of just &quot;reprinting&quot; some old adventures, we'll
be returning to the scene of some of the greatest adventures in
the history of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game. <BR>
This year, you and your characters can return to the Keep on the
Borderlands, fight the battle for the lands of Geoff in Against
the Giants, and explore the mysteries of White Plume Mountain.
Each of these adventures is rewritten from scratch - but they
still retain the flavor of the original best-selling modules.
<BR>
We're also updating the original Dragonlance Adventures - the
&quot;DL&quot; series. The update will include rules for both
the D&amp;D and SAGA game systems. <BR>
And we'll have a special, spooky GenCon surprise for those who
make the trek to the annual gathering of fans in Milwaukee this
August!</B></CENTER></P>

The &quot;Cali Nightmare&quot; (Nightmare Survival) deck uses
Recurring Nightmare to recycle the numerous utility creatures
in the deck. With Survival of the Fittest, you can replace any
creature in your hand with the one you need at the moment. <BR>
My deck contains numerous Walls, as well as creatures that can
deal with any permanents and even cards in your opponent's hand.
For example, I have Nekrataal, Man-o'-War, and Spike Weaver for
creature defense; Cloudchaser Eagle to destroy enchantments; Uktabi
Orangutan for artifacts; Orcish Settlers for lands; and Thrull
Surgeon for hand destruction. I use Spike Feeder to gain life.
<BR>
Recurring Nightmare can bring any of these creatures back from
the graveyard whenever I need the creature's ability again. One
of the most powerful combos is recycling a Wall of Blossoms from
the graveyard by sacrificing another creature. The Wall lets you
draw a card when it comes into play, and you can then sacrifice
it to Recurring Nightmare to bring another card back from the
graveyard to destroy something else. Presto-you're up one card.
<BR>
This deck is very control-oriented. You can respond to any threat
your opponent puts on the board with one of your destruction creatures.
Once you establish control, you can recycle Verdant Force or Spirit
of the Night-these &quot;fatties&quot; take only a few turns to
kill your opponent. Verdant Force has an additional bonus. Putting
a 1/1 token into play each turn provides blockers, a creature
swarm or-best of all-a perfect little sacrifice so you don't lose
a real card when you recycle. <BR>
Bryce Currence and I added several cards the night before the
Standard portion of the tournament. The most unusual of these
was Scroll Rack, which we included because it helped pull out
Recurring Nightmare and Survival of the Fittest during testing.
Bryce and I also included main-deck Lobotomies to give the deck
a chance during game one against Prosperous Bloom and an advantage
against a mirror matchup. <BR>
In retrospect, adding the Scroll Racks might have been a mistake
because I played a lot of aggressive decks, and either had to
play cards as I drew them or use Firestorm to kill the opponent's
swarm of creatures. Currence and Alan Comer, though, made better
use of it, as they played against different deck styles. <BR>
The &quot;Cali Nightmare&quot; deck beats most creature-based
decks. The most difficult creature battles are against mirror
matches and Sligh. The deck has the most trouble against Prosperous
Bloom and mono-blue control decks. I could sideboard some combination
of four Boils, a Hall of Gemstone, three Emerald Charms, and two
Pyroblasts during these tough matches. Dread of Night defends
against white weenie, Staunch Defenders is useful against red,
and Phyrexian Furnace is helpful during mirror matches. <BR>

In theory, Sligh is not very strong because it's easily hosed
by sideboards and has little longevity. It seems like just a straightforward
aggressive deck that should lose to a Paladin en-Vec or even a
Wall of Blossoms. Players often write Sligh off as a deck that
can't beat recursion/Living Death or white weenie-in fact, a deck
that can be beaten by anything, with proper sideboarding. <BR>
I had swallowed this philosophy and was eventually beaten in the
finals of Pro Tour-Los Angeles by none other than Dave Price,
King of Sligh. Later I lost to Mike Turian, who was playing red
at Nationals. Dave Price then beat me around some more in playtesting.
These defeats resulted in a definite change in philosophy for
me concerning the viability of Sligh. <BR>
The amazing thing about Sligh is its potential for a devastating
fourth- or fifth-turn kill. Because of the deck's keen focus,
your opponent almost always needs a defensive draw to beat you.
For example, when a white weenie player only draws a bunch of
creatures with shadow, he or she has no creatures to block your
Jackal Pups, Ironclaw Orcs, and Ball Lightnings. You will surely
win this race. Sligh can also capitalize on an opponent's bad
draw, making a mulligan very costly for the opponent. <BR>
This brings up another important factor about Sligh-consistency.
Because the deck is mono-color it never gets color-hosed, and
with a large collection of low-casting cost spells (highest cost
is three), it easily survives on just a couple of lands. <BR>
The next important thing to examine is the metagame leading up
to Worlds. Although white weenie and mono-green did well at U.S.
Nationals (two bad matchups for Sligh), other events like the
European Championships would change the environment. &quot;Cuneo
Blue&quot; (a good matchup for Sligh) dominated that tournament,
so I expected to see that deck often at Worlds. <BR>
I also thought that Forbidian and &quot;Cuneo Blue,&quot; two
well-known decks, would scare some players away from white weenie
or mono-green at Worlds because these decks are vulnerable to
blue control decks. An additional benefit of blue decks performing
well in Europe, I thought, was that decks like white weenie and
those using Living Death would sideboard heavily against them,
leaving little room for cards to hose Sligh. <BR>
As usual there was a triangle of good and bad matchups. For the
most part, Sligh beats heavy control decks like Forbidian and
&quot;Cuneo Blue&quot; but hates decks with Living Death that
center around creature control. These heavy creature control decks,
in turn, lose to blue control decks. <BR>
Compared to the other Sligh deck in the Top 8, I had two more
creatures, which made my deck more aggressive. Plus, I filled
my mana curve with more cost-to-power efficient creatures. Some
other Sligh players also used Phyrexian Furnace to help against
graveyard recursion. I decided that because it could be destroyed
and didn't deal damage or help establish board control, I wouldn't
play it. <BR>

Brian Hacker<BR>
Quarterfinalist, 1998 Worlds <BR>
In playtesting for Worlds, I was wholly concerned with the Rath
Cycle portion of Constructed because I had little experience in
that format and there was no established environment. I worked
diligently on Rath, and as Worlds approached I had no Standard
deck. <BR>
I saw the decks from U.S. Nationals and liked Matt Linde's deck,
which won the tournament. It wasn't until the night before the
Standard portion of Worlds that I decided to abandon the idea
of playtesting to find a deck I liked, and instead take a preexisting
deck and mold it to the new environment that Worlds would offer.
<BR>
I concluded that I would encounter mostly Sligh and Draw-Go, with
Nightmare Survival only seeing much play from the Californians.
So I molded the sideboard to beat that field, and voil&agrave;,
my deck was made. The sideboard is heavily fortified against Draw-Go,
with three Cursed Scrolls, Armageddon, Abeyance, and additional
enchantment and artifact removal. <BR>
The main deck is a nightmare for Sligh with so many en-Kor and
creatures with protection from red. I added three Spirit Links
to insure a victory against Sligh. Nightmare Survival decks would
be a problem, and I made a metagame call to ignore them. It seems
silly now, given the performance of the Nightmare deck, but at
the time I thought if I took it into account, I would just be
tuning against my friends and teammates. As it turned out, I would
have actually tuned against the entire state of California and
half of the Top 8! <BR>
Game play is similar to that for most weenie decks. There are
seven turn-one plays, and then different options on turn two depending
on who you are playing against. Getting out a creature with protection
from red or an en-Kor is the key against Sligh. Against Draw-Go,
you need early shadow threats and an Empyrial Armor. <BR>
The creature with shadow/Empyrial Armor/Cataclysm combo was no
less powerful at the World Championships than when Linde ran it
at U.S. Nationals. Whenever you get a draw like that, you should
dominate your opponent. Empyrial Armor is the great damage threat
so you should always favor armoring a creature to playing more
creatures, except in rare situations against Sligh. <BR>
All in all, the deck is fun to play and it's only the sideboarding
that is tricky. You must make sure you don't take out so many
creatures that you make the deck creature-light. It is important
to retain a deck's nature any time you sideboard. For example,
players often make the mistake of sideboarding in so many counter
threats against Draw-Go that the deck lacks punch. <BR>
Against Nightmare Survival, my only advice is to use your Disenchants
to destroy Survival of the Fittest, and keep Aura of Silence to
handle Recurring Nightmare. Skilled players can stop you from
destroying their Nightmare, but at least you can make it cost
five mana. Otherwise, slap down an armored shadow creature and
ride it home (hoping your opponent can't get rid of it)! I hope
you have as much fun with the deck as I had playing it at Worlds.<B><FONT

Erik Lauer and I designed &quot;CMU Blue&quot; as a variant of
the deck Sturla Bingen used to win the European Championships
in July. Bingen's deck was an update of the Draw-Go deck first
built by Andrew Cuneo (a friend and associate of Team CMU). We
were particularly impressed by Bingen's decision to use four Force
Spikes. <BR>
Everyone knew Force Spike was good on turn one, but it's miserable
after about turn four. At least, it used to be miserable. With
the Exodus expansion came Forbid. Instead of being dead cards,
mid-game Force Spikes are now useful for buying back a Forbid.
At worst, they're still half a Counterspell. <BR>
Once we understood why Force Spike was now tourney-viable, Erik
and I began tuning our version of Blue Disk. Since Force Spike
lets you counter on turn one and Forbid means you never run out
of counters, this deck can cast a permission spell every turn
of the game. <BR>
Nevinyrral's Disks and Quicksands are crucial for dealing with
threats that sneak into play. Whispers of the Muse finds more
permission spells to make sure nothing else gets into play. After
you've gained complete control of the game, it's easy to kill
your opponent with either Rainbow Efreet or Stalking Stones. <BR>
Erik suggested adding more Stalking Stones. This gave us 26 lands,
enabling us to use early Impulses to grab important spells instead
of land. Extra land helped against other Blue Disk decks (which
were a definite threat after Bingen won the European Championships
and Jakub Slemr finished second with mono-blue Disk decks). Stalking
Stones provide an uncounterable 3/3 creature that puts a lot of
pressure on your opponents, forcing them to react to you. This
usually means you win permission wars since your opponent has
to start them. <BR>
The other unique thing about &quot;CMU Blue&quot; is the absence
of Steel Golems. Erik noticed that Steel Golems weren't working
against most of the decks we expected to face at Worlds. They're
good against mono-red, but that matchup is hard to win even with
Steel Golems. Against every other deck in our playtesting &quot;gauntlet,&quot;
Golems seemed mediocre. Erik suggested Dismiss instead, and the
deck immediately improved. Many players recently stopped using
Dismiss because of its casting cost, but since we had 26 lands
and 17 other counters, it wasn't hard to cast and wasn't taking
the place of cheaper permission spells. <BR>
The rest of the deck is more typical of this archetype. We felt
we needed eight two-mana permission spells to survive the early
game against weenie decks. Our testing indicated two Dissipates
were enough to remove Hammers from the game when needed. Forbid
seemed better than Dissipate in most matchups, so we used one
more Forbid than Dissipate. We couldn't afford to rely completely
on Stalking Stones to win in an environment that included Wasteland,
so we used one Rainbow Efreet. The Efreet has good synergy with
the Disk and is very threatening against both control decks and
Oath of Druids decks. <BR>
The sideboard definitely helped this deck at Worlds. Mono-red
is difficult to beat in game one, so we needed to be able to win
the next two games. Most people know Hydroblast is good against
mono-red, but Sea Sprites are even better. They control the red
creatures so we can use Hydroblasts as mana-efficient counters.
<BR>
Wastelands were used against Prosperous Bloom and Blue Disk. Prosperous
Bloom needs off-color cards from the sideboard against a control
deck. Abeyance and Pyroblast can't help much if your Cities of
Brass and Gemstone Mines get Wasted! Against other Blue Disk decks
it comes down to land, and when both players draw land, the matchup
re-volves around Stalking Stones, so Wastelands are crucial. <BR>
Capsize came in against white weenie (for Empyrial Armor), mono-green
(as a sink for Vineyard mana), and for anything slow (to Capsize-lock
them).</CENTER></P>
