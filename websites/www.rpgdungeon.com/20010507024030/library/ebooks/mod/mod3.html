Quint waited behind the tent, crouched in the shadows, grateful
for having worn all black that fateful day the Lyceum had been
attacked. By straining her ears, she could barely make out the
words being said inside, but try she did.</P>

<P>&quot;What say the gods, Eldson?&quot; she heard a voice command.
She was positive the red haired man had said the words -- his
temperament certainly matched his hair if that were the case.</P>

<P>&quot;They're unpleased, my prince,&quot; replied another voice.
&quot;But they are understanding. They do not blame you. They
blame that Master of Arms for not keeping his students in line.
You had no way of knowing she would not be there, and they will
forgive you this once. But if you fail another time, I don't think
they will be as forgiving.&quot;</P>

<P>Quint's eyes had grown wide at the mention of the Master of
Arms. Surely they aren't talking about Master Lyon!</P>

<P>&quot;That was always a failing of Lyon's,&quot; the first
voice said. &quot;He catered too much to his students' will and
desire. Instead of requiring discipline, he required nothing.&quot;
There was a pause. &quot;But that fire I've always admired about
him is still there. It still burns as bright as the first day
I meet him.&quot;</P>

<P>Quint stumbled, and hung onto one of the tent lines to right
herself. &quot;Oh gods,&quot; she said out loud, terrified at
the thought of Lyon being in league with this . . . murderer.
It was only then that she realized that inside the tent it had
grown quiet. She stood still, seeing if anyone had heard her,
when she heard a footstep behind her. Pivoting, she found herself
face-to-face with the red haired man.</P>

<P>For a moment, they merged into a powerful figure and both knew
that together, nothing could overcome them. The humans, the planet,
the universe which surrounded them meant nothing compared to their
existence. They grew high enough to reach the clouds . . . and
then the feeling burst into a million pieces of scattered light.</P>

<P>&quot;Milord Rowan, are you all right?&quot; A balding man
with brown eyes was looking fearfully at the red haired man.</P>

<P>Both Quint and Rowan shook themselves free from the other,
claiming their individual thoughts and souls. Quint gathered her
wits about her quicker than Rowan, and without really thinking,
ran away from the scene. From behind her, she heard Rowan yell
for his men to get her.</P>

<P>She wound her way through the trees, making sure not to make
too much noise, or at least not enough that those chasing her
could hear over the noise they were making. Suddenly Lyon was
in front of her, the moonlight glancing off his pale skin, making
him appear like a demented angel. Somehow she managed to stop
before crashing into him.</P>

<P>&quot;Master Lyon,&quot; she exclaimed breathlessly, momentarily
forgetting that he was her enemy. &quot;We thought you were dead!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Anything you've heard has been greatly exaggerated,&quot;
he bowed grandly. &quot;But you know, that was exactly what Brian
said what I first saw him.&quot;</P>

<P>Quint turned pale. &quot;You've seen Brian? If you've hurt
him . . . &quot;<BR>
Lyon laughed. &quot;I don't believe you're in the position to
be giving ultimatums.&quot;</P>

<P>She turned to run away, but Rowan and his men suddenly filled
in the open spaces. Rowan approached her cautiously, as if afraid
of their earlier feelings.</P>

<P>&quot;So you're the one the gods fear.&quot; His voice was
neutral.</P>

<P>Their green eyes met. &quot;Why?&quot; she softly questioned.</P>

<P>The prince tore his gaze away. &quot;It's up to them as to
whether or not they tell you.&quot; He took her arm. &quot;Why
don't you come with me and see what they say?&quot;</P>

<P>Angrily, she jerked her arm out of his grasp. &quot;Why don't
they come here?&quot;</P>

<P>Immediately, Lyon was there, wrenching her arm behind her back,
and then forcing it up. She gasped in pain, suddenly sure it would
break if he moved it another inch.</P>

<P>&quot;You're not in any position to be ordering people, or
gods, around,&quot; he hissed in her ear. He pushed her forward,
still tightly holding onto her arm. &quot;Follow the prince.&quot;</P>

<P>Swiftly they made their way back to Rowan's tent, where the
balding man awaited their arrival. The moment she walked through
the door, blazing red eyes turned upon her, studying her every
reaction.</P>

<P>&quot;Quint.&quot; The voice was unnerving and sent a shudder
up her spine. &quot;Do you truly not know the power you possess?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;What should we do with her, my gods? Should we kill her?&quot;
Lyon asked the gods who inhibited Eldson's body.</P>

<P>&quot;No,&quot; a faint grin touched the corners of Eldson's
mouth. &quot;Wait until we get to Pathageron. The man who calls
himself king will kill her, or we will kill him.&quot; And then
the red eyes flared up, burning its way into her soul. Gratefully
she fell into unconsciousness.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Brian awoke with a jolt, suddenly back in his own body. His
arms had cramped up sometime during the night and he unconsciously
rubbed them, trying to get the blood flowing once more. It only
took a slight while before full realization hit him -- he was
free. Curiosity stole over him, and he looked at the rope which
had held him. Squinting to get a better look, he noticed that
where it had been severed, it looked as if an animal had chewed
on it. He wondered what could have possessed an animal to chew
. . .</P>

<P>| Quint! | a voice not quite his own roared in his head, but
he was thinking of other things and so he did not even notice
that the voice sounded different.</P>

<P>Quint! his thought echoed and he dropped the rope he had been
holding. Quickly he made his way to the horse Lyon had left behind
and mounted. Then he stopped. Where am I going? He knew where
he wanted to ultimately end up at from his dream, but he had no
idea as to how to get to that point. He screamed in frustration
and listened to its echo, a slight grin on his face.</P>

<P>&quot;That sounded nice,&quot; he said to a nearby oak tree.
He paused, shaking his head. &quot;Talking to trees, oh gods,
I'm losing it. Though whether or not I ever had it is a good question.&quot;
Brian paused again. &quot;Now I'm talking to myself. I'd better
get moving before I start holding a political discussion with
a bird.&quot; Nudging the horse, he started heading north and
abruptly stopped. &quot;But where am I going?&quot;</P>

<P>| Wander. | The suggestion sounded as good as anything else
he had thought of. At that moment the horse decided it wanted
to go off toward the south and Brian made no move to stop her.</P>

<P>Or him, it, whatever this thing is. If she sees some good grass
somewhere else, I'm not one to deny her dinner. But how am I going
to find my way to Rowan's camp? He feel into a depression, his
thoughts dark and heavy.</P>

<P>The horse whickered, pulling him out of the endless circle
of guilt he had pulled himself into, and he looked around.</P>

<P>How did I get here? Was his lone thought. The horse had led
him straight to the edge of a camp which he instantly recognized.
His eyes skirted across the camp, searching for Quint. Oh, like
they're just going to leave her out in plain sight? Get with it,
stupid bard trainee. He found Rowan's tent and with no better
plan, decided to make his way there, sure that Quint would be
with the prince.</P>

<P>The next time the moon was hidden behind clouds, a shadowy
figure snuck across the dark camp. So far, so good, Brian thought
when a hand suddenly grabbed his collar, jerking his feet out
from under him.</P>

<P>&quot;Who are ya?&quot; The man's breath reeked of garlic.
&quot;What do ya want here?&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;I'm a messenger,&quot; Brian quickly made up. &quot;I
have a message for the prince.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, a messenger,&quot; the man sneered. &quot;I'm sure.&quot;
He hauled the trainee to his feet. &quot;But just in case, let's
take you to visit his highness. You can give him your message
personally.&quot; Briskly the soldier led him to Rowan's tent.<BR>
A soldier who stood, guarding the entrance to Rowan's tent, raised
an eyebrow as they approached.</P>

<P>&quot;Says he's a messenger,&quot; the man who held Brian growled.
&quot;Watch 'im while I go speak to his highness.&quot;</P>

<P>The other soldier nodded, then lifted the flaps so that he
could get through. He stood in silence until Rowan recognized
his presence.</P>

<P>&quot;What?&quot; the prince looked angry at the interruption.</P>

<P>&quot;Sire, there's a messenger outside who says he has a message
for you.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;A messenger? I'm not expecting any messages from anyone.&quot;
Rowan and Lyon exchanged glances, both curious. &quot;Send him
in.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;'mediately, sire.&quot; The soldier stepped outside,
and then right back in. &quot;He's gone, and the one who was guarding
him is dead.&quot;</P>

<P>Rowan rose to his feet, his features clouded with rage. &quot;Find
him! Have this camp searched. Look in every corner and box. No
one is to rest until he's found!&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wait,&quot; Lyon's voice was calm. &quot;There's no need
for that, my prince. I know where he's gone.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Always wipe your dagger, Brian recalled Lyon's words as he
wiped his dagger on the dead man's tunic. A bloody dagger rusts
faster than a clean one. Besides, it just looks bad. He sighed
slightly. No one will be able to say that Lyon was a bad teacher,
just a traitor. As if being a good teacher could cover his crimes.
Shaking his head clear of memories, he stood up, and sprinted
a distance away. There was no immediate alarm call so Brian figured
that nobody had seen him do the deed. After waiting a few more
moments, he started walking toward the middle of the camp, hoping
to learn the area and possibly where Quint was being held. Maybe
someone will mistake me for a soldier and tell me about the girl
who was brought in earlier. Or maybe they'll put me on dish duty.</P>

<P>&quot;So, do you always wander around, looking like a dead
fish?&quot; a huge man suddenly appeared by Brian's side. &quot;You
must be new here. I'm Harley.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Kevan,&quot; Brian quickly thought up, reluctant to give
up his real name. &quot;I just got here today. Would you mind
showing me around?&quot;</P>

<P>Harley flashed him a big grin, showing a mouthful of mostly
white teeth. &quot;It'll be a little interesting to give a tour
in the dark, but we'll stumble around. Follow me.&quot; He motioned
Brian over to a tent. &quot;This is where a lot of the practice
weapons are kept.&quot;</P>

<P>Obediently Brian followed the man around the camp, learning
its basic layout. After a half position or so, they returned to
the middle of the camp where they had started.</P>

<P>&quot;Do you have any other questions?&quot; Harley wandered.</P>

<P>&quot;Well,&quot; Brian made himself blush. &quot;I heard about
this girl . . . &quot;</P>

<P>&quot;There are no girls here, only men.&quot; Harley replied,
eyeing the trainee. &quot;Unless your tastes run in that direction.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Brian corrected. &quot;I heard that earlier
today the prince captured a girl. A girl that the gods want him
to kill.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Oh, that girl,&quot; Harley replied. &quot;I've heard
about that too, though I'm not sure if I believe it or not. In
truth, I don't really pay much attention to the gods, hoping that
if I leave them alone, that they'll leave me alone. But, the prince
does claim he talks to the gods -- perhaps through that priestly
looking fellow, Eldson. So there might be some claim to the story
and we do seem to have the most uncanny of luck at times . . .
&quot; He feel silent, contemplating this thoughts.</P>

<P>&quot;Do you think I could see her?&quot; Brian broke in.</P>

<P>&quot;Why?&quot; Harley looked at the trainee, suddenly suspicious
of his intentions.</P>

<P>&quot;Well, you see I made this bet with this guy, William,
right? And we bet ten gold pieces on her looks. I say the reason
that the gods want her killed is because she's so ugly that nobody
can stand to look at her for any length of time. William says
that the gods want her killed because she's so beautiful that
the want to make her a goddess -- and everyone knows you have
to die before becoming immortal.&quot; Brian caught his breath.
&quot;If you come along with me, you can be the judge.&quot;</P>

<P>Harley was laughing. &quot;All right, and then after this,
we can talk about other women whom nobody wants to kill.&quot;
The trainee followed the big man to a tent off to the right of
the camp. &quot;In here,&quot; the man said, waving him in.</P>

<P>Brian stepped inside, pausing at the entrance to let his eyes
adjust.</P>

<P>&quot;Brian,&quot; Lyon's voice rang out next to him. &quot;I
was getting worried that you weren't going to show up. How nice
of you to finally decide to join us.&quot;</P>
