<P>Recently, thanks to a disagreement with a Dark-Elf in the desert
of Ro I had to find another way to generate some cash. I wanted
to happily hunt Fire Beatles to fill my purse, and he wanting
to happily paint the desert red with my blood. Needless to say
his cry to the effect of, 'You are not of an experience to waste
my time on, but I will still smight you', left me to ask to leave,
for I defiantly heard my mother calling me. Never the less he
still wanted to play, but being a good boy I, while running, switched
my weapon and parrying dagger with my drum, both of which I keep
in easy to reach places, And began singing the Acceleration song.
By the time I reach the Southern Gate of Freeport I was bleeding
profusely and close to a loss of consciousness. But luckily I
left my newfound friend behind. Not wanting to venture in to the
desert till I was sure he had gone home, and not wanting to go
back to the over hunted Commonlands. I decided to get my fishing
pole out of the bank, and see how much I could roll the mer 3
Silver, 5 Copper I had into. In spent it all on bait @ 3 Copper
per unit. I then when to the dock, and straight into the water
(I forgot I was still playing my drum and singing the Acceleration
song. After a quick swim I was back on the docks again. I than
began to fish. Besides fish, I caught fish scales, rusted daggers,
and single tattered cloth sandals; which mad me wonder, if I fished
in the pool under the Academe of Magic would I find the stray
magic ring, or in the pool by the Hall of Truth would I get a
combination sword of a stray piece of plate? Any why, it was a
profitable endeavor for the most part. I sold the fish for just
over 2 Silver each, Fish scales went for just 4 Copper (still
more than the cost of bait), and the other items sold for just
over 2 silver each as well. I did lose my bait 2 times but I still
had more than I stated with approximately 1 Gold, 6 Silver for
the hole trip. Making for 1 Gold, 1 Silver of pure profit, the
greatest expense being 5 Silver and some time, which I did not
waste for I sang to keep my voice improving and checking my direction
to better my ability for when I really needed it. So there where
side benefits. I always try to capitalize on my down time, like
in the small bathing pool near the Theater of the Tranquil. I
practice my swimming without worry of Purina or sharks. I enter
it and walk to the back wall, when I reach it (either playing
my drum or just singing a song that will improve my abilities,
I will then start to sing (and play, how I do not know) and swim.
The only cost is food. I placed part of the fishing profits back
into bait to make more coin. The only draw back was when the pole
broke costing me around 2 Gold to replace. But this is better
than the drawback of a critical failure in say begging. For once
I hit the beg button by mistake to hear a guard say &quot;I will
teach you for your blasphemy!&quot; You think I said 'your grandmother
wears Shadow Knight's boots!' Not politely asking for a spare
copper or two. It was a lesson I will long remember, for you can
lose more than your pride by begging... Al in All, by the end
of my fishing trip I was ahead by 8 Gold for 1 full days work.
Not as Profitable as is hunting Fire Beatles in the Desert of
RO but a bit safer. For it also is not completely safe, for while
fishing a Shark popped out of the water to snap at my toes, I
then went to the raised area of the pier. Knowing my luck, they
probably can jump; but I digress... I hope those near a good sized
body of water think to buy a fishing pole and keep it stashed
away for those times you need a bit of safe coin. Like after losing
all ones possessions and having to start over. For one can stomp
a few rats to buy bait, then it is off to the waterside so you
can get coin for a weapon (or be luckily enough to fish one out
of the sea.</P>

<P><B><U>Some good words from SnowLynx:</U></B></P>

<P>After having read the original message and this further explanation
I feel very uncomfortable. A bard in the classical sense was a
teacher of the masses, in their historical guise as first level
Druids they where charged with helping the masses where the priests
where unable to. Their stories and songs contained news, moral
lessons, and good advice on life, love, and happiness. For any
to say you are wrong, and I do not have the time to correct is
only self-serving. Even the message I am replying to seems more
a justification that and explanation... Even to say Look at my
'experience' is a misnomer for much 'experience' can be granted
for being in the right place at the right time. It does not mean
one has learned anything. A bard never has to say here are my
credentials, for they know it is in their words, songs, and actions
where they will be found. A bard is a chronicler of others not
themselves. Leaving it to others to decide on the value of their
works. I am greatly distressed by this thread, but more over the
personal attack on others without offering help. For that shows
one that is more worried about being found inadequate rather than
wishing to be a light in the darkness. For it is good to offer
what one thinks is true, and allow ones self to be corrected.
Rather than keep quiet and not know the true value of ones knowledge.
It is easy to throw snipes, to be a source takes much more.</P>

<P>So please, if you have advice to offer, please do. If not please
do not just defame, but rather allow others to offer the proper
corrections. For it will help the poster as well as the reader
if a post (no matter how wrong) is made. So all can find the truth.
To remain silent is to remain ignorant. I am not saying that you
do not have a right to your option, say what you feel you should,
I only hope to say that others should not stop speaking for worry
of what another may say.</P>

<P><B><U>How to get the best from a Mailing List</U></B>:</P>

<P>OK ive been getting posts from several people on the content
of emails, here are a few ideas to use.</P>

<UL>
  <OL>
    <LI>Set up you onelist account to receive digest instead of every
    email, it is slower but you only get one or two a day.
    <LI>When replying to a post only repeat the part of the original
    message that pertains to what you are saying
    <LI>This is a message board about Bards, you may say whatever
    you wish and posting about a guild or person is a good way to
    let others of our profession know about something ahead of time.
    <LI>No I will not ban someone from the list unless they are being
    totally uncouth.
  </OL>

<P>Thank You, Toren L.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="+2">Spell Descriptions</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 1 - Chant of Battle<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This will boost the parties AC, STR and
DEX by a small ammount. It's not very powerful but it does help
a little</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 2 - Chords of Dissonance<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This spell does a small ammount of damage
with an area effect. This spell takes a long time just to get
a regular rat to half it's health but if you're fighting several
targets at once then the difference can be noticeable. Be very
careful using it around any npc's such as the guards since it
will hurt them also</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 3 - Jaxon's Jig o' Vigor<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This will decrease the fatigue of the party
by a small ammount. Great when swimming.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 4 - Lyssa's Locating
Lyric<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Click on the person whos corpse you want
to find, cast this spell and it will constantly update your heading
so you're pointing at the corpse. The corpse must be in the same
zone as you. This spell works very well and it will definitely
come in handy now and then.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 5 - Selo's Accelerando<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Cast this spell and you will be able to
out run almost anything, use it with a drum and you will. This
is one of the bard&#146;s best spells.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 6 - Hymn of Restoration<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This is the first really useful spell for
combat. It will constantly heal the party by 3 points every tick
(5 seconds), 6 points with a stringed instrument and plus the
1 point you usually get that's 7 points a tick. Plus another if
you're sitting down. I believe this spell does an extra 2 points
of healing for every 6 levels you gain over level 6</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 7 - Jonthan's Whistling
Warsong<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This only works on yourself and it will
increase your STR, AC and attack speed. I find that Hymn is better
unless you're attacking something that can't hurt you anyways
this will let you kill it a little faster</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 8 - Kelin's Lugubrious
Lament<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This will only work on a single target
at a time but if you have two monsters standing beside each other
and you know you can only handle one at a time you can cast it
on a one of them and lead the other away without the first one
attacking you. I've been told that if you time it right you can
work the effect on not only 1 but also 2 targets at a time which
would come in handy if you wanted to attack a camp. This spell
can be very useful if you learn to use it wisely</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 9 - Elemental Rhythms<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This will increase your fire, cold and
magic resistances each one by 15 and 27 if you're using a drum
with it. If your party is going to get blasted with magic attacks
from something like an evil eye and your extra attack power won't
be missed too sorely equip a drum and this spell can be a big
help</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 10 - Anthem de Arms<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This will increase the attack speed and
strength of the party. Hymn is often a better spell to use but
if you have 2 bards in a group, a lot of hitters or you're just
not taking much damage then this spell can be very useful. One
trick is if you alternate between this and hymn with the right
timing you and get the benefits of both spells</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 11 - Cinda's Charismatic
Carillon<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This spell apparently increases your faction
with an NPC, I've tested it out many times and haven't been able
to observe strong results so far...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 12 - Brusco's Boastful
Bellow<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Bellow is another spell you'll find yourself
using all the time. Target a monster cast the spell and it starts
off doing about a maximum of 7 points of damage which doesn't
sound like much but it never misses and it often does full damage.
I believe it does an extra point of damage every 2 levels above
12. After you hit the monster you will see a message saying 'monster
was hit by non mele damage' or something like that, hit the spell
button again really quickly to stop casting and hit it again to
recast it. When you get the timing right you can cast it just
as fast as swinging a longsword. This is also the first spell
a bard gets that's useful for drawing monsters at a distance</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 13 - Purifying Rythms<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This will increase your party&#146;s resistance
against poison, magic and disease each by 15 and 27 if you're
using a drum. This spell is just like the level 9 spell except
it effects more commonly dealt with attacks</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 14 - Lyssa's Cataloging
Libretto<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Cast this spell and click an item like
a ring on your person and it will tell you something about it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 15 - Kelin's Lucid Lullaby<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Run into an orc camp, cast this spell and
they will all fall asleep allowing you to attack them one by one.
This spell gets more powerful as you go up levels so after you
gain a few more levels you can do the same at a dervish camp.
Very powerful spell when there are a lot of easier monsters attacking
you. It usualy works flawlessly on monsters that con green to
you, works ok on monsters that are blue and anything greater then
blue it usually won't do much to.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 16 - Tarew's Aquatic
Ayre<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">As long as you are singing this song your
party can remain underwater indefinitely. If you want to explore
underwater or get into combat underwater this spell is a must</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 17 - Guardian Rhythms<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This will increase your parties resistance
against magic by 15 and 27 if you're holding a drum plus it will
increase your AC by 3 and 7 with a drum. The AC increase is insignificant
at this level so the level 13 spell seems like a better one to
keep memorized since it covers more attacks</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 18 - Denon's Disruptive
Discord<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This is just like the level 2 spell except
that it's area of effect is a little smaller and it also reduces
effected monsters AC. It dishes out approximately 4 points of
damage and 8 if you use it with a horn. If you have a bunch of
easier monsters attacking you and lulling them isn't worth it
then use this and they'll all be dead pretty quick</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 19 - Shauri's Sonorous
Clouding<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This spell will make your party invisible
but you must be holding a wind instrument for it to work at all.
Great spell for making your way through dangerous areas like highpass
hold by yourself but it doesn't work so well in a party since
the other pary members have to stay fairly close to you in order
to be effected and they can't see you</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 20 - Largo's Melodic
Binding<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">This is another area effect combat spell
so be careful around guards etc. It apparently reduces the effected
targets by decreasing their attack speed and AC. I haven't been
able to notice a difference so far; maybe I need to find a stopwatch
to time this stuff. Whether or not it works as assumed this won't
be one of those killer spells you'll find yourself looking forward
to</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#800000" SIZE="-1">Level 21 - Melanie's Mellifluous
Motion<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1">Cast this spell and roughly every 5 seconds
it wills randomly teleport you to a nearby location. Used with
a wind instrument it will teleport you farther. This spell even
works in a dungeon but I couldn't get it to teleport me through
walls or locked doors. This might come in handy if you're fighting
in a dungeon and since you can't use your speed spell this could
give you a little head start if you wanted to run from a fight<BR>
