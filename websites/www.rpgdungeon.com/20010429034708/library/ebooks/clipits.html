<P align=center><STRONG><U>Ye Olde Role Playing Games</U></STRONG><BR>Think it 
not a child's game for I, a Hero of The Goblin <BR>Wars, do play such Roles even 
in these present days. Several <BR>diverse companions and I gather at a safe 
retreat to enact <BR>the noble--and some not so--lives of times gone into mythic 
dust <BR>or even of times not yet born. Our assembled group spans some 
<BR>generations yet we are equals upon the playing field.. <BR>As a young squire 
I found great enjoyment in novels of fantasy <BR>and magic and I read them 
still, almost to the very exclusion of all <BR>else. When I reached an age of 
young manhood, the fates brought <BR>together a group of seasoned and yearling 
Mages, Clerics, Dwarves <BR>and Fighters within the Dungeon of 
Something-or-Other where the <BR>uniqueness and challenge of Role Playing became 
known to me. <BR>With the passage of time 'Coffee Table' RPGs became ye olde BBS 
<BR>RPGs and MUDs; computer games got better, and now online Web play. <BR>Now 
it seems I've come full circle and am sitting 'round that coffee table <BR>once 
again! We enter helpless, and we exit helpless, eh?<BR></P>
