<P>He watched his opponent warily, watching the eyes, not the flickering blade 
that sought out a hole in his guard, the one fatal slip in every duel that cost 
a man his life. <I>There!</I> Lorne feinted to the side, the swish of the blade 
and opponent’s frustrated snarl music to his ears. One more second added to his 
life. But seconds were all the difference in fights like these, time seemed to 
slide and warp, each sword stroke seemingly in slow motion, each move 
deliberate.</P>
<P>Lorne swung his sword, putting the whole of his weight behind the stroke, the 
shock of defeat in the eyes of his enemy, death realized in one sure blow-</P>
<P>And Lorne disarmed him easily, catching his sword in one hand, grinning 
widely.</P>
<P>"Gods, Lorne, that’s three in a row!" the man shook his head, anger in his 
eyes. Not at Lorne, for Ronan would sooner kill anyone else than become angry at 
his friend, whom he had played with as a child, wrestled with as they grew, and 
finally fought beside in the Mage Wars, where they had never left each other’s 
side. And a good thing, many a good soldier died before the proud mages of 
Ardyrinthir and their armies of Manifestations had consented to defeat.</P>
<P>Ronan shivered, thinking back to those times seemed to draw a shadow over his 
soul, the mages had come too close to winning, and for a short time they had 
been fighting a losing battle, fighting with the desperation that came with the 
knowledge of what was at risk. The mages had no love for the <I>sluah 
dhe’sidhean</I>, the race of man that devoted themselves to unlocking the 
secrets of science. If they had succeeded in the battle of Naramthe Plain, the 
gleaming skyscrapers of their cities would be no more than smoldering rubble, 
their research centers methodically and coldly wiped off the pages of history, 
and magick’s rule would have been uncontested for many a year.</P>
<P>"C’mon, Ronan, you weren’t that bad, why the long face?" Lorne teased, 
tossing him his sword. "You beat me often enough, when you aren’t distracted." 
His friend waited expectantly for an answer.</P>
<P>"Just…remembering," Ronan said slowly, drawing his fingers through his white 
hair. White hair, the one way to tell who had been in the front lines. Wild 
magick seemed to draw the color out of the people, the mages themselves had 
brilliantly silver hair, and fair skin. And anyone that was exposed to enough 
wild magick started to lose color, becoming more and more like the <I>dalraech 
dhe’aon, </I>until they could almost be mistaken for a mage. And in battles that 
was not a good thing. Towards the end of that bloody campaign, the two friends 
had been defending themselves against their own kind as much as the mages.</P>
<P>"Well cheer up!" Lorne said, chucking him on the shoulder. "We won, after 
all!" his smile was forced though, and his eyes betrayed the falsity of it.</P>
<P>"You know they’re not beaten," Ronan said bitterly, running his thumb over 
his sword, eyes focused on its lethal edge. "Just suing for peace until they can 
conjure more of those thrice-damned creatures of theirs!"</P>
<P>Lorne grimaced. "You’re right, of course, but when they show their true 
colors, we’ll beat them back into their land, and then some." He smiled again, 
hopeful.</P>
<P>"Not if the Centre doesn’t come up with a new weapon soon," Ronan said, 
sheathing his sword. "I’m going back to the Mess Hall, it’s getting late. I 
don’t suppose you’ll be following?"</P>
<P>"No, but you know where you’ll find me."</P>
<P>Ronan grinned. "Yeah, sparring with one of those holograms. It’s no wonder 
you’re one of the best blades we’ve got." And with that he turned, and walked 
away, his lengthening shadow stretching across the grass, its tip on one of the 
walkways criss-crossing the parkway.</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2> </FONT></P>
<P>Dawn broke golden over the shining city, reflected in the glass windows, 
shattered into a thousand glittering fragments, skipping across the rooftops, 
warming the streets below. Air began to swirl as the pavement began to heat up, 
the wind blowing idly away from the city, out to the plains beyond…</P>
<P>Nick wiped sweat off his brow, though the morning was still cool. In front of 
him was the central computer, the graphs and numbers telling the conditions of 
the experiment out five hundred paces in front of him, where three other 
scientists were grouped. After a moment more, they came back, most looking over 
their shoulders at the contraption that lay innocently under the new sun. </P>
<P>It was a mold for a blade, with tubes and wires twined around it, and two 
containers of liquid, one a light green, the other a dark red. Nick looked 
nervously at his approaching colleagues.</P><FONT size=2>
<P></FONT>"Well? Is everything ready?"</P>
<P>Jim looked at Nik, and laughed. "Calm down Nik, it’ll all work out."</P>
<P>A man behind him mumbled something. </P>
<P>Jim turned. "What, Jared?"</P>
<P>"I just need to connect my data analyzer," he said lowly, and walked off to 
one of the main computers.</P>
<P>The rest of the scientists arranged behind a protective wall, putting on 
shaded goggles as a precaution. Their theories were proved, the technology sound 
logic, but things could always go wrong. And they had to be prepared.</P>
<P>After a long interim when Jared tried to get the computers to hook up, they 
looked at each other in shared suspense, and pressed the button.</P>
<P>The two chemicals poured into the mold, changing immediately to a silvery 
grey, and Jared spoke up.</P>
<P>"No anomalies detected yet, material stabilized, energy output at normal 
levels."</P>
<P>"Until now," Nik muttered, and pressed a button.</P>
<P>A faint light flashed around the sword, then vanished.</P>
<P>The scientists held their breath.</P>
<P>Jared stared at the screen, chewing on his bottom lips, watching the numbers 
scroll down. "Crystallization process begun, everything seems alright…"</P>
<P></P>
<P>The edge of the sword began to crystallize, its edge honing itself using 
technology in its infant stages. By powers of ten the sword began to get 
sharper, its edge now as big as an atom, still forming, now as small as a 
quark…</P>
<P></P>
<P>"No!" Jared shouted as he watched the numbers in disbelief. "The magnetic 
field is starting to fail!"</P>
<P>The scientists looked in horror as the sword began to slide downward, slide 
towards the machinery and the ground.</P>
<P>"How can it?" Jim stuttered in disbelief. "It’s not-" he stopped, as they 
implications began to sink in.</P>
<P>"It’s sharper than an electron?" he said hoarsely, and backed up a step.</P>
<P>"If it is and hits the ground, it’ll split the atoms, the nuclear 
explosion…"</P>
<P>Now the dread of their own death shone in their eyes, and they looked at the 
sword as the very tip lightly touched the metal…</P>
<P>…and a flash of light blinded them momentarily, the concussion of sound 
deafening, ripping across the air as if to tear the fabric of reality 
itself.</P>
<P>When their vision cleared, they looked at the place where the sword had been. 
A small smoldering crater was left, no bigger than a sheet of paper. Their 
equipment lay melted on the ground, victim to the smallest nuclear explosion 
ever created.</P>
<P>"W-w-why?" said Jim, unstuffing his ears.</P>
<P>"The explosion must have shattered the blade before it could split another 
atom," Nik said pensively.</P>
<P>"If it’s that sharp, it’s going to be easy to break."</P>
<P>"Not if we can somehow make it stronger…"</P><NO_INDEX>
