So you've read all the reviews, listened to your friends brag
about it, upgraded your computer, and finally saved your $50 plus
some extra for the monthly fees and bought the EverQuest game.
Now what?? Well, that is what I'm about to tell you&#133;<BR>
<BR>
Let me first start by saying this is not going to tell you how
to set up speech macros, hot buttons, or even how to make your
character move. That is what the Everquest tutorial program, players
guide, and handbooks are for and I suggest you make use of them
before attempting to play the game. Instead, I wish to give the
inexperienced player some tips to help you progress through the
lower levels of the game a little easier than many of us others
did.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#778899" SIZE="+1" FACE="arial">Character
Creation</FONT><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"><BR>
<BR>
Let's talk about your character selection first since you have
to do that before you can play the game. What to choose??? What
to choose??? So many races and classes and heck, you even have
to decide on a male or female character. Lets start with your
sex. NO, I don't mean when you had it last, I mean do you want
to be male or female? It does not appear to affect game stats
or play whether you are male or female so this should be the easiest
choice you have to make at this point. Now that you've picked
a gender, the fun begins.<BR>
<BR>
I cannot emphasize enough that you need to choose your character
wisely for the style of game play that you are looking for. The
wrong selection now means hours of wasted game play if you decide
later that you picked poorly. Unfortunately, most bad choices
will not show up until much later in the game as your character
gains the ability to adventure outside the newbie areas.<BR>
<BR>
After choosing a sex, you're next choice should be if you want
to play a character of an evil or good race. My recommendation
is to choose a good race for now. You can always start your evil
character later when you know much more about game play. The reason
I say this is because evil characters have a difficult time traveling
outside the city zones that you start in. There are far and away
more good races than bad and believe me NPC's will attack you
on sight. You have little or no chance of surviving these attacks
until you obtain much higher levels (as if the higher level monsters
weren't bad enough). So for now lets rule out being a dark elf,
troll, or ogre. Although, I do encourage you to play one later
on to enhance the RPG experience.<BR>
<BR>
Now we have ruled out 3 races for your starting character. Which
of the others will you choose? Well let's make that decision after
you decide what class you want to be. While you will see a lot
of class variations, there are really only 3 classes: magic user,
multi-class, and fighter. Oh wait, I don't see the multi-class,
fighter, or magic user listed on the chart. Well they are there
just under different names and let's discuss them now.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#778899" SIZE="+1" FACE="arial">Magic Users<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"><A HREF="http://www.pcvelocity.com/gaming/articles/everquestnewbieguide/e11.jpg"><IMG 
SRC="http://www.pcvelocity.com/gaming/articles/everquestnewbieguide/te11.jpg"
ALIGN="RIGHT"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">Classes
that I consider magic users are ones that can only wear cloth
as armor and are very limited in weapon choice (usually a staff
or dagger). They do have weapon and defensive skills, but they
fail by comparison even to the multi-classed character, let alone
a pure bread warrior. Instead, magic users rely on powerful offensive
and defensive spells to win battles for them.<BR>
<BR>
They are normally the most intelligent of their races and that
often means the weakest as well. Hit points are very low for magic
users as well as the damage they can do with their weapon, which
usually means sure death for the magic user who doesn't have enough
mana for the job at hand. Intelligence and wisdom are key factors
in determining you mana count so be sure to put plenty of extra
bonus points in there at the time of creation.<BR>
<BR>
Magic users are the most difficult class to advance in, but in
the end they are probably the most powerful. These classes are
also the least expensive. The cloth armor that a magic user wears
is very inexpensive compared to the other armors available and
while some spells at upper levels can cost nearly 30 platinum,
(plat) a steel plate breast piece can run 600 plat or more. Some
examples of these classes are the magician, wizard, enchanter,
and necromancer.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#778899" SIZE="+1" FACE="arial">Multi-class</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"><BR>
<BR>
What I consider to be a multi-classed character is any class that
uses both magic and warrior skills. Many of them can wear any
armor they choose up to iron, and, in the case of the cleric,
they can even wear the prized steel plate. The multi-classed characters
also have the ability to use most any weapon they choose, the
loser in that category being the clerics and shamans who can only
use blunt weapons. They also get to cast spells, which is why
I call them multi-classed.<BR>
<BR>
The spells of the multi-classed character are not often as damage-oriented
as the magic users'. Of the good damage-oriented spells available,
the multi classed character will find himself struggling to have
enough mana to use them more than a couple of times before relying
on their warrior skills to finish the job. Instead, multi-classed
spells prove to be much more beneficial in nature. Their spells
range from healing, to hit point and armor class buffs, and even
to spells for speedier movement. These classes progress a little
easier than a magic user due to the higher hit points, better
armor, and weapons.<BR>
<BR>
Multi-class characters have the honor of being among the most
expensive classes. If buying spells wasn't enough, try putting
armor and weapons on your character as well and you'll find yourself
being very stingy with the coppers.<BR>
<BR>
Multi-classed characters are well rounded and are always in demand
for group hunts due to their healing spells. Those same healing
spells help them advance levels faster. While the warrior and
magic user are sitting around waiting to heal from the previous
fight, the multi-classed character has healed himself and is off
to the races again recovering mana while battling it out with
the sword or mace. A few examples of multi-classed characters
would be the cleric, shaman, ranger, druid, paladin, and others.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#778899" SIZE="+1" FACE="arial">Fighters</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"><BR>
<BR>
There only seems to be two fighter classes in EverQuest at this
time: the warrior and the monk. </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"><A
HREF="http://www.pcvelocity.com/gaming/articles/everquestnewbieguide/e16.jpg"><IMG 
SRC="http://www.pcvelocity.com/gaming/articles/everquestnewbieguide/te16.jpg"
ALIGN="LEFT"></A></FONT><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial">(I
personally would like to see some more) The warrior and the monk
have a good number of hit points compared to the other classes
and don't use magic of any sort. Just to give a idea of the hit
point advantages: the warrior has about double the hit points
of a pure magic user and on average about 10 hit points per level
more than a multi-classed character. Well what does that mean?
What is the big deal about 10 hit points? In Everquest you can
obtain a maximum level of 50. Well you do the math. That's around
500 more hit points for the warrior in the end and lets not even
discuss how many more hit points than a magic user he will have.<BR>
<BR>
The nickname for the warrior is &quot;tank&quot; and there is
no wonder why. With all their hit points, armor, and lack of intelligence,
the name just seems to fit the bill. You'll normally find the
warrior on the front line in any battle and is counted on by the
other classes to keep monsters off them as they work their magic.<BR>
<BR>
The warrior advances relatively easily due to the large number
of hit points, choice of weapon and armor, and the extra damage
skills they learn early on. The warrior gets the added skills
of kicking, bashing, dodging, dual wield, and parrying just to
name a few (some of the multi-classed characters get some of these
as well, but never all of them and only at a much higher level
than when the warrior learns them). These not only help dish out
extra damage but help the warrior avoid it as well.<BR>
<BR>
The warrior class is expensive to arm and equip but at least they
don't have to buy spells too. The monk class is probably the least
expensive as they don't rely on weapons and armor as much as the
warrior does because the monk's body is his weapon and a good
one at that. They are to me the most fun to watch in battle at
higher levels because they have some of the most fascinating and
deadly moves in the game.<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">Let's face it - starting a new
character in EverQuest can be a tough experience, especially if
you don't know a lot about the game. The creation screen alone
can be overwhelming if you don't know much about the options available,
and many players go through several starting characters before
finally finding the right one for their style. Fear not - for
this week's eXcursion, I've put together several charts that should
provide some guidance for starting out in EQ. I've played the
game with every race, and I can assure you these tips come from
a wealth of experience.</FONT></P>

<P><CENTER>Since it can be difficult to decide where to begin
your game, I've thrown together a chart that tells which cities
are good for each race to begin questing in. Below that is a chart
listing the names of the three best continent starting points
in the game. Finally, I have a chart that provides some of the
best class/race combinations with the pros and cons of each to
help you pick a character that suits your playing style the best.<BR>

Well, now that you know a little about the different classes it
is time to choose one. You want my recommendation? Well, I'm sorry,
but I just can't give you one. I have personally played a shaman,
warrior, enchanter, and wizard and each have advantages and disadvantages
as mentioned above. They have all been very fun to play and perhaps
if I had limited myself to only one, that one would be of much
higher level. But, I enjoy the change of pace from time to time
and I encourage you to try other race/class combinations as well.
However, I encourage you to get the feel for the game first before
starting a second character.<BR>
<BR>
After choosing a class you will see the available races light
up to the left. I recommend choosing the race whose stats best
suit the class you have chosen. For example magic users seem best
suited to be high elves, gnomes, or the like because of the higher
intelligence factors of these races. A barbarian warrior is tough
to stop because of the extra strength of that race. Dwarves also
make excellent warriors as well as my personal favorite to be
a cleric. Humans seem to be the medium that all other races are
judged by. What I mean is that a human seems to be average in
every way.<BR>
<BR>
So what race are you going to chose? If it comes down to a tough
decision, remember that some races have infravision and others
do not. All things being equal, I'll take the one with infravision
every time. And, after you play the game and see just how dark
that screen can get at night or in a hallway, you will too.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana">Now it is
time to spend your bonus points. After choosing a race and class,
the game highlights the most important stats for you. For example,
if you chose to be a barbarian warrior you would find the strength
and stamina stats highlighted in green. Everquest has done this
for a very good reason and you would be foolish to ignore it.
Spend those bonus points in the areas highlighted as they are
crucial to your class. How you spend them, though, is up to you.
You can ignore the primary stats altogether, you can dump them
all in just one area of your primary needs, or you can spread
them around a little. It's really a tough decision to make.<BR>
<BR>
If you are a warrior you can dump most in stamina for better hit
points or into strength for higher damage hits and the ability
to carry more. Or, you could balance the two out. Again, it is
a decision you are going to have to make and I really can't say
which is the best route to take except in the case of magic users.
I seriously suggest that you put every point you have into mana
generating stats like intelligence and wisdom. That is your key
to survival in this game.<BR>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana"><BR>
The next step is to choose a name. You may already have one in
mind and if you do, great! Enter your name now and see if the
game will accept it. Remember that Everquest is an RPG and common
names are not normally allowed through the filter. Also, if the
name you have chosen is already taken it will reject yours as
well. If you have a problem thinking of a name then use the random
name generator that Everquest has graciously provided for some
of us less imaginative people.<BR>

  <P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana">TIP:
  do not use vulgar or otherwise untactful names. Even if you can
  get it through the filter somehow, the GM's will change it as

  it later. It is also likely to be an undesirable name as punishment

The starting city for each race is different. Some races even
have more than one starting location. Basically, it doesn't matter
where you start, as the programmers have done a very good job
of creating nice newbie zones at every city. You will not likely
want to adventure outside of these zones till you are level 5
either. So make your starting city selection now to finish your
character creation.<BR>

Congratulations, you have just made your first Everquest character
and, having finished the tutorial program and read the players
guide and handbook, you are ready to start your adventure! So
go ahead and select the character you just made and enter the
game.<BR>
<BR>
When you first appear in the game you will notice in your inventory
a parchment, a book, a weapon of some sort, food, water, and two
spells (if your character has the ability to cast spells).<BR>
<BR>

ALIGN="LEFT"></A><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">Let
me first explain about your food supplies, as the guidebooks don't
seem to answer all of the questions that arise. You eat and drink
automatically. When your character gets hungry or thirsty the
game starts searching your inventory for drinks and food. It will
take from the first food and drink group it comes to. Then the
game finishes searching your inventory and if you are low on food
and drink the game then, in a most annoying way, advises you over
and over till you get more. If you run out of food or drink you
will not be able to heal naturally in the game anymore. Also,
your stamina starts to fall after a length of time. This could
prove deadly if you are caught on the road somewhere, so always
carry a good supply of food and drink with you.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana">There are
a number of forms that food and drink can come in so don't make
the mistake that I did and go searching the vendors for the same
type you started with. Any type will do and there doesn't seem
to be any real difference in how long they last. So if you buy
food and drink, get the cheapest you can find.<BR>
<BR>
There are some classes that can summon their own food and drink.
While this saves money, you will have to do it each time you log
on and as you progress in levels you will find yourself just buying
it instead to save game time. Some classes can also forage for
food. This also proves useful, but you might starve to death before
you are successful at lower levels. Every class can also fish
for their food. But, you will find yourself losing money till
you gain a few levels as fishing rods do break pretty easily in
this game. Even in the upper levels fishing is a tedious, time
consuming act, and I think most folks would rather buy their food
and continue adventuring rather than wasting valuable game time
trying to catch your next meal. <BR>

<UL>
  <P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana">TIP:
  as a newbie you will notice that every time you die you get a
  new set of food and drink. This will happen till you are level
  4. So if you get low on food before you reach level 4 just let
  yourself get killed or attack a guard and they will gladly do
  it for you in a hurry and you will have a fresh set of food and
  drink. Also you may want to do this just before you make level
  4 so that you have a small supply to last you as long as possible
  before you have to start shelling out those coppers for them.</FONT></I></CENTER>

The next thing I want to discuss is the book you will find in
your inventory. This book allows a player to become a PK (player
killer) and participate in PvP (player verses player) activities
in the game by turning on your PK switch. Essentially that means
your name will become red, while all non-PvP players have blue
names.<BR>
<BR>

ALIGN="LEFT"></A><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">Please note that the system
that Everquest has in place now does not allow a player that is
PvP to attack a player that is not. If you want huge PvP excitement
then you should check out the PvP server that Everquest has created
for players like yourself. If, however, you want to just add a
little excitement from time to time, then stay on a regular server
and play as a PK.<BR>
<BR>
My recommendation, however, is to place that book in the bank
for now. You can give it to the Priest of Discord anytime you
desire. Why do it now when you are going to lose to anyone you
face, anyway? Also, I have noticed some of the cowardly, low life,
childish PK's hanging out in the newbie zones killing the just
created characters. What pleasure that could bring them I have
no idea. Beware of this and wait till you advance some to participate
in PvP.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1" FACE="arial">The First
Quest</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff"><BR>
<BR>
Now lets equip your character, scribe your spells into your spell
book, and memorize them (all of this is covered in the tutorial
program). After that is done you need to find the guild house
for the class you have chosen and give the letter on the parchment
to the appropriate person. (The name will appear on the parchment&#133;to
read it just right click on the parchment and it will open a screen
with the instructions on who to give it to) When you have given
your guild master the parchment he will reward you with a small
amount of experience and some type of armor. This armor is always
some form of cloth like a tattered shirt or a robe if you chose
a magic users class. Go ahead and equip that now as well.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></CENTER></P>

<UL>
  <P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">TIP: you will notice while
  you are at your guild master that you already have 5 practice
  points you can spend. Some people spend practice points as soon
  as they get them and it is fine if you do the same. My personal
  philosophy has been to save those practice points for skill activation
  at latter levels and also to use them to gain good understanding
  of trade skills. It seems a waste to use them on things you will
  gain quickly from fighting such as defense, offense, or a weapon
  skill.</FONT></I></CENTER>
</UL>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana">Having
equipped your character with their meager belongings I think now
would be a great time to look around the city you are in and learn
who sells what and where everything is. You may have found all
this out already as some guilds are tough to find. Notice all
the items that are for sale and make mental or written notes as
to where these items are so you can find them again quickly later
on. Be sure to find your bank as you will visit it often. While
you are there, you should go ahead and deposit your PvP book.
This way you will have that slot available for more treasures.<BR>
<BR>
Also, you will want to talk to the NPC's of the city and see if
any of them have quests for you including your guild master. Some
quests are quite easy to complete, even for the beginner, and
can have big benefits for you. All completed quests yield experience
points and most of the time an item of some sort. You may find
this item very useful, and, if not, you can always sell it and
put the money gained towards something else. You will also notice
your faction standing increase as you complete quests. This will
help you later in the game because, as your faction with the people
of the city you are in increases, the prices the merchants charge
for goods decrease and the merchants also pay more for goods you
sell them. A higher faction rating may also make some quests available
to you that were not previously.<BR>

 COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana"><BR>
<BR>
Now that you have your character equipped, learned of a few quests,
and explored your home city it is time to start your adventuring.
Having looked around the city you already know where the gates
(or in the case of Wood Elves, lifts) are. As you exit the city
you will always find guards posted there. Those guards serve several
purposes. They are there to protect the city from would be invaders
and to give its citizens protection from the dangers of the outside
world. Remember where they are and take notes of any others you
might see while adventuring because they will save your life time
and time again. For the first level or two I don't recommend leaving
the site of the guards so that if you get into trouble you can
run to them and they will eliminate the foe you were unable to
handle.<BR>

The basic strategy for the first couple of levels is simple. Kill.
Rest. Kill. While that strategy never changes much, it does take
on new meaning in later levels, but we are not here to discuss
that. We want to help you become able to adventure outside your
starting area by gaining levels and learning how to fight. Here's
how:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ffffff" SIZE="+1" FACE="arial">The Warrior</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#ffffff"><BR>
<BR>
The warrior will have the easiest time fighting as all he has
to do is select the target and attack it while occasionally pressing
the kick button (you should have hot buttons set for your melee
attack and kick attack). With the warrior's extra hit points he
will have no problem taking on the creatures found in the starting
zones and can, in some cases, even take on two at once. However,
trying for three is probably asking for trouble at this point.
<BR>
<BR>
So what is my big tip for the warrior class? Well I don't have
a big one. Only that you should make full use of your ability
to kick an opponent and use it every time it is available to you.
Also, avoid entering fights unless you are at full or almost full
health. You can rest by the guards between fights to avoid sudden
unwanted attacks. The reason for this is that many of the creatures
wandering around in this game don't mind attacking in pairs or
even trios. If a creature comes along while you are in a fight
it will often join in. And, unless you started at full health,
you may not be able to finish off your first foe, thus losing
out on valuable experience points that you could have gained.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
9<FONT COLOR="#778899" SIZE="+1" FACE="arial">The Multi-class</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"><BR>
<BR>
The multi-classed character will find things a little harder than
the warrior as your hit points will be fewer. A good strategy
I have found for the multi-classed player is to use any buffing
spell you have on yourself before entering the war zone and always
start off a fight with your offensive spell. This will chisel
away a few hit points from your opponent and make the fight a
little more even.<BR>
<BR>
During a fight as a multi-classed character I rarely try to get
off any spells. I let my sword or club do the talking for me.
Often as a fight begins to wear down and you look victorious your
opponent will attempt to run away. This is an advantage for spell
casters in that the warrior will have to chase them down but the
spell caster can just lay the offensive spells to them and may
never have to leave the spot from which they were fighting except
to collect the loot. If your mana looks low, however, you may
wish to chase rather than spending what you have remaining.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the multi-classed characters have some form of a healing
spell or another. So once the battle is over you can use your
remaining mana to heal and normally fight another opponent right
away. You will eventually wear down in both health and mana and
have to take a break like the warrior and magic user do.<BR>
<BR>
Now, many of you probably want to know if you can heal yourself
during battle and the answer is yes but it is difficult. First
of all don't make the mistake of healing the creature you are
fighting as it will be your current target. You must press the
F1 key first to select yourself as the current target then cast
your spell. If you get hit while casting your spell it will be
interrupted and you will have taken a hit without trying to deliver
one. If this happens too many times or the creature is hitting
you for more damage than your spell will heal, then it is time
to find a guard to help with your problem.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#778899" SIZE="+1" FACE="arial">The Magic
User</FONT><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="arial"><BR>
<BR>
The poor magic user will find the going the roughest as they are
by far the hardest to advance. Their frail bodies have few hit
points and the damage they can deliver from a weapon is minimal
to say the least. So how does the magic use make the next level?
Simple, if you follow my advice.<BR>
<BR>
First of all, never engage in a fight with multiple opponents
(unless you out level them by a good bit). The chance of one of
these opponents hitting you and interrupting your spell is too
great. So, if you accidentally engage more than one just run to
a guard and try again. There is no reason to lose your health
and have to wait for it to regenerate because you tried a fight
that you might only win one out of five times. My next suggestion
is to start the fight as far away from your opponent as possible.
By doing this you may be able to get off two spells before your
opponent can reach you. This will make your fight much easier.<BR>
<BR>
Also, I know that I have harped about how a magic user has little
offensive and defensive capabilities, but I want you to use your
dagger or staff and take a lick or two. Don't do this at the expense
of losing the fight, however. This will help raise your fighting
skills some and make you better at getting off spells without
being interrupted. After you advance a few levels and get new
spells you will find yourself grouping a lot. This is a good thing
to do, but the magic users' role often finds them standing in
the background casting while a tank is blocking for him. This
will only have a negative effect for the magic user as he will
continue to gain levels without learning any fighting skills and
this will lead to the magic user being totally dependant on groups
to advance as they cannot stand up to an opponent solo.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana">My advice
then is to spend some time alone working on those fighting skills
even if it is with a lesser creature. And, if you get a safe opportunity
to join in the battle while grouped, by all means do so&#133;but
never at the expense of someone's life. The others in your group
count on you to do the most damage. As a magic user advances,
his spells can do more damage faster than the rest of the group
combined. So bear this valuable information in mind as you progress.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#778899" SIZE="+1" FACE="arial">Victory</FONT><FONT
 COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana"><BR>
<BR>
After a victory will notice the corpse of your foe sprawled out
on the ground. You will want to collect loot from the corpse (if
any) as soon as possible for two reasons. First of all, corpses
of low level creatures don't last long and if you dally around
it may disappear. Also, you may also end up with another fight
on your hands, whether you are ready or not, if you stay in the
hostile area too long.<BR>

  <P><CENTER><I><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana">TIP:
  as much as any of us hate for it to happen, you will die sooner
  or later in this game. Most of the time you will know exactly
  where you were. But, there will be those times when you got turned
  around while out looking at the sites or you just fled the wrong
  way in a panic. What I try to always do if I know death is inevitable
  is to use the command &quot;/loc&quot; before I die. That way
  I will know the exact coordinates of my corpse and will not have
  to rely on someone else to stumble across it for me or just happen
  to find it out of dumb luck. I'm not sure if I like this command
  being in the game as it takes something away from the gaming
  experience and there have been several debates about it. But,
  as long as it is available to me I am going to use it. It is
  your choice if you wish to do the same.</FONT></I></CENTER>
</UL>

<P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#f8f8ff" SIZE="-1" FACE="verdana"><BR>
As you kill a few things, your inventory may begin to fill up
with the loot you have collected from the corpses (or so you hope).
I recommend that you always go sell before you get to full or
you run the risk of having to leave something on the ground for
someone else to collect. The best time to do this is after a difficult
fight because your health will be low and you can get your selling
done while you recover. After you sell the loot, stop by the bank
and deposit those coins you just made.<BR>
<BR>
After a few trips you will probably have enough to start buying
things. What you choose to buy should be dependent on your class.
A magic user would not want to buy a sword for example, and a
warrior surely can't use a spell. Purchase things that will help
your class the most. Pay attention to the message area as well.
People often sell their used items (which in the game is just
as good as a new one) or items they have found or made for prices
far lower than you can purchase them for from a vendor.<BR>
<BR>
As your character gets equipped better and you gain a level or
two you will notice how easy the creatures are that gave you fits
before and eventually you will not even gain experience points
from them. That is a good warning sign that you have out stayed
your welcome in the newbie area under the protection of guards
and that it is time to move on. This is the time when grouping
becomes a real game factor and the fun really begins. I'll discuss
these things in a future paper sometime, but for now I must go.
<BR>
<BR>
I wish you all excellent gaming adventures and good health. God
bless.<BR>
