<P>Blood clouded his eyes, and his legs hung useless. The froglok
had been darting in and out so much, but now paused to watch the
crumpled figure at his feet: A shinny mess of elf, no weapons,
but unlike a monk so awkward in how he moved, especially in death
throws. The only thing this elf held, at once seeming to gleam
a glowing jet black, the next instant invisible. Yet all it was,
not some magical dagger, but a horn, all it was was an ordinary
horn. Roop was very hot indeed, not just his bleeding wounds,
but that ringmail chafing his armpits and legs, that never-ending
&quot;it's new and needs to be broken-in&quot; subtle irritation,
that's all he felt, nothing worse.... The boots and mantle were
new to him: fine dwarven ringmail, with a blue-black appearance
that could dazzle ordinary light into platinum. The rest, perhaps
not antique and far cheaper, was not to be scoffed at either--fine
bands of deep gray plate, forged in the trees of Kelethin herself.
No light reflected on the banded, yet Roop was oft to dart in
and out of shadows anyway. Lying there like that, a rare instant
sent the smell of his boots up to him, the pungent odor from the
dwarf and previous owner. The worst thing one could smell before
one died: Dwarf feet. Roop even smiled at this. Roop Tugged on
his mantle, rolling his black eyes. Though they wore the same
size, Roop was a good deal larger than a dwarf, being Woodsmen
Elf. He respected the forest like a deity, and drew his power
from his more tricky relatives: The Pixies. However, no matter
how hard he concentrated on pixies, he still somehow felt to large
squirming there in the cold linoleum of the aqueduct. So small,
how crazy to think of pixies as he died. Roop did not care any
longer, and he did the only thing he ever really loved: He played.
'Twas a sad song, her story, about his lost pubescent love, Belindra,
to the plague she and rats her body went, but her liver and heart
was still with Roop: No matter, was completely instrumental this
time, but sad, so sad. The frog ripped into Roop's flesh in frenzy,
almost it seemed, to a new crazed rhythm of the song fleeting
from his horn. But the horn only bleated then blared in a scream
as his legs were confetti: a wet spray of defeat across his eyelids.
Pain and His Sister shock arrived, for Roop became like a gnomish
automaton, unable to even think! Blopblob only care Roop's crazed
whistling, but this BlopBlob ignore like any death shriek. But
them something happen bunch make Blobplob stop. Blobplob smell
human-small and that not it. Human-small bad but smell Blobplob
gud like. Gud Blobplob feel. Human-small not human at all, that
it! Human-small almost seem like eternal Bribbane the frog-legged,
the Divine. YES!! Like the story of Bribbane first coming to land,
a slow scouring across the sand. Blobplob urinated and smiled,
watched the God crawl a long time, and once he saw, it caught
in the light and he almost saw a Minotaurs Horn. But there no
Minotaurs here: Blobplob imagining things.</P>

<P><B><U>How to get the best from a Mailing List:</U></B><BR>
OK I've been getting posts from several people on the content
of emails, here are a few ideas to use.<BR>
1. Set up you onelist account to receive digest instead of every
email, it is slower but you only get one or two a day.<BR>
2. When replying to a post only repeat the part of the original
message that pertains to what you are saying<BR>
3. This is a message board about Bards, you may say whatever you
wish and posting about a guild or person is a good way to let
others of our profession know about something ahead of time.<BR>
4. No I will not ban someone from the list unless they are being
totally uncouth.<BR>
Thank You, Toren L.</P>

<P><B><U>The Beginnings of a Bard:</U></B><BR>
March 14th, 3172 <BR>
I finally did it! I told Mother that it was time for me to join
my elven brethren, packed my bag and left for Qeynos. It was a
long walk from our secluded village, some where I never truly
felt at home. And Qeynos! It's almost too different to describe!
Let me back up a little, tell you how I came to get here. <BR>
My name is Torenithus. I have no true sir name, my profession
has labeled me Legendmaker. I never knew my father, He was a human,
that I'm sure, because I'm only half-elven. Mother refuses to
tell me anything about him, so I'm hoping that eventually I will
find him Since my mother's people treated me with at best indifference
I felt I should travel to the human lands. I'd long heard tales
of the fabulous Bards Guild in Qeynos, and since I have ever loved
singing, it is easier to make friends, so that seemed the only
logical choice. Our village patriarch was eager enough to write
me a letter of recommendation, which she told me to take Trevor
in the Bards Guild in Qeynos. <BR>
I was here, and was it ever scary! Qeynos is huge, everywhere
I went there were people running around, selling stuff and chatting
like it was nothing to have so many people in one place. <BR>
Conquering my fears, I walked up to one of the local merchants
and asked the way to the Bards Guild. He directed me down many
paths and around quite a few turns. I quickly became lost and
as many are apt to do, I soon found out. So I started asking people
I met if they knew the way to the guild house but I was almost
totally ignored. I cant believe a town with so many people and
none of them willing to help out a lost soul. I was growing accustomed
to the animosity I had not expected, apparently my elven side
made these humans distrust me as much as my human side disgusted
my elven clan. Finally while singing a tune by a rather large
lake, imagine my surprise a lake inside of a town, a kindly man
asked me if I needed some help. With a quick hello I told him
what I was searching for and he asked me to follow him. I must
admit I grew nervous at this ( I feared an ambush ). He led me
straight to a house and told me I would find what I needed inside.
As I thanked he smiled and raised his drumstick in a salute! He
was a Bard! <BR>
Shaking my head I headed into the house to search out the person
I was intent on finding. I greeted Trevor and thus began my new
life as a bard.<BR>

<H4><CENTER>Joining the Bard's Guild</CENTER></H4>

<P><CENTER>The primary restriction on joining the Bard's Guild
is in who may become one. Only Wood Elves, Half-elves and Humans
may join the Bard's Guild. Once you've chosen what race to play,
be sure to assign your extra points to whatever attributes you
deem important. <BR>
While it would seem that a Bard's strength may lie in his charisma
and ability to impress others, that is not the only prime requisite
in this guild. Bards must also be fit and swift, so Strength and
Dexterity are also important to a Bard. Other than those three,
it is up to the individual Bard to decide what is important. <BR>
Humans who join the Bard's Guild may start in either Freeport
or Qeynos, while Wood Elves must start in the forest city of Kelethin.
Half-elves, enjoying the best of both worlds, may start in any
one of the three towns. <BR>
Regardless of which town you start in, it's important to locate
your guild and turn your letter over to your guildmaster. Once
you've done this, and received a guild tunic, and small token
experience bonus, you can begin on your life of adventuring as
a Bard. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Early Adventuring</B><BR>
The most important thing to remember as a beginning Bard is that
you are NOT a tank. Bards do not gain many hit points, and without
spells to back you up, you will be quite weak in the beginning.
Take it slowly, and carefully, and try not to worry if you die.,
just get back to your corpse, restock, and jump back into it.
Rats, small snakes, wolves and skeletons all seem to be local
to the three starting towns for Bards. All of these make good
beginner-kills, and most carry some kind of loot, which can be
sold for additional profit, and believe me, you'll need every
copper. <BR>
Unlike spellcasters, Bards do not start with any songs - you must
earn the money for your first (and subsequent) songs. This means
a lot of adventuring, or even Questing. Beginning Bards in Qeynos
have the advantage of two Quests originating in the Bard's Guild,
one for beginners, and one for someone slightly more experienced.
Kelethin adventurers can take up Sylia's Quest, which requires
level 3 or so, while as near as I can tell, Freeport residents
are left out in the cold, Quest-wise. Regardless of how you go
about it, it's important to be well prepared for your adventuring.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Equipping the Bard</B><BR>
Bards suffer few limitations on weapons and armor, being able
to wear even the heaviest of plate, and wield nearly any weapon,
except for bows and a few others. This significant advantage means
that the only hard part is finding something in your size. Since
Bards can carry a shield, it's a good idea to get one as soon
as you can. Later in your adventures, you will need to carry several
instruments, so carrying capacity WILL be an issue. Backpacks,
sacks and boxes are good to acquire, in addition to other important
necessities. Elven and Half-elven Bards can get around the need
for light for the most part, giving them a significant advantage
over their Human brethren. If you are playing a Human, I recommend
picking up a fire-beetle eye as soon as is convenient. They don't
weigh much and don't have to be held to work. Finding a good weapon
is also critical to success as a Bard. Fortunately, many creatures,
such as skeletons and orcs, carry weapons which you can pick up
and use, after relieving the previous owner of them, of course.
Although these weapons are rusty, they can be sharpened, slightly
improving the attack speed. Many towns have people offering to
sharpen weapons, or you might even wish to take up blacksmithing
on your own. Either way, some recommended weapons for <BR>
<BR>
<B>beginning bards: </B><BR>
&middot; Worn Great Staff - Good damage, slow speed. Not sharpenable.
Two-handed. <BR>
&middot; Longsword - My personal favorite, it has good damage,
slightly better speed than a staff, and is only one-handed. <BR>
&middot; Scimitar - Faster than a longsword, this one-hander does
a little less damage. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Later Adventuring</B><BR>
The Bard at higher levels, although capable of soloing, is still
really designed for group travel. Most of the songs and skills
a Bard gains are of benefit when in a larger party, and although
this might mean gaining experience slower, the reduced incidence
of death makes it all worthwhile. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Skills</B><BR>
One of the greatest assets an experienced Bard can bring to a
party is the variety of skills and abilities the Bard can learn
over time. In addition to the skills listed below, Bards are granted
all of the trade skills (Baking, Brewing, Tailoring, Blacksmithing,
Jewel Crafting, Fletching, and Pottery), at first level, and additional
languages at higher levels. <BR>

<P><CENTER><B>Final notes</B><BR>
The Bard has the potential to be one of the most interesting character
classes to play in EverQuest, combining some of the skills that
are more unusual and spell-like abilities of several classes.
Although the Bard is not intended to ever be the master of any
one thing, his all-around usefulness makes him an invaluable ally,
and a fun character to play.<BR>
