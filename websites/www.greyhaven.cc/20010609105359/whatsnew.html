Alliance with Evolutia Prime and Clan Bashemded is working out better than we
could have hoped. In order to help the Alliance grow even more a new Forum has
been created for all 3 guilds to communicate. Check out the Alliance Forum! The
Link is right under the Guild Forum Link, and a Password for the members section
of the Alliance Forum is posted in our Guild Members Section. The new forum is
under construction so monitor it frequently for new features.</font></p>
