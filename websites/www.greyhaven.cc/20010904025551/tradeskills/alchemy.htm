  <p><b><span class="headers">An Introduction to Alchemy - by</span> <a class="header" href="mailto:niami@eqtraders.com">Shavanna
  Spiritdancer </a><span class="headers">(Tunare Server)</span></b></p>
  <p>I am a shamaness, a spiritdancer, from the frozen northlands. Over the
  years, the spirits have spoken to me of many things, but one of the more
  interesting and unique things they have taught me is the magic of herbs and
  potions.</p>
  <p>With the knowledge granted by the spirits, as well as the proper herbs, a
  shaman of 25 trainings or more can mix powerful potions with the use of a <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/alchemy.htm">medicine
  bag</a>. The resultant potions have a variety of uses, from the popular
  &quot;Blood of the Wolf&quot; potion which grants the imbiber the Spirit of
  the Wolf, to the &quot;Ants Potion&quot; that will shrink the drinker,
  regardless of their location. Some grant a fleeting strength, others
  invisibility to undead, or a blistering damage shield. The very skilled elder
  shaman can even create potions that will gate the drinker to a specific
  location.</p>
  <p>Most of these herbs must be painstakingly collected and prepared in order
  to retain their magical properties. Only a few souls have remembered the
  proper collection and preparation techniques. Because of this, herbs you find
  on your own in the wild do not work. Instead, you must seek out certain <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/location/alchemy.htm">skilled
  herbalists</a> to obtain the wares needed. Be forewarned, their wares are not
  cheap, and this skill is not for the faint-of-heart, or the empty of pocket.</p>
  <p>The spirits are also sparing in thier knowledge, and limit your rate of
  skill increase based on your level of learning (i.e., there is a level cap to
  this skill). Apparently too much power in the hands of the untrained can be
  dangerous, and lead to disastrous side-effects.</p>
  <p>Once you have learned how to create potions using your newfound skill, you
  may find yourself afloat in potions that do not pack together nicely. Again,
  the spirits have seen to our needs. Tailors may make bearskin potion bags from
  the pelts of grizzlies, using strong silk thread to stich and bind it. These
  potion bags, can be used to combine 5 or 10 of the <b>same potion</b> together
  to create a single multiple-charge potion. This currently only works for
  potions made by a shaman, not store-purchased potions, but the combining in
  the potion bag can be performed by anyone.</p>
  <p>At times, you may find that your alchemical skill will be called upon to
  create extracts for <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_dyes.htm">armor
  dyes</a> as well, though you'll find that if your alchemy skill is weak,
  you'll end up wasting the components instead of making a colorful extract.</p>
