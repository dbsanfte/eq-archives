  <p><i>(Note: This mini-article will be updated with new information on <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_fishing.htm">fishing
  lures</a>, as well as with details on how to fish from moving boats, in the
  near future)</i></p>
  <p>Fishing is <b>the</b> easiest trade skill to master and the quickest one to
  turn a profit. It also has the added benefit of being the only trade skill you
  can avoid spending training points on, and still be able to keep your
  learning/profit margin in the managable ranges.</p>
  <p>Fishing can keep you fed. Fishing can earn you coins enough to buy those
  spells or supplies you need in order to practice your more difficult/costly
  trade skills.</p>
  <p>I highly recommend that everyone learn how to fish at one point or another,
  unless you've found the secret to independent wealth!</p>
  <p>What do you need in order to fish? A fishing pole, some bait, a couple open
  inventory spots in order to transport your booty to the nearest shopkeeper,
  and a stream/river/lake or ocean to fish in. The pole will cost you over 2
  gold, and it can/will break on you at some point, so be prepared for the need
  to replace it. The bait will cost you a few copper per bait, and you'll need
  at least one bait per fish you hope to catch.</p>
  <p>Make sure when you are trying to fish that your pole is held in your melee
  weapon hand, that you're standing/sitting at the edge of the water, and facing
  the water. (You can also meditate while fishing, as long as you've equipped
  the pole in advance, and are sitting on the shoreline.) Then just cast your
  line and wait for the fish to bite. Cast. Wait. Cast. Wait. Eventually, you
  should catch ... something. Remember that I mentioned something about
  &quot;booty&quot;? Yep, that's right. There's more than just fish available in
  the water. You can sometimes find fish scales and other oddities snagged on
  your hook. Don't throw them away, as you can sell them to any (NPC) merchant
  to add to your slowly growing profits. As you continue to fish, your fishing
  skill should improve.</p>
  <p>When I had a couple hours of fishing under my belt, and about 20 ranks in
  fishing, I made a profit of over 6 gold in half an hour. It's still a slow way
  to make money, but its relaxing and you're unable/unwilling to hunt, it's a
  great way to earn some money.</p>
  <p>When you're done fishing for the day, stow that fishing pole and some bait
  (or some extra coins) in the bank. You never know when you're going to end up
  with your corpse on one continent, and yourself on another continent with no
  gear, and no way to get to your corpse without food and money. Being able to
  run to the bank and fish your way into food and coins can make all the
  difference in the world.</p>
