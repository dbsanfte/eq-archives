    information.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS">DISCUSSION FORUM- This is our message board
    section. Areas include general discussion, officer's forum, biographies,

OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS THERE HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC OUTBREAK IN SECONDARY CHARACTERS. SOME PEOPLE SAY THEY GOT BORED, OTHERS
 SAY THEY WERE TIRED OF DIEING AND GOING NO WHERE BUT BACKWARDS. YET OTHERS CLAIM.... <I>"IT IS AN ADDICTION"</I> THESE
PEOPLE SAY THEY CANNOT HELP BUT TO HAVE AS MANY CHARACTERS AS POSSIBLE.
<P> IS THIS A HARMLESS ACTIVITY? OR IS IT A HIDDEN SIGN OF SCHIZOPHRENIA MAKING IT'S PRESENCE KNOWN THROUGH EQ ALTS?
<P>I FOR ONE CAN'T SAY, FOR I TOO HAVE SUCCUMBED TO THE ALT WAVE, I HAVE PLAYED 23 DIFFERENT CHARACTERS OVER 4 DIFFERENT SERVERS
AND STILL HAVE 11 CHARACTERS ACTIVE. MY MAIN CHARACTER IS LEVEL 36 AND HAS OVER 50 HOURS PLAYTIME, HE MONOPOLIZES THE
MAJORITY
OF MY EQ LIFE. BUT SOMETIMES I JUST LIKE TO TAKE A BREAK AND GO BACK TO THE SIMPLICITY OF KILLING SPIDERS AND SNAKES, AND WALKING 
IN FEAR OF LIONS, TIGERS AND BEARS. YOU ALL KNOW THIS ERA OF EQ, IT IS THE ERA OF LEVELLING. I ALSO HAVE ALTS THAT I MAINTAIN
AT LOWER LEVELS TO PLAY WHEN FRIENDS ARE ON LINE WHO CANNOT GROUP WITH MY MAIN CHARACTER. AND OCCASIONALLY I PLAY ONE OF MY ALTS
WITH THE INTENTION OF SIMPLY MEETING A CERTAIN GOAL OR COMPLETING A SPECIFIC QUEST WITH THAT CHARACTER. BUT THEN OF COURSE THERE
IS THE OTHER REASON I PLAY MY ALTS. I LIKE PLAYING THEM.  (SMILES)

VEESHAN THE GREAT CRYSTALINE DRAGON MARKED NORRATH BY STRIKING THE CONTINENT OF VELIOUS WITH HER FORECLAW, AND THEN WITH
HER ICY BREATH CREATED A MIGHTY ICE BARRIER, SEGRAGATING VELIOUS FROM THE REST OF NORRATH. VELIOUS IS THE HOME OF THE DRAGONS 
AND YES THERE WILL BE LOTS OF THEM. IN FACT THERE WILL EVEN BE SPIRITS OF DRAGONS LONG DEAD. BUT THEY ARE NOT ALONE, THEY ARE AT
WAR WITH THE GREATEST CREATIONS OF RALLOS ZEK. THE STORM GIANTS. SO CHOOSE YOUR SIDE, FIGHT WITH THE MIGHTY DRAGONS, OR CHOOSE TO FIGHT ALONG
SIDE THE GIANTS AND BE A SLAYER OF DRAGONS!
<BR> 
HERE IS A GLIMPSE OF JUST ONE SUCH DRAGON AND A STORM GIANT. I COULD SHOW YOU MORE, BUT THAT WOULD SPOIL ALL OF THE FUN. HEHEHE.

THIS WEEK I HAVE A SPECIAL TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION. MOST PEOPLE HAVE HEARD RUMORS OF A NEW CREATURE OF LITTLE KNOWN INFORMATION.
THE EVER FAMOUS TWINKIE! A MONSTER OF GREAT POWER AND GROWING IN NUMBERS EVERY DAY. I PERSONALLY CAN FIND NO WRITTEN REFERENCE
TO THIS STRANGE CREATURE OF LEGENDARY PROPORTION. SOME SAY IT DOES NOT EXIST. WHILE OTHERS SAY, THEY ARE EVIL DOPPELGANGERS
HIDING AMONGST US AND THEIR NUMBER GROWS EVERY DAY. SO I WENT OUT INTO NORRATH AND SPOKE WITH THE PEOPLE. HERE ARE SOME OF THINGS
I HEARD WHEN ASKING ABOUT <I><B>THE TWINKIE!</B></I>
<P> FINGERFIRE ASSALT - ERUDITE WIZARD - LEV 32
<BR>"Twinkies!" (shivers) Devastating creatures, I pride myself in my ability to judge the strength of others, but these...
these Twinkies. They are nightmares dressed as the Candy man. They look Harmless enough, like children just learning there ways.
BUT! It is a game of Cloak and Dagger, for they are very dangerous and growing in power and numbers faster than anything in Norrath's History."
<p> GUMMIE BAYR - OGRE WARRIOR - LEV 47
<br>"Twinkies?" (stop for a second as if slowly loading information) He He Gummie lyk Twinkees, Dais is good Snacks, He He"
<p> IINSTYN CAPYRNIKIS - GNOME MAGICIAN - LEV 59
<BR>(LAUGHING)"Twinkies are nothing more than young pathetic adventureres who have acquired great artifacts from
their Ancestors, they are only dangerous if they dont know what to do with their good fortunes."(LAUGHS again)"Harmless."
<p>WELL THERE YOU GO, HEHEHE. DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION? IF SO POST YOUR THOUGHTS ON OUR PUBLIC DISCUSSION FORUM AT <A HREF="http://WWW.GreyHaven.CC" TARGET="_NEW"><font color="BLUE">WWW.GreyHaven.CC</font color></a>
