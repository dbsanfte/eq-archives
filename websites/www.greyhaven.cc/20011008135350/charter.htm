<font face="Comic Sans MS">

friends. And above ALL ELSE lets have FUN!"</font> </i></center>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" >Respect your fellow guild members. And give
    all non members the respect they are
    due.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" >Always act in a respectable way to represent the guild properly.
    No whining, begging, calling others names, KS-ing, shouting obscenities, etc.&nbsp;
    This includes Guild Chat. Respect for your fellow players is above all
    else a must.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" > Play nice policy (PNP).&nbsp; Verant has incorporated this into their policies. Everyone in this game is a paying customer.&nbsp;
    This is a
    recreational activity and no one should do anything to ruin it for someone
    else.&nbsp; Don't treat anyone how you wouldn't want to be treated yourself.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" >Any items you get are yours.&nbsp; What you choose to do with them is your choice. If lent an item, please agree upon a return time beforehand and
    return it when the time comes. We all work hard for the things we get, so it is our privilege to decide how we distribute them.&nbsp;
    Of course anything you decide
    to give to the guild is welcome, so we have more to distribute to members
    and friends.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" >Try to make sure your <font color="#008000"> /ooc</font> comments are in
    <font color="#008000"> /ooc</font> and not <font color="#FF0000">/shout</font>, etc; ie, not shouting about your computer, et al.&nbsp; This will help to keep the role-playing aspect of the game more pure.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" > Register with the <a href="http://pub8.ezboard.com/bgreyhavenguild"> bulletin board</a>
    on our site, and monitor and post
    often.&nbsp; Communication is of the <b> utmost</b> importance to the success of the
    guild. All members should at minimum monitor the Raid Forums and the
    Calendar. Those who obtain the position of Officer should additionally
    monitor the Officers Forum on a regular basis.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" >Failure to comply with the guild charter may result
    in a warning, followed by immediate removal from the guild if the warning is
    not heeded.&nbsp; Officers have the authority to /guildremove anyone they feel
    that is showing a blatant disregard for guild rules.</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" >Try to attend all guild gatherings, they occur
    every 4-6 weeks.&nbsp; This
    is a time where we can gather and enjoy each other's company.&nbsp; It's also a
    time to discuss important guild news.&nbsp; We also tend to have raids after our
    gatherings.&nbsp; Once the official meeting time has
    commenced, disruptions of the gatherings will not be tolerated (ie NO
    Duels/Pets/Shouts/Casting/Etc unless in Self-Defense).&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" > Last and most important one: <b> <font color="#FF0000"> Have Fun</font></b>.&nbsp; This is a game and we should
    enjoy ourselves while playing. Greyhaven's goal is to be an Uber Family,
    this means we get to know each other, we group together, we have fun
    together, we have bad nights together, we become Friends.</font></li>
