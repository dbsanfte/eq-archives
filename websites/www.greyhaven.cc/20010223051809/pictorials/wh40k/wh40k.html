<P>DAY ONE
<P>It took over 4 hours to set up the Game table, and the pre game Events tables
took another 4 hours to get through. Then to add Insult to Injury it took
another 3 hours to get through the Pregame Army Special Attacks.&nbsp; The
Vortex Marines finally got a chance to start the first turn after loosing tons
of men, and several tanks to pregame Events. But as if to spite them, the
terrain was unforgiving, almost Immobilizing the entire Army and making there
first turn very short. In fact as they were soon to find out, the Psychic phase
and H to H phase were going to turn out to be the most feared part of this
battle. Why? Because in these 2 phases both Armys get to go on both turns.
<P>DAY TWO
<P>The Tyrranids finally get to take there Offical First Turn. Initially it was
fast, Tyrranids dont get much in the way of Ranged Attack. But then the H to H
and Psychic Phases proved to be Allies. Giving the Tyrranids a powerful and Ugly
Attack.&nbsp;
<P>Vortex Marines take their Second Turn, this time trying to shoot at anything
even remotely in range of their guns, still plagued by Terrain keeping them
fairly Immobile. Again teh Psychic Phase and H to H phase proofed to be in the
Tyrranids favor.
<P>The Tyrranids take there Second turn, moving quickly across the terrain
unencumbered by Weapons and closing the Gap between the armies. Now within
reach, the Tyrranids get to use there Strengths in the Psychic and H to H
phases.
<P>DAY THREE<P>Its Sunday and both players are tired and probably wishing they
had played smaller Armies. The Vortex Marines take their 3rd Turn, this time
breaking the terrains hold and gettting some much Needed Firepower to the front.
This was to prove to be the best Turn for the Marines as they openned fire with
vast numbers of Assault Cannons, Las Cannons, and Plasma Grenades. But again the
Psychic phase and H to H phase were to prove devistating.<P>The Tyrranids
proceeded to the movement phase, but it was getting to be late and it was a
Sunday Night. The Vortex Marines Commander Darth Willey (John) declared the
Tyrranid Army Victorious and the Combatants begun the clean up process.&nbsp;<P>Although
outnumbered nearly 2 to 1 the Tyrranid Army pulled off a Victory in this Battle,
Superior Psychic Abilities, and using Terrain as there Ally gave them the
Advantage just long enough to get the Victory. The Vortex Marines although
sporting Vastly Superior Fire Power were left nearly helpless for their first
turn while trying to find a way through the Unrelenting Terrain. By the time The
Space Marine Army was in a position to really do some Harm to the quickly
approaching Tyrranid Swarm, it was to late, out of time the Battle was called to
a Halt.<P>John (Darth) Willey has called for a Rematch, but this time the
Cautious Commander promises that the Evil Tyrranid Force will not find Allys in
the surrounding terrain.<P>&nbsp;<P>BELOW is a 60 Pic Pictorial of the Battle,
over 200 pics were taken , but even to show 60 they had to be shown fairly small
and cannot be enlarged. We hope everyone enjoys the Pics, and the short story
about the battle.
