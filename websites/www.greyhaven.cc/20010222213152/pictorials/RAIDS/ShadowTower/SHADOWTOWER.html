THE TOWER OF SHADOWS IS THE VELLIOUS VERSION OF BEFALLEN. INHABITED BY GHOST, GOLEMS, MUMMYS, AND VAMPIRES THIS TOWER PROVES
TO BE A CHALLENGE AND QUITE DEADLY. ON THE SECOND FLOOR YOU FIND A LIBRARY WITH GHOST TEACHERS, GHOST LIBRARIANS, AND GHOST, 
GHOST, AND MORE GHOST. EACH FLOOR REQUIRES YOU TO GET A SPECIAL KEY THAT UNLOCKS THE MAGICAL POWERS OF A MIRROR THAT WILL LET
YOU STEP THROUGH TO THE NEXT FLOOR. AND THE KEY HOLDER IS NEVER EASY.&nbsp;
<p> THE 4TH FLOOR FINDS YOU FIGHTING SEVERAL NAMED MUMMYS AND
EVEN AN ARMORED SHADOW WHO HARMTOUCHES FOR 1200 PTS! THE&nbsp; KEYHOLDER IS A NASTY LOOKING FEMALE MUMMY WHO IS A LEVEL 42 CLERIC. 
ALONE SHE PROVES TO BE DEADLY FOR ENTIRE GROUPS OF EQUAL LEVEL. ONCE YOU ACQUIRE THE KEY TO THE 5TH FLOOR YOU FIND YOURSELF AT
A MUMMY WEDDING THAT IS REPLAYED THROUGHOUT ETERNITY. THERE ARE AT LEAST 20 NAMED MUMMYS IN THIS ROOM TO INCLUDE THE PRIEST , 
BRIDE, GROOM, BRIDESMAIDS, AND EVERYONE ELSE YOU WOULD NORMALLY SEE AT A WEDDING.&nbsp;</p>
<p> ON THE 6TH FLOOR YOU GET TO MEET AN EVIL
GENIE WHO IS AT LEAST LEVEL 45. HIS ROOM IS GUARDED BY LEVEL 40 VAMPIRE BATS. UPON KILLING THESE FOUL CREATURES THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY
REPLACED WITH FRENZIED VAMPIRES RANGING FROM LEVEL 41 TO LEVEL 43. WHO HARMTOUCH THE SLAYER OF
THEIR BAT FORM. ON THE 7TH FLOOR IS A FEMALE VAMPIRE WHO IS SURROUNDED BY FROST
FAMILIARS, SHADOW FAMILIARS,
EMERALD FAMILIARS, BLOOD FAMILIARS, AND A BUNCH OF ANIMATED TORCHES. UPON ENTERING THE ROOM IT LOOKS LIKE THE TORCHES
ARE DECORATIONS ON THE WALLS, AND THEN THEY ATTACK!</p>
<P>BELOW ARE PICTURES OF SOME&nbsp; THINGS YOU CAN ENCOUNTER WHILE IN THIS DUNGEON. BESIDE EACH PICTURE IS A SHORT DESCRIPTION
OF THE CREATURE, ITS LEVEL, AND WHAT IT DROPS.
