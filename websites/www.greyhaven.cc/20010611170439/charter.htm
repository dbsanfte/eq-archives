<br><center><b><i>&quot;Lets develop GreyHaven as a skill-based, guide-oriented, example-setting, group of
friends. And above ALL ELSE lets have FUN!" </i></b></center>
<br>
<br><center>That being said, on to the unfortunate part of having to place some basic rules of conduct.</font></center>
</font>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">1. Respect your fellow guild members. And give
    all non members the respect they are
    due.</font></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">2. Always act in a respectable way to represent the guild properly.
    No whining, begging, calling others names, KSing, shouting obscenities, etc.</font></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">3. Play nice policy. (PNP) EQ
    has incorporated this into their policies. Everyone in this game is a paying customer. This is a
    recreational activity and no one should do anything to ruin it for someone
    else. Don't treat anyone how you wouldn't want to be treated yourself.</font></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">4. Our guild has every race and every class represented. We can set the example for not only
    other players, but for
    other guilds.</font></li>
  <li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">5. Any items you get are yours,
    what you choose to do with them is your choice. If lent an item, please agree upon a return time beforehand and
    return it when the time comes. We all work hard for the things we get, so it is our privilege to decide how we distribute them. Of course anything you decide
    to give to the guild is welcome, so we have more to distribute to members
    and friends.</font></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">6. Try to make sure your /ooc comments are in /ooc and not
    /shout, etc; ie, not shouting about your computer, et al.&nbsp; This will help to keep the role-playing aspect of the game more pure.</font></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">7. Register with the bulletin board on our site, and monitor and post
    often.&nbsp; Communication is of the utmost importance to the success of the
    guild.</font></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">8. Failure to comply with the guild charter may result
    in a warning, followed by immediate removal from the guild if the warning is
    not heeded. Officers have the authority to /guildremove anyone they feel
    that is showing a blatant disregard for guild rules.</font></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">9. Try to attend all guild gatherings, they occur
    every 4-6 weeks.&nbsp; This
    is a time where we can gather and enjoy each other's company. It's also a
    time to discuss important guild news. We also tend to have raids after our
    gatherings. Once the official meeting time has
    commenced, disruptions of the gatherings will not be tolerated (ie NO
    Duels/Pets/Shouts/Casting/Etc unless in Self-Defense).&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#FFFFFF">10. Last and most important one: <b> Have Fun</b>.&nbsp; This is a game and we should
    enjoy ourselves while playing.</font></li>
</ul>
