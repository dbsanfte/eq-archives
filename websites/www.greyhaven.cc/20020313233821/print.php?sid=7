    On Friday the 18th and before our Gathering on Saturday we will be doing our traditional AC HUNT. But from now on, there is a new twist. Please show up for this even if you have JBoots. Lets get everyone a pair, and in the mean time, while we are all in So Ro, we have Port access, we can start working on Epic Mini MObs while Hunting the AC! Port out kill a mini mob, port back Hunt the AC until the next mob someone needs to do.
<br />

<br />
Saturday the 19th at Noon PST is our Gathering. I expect everyone to be in So Ro before noon, usually we aim for an hour ahead of time, to BS and do things like trade Languages. But this shouldnt be a problem since everyone will already be there Friday  
<br />

<br />
Start taking notes on some of your smaller Epic encounters , make sure you know who what when where and how, and we will start getting some of these things started.  <br><br>
