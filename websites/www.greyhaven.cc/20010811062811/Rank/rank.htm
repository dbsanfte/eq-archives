      sort. Within these Armies there was
a structure. Rank and Insignia actually started within Religious Cults. Being extremely Chaotic in Nature these vast
      hordes needed
 a way to control internal turmoil.</font>
<P> <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#C0C0C0"> Originally the use of an insignia was a customary practice of vain religious
leaders who wore vast amounts of jewelry to
show everyone their superiority. Eventually this became a common method of showing honor
and pride for ones personal rank. In recent times this practice has taken on a formal approach using standard
insignias
to represent ranks within an Army.</font><P><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#C0C0C0">The name GreyHaven itself is a 2 part
      symbolic word of historical meaning dating back to the beginning of time. 
Grey is an ancient religious Color representing a balance of all things. White,
      representing purity of essence and the combination of all colors
      signifying a vibrant soul; and Black, representing complete corruption of
      essence and a void of colors signifying the darkness of the soul.. Haven is an age old word meaning
      protected place and signifies
Neutral Ground where all are respected and can rest Safely.</font>
<P><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#C0C0C0">Our Guild has carried this tradition into its very Charter and Own Rank Structure giving each Rank a significant Color
and Insignia, so that all Members <i>(be they Human, Elf, Dwarf, Ogre, or any other race)</i> 
can wear their given Rank
with Honor and Pride.</font><p>
<hr>
      <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#C0C0C0">
Guild Councils - These Councils will be volunteer for the most part and consist of no more than 6 members per council. 
A Council Leader will be appointed by the Guild Leader and the Officers of
Greyhaven and chosen from those volunteers.</font><p> 
<font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#C0C0C0"> 
Additionally the officer Ranks will maintain a structure of 6. There will be a Captain&nbsp;
for every 6 Disciples and a Commander for every 6 Captains. The Ranks of Knight
, Lord, and Lady are Special Ranks to symbolize your time and status with
Greyhaven.</font>
