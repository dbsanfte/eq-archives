</p>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">On the Making of Arrows</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">In order to make arrows or bows, you must have:</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">A supply of cash.<br>
  A fletching kit.<br>
  the correct components.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">I would also recommend getting and reading the books on arrow and
  bowmaking, as they are cheap and have good info in them.&nbsp; What components
  do you need, you ask?&nbsp; Well, forget about bows for now.&nbsp; I did not
  make my first simple hickory recurve bow until skill level 30+, and even then
  I was failing more than succeeding.&nbsp; For making arrows (and you will sit
  in a quiet corner for endless hours making literally hundreds of arrows to get
  good at this skill)&nbsp; you need 4 basic components:</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">A bunch of arrow point.&nbsp; There are 3 different types:&nbsp; field
  points (6 cp each), hooked points (several silver each), and bladed (several
  gold each).&nbsp; A bundle of arrow shafts...again, there are several types:&nbsp;
  wooden (6 cp each), bone (a gp or so), ceramic (a few gold), and steel
  (several gold each). A bunch of fletches...either round cut (6 cp each),
  parabolic cut (a few silver each), or shield cut (a few gold per). And a bunch
  of nocks...large (6 cp), medium (1 sp or so) or small (a few silver).</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">To start with, buy 20 each of the cheapest components...wooden shafts,
  field points, round cut fletches, and large nocks. Now, find a quiet corner,
  and put these items in a container like a bag or backpack.&nbsp; Move one of
  each at a time into your open fletching kit, until you have one of each in
  there, then hit combine.&nbsp; Voila!&nbsp; Most likely you get a red message
  saying you failed, and all your components in the kit disappear, gone forever.&nbsp;
  Do this 19 more times and see how many arrows you get and how much your skill
  goes up.&nbsp; Repeat.&nbsp; Rinse if necessary.&nbsp; Repeat again.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Keep doing this until you get the message that &quot;This item is
  trivial for someone of your skill.&quot;&nbsp; Usually this will happen with
  the 25 cp arrows around skill level 16 or so.&nbsp; This is good.&nbsp; Now,
  go back and buy all the same components, except get MEDIUM nocks instead of
  LARGE.&nbsp; Medium nocks are harder to work with (the more expensive a
  component, the harder it is to make something with), and will raise you skill
  some more.&nbsp; Every time you get that blue &quot;Trivial&quot; message, you
  have to startworking with harder materials...and more expensive ones.&nbsp;
  But remember...you only have to add one component at a time, and you can go
  backwards on some of them.&nbsp; What I mean by that is that a Parabolic Cut
  Fletch is more expensive than a medium nock, so when medium nocked arrows
  become trivial for you, you can go back to large nocks, but change the
  fletching you use.&nbsp; This will still make for a harder arrow, and you will
  save yourself money in the long run.&nbsp; Don't be afraid to experiment.&nbsp;
  Buy a few of the components you think will work, try them out, and see what
  messages you get.&nbsp; If they don't work, you can always sell the components
  back to the merchant.&nbsp; For the cheaper components, they even give you
  close to the full value back (although they give you far less than the total
  value of an item AFTER you have made it).</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The components of the arrows and their effects are listed below.&nbsp;
  This is much more specific than the manuals found in the game, so it's kind of
  a spoiler.&nbsp; You have been warned.&nbsp; If you want to skip ahead to the
  part on bows, do so now.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The shaft of an arrow determines basic damage.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">wooden shaft:&nbsp; dmg 1 arrow.<br>
  bone shaft:&nbsp; dmg 2.<br>
  ceramic shaft:&nbsp; dmg 3.<br>
  steel shaft:&nbsp; ?? (dmg 4, I think.&nbsp; Might be 5 though.)<br>
  The point adds to this damage... field points:&nbsp; no addition. hooked
  points:&nbsp; +1 dmg. bladed points:&nbsp; +2 dmg.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The fletching affects the range of the arrow.&nbsp; Every arrow has a
  base range&nbsp; of 50.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">round cut fletch:&nbsp; no change.<br>
  parabolic cut fletch:&nbsp; +50 range.<br>
  shield cut fletch:&nbsp; +1 damage, SUBTRACTS range (-50, I think).<br>
  wooden vane:&nbsp; +1 damage, -25 range<br>
  bone vane:&nbsp; +1 damage, +25 range<br>
  ceramic vane:&nbsp; +2 damage</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Finally, the nock adds range as well, smaller nocks being more
  aerodynamic.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Large nock:&nbsp; no change.<br>
  Medium nock:&nbsp; +25 rng.<br>
  small nock:&nbsp; +50 rng.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Thus, the basic 25cp bundle of arrows has a damage of 1, and a range of
  50.&nbsp; An arrow with a field point, bone shaft, small nock, and parabolic
  fletch would be damage 2, range 150.&nbsp; Better than the flight arrows they
  sell in the stores, and cheaper too!&nbsp; Just keep experimenting with arrows
  until your skill gets up there.&nbsp; If you don't have customers for arrows,
  and you don't&nbsp; want to waste the expensive ones yourself, then you can
  sell them back to the merchant for about 60-75% of their value, which will
  allow you to keep making more arrows...</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">The Art of the Bowyer.&nbsp; (you can stop scrolling down now if you
  were skipping&nbsp; the &quot;spoiler.&quot;)</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Ok.&nbsp; You've gotten your first 30 or so skill points now, and you
  are bored to tears of making arrows.&nbsp; You want a bow, to shoot those
  arrows out of!&nbsp; Well, my friend, bows are tough to make, and expensive.&nbsp;
  But they are the real reason for having this skill in the first place.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">There are several components available for making bows.&nbsp; The most
  basic requirement is a bow stave, made of some wood.&nbsp; Hickory is the
  simplest and easiest to work with, and also the cheapest.&nbsp; After that
  comes Elm, Ash, Oak, and Darkwood.&nbsp; A hickory bow stave is less than 3gp,
  and Elm is around 3pp, Ash is 18pp or so, Oak is 75 pp, and Darkwood is over
  250pp just for one bow stave!&nbsp; Stick with Hickory for now. Second in
  importance is the string.&nbsp; Only 3 choices here, and all of them&nbsp;
  cost less than 1gp.&nbsp; Hemp, Linen, and Silk, with Hemp being the easiest,
  and silk being the most difficult.&nbsp; String affects the damage and delay
  of the basic bow stave, with hemp being the slowest but most damaging, and
  silk being the fastest and least hard-hitting. There are other components to
  bows as well...planing tools and whittling knives, and cams for making
  compound bows, but all of these are HORRENDOUSLY expensive and should be
  avoided until much later.&nbsp; Forget about them for now.&nbsp; Just stick
  with a bow stave and a string.&nbsp; Buy a hickory bow stave and a length of
  hemp string.&nbsp; Put them both in your fletching kit and hit combine.&nbsp;
  That's it.&nbsp; If your lucky, you'll have a new &quot;rough hickory recurve
  bow.&quot;&nbsp; If not, you'll be out 3gp or so and will have to try again.&nbsp;
  Thats all there is to basic bow making.&nbsp; But because it is so expensive,
  especially when you fail, it is NOT a good way to try to raise your skill.&nbsp;
  Use arrows for that...sit in the proverbial corner making arrows until your
  eyes bleed, and you have a high skill, then go try to make a couple of bows to
  use and sell.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Every bow requires these two components...a stave and string.&nbsp; What
  about planing tools and whittling knives and cams, you ask?&nbsp; You want to
  make finished compound bows?&nbsp; Well, I can tell you what you need to know,
  but my fletching skill is approaching 150, and I have not yet made a compound
  bow.&nbsp; The parts are just too expensive.&nbsp; But this is what I know:&nbsp;
  Hickory bows can only take string.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; No tools or anything
  else. Elm bows can be finished with a whittling knife.&nbsp; You cannot use a
  planing&nbsp; tool on them. Ash (and any better) bows can be finished with
  either a knife OR a planing&nbsp; tool, but not both.&nbsp; I am not sure if
  an Ash bow can have a single cam, two&nbsp; cams, or no cams at all.&nbsp; Not
  much point in putting 45pp cams on an 18pp bow anyway.Oak bows can be cammed,
  but I am not sure if they can take two cams.&nbsp; That&nbsp; would be an
  expensive bow to experiment with too.&nbsp; A basic oak stave is in the
  neighborhood of 75pp, with cams running 45pp+ each, so a failure will hurt.&nbsp;
  Darkwood bows (which cost 250pp just for a stave) can have anything you want
  done to them.&nbsp; There are even rumors of Steel and Ceramic Bow staves, but
  I have never seen such offered for sale.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">As far as which components do what, I have compiled a list (below, much
  like the arrow components above), along with what skill level I would
  recommend&nbsp; you achieve before trying.&nbsp; I will list the skills as
  numbers and slashes, i.e. 30/35/46, which is the skill minimum, the skill
  nominal, and the point at which the bow becomes trivial to make.&nbsp; Note
  that these are conservative figures...better to wait for those few extra
  fletching points before trying something expensive.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Hickory bow staves (30/35/46) are damage 10, range 50, delay 50.<br>
  Elm bow staves (50/55/66) are damage 13, range 75, delay 51.<br>
  Ash bow staves (80+, not trivial for me yet) are damage 16, range 100,
  delay 58.<br>
  Oak bow staves are damage 21, delay 65, range 125.<br>
  Darkwood bow staves are damage 25, delay 68, range 150.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Hemp twine makes the basic bows listed above.&nbsp; Slow, but damaging.<br>
  Linen string gives -1 damage, -4 delay.<br>
  Silk string gives -2 damage, -8 delay.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Whittling knives are -1 damage, -4 delay as well.<br>
  Planing tools are -2 damage, -8 delay to the finished product.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Cams offer a final -1 damage, -5 delay modifier, but shouldn't be used
  unless you have already decided to use silk string and a planing tool.&nbsp;
  Using a cam (or two on a Darkwood bow) without these items is a waste of cash,
  pure and simple.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">From this, it is easy to see that using such combinations as Linen
  string and a knife are a pointless waste of money.&nbsp; Simply using silk
  string gives the same effect.&nbsp; Don't use a knife unless you are already
  using silk.&nbsp; Likewise, don't use a planing tool with hemp twine.&nbsp; Be
  smart about your money.&nbsp; String is dirt cheap, tools are expensive and
  hard to work with.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Thus far we have discussed the making of arrows and basic bows.&nbsp;
  This information will get you easily to a skill level of 100+, if you are
  diligent and practice regularly.&nbsp; At skill level 101, you are considered
  to have mastered a skill, so beyond that, you should have the abilities to
  figure things out for yourself.&nbsp; Your apprenticeship is over.<br>
  &nbsp;</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Marketing.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Where do you sell your bows?&nbsp; Who do you sell them too?&nbsp; How
  much do you sell them for?&nbsp; Well, as mentioned previously, only Rangers,
  Warriors, Rogues, Paladins, and Shadowknights can use bows.&nbsp; Before I
  auction my bows, I use the /who command to see who is in my zone.&nbsp; If
  there aren't at least a few of these classes, or a lot of anonymous people, I
  usually don't bother.&nbsp; I have had several people expess interest in
  buying a bow &quot;for a friend,&quot; but no one has yet done so.&nbsp; I
  guess their friendship isn't worth the platinum I ask for my bows.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">NEVER sell a bow to a merchant.&nbsp; They give you far less than you
  paid for the basic materials.&nbsp; All you will do is lose money.&nbsp; Also,
  although I have occasionally given away a Hickory bow or two (usually to
  friends, once as part of a game for some first level Rangers), I NEVER sell my
  bows for a loss.&nbsp; I spent many hard hours making arrows to get my skill
  where it is at, and much money as well, and bow parts are expensive.&nbsp;
  That is time and money I could have spent earning experience and better
  equipping myself.&nbsp; That time is woth money.&nbsp; If the other person
  cannot or will not acknowledge this, then they don't deserve to carry one of
  my bows.&nbsp; Simple as that.&nbsp; I also charge more if I have to travel
  far, or for custom orders.&nbsp; I only know of 3 places&nbsp; in the world to
  buy bow making supplies, and if I have to travel halfway across the continent
  to hawk my wares, through dangerous terrain, then the price goes up.&nbsp; You
  get what you pay for, and bows are worth the money.&nbsp; Smart players
  realize this.</font>
  <p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">In general, I charge 1pp for a simple hickory bow.&nbsp; 2pp if I have
  to travel a long ways.&nbsp; Elm bows cost me 3-4pp to make, so I sell them
  for 6-7, sometimes more.&nbsp; Ash bows cost nearly 30pp (assuming a 2/3rds
  success rate), so go for correspondingly higher prices.&nbsp; I try to only
  mark my bows up 25%-50%, and I give good deals on arrows (I was making them
  for my skill points anyway, so what the heck...they are only arrows).&nbsp; I
  also frequently trade bows for other equipment.&nbsp; Especially equipment
  that other people have made with THEIR trade skills, such as armor or simple
  magic jewelry.&nbsp; As you are walking about using the /auction command to
  sell your creations, be prepared to answer A LOT of questions.&nbsp;
  &quot;What are the stats on&nbsp; such-and-such bow,&quot; &quot;how much for
  this-and-that,&quot; &quot;how do you make bows,&quot; &quot;what good are
  bows,&quot; and things of that nature.&nbsp; Selling bows and adventuring are
  not compatible, so I do one at a time, usually making time for both during a
  period of play.&nbsp; I might try to sell bows when I first sign on, then go
  adventure for a while, then head back to town to try to sell again before I
  sign off.&nbsp; Seems to work alright for me.&nbsp; Also, don't be afraid to
  advertise custom bows and arrows, and make them to your customers requests.&nbsp;
  Some people like high damage bows, some people like fast bows, some people
  like some combination of the two.&nbsp; Be flexible, and, most of all, be
  prepared to put a lot of your time into the craft if you want to be good.</font></p>
