<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Early in life I learned what it was
to hate. Complete hate that has festered and grown since the fateful day that I
witnessed my father's death. Filthy they are. Filthy and grotesque. Undead is
what I speak of. My father was a brutish man that would often frequent the bars
and visit (on more than one occasion) The Maiden's Fancy. This in itself did not
contribute to his downfall. One day, with me in tow, he decided to visit the
scourge of Norrath, befallen. I was more than a bit nervous as I had seen the
Norrathian seasons turn only eight times and had heard many horror stories of
dark ones going in and never coming out. Unabated by my protests we entered
befallen. The details of the following are sketchy as most of the action was but
a blur to my young, and naive mind. A great fight ensued in the bowels of
befallen. I was ordered by my father to run to the light, to get out while I
could. I ran…I ran like never before. Such a coward! Of course in hind sight
it was just a means to an end, if I would have stayed I would not be able to
carry on the name of the Hillinu's. I can still see my father's tortured face.
Can see my father casting spell after dark spell, fighting with the mummy who
now had him in his dark embrace. I can still hear my father scream &quot;You
WILL die at my hand Gynok Moltor&quot;. That name hammers in my brain….Gynok…Gynok…Gynok.
It is this name that I go to bed with at night, and this name that is with me
throughout his waking moments. Gynok must die. I have matured and honed my
skills in order to avenge the one person in life that I truly love. I can still
hear the triumphant laugh of Gynok Moltor as the life slipped from my father.
Hatred and blackness is all I know and it is this hatred and blackness that will
ultimately free me from it. Gynok Moltar will die. Only then will there be
peace. Only then can I face the dark reflection that is mine. My quest will
continue until Gynok is sent to hell or my cold and still corpse litters the
floor of befallen!!<br>
