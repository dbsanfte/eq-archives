people will love having you on their raids, and this is good for both your public
status, as well as your guild status.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>1.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>&nbsp; Guild raids will be listed on our calendar usually a month ahead of time,
guild members wishing to attend will need to sign up. If not enough people sign
up we will ask our allied guilds if they would like to go. If you have a friend
that would like to go, talk to the raid leader before inviting them along, they
should understand if they are allowed to go with, loot is not guaranteed and
should not be expected.&nbsp; Loot distribution is determined by the Raid Leader.&nbsp;
They may use points, or they may use a /rand.&nbsp; Be sure you know
the looting rules before you go.&nbsp; All Raid Leaders will have posted this with
their raiding message.<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>2.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>&nbsp; If you sign up for a raid you should make every effort to&nbsp; attend. If
real life issues come up try to post on the boards or talk to the raid leader.&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>3.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>&nbsp; If you do not have your own mode of transportation be sure to log off near
a ring or the Raid spot the night before.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>4.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>&nbsp; Anyone not there at the appointed time will not be going on the raid unless
prior arrangements were made with the raid leader. This might seem harsh but
it is unfair having dozens of people, who showed up on time and in the proper place,
to wait around for you.&nbsp; If you still show up, you will not be guaranteed
a place, and you will have to make your way to us, if possible.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>5.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>&nbsp; If you do NOT plan on listening to the Raid Leader, please do us all a favor
and DON'T show up.&nbsp; If you have suggestions or concerns about how a raid
is or will go, send a TELL to the RL.&nbsp; It is rude to do it in the chat channel,
or raid channel.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>6.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>Also, </FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxFF0000n>WAIT FOR ASSIST</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn> to be called.&nbsp; Can't stress that enough.&nbsp; <BR>
When you arrive at the
prep spot disband from your present group, sit and turn on your LFG flag so the
raid leader (RL) can start assigning groups and designate Main Tank (MT) Secondary
Tank (ST), Main Healer (MH), Secondary Healer (SH) and Puller.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>7.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>Make your assist keys.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>8.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn> If you get an add announce it. Do not run around with an add and do not fight it.
The MT will taunt it off, the enchanter will mez it or someone will pull and
root it, all through the RL's direction.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>9.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>Never attack a mob until the MT calls for assist, the MH is there to heal the MT
and they will not heal you if you aggro the mob away from the MT.&nbsp; <BR>

However we may be forced to move ahead without you. If you log back in and get
aggro'd do not run back to the group with it, unless you are told to bring it
by the RL, otherwise expect to die where you stand. We will res you when it is
safe to do so but the safety of the entire raiding party comes first.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>12.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>When asked for a status report, like for mana, the channel only needs to hear from
the </FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxFF0000n>group leaders</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>. Every healer, enchanter, and nuker stating their mana status in a separate line
means no one really knows what the RAID mana status is.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px0080FFn>13.</FONT><FONT CLASS=Arial-16px008000n>We really don't need to see in chat that you are assisting MT. 10 melee or other

&nbsp; <BR>
Participation in guild events is appriciated.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Random Raiding&nbsp; <BR>
Some raids can not be scheduled in advance
due to the nature of the NPC that are being hunted, Dragons, high level quest mobs,
epic mobs etc....&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
If you see a mob up. (i.e. Phinny,
VSR) give an officer a tell. They will help you organize and gather people,
and call on our allies if more people are needed and/or we don't have enough of
a specific class on at the time.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
NOTE: For each encounter
it requires a minimum number of people. Keep this in mind, sometimes there
just might not be enough people for a reasonable chance for success.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
1.
The raid leader will do all looting. In the case of multiple groups
the group leader will loot and report the loot to the raid channel. If a NO DROP
item is encountered it will be reported to the raid leader (or raidchannel)
and it will be looted according to the loot rules.&nbsp; People who will use the
item get first dibs, then people who can use.&nbsp; If none are present, then
someone else can loot if the item can me MQ'd. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
2. Loot will
be turned over to whoever can use, according to need.&nbsp; Do not take something
you will not use or that your secondary can use. Primaries get first shot
always but only if they are on the raid. <BR>
<BR>
3. If more than one group
is formed the groups will be based on the most efficient method and not in order
to get experience.&nbsp; Of course, with Planes of Power, everyone will get exp
if all the raiders have the expansion.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
4. We raid for challenge
and fun and NOT experience. In a good raid formation the group with the MT
(main tank) will get most of the experience anyway. This is by design as we want
the mobs to always focus on the MT and not the casters <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
5.
*DO NOT* show up late and expect someone to come get you. Make your way there
as best as possible and we'll do our best to get you in a group. <BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
6. Each raid will have a break point which is usually at least an hour into
the raid (when it starts not when it is forming) in which people can be ported
out who need to leave. This depends on if the raid location will allow this.
MANY raids are hard to get to so ask before the raid starts if you will need to
leave early. Of course if you can port you can always port out but PLEASE give
due warning as the raid may depend on your class. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
7. It is
not considered polite to ask about loot drops during the raid in the open. Keep
it in group or in tells. Talking about loot makes it seem like that is the only
reason you are there. If you want to know about drops check out the many web
sights BEFORE the raid. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
8. Role-play and other silliness is
encouraged between fights but in battle we are serious. Let's all have lots of
fun on raids. There is plenty of downtime between battles to live it up some.
<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Raid Structure <BR>
<BR>
1. There will be one MT (main Tank)
and one backup. Before the raid start each player will set two assist hotkeys.
One for the MT and one for the backup if the MT falls during battle. (/assist
&lt;maintank&gt;) <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
2. There will be one puller (ideally someone
who can FD) and one backup. The job of the puller is to pull to near the raid
and FD. The backup puller then waits until the area is clear (in cases of multiple
pulls) and the secondary then pulls one to the raid. The point is that
ONLY THE DESIGNATED PULLER PULLS! <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
3. Each group (if possible)
will have a main and backup healer. Neither of these healers will do anything
other than heal unless they are FoM and then only at the discretion of the group
leader. <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
4. At the conclusion of the raid it is up to YOU
to make sure you have a way out. <BR>
