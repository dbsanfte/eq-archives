<DIV ID="idElement1" style="position:absolute; top:14px; left:13px; width:529px; height:2070px;"><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=529><TR VALIGN=top><TD><DIV align=left><FONT CLASS=Arial-16pxn>Communication within a guild is essential. We use it to keep in touch with one another,
to ask for assistance, find groups or partners, ask questions, celebrate
achievements and to chat, joke and share news of our lives.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
We believe in freedom of speech, we do however realize that we have many
members of varying ages and beliefs, and as we do not wish to censor anyone we
must respect one another.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Guildmates are like family.&nbsp;
We always want to treat them with respect.&nbsp; If you are invited to group/raid
with another guild member, be sure you know all the details of such.&nbsp; Also,
if you do not have much time to play, be sure you let the group/raid know,
so that they can decide if they need you.<BR>
<BR>
If there is anything you
see that needs to be improved, wether it be the guild web site, message board,
rules, raids, etc, be sure to let us know.&nbsp; You can e-mail us, send us a tell,
or post it on the Message board.&nbsp; We always appriciate feedback.&nbsp;
We cannot improve as a whole if no one speaks up when they see something that
needs fixing.&nbsp; One of my favorite sayings...'I can't fix it if I don't know
it's broken.'<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
The general rating of guild chat should be kept
to PG-13, mild language etc... slips happen at times, but abusive language
and derogatory comments regarding race, age, sex, religion, and sexual orientation
will not be tolerated in any form and will lead to either a warning or guild
removal depending on the severity of the offense. <BR>
We do not however wish
this to become an excuse for people to be language police. Most profane words
will be filtered out using EQ's own filtering system. If you are offended by mild
language you are encouraged to turn your filter on by typing /filter.&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Personal problems between members should not be aired in guild
chat.Guild chat is also not an auction channel, if you have an item that you
wish to offer to guild members before you try selling to the public feel free,
but please do not spam everyone. We also have a space for selling on our message
board, it's location is The Horde.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
If you have a question
ask a few times, the people on might not know the answer and it should
not be necessary to elicit an "I don't know" response from every guild member online.&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Same goes for a teleport, res etc... ask a few
times.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Family Matters&nbsp; <BR>
If you have a problem
with another guild member and can not resolve it yourselves in /Tells. Give a
/Tell to an Elder or an Ancient, they will try to settle any disputes. The Venerable
Fillie and/or Elders/Ancients are final. If no Elders/Ancients are on, take
a step back, allow tempers to cool then discuss it. If nothing can be resolved
without an officer drop it until one logs on. You may get angry and frustrated
by an event but a word of warning, we have a general no return policy. If you
in anger /guildremove yourself you will not be allowed back except with the
express permission of the Venerable Fillie. Dramatic exits don't do anyone any
good. If you have a problem/concern, talk to an Elder/Ancient or email Fillie directly.
This is your family too, if you see something that you think needs fixing,
help fix it. This includes problems with officers and/or the guild leader
herself. We are all adult enough to handle constructive criticism, but also try
to think of solutions as well. General complaining doesn't do any good without
idea's to correct the problems you perceive. No guild is perfect but by working
together we can improve ourselves.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Power Leveling <BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
If a guildmate offers to power level you that is fine. How you
level your character is your business, but do not use guild chat to solicit someone
to power level you and keep it out of guild chat if someone does. We do not
want other guildmembers to think that it is their right to be power leveled.
We are here to help one another true, but not by power leveling.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Public Conduct&nbsp; <BR>
The reputation of EDoN is extremely important.
Most people who meet up with one or more of us have only good things to
say.&nbsp; <BR>
Some basic rules should be noted to avoid any confusion as to
where we of EDoN stand.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
OOC, Shout, and Auction Channels:
Use of public channels should adhere to EQ's policies. Profanity or obnoxious
behavior should never be used in a public forum and never spam a zone.&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR>
Grouping: The basic PnP should be in effect. While grouping if you
must leave, try to find a replacement for yourself if possible and try to let
your group know ahead of time if you must leave. Sometimes you have to log off
immediately with barely a word, emergencies come up. Try not to make a habit out
of it, Suddenly leaving a group looks bad on you and on us, and may hinder you
obtaining a group in the future.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Looting is usually
decided on a per group basis, be sure everyone knows the looting rules. Ninja looting
an item is grounds for immediate removal from the guild.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
There will be no intentional KSing or training by a Dragon. Improper
conduct by one person can tarnish the entire guilds name. anyone found to be intentionally
training or KSing will be given ONE warning.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Accidental
KSing and even false charges of KSing and Ninja looting does happen.
Your word as a Dragon is generally good enough, if you are contacted by an
officer do not take offense or assume we are accusing you. We need to hear your
side of the story to help us defuse the situation if we are contacted. However
an accusation of improper conduct by a Dragon will be taken seriously and investigated
fully, if more charges are brought up and you are found guilty you will
be removed from guild.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Selling of items: Items made
or found while hunting that you wish to sell or trade you of course are free to
do so, if you choose to sell to a guild mate a price of less then market value
would be appreciated, for improving a guild mates equipment helps to improve the
guild itself, but it is not required. Selling to the public should be done honestly.
Purposely deceiving someone on a sale/purchase or trade is not what Dragon's
do. When people deal with us they should never have to question our integrity.&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
Guild Tags: You guild tag should be visible at
all times. If you must hide your class, etc. use the /roleplay switch. Which will
keep your guild tag but hide your class/level/race/location. The exception to
the rule would be if you are selling in the bazaar and are AFK for long periods
of time.&nbsp; <BR>
