	The Lions have been busy in the Planes of Power the last few months. Our raiding alliance, the Gathering of Banners, stands on the doorstep of the Elemental Planes ... only a final confrontation with Rallos Zek the Warlord stands between us.
	<p>
	Although pictures of our recent events are scarce, here are a few snapshots to remember this summer and fall by:<p>

	Korocust, the ... Sarnak? traitor

<p>
	Sadly, our attempts to aid my allies, the royal house of Chardok, have to date been in vain. But someday, I swear it, the traitor will die!

	Greetings members and prospective members of Coeur de Lion.  If you have any questions you can contact
	the <a href = "members/officers.html" >Leader 
	and Officers</a>, drop us a line on the <a href = "http://pub76.ezboard.com/bcdl">Public Forum </a>on
	our Discussion Boards, or email me at <a href = "mailto:jcox@p3.net">Mallo Artanos</a>.  It is my
	hope to hear from you; we plan to grow.  The <a href = "charter.html">charter</a> is 
	also linked to this page. </p>

	<p>
	To those of you that looked at this guild thinking we were French we are sorry.  As a group we decided
	to follow the 	path of the myth of King Richard the Lionheart or Richard Coeur de Lion.  So we are as
	French as the King of England.
	</p>
	<p>
	Most of the current members have been in other guilds in the past and found ourselves wanting more from 
	the guild. Our desire was for a guild that worked toward the common good.  That protected the weak 
	and had a good orientation.  We are warriors in the battle of good and evil and we have chosen the 
	side of light. If you feel that any thing that 	moves on Norrath is there to be killed and looted we 
	are not the guild for you.  If you see Norrath as a world under siege by dark forces and wish to oppose 
	them we welcome you. We encourage role playing and want our members to feel comfortable role playing to
	their hearts content, but it is not required. 
	</p>

	What we do require is outlined in the charter but in short; <b>Honor, Loyalty, and Bravery. </b>
<p>
