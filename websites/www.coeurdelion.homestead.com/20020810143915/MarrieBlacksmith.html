Actually, even if you have 21 practices to spend on this skill, I don't recommend using them; this is probably the only Trade Skill about which I can say that. But you'll be needing a heck of a lot of Metal Bits to build your skill, and if your skill is less than 21, you might as well build your skill by making them, since you'll need them soon enough.</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><U><B><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Step Two: Toolboxes (Skill 21-51)</FONT></FONT></B></U></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">These are eight-slot containers (and, incidentally, they'll even hold Halberds, unlike backpacks), so make sure you have empty slots for them in your inventory. They're used in the Tinkering skill, but they're fairly common and eaxy to make, so their isn't much of a market for them. The recipe: one Metal Bit plus one Flask of Water, combined in the forge; success yields one Toolbox, failure destroys the components. Used to be you could make a lot of money selling these to merchants: they'd pay up to 9gp for them last summer. In fact, the money I made selling the Toolboxes I made between skill 21 and 51 back to the merchants basically paid for the rest of my Blacksmithing practice.

It's not that the recipe is that complicated, or particularly tough: it's that in order to get to the point where you can make Skewers, you first have to make the Metal Bits. The recipe: one Metal Bit, one Flask of Water, and one Skewer Mold; success yields one Skewer (unstackable), failure destroys the components. Skewers are used in Baking, so if you're working on that Skill, you might want to save some of these to try some of the kabob recipes; otherwise, you can sell them back to the merchants to recoup some of your losses. Note that the trivial level on this skill may have changed: for me, Skewers were trivial at skill 121, but EQTraders reports that they're now trivial at 115.

Then, get up and get back to work! Banded armor is the first item you can make that you can sell to other players at a real profit: the standard price is 1pp per AC, although I sold full sets for 80pp (a full set has 91 points of AC); this represents about a 50% markup on the cost to make the items, but at this point, you should have a decent success rate at making it. The recipe: one Flask of Water, one armor Mold, and 1-3 Sheets of Metal appropriate to the mold; success yields the appropriate piece of armor, failure destroys the components. Boots, Bracers and Gorgets require one Sheet of Metal; Belts, Cloaks, Gauntlets, Helms, Mantles, Masks, and Sleeves require two Sheets of Metal; Leggings and Tunics require three Sheets of Metal. At skill 135, everything but Cloaks, Gauntlets, Leggings and Mantles are trivial. If Large Sewing Kits are trivial at less than 135, I recommend making Boots to skill 135, as they only require one Sheet of Metal. Likewise, from skill 135-168, I recommend making Gauntlets or Mantles because they require two Sheets of Metal versus the three required by the Leggings. From skill 168-175, you can make Cloaks to advance your skill.</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><U><B><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Step Seven: New Armors (Skill 175+)</FONT></FONT></B></U></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">This is the point I'm at now, and basically there are two ways to advance your skill: Ornate Chain and Fine Steel Plate.

The Small Bricks of High Quality Ore run about 11pp each, and you'll need three of them in order to make one Large Brick of High Quality Ore: three Small Bricks of High Quality Ore plus one Flask of Water combined in a forge; success yields one Large Brick of High Quality Ore, failure destroys the components. Then, you need to make that Large Brick into Metal Rings: one Large Brick of High Quality Ore, one Flask of Water and one File, combined in a forge; success yields one High Quality Metal Ring (unstackable) and one File, failure returns one File. Once you have the Rings you need, you can make Ornate Chain Mail: one Flask of Water, one Smithy Hammer, one Silver Bar (unenchanted), the appropriate Chainmail Pattern, and 1-3 High Quality Rings; success yields the appropriate piece of Ornate Chain armor and one Smithy Hammer, failure returns one Smithy Hammer. Bracers, Gorgets and Masks requre one Ring each; Belts, Boots, Gauntlets, Helms, Mantles and Sleeves require 2 Rings each; Cloaks, Leggings and Tunics require 3 Rings each. At skill 175, everything but Cloaks, Gauntlets, Leggings, Mantles and Tunics will be trivial. EQTraders lists the trivial levels for the other pieces, but until those levels are confirmed by myself or another guildmember, I won't post them here.</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">For Fine Plate Armor, you'll need to buy three Large Bricks of Medium Quality Ore from the vendor in the second windmill in Steamfont for each Medium Quality Sheet of Folded Metal you need, and you'll need 1-3 Sheets for each piece of armor. I'm told that there's a vendor in Highpass that also sells the Medium Quality Ore, but I've never seen him, nor is Highpass a zone that is very conducive to practicing your Trade Skills. To make the MQ Folded Sheets, first you need to make Blocks: the Large Bricks of Medium Quality Ore plus one Flask of Water combined in a forge; success yields one Large Brick of Medium Quality Ore, failure destroys the components. Then you use the Bricks to make the Sheets: one Brick of Medium Quality Ore, one Flask of Water, and one Smithy Hammer combined in a forge; success yields one Medium Quality Folded Sheet of Metal and one Smithy Hammer, failure yields one Smithy Hammer. Then you use the Sheets to make the armor: one Leather Backing, one Flask of Water, one Smithy Hammer, one plate Mold, and 1-3 Medium Quality Folded Sheets of Metal; success yields the appropriate piece of Fine Plate armor and one Smithy Hammer; failure yields one Smithy Hammer. Bracers, Collars and Visors requre one Sheet; Boots, Gauntlets, Girdles, Helms, Pauldruns (shoulders), and Vambraces (sleeves) require two Sheets; Breastplates, Cloaks and Greaves require three Sheets. None of these pieces are trivial at skill 175; not even EQTraders is sure about the level at which they are trivial.</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Cultural Armors won't be covered here, if only because the information about them is not confirmed, for the most part. We do know that they are not trivial, probably not even makable, at a skill less than 200: you need to be a Grand Master Blacksmith in order to attempt them. And with all of the components required to make them, these pieces are almost the equivalent of quest armors. You can investigate the Cultural Recipes at EQTraders, though. </FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><U><B><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">How I did it:</FONT></FONT></B></U></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">I started Blacksmithing when I was a complete newbie -- at level 2 I ran to Steamfont to buy as many Sharpening Stones as I could afford (not many, at the time). I began sharpening weapons that dropped off the decaying skeletons and orc pawns I fought in the Greater Faydark, and built my skill up by a good amount before I even saw my first piece of ore. I even went as far as to buy rusty weapons from vendors, sharpen them and sell them back. By the time I was level 4, I moved to Freeport and began practicing in earnest. As I said above, the price merchants paid for Toolboxes at the time allowed you to make an outrageous profit, and thus I was able to pay for all the practicing I needed to get to skill 135. When I made it to that magic, &#034;no-more-Metal-Bits&#034; skill level, I made my first full set of Banded Armor, then went out to the Commons to sell it. From skill 135 to skill 150, that's how I built my skill -- making banded armor as I sold it. It wasn't until Garreth (bless his soul) pointed out that by practicing and selling the armor back to the merchants you're essentially only eating your failures that I decided to powerlevel up to 175. And believe it or not, even with all the Fine Plate and Ornate Chain I've made since, I've only gained one or maybe two skill points -- it may be time for me to powerlevel again, using Fine Plate Bracers. </FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><U><B><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">How I wish I'd done it:</FONT></FONT></B></U></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Sharpening rusty weapons is a great way to advance your skill -- if you're a newbie, and can still pick them up from blue or better mobs. Buying them, sharpening and re-selling them is a money sink; I should've focussed on making Metal Bits. (Of course, I didn't know then the overwhelming number I'd have to use to get my skill up -- I estimate I've made close to 80 stacks of Metal Bits in the course of my Blacksmithing career.) Other than that, though, I pretty much followed the plan I outlined here. If I could do it again, I would powerlevel to 175 sooner ... it would make the subsequent sets of Banded armor I made cheaper due to fewer failures, and allow me to make a greater profit. But given the fact that Toolboxes have been nerfed, I might have had to go in the opposite direction -- making and selling banded armor at an earlier skill level in order to finance my training.</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><U><B><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Resources:</FONT></FONT></B></U></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Basic Blacksmithing recipes (everything up to and including Banded armor) are available at this link:</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><A HREF=http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing.htm TARGET="_parent"><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing.htm</FONT></A></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Advanced Blacksmithing recipes (including Ornate Chain Mail and Fine Steel Plate) are found at this link:</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><A HREF=http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_advanced.htm TARGET="_parent"><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_advanced.htm</FONT></A></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Links to pages for each of the various Cultural Armor recipes can be found here:</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><A HREF=http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_cultural_main.htm TARGET="_parent"><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_cultural_main.htm</FONT></A></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">And a list of Blacksmithing supplies can be found here:</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><A HREF=http://www.eqtraders.com/location/smithing.htm TARGET="_parent"><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">http://www.eqtraders.com/location/smithing.htm</FONT></A></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><U><B><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Related Skills:</FONT></FONT></B></U></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Blacksmithing has perhaps the largest list of associated Trade Skills:</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Alchemy and/or Poison Making is used to make extracts for the dyes used to stain Fine Plate armor.

Then, get up and get back to work! Banded armor is the first item you can make that you can sell to other players at a real profit: the standard price is 1pp per AC, although I sold full sets for 80pp (a full set has 91 points of AC); this represents about a 50% markup on the cost to make the items, but at this point, you should have a decent success rate at making it. The recipe: one Flask of Water, one armor Mold, and 1-3 Sheets of Metal appropriate to the mold; success yields the appropriate piece of armor, failure destroys the components. Boots, Bracers and Gorgets require one Sheet of Metal; Belts, Cloaks, Gauntlets, Helms, Mantles, Masks, and Sleeves require two Sheets of Metal; Leggings and Tunics require three Sheets of Metal. At skill 135, everything but Cloaks, Gauntlets, Leggings and Mantles are trivial. If Large Sewing Kits are trivial at less than 135, I recommend making Boots to skill 135, as they only require one Sheet of Metal. Likewise, from skill 135-168, I recommend making Gauntlets or Mantles because they require two Sheets of Metal versus the three required by the Leggings.

The Small Bricks of High Quality Ore run about 11pp each, and you'll need three of them in order to make one Large Brick of High Quality Ore: three Small Bricks of High Quality Ore plus one Flask of Water combined in a forge; success yields one Large Brick of High Quality Ore, failure destroys the components. Then, you need to make that Large Brick into Metal Rings: one Large Brick of High Quality Ore, one Flask of Water and one File, combined in a forge; success yields one High Quality Metal Ring (unstackable) and one File, failure returns one File. Once you have the Rings you need, you can make Ornate Chain Mail: one Flask of Water, one Smithy Hammer, one Silver Bar (unenchanted), the appropriate Chainmail Pattern, and 1-3 High Quality Rings; success yields the appropriate piece of Ornate Chain armor and one Smithy Hammer, failure returns one Smithy Hammer.

Then you use the Bricks to make the Sheets: one Brick of Medium Quality Ore, one Flask of Water, and one Smithy Hammer combined in a forge; success yields one Medium Quality Folded Sheet of Metal and one Smithy Hammer, failure yields one Smithy Hammer. Then you use the Sheets to make the armor: one Leather Backing, one Flask of Water, one Smithy Hammer, one plate Mold, and 1-3 Medium Quality Folded Sheets of Metal; success yields the appropriate piece of Fine Plate armor and one Smithy Hammer; failure yields one Smithy Hammer. Bracers, Collars and Visors requre one Sheet; Boots, Gauntlets, Girdles, Helms, Pauldruns (shoulders), and Vambraces (sleeves) require two Sheets; Breastplates, Cloaks and Greaves require three Sheets.

I began sharpening weapons that dropped off the decaying skeletons and orc pawns I fought in the Greater Faydark, and built my skill up by a good amount before I even saw my first piece of ore. I even went as far as to buy rusty weapons from vendors, sharpen them and sell them back. By the time I was level 4, I moved to Freeport and began practicing in earnest. As I said above, the price merchants paid for Toolboxes at the time allowed you to make an outrageous profit, and thus I was able to pay for all the practicing I needed to get to skill 135. When I made it to that magic, &#034;no-more-Metal-Bits&#034; skill level, I made my first full set of Banded Armor, then went out to the Commons to sell it. From skill 135 to skill 150, that's how I built my skill -- making banded armor as I sold it. It wasn't until Garreth (bless his soul) pointed out that by practicing and selling the armor back to the merchants you're essentially only eating your failures that I decided to powerlevel up to 175. And believe it or not, even with all the Fine Plate and Ornate Chain I've made since, I've only gained one or maybe two skill points -- it may be time for me to powerlevel again, using Fine Plate Bracers. </FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><U><B><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">How I wish I'd done it:</FONT></FONT></B></U></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Sharpening rusty weapons is a great way to advance your skill -- if you're a newbie, and can still pick them up from blue or better mobs. Buying them, sharpening and re-selling them is a money sink; I should've focussed on making Metal Bits. (Of course, I didn't know then the overwhelming number I'd have to use to get my skill up -- I estimate I've made close to 80 stacks of Metal Bits in the course of my Blacksmithing career.) Other than that, though, I pretty much followed the plan I outlined here. If I could do it again, I would powerlevel to 175 sooner ... it would make the subsequent sets of Banded armor I made cheaper due to fewer failures, and allow me to make a greater profit. But given the fact that Toolboxes have been nerfed, I might have had to go in the opposite direction -- making and selling banded armor at an earlier skill level in order to finance my training.</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><U><B><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Resources:</FONT></FONT></B></U></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Basic Blacksmithing recipes (everything up to and including Banded armor) are available at this link:</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><A HREF=http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing.htm TARGET="_parent"><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing.htm</FONT></A></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Advanced Blacksmithing recipes (including Ornate Chain Mail and Fine Steel Plate) are found at this link:</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><A HREF=http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_advanced.htm TARGET="_parent"><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_advanced.htm</FONT></A></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Links to pages for each of the various Cultural Armor recipes can be found here:</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><A HREF=http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_cultural_main.htm TARGET="_parent"><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_smithing_cultural_main.htm</FONT></A></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">And a list of Blacksmithing supplies can be found here:</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><A HREF=http://www.eqtraders.com/location/smithing.htm TARGET="_parent"><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">http://www.eqtraders.com/location/smithing.htm</FONT></A></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><U><B><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Related Skills:</FONT></FONT></B></U></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Blacksmithing has perhaps the largest list of associated Trade Skills:</FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Alchemy and/or Poison Making is used to make extracts for the dyes used to stain Fine Plate armor. Dyeing armor is actually one of the more complicated procedures in the game: you need an alchemist to make the extract, then a potter to make a Medium Clay Jar to make the dye, then a blacksmith to combine the dye, the acid, and the armor. It was previously believed that there was no Blacksmithing skill check for dyeing armor, but it has been learned that on a failed Blacksmithing skill roll, you lose the dye (although you do keep the armor ... whew! ). Information about dyeing plate can, again, be found at EQTraders:&nbsp; </FONT></FONT><A HREF=http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_dyes.htm TARGET="_parent"><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_dyes.htm</FONT></A><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">.&nbsp; I'm putting this link on the Blacksmithing thread because I won't be making Alchemy or Poison Making threads -- they're class-restricted, so I can never master them. </FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2"><BR></FONT></FONT></DIV><DIV align=left><FONT COLOR=#d8c2f1><FONT class="TimesRoman13" FACE="Times New Roman, adobe-times, Times" SIZE="2">Brewing is used to make the Tempers for the various Cultural Armors.
