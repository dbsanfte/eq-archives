	<p>
Need before Greed is the standard Coeur de Lion Loot policy with the following structures and definitions. By 
attending a Coeur de Lion raid you agree to abide by this loot policy. If you cannot or do not agree to these
 policies please let the Raid Leader (RL) and or the Loot Co-Ordinator (LCO) know what your problems are and 
give them your reasons. Loot discussions should be held well before a raid begins or after it is over.  We're 
reasonable people but the middle of a Raid is the wrong time and place to argue loot.
</p>
<p>
If you get to a Raid after it has started you will not be eligible to roll for loot until a span of time equal
to the hours you were late has passed. If the raid started at 3PM and you get there at 5PM (two hours late) you
 will be eligible for items after 7PM (two hours after you join the raid). This time limit will be waived for 
players that have been invited by the Raid Leader to join late to provide a needed class for a raid, or to save
 a raid from going badly, though it would be nice of them to defer to folks that were there for break in.
</p>
<p>
<b>Need before greed is defined as follows:</b>
</p>
<p>
You will be allowed to roll or have a chance for any item that your class would commonly use. We ask that you 
not roll for any item to resell or to give to an alt; defer to those that would use the item for the character 
attending the raid. 
</p>
<p>
What this means in practice is that if an item is all/all but carries a large bonus to INT and WIS then the 
primary people rolling will be pure casters. The reverse is also true if the item is all/all but would benefit 
Melees more then Casters; Casters will be excluded from rolling. 
</p>
<p>
An example is the Cloak of Flames: AC, Melee stats, and 35% haste. This is an awesome Melee item with no mana, 
no INT, no WIS. It is a nice Caster item, but more to trade for things they'd actually use. Only Melees that 
didn't have better would be allowed to roll for this item.
</p>
<p>
Once you have gotten an item you are ineligible for further item loot until all people on the raid have gotten 
an item. Exceptions to this are:
</p>
<p>
If everyone in your class has gotten an item and something that only your class can use comes up then you would 
be allowed to roll again.
</p>
<p>
If the item is no drop and you are the only person that can and will use the item, it goes to you.
</p>
<p>
If we are on a planes raid and you can prove (wearing is good proof) that you need one item to complete a suit 
of armor you will have priority for that piece.
</p>
<p>
The other exception is sponsored or targeted Raids. If the Raid has been set up with the goal of getting X 
person Y item, that person is ineligible for other loot unless they are the only person that can and will use 
something that drops on the way to gaining Y item.
</p>
<p>
<b>Special Cases:</b>
</p>
<p>
Spells:  Spells will go to the person that can sit down and scribe the spell on the spot. If no one on the raid 
can use the spell immediately it will go to the highest level person that does not already have the spell in the 
bank. If no one on the raid needs or can use the spell it will be offered to the guilds attending to see if one 
of their members can use it. Caster levels will again dictate which Guild receives the spell. In the case that 
two or more casters who need the spell are the same level then they will roll for possession of the spell.
</p>
<p>
Quest items that are in their own right good items. Red and White Dragon scales. for example are needed for the 
Warrior Epic and for the Bard Epic repectively. They can also be used in quests by melees (Red Dragon Scale), 
or casters (White Dragon Scale) for very nice items. These items will be rolled for by all that can use them / 
need them.
</p>
<p>
Gems: Diamonds and Blue Diamonds will be collected by the Loot Coordinator and randomed after items and spells 
have been distributed at the end of the raid.
</p>
<p>
Lesser gems (Any not mentioned above) are the property of the Raid leader to reimburse his Guild's expenses. 
</p>
<p>
Jewelry is the property of the Raid leader to reimburse the Guild, Clerics, Enchanters, and others that might 
be out of pocket on the raid.
</p>
<p>
Coin is the property of the Raid leader to reimburse those that are out of pocket on the Raid.
</p>
<p>
These items will be used to try to keep the raids free. If cash begins to build up this policy will be modified.
</p>
<p>
<b>What happens when a MoB is killed:</b>
</p>
<p>
The group leader that got the kill should check the MoB not splitting cash with his group. If there is an item 
and it's not No Drop he lets the LCO know and picks up the item. When there is a slow moment during the Raid it 
will be announced and rolled for. 
</p>
<p>
If the item is No Drop he lets the LCO and RL know and they will as quickly as possible get the item rolled for 
and the proper person over to loot the item. 

</p>
<p>Anyone looting No Drop items out of turn or not letting the LCO know of drops will not be welcome on future 
raids and may be dismissed from the raid on the spot.
</p>
<p>
<b>Rolling for items:</b>
</p>
<p>
Rolls for items will be /random 200 by all eligible players. The LCO or a designated alternate announced before 
the roll will also roll /random 200. The player who's roll is closest to the roll of the LCO or their alternate 
will win the item.
</p>
<p>
<b>Targeted raids:</b>
</p>
<p>
Some Coeur de Lion raids will be held with the express purpose of getting a specific item or items for a certain
 person or persons. In this case those items will be designated loot and not available to be randomed among the
 classes that can use them. Raids of this nature will be clearly posted with a listing of the designated loot in 
the raid description. Supporters of Coeur de Lion raids who require certain items and are not lucky with their 
dice can request a targeted raid to obtain the items they desire.
</p>
<p>
Epic quest items are the best example of Targeted Raids. As people get close to not being able to hunt Vox or 
Nagafen we will be designating Scales and Paladin quest items for those folks.
