"You are always frowning, Erudite," Destinae said in a huff. The Fier'Dal female clearly enjoyed Rainmaker’s splendor as Karana's blessings fell heavily upon the Southern Plains of his namesake. 
<p>
Mesaoyatun sat under the branches of a large tree while his three Wood Elf companions, the druids Destinae, Birinair & the ranger Tinolwen, sat on the hillside in front of him & savored the elements.
<p>
"Aye, knight," Tinolwen said matter-of-factly. "You will not melt away. The courageous don't fear the feel of nature on their faces."
<p>
"Aye, silly elves. But the wise know when to seek shelter from the storm," retorted the drenched son of Erud. 
<p>
Mesaoyatun sighed. It would be not his fate to die facing dragons or the hellspawn of Inorruuk.
<p>
More than likely, he felt that his end would come from some ungodly respiratory ailment brought about by the damnable weather in Antonica.
<p>
As the rain tapered off, the Fier'Dal returned from their brief, soggy revelry to the shelter of the tree where Mesaoyatun sat & fumed. The Erudite was far from happy with the present conditions.
<p>
"So this is the area where your friend fell?" Mesaoyatun asked. A companion of Destinae's had been killed by a raiding party of the Torn Ear clan several days prior. The Torn Ear were the gnolls who had usurped control of Infected Paw away from its previous owners, the Clan of Splitpaw.
<p>
"Aye," Destinae said. Mesaoyatun's heart grew heavy as Destinae's face contorted a bit into a slight frown. The paladin could see the tears in her eyes streaming down her face; mixing with the rainwater as they ran the length of her cheeks.
<p>
“I am very sorry,” the paladin said. Somehow, he felt that he trod on sensitive ground with Destinae & his stark frankness had offended her. “I had no idea that….”
<p>
"It is our task to recover his remains & return them to Kelethin," Birinair interjected. "If many of the Verishe Mal die in the effort, then that will be an added benefit."
<p>
Luclin began to rise high into the night sky. As she ascended into the heavens, Tinolwen bolted up from where he had been sitting & glanced about nervously.
<p>
Destinae & Birinair did likewise; the three Wood Elves were clearly agitated about something. Mesaoyatun stared at the three of them curiously.
<p>
"What is it?" he asked.
<p>
"Quiet, paladin," Tinolwen hissed. "Something evil comes this way."
<p>
"I don't hear a thing."
<p>
"To hear, one merely has to listen, son of Odus," Destinae whispered. "You don't have the trained ear of the Fier'Dal. ‘Tis probably a result of reading about life & not experiencing it."
<p>
Mesaoyatun scowled but did not take offense. Clearly this was not the time for an argument.
<p>
The four companions watched the shadows to the east of their position & sure enough, something was headed towards them. The faint noise in the wind was clearly the wailing of some animal; a dog of some sort. Perhaps the noises were the celebratory howls of a Torn Ear raiding party & they would be close to claiming retribution on behalf of Destinae’s fallen friend.
<p>
The druids quickly assumed the forms of wolves as Tinolwen readied an arrow & Mesaoyatun drew his sword. 
<p>
The dark form that strode towards them was indeed dog shaped; its ears rode high upon its head & mist from its fetid breath outline its muzzle. 
<p>
As it came closer, their horror rose. 
<p>
It was not a Verishe Mal.
<p>
The beast was covered in thick, gray hair & appeared to be some twisted hybrid of wolf & man. Its large mouth opened & produced a terrifying roar; gleaming white fangs eagerly dripped with froth. 
<p>
The creature's haunting yellow eyes fixed on the quartet & the monster bit it's own lip from the anticipation of killing the four of them. A small trickle of blood & saliva rolled down its chin.
<p>
"Tunare be merciful!!" Tinolwen shouted, "It is a werewolf!! The beast means to have us all!!"
<p>
"Bismillah, not without a fight!" Mesaoyatun exclaimed. The Erudite's bravado hid his fear well. He could feel the bile rising up in his throat, but now was not the time for doubting one's ability. 
<p>
It was time to kill or be killed.
<p>
The creature ploughed headlong into them. As it ran, Tinolwen managed to get off a volley of two arrows; the shafts bit deeply into the monster, but didn't slow it in the least. The ranger uttered a curse in his native tongue & drew his blades.
<p>
Mesa stood his ground as the werewolf bore down on him with frightening speed. Though several feet separated them, the paladin could feel the hot breath of the werewolf upon his face.
<p>
The lycanthrope roared again & bared its claws. There was no turning back now, as the beast could easily catch up to the four of them if they ran. The paladin doubted that the Sprit of the Wolf dweomer placed on him earlier would allow him to evade the rabid behemoth.
<p>
The werewolf lashed out & struck the paladin's shield; the force of the blow nearly knocked Mesaoyatun off of his feet. Tinolwen's blades danced in front of him & he managed to strike minor cuts in the werewolf's hide.
<p>
Though its wounds bled freely, the monster ignored them. It seemed to enjoy the pain that the ranger & the paladin inflicted on it 
<p>
Mesaoyatun & Tinolwen fought with strength born from desperation. 
<p>
They clearly faced a fiend capable of ending their lives quickly & violently. 
<p>
Without warning, the werewolf broke past the pair of warriors & lashed out against one of their druidic companions. The wolf-formed druid let out a pitiful whimper & fell on its side. The pain from the wound broke the druid's concentration & the alteration magic began to unravel.
<p>
The ranger & the paladin watched on in dread as the wolf took the form of Destinae once again. She lay on her side with her eyes closed. Steam rose from the cold ground as her warm blood flowed freely from the open wound on her chest & pooled on the hillside.
<p>
"No!!" Tinolwen screamed. Mesaoyatun grit his teeth together & lashed out at the werewolf with all of the force he could muster. His blade managed to rip open a wound in the horrid killer that would have slain an ordinary man.
<p>
The creature staggered back a few steps & pressed its attack once again.
<p>
"Tend to Destinae, Birinair!!" Mesa shouted, "We will deal with the beast as best we can!!" The other wolf ran to Destinae's fallen form. As it stood over her, Mesa could see motes of bluish light forming around its paws.
<p>
The paladin hoped that Birinair's healing enchantments would be enough to save Destinae.
<p>
Despite Tinolwen & Mesa's valiant efforts, the beast continued to fight with unmatched ferocity. The werewolf savagely raked the Fier'Dal ranger with it's claws; rending flesh & mail as if they were paper. To his credit, the ranger did not cry out, but fell to his knees & propped himself up with one arm.
<p>
His hands clutched the wounds on his chest & the blood rushed through his fingers & down his arm. 
<p>
If he didn't act soon, Mesa would lose two friends at best & they all would die in the worst case.
<p>
The werewolf loomed over the kneeling ranger. It's feral eyes fixed on the Fier'Dal: a claw raised into the air to finish the job it had started. Suddenly, a brilliant flash of light blinded the creature. As it turned to face it's new attacker, the werewolf felt a sharp object press home into it's being.
<p>
Mesa pushed against the sword with all of his remaining strength & he could feel the blade scraping against the werewolf's ribs as he drove the sword further into it's heart. 
<p>
Mesa's confidence quickly faded as the werewolf struck him with tremendous force. The Erudite landed breathlessly on his back before the beast. Mesa's sword was still lodged in the ghastly wound it created. Though weakened, Mesa feared that the deadly shapeshifter would still have enough strength to finish him & kill the others as well.
<p>
As he prepared for death, Mesa noticed that the air around him & the lycanthrope began to crackle. The werewolf howled with pain as a pair of lightning bolts struck the monster. Behind the creature, he could see Destanae & Birinair standing together; the female Wood Elf leaned most of her weight against her comrade, but she still mustered up enough will to fight. The spell had drained all of the remaining strength Destinae had & she collapsed beside her Wood Elf brother.
<p>
Not wanting their distraction to be in vain, Mesa forced himself to his feet & picked up his shield. He ran as fast as he could & launched himself through the air, shield-first into the werewolf.
<p>
The shield drove the sword deep into the monstrous beast's body until only the hilt could be seen. The were-demon's eyes rolled in its sockets & a weak growl escaped its maw as it fell.
<p>
"Allah al Amiq'Mutaj Karim," the grateful paladin said in between swallows of air. Prexus had delivered him from his foe even in ocean-less lands of the Antonicans.
<p>
Mesa's breath came in difficult gasps as he stood over the monster & retrieved his blade from its chest with a forcible tug. Tinolwen managed to get to his feet & slowly staggered to Mesaoyatun's side.
<p>
Both looked on in awe as the werewolf slowly changed form. Before them lie the well-muscled, naked form of a human male. Life briefly flickered in his eyes & he smiled at the pair.
<p>
Mesaoyatun removed his cloak & began to drape it over the man, but the half-dead human refused. Blood streamed from his mouth as he began to speak.
<p>
"I am Alechin. A Knight of Mithaniel Marr. I thank you for freeing me of my curse."
<p>
"Do not talk right now," Mesa said, "We can get you & our injured to the safety of the encampment of the Centaurs. They will help you."
<p>
Alechin’s breathing became more labored & his life’s blood trickled in tiny rivers along his pale lips. “My time is not long here, Erudite, so listen carefully." Alechin pressed a small object into Mesaoyatun’s mailed fist. “Take this to Joanna. She is a knight in the Company of the Dreaming Dragon. They have a camp in the Rathe Mountains. Tell her that Alechin is free….”
<p>
The fallen knight groaned once more & then lie still upon the dew covered grass of the hillside. 
<p>
Death had come for Alechin at last. The peace of the grave & the bravery of four souls had taken his torment from him. 
<p>
Mesaoyatun chanted the Prayer of Cresting Waves & then closed Alechin’s eyes so that he may rest comfortably in eternity.
<p>
He instructed Birinair to get Tinolwen & Destinae to the camp of the Thunderhooves while the paladin stayed behind.
<p>
Mesaoyatun finished the funeral pyre for Alechin as the dawn finally came to South Karana. As it blazed forth, he began the Ritual of Burning. Solusek Ro would strip away the flesh & cleanse Alechin’s soul so that the fallen sentry would be allowed to pass on to Mithaniel’s Hall of Valor. The Erudite smiled, slowly turned & began to walk northeast. 
<p>
The camp of the Centaurs would only be a few hours away.
