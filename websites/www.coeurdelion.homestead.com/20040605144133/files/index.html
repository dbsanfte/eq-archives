<h2>	The Warlord has been defeated!</h2><p>
In seven months we've gone from our first (painful) Grummas kill to defeating the god of War himself; from being unflagged for any Planes of Power zones to being fully flagged for the elementals ...

A scribe writes
<br>
Sir Jocim,
<p>
I see tis I who call you Sir now. Your letter finds me at the feet of my god. So perhaps I can answer your crisis of faith.
<p>
The Teir'dal speak to me of my hate in battle. They fail to understand there is no hate in me for those I face on the battle field.
<p>
The followers of the twins feel they know me better, for I have done them great service. The followers of the Lady are smarter though for they trust me little. Love has more place on the battlefield than hate. It is only in war that you come to love your fellow man for he has seen you at both your best and worst. The followers of the Lord I have no heed for; many are brave and I value them as men, but Honor is a luxury on the battle field. One only the rich can afford, something I have never been. 
<p>
All of the Gods are flawed in some way. 
<p>
I once spoke to you and your young friends of the path of war. A path I have walked these long years. Fighting first in Kunark then in Velious against the Dragon. Of late I have found myself battling the Gods themselves or at least the Shadows they project into the greater planes.
<p>
You speak of the fact that Karana has not answered your prayers; I can shed some light on that. The battles for his rescue that are ever in his fortress leave him little time to aid his followers in Norrath.
<p>
I can also speak to you of the indifference of the Gods. I have grown old and weary unto death. Yet still the Clerics are able to breath back life to my body. For all my prayers, Rallos Zek denies me entrance to the Plane of War. To my just reward, to death eternal. 
<p>
So like you I follow my oaths, I do my duty. I wage war. As a Paladin to Karana your duty is clear as well: to protect the people who believe in you. Even if Karana is no longer providing you the guidance he once was, you know what needs to be done. You know what evils infect the lands you protect.
<p>
Even if your God does not answer you must honor him in all things.
<p>
Veteran Mallo Artanos<br>
Guildleader Coeur de Lion<br>
Butcher of the Karanas<br>
<p>
He glanced away from the scribe to where the dirty-faced band was busy killing off the chaos wraiths. Where the two Erudite women, as different in personality as they were alike in features, set huge lumbering beasts armored in steel on the last of the monsters.
<p>
Where the dwarven and elven clerics, both high and dark, summoned back from the dead the men and women who had labored so long. Who had fought so hard.
<p>
First against the God of Tactics and the God of Strategy to finally end up here in this pit. In the dark of Drundar, in the fortress of the God of War.
<p>
The Ranger next to him asked in her soft voice. "At the feet of your God? You make it sound as if you're taking in his wisdom."
<p>
"I do, he taught me much." 
<p>
The Hobbit was almost giddy as he came back from plundering the vault of the God of War. Gorde's voice was reverent as it only was when he had found a priceless treasure. "Tis good this time, Mallo, we got what we came for."
<p>
Mallo the warlord leaned back against the sole of Rallos Zek the Warlord's boot and surveyed the work that goes on after a successful seige. "He has taught me much, Luniel The body of the god of War still smouldered from the fell magics and blades; the banners of the assembled host waved in the dank breeze. "He has taught me much."

	Greetings members and prospective members of Coeur de Lion.  If you have any questions you can contact
	the <a href = "members/officers.html" >Leader 
	and Officers</a>, drop us a line on the <a href = "http://pub76.ezboard.com/bcdl">Public Forum </a>on
	our Discussion Boards, or email me at <a href = "mailto:jcox@p3.net">Mallo Artanos</a>.  It is my
	hope to hear from you; we plan to grow.  The <a href = "charter.html">charter</a> is 
	also linked to this page. </p>

	<p>
	To those of you that looked at this guild thinking we were French we are sorry.  As a group we decided
	to follow the 	path of the myth of King Richard the Lionheart or Richard Coeur de Lion.  So we are as
	French as the King of England.
	</p>
	<p>
	Most of the current members have been in other guilds in the past and found ourselves wanting more from 
	the guild. Our desire was for a guild that worked toward the common good.  That protected the weak 
	and had a good orientation.  We are warriors in the battle of good and evil and we have chosen the 
	side of light. If you feel that any thing that 	moves on Norrath is there to be killed and looted we 
	are not the guild for you.  If you see Norrath as a world under siege by dark forces and wish to oppose 
	them we welcome you. We encourage role playing and want our members to feel comfortable role playing to
	their hearts content, but it is not required. 
	</p>

	What we do require is outlined in the charter but in short; <b>Honor, Loyalty, and Bravery. </b>
