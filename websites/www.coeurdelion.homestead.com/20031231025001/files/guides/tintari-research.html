Upon reaching their fifth cycle of spells (level16), the pure intelligence caster classes - wizards, mages, necromancers and enchanters - gain a new skill, spell research. With this skill, casters create some of their spells from items dropped in the game, in much the same way as a tailor creates items from animal pelts.
<p>
The basic process is the same for all of the caster classes, but the details differ. 
<p>
 Like weapon skills, spell research is level capped. At any given level, your skill can't be more than (your_level - 15) * 5. So, for example, at level 16 your skill theoretically can't be more than 5. However, when you put your first training point into research your skill is set to your current level. One training point at level 16 gives you a skill of 16. Many young casters are frustrated by the fact that their research skill doesn't seem to increase no matter what they do. The fact is that their skill is beyond their cap, and they must wait until they reach a level where their skill can increase. The maximum skill you can have is 200.
<p>
There are three ways to increase your research skills. The simplest is by using training points with your guild trainer. Although cheap enough at first, this method can become costly at higher levels.
<p>
The second method is to collect the materials needed to create spells and attempt to make them. Just like any trade skill, attempting a combine can bring skill increases regardless of whether you were successful. Also, the higher your intelligence the faster you will learn. 
<p>
The third method is to do "practice research". Since the components needed to create spells may be difficult to gather in the quantities needed to increase your skills, casters have found a way to create "practice runes" which take the place of spell components. By creating practice runes and attempting to combine these as you would to make a spell, you can increase your research skill although you will not create a useful item.
<p>
The books that contain recipes for spell research and practice research are found in the game, usually in the casters guild and also on spell research vendors. Some of these books are written in languages other than Common. The book "On Languages" will tell you what languages are required. 
<p>
<b>Creating Spells</b>
<p>
To create spells, each caster must combine the proper ingredients in their spell research book. The ingredients and the book are different for each class, and each type of caster can only make spells for their own class. Wizards use a Lexicon, Mages use an Elemental Grimoire, Enchanters use the Tome of Endless Enchantments, and Necromancers use the Book of Dark Bindings. These books are bought at the appropriate caster's guild. The books are containers that you hold in your inventory, just like jewelry or sewing kits. To attempt to create a spell, place the appropriate items in the book and hit combine. A successful attempt will place a spell scroll in your inventory.
<p>
In each spell cycle, from level 16 up to 49, there are several spells that can be created by spell research. Not all spells that can be researched have to be researched. For example, the enchanter spell Ultravision can be either created or bought at the gypsy camp in Oasis.
<p>
The items needed to create spells drop off of creatures around the same level as the spell that would be created. Intelligent or highly magical creatures are more likely to drop research components than animals.
<p>
The spells for a spell cycle become trivial when your skill goes beyond the maximum skill for that cycle. For example, when your skill exceeds 40, the cap for level 23, creating level 20 spells will become trivial. Creating higher level spells, for example level 34 spells when you are level 20, will of course give skill increases, but your chance for success will be smaller.
<p>
Spells that can be researched for each class are listed at Caster's Realm.<br>
Mage spell recipes are <a href = "http://eq.castersrealm.com/research/Magician/">here</a>.<br>
Wizard spell recipes are <a href = "http://eq.castersrealm.com/research/Wizard/">here</a>.<br>

Allakhazam's has a list of which spells are research only <a href = "http://mythiran.allakhazam.com/mustresearch.html">here</a>.<br>
<p>
<p><b>Practice Research</b>
<p>
Casters can increase their research skill by creating practice runes in a book called the Concordance of Research, and then placing the runes in their spell research book in place of the normal spell ingredients. Creating practice runes does not give skill increases and is always successful. The skill increase comes from attempting to combine the practice runes in your research book. 
<p>
The Concordance and the two books that list the recipes for practice runes are quest items. To get a Concordance, you must turn in a greater lightstone (found on willowisps) to Mrysila in the North Karana gypsy camp, Synthi in the Oasis gypsy camp or Smith Tv'ysa (evil races) in the South Ro gypsy camp. The Concordance is a container, so you must have an empty inventory slot to hold it. If you turn in a lightstone you will receive one of the two recipe books for practice research. These are regular books and will go inside a backpack. Both of these quests return experience as well as the item.
<p>
For each attempt at practicing research you will need two runes, called Azia and Beza. You make these runes one at a time in the Concordance by combining the appropriate items with a piece of parchment and a quill. All of the items except for the quill are consumed. Since parchment does not stack, you will probably want to collect your recipe ingredients first, then make the runes near the vendor who sells parchment. These vendors are in the casters guilds and also in several other spots around Norrath.
<p>
Once you have made an Azia and Beza rune of the same level, place them in your research book (Tome, Grimoire, whatever...), hit combine and hope for a skill increase. There are practice runes of varying difficulty, so if one becomes trivial, you can move on to a harder type. 
<p>
Caster's Realm has practice research recipes <a href = "http://eq.castersrealm.com/research/research_good.asp">here </a> although be warned that some of the information is outdated. For example, froglok eyes *do* drop in the game now in Guk.

<p><b>How I trained my research skills</b>
<p>
With three different ways of increasing your skill, you may be wondering which works best. In my own experience, practice research was a waste of time. The items required to create the practice runes were either too hard to find or too costly, plus many of the items don't stack. I did not use this method at all after trying it out. Instead, I used training points to increase my skill. Because my research was always maxed, I was fairly successful at making spells with the few components I did come across. By about level 35 though, each practice point cost 15 to 20 pp, so I switched entirely to practicing with spell components. At each level I would max my skills making spells that I could buy anyway, so that failures didn't hurt, and then attempted making the research only spells when I was fairly sure of success.
