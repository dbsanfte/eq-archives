Like sewing, fletching is a portable skill. You need a fletching kit, components either purchased from vendors or made by a blacksmith, and free time. Skill in fletching also allows you to make bows, but since bow components are so much more expensive than fletching components, you want to raise your skill by making arrows and only make the bows once your skill is high enough that they are trivial or nearly so.  Detailed information on bowyering can be found in the guide linked below.<br>

Much of the material in this guide is from the excellent resource that I suggest every fletcher should have bookmarked:

<a href = "http://members.bellatlantic.net/~ewj/fletchguide/index.htm"> Fletching Guide by Aoenla</a><br>

<p><b>Getting Started</b><br>


The first step in a fletching career is buying a fletching kit. As with the sewing kit the fletching kit is a handy portable container (8 slot).  Alas, fletching kits are not sold by fletching vendors; they are sold by bow vendors, who are relatively rare. For our purposes there are four bow vendors in the game:

<p><b>Bow Component Vendors</b><br>


KELETHIN: Merchant Sylnis, standing by a wheelbarrow outside Trueshot Bows (-360, -610)


SOUTH KARANA: The centaur Ulan Meadowgreen, in the centaur village near (120, -2200)


SUREFALL GLADE: Tonsia, inside the Ranger guild house.


FIRIONA VIE: Jessica Winter, inside the Ranger guild, near (-3430, 3315)
<br>
These folks also sell the guides to Bowyering; arrow vendors sell the Fletching guides. When I started fletching I bought one book which combined instructions for both fletching and bowyering. I've never seen it for sale since. I have heard it said that owning these books increases your chance of success in the appropriate skill. I don't know if that is true or not but I bought them just in case.<br>

Once you have the fletching kit now you need arrow parts. Bow vendors do not sell all the arrow parts; you really want to find an arrow vendor. Fortunately these guys are a lot more common than bow vendors. There are good-aligned arrow vendors all over the place:


<p><b>Arrow Component Vendors</b><br>


AK'ANON: Clockwork Bowyer inside (1245, -900)


EAST COMMONS: Joryd Longarms, in Inn 3, near (980, 3760)


EAST KARANA: Bryan, in the shops near the wooden bridge, near (-840, -15)


FELWITHE: Longarrow, in Faydark's Bane in North Felwithe


HALAS: Rain, in McPherson's Bloody Blades


KALADIM: Alanury Stormhammer, in Staff & Spear, in South Kaladim


KELETHIN: Lanin, one platform north of the Priest of Discord lift; Neaien, inside the Fletcher building, same platform as Lanin; Tiladnya, inside Trueshot Bows


KITHICOR FOREST: Krile Arrowsmith, near (-325, 3900)


QEYNOS: Danon Fletcher, standing outside near the large clock in South Qeynos.


SUREFALL GLADE: Jarse Kedison, standing outside near the arrow range; Livam T'Lant, inside the Druid guild.


WEST KARANA: Brenzl McMannus, in the hut near the the ogre shrine, near (-2000, -9000); Barbarian merchant, in the barbarian fishing village on the south shore, near (-3700, -2000)


FIRIONA VIE: Fleceal Summer, inside the Ranger guild, near (-3430, 3315)


Once you've found your arrow vendor, buy one stack of each of four different components, points, shafts, fletches (or vanes), and nocks. I'll refer to this as a set; I tend to think of arrow costs in sets of 20 of each of the four components.<br>


Take one of each component (use ctrl-click to select a single item from a stack) and place it in your fletching kit. Hit combine. If you are successful, five arrows now rest on your cursor. Click on the auto-equip area to drop them into your inventory.<br>


Note that Fletching differs from other trade skills in that successes (getting the product rather than that nasty "You lack the skills" message) are dependent on DEX, not WIS. Skill checks are based on INT as for all trade skills. So you want to try to raise both DEX and INT, and if you are practicing with expensive components, get a friendly Shaman to cast a DEX buff on you (Thanks Dalgar!)<br>

I recommend buying the components that will give you the most bang for the buck. You'll start with the cheapest components; once your skill hits just below the trivial level, buy the next set up in complexity (and price). That way all of the money you put into fletching goes to both make arrows and increase your skill.

<p><b>Method 1:</b><br>

Learning to fletch by fletching for use:<br>

<p><b>Skill 1 to 16:</b> Make basic arrows; these are still better than what you can buy, and cheaper too.<br>


-Field Point, Wood Shaft, Round Fletch, Large Nock: Damage 1, range 50.<br>


Skill 16 to 36: Substitute medium nocks for large nocks and make better arrows.<br>


-Field Point, Wood Shaft, Round Fletch, Medium Nock: Damage 1, range 75.<br>

<p><b>Skill 36 to 46:</b> Substitute parabolic fletches for round fletches and make one of two types of arrow, depending on your pocketbook:<br>

-Field Point, Wood Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, Medium Nock: Damage 1, range 125.<br>

-Field Point, Wood Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, Large Nock: Damage 1, range 100.<br>

Skill 46 to 56:</b> Keep the parabolic fletch and make the longest range arrows possible by switching to a small nock.<br>
-Field Point, Wood Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, Small Nock: Damage 1, range 150.<br>

From this point on, you'll be using parabolic fletches and small nocks for quite some time in your fletching career. Arrow range adds to bow range; a long-range arrow makes a middling bow better and a good bow great. Once you feel out the distance at which you can pop things you'll want to make the longest range arrows possible. Now, the changes you make to your arrows start to increase damage.

<p><b>Skill 56 to 68:</b> Substitute bone shafts for wood ones for a stronger arrow: damage 2, range 150.<br>
-Field Point, Bone Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, Small Nock: Damage 2, range 150.<br>

<p><b>Skill 68 to 102:</b> Here you skip a step. I never used shield fletches; though they increase damage they reduce range by 50, and the tradeoff just is not worth it. Instead we replace the field point with a hooked point, increasing damage by 1. Again you have two choices:<br>

-Hooked Point, Wood Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, Small Nock: Damage 2, range 150.<br>
-Hooked Point, Bone Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, Small Nock: Damage 3, range 150.<br>

(The hooked, bone, para, small arrow is the arrow that I am using now for archery. I think it's a great combination of range and damage for the price.)

<p><b>Skill 102 to 135:</b> We skip a step again. Wood vanes are not as bad as shield fletches; they only reduce range by 25. But that means the longest range arrow you can make with a wood vane is range 75, which is just too short. These arrows are now starting to be pricey. The bone shaft gives way to the ceramic shaft, for plus 2 damage.<br>

-Field Point, Ceramic Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, Small Nock: Damage 2, range 150.<br>
-Hooked Point, Ceramic Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, Small Nock: Damage 4, range 150.<br>
As long as you are spending the cash anyway, I'd make the damage 4 arrows. The hooked points are not that expensive relative to what you are paying for the shafts. This combination is about 30 to 35 plat per set, if I recall correctly.<br>

<p><b>Skill 135 to 162:</b> Now the components are too dear and the skill gap is too large; you take a step back in range and damage and use bone vanes instead of the parabolic fletches. NOTE: Vanes look like shafts, but they replace fletches. Many fletchers have tried to use them as shafts, only to get the "Does not combine" message, which is a disaster given what they cost,<br>
-Field Point, Wood Shaft, Bone Vane, Small Nock: Damage 2, range 125.

<p><b>Skill 162 to 202:</b> There are two reasons to get your fletching skill over 162. One is the ability to make magic arrows which will hit ghouls and the like. The other is to make the high end darkwood bows, which are not trivial even at 202. The cheapest set of components you can buy to increase your skill at this level costs about 66 plat per set. I broke down and started buying components and selling the arrows back to the vendor at this stage.<br>

Arrows to sell back to the vendor:<br>
-Field Point, Wood Shaft, Ceramic Vane, Small Nock: Damage 3, range 50.<br>

Arrows to increase skill and to use:<br>

-Hooked Point, Steel Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, Small Nock: Damage 5, range 150.<br>
-Bladed Point, Steel Shaft, Parabolic Fletch, Small Nock: Damage 6, range 150, magic item.

<p><b>Skill 202 to ??:</b> To date no method of increasing fletching skill beyond 202 has yet been found, other than making darkwood bows, at a minimum of 240 pp per attempt. It is expected that in the promised fletching patch more components will be made available.

<p><b>Method 2:</b><br>
Learning to fletch by selling the products back:<br>

Arrow Component Complexity Values, by cost:<br>

Large Nock         16
Round Fletch         16
Wood Shaft         16
Field Point        16
Medium Nock        36
Parabolic Fletch        46
Small Nock                56
Bone Shaft                68
Shield Fletch        82
Hooked Point        102
Wood Vane                122
Ceramic Shaft        135
Bone Vane                162
Ceramic Vane        202
Steel Shaft        202
Silver Tip                182
<p>
Here is the skill table from Aeonla's guide to fletching. As the skill level to use the component increases so does the cost. Buy the single component you need to increase skill and the cheapest possible other components. This will result in crappy expensive arrows but the vendors will still buy them from you.

<p><b>How I did it:</b><br>

For most of my fletching career, whenever I was out of arrows or had cash to burn I bought one set of components and made them up into arrows, then used them until I was out of arrows again. I skipped the components that were going to make lousy expensive arrows and paid a little extra to make good expensive arrows to raise skill. I did this through skill level 168.<br>

Beyond that the components started costing too much to shoot and I was in a hurry to raise skill so I started buying the cheapest components with which I could increase skill and sold the finished arrows back to the merchant. Since fletching for skill guarantees a certain number of failures, this is a money losing proposition, but it's not as bad as actually shooting damage 3 range 50 arrows that cost you 7 gold apiece.<br>

<p><b>How I wish I had done it:</b><br> 

I'm not unhappy with the way I gained experience in fletching. It is kind of relaxing to sit and meditate and fletch while waiting for mana to recharge. I think folks in a big hurry to gain skill in fletching should use method two. Otherwise, buy a four-stack, make 'em up, use 'em up, repeat as needed. Skip the lousy arrow combos; buy the next highest component to raise skill.<br>

<p><b>Fletching and Blacksmithing:</b><br> 

Since the recent blacksmithing patch it is possible for smiths to make arrow points and shafts. Unfortunately, at least for the basic arrow points it is cheaper to buy them from a NPC vendor than to make them using smithing. This may not be true of the higher end components and Marrie and I should sit down and check that out one of these days.<br>

<p><b>Speed fletching:</b><br> 

If you are really in a hurry to fill a quiver or bag with arrows, this is the way to do it. Make sure all of your inventory slots have something in them. Put your fletching kit in the upper left inventory slot. Purchase one each of the arrow components you are using: these will drop into your fletching kit. Click combine on the kit.<br>

You will get the success or failure message, but nothing will appear on your cursor. That's ok, click on your auto-equip area anyway. The arrows you just made will appear in your inventory. Close out the merchant screen, take the arrows and put one in every slot you want to fill with arrows (so one per quiver slot, for example). Note that arrows will fill the ammo slot first<br>. 

Once you have one arrow or more in every slot that gets arrows, resume buying components, combining them, and clicking on the auto-equip area while in the merchant screen. Every slot with a single arrow will gradually fill with arrows; once all of the slots are full, a set of arrows will appear in your fletching kit. Stop fletching, you have just enough.<br>
