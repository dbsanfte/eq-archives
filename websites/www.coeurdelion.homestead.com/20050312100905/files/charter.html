	<b>Purpose: </b><p>


Coeur de Lion exists to provide aid and succor to its members and to the citizenry of Norrath. It shall be a Good-aligned guild, which members forswear evil and fight it throughout Norrath in all its guises. Members of Coeur de Lion shall offer such aid as is in their power to any of their brotherhood who ask it and respect the various beliefs of their guildmates. Members of Coeur de Lion shall not take the rightful prey of others, and shall act with honor and courtesy. Any intelligent creature who will swear to the power of Good, the defense of the helpless and the support of the brotherhood may join.<p>




<b>Members:</b><p>


Anyone who displays the qualities of a Lionheart: gallantry, honor, and duty; and who is willing to abide by the rules of the guild may join. Any guild member may sponsor a prospective member and testify to their fitness for the guild. The sponsor shall introduce the prospective member to the guild and ensure that he or she understands what is expected of him or her and what they can expect in return. Prospective members will then meet with guild officers. Once two officers second the admission of a citizen into the guild, he or she shall be admitted without delay. <b>Prospective members should be in their 46th level before admission to the guild, though exceptions can be made to this requirement.</b> Persons invited to Coeur de Lion will be on probation for one month; at the end of the month at the officers regular meeting they will be revoted. If something has come to light in that time period that the officers feel cannot be resolved then the probationary member will be asked to leave Coeur de Lion.<p>


Any member may leave the guild at any time without prejudice, though it is to be hoped that they will give a guild officer their reasons for leaving so that the guild may be improved. A member who cannot leave on their own for whatever reason can petition a guild officer, who will remove them at their request without comment. A member who wishes to return to the guild after leaving will be admitted only after unanimous approval by the officers. A member who guildremoves a second time is considered a new applicant and must go through the usual admissions process. Members may also be banished for breaking the guild rules, but only the guildmaster may remove a member in that case. <p> 




<b>Rules:</b><p>


Members of Coeur de Lion will aid their guildmates. If a guild member requires rescue -- immediate aid -- any other member in the same or a nearby zone is requested and required to assist in any way possible. This includes leaving camps and hunting groups. If a member is unable to help in a rescue, they should state why they cannot aid their brother (they are too low a level or KOS in the area, for example). Failure to come to the aid of a guildmate without good and just cause is a punishable offense.  <p>


Whenever possible, assistance should be scheduled by the person requesting aid. No member should call for rescue if it is not vital. Calling for immediate aid without good and just reason is a punishable offense. <p>


Aid should also be offered to guildmates in the form of sponsorship, help with questing, discounted prices on items, offering items first to the membership, sharing, and generally looking out for one another. Aid to other citizens of Norrath should be offered as may be possible, taking into account individual circumstances. <p>


Members of Coeur de Lion will respect their guildmates. Behavior upsetting to other members should be discontinued on a polite request. If an argument cannot be resolved peaceably it should be brought to a guild officer or to the guildmaster for adjudication. Continuing in offensive behavior after a request to stop is a punishable offense.  <p>


Members of Coeur de Lion will not kill-steal or do any act of deliberate evil. All of these are punishable offenses.<p>




<b>Penalties:</b><p>


Any citizen of Norrath may bring a complaint to any guild officer against any member. Any member hearing such complaint should alert the nearest guild officer, who should contact the injured party directly. If the guild officer believes that the complaint is valid, he or she should gather the pertinent information, contact two other officers and with them judge the circumstances and the complaint. They shall then contact the guildmaster with their findings and a recommended penalty. The guildmaster is responsible for meting out any penalty to the offending member and contacting the complainant and informing them of the guild's decision. <p> 


Penalties for breaking the rules of the guild may include fines (to be paid fittingly); shunning (no guild contact and/or aid for a specified time period); or in extreme cases banishment from the guild. Penalties are at the discretion of the guildmaster.<p>  


In the case when a complaint is made against the guildmaster, the same procedures shall apply, but the heir shall be
contacted with the officers' findings and recommendations and the heir shall mete out any punishment and inform the complaintant of the guild's decision.<p>




<b>Guild Officers:</b><p>


Guild officers will include the guildmaster, his or her heir, five officers appointed by the guildmaster and other officers selected by the membership. These officers shall comprise the privy council, the entire membership being the council. <p>


Guild officers shall lead by example, striving to embody the virtues of a Lionheart: honor, integrity, bravery, courtesy, and loyalty. They shall enforce and uphold the charter, amending and clarifying it as necessary. They shall assist members in achieving their goals and quests, by teaching skills and tactics, organizing raids and hunts, and providing other support as needed. They shall assist in resolving disputes between members and between members and citizens. Officers shall contact, inform and evaluate prospects; they shall guildinvite prospects that have been accepted for membership. Officers shall act as liaisons to other guilds and as representatives to the various councils of Morell-Thule.<p>


They shall provide advice and feedback to the guildmaster in regular officers' meetings and in emergency sessions when required. Should an officer not attend the regular weekly officers meetings for a period of four months, said officer will be considered to have tendered their resignation and will be removed from the ranks of the officers, though they will still be a member in good standing of the guild.<p>


The first guildmaster shall be the person who submits the guild for approval to Verant. The guildmaster shall serve until he or she voluntarily steps down or is removed from office. At the time of his or her accession to the office of guildmaster, each master will choose a successor who shall be the heir to the office.<p>


The guildmaster shall appoint five officers. These officers shall serve until they choose to step down or until they are removed from office. The guildmaster will appoint a replacement for any of these five officers upon their leaving the privy council.<p>


At any time a group of ten or more members may petition for representation on the privy council by naming one of their number to be elected as a guild officer. Upon receipt of the petition, the guildmaster shall make the named member a guild officer. Said officer shall serve until he or she voluntarily steps down or is removed from office. These officers may only be replaced by petition.<p>  




<b>Removal of Officers:</b><p>


The guildmaster can be removed from office for failure to carry out his or her duties as described in this charter or for disregarding the rules of the guild. Any member may petition for the removal of the guildmaster by contacting the heir to the office. Upon receipt of the petition, the privy council will vote on the removal. The vote will take place over the period of one week (seven consecutive days). Any officers failing to vote in that time will be said to abstain. At the end of the voting period the votes will be tallied by the heir and the result announced to the membership. A simple majority is required for removal. If the guildmaster is removed from office, he or she will step down and the heir will be named guildmaster.<p>


The heir can be removed from office by the choice of the guildmaster, with the approval of the privy council. A new heir shall be named by the guildmaster to the privy council and the council shall vote to approval the choice by a simple majority in a one week vote as above. Once the new heir is approved he or she shall replace the former heir, who shall be removed as a guild officer. <p> 


Any guild officer can be removed from office for failure to carry out his or her duties as described in this charter or for disregarding the rules of the guild. Any member may petition for the removal of a guild officer by contacting the guildmaster. Upon receipt of the petition, the privy council will vote on the removal. The vote will take place over the period of one week (seven consecutive days). Any officers failing to vote in that time period will be said to abstain. At the end of the voting period the votes will be tallied by the guildmaster and the result announced to the membership. A simple majority is required for removal. <p>




<b>Guild Wars:</b><p>


In the rare case that it may be necessary to declare a guild war, the guildmaster shall consult with the privy council and with the membership. The support of a majority of the membership is recommended to declare guild war. Any guild war must be announced to the membership at least once per day for 3 consecutive days before the war may commence.<p>




<b>Charter Amendments:</b><p>


Any guild officer or any five members by petition can propose an amendment to the charter. Once the amendment proposal is received by the guildmaster he or she will broadcast the proposal to the membership at least once per day for 3 consecutive days. Passage of the proposal will be by voice vote of all members over the period of one week (seven consecutive days) starting on the third day of the broadcast. At the end of the voting period the votes will be tallied and the result announced to the membership. A two-thirds majority vote is required for approval of the amendment. If it is approved, the charter will be amended effective immediately. <p>
