	<p>
	There are many quests in Norrath and many reasons for completing them, faction and items being the most common. While we encourage and assist people in attaining their goals, there are some restrictions on questing mandated by our charter.
	</p>
<p>
The charter of Coeur de Lion states that members of Coeur de Lion will not kill anything that is commonly held to be good. This means that if your quest calls for you to kill by your Hand a person or being commonly held to be good you cannot complete the 
quest. If the person or being you have to kill is commonly held to be good but there is evidence that they have committed crimes against one of the good cities of Norrath or humanity as a whole, then it is acceptable to kill this person or being.
<p>
Any quest that requires you to gain an item from a good NPC or creature by killing him and the item can be gained by other means can still be completed. If the item can be purchased, then that tack can be taken and should be. There are members of the guild that will help raise the needed coin if a member is short. If the NPC / Creature is commonly killed and the item left to rot there is no evil is salvaging said item from the corpse before it goes away.
	<p>
	We place no restrictions on members as far as their factions go; if you wish to do a quest that endears you to evil creatures you may. However, we do restrict what you can kill to perform a quest: no member may kill a creature commonly considered good. Since there are many interlocking factions, you can't always rely on conning a creature to determine whether it is good or evil. It also means that you should investigate the backgrounds of creatures you need to kill. If in doubt whether a creature is good or evil, please bring the issue to the officers.
	</p>
	<p><b>What does this mean in practice?</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	It means that there are some quests CdL members may not be able to complete.
	</p>
	<p>
	Creatures commonly considered good are all "good" and "neutral" races: Humans, Barbarians, Erudites, Wood Elves, Half Elves, High Elves, Halflings, Dwarves, Gnomes and Vah Shir. Killing a member of any of these races is prohibited unless you can prove that they have turned to evil. For example, the human bandits in the Karanas may be killed (they are lawbreakers) as can Erudite necromancers (they practice the dark arts). NPCs in the company of evil creatures are usually considered evil by association. See also the section below on Luclin factions.
</p>
<p>
	Evil races are Trolls, Ogres, Iksar and Teir'Dal. There is no prohibition against killing members of any of these races. However, we do not condone camping the guards in newbie areas, as the young of any race deserve protection. If you wish to hunt guards, you should also assume guard duty until the natural guards of the area return.
</p>
<p>
Undead are considered evil despite their race while living since their existence is a perversion of the natural cycle of death and rebirth.
</p>
<p>
	Intelligent NPC races are considered at best neutral. This includes races such as giants, lizardmen, frogloks, kobolds, orcs and aviaks. CdL members may kill these creatures if they wish. There has been a great deal of discussion about whether the Frogloks of Guk are evil since they start out indifferent to most races. Careful exploration of Guk has revealed that there are shadowknights and necromancers among their ranks, and that they torture their prisoners. Therefore we consider them evil.
</p>
<p>
	Animals are considered neutral, unless there is a strong fantasy tradition supporting their alignment. Bears and wolves are protected by rangers and druids, so most CdL members refrain from killing them except in self defense. Unicorns and Pegasi are considered good and may not be killed. However, the black unicorns in Wakening Lands and the Plane of Growth are evil.
</p>
<p>
Treants may not be killed, except for the evil one that roams Karana's plains.
</p>
<p>
The gnomish pirates in Velious should not be killed as there is some question about whether they are truly pirates, or merely gnomish adventurers pretending to be pirates.
</p>
<p>
<b>What quests are affected?</b>
</p>
<p>
At the moment these are the only quests that CdL members may be tempted to complete that require them to kill good creatures. Please bear in mind that any quest requiring you to kill an obviously good creature is also proscribed (such as killing Coldain to obtain their heads for Kael quests).
</p>
<p>
The Mage epic -- Quillmane may not be killed by a member of CdL.
</p>
<p>
The Shaman epic -- Tabien the Goodly may not be killed.
</p>
<p>
The Cloak of Truth (Luclin) -- Pequi the gnome in Shadowhaven may not be killed. 
</p>
Paladin Ro Armor - the clockworks may not be killed.
<p>
<b>Velious Factions and Zones</b>
<p>Coeur de Lion does not require members to belong to a particular Velious faction. Some members chose faction based on in-character reasons, others do not. The Coldain dwarves of the Crystal Caverns and Thurgadin are considered good and may not be killed.  CdL members wishing to build Kael faction may purchase dwarf heads or loot them from the monsters in the Thurgadin sewers. Both Kromriff and Kromzek are neutral. Since these followers of Rallos Zek were never cursed by the gods the way the giants of the old world continents were, we consider them neutral. CdL members may kill them if they wish. All dragons may be killed. Members of Coeur de Lion may not hunt in Tunare's Plane of Growth as most of the creatures there are sacred to her.
</p>
<p>
<b>Luclin Faction</b>
Coeur de Lion's research into the societies of Luclin has lead us to ally with the people of Katta against Sanctus Seru. Citizens of Seru as well as their agents may be killed. The Recuso are victims of the unjust government of Sanctus Seru and should not be killed.<p>
