<i><p>
Norrath is full of terror and beauty, and for day to day hunting we wish to see it in 
 as much detail as possible. When too many people are gathered in one place 
though, whether it is for a raid or a GM event, there is so much information being 
sent to our computers that lag spikes and linkdeaths become common, and slower 
computers may have trouble displaying all the graphics.
 We have found that using the following settings on raids helps significantly. They can be put on a hotkey for 
convenience.
</i></p></font>

<h4>Raid Settings</h4>
<font class ="content">
<p>
1. The most useful thing you can do to reduce lag on a slow computer is to <b>turn off all Luclin models</b>. This is 
done before connecting to the Login Server. When you start Everquest, click Options and follow the menus through
to the model page. Uncheck all models and continue to log in normally.
</p>
<p>
2. Type:<br>
<b>/showspelleffects OFF<br>
/dynamiclights OFF<br>
/shownames 1 or OFF</b>
</p>
<p>
These turn all spell particle effects off and turns off lighting effects from anything you're carrying. The /shownames command shortens the names displayed above players' heads to first name only (/shownames 1) or turns it off completely.<br> Changing your /dynamiclights setting doesn't take effect until you zone, so you need to type this <i>before</i> entering the raid zone. 
</p>
<p>
3. Some classes should type:<br>
<b>/serverfilter ON</b>
</p>
<p>
Healers should NOT turn on server filtering, as they will not receive updates to the health bars often enough 
to keep people alive. This command causes the server to filter chat commands, hits, misses, etc but it also 
reduces the frequency of updates to health bars. Healers can sit facing a blank wall or spellbook to ease the 
graphics load on their computer.
</p>
<p>
4. <b>Turn off unnecessary chat channels</b>. If you have /serverfilter on, this will reduce the amount of information sent to your computer, otherwise, it merely reduces battle spam on your screen.<br>
Go to windowed screen mode (hit F10 twice from full screen mode)<br>
Under Options/Chat:
<ul>
<li>Turn off any chat options that you don't need, such as /auc, /shout, /ooc, and chat channels you may have autojoined.
<li>Turn off all nonessential battle messages - My misses, others misses, attacker missing me.
<li>Some battle messages may be useful to some classes but not others, so use your own judgement on these - Others Hits, PC spells, NPC spells, Bard songs, Damage Shields.</ul>
</p>
<p>
5. <b>For players with slower processors or video cards:</b><br>
Under Options/Display:
<ul><li>Sky  3D sky: OFF.
<li>Particle Density: OFF (typing /particleden off does the same thing.
<li>Clip Plane:  slide towards the left. Objects farther away than the clip plane are not displayed.
<li>Gamma  Slide: to the right to compensate for turning off your lights.</ul>
</p>
<p>
6.<b> Other Settings</b>
</p>
<p>
At the beginning of a raid the main assist and secondary assist will be announced. Please set up hot keys with /assist <main assist> and /assist <secondary assist>. These keys should be your only method of selecting targets.<br>
The raidleader will announce the name of the channels that the raid will be talking in. Certain classes may be asked to put messages on these channels. If you are unfamiliar with how to do this, ask your groupleader for assistance.<br>
If there is a chance that you will be Feared or Charmed during a fight, you may be asked to set yourself to Walk rather than Run.<br> 
</p>
<p>
<h4>Setting up your User Interface</h4>
</p>
<p>
There are many options for customizing the user interface. We have gathered some of the more useful commands 
here.
</p>
<p>
<font class = "subhead1"><b>Text Colors<br></b></font>
Format: /usercolor <channel number> R G B<br>
/usercolor changes the color of the specified type of messages. For example, /ooc is channel 5, so you could 
change all /ooc messages in your chat window to red by typing /usercolor 5 255 0 0. R G B codes are explained 
below. A list of useful channel numbers also follows.
</p>
<p>
<font class = "subhead1"><b>Window Color<br></b></font>
Format : /wincolor <window name> R G B T
</p>
<p>
This command lets you control the background color and transparency of each window in full screen mode. The 
names of the windows you can change are: chat, spell, main, hotbox, player, target, inv (inventory), buff, 
data, track, all. R G B are the red, green and blue components of the color you want the window to be, and are 
explained below. T is the tranparency, and ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 4 (completely opaque). 
The example below turns all windows completely transparent, then makes the chat window a slightly see through 
black. In a snowy dungeon you might want the chat window darker so the text will show up better. <br>
/wincolor all 0 0 0 0 <br>
/wincolor chat 0 0 0 2
</p>
<p>
<font class = "subhead1"><b>Color Codes<br></b></font>
The /usercolor and /wincolor commands use RGB color codes. RGB stands for Red Green Blue, and every color is a 
mixture of these three. You can tell how much of each color you want by typing a number between 0 and 255, 0 
being none of that color, and 255 being a lot. So, to make pure bright red, use 255 0 0. To make dull red use 
125 0 0.
Mixing light is not like mixing pigments; for example adding lots of red and some green, gives you orange, 
not brown.
</p>
<p>
A complete color chart can be found <a href = "http://eq.castersrealm.com/colorwizard/colorchart.asp"> here </a>.
 We've included some common colors codes below: <br>
<font color = "#FF0000">Red 255 0 0</font><br>

<font color = "#F0F000">Bright yellow 240 240 0</font><br>
