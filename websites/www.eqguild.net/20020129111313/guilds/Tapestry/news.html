<blockquote><font color="#FFCC33">January 27, 2002</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">I put up a page for our newest honorary member.&nbsp;
<a href="jarod.html">Check it out</a>.&nbsp; Pics to come soon (maybe tommorow).</font><font color="#FFCC33"></font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33">January 26, 2002</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">My first child comes home today, beginning the
new chapter in my story.&nbsp; I cannot explain in words how happy I am
that everything is going well, and my joy at seeing my son's face.&nbsp;
For the longest time, I have watched my Everquest family grow, and now
I will get to watch my son grow as well.&nbsp; Hopefully I will get to
talk to all of you soon, as I already miss talking to you.&nbsp; But soon
I will have more on my hands than guild matters! lol.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">So, I am hoping that my new Admirals are serving
you well.&nbsp; I trust that they are.&nbsp; When all the "chaos" has died
down over here, and life gets back to "order", you will see more of me.&nbsp;
But for now, my son and fianc&eacute; get my full attention, and I know
all of you will understand.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I am still working on the pictures, so those of
you waiting to see the baby pictures, give me a few more days! lol.&nbsp;
'Till then, good luck and happy hunting!!</font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33">January 24, 2002</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">A special day for Megina and myself.&nbsp; Baby
Kortap has entered this world.&nbsp; After a long day laboring, Jarod Robert
came into this world at 9:52pm CST.&nbsp; Mother and baby are doing just
fine.&nbsp; More news and pictures will follow soon, so keep checking back!</font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33">January 22, 2002</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">The first order of business is to announce that
baby Kortap will be here before the end of the week.&nbsp; Megina has some
kidney complications that sent her to the hospital today, and the doctor
says he's gonna induce before the end of the week.&nbsp; So with that news,
I must also tell you that my playing time will be reduced for the next
couple of weeks.&nbsp; Understandably, I felt the need to leave someone
in charge while I was away.&nbsp; Someone who could speak for me, and make
decisions for me.&nbsp; So with that in mind, I announce that 3 members
have been promoted to a special position in the guild that was created
for this time.&nbsp; The position of Admiral.&nbsp; These Admirals will
be my right hands, helping to promote a good guild, and good guild practices.&nbsp;
They are acting council on all matters pertaining to the guild.&nbsp; As
of now, they are the ruling body.&nbsp; I will announce to all my official
return.&nbsp; Till then, these 3 are the ones in charge.&nbsp; Treat them
appropriately.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">And now, for the names....</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Congratulations to Arghy, Mawr and Perda!!!!&nbsp;
My new Admirals.&nbsp; Please respect them as you would me, for they hold
the guild in their hands the next few weeks, as life here tumbles into
new baby chaos!! lol.</font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33">January 13, 2002</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Well, I finally got around to alphabetizing the
Heroes page.&nbsp; Should be easier to see.&nbsp; I also started cleaning
up and standardizing the individual pages.&nbsp; This should be complete
in the next couple days.&nbsp; Which brings me again to mentioning:&nbsp;
GET YOUR INFO TO ME!!!! ASAP!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">If any of you write or would like to create your
character's page on your end, I will take those as well.&nbsp; Just email
me your html, and I'll get it up.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Also, the raid calendar is a up, but still a work
in progress.&nbsp; If you have an idea for a raid, please post it in the
form, and I'll get it up ASAP.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">One last note:&nbsp; Sometime near the end of
this month, we will have a new honorary member of&nbsp; Tapestry of Heroes.&nbsp;
That's right... Kortap is going to be a daddy!!&nbsp; So, please bear with
me for a bit, as things are expectedly hectic around here!!&nbsp; If you
really want to know, the mother in this is Megina (I couldn't resist her
wood elf charm!!).&nbsp; She is an alt of mine, but she plays on occasion.&nbsp;
I'm sure you'll see more of her and less of me when our little bundle is
born, but that is yet to see.</font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33">January 4, 2002</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Wow, it felt weird to write that.&nbsp; Happy
New Year everyone.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I have added an armory page for gear that the
guild has for all of us to use.&nbsp; Please check it out.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I am working on a calendar for us to use to plan
raids.&nbsp; I am not sure when I will get it working, but hopefully soon!!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I'm still looking for ideas for our charter.&nbsp;
If you have any, <a href="mailto:to_heroes@charter.net?subject=Charter ideas">email</a>
me!!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">One last thing:&nbsp; In case you wonder about
our country, I saw <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/01/04/ret.bin.laden.leaflets/index.html">this</a>
today, and was very frightened at our government.&nbsp; This sounds like
something out of "1984" by George Orwell.&nbsp; Check it out.</font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33">December 26, 2001</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Was having some difficulty this morning with
trying to wiggle my images around.&nbsp; I hope I have fixed the problem.&nbsp;
Please let me know if I have missed one.&nbsp; Thanks!!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Also, I hope all of you had a Merry X-mas.</font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33">December 22, 2001</font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF">Recently added this news page (*giggle*)&nbsp;
and a link to make submitting your info painless.&nbsp; Please take the
time to visit it <a href="http://fs3.formsite.com/to_heroes/to_heroes/index.html">here</a>.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">I also added a page to help you set up an anonymous
email.&nbsp; That way, I can keep in touch with all of you easier.&nbsp;
Please take the time to do so ASAP as it would really help me out.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">And finally, I added a links page to keep you
in the loop game wise.&nbsp; Feel free to use the links as they will help
make your gaming much more fun!!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Also, if you have any suggestions for this thing
(meaning the website and/or guild), please feel free to email me.&nbsp;
I promise I won't bite.... much!</font></blockquote>
