        This morning I got a notice--my first e-mail ever for Japonica@eqguild.net. &nbsp; Awesome. &nbsp;I rushed over here first thing to pick it up, typed in my username and pw into the little e-mail box on the front page. <br> <br>"Restricted access. &nbsp;Enter Login Name and Password." <br> <br>I did it again. <br> <br>"Password denied." <br> <br>I did it again. <br> <br>"Password denied." <br> <br>Not wanting to beat my head against a brick wall further, I decided that my best option would be to IM Opal. &nbsp;Unfortunately, she's not around. &nbsp;So here I am, searching for help. <br> <br>Help!
