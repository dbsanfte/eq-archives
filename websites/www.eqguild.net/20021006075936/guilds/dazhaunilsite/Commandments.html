  Proper service in the Eyes of Innoruuk is expressed by
  three commandments. In Neriak, past the Third Gate, in the Black
  Library, there is a small chamber. In that most holy chamber
  stands a pedestal, and on that pedestal rests the Great Pact.
  Here is written in the Ancient Tongue the Commandments of
  Innoruuk by His own Hand. These are the foundations of the
  Church, and must be followed above all else. I set forth here, in
  plain and modern language, the Commandments:

  All Teir`Dal were
  created only for the fulfillment of the Will of Innoruuk. We
  exist only to do so. We do not follow the Will. We ARE the Will.
  We cannot be separated from the Father, and free-will is not a
  burden We carry. We are not troubled by questions of right and
  wrong as are mortals. We simply do the Will of Our Father, and in
  this We are superior.
  <p>
  Each Teir`Dal is given a
  purpose in the Will even before their birth. We Children must
  follow Our purpose, for only in it will the Will be realized.
  Above all others, some purposes are great, and are called the
  High Purposes. They are enumerated in the Litany of Purpose and
  are as follows, in descending order:
  <p>
  <b><font color="#3A7277">The Queen and
  King:</font></b> Eternal Mother and Father to Us all. They are pure, and
  beyond reproach.
  <p>
  <b><font color="#3A7277">Clerics:</font></b> They are the
  mouth of Innoruuk and speak His Words. They insure that Children
  do not stray from the Father, and that the body does not falter
  in the Will. They are one with the Father and above all others in
  understanding of the Will. They are His embodiment in this world.
  <p>
  <b><font color="#3A7277">Necromancers:</font></b> Their
  purpose is to command the dead in the service of the Will. Death
  is no excuse to be released from the Will. The dead must serve
  the Father as in life. There can be no rest until the End. They
  also bind the dead of the Hated Others to the Service of
  Innoruuk, and are to be revered.
  <p>
  <b><font color="#3A7277">Shadowknights:</font></b> They are
  the Soldiers of Innoruuk. They are the holy guardians of the
  Priesthood, and the swordarm of the highest servants of the
  Father. They are unwavering in their purpose and are blessed in
  the Eyes of Innoruuk.
  <p>
  <b><font color="#3A7277">Warriors:</font></b> They are the
  shield of the Queen and King. They are strong among the Children,
  and full of Hate. Their purpose it to cut down the\par enemies of
  the Will and before them none shall stand.</font></p>
  <p>
  All purposes serve the
  Will of Innoruuk, but these shall be set above all others as most
  holy.

  <a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>
  </center>
  
  Teir`Dal shall not raise
  word, hand, or sword against Teir`Dal. All are Sisters and
  Brothers in the Will of the Father. Those that turn away from the
  Will, however, shall be considered Spurned, and shall be treated
  as are the Hated Others. The Will shall always remain open to
  them, however, and if the Spurned turns back to the Will of the
  Father, they shall be allowed admittance to all but the highest
  mysteries of the Church, as befits the purity of their blood.
  <p>

  <a name="third"><b><font color="#3A7277">THE THIRD COMMANDMENT: PURITY</font></b></a><br>
  <a href="#top">Return to Top</a><p>
  </center>
  
  The teachings of the
  Church shall not be kept from any who are called to the Will of
  the Father. Therefore, all who turn from the lying gods and turn
  to the True Father may be taught of the Will, regardless what
  race they call Mother. However, those not of purest Teir`Dal
  blood shall not be taught the inner mysteries, nor allowed entry
  into the Third Gate or the Church of the Firstborn. They shall
  also not partake of the Greater Ceremonies, nor be bound by the
  Commandments of Obedience to the Father. In short, they may be
  taught Our Father's use for them, but they are not to be admitted
  into the Circle of His Children.
  <p>
  Those that stand against
  the Father shall be damned. They are the Hated Others. All shall
  be reviled and destroyed. Hatred shall be spread among them and
  they shall perish from inside as well as from out. No mercy shall
  be shown them, and none shall be suffered to live.
  <p>
  Thus are the Words of
  Our Father. Thus are His Commandments to Us.
