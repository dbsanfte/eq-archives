<p><a name="lightdark">Epistle of L'vanon, Firstborn Priest,
<br>to Day Dwellers: On Light and Dark</a>

<p>As I have stated before, the properties of mundane light-bearing bodies and their effect on<br> natural
darkness have absolutely NO connection to matters of spirituality, but since so many<br> day dwelling fools persist in this charade, I must again attempt to put it to rest.

<p>&quot;THERE CAN BE NO DARKNESS WITHOUT
LIGHT!!&quot; Cries the monk. 

<p>&quot;ALL SHADOWS ARE CAST BY A
LIGHT!!&quot; Shouts the paladin.

<p>I am tired of these words being spewed from the mouths of the pompous. They assail my ears<br> like an ill-tuned trumpet. If you must use weak metaphors to illustrate your beliefs, at least let them<br> be accurate in their own right. Here, in the interest of Gnomish science, as well as theology, are <br>commonly accepted and accurate facts about light and the absence thereof:

<p>1: Without the existence of a light-bearing object, the natural state of the universe is<br>
darkness. This is easily proven.

<p>2: No presently known object will shed light indefinitely. All lights die out eventually leaving<br> darkness. This has been observed by Gnomish astronomers to be true even of the stars in heaven.<br> Light is therefore an artificial change in the universe. Darkness is intruded upon by light, which eventually<br> dies to be replaced by the same darkness that existed before.

<p>Now, again I point out that I do not feel that these facts have any bearing whatsoever on the<br> struggle between my Father and other gods, and the fact that We dwell in darkness and Our enemies <br>do not is equally unimportant. Even so, the smallest child can see how poor a point is made by comparing<br> the strength of a god to the permanence of light. Surely even a day dweller can concoct better lies<br> than this! I suggest you leave this child' s game, and invent more accurate religious rhetoric.

<p><a name="enlightenment">Epistle of Aedare,<br>
Human servant of Innoruuk,<br>
to an Unbeliever: On enlightenment<br></a>

<p>Ignoring, for a moment, your blasphemy about the Father being ruler of Envy, perhaps you should
reconsider your assumptions. After all, you speak of honor as if talking to one who does not understand it, and you assume that I am but a common urchin. Let me see now how the story goes: A poor, lost orphaned soul, perhaps taken in by a struggling rogue and beggar to be his servant. Freed from her pitiful existence by a dark elf who, in return for her life, demands that she follow Innoruuk? Knowing no other way of life, at the age of six, she is forced into the service of the Shadow Knights...and, blah, blah, blah. Feh... do you not think I grew up on such stories? Hear the truth, Elf Lord, and despair. 
<p>
I was not beaten as a child; paladins of the Lightbringer do not punish their children so. Aye, paladins- and not just a mere weak paladin of Mithaniel Marr, but the Head of the Order. Aye, his wife was a lesser sister in Mithaniel's clerics, but their love was that of legends. And I heard the legends; how my father rescued my mother from the claws of vicious Orcs, who were planning to tear her limb from limb; how he challenged their leader to an unarmed duel, and, with the Blessing of Marr, succeeded in slaying them all with his bare hands when they turned against him. I not only heard those stories, I believed them all.
<p>
In fact, on my sixteenth birthday, I would have followed my mother to become one of the Sisterhood. I wished to be, as she was, a wandering scholar, bringing the light of Justice to a world grown black with pain. "Ah," I hear you say now, "Assuredly her parents were killed, and she was tortured into her beliefs." Nay. 
<p>
As I have said before, I was met by a Dark Elf. I was young and foolish, and ready to do combat with her. She dropped her weapon, and I remember clearly what she said to me, as though it were yesterday. "Child," she said, "Do you know why you wish to fight me? Is it because you fear and hate me, or because you have been taught to fear and hate me? Do you follow your god because his is the path you wish to take, or the path you have been told to take? You are told you have free will, but have you ever been given a choice?" And with that she smiled, holding her arms out. "I am your prisoner, to do with as you wish. Perhaps you should discover the bars that make your prison." 
<p>
That was not the reason my mind changed; and do not think I am so stupid as to have been bewitched by her magic. No, I took her words as a challenge. I went to my father, and told him that I wished to know all there was to know about all the Gods in the pantheon. He was greatly pleased, thinking that, by understanding the ways of the other Gods, I could better serve his lord, Mithanial. So, I began studying.
<p>
Naturally, I had no difficulty learning of Tunare, Erolissi, Mithaniel, Karana, Prexus, and Quellious. In their own way, they all might as well be the same god, so similar are their scriptures. I had to travel to the Northlands to learn of Rallos Zek, and to Erudin to learn of Solusek Ro. The Tribunal's lessons are in the Great Citadel of the Dwarven City, and in my travels, I came across many followers of strange Rodcet Nife. As my understanding grew, my thirst for understanding grew as well. It was easy to find the tales of the True Gods, as I believed them, but what of the False Gods? What of the lessons of Bertoxxulous, Bristlebane, Cazic-Thule? I knew these to be the enemy, but I did not know why. Are we not to know our enemy? And what of Brell Serilis? The ancient texts say that he led the True Gods to Norrath after Great Veeshan left her brood... why is the knowledge of him forbidden? 
<p>
I knew of only one place where all my answers could be found. So, I found my way to the dungeons- and thinking back, is it not odd that the Church has dungeons? That the giving of the Gift of Light must be done through punishment? And is it not also odd that the Dark Sister, the Dark Elf who started me on my path, was so severely beaten as to be barely alive? She guided me down dark tunnels, into the underbelly of the City. She held at bay those who wished me harm, despite my repeated warnings that I did what I did to crush her kind. And, under the watchful eye of the man who later would become my Shadow Knight guildmaster, I read texts copied from the Black Library of Neriak. 
<p>
Again your foolish mouth will spout defenses. How the library is filled with black sorcery, and how the words of dark elves cannot be trusted. How only the words of the Dark One is in those libraries. Again, I point you to the words of your Goddess, or one of her accomplices: "Know your enemy." These were not texts from the Dark Elves... aye, there were some of them, but not all. There were books by Erudian scholars, by wandering Half-Elven minstrels, and Gnomish Scientists (whatever that truly means.) Works of Elves, Gnomes, Halflings, Dwarves, Humans... works of Orc and Gnoll, Kobold and Ogre. The High Elves are supposed to be the most learned race in all of Norrath... can you honestly say that your libraries hold
so much information? And, no, I did not simply read of Innoruuk, as I'm sure you misinterpret. I read of all the Gods, the Gods that you "accept" and the Gods you refuse to acknowledge. I took copious notes, still intending to use them to aid my quest against the Darkness. 
<p>
Two years later, on my eighteenth birthday, I was still considering the words I had learned. The Dark Elf was returned to captivity, of course; I was a loyal daughter. But the things she had taught me could not be caged; that there were worlds upon worlds out there, and that all the Gods had their ways and paths. And, as I walked down the path to become one of the Sisterhood, as I was being handed my ceremonial robe, it occurred to me the truth: All the Gods are lying sacks of slime. They are all false, all lying. They all claim that you have free will, that you choose their way because you wish it, not because they demand it; that you are free to move around the world, learn whatever you wish, unhampered by their desires and motives. This is a lie- they all demand obedience, they all demand subservience, they demand that you spend every ounce of your strength turning your fellow man away from their god and to yours. They are all false, except one:
<p>
Innoruuk. The Father does not lie. He makes sure you understand the truth: that His way is the only way. You will accept the path He gives you, or you will die. And in Death, you will serve
unquestioningly as well. Yes, his way is the same as all other Gods, but he doesn't try and sugarcoat his words. Can you deny, High Elf, that Tunare's way is not the same? Either follow her, or one of her accomplices, or be destroyed? I have seen too many Orcs, Gnolls, aye, even Ogres and Trolls, felled to believe otherwise. 
<p>
The Father makes it very clear: you follow his path, or you are slain. He does not rely on accomplices; although the followers of some gods may be tools, they can be discarded as the Father decrees. Oh, I could go into further detail; exactly how I told my birthfather and birthmother exactly where they could put their religion. I could tell stories of my initiation into the Shadow Knights that would make your ears curl. But all you need to know is what you have already heard. 
<p>
And this: The Militia of Freeport know me for what I am, and perhaps they may harm me. The Paladins and Clerics of the Temple of Marr cannot. My poor, poor father and his wife live every day hoping that their "lost daughter" will find her way back to Mithaniel's arms. So, no, Elf, I was not beat as a child; I had a happy childhood, until I learned that your false Mother was keeping me... forgive the turn of phrase, but "In the Dark". And I am not lost - not anymore. I follow the Path and the Way.
<p>
And I am truly happy.

<p><a name="lovecompassion">Epistle of L'vanon,<br>
Firstborn Priest,<br>
to a High Elf and other Daydwellers:<br>
On Love and Compassion<br></a>

<p>There has been a great deal of talk in
this establishment lately about Teir` Dal feeling compassion and
love for Our Brothers and Sisters. I have even personally been
asked whether I would heal a fallen Child of the Father and then
been told that if I did, I did so by the hand of Tunare.
<p>
I have
tried before to explain such matters, and am coming to a
realization as to why you daydwellers need the services of your
"preachers". You obviously need to be told the basics
of true thought at least once a week or you will forget. Allow me
to attempt to explain Our way once more. This time I shall use a
simple example. Think of a cookpot. (Sorry to make you hungry, my
Dark Nephew Gutbludpoopoo. Congratulations on your inevitable
promotion, by the way.) 
<p>
Now a cookpot you use every day, and it
serves you well. Do you love it? If it breaks in half do you not
throw it away without tears? But if the handle breaks, and it is
still useable, do you not mend it? Do you mend it out of
compassion? I am surprised and somewhat sickened, as usual, at
the complete inability of the lesser races to realize that We
actually THINK differently than them. The mortal races, and it
seems even our Bright Cousins, must make such a comical habit of
attributing their own logic and emotions to others. I have even
seen humans do this with their pets. It is pitiful. Now, for
hopefully the last time, I shall state this. 
<p>
The False Mother has
no hand in any action of Teir`Dal, and I suspect that Our Father
Innoruuk has little hand in the dealings of Our Bright Cousins.
It is my purpose in the Will of the Father to insure that the
bodies of my Brethren do not fail in the service, and His Will is
my will. Compassion? Love? Loyalty? Those are concepts for the
weak who do not know the true meaning of unity and purpose. Do
not blaspheme the Name of Our Father by attributing the
weaknesses of Tunare to His Children.

<p>If I am deaf, then you are blind,
fairskin. I have seen much talk of the lack of power of the
Teir\rquote Dal, and I know that such discussion is misinformed.
Remember who we serve, and what He represents. Hate is not rage,
and you would be wise to differentiate the two. Rage is the
unthinking response, the ill-thought action borne of anger. Hate
is patience. Hate is calculation. Hate is Will of Innoruuk which
gives us Unity. With our Hate, we can wait centuries for our
plans to come to fruition. The Hate of the Tier'Dal burns with a
fire the likes of which Solusek himself has rarely seen, and when
that is laid before you - we shall see who will exhibit fear.

Firstborn Priest,<br>
to Gutbludpoopoo, Troll and Ally: <br>
On the nature of Our Father<br></a>

<p>My fine ally, earlier you accepted my
invitation to fight with us, but you said that you did not know
what Innoruuk was. If you will allow me, I will explain it to you
and your large brothers and sisters in simple terms. Innoruuk is
my father. He is a VERY good basher. He isn't small and blue like
me. He is as big as three trolls on top of each other and green
too! You would like Him as much as He likes you. 
<p>
I was by His
side when He bashed that pansy god Mithaniel Marr. The other gods
are bad. They are always saying that Trolls shouldn't bash
things, and that eating people is bad. They will tell you to eat
trees and weeds instead and not bash but just sit around and
talk. Your people were created by Cazic-Thule, and he is bad too.
He says, "Do what I say or I will bash you!" He is not
nice like my Father. 
<p>
My Father Innoruuk likes bashing a lot. He
wants to bash the WHOLE WORLD! He is a good enough basher to do
it too, but He is not selfish. He wants Trolls to have fun too.
He wants you to bash the world with Him. It will be a lot of fun
and all the pointy ears and other little people will get bashed
too. There will be more to eat then you have ever seen. 
<p>
I hope
this helps. I and my Father are happy to welcome such good
bashers. Come to Neriak sometime, we have good food.

<p><a name="humans">Epistle of Aedare,<br>
Human servant of Innoruuk,<br>
to Teir'Dal: On the place of humans<br>
in Innoruuk's Service<br></a>

<p>My lords and ladies, I am but a mere
Human, although there are some who seem to think that Teir'Dal
blood flows through my veins. I wish to speak with you a moment
on matters of great importance to myself and my organization, a
sect in Freeport known as the Church of the Dismal Rage. 
<p>
Through
my contacts, I am often informed of young Teir'Dal, just entering
the Almighty Father's Service, who need aid in preparing to
follow His Path. I spend a great deal of time in the Nektulos
forest and the Neriak Foreign Quarter, in training, defense, or
using my skills to further the Father's Cause. Alas, I often
overhear one great falsehood spoken by some of your blessed kind,
a falsehood that must be stopped. 
<p>
My lords, why would any of you
consider Humans to be your enemies? An enemy is not one who would
do you harm. Is a buzzing gnat your enemy? No, it is merely an
annoyance. An enemy is not simply one who wishes you harm, it is
one who can truly do you harm, one who truly has power over you.
To name us short-lived humans your enemies gives us that power,
power we do not have and will never have! The broken ones, the
High Elves - they are your enemies. We are not. 
<p>
Humans are your
slaves, no more. Do not waste your time destroying that which can
be potentially useful, nor give a power to something which has
none. There are those who could be more than mere slaves; those
who could be true servants, allies even, if you so wished. The
Dismal Rage can be your blades, for most of us WILL lay down our
lives in your service, if you request it. 
<p>
I merely fear that our
lives will be wasted if the younger Teir'Dal are not corrected in
the lie they have been taught. I beg you to spread the word
through your realms that there are humans which are useless, and
humans which are useful. Cull those which are not useful, but do
not waste that which Innoruuk provides you! And, please, do not
waste time calling us your enemies... we are far, far less than
that.

<p><a name="heresy">Epistle of Val'khan,<br>
Grand Inquisitor,<br>
to all Servants of the Church: Heresy and YOU<br></a>

<p>Unto all Servants of the Church of the
Firstborn does Val'khan, Firstborn Knight of the Shadow of
Innoruuk and Grand Inquisitor of the Church of the Firstborn, bid
Greetings.
<p>
My Brethren and others, I am pleased to note that many
of you have recently voiced concerns regarding Heresy. Following
I have outlined what you as a Servant of the Church can do to
combat this insidious disease that threatens to infiltrate Our
strongest bodies of Faith and weaken Our resolve to achieve the
Fulfillment of His Will. 
<p>
First, we must consider the unfortunate
fact that many of our kind have not been properly educated. In
part due to the Church's recent dormancy, many of His Children
have forgotten the Will. It is Our sacred duty to re-educate
them, so that they may know their Purpose and have a chance to
correct their errors. One chance. And while I understand that
this isn't nearly as much FUN as a formal Inquisition, we must
endeavor to remember that it is Innoruuk's Command that the
strictest adherence to the Will MUST be insured. 
<p>
After having
been instructed in the purpose Our Father demands of them, it is
a regrettable fact that some of Our Brothers and Sisters may
still choose to reject His Will. How unfortunate for them. Those
who stand against the Father are damned; whether day dweller or
pure Teir`Dal, they are Hated Others and shall be treated
accordingly. They carry their own doom with them, and their fate
is a foregone conclusion. So you may observe that it is not
necessary, or even possible, to prosecute every Spurned Teir'Dal
as a Heretic. 
<p>
While I am a busy man, I do like to attend to these
things personally. My assistant Inquisitor Drakhan is entirely
competent, but at this point, we just don't have the resources to
waste on those who are already set on a course of
self-destruction. Far more troubling to me are those Children who
have been taught the ways of our Father, but either deliberately
or through ignorance, have rejected His Will and are corrupting
our Church from within. The least of these are those who wish
only to follow those Commandments that are convenient for them.
These individuals will twist the Father's words, interpreting
them in ways that further their own personal goals, not realizing
that through their rationalizations, they have betrayed His Plan
for them. 
<p>
These individuals need correction, gentle at first, and
then...well, that's where I step in, now isn't it? The foulest
and most contemptible heretics are those who pretend to serve His
Will but secretly defy and work against it. These despicable curs
might be lurking anywhere; never assume that any position or
office is inviolate. Heretics can be your family members, your
superior officers, your teachers, and (especially) your lovers.
But do not fear unduly; I can personally guarantee that none of
the Triumvirate are anything but devout and faithful Servants of
the Father. 
<p>
Be ever vigilant, and do not hesitate to report any
suspicious activity of a Servant of the Church to an Inquisitor.
After this, your responsibility in the matter is at an end. Rest
assured that the Inquisitor will determine whether such activity
warrants further investigation and/or my personal attention as
Grand Inquisitor. You may have complete faith in your Brothers
and Sisters of the Third Circle.
<p>
To sum up simply,(especially for any trolls or ogres on our audience):

<p>Spurned: Educate or eliminate. Let Innoruuk sort them out.

<p>Heretics: Report and relax. Let the Church sort them out.

<p>If you have any further questions,
please do not fear to contact me. The rumors concerning the
fellow who disturbed my evening meal two weeks ago have been
greatly exaggerated.

<p>Some may feel it arrogant to quote
oneself. I, however, do not trouble myself with thoughts of
humility and fame, but only with the Will of Our Father. His Will
keeps me ever busy, and therefore I have little time to repeat
myself in different words. It is therefore necessary that I have
collected here quotes from various sermons and letters that prove
to illustrate the Will. Some also contain other knowledge useful
to the Children of Innoruuk. <p>

L'Vanon Firstborn Priest of Innoruuk<br>
Church of the Firstborn, Neriak<br>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<p>We Teir'Dal have dwelt under Nektulos since before the first
human sucked breath. It is Our home, and the sacred Eye of
Innoruuk is upon it always. Our race has practiced the divine art
of Necromancy since Our King and Queen were brought out of
ignorance by Our Father's teachings. This magic permeates the
forest of Nektulos and all within it. Nothing dies in the forest
that does not grow again. Trees root in soil made by the death of
trees that came before. Fungus grows upon rot and dark flowers
spring forth from carcasses. In Nektulos Death is defeated and
Her breath turned aside. No sentient thing that dies there can
rest, but crawls from the dirt to walk again. The smell of
eternal life is so strong that the dead from the surrounding
plains and mountains may sometimes be drawn here as well. Even
many human spirits that perished from the murder, disease, and
hunger that is so common in their city of Freeport make their
slow way to Our forest. These dead are always unsatisfied,
however, and hate the living, Dark Elf or otherwise. It is
therefore good that We &quot;hunt&quot; them, for in this way, We
lay the angry spirit only to raise it again to properly serve the
Will of Innoruuk.

<p>I am amused at how day dwellers attempt
to apply weak mortal morality to Our race. Why do they insist
that We dishonor Our ancestors? Each Teir'Dal has a purpose to
fulfill in the Will of the Father. I am a Priest of Innoruuk and
it is therefore my duty to insure that His children do not stray
from His will, and that their bodies do not falter in His
service. Even the dead of Our race have a duty. We do not die
naturally, and an unnatural demise is no excuse to rest in the
Will of Innoruuk. The dead must serve as they did in life. It is
the purpose of the Necromancers to empower the dead, and lead
them in the Will. Their purpose is of the highest order in our
society and no ill should be spoken of them. It is no dishonor
for Our dead to continue in the Will.

<p>The dead of day dwellers lie rotting in
the dirt. What greater dishonor could there be than that?

<p>~

<p>"Be not mistaken, Enchanter. The
Father does not turn his face from the child, it is the child who
pulls from his Father's embrace. We do not spurn you, you spurn
yourself and your purpose. Even in this disobedience, however,
you serve Innoruuk well. Such is the power of His Will. Do not
look for welcoming faces among Us, but rest knowing that you do
the Will of your Father."

<p>~

<p>Certainly, We have a Queen, and a King,
but the fact that I am born from their union does not make me
&quot;royalty&quot; in the sense that was meant. In a way We are
all born of the Queen, for she is the Eternal Mother. All
Teir'Dal live to serve the Will of the Father, and in that We
each have a purpose which was chosen for Us before Our birth. He
in His wisdom has declared that some purposes are above others,
and are called High Purposes. In that I am a Priest, the highest
purpose, it is my duty to lead all Teir'Dal in the Will of the
Father. In that I am Firstborn, the Father speaks clearly to me,
and His Will is my will and His Thoughts my thoughts. These
things set me apart from others, yes, but it is a pure and
functional division, not a false, self-serving house of cards
like High Elf "royal families" and "nobility".

<p>So, although it is proper that We be set
above all the common mortal races, do not think that We set
Ourselves above each other. Regardless of purpose, all Teir`Dal
are one in the Will of Innoruuk. This is a freedom that no mortal
can understand.

<p>~

<p>We and Our Father are one. We are His
Children, and His Will is Our will. His Goal is Our goal.
Worship, service, and loyalty are but lesser concepts in
comparison. They are only shadows of True Unity.

<p>~

<p>As to Our disputed mortality, I say
this: To be mortal is to live a limited time and then die old.
Elves do not do this, therefore we are not mortal. Nothing but
the Nameless One is immortal in the way that the day dweller
seems to have meant, for I with my own eyes have seen your gods
themselves cease to breathe and walk when confronted with steel
and magic.

<p>~

<p>You pathetic, ignorant child. Never WILL
Marr be felled?? I have stood by my Father as the Dark Army faced
the pathetic forces of the Tyrant, twin brother of the Whore. I
have seen your false god fall and I have seen his light quenched.
The world which we now walk was born of destruction, my misguided
fool, and it shall end as it began.

<p>You day dwellers boast loudly, but it
has been PROVEN who is mightier, and you will learn the truth of
this soon enough. Do not doubt your elders, infant. We have seen
more than you can imagine.

<p>Please disagree with me if you must,
for I know that is your misguided way, but do not disillusion
yourself so. Accept your fate and the fate of your god, for YOU
are far from powerful enough to change it.

<p>~

<p>It is true that many of my Kin are too
young to have come to a perfect understanding of the Will. They
often forget that We turn Our hatred only on Our enemies, and
they turn instead against all that they do not understand. I
remember long before the Day of Darkening, when I myself was only
an Initiate in the Church, a Necromancer accused me of turning
from the Father. He said that he was disgusted that one of Our
kind would turn to the healing arts and spread comfort across the
world. To say that to a Priest of Innoruuk is beyond ignorant. He
has since served the Will in death, instead of life, but this
serves to show exactly how much some of Us have forgotten.

<p>You do have a defense against such
youth, however, and it shall serve you well. Study and learn the
Words of the Father. Learn them well, and come to a deep
understanding of His Will. Then, when you are set upon by those
of Us that have strayed, you can remind them of the Will in the
Father\rquote s own Words, and by this they will see the error of
their ways.

<p>~

<p>Marriage. This is a concept with no
meaning to Teir'Dal. For those who do not understand this,
let us first look at what meaning "marriage" holds
for the day dwellers who practice it.

<p>Day dwellers SAY that marriage concerns
only "love", but even the learned among them know this
to be a ridiculous and sentimental statement.

<p>Firstly, marriage is a legal contract
combining the worldly goods of two parties into one. This
contract prevents disputes over the division of property if death
should befall one or both parties.

<p>Secondly, marriage is a vow spoken
before the gods. Day dwellers are born without purpose, and their
passions are ephemeral. What is dear to them today may be
repugnant tomorrow. However, their society is cruel, and if they
do not raise their own children, or take care of their own
infirm, then their society will leave them to die. They therefore
find it necessary to cling to a relationship that may have grown
unpleasant to them, and this spoken vow may give them the
conviction, albeit false, to continue. 
<p>
It should now be clear
that this "marriage" is a needless thing in Our
society for one, simple reason: We are One. We do not need legal
contracts, for We instead have Unity. If the companionship of one
is no longer pleasant, we do not continue to seek it. Our
offspring are raised in unity, and are taught the ways of
Teir'Dal by all Teir'Dal, as is proper. The crippled are dealt
with according to the Will. Things such as marriage are needed by
the Others to serve as a poor substitute for unity and purpose.
To us such things would be at best folly, and at worst it would
cause Us to forget the Will. Do not practice it, and do not
encourage it in others of Our kind. Thus is the Word of Innoruuk.

<p>~

<p>"Parents": Yet another term with no
meaning to Us. Teir'Dal do not huddle in small family groups,
formed of sentiment and some half-remembered instinct that
prefers common blood. ALL Teir'Dal are Children of Innoruuk, and
we are all Brothers and Sisters under Our Father. It is almost
sad to me to see how far True Unity flies from the grasp of day
dwellers.

<p>~

<p>It is not surprising that the Spurned
are unsure of their path in the Will, for they have chosen to
step from that path, and search for guidance elsewhere. True, the
Scriptures offer little guidance, for they do not speak of the
path of the Spurned, but this is because no path exists.

<p>Some are Spurned because they turn
completely away from Our Father, and decide to follow one of the
lying gods, or worse, swear allegiance only to themselves. The
Father's opinion of these is clear; they should be destroyed, for
they are not only traitors to Our Father and Our Nation, but to
themselves.

<p>Others of the Spurned, however, deserve
a less defined fate. Some of the Spurned devote their lives to
Innoruuk, as is proper, and wonder why they are still shunned.
The reason for this is simple; they are guilty of questioning Our
Father's Will.

<p>Innoruuk has given to Us His Greatest
Gift; the art of Necromancy. It is the one true magic, and it is
all that is needed to accomplish His Will. While His clerics call
directly upon His Power to manifest Itself in Our world,
Necromancy is a precious gift to be born and used by the rest of
His Children. To bind Death Herself to His Will is the purest of
powers.

<p>The Spurned, however, have decided
otherwise. They have turned to other powers such as the power of
the Elements, or the raw power of the universe. Some have even
turned their minds to the low arts of alchemy and enchantment.
The power gained by such studies can be substantial, but it is
still turning to a source other than Our Father for strength, and
this is against His Will.

<p>He is not without an understanding of
the value of such power, however, and those of the Spurned that
turn to Him are allowed to serve, but they walk a difficult path,
for His Eye is always upon them, and should they waver, they
shall join the ranks of the enemies of His Will.

<p>~

<p>Necromancers. True, the Holy Texts speak
little of them, for they are not involved with maintaining the
Faith, but exist only to directly serve the Will. Some might
think that a Warrior serves Our Father most directly on Norrath,
but this is not true. In some ways, the Necromancer\rquote s path
is the purest, for they are the direct conduit of the Breath of
Innoruuk into this accursed world. The purpose of a Necromancer
is simple; insure that Death Herself works within the Will. You
supply the dead to Our Father\rquote s armies, and bring the
power of Death to Our aid. That is a simple purpose, and an
honored one.

<p>~

<p>Why should you not feel pleasure in
fulfilling the purpose for which you were created? Do not the
humans feel pleasure in mating like rabbits and spreading their
corruption over the land? They do, for that is what their
creators wished of them. Our Father has created you for a grand
purpose. It is only natural that you enjoy walking the path He
has set for you. Continue to serve Him, and continue to feel
pleasure in doing so, for this is your reason for existing.

<p>~

<p>Having no clergy is an excuse for
nothing. It is the born duty of Clerics to act as the Mouth of
Innoruuk to His Children, but this does NOT mean that all other
castes should not do the same. All Teir\rquote Dal should spread
the Truth when necessary. Although it is not your sworn
responsibility, it is still your duty as His Child, and more than
that, it is your right. He who says that spreading the Truth of
Innoruuk is &quot;not my job&quot; should have his tongue cut
out, for it does Our Father no good.

<p><a name="society">A Study of the Society, Mating Customs,<br>
and Genealogy of the Teir'Dal Race<br>
Raman Al-Ahntep ,<br>
Church of the Firstborn<br></a>

<p>Many months have I spent among the
enigmatic Teir'Dal. I have had the opportunity to observe their
customs and their social structure at great length, all the while
keeping my scientific interest in them concealed, of course, for
they fanatically resent being studied. What I have found is but a
scratch on the dark surface of their society, and I could easily
make this my life's study, were I allowed to do so. 

<p>Firstly, I
must state the obvious. Teir'Dal society is unlike any other
social structure on Norrath. It is difficult, at times, for a
"day dweller" (as they insist on calling us) to
understand the complexity of their society. I will, however,
attempt to relate what knowledge I have in a clear and concise
manner. 
<p>
An Overview: Teir'Dal do not live in a society filled with
freedom and democracy. Theirs is a culture based strongly on
social class and birthright, and each member of society is
expected to fulfill an assigned function, thereby furthering the
goals of society and Innoruuk. A Dark Elf is assigned a purpose
in Innoruuk's Will at their birth, sometimes even earlier.
<p>
The child follows the path set for him; there is no choice, and
usually no change. Knight is born a Knight, a merchant is born a
merchant. The only exceptions to this seem to result from
failure. A Teir'Dal who fails in the eyes of his kindred and God
may be labeled with an assortment of derogatory titles, and his
social standing is sure to plummet. I shall elaborate more on
this subject later in this text. Although this system of assigned
tasks, or "purposes", would not work for us, Teir'Dal
society runs smoothly and efficiently. This is apparently because
the path chosen for a Dark Elf is in accordance with the
perceived wishes of Innoruuk, and most Teir'Dal do seem
well-suited for their purpose. 
<p>
The Castes: The potential
"purposes" for a new Dark Elf are determined to a great
extent by his or her social caste (pronounced: kayst). ALL
Teir'Dal are descended from their King and Queen, and a Dark
Elf's caste is primarily determined by the number of generations
that they are removed from the Queen. There are technically nine
social divisions, or castes, within Teir'Dal society, but this is
complex, and not easily understood by outsiders. I have listed
the castes in the form of a table, below, in descending order of
prestige. The overall social group is on the farthest left,
divided into the individual castes in the middle, followed by
information about that caste on the right.

<p><strong>Nearborn</strong>: Queen & King

<p>The King and Queen are alone in their
caste. They are considered as truly the Chosen of Innoruuk. All
Teir'Dal are their children, and their power over society is
absolute.

<p>Pureborn: The Pureborn are made up of the
Firstborn, Secondborn, and Thirdborn.

<p>Although the Teir'Dal do not have a
&quot;nobility&quot; such as we have, the caste system does
provide a similar structure, and the Pureborn are the Teir'Dal
version of &quot;high nobility&quot;. They are highly revered by
all Teir'Dal, as they are thought to have clear communication
with Innoruuk, with Firstborn being in almost constant direct
contact with Him. I do not know how true this is, but most
Pureborn become great leaders of society, and many are called to
the clergy.

<p>Highborn: The Highborn are the rough
equivalent of daydwelling &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;, and are
usually leaders of their brother Teir' Dal. They commonly hold
positions in society such as Generals and Ambassadors.

<p><strong>Trueborn</strong>

<p>Although the Trueborn technically
consists of three castes just like the Nearborn and Farborn, it
is considered arrogant and presumptuous for the common people to
keep track of these divisions. Far more Teir'Dal are Trueborn
than any other caste. They are the backbone of the Teir'Dal
nation, serving as warriors, performing skilled labor, training
and managing slaves, etc.

<p><strong>Farborn</strong>

<p>Lowborn: The offspring of the
Disobedient, Lowborn are relegated to menial tasks within the
culture and live their lives serving. The tasks that they perform
are those considered forbidden to other Teir'Dal, such as the
harvesting of growing things and acting as common merchants. With
this as their fate, the ambitious among them sometimes embrace
the forbidden teachings of the Spurned.

<p>Illborn: The Teir'Dal are very concerned
with what they feel are advantageous matings. The offspring of
inappropriately matched parents are called &quot;Illborn&quot;.
Matings that would result in Illborn children are STRONGLY
discouraged, and one or both parents are often deemed
&quot;Disobedient&quot; for such behavior. The union is
considered to be a defiance of the Will of Innoruuk, and the
resulting child is treated little better than a slave. Illborn
are not allowed to mate further, even with each other.

<p>Darkborn: Certainly the strangest of all
castes, the Darkborn are highly revered throughout their
extremely short lives, even though they are technically Lowborn.
On occasion, a girl is chosen for the purpose of bearing a gift
to Innoruuk, and she is cloistered and ritually cared for. The
King of the Teir'Dal mates with her, and the resulting child is
given as a blood sacrifice to Innoruuk. Few Teir'Dal, let alone
outsiders, have ever witnessed the care taken of the girl before
and during her pregnancy, so I cannot elaborate further on those
rituals. EVERY Darkborn child has been sacrificed in a public
ceremony, and such an occurrence is celebrated as a great
festival by the Teir'Dal.

<p><strong>Outcasts </strong>: When a
Teir'Dal fails his people or God, he becomes a social outcast,
and his caste seems to matter no longer. Once an individual is
deemed an outcast of any sort, his lineage is apparently no
longer of importance. I have personally observed four categories
of outcasts, and shall list them here.

<p><strong>The Disobedient</strong>: These
are individuals who have failed society in some way. They are
usually tolerated within society, but are considered second class
citizens and treated as are the Lowborn. The easiest way to be
labeled "Disobedient" seems to be by denying Innoruuk.
All who choose to be agnostic, or follow another God, are deemed
Disobedient. 
<p>
Also, those who deny their assigned purpose in
society, or disobey their superiors, are destined for a life
among the Disobedient. I have also met individuals who fell from
grace solely because of repeated or exceptional failure in their
duties. The Teir'Dal are even less forgiving of such things than
are we. To be deemed Disobedient is a lifetime sentence.

<p><strong>The Spurned</strong>: A confusing
distinction, the Teir'Dal seem to consider any magical powers not
derived directly from the power of Innoruuk to be
"evil". This includes those arts which are so
acceptable to other races, such as calling upon the forces of the
elements, and of manipulating the minds of others. Necromancy is
the only art truly accepted by them. (A fact that is, at least,
convenient for this author.) 
<p>
The Spurned band together, and have
formed a complex sub-culture of their own. Although constantly at
odds with the Church, the Spurned are found in all levels of
society and often prosper despite their social standing. Some,
who have sworn to rededicate their lives to Innoruuk, bring
diverse powers to the service of their God and attain positions
of authority within society. They are, however, always looked
upon with untrusting eyes by the truly devout.

<p><strong>The Excommunicated </strong>: On
occasion the authorities of the Church find reason to
excommunicate an individual. From that point on, no faithful
Teir'Dal will speak to, deal with, touch, or assist the
individual. It is as if the Excommunicant does not even exist. I
have heard that it is sometimes possible for such a person to
regain favor with the Church, and have this status removed, but I
have not personally witnessed such an occurrence.

<p><strong>The Fallen</strong>: Truly the
worst fate that can befall a Dark Elf. If a Teir'Dal is foolish
enough to openly deny his people, and turn against them and
Innoruuk, he is branded as one of the Fallen. The Fallen are
simply treated in the same manner as any day dwelling enemy of
the Teir'Dal. That is to say, a Dark Elf will go to great lengths
to kill a Fallen on sight. There is no repeal for such
individuals.

<p>Mating: This is a notoriously difficult
subject for outsiders to understand, yet I have done my best, and
shall record here what I have found. At first glance, Teir'Dal
society seems full of debauchery and promiscuity. When one delves
further, however, one comes to understand that they merely act
with more sexual freedom than do other races, and put less
emphasis on permanent relationships. As far as I can discern,
Teir'Dal do not marry as day dwellers do. 
<p>
I have observed some
couples who seem bound together in ceremony at the whim of
Innoruuk, and for purposes of "His" own, but these
almost never seem consensual, and often seem to be for some
purpose other than procreation. Teir'Dal usually come together
only on a relatively temporary basis to mate and produce
offspring. Family life, therefore, is not nearly as defined as it
is in our society. It is also not uncommon to encounter pairings
which we would consider incestuous. This, of course, is to be
expected in a race descended entirely from two people. Oddly,
Teir'Dal do not seem to suffer often from the ill-effects usually
associated with such practice. However, they do seem very
concerned with choosing an appropriate mate, and any children
born even slightly flawed are killed at birth.

<p>Family: There is a Teir'Dal saying that
states, &quot;Families are for the weak.&quot; Their reason for
this is as follows: They believe that families are merely a
grouping of individuals for the purpose of defending themselves
against the rest of their own society. Families are made up of
blood relatives, because those bear the closest resemblance to
the other members, and are therefore closer to &quot;us&quot;
than &quot;them&quot;. They believe that in a truly unified
society, in which all members work toward a common goal, a family
is unnecessary. While this is a difficult doctrine to grasp, I do
tend to see the logic in it. The Teir'Dal do seem to be more
unified as a culture than any other race that I have seen. While
we constantly war with our brethren in the High City, and the
Humans are scattered into a thousand factions, the Teir'Dal work
as a well-oiled machine, coming ever closer to their goal of
destroying the world. But I digress.

<p>The Rearing of Children: Dark Elven
children are raised in a "cr'eche" system. All
children in the same age group are grouped together, and each
group is communally raised by society as a whole. It is difficult
to determine who is actually assigned to care for the children,
for they seem to receive guidance from any passerby. Although
this seems to a casual observer as nothing more than neglect,
Dark Elf children seldom want for attention, and seem to grow to
adolescence gaining an innate understanding of all facets of
their complex society.
<p>
Again, although difficult for us to relate
to, the system does seem to function. This system does have one
interesting effect on the children. Two children of the same age
usually form a stronger &quot;familial&quot; bond than they do
with real siblings of a different age group. A blood brother and
sister may barely know each other, if their ages differ greatly.
It is to be noted, however, children still bear the surname of
their birth mother, and their social class is entirely determined
by that of their parents.

<p>Surnames: As I have previously noted,
Teir'Dal society is one in which couples are seldom monogamous,
and sexual behavior borders on promiscuity. This often makes
accurate identification of a child's father difficult or
impossible. Therefore, although Teir' Dal society is not a
matriarchy, the inheritance of surnames and property descends
through the mother. Children born of the same mother all share
the same surname, even if they are sired by different men. Since
there is no "marriage" as we know it, a person is never
required to adopt the surname of a mate. 
<p>
The only exceptions to
these rules come with the King and Queen, the Firstborn, and
their children. The King and Queen share the surname Thex, which
was given to them by Tunare at their creation; a name also shared
by the rulers of the Feir'Dal. Their children, the
Firstborn, take the surname Thex, but add a prefix denoting the
"age" in which they were born. These "ages"
are obviously calendar divisions, but seem to vary in length, and
each is assigned a prefix by the Queen on its first night. 
<p>
Thus
one knows that two Firstborn both bearing the name G'thex are
nearly brothers as we think of them, and yet their full sister
named N'thex was born a thousand years earlier. This is an
important distinction for a race that lives for centuries, and
for a Teir'Dal, age defines family more than blood. 
<p>
The offspring
of a Firstborn mother does not keep the mother's surname. The
males are given a surname by their father, often named after an
historic figure. The females are granted an appropriate new
surname by their mother, and this name will then be passed down
to all of her descendants, creating a new line. These surnames
vary greatly, and are often chosen for their meaning or
significance. 
<p>
Conclusion: Although I have but recorded here only
the most basic information, it can still be seen how engaging and
worthwhile this field of study is. The Teir'Dal live in a
society which is harsh, demanding, efficient, and above all,
intriguing. I urge the Council to approve funding and allow me to
return to Neriak for further research. It would be best to
understand this subject fully, for the Teir'Dal are not only
fascinating, but also potentially dangerous.<p>
