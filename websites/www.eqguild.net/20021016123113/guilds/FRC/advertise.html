           <p>As alot of people know, its alot of work getting a Server board up and running.  One of the hardest things  is getting the word out that the board is even up.    We have done everything that we could think of.   Now all we ask is your help, to let others know.  The best way to get this board going is just by word of mouth, linking on your webpage..or what ever.  Just as long as it doesn't spam other boards hehe :)</p>
           <p>We are not a company, we are players just like you.  We don't have awards to give out or anything like that.  If we did I am sure that we would.</p>
           <p>All I can do now is ask for your help :)  Please help us keep Fennin Ro Chronicles up and running, and lets make it the Best Server Board out there!</p>
           <p>Thankyou all!  And have fun Playing Everquest!<br>
