        Hail and well met. <br> <br>I want to stop in and say hi to several that do not know me. <br>I am Sandralay and I have come to your services. &nbsp;As of last night I accepted an invitation from Serenya to join your ranks as a little pup. &nbsp;(Cute one too) <br>I follow nature where it takes me (druid) and seek to help the weary and distressed. &nbsp;Many seasons have passed through my limbs thus may you call on my services as would of yours. <br> <br>*bows low* <br> <br>Sandralay

        Sandy sandy sandy sandy!!  So glad to have you as a part of the Den!! <br> <br>For those of you who haven't met Sandralay yet, she's one of my long time friends in Norrath and has always lent a helpful hand or an ear when needed.   <br> <br>And WOOT  she's one of us now :D  *does the happy dance*   <br> <br>(I know it's hard to keep new members separate from alts, so just to clarify, Sandralay is a new member.  Please make sure to invite her along until she feels comfortable just tagging along because she knows she can ;) ) <br> <br>(Edited by Lilla at 2:22 pm on June 1, 2001)
