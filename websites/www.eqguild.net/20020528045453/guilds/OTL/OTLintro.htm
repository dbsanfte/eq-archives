    <p>Welcome and thank you for visiting the Order of Truth and Lore!</p>
    <p align="left">The Order of Truth and Lore is a role playing and language guild. 
      Our members are interested in collecting as many languages as possible. We 
      are also a guild open only to &#8220;good&#8221; races and classes. This excludes 
      all Necromancers and Shadow Knights, as well as Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves 
      and Iksars. While these races may not necessarily be evil in the eyes of some, 
      they are commonly tainted, as we believe, by evil ways. </p>
    <p align="left">We encourage role playing, and fair play. Members are encouraged 
      to help newbies as well as others in need. Most of all, members are encouraged 
      to have fun.</p>
    <p align="left">Please feel free contact us by leaving a message on the board, 
      or email us at <a href="mailto:iddin@eqguild.net">Iddin@eqguild.net</a> or 
      <a href="mailto:elnrik@eqguild.net">Elnrik@eqguild.net</a> </p>
