     [B]News[/B]
        11-25-02
      The Mighty Jesters Of Ayone Ro is founded! I'm new to html so I will need someone to help me update the site. If you can e-mail me at: mightyjeterso@yahoo.com. If you want to join e-mail the character survey answers to the e-mail address above.

     [B]History[/B]
   This clan/guild was started on November 25, 2002 becuase I  looked at the other clan/guilds out there and didn't find one to my likings. Which is having fun and helping people. I appreciated the help more experienced players gave me. I also enjoy helping other people and having fun doing so as my experience with diablo made me realize. Thus the Mighty Jesters of Ayone Ro was founded.
