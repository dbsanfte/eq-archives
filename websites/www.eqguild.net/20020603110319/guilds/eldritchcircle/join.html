We are largely formed from members of the Morell Thule guild Guardians of Truth who moved to Antonius Bayle in the server split. We have a few low level characters but the bulk of our membership is around mid 20s to mid 40s in level. We recruit prospective new members only through recommendation - i.e. only people we have got to know are invited into our guild. If you wish to join, you should group with some of us and get to know us first. An existing member must act as your sponsor and recommend you to an officer of the guild. If you are interested in joining, but don't yet know any of us, please check our <a href="roster.html" target="_self">guild roster</a> and contact an officer in-game - we will try our best to invite you along to something.<br>
