        Sometimes we all need a break...The game can get all too real and no longer is that place we go to for a break from reality. &nbsp;It starts emulating all those stresses of the real world that we're trying to escape from. <br> <br>In my experience, a break helps a lot. &nbsp;It's easier to reprioritize and realize what we miss about the game and what was taking the fun out of it. <br> <br>I know you may need a break, Manglore and Qalynea, but please know that we miss you and are thinking about you...and wishing you well...and can't wait to see you back in EQ when the time is right for you. <br> <br>
