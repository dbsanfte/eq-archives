        Greetings to the Wolf Den, <br>I had the pleasure of meeting Lilla this last to me evening past, but to her twas this morning.  I really enjoyed chatting with Lilla and would like to have an opportunity to chat with more of you from this guild.  I have reviewed the charter and like what I see. <br>now OOC this is not my first char nor my primary char, however MT suffers some major crashes, there for I am looking for a more stable or an alternate place to spend the time I pay for.  As for the age limit I more than qualify, a lady never tells her age unless she must.  This char is a flirt, and I am an avide RPer and wish to play as such, perhaps this would bother some, I truely hope not for tis all in fun.  Here's to hoping that I shall meet more druids such as my self. <br> <br>Kristianie druid of the fourth circle of growth

        Nice to see new faces :) <br> <br>Glad to see you are a RPer too, not enough of us about these days, it always helps to make the game more fun. Are you European? It would be good to have more guild members on during the times I play, as unfortunatley most members get on when I am about to sleep. <br> <br>Good luck and enjoy <br> <br>:)

        Hello Manglore, <br> &nbsp;Tell your father to look up Caleisto Thule sometime (48th lvl shamaness)...she is still my primary char...being my first one, even with the flaws in creating her.

        Ohhh...I'm SO SLOW to respond! &nbsp;*spanks herself and enjoys it* ;) &nbsp;So glad to see you made it to our boards, Kristianie. &nbsp;I've looked for you online but have missed you if you've been on the Rathe the past couple of days :) <br> <br>I had a great time getting to know you a little and acting like a semi-god outside of CB (always good for the ego) &nbsp;Although a lot of our guildmembers don't roleplay, we have no malice towards those that do. &nbsp;I love to watch others roleplay but I tend to just be me wherever I am...(although my rogue Tess likes to pretend she's evil) <br> <br>hehe...again, so glad you made it here! <br> <br>Hope to see you online soon :D
