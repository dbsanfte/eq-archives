Made Forum (message board) pop up in a seperate window ... trying to find a way to keep people logged into message board so they dont need to log in each time (have been getting some complaints about that) Im not exactly sure why EZBoard wont keep you logged in while using frames ... if anyone knows lemme know , and hopefully this will work for now

          Will be updating jewelry skill page soon.
Will be easier to find what you want.  Remember this
is not a cheap skill, so any donations to it at appreciated.
If you have a skill let me know what you can make.
If I don't get any info then I'm just going to link
them to another sight.  Got rid of Skills list and linked SKILLS to Eqtraders.com.  I believe this is the best trade skills site ever.  At least best one I have come across so far.  As you can see I also changed the path to get here
easier.  Thanks for the advise, sorry can't think of your
name right now :(.  Make sure you are signed up on Message
board and at Guildmagic.com.
