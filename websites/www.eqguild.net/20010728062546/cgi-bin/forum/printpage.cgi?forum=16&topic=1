        1) in the flash intro, "Sacrifice" is misspelled <br>2) I'd suggest putting a "skip intro" link on the entry page, as repeat visitors may not want to watch the movie every time they come back. (for example I wanted to skip it just now because the music totally overrode the text-to-speech that was reading me my email while I surfed) <br> <br>3) if you have a graphic you'd like to use in the forum, please give me the url... I just picked that corner thing because it was the only thing I could find :)
