<center>Role-Playing</center><br>
Always remain in character (IC). Get involved with the guild. If you have something to say out of character then us the /ooc channel, otherwise always speak in character in shouts and says.<br>
<center>Proper Language</center><br>
Swearing, real life racial slurs and off color jokes will not be tolerated. Insulting persons for Role Playing uses is acceptable but do not direct any of them at the player, only his character.<br> 
<center>Use of /anonymous</center><br>
The command /anonymous should only be used in cases of extreme harassment, undercover work, and enchanter illusion spells. This command will remove your guild tag. Always remain /roleplay. (dropping the guild tag for any reason without permission is grounds for immediate removal from the guild)<br> 
<br><center>Guild Interaction</center><br>
<center>Treat all Members with Respect</center><br>
All the members of this guild are brothers and sisters in arms. Treat each other with respect and friendship.<br> 
<br><center>Follow the Chain of Command</center><br>
The officers are not unjust in their dealings and will not show favoritism les they lose all rank and privileges. However, you will be required to follow their instructions.<br> 
<br><center>Use of Trade skills</center><br>
For fellow guild members you can charge a fair price for your services. No one is expected to pay cost for products, but neither should they have to pay what one not in the guild would be charged. If you want to sell your services at cost for guild members that is your right. Members should never expect this kind of action or assume that because they bought the components that a labor charge will not be applied.<br> 
<br><center>Use of /guildsay</center><br>
The guild channel is a way for all members to stay in constant contact no matter what zone they are in. Spying Information about our enemies and their strengths and weaknesses shall be collected only by in game means. No members shall be allowed to create 'spy' characters of opposite races. If it is found out that you are either running a spy or are a spy for one of the other teams you will be immediately removed from the guild and put on our Hated Enemy list.<br> 
<br><center>Killing Other Players</center><br>
We are evil, feel free to back stab, root and overly bash those of opposite teams and do not show them any honor in battle. Run from battles you cannot win, but do not leave your brother behind to die. This is one of the worst offenses you can commit against the guild.<br> 
<br><center>Non-Guild Interaction</center><br>
<br><center>Do Not Camp Newbie Respawn Points</center><br><br>
This activity should be viewed as cowardice. The slaying of the helpless and defenseless does very little to spread the darkness. We must destroy the strongest of the lights forces, not their underlings.<br> 
<br><center>Dealings with the Dark Races</center><br><br>
If another character is not part of our guild, but is part of our team then treat him with the honor do his race. We do not want to promote dissention among our peoples. That goes against our guild charter.<br> 
<br><center>Dealings with Non-Dark Races</center><br><br>
DO NOT group with members not of the Dark Race Team. DO NOT assist them unless you have a good role-playing reason. Slavery may be a case where grouping and dealing with them would be considered appropriate. Of course, if you wish to sell them a tattered cap for 4p then by all means gouge the prices. DO NOT sell any really good items to those not of the Dark Team that may later be used against us.<br>
<br><center>Guild Wars</center><br><br>
We shall make several enemies as we spread the darkness on Norrath. Remember that your character hates the other guild's characters, not their players. Only unanimous vote of all officers can declare official guild wars. Guild Officers may need to meet with opposing guild officers from time to time to discuss mutual items such as where to hold battles and things of this nature.<br>
<br><center>Languages Forbidden to Teach</center><br><br>
Dark Speech, Troll, Ogre, Tier`Dal, and Iksar must never be shared with those not of the Dark Team. This is considered a major offense against the guild and against your entire team and race. However, take all opportunities those weak minded fools offer to learn their languages. DO NOT exchange one of our languages for one of theirs.<br>
<br><center>PvP Rules of Conduct</center><br><br>
You will never ever pull the plug while Zoning. If caught doing this. It will lead to a warning next action will be dismissal from the guild.<br> 
<br>You will always show honor to your victim. By not attacking while looting or running out of the zone after looting.<br><br> You will leave the Zone after getting your body if a PKer has killed you. You will then have to wait at least 30 mins to return to that zone to Pk.<br><br> It’s this that allows them to feel victory in battle. It’s a form of respect. And yes not all PKers deserver respect but we will still show that we are honorable.<br> 
<br>Loot and Scoot<br><br>
In order to promote good sportsmanship and honorable conduct, The Order of the Black Thorns will follow a self-motivated L&S policy. 
L&S will entail the following:<br> 
#1 After you are defeated in PvP (defined as killing blow done by an enemy player), you will not engage in combat in that same zone for a period of 30 real time minutes.<br> 
#2 after being defeated in PvP, you will return to the zone where your body lays, loot it, and leave the zone immediately.<br> 
Some amplification: It doesn't matter what other guilds do, we will follow only this policy. So if you're grouped with a guild that refuses to L&S, and you die in PvP combat, you will follow our policy, not theirs.<br> 
There will be cases where the enemy is not following any sort of PvP policy and making PvP miserable. In these cases, contact an officer. The officer will contact the senior member of the enemy guild online and try to straighten out the matter. If the enemy guild has no intentions of following L&S (or other bad examples of poor sportsmanship) the Officer will make a judgment call of how to continue.<br> 
<br><center>Punishment</center><br>
Minor Offenses<br>
<br>Each case will be different. Hopefully there will never be a need of punishment. Most minor offense shall be dealt with in a Role-Playing fashion that may include such things as being stripped of all awards and rank or being outcast from guild activities for one week.<br> 
<br>Major Offenses<br>
<br>Everyone gets one warning. After that your character shall be removed from the guild. None of the guild officers want to waste their game time babysitting. Several repeats of a minor offense shall be considered a major offense.<br> 
</text><br><br><br><br><br>
<center>Recruting</center><br><br>
All members of the Order of the Black Thorns are technically recruters. Find those that play well and that you enjoy grouping with and talk to them about the guild, send them to the web site to read the rules.<br>
To join the guild one needs recomendations from active guild members. It takes the recomendation of one officer or two members to be considered for guild membership.<br>
No one can recrute someone of a higher lvl then them, we may be low lvl now but we are growing and will get the high level folks eventually.
