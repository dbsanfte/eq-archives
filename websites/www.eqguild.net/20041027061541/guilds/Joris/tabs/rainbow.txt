The lovers,    the   dreamers,    and   me  [repeat intro]
 
Who said that every wish would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that, and someone believed it
And look what it's done so far
 
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see?
 
| Am7              | D7               | Bm7              | E7               |
  Some - day  we'll  find   it,    the  rain - bow  con -  nection
 
| Am7              | D7sus        D7  | G                | D/F#             |
The lovers,    the   dreamers,    and   me,                all     of  us
 
| Em               | G/D              | C                | G/B              |

Have you been half asleep, and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same
 
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
 
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
