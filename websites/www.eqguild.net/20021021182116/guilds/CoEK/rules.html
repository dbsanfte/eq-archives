If you decide our Council is not right for you, please tell an officer before you leave. If you don't, you will not be allowed to return.
<br><br>
NO begging from our Knights or other players. You can ask twice, nicely, in guild chat. If we can help, we will.
<br><br>
NO stealing at all. Our Knights are to be trusted. We have a no-tolerance policy, if you are caught stealing you WILL be exiled.
<br><br>
Always wear your guildtag, use Roleplay if you wish to have your stats hidden, but never Anonymous. You will get 2 warnings, the third time you will lose the priviledge of wearing it.
<br><br>
No heavy cussing in guildchat. Respect for each other is the very heart of our guild.
<br><br>
Always be courteous to your fellow Knights. Say hello and goodbye, it doesn't take much and means more than you know.
<br><br>
