 </font><font color="#FFFFFF">I
 would like to thank everyone in the guild for getting us off to such a
 great start! Those of you who are still with us, thanks for staying. However,
 i feel that this guild is going nowhere, and it would be unfair for me
 to ask you all to stay in it, when you could all be joining guilds that
 are doing well. To that end, I have decided to delete the guild. There
 are rarely more than 1 or 2 people on, and its invarialbly the same 2.&nbsp;
 Unfortunately, on such an old server, there is just no desire from the
 average player to grow a guild, they would simply rather join one that's
 already esablished. Good Luck in all you future endeavors, and I hope to
 see you all in game!</font></font>
