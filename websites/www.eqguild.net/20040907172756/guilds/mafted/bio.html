	<i><b>The Biography Of Download</b></i></font>

		&nbsp; &nbsp; It all started when cEvin Key, Dwayne Goettel (then 2 out of the 3 members of the now dormant Skinny Puppy)
		 Mark Spybey (of Zoviet France), Ryan Moore (of the Twilight Circus Dub Sound System), Dave Ogilvie (long time Puppy producer who
		 has also worked with NIN), Anthony Valcic, Genesis P. Orridge (of the legendary Throbbing Gristle project) and Ken Marshall (who also worked with Puppy right from the beginning)
		 started messing around - jamming at Subconscious Studios with improvisation as their main musical source.  
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; The first real "track" created doesn't appear on a download album.  Rather, it's on Skinny Puppy's Last Rights - entitled "download".  It's obviously a departure from
		the "normal" Puppy tracks - with almost randomly looped samples and distorted synth frequencies.

		&nbsp; &nbsp; After American Recordings dropped Skinny Puppy - the band was obviously no more.  Key and Goettel both were already slightly involved with making download and Ogre (Puppy's vocalist)
		didn't want to be involved.
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, <b>Furnace</b> was recorded.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; On the lineup was cEvin Key, Dwayne Goettel, Mark Spybey, Anthony Valcic and Phil(th).  This album, in my opinion, is definitely their most harsh and abrasive material so far.  It's hard to listen 
		to the whole thing straight because of it's relentlessness.   
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Microscopic</b> was released as a single off of Furnace (with mixes by download, one by Newt and one by Biosphere).

		&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Charlie's Family</b> is a soundtrack for a movie (of the same name) that was never released.  The first version of the cd was limited to 2,000 copies.  It was then re-released in an orangy color (rather than the blue - original color).
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; This is probably the weirdest music that download has done - and that maybe anyone has done. Some songs seem to have absolutely no direction, rhythym, or even melody.  Yet, some songs (like catblower, tweeterblower, and yes) do have definite Key-like rhythym and an occasional melody.

		&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>The Eyes Of Stanley Pain</b> is probably the most "acceptable" download release.  The songs vary slightly with their style and abrasiveness.
		<br>
		<br>
		The ninth track ("Outafter") was supposed to originally be a Skinny Puppy song - but, according to Key, Ogre thought it was too "techno-ie" for the band and it went unreleased - until now.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; It was also supposed to be the theme song to The Crow, but, for some reason, it didn't make the deadline for the soundtrack.  Brandon Lee liked it but was killed, accidentally, in the shooting of the film (I'm sure you've all heard about this).
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, the song is dedicated to Lee, as stated in E. of S. Pain's cd cover.
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, Dwayne died of a heroin overdose in mid 95', confirming Puppy's demise and the loss of a very talented musician.
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Sidewinder</b> was released as a single off of E. of S. Pain (with mixes by download and one by Haujobb).

		&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>III</b> is an obvious departure from their normal style. With Spybey's departure (due to creative differences and Spybey's "<a href="http://www.dvoa.com/" target="_top">Dead Voices On Air</a>" project), Key, Philth, and Marshall
		continued on and recorded - with an almost improvisational effort - III.  The cover of this album is perfect with how the music goes.  This album is a mesh of beautiful analog synths and sequencers with "quarky" rhythms.  One minute everything will be at harmony
		and the next your speakers will be exploding.

		<td>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Effector</b>, download's latest, is also quite a departure from the other releases.  Once again, download's music has managed to evolve in to a sound that stands out above other electronic music.  This album is full of harsh, mind-bending, experimental beats that somehow mesh together.  The whole cd, as with the other albums, is great to listen to as a whole, each song being the chapter of a book.  Effector is quite a unique piece of art - its style 
		is very intriguing.
