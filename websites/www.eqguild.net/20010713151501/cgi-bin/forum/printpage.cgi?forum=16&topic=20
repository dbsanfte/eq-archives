        The little swords coming out is cool, and so are the rotations, but i think both is a little overkill. <br> <br>Find a gothic, old english font for the guild name across the top. &nbsp;getting rid of the fram bar across the top woul &nbsp;improve the look. <br> <br>Maybe a nice pattern or background image would work. <br> <br>If you want a sweet site to check out go look at <a href="http://www.clanimpact.com" target="_blank">http://www.clanimpact.com</a> &nbsp;or www.coinfist.com

        Dude drops the animations that initial flash throws it off, would be cool if they slided in from both sides at same time. <br> <br>Make the upper regions a little smaller and put some gothic font for the name, a nice intricate background would be seet. <br> <br>See you cleaned up the knight picture, looks good. <br> <br>Think you could change the lame ass mortal combat music, use that heavy fat asss intro to that song on the same album with the crunching guitars, that song kicks ass &nbsp;least until the dude sings, he sucks ballz big time <br> <br>You are missing a bunch of people from the guild roster &nbsp;take mastenn and reon's no show ass off as well.
