            <h3>Getting to the gathering point:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>If you camped out at the gathering point (you though ahead and 
                went there before logging out),<br>
                then you can login 5 minutes before raid start time.</li>
              <li>If you are <strong>not camped at the gathering point</strong> 
                you must log in early enough to give you enough time to get there.<br>
              </li>
              <li>When you log on you join the raid chat channel and tell everyone 
                hello. </li>
              <li>Send a <strong>/Tell</strong> to the &quot;group maker&quot; 
                of your class and level.</li>
              <li>If you have not already...<strong>Get your resist gear from 
                bank.</strong></li>
              <li>Make your way to the gathering point. Raid porters <strong>MAY</strong> 
                be collecting people, but If Not get a ride from (in order) a 
                local porter, a /port channel person, a guild porter (not already 
                busy), and if all these fail a raid porter.</li>
              <li>You may need to go through dangerous zones to even arrive at 
                the gathering point. You should plan this out <em>before</em> 
                the day of the raid to know how to get there and what you will 
                need along the way (invisibility, invis undead, succor/evak, levitate, 
                etc.)</li>
              <li>Once you actually arrive at the gathering point you notify the 
                raid leader and group maker again that you have arrived (class 
                and level).</li>
              <li>Turn off anon and roleplay.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Making Groups:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Turn off anon and roleplay.</li>
              <li>Type /LFG on.</li>
              <li>Groups are assigned and group leaders invite members.</li>
              <li>Group leaders inform the chat channel when all members they 
                are supposed to invite have joined.</li>
              <li>Now is a good time to adjust your visual settings to <strong>reduce 
                Lag</strong>. Some of the things to try are...Turn off character 
                overhead names, reduce &quot;particle density&quot;, turn off 
                sky graphics, turn off visual spell graphics. Turn one off at 
                a time and see how it affects your responsiveness.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Initial buffing:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Based on the types of mobs that will be encountered along the 
                way to the primary mob buffs will be applied.</li>
              <li>There are 3 kinds of buffs that may be applied. Individual, 
                Entire Group, and Mass Group.</li>
              <li>Mass group buffs should be applied first. 
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>The buffer will notify the raid channel that the buffing 
                    will occur.</li>
                  <li>Everyone should gather in a &quot;somewhat&quot; tight circle 
                    around the buffer.</li>
                  <li>The buffer they will repeat the raid notification.</li>
                  <li>The mass group buff is cast.</li>
                  <li><strong>The mass buff will not be repeated</strong>. If 
                    you missed out that is unfortunate. It usually cannot be repeated 
                    due to mana cost.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Next come group buffs. <strong>Do not ask for group buffs.</strong> 
                Group leaders do the asking.</li>
              <li>Finally come the individual buffs. Different classes require 
                different things. Casters don't need haste, and warriors don't 
                need clarity.It is up to you to know...A. What buffs you already 
                have on you, and B. What additional buffs you need.</li>
              <li>To get a buff you <strong>Do Not Ask in raid channel, Only ask 
                by TELLS!!</strong>. You find out which members present cast the 
                buff you think you need and give them a direct tell for that buff.</li>
              <li>First try to choose people with equipment that can cast the 
                spell you need (haste from enchanter epic for example). Lower 
                mana costs.</li>
              <li>The easiest way to give a direct tell is to type <span class="chat">/target 
                &lt;partial name of person&gt;</span> followed by <span class="chat">/tt 
                &lt;your request&gt;</span>. Some characters names can be quite 
                long and easy to mistype.</li>
              <li>Be simple, concise and polite. {eg. Cleric requests [ Clarity 
                ] when mana permits =) }.</li>
              <li>Only ask once per 3 minutes...other people are asking that person 
                also. </li>
              <li>You usually don't need to specify what subclass of buff you 
                require. Clarity = Clarity, Clarity II, Gift of Pure Thought, 
                or Koadic. The buffer will give you the best they have or depending 
                on their mana at the time the most you need.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>The Break-in:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>This is very dependant on the zone being broken.</li>
              <li>Listen to the raid channel and you will be instructed what to 
                do and when.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Getting to the Target:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>This is a repetitive process with occasional highlights of terror.</li>
              <li>The entire raid moves to a new pulling point.</li>
              <li>The puller (in order of preferrence a monk, shadowknight, high 
                level player) goes deeper into the zone.</li>
              <li>The puller does their best to bring back as few mobs as possible. 
                Groups of mobs are &quot;split&quot; and the puller returns.</li>
              <li>Monks or Shadowknights will feign death (FD) to lose agro and 
                the main assist tank will target the mob and generally piss it 
                off.</li>
              <li>Crowd control players will manage any 2nd, 3rd, etc. mobs. <strong>Do 
                not attack these mobs</strong>. Chanters or bards mezmerize, if 
                none of these then rooters root, if none of these or if mob not 
                stopable second assist engages.</li>
              <li>Mob is killed.</li>
              <li>Any additional mobs are killed one at a time as chosen and announced 
                by MA, until mob crowd is done.</li>
              <li>Raid leader decides if more pulls to current spot, or raid group 
                moves farther in.</li>
              <li>Process repeats until pull area before main target is reached.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Final buffing:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Put on <strong>resist gear</strong> for final target.</li>
              <li>Depending on the target this will either be one of two types 
                of buffing. </li>
              <li>Touch up or specific buffing for any buffs that might have fallen 
                recently or are required for final target. Example: resists. </li>
              <li>Buffing line. 
                <ol>
                  <li>If there is to be a buffing line then first everyone removes 
                    ALL their buffs.</li>
                  <li>No self buffs are applied.</li>
                  <li>Everyone (who is not performing buffs) lines up in a queue.</li>
                  <li>The raid leaders and buffers know what order and what buffs 
                    to apply for this final target. (order matters, some mobs 
                    remove buffs)</li>
                  <li>You may be called on to assist in the buffing, or to help 
                    those doing the buffing. <br>
                    (Example: healing shamans when they use cannibalize to get 
                    more mana for buffs).</li>
                  <li>As soon as you reach the end of the buffing line you will 
                    either be asked to 
                    <ol>
                      <li> /camp and then join a chat channel outside of the EQ 
                        game</li>
                      <li>or wait for further instructions. </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>This depends on how long the raid leaders figure the buffing 
                    + battle with target will take, and whether any buffs might 
                    time out.</li>
                  <li><strong>If you /camped</strong> then group leaders will 
                    need to reform groups.</li>
                  <li>You will need to rejoin the raid chat channel.</li>
                </ol>
