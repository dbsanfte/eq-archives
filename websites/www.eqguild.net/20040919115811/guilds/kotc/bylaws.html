Characters promoted prior to 7/1/02 are exempt from this requirement.  Individual servers may have a more, or less,  restrictive level requirement based on that server's needs.</span></i></b><span

  font-family:"Copperplate Gothic Bold"'>3) [ADVANCEMENT] The guild does NOT require it's members to 'twink' or 'powerlevel' each other upon demand.  There is rarely a problem with members sharing equipment or investing some time to buff and heal other members.  Nor does the guild require it's members to sell hard won loot at below market value.  The guild DOES require that you ask a fair market price, do not gouge your fellow Knights for profit.</span></i></b><span style='font-family:"Copperplate Gothic Bold"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal align=center style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:

  font-family:"Copperplate Gothic Bold"'>4) [OFFLINE RESOURCES] The guild requires all main and alt characters to be registered with Guildmagic.com.  Guildmagic is a guild management tool that everyone can benefit from, but that means that all Knights must participate for it to be effective.  Each server has its own Guild Magic setup.  New member invitees have 7 days from joining to register with Guild Magic.  Existing members that wish to have alternates invited must have registered the alt that same day.  Members may wish to have their characters listed as Anonymous if they wish to keep their character info private. <br>

4a) The guild leadership plans large events, like epics and raids, on the message boards. Experience has shown that this "offline" planning is by far the most efficient method. The boards are:<br>
KOTC PRIVATE: pub5.ezboard.com/bknightsofthecovenant9445<br>
ALLY GUILDS(Individual allied guild message boards can be found via link off the main menu): pub117.ezboard.com/bage31330<br>
PUBLIC RAIDS: vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5429<br>
We strongly encourage all guild members to read the message boards DAILY. If you have a large project and you wish assistance of the guild leadership, you MUST use the boards and plan at least two weeks, preferably three weeks, in advance. Put the date and time of your choice in the "subject" line. Guild leadership will assist you in finding an ordinary hunting group on-the-fly, but large projects, requiring the marshalling and commitment of dozens of people, must be carefully planned ahead of time. Do not expect the guild leadership to assist you in planning large projects on-the-fly, using in-game chat.<br>

4b) As a general rule, candidates to the Knights must post a message in the General section of the message boards stating that they have read the tenets and bylaws of our Order. Exceptions to this rule may be granted under officer judgement for experienced characters with proven performance in offline organization or leadership.

  font-family:"Copperplate Gothic Bold"'>5) [DISPUTES] All differences between Knights are expected to be handled in a courteous fashion.  Failure to do so will result in both parties being placed on probation, with a second violation in 180 days resulting in being removed from the guild.  It is highly recommended that you seek out an Officer to mediate your problem to avoid such circumstances. If the actions of a member is deemed to be sever enough to consider disbandment, it shall require three Officers to agree to this action.  Each of the Officers must submit an email to the Guild's Leader (for that server) detailing his/her reasons for disbandment of said member.  The server Guild Leader reserves the right to Veto the disbandment.</</span></i></b><span style='font-family:"Copperplate Gothic Bold";

  font-family:"Copperplate Gothic Bold"'>6)  [PRIVACY] The Knights of the Covenant respect our members' right to privacy.  We respectfully ask that when a Knight wishes to not display class and/or level that they use /roleplay instead of /anon.  The reason is that /roleplay hides the information, but still shows the guild tag.  Knights in /roleplay will also show up when other members use the /who GUILD all command, where /anon does not. </span></i></b><span style='font-family:"Copperplate Gothic Bold";
