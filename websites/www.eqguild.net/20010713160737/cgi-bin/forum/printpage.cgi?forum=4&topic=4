        We lost a hard drive in the server some time on Sunday, 04/08, which caused a massive server crash. We were able to retrieve almost all the data from the crashed drive (this would be the week that our tape backup was corrupt!) and we've got the server running with a new drive. The databases that hold the data for the free homepages are backed up on the drive that didnt' crash (hooray!) butMySQL itself seems to have vanished. Please be patient as we'll be reinstalling MySQL today and restoring the data. I'll send out a message through the homepage software when everything is running again. Sorry for the inconvenience! Good news is, we're about to buy a brand NEW server in just a couple of weeks!  <br>
