<b><font color=ff8c00>T</font></b>his site doesn't have much up yet because the guild hasn't yet been formed.  There's no rush, and I'm waiting until I get 11 or so friends all online at the same time.  =)  I wanna give special thanks to Sassuliz and Binas.  They'll probably be two of the more predominant officers to go to.  So, with any luck we can turn this Legion into an army to be feared and respected.  I'm sure I'll have something up for you to view soon enough.. I write my own code, but any web developers out there might be helpfull.. ~_^ Come Back in a few days for the good stuff..  <br><br><br><br><br> </td></tr><tr><td>
<b><font color=ff8c00>B</font>rief Summary</b>: This guild was first inspired and created with the goal of helping newbies or young characters level up, and have someone to guide them through.  As people gained in strength, we could recruit higher levels, etc.  When I opened the guild to only lvl 20 and below I realized that a few people were disappointed.  I had only excluded them because I didn’t want them disappointed with all the low level characters.  Now the guild is open to any level.  Higher characters might find characters of similar levels now.  Just remember that it would be nice if you helped a newbie every now and then (without hurting yourself).  Who knows, they may grow in power before you know it.  That’s the plan anyway.<br><br><br><br><br> </td></tr><tr><td><b><font color=ff8c00>A</font>genda and Making Plans</b>: Our first order of business will be for our officers to recruit as many good soldiers as possible.  Here’s Why: We can use our numbers to make grouping easier.  If you can’t seem to get anything done soloing, and no one will take you into a group, ask you’re guild.  If no one is your level, maybe someone will just keep an eye on you or buff you why you try soloing.  If you really need an item, or need help with a quest, ask your guild and someone will probably help you.  Once we’re all settled in and working more like a unit, we can start planning events.  We’ll need to be pretty powerful, but we should eventually be able to plan full raids on certain tough mobs or guards and cities we hate.  Other events could include trade fairs, yard sales, weddings, drunken parties, and such.  I'm using Guild Magic to organize the guild.  You should probably create a character there, and you can view the current roster <A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=3046&sortby=character_name&showroles=1">Right Here</A>.
