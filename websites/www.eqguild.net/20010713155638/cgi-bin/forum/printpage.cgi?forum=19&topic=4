        I'd like to plan a guild meeting in game. So we can all meet each other! And bring along those gnomes who'd like to join the Svirfs too! Someone pick a date! :)

        Sometime on the weekend would probably be the best for most people. Count me in. I would suggest next weekend to allow a week for everyone to get it all planned out.  <br> <br>Cheers, <br>Clink

        Works for me. I've been playing my necromancer and keeping an eye out for Belwar. I need to add both of them to the guild which means getting together with an officer :). <br> <br>What areas would be best for everyone to meet? My necromancer is in Steamfont and Neiff is in Freeport.(note: my necromancer is KOS by the dwarves and can't catch a ship til she learns how to turn herself invisible in two more levels).

        How about North Karana, since it has both druid and wizard portals and is a quiet zone, on Saturday June 9th 6pm pacific time. (9pm eastern :-) ) I can invite ya Neiff and afterwards get a port to Steamfont to invite your necro. <br> <br> <br>How's that sound to everyone?? <br> <br>Kikya Indeaz <br>warrior of the 21st blade :cheesy:

        Saturday night at 9:00 est works for me as well.  I will gather a few people to come and join us.  All I will need is someone to get me out of the Overthere zone :).  Shouldn't be a problem :).  Meet at the guard tower?

        I also was an hour late to the meeting as well. Oh well me and Kikya had our own little meeting and got boozed up. Neiff, did you get in the guild? Might I suggest for next meeting it is posted on the motd for the entire preceding week, as not everyone plays every day. <br> <br>Cheers, <br>Clink Clank <br>20th Cleric

        Yes, made it there and now Neiff is in the guild. Basically we discussed a couple different things. <br> <br>1. I've a petition in to have the GMs trade the Guildleader position. Alternatly, if anyone see's Belwar, just ask him to switch it to someone on the guild and we'll work it out afterwards. <br> <br>2. Recruitement of more people. We want to get about thirty or fourty people, then we'll weed out the bad apples. Right now I think we're under the minimum requriements to have a guild and we need to get this up before they do another guildwipe. <br> <br>3. Grouping with guildmates. Need to continue fostering a culture and getting to know each other :). <br> <br>4. Once we get a good number of people who are on around the same times, we can start thinking of some guild raids or quests that people would like to do. This will help foster the culture and give the guild some identity. <br> <br> <br>The guild has been floundering to no fault of anyone in the guild, and these are steps that will help bring everything back around. It's always hard when the Guildleader takes off so soon after the guild is formed, but it's not the end of the guild. We're just getting off to a slow start :). <br> <br>(Edited by Neiff at 1:35 pm on June 11, 2001)

        Hey everyone I had a question on the Guild room and Guild bank. First of all are we goin to get one and second of all where. Nieff could you tell us if we are going to get one. If it costs lots of money i bet our guild could pitch in some money to afford it <br> <br>Azxon- Wizard ring of Svirneblin

        Have any of the officers had the pleasure of meeting Frub? &nbsp;He is an officer from the old regime. &nbsp;Frub and I have been dutifully inviting new members to the guild. &nbsp;We would love to plan some events for the new members (who are mostly lower lvl.) &nbsp;Any suggestions would certainly be helpful.

        Just wondering if I should continue inviting new members or not? &nbsp;I haven't seen any other officers online for quiet sometime. &nbsp;Are we a dead guild once more?

        Couldn't agree more that our guild needs to become more familiar with each other. &nbsp;I will be gone for the next four days. &nbsp;Has anyone seen Neiff or Frub lately? &nbsp;It would be nice to know if our guild has a leader now.
