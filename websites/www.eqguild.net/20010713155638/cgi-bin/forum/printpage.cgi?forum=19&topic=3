        Two officers of each class are needed. Once an officer, always an officer unless for some reason you're abusing the status in some way. <br> <br>Primary resonsibilites will be to interview prospective members, arrange events and otherwise promote and maintain the guild.  <br> <br>Membership should be restricted to those that actually want to be in this guild (as opposed to any guild), speak in normal words (not chat-speak), and are gnomes. <br> <br>Things have been slow these past couple weeks with Belwar having to leave so suddenly, but I hope to change this. This guild has a lot of potential and needs energetic officers to help tap that potential! So if you are interrested, email me directly or post here.

        I am already an officer and a warrior. <br>as well as I would imagine Belwar is going to become an officer? and he also is a warrior. <br> <br>Or will it be different? <br> <br> <br>------------------------------ <br>Kikya <br>warrior of the 19th season

        I should have said, Two active members from each class. So even though Belwar and Kikya are both warriors and both officers, since Belwar is no longer active, that leaves that position opening (though he'll remain an officer). <br> <br>Being Guildleader does not count as a position either, so Neiff being a Cleric will not take up a cleric slot.

        Neiff I was/am an officer when Belwar was guild leader. &nbsp;Will this position still remain in my capable hands or are you going to elect a new set of officers? &nbsp;Just curious. &nbsp;As you might guess my toon is a wizard and he is currently lvl 14. &nbsp;Glad to have you aboard by the way. :)

        Hi Frizzle! <br> <br>All current officers will remain (not smart for the new Guildleader who's coming from a different guild to upset everyone -g-). <br> <br>Belwar's idea was to have 2 officers from each class; I don't like the idea of taking away this status symbol unless it's nessisary, but I do think there needs to be two active officers for each guild to interview/recruit prospective members. Anyone that is currently an officer, but doesn't want to do this, can remain an inactive officer and someone else can take the slot to do the work. <br> <br>In all reality, an officer has one power - to remove and add members to the guild. This is an admin function that can be abused, and if it is abused will end up with the officer being removed. That's the only reason I can think of to remove someone from being an officer, short of just playing at power trips which I'm not interrested in :). <br> <br>This thread has two purposes - let me know who is currently an officer and still wants to do the work, and who is not an officer but would like to be. <br> <br>(Edited by Neiff at 6:46 pm on May 21, 2001)

        Well said Neiff. &nbsp;I would like to retain my officer status and be a viable part of the Guild. &nbsp;Please contact me anytime you wish. &nbsp;I am always available to take time out of playing for discussions of importance with any of our guild members. &nbsp;I wish the best of luck to you and all of us on our adventures within the Svirf guild.

        Hi all, <br> <br>Hey hey hey I finally found it.  My search for this web page ranked right up there with my search for clockwork XXVIIC for Manik Compelton.  <br> <br>heehee Nieff, I love my title. It "Rules". <br> <br>I would love to become an active officer of our order. I have met quite a few weefolk who would have liked to join our guild, but i didn't know who to refer them to. (Sorry Kikya, I didn't know you were an officer until the other day). I am currently a 16 lvl cleric and most of my time during the week is spent playing in the morning(us time). I would also like to get an adventuring group of us together, maybe on the weekends.  Can you imagine the sight of 6 svirfs taking down a giant? Let me know. If you can't get ahold of me in game, try Lothario_@yahoo.com <br> <br>*Clink Salutes Sharply!* <br> <br>Neiff, I hope you can come over soon. That would be great! Are you still able to keep in contact with Belwar? <br> <br>Cheers, <br>Clink <br>

        Sup Smurfs!..err..um...Svirfs! I think this web site has been made really good givin the fact that is was made so fast. I just wanted to say whats up to all my peeps and mention that Neiff would make a great guild leader. I have known her for quite awhile, and you will eventually find out that she is the kindest person of all Norrath! She gave me a hint with Bone Chips that raised my person 2 lvls in a couple of days. She is a good leader as well as a friend. I'm hoping back on EQ right now, so cya. :) <br> <br> <br> Pimptin (<-- Knows how to Rap, Ask Frizz :) Heh) <br>12th Season Wizard <Svirfneblin> <br> Zeb Server <br>

        Looks as if there are quite a few of us around the same lvl.  We should get together and adventure some :).

        I would be honored to remain as an active officer. <br>As it is I don't think we have many warriors in the guild. I'm the only female gnome warrior I know!! hehe  <br> <br>now... the truth is for the next month and a bit my job is keeping me a lil more than insanely busy. I'm trying to log on as much as I can. (We have a crazy deadline for July 1st) I'll be working some weekends too until then. But my EQ attendance is and will be lacking until then. So if it's not a problem..... I would be honored to remain as a active officer. If there is someone else you had in mind and can dedicate more time then I can (atm)... then by all means give the job to someone else :) <br> <br>------------------------ <br>Kikya Indeaz <br>Warrior of the 21 season <br>

        Hey everyone I wanted to apply to become an officer. I know I am a low lvl (Lvl 7 wizard) but i have already helped a officer (Frizzle knows what i am talkin about) get 6 or 7 new people into our guild in less than 30 MINs. I am on everquest practicly every day and so i could recruit every day. As a wizard i also get tele spells which means MAJOR RECRUITMENT. Plus i know my way around norath very well. I wont let you guys down. <br> <br>Azxon- Wizard ring of Svirfneblin
