 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 In the early morning hours of September 11 (EDT), four commercial airliners flying from the eastern United States were hijacked by yet-unidentified men using knives and the threat of bombs. Two of the airliners were deliberately crashed into New York's World Trade Center, another into the Pentagon in Washington D.C., and the fourth crashed under unknown circumstances in rural Pennslyvania. The resulting human and material loss has left the people of the United States and of the international community in a sense of disbelief. The landmark twin towers of the World Trade Center have since collapsed, the Pentagon severely damaged, and the human lives lost to this tragedy are believed to number in the thousands.
 <BR><BR>
 Within hours of television viewers watching horrified as the second airliner was televised  live smashing into the second World Trade Center tower, all non-military aviation in the United States was grounded, federal buildings evacuated, sporting events cancelled, and many businesses and other institutions shut down. The U.S. armed forces stood ready at high alert.<BR><BR>
 The television, radio, and internet were on in every household as family and friends waited together for any news and tried to come to grips with the horrible reality of the morning. In the evening President Bush returned to Washington D.C. <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010911-16.html" TARGET="_BLANK">to address</A> his injured nation. As the initial shell-shock passed over, the inevitable question arose, "Who has done this to us?"<BR><BR>
 Images on television showed children dancing in the streets of the Palestinian territories, the passing out of sweets (a symbol of celebration), and jubilation in the Iraqi central press. The Western feeling of sadness and shock slowly began to move to one of anger. The sentiment of Mr Bush, and that of the populace was a demand for justice. Through the airwaves and internet were calls for revenge. What sort of man or people could do possibly justify doing such a horrible thing, and in those darkest of hours, how could the people on the television rejoice and dance to the destruction of life?<BR><BR>
 The initial speculation and evidence points towards Sheikh Usahma Bin
 Muhammad Bin Ladin, a reclusive Saudi Arabian millionaire believed to be operating a united Islamic militant front from his exile in Afghanistan. Mr Bin Ladin and his organization have been the priority target of the American CIA since early 1996, when then President Clinton signed a directive that his network be dismantled at all costs. Mr Bush, in his speech to the nation, noted that, "We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them."<BR><BR>
 It is my belief that the demands for revenge I hear at every street corner and read on every website are a dangerous proposition. Ultimately there must be justice in this matter, of that there is no question. However, the idea of how this justice is to be served I have heard countless times in the past two days has in the past fifty years not only proven itself completely ineffective, but is also completely contrary to Mr Bush's own notion of America and its allies going "forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world." I realize my position is currently that of a small minority, and to give it any credence I suggest a look at the past fifty years of international society. <BR><BR>

 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Prior to the Second World War, there had been a clear dominance of both Western powers and Japan across Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and East Asia. In its aftermath, industrialism elevated the power of previously subservent nations. According to Samuel P Huntington, "While Asians became increasingly assertive as a result of economic development, Muslims in massive numbers were turning towards Islam as a source of identity, meaning, stability, legitimacy development, power and hope."<BR><BR>
 Despite massive urbanization, increasingly wide-spread literacy, and other effects of "modernization," the Islamic Resurgence still lacked a strong credibility, at least from the international perspective. This changed in the 1970's when the Arab nations of OPEC brought the industrialized world to its knees with its oil embargo. Needless to say this shift in the balance of power, the West's dependence on Arab oil, was a matter of great pride to those at the head of the Islamic Resurgence, namely Saudi Arabia. While it's often pointed out that the nobility of Saudi Arabia were the limited minority who benefitted financially from their new wealth, the Islamic Resurgence was not unpopular by the newly displaced poor who had migrated to the cities. It offered a certain dignity and meaning, very much unlike the Hinduism of nearby India, to those of all walks of life.<BR><BR>
 Even a stronger sense of us versus them was brought about by the proxy wars fought during the Cold War on Muslim soil, most notably that of the Afghan invasion by the Soviet Union. During this time the American CIA indirectly supported the Afghan resistence through training and material support, including Mr Bin Ladin. To the Afghans, Mr Bin Ladin was a very popular figure, having come from a vastly rich family in Saudi Arabia shortly after completing his university eduction to fight in the trenches against the Soviets. After the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, Mr Bin Ladin returned to Saudi Arabia as a hero figure.<BR><BR>
 The Islamic movement was still progressing strongly in the waning days of the Cold War. As Mr Huntington notes, "In 1995 every country with a predominantly Muslim population, except Iran, was more Islamic and Islamist culturally, socially, and politically than it was fifteen years earlier."

 <DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Islamic Militantism</b></DIV><BR>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 The Arab regimes had long viewed with contempt the United Nations mandate which created a Jewish state on soil occupied by Jews, Palestinians, Lebanese, and Arabs prior to the Second World War. This was compounded by three things. One was the rise in Jewish Orthodoxism which saw the very vocal idea of Zionism come to the stage, that of Israel being the promised land of David, the long-awaited Jewish nation. Another was the rise of wealthy and influential Jewish groups in New York, who greatly influenced America's support of Israel, and whos position was strengthened by the Soviet support of Syria and other Arab nations that stood opposed to Israel. Most importantly, they saw the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Palestine refugees from the lands granted to Israel in 1949 as a combined Israeli and Western move against Islam.<BR><BR>
  This was compounded after the military failures of Syria and Egypt in 1967 and 1973, when Israelis were able to capture even more Palenstine territories in their counter-attack. Israel began removing Palestianians from their homes in favor of building Jewish settlements and Kibbutzim (communal Jewish farms). With the flood of Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union and the emigration of Jews from Ethiopia in the 1980's, the United States' increasingly strong position in the power struggle of the cold war, and the dependence of Arab States on Western currency and banking institutions, it became fairly apparent that a large military operation could not be won against their enemies. 
 Resistance instead took the form of many smaller organizations, such as Yasser Arafat's PLO, Mr Bin Ladin's 'al Qaeda', and other groups which initially had a wide variety of goals and plans of obtaining them.<BR><BR>
 Alongside their unwavering support for Israeli policy and statehood, the United States and its allies became increasingly suspicious of the Islam Resurgence as the result of the oil embargo and the actions of various extremist militants in Africa such Idi Amin and Qadafy.<BR><BR>
 When Saddam Hussein's army invaded Kuwait, a very visual act of political and economic greed which pitted Muslims against Muslims, the world was presented with possibly its best opportunity for some sort of peace. Saudi Arabia relucantly allowed the forces of NATO to use its soil to stage its military operation, there was increasing sympathy in Jordan towards the Israelis being bombed by Iraqi SCUD missiles, Israel itself (under strong western pressure) did not retaliate directly against Iraq to prevent Mr Hussein from moving the focus from something even his Arab neighbors detested to a war of the West against Islam. From the perspective of the West observing through the media, this was almost a perfect war: the Iraqis withdrew from Kuwait, the West had minimal casualties, justice was served, and everyone was happy. Unfortunately, this isn't the case at all, and west made a few critical flaws in its thinking.<BR><BR>
 The first was their failure to realize that after the successful military defeat of the Iraqi invasion forces and the destruction of Mr Hussein's military machine, their position was already optimal. In my opinion it is highly unlikely that Mr Hussein, having lost credibility with his Arab neighbors and have misjudged the West's resolve would've been able to retain his power in Iraq for very long. We ask ourselves why, then, Mr Hussein is still in power today, incredibly popular among his own people, and increasingly becoming more the hero, less the menace in the eyes of his Arab neighbors. It because the West used its bombers and cruise missiles to not only resolve the military situation, but to attempt to resolve a political one as well. Baghdad was saturated with missiles, many based on guess-work as to Saddam's whereabouts. His political institutions, in the middle of highly urbanized areas were bombed severely. Mr Hussein's press puts the number of Iraqi civilians killed at near a million, the western powers insist "civilian casualties were minimal", the truth is most likely somewhere in between. As noted, Mr Hussein is still alive today. But through the frantic attempts to remove him from power in this indiscriminate fashion, he has become a martyr in the eyes of many Iraqis and many other Arabs. When brothers, mothers, and children are killed one is unlikely to look at the underlying political reasons (i.e. Saddam's attempt to further his oil interests through invading Kuwait), but rather lust for the blood of those who directly did this (the Evil West in the eyes of the Iraqis). This has since been compounded by the American led embargo on Iraq, which has only served to increase the suffering of Iraq's populace and every day strengthens Saddam's position.<BR><BR>
 It saddens me to see today the calls for revenge and war on the people we see dancing in the streets of Cairo and the Palestinian territories. It was not the American populace that killed thousands of innocent Iraqis during the Gulf War, nor is it now the Muslim populace that has killed thousands of New Yorkers and Americans in the past forty-eight hours.

 <DIV ALIGN="CENTER"><B>The Recent Situation</b></DIV><BR>
 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 It's really a sad thing, but almost nothing done today, by either the mainstream Islamic nations, nor Israel and the United States, is in any way productive towards peace. Each step only compounds more hatred and mistrust. Israel's policy against Palenstinian insurgencies has long been that of "ten eyes for an eye," a brutal system of unproportional retaliation against every act of violence by the Palestinian organizations. I don't think anyone would argue with me that this has been completely ineffective. Now, almost a year after the latest round of violence, we're still seeing images every day of terrible violence throughout Israel in an seemingly endless cycle.<BR><BR>
 The right-wing elements in Israel have been strengthened by the violence, as evident by Mr Sharon's recent coming to power. The mandate Mr Sharon has been given by his voters isn't one of peace, but one of revenge. His only limit in doing so is that he must work within the restraints of his American allies without angering them too much. Unfortunately as we saw last week when Americans stormed out of the international conference on racism when the issue of Palestinian treatment at the hands of the Israelis was brought up, these restraints are unfortunately extremely loose and entrenched in American politics.<BR><BR>
 The failure of Israel's policy is that Islamic militantism and terrorism will only cease to thrive when, according to CIA Arab Affair specilist Raymond Close, "terrorism will thrive as long as the Palestinian population is obsessed with the injustice of their lot and consumed with despair." With each strategic killing of a Palestinian leader, which every round of stone throwing answered by machine gun fire from tanks or bombing from planes, the Palestian  resolve only grows stronger. Support for Israel and U.S. policy in the Middle East from the previously moderate Islamic regimes and western allies other than the United States is slowly waning. France and Russia are growing more vocal in their opposition to the Iraqi embargo, and the world is taking a harder stance on Israel.<BR><BR>
 In 1998, two United States embassies in Dar Es Salaam and Riyahd were bombed by assosciates of Mr Bin Ladin. President Clinton retaliated with cruise missile attacks on a factory believed to be producing arms in Sudan and suspected militant training camps in Afghanistan. It was later admitted by American authorities that the factory in Sudan actually produced medical supplies for African hospitals, and that intelligence reports had been mistaken. This was done in a hope that shooting unmanned cruise missiles at the "infrastructure of terrorism" would solve something. As Mr Close suggests, "Terrorism's best asset, in the final analysis, is the fire in the bellies of its young men, and that fire cannot be extinguished by Tomahawk missiles. If intelligent Americans can accept that premise as a reasonable basis for dealing with this nemesis, why is it so difficult for our leaders to speak and act accordingly?"<BR><BR>
 To answer Mr Close's question, my response is that despite our stated ideals "of providing democracy and freedom at any cost," there is actually a limit to how much we will pay, and that our moral yearnings are to a great degree limited by what is polically convenient. As evidence I point two events in Africa during the 1990's. When all hell broke loose in Mogadishu and Somalia, the United States under Mr Clinton responded fairly promptly. Initially the American presence was welcomed by the populace, as they brought with them security, food, medicine, and peace. When, in the eyes of American policy makers, one particular warlord became their "pick" to lead the country, even if their assumption was that he was the most capable of bringing democracy was correct, they made a humanitarian issue a political one. Sentiment quickly changed, and when an army trained to combat the tanks of the Soviet Union was faced with 10 year olds wielding AK-47 machine guns and several Americans were killed, it became too high a price to pay. What had gone so wrong, we asked ourselves, that only a few years before we had removed the evil Iraqi menace with our military, and now find ourselves retreating as fast as we can from an increasingly hostile populace? It was that the politically appealing solution of instituting an "acceptable" leader was the most convenient solution, but not what was actually needed. The price of actual peace, by helping the Somalians out of their misery was abandoned in favor of politics.<BR><BR>
 This lesson was an expensive one. When a few years later the Tutsi's of Rwanda were being slaughtered and hacked to death wholesale by the Hutu majority, it was essentially ignored until the western media began beaming images to our television sets of decapitated children, and we found ourselves with no moral alternative than to react with disgust. Even then, Clinton and the American policy makers could ill afford another Mogadishu, and no real intervention happened other than politically correct statements about how "saddened they were, and how freedom would prevail." The number of innocent people lost to this human tragedy will probably never be exactly known. The clear limit we are willing to pay for peace has limited the options of our goals to "forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world."<BR><BR>

 After yesterday's terrible events, realization has hit home that terrorism knows no international boundaries. Our policies in other nation's affect our own freedom even and the sanctity of our most revered icons. It is my own, and most people's natural instincts to seek out our enemies and bring them to justice. But the cruel reality of international terrorism, and the underlying reasons that fuel it, is that our enemy is a hidden one. When we are presented with the rejoice of certain Muslims on TV in our time of misery, it becomes extremely difficult to view them as anything but our enemy. I have in the past forty-eight hours heard more racist terms than in the past three years combined. People are crying out to our mighty military to "go nuke those raghead bastards into the ground." We need our revenge, to satiate this terrible bloodlust we've built up as more of the carnage and destruction of the past few days unfolds. We know that we have the mightiest military and  the biggest bombs and to quote someone on a message board I read, "how dare anyone do this to us, how could they not know we're the strongest nation on earth and are going to blow them to bits."<BR><BR>
 Bringing Mr Bin Ladin to justice is obviously extremely important, but right now Mr Bush's most politically convenient reaction is probably wide-scale air attacks on targets believed to be part of Mr Bin Ladin's terrorist network residing in nations we are not technically at war with. We are hoping to take ten eyes for an eye from the terrorists, or seek our enemies where they previously didn't exist. I would like to think that in the past ten years we've actually learned something  about our lessons and experiences with combatting terrorism, hatred, and its underlying causes. The price we will need to pay to actually solve the issue and not seek vigilante, blind justice in our moments of rage is a long, slow, painful one.<BR><BR>
 I'm only asking people to take a breath and think about what I've said for just a moment. This is a democracy we live in, and our leaders are in power because we've chosen them to echo our will. Is the mandate we want to give Mr Bush really that non-violent Islamic elements who are morally opposed to what the United States stands for are now our enemies because they are the only ones we can see and act upon? For truly this is all that the easy route would accomplish. Those that we can cannot see, our true enemies, will only grow to be greater martyrs and stronger with each bomb we launch.<BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>
 <HR>
 update: I guess I wasn't too clear in some points of this article, which prompted a few legitimate responses.. here's one and my reply, hope this helps clear up the point I'm trying to get at a bit: <BR><BR>
 
 <I>During the Gulf War Americans were not celebrating the deaths of Iraqi civilians. Certainly we were proud of the combined forces victory over the Iraqi military - but I don't remember Americans shooting automatic weapons in the air celebrating the deaths of any civilians. 
 <BR><BR>
 Also, Saddam Hussein has a habit of using his own populace as human shields. Wish you had mentioned that. 
 <BR><BR>
 Also, Saddam Hussein has failed to comply with UN Initiatives in regards to chemical weapon inspections and production. 
 <BR><BR>
 The Israeli "10 eyes for 1 eye" is actually very effective. Perhaps too effective. Palestine is a shell of what it once was and its population largely displaced. 
 <BR><BR>
 As far as the conference on racism - Arabs can't have it both ways. They can't say "When we hate someone it is a holy Jihad, when we are hated it is racism." 
 <BR><BR>
 Bush was president when we first entered Somalia. Clinton got us out of that mess. 
 <BR><BR>
 There are certain reasons we do go to war. Inner conflicts (You use the Hutu's as an example) is not one. 
 <BR><BR>
 Are you suggesting we become the world's policeman? 
 <BR><BR>
 I see you convienently left out Bin Laden's declaration of war on the US in 1993. I see you left out the Kobar towers bombing. I see you left out the bombing of the world trade center in 1993. I see you chose not to address the USS Cole attack. 
 <BR><BR>
 Yes - Bush's most expedient course of action is to carpet bomb them back into the stone age. 
 </I>
 <BR><BR>
 Sorry about the factual mistakes like Bush being president when we first moved in, most of this was written from memory, and I'm not a reporter, just another guy with an opinion. 
 <BR><BR>
 few responses though.. 
 <BR><BR>
 1. I'm in no way suggesting the U.S. becomes the world policemen, the whole bit about Africa is an attempt to demonstrate that in the past 10 years it's become politically impossible to accomplish anything but a button pushing war. Unfortunately a button pushing war has proven itself extremely ineffective when it comes to combatting terrorism. 
 <BR><BR>
 2. I didn't discuss the other terrorist attacks by Bin Laden's and his group because they are beside the point of what I'm writing. I'm in no way attempting to justify what he has done and am just as pissed as the next guy. It's stating beyond the obvious that Bin Laden needs to be brought to justice. What I'm saying is that all previous attacks that have poorly discrimated between the people who actually cause the problems and things which simply stand for or are symbolic of the problems have failed miserably in preventing futher terrorism. These problems are solved in a court of justice (see Qadafy eventually turning over the Lockerbie suspects to the tribunal in the Hague) through exerting diplomatic pressure and international cooperation. Attempting to do it any other way has not only not solved the problem (see Hussein and Bin Laden still roaming freely) but it has strengthed Hussein and Bin Laden's cause. 
 <BR><BR>
 Guess the way I can make this point most clearly is by the Taleban ambassador to Pakistan's recent statements: http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1539000/1539468.stm 
 <BR><BR>
 If we were to attack suspected terrorist training camps next week in Sudan, Etheopia, Egypt and Afghanistan(theoretical) and again it becomes an issue of Muslims vs. the West rather than Justice vs. a criminal, and you have pretty much guaranteed he's going to walk freely a lot longer and have even more people supporting his cause. 
 <BR><BR>
 3. As for Bin Laden's declaration of war (1996 actually), this was sited by President Clinton as the justification for shooting missiles into Sudan and Afghanistan (again nations we are not technically at war with). This is a single person or organization the United States is at war with. By attributing every Islamic Militant attack to either him, his organization, or his declaration of war, nothing is accomplished but elevating his status in the eyes of those who are morally opposed to what the United States stands for yet are not part of the violent problem themselves. 
 <BR><BR>
 4. I doubt that Israel's policy has been effective in any way in stopping terrorism. As evidence, look at the past 30 days news on your favorite news source, guarantee at least 29 of them have reports of fresh violence in Israel. The children throwing rocks are venting their anger, they are not the same people who strap bombs to their chest and blow up a bus or restaurant. By brutally retaliating against them you only fuel their support for the criminals that actually do. 
 <BR><BR>
 5. As for siting the displacement of most of the Palestinians in 1949 as a "success" that really troubles me to be honest. Lebanon was at that point the -only- democratic Islamic nation in existence (something positive yes?). Their flood of 300,000 refugees explused by Israel after the mandate strained Lebanon severely (its not a very big country at all). After the 1967 explusions from both Israel and some more from Jordan the situation was completely out of control. The refugees began breeding violence and ultimately led to the collapse of Lebanon, allowing Syria to exert strong control, and at the same time fostering a host of new terrorist groups from within the massive refugee camps like Arafat's PLO. Whether explusing a half million people from their homes is a "success" is your opinion, and I have have no moral authority to question it. As for this being a "success in stopping terrorism", I think the history of the PLO, the shit that happened in Beirut and Civil War in Lebanon are pretty strong evidence against that. 
 <BR><BR>
 6. As for Hussein defying the UN sanctions you are correct, that he did, and it has strengthed his posision even more by trying to apply even more pressure through the embargo as the result of his refusal. The "food for oil" program was an afterthought which was way too little and too late to correct this error of judgement on the part of the UN. Simply put, Hussein like Bin Ladin needs to be brought to justice, but there is a right and a wrong way of doing that. Putting the brunt of the burdon on the innocent is definitely the wrong way of going about that, and has managed to made Saddam almost a God-like figure in his own country and many other Arabs for his demonstrated resistance. 
 <BR><BR>
 7. As for Saddam using human shields, most likely true and utterly despicable. Tried to point out in the first place that trying to bomb Saddam himself was a poorly conceived idea, and that he probably wouldn't be the leader of Iraq right now if Baghdad hadn't been so severely bombed.
 <BR><BR>
 Anyways, appreciate you taking the time to read this. This is the first article I've ever written and I guess I suck at getting my point across. In no way trying to argue that Bin Ladin isn't an extremely evil person, point I'm trying to make is that there is a right and a wrong solution to every issue, and when it comes to terrorism the wrong solution is usually the easiest and most politically convenient.
