Kael Arena was camped to the eyeballs, so rather than wait in line we headed to Kaesora. We headed down into the depths to find <a href="Xalgoz.jpg" target="_blank">Xalgoz</a> in the hope that he would relinquish some <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=692" target="_blank">Xalgozian Fangs</a> for us. This item comprises one half of the key for Howling Stones. We did fairly well, collecting 7 in total. We will of course return to make sure everyone has one.

We headed to burning woods and setup camp just outside the Giant Fort. Whilst pulling from here in the hope of a treeweave, whilst Dextal and Rinaldi were busy hunting the mobs on the spawn cycles. Gullerback was happy to provide everybody who needed one with a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1063" target="_blank">Tattered Mantle</a>, whilst Azdalen and <a href="Gylton.jpg" target="_blank">Gylton</a> finally provided enough scales for 7 people to complete their <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=355" target="_blank">Wurmslayer</a> quest.

Sol B was the target as Manthas lead a raid down to visit the Efreeti Lord Djarn. Although he was not feeling very sociable and only showed his face once before link issues brought the raid to a close. This was very good practice as this will be the location of many a raid to come.

We had planned to raid the Plane of Hate. Unfortunately this was not possible, so instead after trying a number of locations the Hole was visited. It was certainly entertaining watching a few people wriggle through the gap whilst someone searched for the key vendor. Although it was a fairly brief raid, ending with the death of about half the people after dropping down to the city area. We did win the battle and coordination was excellent.

Had a good run at Chardok today after a bad start when some unknown person trained 15 mobs on us as we were setting up =/. Recovered nicely after that and going things going clearing a good ways inside. Had some very nice drops with a <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/sarnakbattleshield.html" target="_blank">Sarnak Battle Shield</a> for Tignous, <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/sarnakarcanefetish.html" target="_Blank">Sarnak Arcane Fetish</a> for Saldirbot, a metal pipe which will eventually be multi-quested for Skarrad's epic, and a 7 INT necklace which went to the LoTH members who joined us today.

Did a quick <a href="http://wsphotofews.excite.com/032/Mp/Wb/5T/FV81281.jpg" target="_blank">mini-raid</a> on Mistmoore today to complete Skeeth's <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/blackfurboots.html" target="_blank">Black Fur Boots</a> which are an interim part of the shaman epic. Picked up an <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/advisorrobe.html">robe</a> for Jaal too while triggering the wolf for the epic fight.<BR><BR>
As a sidenote I've finally found a place that will let me host screenshots and link them for free, so should be able to add shots to the news updates until this goes the way of Geocities. On that note here are a couple of shots from our Kael Raid there other day.

Had a unsuccesful Phinny run the other night due to some mistakes getting down there and a bad pull (by me hehe), but this fish has a price on its head now, so expect a news update to that effect within a week. Tonight we had a guild meeting at the Toxx wizard spires to get some feedback on things. Members who weren't able to come please check the recap on the private forums.<BR><BR>
Some people may wonder what sort of things we discuss in the super-secret "Officer's Forum", where all the guild's schemes and plans get thought up. So I present this <a href="http://wsphotofews.excite.com/029/qv/c5/Hr/1n38647.jpg" target="_blank">little glimpse</a> into the sort of intellectual brain-storming we do behind closed doors.

Lots been going on lately. Sunday due to server issues we weren't able to go kill Phinny. Today we had a quick Sir Lucan kill to complete Cinnabar's Soulfire, and did a late-night mini raid on Chardok. City of Mist was also raided last Friday, though I wasn't there I guess they had some nice luck on loot drops. Grats to several new members that have joined our ranks in the past few days, good seeing some new faces in guildchat. All September news has been archived in the <a href="oldnews.html" target="_self">Old News</a> area.
