<b><center>The Dawn of the Femdarms</center></b><p><p>
 
     The Femdarms are a proud and honorable people born out of the bitter conflict of revolution. Hundreds of years ago there once came a fierce and mighty army. Like a mighty wind of frost these men came out of the north bent on conquering the peaceful folk of the south. With the element of surprise as their ally, the invading army captured thousands of square miles of rich fertile land for their own. Mercilessly they slaughtered all the daring men who opposed them. The women folk were taken as captives and used for their vile lusts and sent to work in mineral rich mines located on an occupied tropical island. Before the rest of the continent was able to organize and mount a defensive the northern army had captured the entire northern half of the continent. For years invaders and defenders fought a bitter war, neither regaining or capturing any significant ground. With both sides weary of war, a truce was finally called for. Strong battlements were constructed along the boarder that separated the now two distinct countries. For hundreds of years they lived as such while the women on the island still remained captive and enslaved. But the army of the north, could not have foreseen the coming foe that loomed on the horizon.<p>

     Used by the men for their pleasure, the women soon began to bare children. Boy babies were sent to the mainland after they were weaned to be brought up in the war like ways of the north. Female babies were allowed to be kept and eventually took the place of the previous generation. Over the years however a change was occurring in the offspring. Due to the arduous work of the mines, the women became genetically altered to be better suited for the environment in which they lived. With each generation the women became progressively stronger. There were those who managed to escape the mines and find refuge among sympathetic dwarfs who shared the island. One particular slave noted the significant change that had come over her and her sisters. Taking an interest in sword play, eventually a plan began to develop in her mind. Organizing all the slaves together and enlisting the aid of dwarfs, fierce warriors in their own right, the female slaves trained in the art of war. Secretly the slaves and the dwarfs made plans for revolution until one day the north’s unseen foe emerged. Together with the Dwarfs as allies, they fell upon their enemy like a storm and wrenched their freedom from their captors. Now cut off from their precious minerals, the northern army could no longer finance their war effort and fell easy prey to the defenders and were driven back to their original boarders.<p>

     For the women on the island this had been the only home they new. They had no ties to go back to on the mainland. So there they stayed and built a society of their own. Trade with the dwarfs was established. Over time the females learned the skill of the sea and built mighty warships to insure that their way of life would never be threatened. Brief visits to the mainland resulted in affairs with men which in turn resulted in procreation. Male babies spawned were taken to the mainland and given to deserving families, while female babies would be brought up in the new ways of the <b>Femdarms</b>, (Female at Arms).
