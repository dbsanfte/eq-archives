 <center><h1 class="orange2">     General Raid for Seirien's Rogue epic quest</h1></center>
 
 
      
 <br /><br />
 
 
 <SPAN class=orange><B>DATE:</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 Saturday March 22, 2003
 
 <br /><br />
 <SPAN class=orange><B>TIME:</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 9:00 pm CST (US)
 
 <br /><br />
 
 <SPAN class=orange><B>LOCATION:</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 Kithicor Forest at the Highpass Zone.
 
 <br /><br />
 <SPAN class=orange><B>OBJECTIVE:</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 Cause General V'ghera to spawn and  to kill him for Seirien's Rogue epic quest.
 <br /><br />
 
 
 <SPAN class=orange><B>MOB INFORMATION:</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 The dark elves and Brigadier G'Tav are 55+ and KOS to everyone. 
 General V`ghera is a level 63 shadow knight, casts several dangerous spells, hits for over 200, and has a 500 damage lifetap proc, as well as a huge harmtouch. He also has around 32,000 hit points.
 <br /><br />
 
 <SPAN class=orange><B>RAIDING PARTY REQUIREMENTS:</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 A party of around 30 people, ideally 50+ with good mix of tanks, nukers, healers, etc., is needed to kill the General safely. To succeed withg this Raid we will need to ask our friends and allies to assist us.  If you know someone 50+ who would be able to join us, please let Raknorok, Kuli or Chasman know as soon as possible. (Note: more than 50 people in the zone can cause bad lag.)
 <br /><br />
 
 <SPAN class=orange><B>RAID LEADER(S):</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 Raknorok, assisted by Kuli and Chasman.
 
 <br /><br />
 <SPAN class=orange><B>MAIN TANK (MT):</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 The MT is Ballaquesta, with Kuli as her back up tank (BT). (This may change on the day of the Raid.)  Please set up appropriate assist keys -- this will ensure the main aggro is on the main tank. Also if everyone uses an assist key, there is less chance of breaking a mez in the case of adds etc. etc.
 
 
 <br /><br />
 <SPAN class=orange><B>LOOTING/MASTER LOOTER:</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 A Master Looter will be assigned to loot all mobs OTHER than the Brigadier and the General.
 The General and the Brigadier will not be touched by anyone other than Seirien.  
 <br /><br />
 
 <SPAN class=orange><B>RAID PROCEDURE:</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 The text below describes a general procedure commonly used to raid the General and succeed. (Adapted from several web sources) Variations may occur in combat or to accomodate the needs of the raid. Please use this to familiarize yourself with the intended course of action but pay attention to the Raid Leader and your group leaders during the raid.
 <br /><br />
 The raiding party should begin assembling at the Highpass Hold zone border area (in Kithicor) at 8:00 pm CST --We will begin to form up groups and prepare for battle. 
 
 We will try to time the actual beginning of the Raid for 7am or so in game,  so that the bulk of the undead will be despawned for the raid.  
 <br /><br />
 When buffed and ready give your pullers/rangers the word to start individually pulling the dark elves from the house over to the raiding party.
 <br /><br />
 Kill the dark elves as they are pulled  until there is only one dark elf left preferably Brigadier G`tav. (One dark elf MUST remain for Seirien to turn in his sealded box and spawn the General.)
 <br /><br />
 BE SURE your pullers leave ONE of the dark elves behind, otherwise you will not be able to turn in your Sealed Box to spawn the General!  
 <br /><br />
 NOTE: If the Brigadier aggroes on someone, you will not be able to give him the Sealed Box until he loses aggro. Should this happen the enchanter should charm him so that he is aggroed on nobody except the enchanter, and then to mez and mem blur him over and over until it takes, and he forgets what he's doing. If you kill him too soon, then the Rogue cannot turn in his Sealed Box to spawn the General and the respawn time for the Brigadier and the other dark elves is between 8 and 24 hours.
 <br /><br />
 Once the DE house is cleared EXCEPT for Brigadier G`tav -- or whichever DE is le -- move the entire raiding party to the road north of the DE house, at approximately +1100, +2600  --- do not get to close the DE house on the way there. Everyone should then rebuff as needed and prepare for the main combat with the General!
 <br /><br />
 
 At this point, only Brigadier G`tav should be inside the house. Seirien will sneak-hide, move into the house, stand BEHIND the Brigadier, unhide and give him the box. Due to the Brigadier's positioning, and where General V`ghera spawns (he always spawns IN the house, regardless of the location of the dark elf you hand the box to), Seirien SHOULD have time to re-hide before the General notices him. 
 <br /><br />
 
 At this point, the waiting puller can solo-pull the General over to the raid party, while Seirien sneaks away from the house, and goes to join the party to participate in the battle!
 <br /><br />
 
 Once the General is dead, Seirien will loot the General's Pouch off his corpse and if it drops, the Cazic Quill.
 
 
 
 
 <br /><br />
 <SPAN class=orange><B>OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</B></SPAN> 
       <BR>
 
 <ol>
 <li><b>PLEASE BE ON TIME!!</b> We cannot stress this enough, the raid will start ON TIME.  If not enough people are available at the raid start time, the raid will be cancelled and Seirien will not attain his epic.
 <br /><br />
 <li>If you are running late and want to join the raid, you will need to secure your own transportation to the area.
 <br /><br />
 <li>Please bring enough food to last for several hours.
 <br /><br />
 <li>Everyone should have an assist key set to the main tank and one for the backup  (At this time the Main Tank is Ballaquesta and the backup is Kuli.) Be sure you use this key to target the correct mobs. Don't target mobs individually please.
 <br /><br />
 <li>Please do not go afk during the raid except for emergencies, let your group leader and the raid leader know if something happens and you have to leave.
 <br /><br />
 <li><b>If the camp, zone or evac orders are given by Raknorok, Kuli or Chas please take the proper action immediately.</b>
 <br /><br />
 <li>For those whose character uses a component or components to buff others, heal, summon, corpse summon etc. --- please ask for a disbursement of either gems or platinum to purchase them  -- this is a service provided by your guild treasury to make raiding fair for all!  (The Guild DOES have the funds to provide these for official raids such as this, there is no need for individuals to bear the costs.
 <br /><br />
 <li>In the event of a death, a rezz will be provided them either by a guild cleric or paid for from guild funds.   The same is true should a corpse summoning be needed.
 <br /><br />
 <li>Castyion should be available in Nexus at the Bazaar zone an hour before the raid starts to dispense KEI to those who need it.
 <br /><br />
 <li>An attempt will be made to also find a 60+ cleric who can cast Aego or Virtue for all melee types, however we cannot guarantee this will be available. If you are very short on funds, please ask for a disbursement from the treasury to cover getting Aego if you need it.
