        The time has come to consider getting the Tashania spell. Do any of you other chanters need to do it too or do you already have them?  <br> <br>If any of you do fancy it, it might be less of a drudge and more fun to do it together- the quest entails visiting Neriak, Halas and Erud so those enchant metal/illusion spells you been after for so long would be attainable too. Was even considering combining the Stein of Maggok quest too- might be best to keep it simple however :) <br> <br>Let me know waht you think or even if it's worth going through all the troubles at all? <br> <br>Khazbee

        Mmmmm... stein of moggok... my chanter could use one of those... (she's only level 8 at the moment, I need to start working with her) &nbsp;so Opalecia would be more than happy to pitch in for that quest. As for the others, I'd be willing to help however I can... but I'm only lvl 25 so if it's really ultra dangerous, I might be more a hinderance than a help.
