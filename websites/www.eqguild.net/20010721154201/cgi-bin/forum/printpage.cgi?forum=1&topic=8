        It's possible this is only on The Rathe server, I don't know. <br> <br>People keep saying it's a "GM Event" and someone in the zone said they got an NPC to tell them it was retaliation for something that happened in Qeynos...  <br> <br>If you haven't been in the zone, the whole thing is green like Tox is... well it comes and goes, sometimes it's just a tinge on the horizon, sometimes it's so thick you can't see the trees. &nbsp;Messages like "you feel nauseous" and "your vision blurs momentarily" and such keep appearing. There are rabid animals all over the zone (a rabid griffene? a rabid griffon? Never seen them before this) and hoardes of green beetles called "swarmlings" that attack in groups of around 10... <br> <br>Does anyone have the scoop? what the hey is going on??

        OK from what I was told by a good friend of mine , who was in zone when this started, it's a plague from Bertox . He says there was a zone wide message saying that Bertox the god had trapped/enslaved/imprisoned gods to &nbsp;his plane (of Disease)  <br> Now the theory going about higher up &nbsp;is that since most GMs themselves are going to nk and &nbsp;do not know &nbsp;whats going on, meaning it's some VI &nbsp;event and not &nbsp;a GM event, that perhaps VI are about to open a new planes called (maybe) Plane of Disease. /shrug <br> <br>Sounds possible but who really knows.All I know is that &nbsp;any GM's I spoke to say they dont know whats happening and &nbsp;they then port into NK to see for themselves lol. <br> <br>I got me 51st Warrior ready to go at a moments notice no matter what happens lol.

        Hail and well met all, <br> &nbsp; Well, I have read as much as I can about this plague on the plains of Karana, and it seems there is more going on then just this plague. &nbsp;It seems that on some servers, that Firionia Vie, as well as Innorak's daughter has been spoted, and lots of unusual events are taking place in the lands of Norrath. <br> &nbsp; The plague of Karana started as this: <br>Mordavin Telase, husband of Azibelle Spavin was hung by (under orders from) Antonius Bayle for conspiracy. &nbsp;Apparently Mordavin was conducting research for Bertoxx (the god of plagues), as well. &nbsp;Well, Azibelle got a bunch of people together and did a ceremony and called on Bertoxx to come to the Karana's. &nbsp;He did. &nbsp;He announced things to the whole zone about how he was going to "bless the land" with three things, the green mist that comes during the rains, the rabid animails, and the swarmlings (who sometimes spawn with a Mother, who cons red to a level 30), and the Karanas have never been the same since. &nbsp;If you talk with the farmers in the Karana's, they will tell you this story. <br> &nbsp; i suggest that if you are interested in finding out more, to check out this website. &nbsp;www.1fol.cjb.net &nbsp;on their message boards there is a board called &nbsp;(something like) We are at WAR and HERE is all the Info. &nbsp;Warning, it is VERY long, and indepth...lots about the details of the History of the lands of Norrath. &nbsp;There are over 13 pages of posts there, so make sure you have some time to read them. <br> &nbsp;Anyway, hope that helps a bit! &nbsp;

        Anytime OpalCat. &nbsp;I am still rather new to the game, only have been playing for about 5 months now, but even I have heard the stories about what happened before Kith turned into the "safe" passage during the daytime and the horrors of the undead roaming there in the evenings. &nbsp;I still do not have the whole details straight, however, from what I do understand, that Firionia Vie and Innorak's daughter (I'm sorry I always forget her name, though remember it begins with an 'L') were at war. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp;at that site, they say that Innorak's daughter was betrayed by him, or something, and now she is in an alliance with Bertoxx...thus this would link the plagues in the Karana's, possibly, to the semingly continous war between Firionia Vie, and Inny's daughter... <br> &nbsp; They also say that people (NPC's) are poping up everywhere that are new, speaking that they are from the Council of Heros...am not sure if this is just part of new quests, or if it somehow is all related. &nbsp;Anyway, more info to chew on...I am sure that it will be most interesting to see what is going on after the patch tonight...unfortunatly, I was unable to get in game before they started with the 2nd patch...maybe there was another "hiccup", such as was mentioned in that site...where LFay the sky turned blood red, and was overrun with undead....anyway, if anyone manages to get any more info, can we post here? &nbsp;My guild is trying to figure it out, and if there might be anything we might be able to do...thanks! <br>
