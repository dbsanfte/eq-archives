<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" FACE="Lucida Blackletter">As
stated by our name, we are, of course, Elven. If your heart is
pure you will remain a loved member of a growing family. We must
all be the best we can be, to become the elite! We must be honorable,
helpful, wise and strong. Only together can we accomplish our
goals. These goals are simple, but never easy. We strive to become
the greatest of the guilds. Wear your guild names proudly, Ladies
and Gentlemen. For the actions of one of us can spoil our good
name for everyone.</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

Rules:</FONT></U></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" FACE="Lucida Blackletter">Light
side elves only. (Exceptions to be made only at by majority vote
of ALL guild officials. And even then, the only exception possible
would be a dark elf, having proved him/her self to be of good,
and pure of heart and having turned his back on his own people.)</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" FACE="Lucida Blackletter">Roleplaying
is of course, a choice, but not deemed necessary for EGOL. However,
if you turn on "roleplaying" we must insist that you
DO indeed roleplay, and not simply be anonymous with a purple
name. Unless you are roleplaying, please refrain from being anonymous.</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" FACE="Lucida Blackletter">We
must at least ATTEMPT to answer calls for help. All too often
has come the time when each of us has asked for assistance, <BR>
and even with people nearby, no one came. This, however, does
not mean get yourself killed trying to help, if the person has<BR>
obviously bitten off more than they could chew. *We may NOT deliberatly
run trains of mobs to another person or group <BR>
without warning. Training without warning is indeed the scourge
of Norrath, and will not be tolerated. Sacrificing yourself<BR>
would be preferable rather than run a train to unwary folk. Reports
of this type of action WILL be investigated, and if found to<BR>
be truthful, that member may be sanctioned. HOWEVER. If the reverse
is found to be true, then justice will be<BR>
sought! We must protect our own. We may not deliberately Kill
Steal. However, if someone asks for help, and one of us <BR>
annihilates the problem at hand, may to the victor go the spoils.
Lastly, we must treat others with the dignity and <BR>
respect they deserve, lest they prove otherwise.</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Lucida Blackletter">Guild
Functions and Meetings</FONT></U></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" FACE="Lucida Blackletter">Members
may request a guild meeting if there are sufficient circumstances
to require it. Please, if you require that a meeting be convened,
speak to an officer.<BR>
On occasion we as fun loving creatures need a break! Therefore,
we will attempt to have the occasional activity for our members.
Anyone who has any suggestions for activities, please feel free
to pass them on to activities commitee. The attendance for such
activities will NOT be mandatory. (Altough your fellow guildmates
may wonder where you were!)</FONT></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><I><U><FONT COLOR="#ffff00" FACE="Lucida Blackletter">Our
Mission:</FONT></U></I></B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#00ff00" FACE="Lucida Blackletter">Our
Elf-Folk are to be the elite! We are to become the most powerful,
polite and helpful of all the elves of Norrath. Once again, only
united together can this be achieved. We must help each other
to become the best of the best. This, after all, is OUR guild,
and only together as a team can we make it work. If you feel this
is not for you, then we will respect that. You may depart without
remorse or guilt. Should you feel that this is where you wish
to be then WELCOME HOME.</FONT></B></CENTER>
