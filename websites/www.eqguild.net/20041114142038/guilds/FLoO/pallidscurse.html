<B><P>February 20, 2002 -- Pallidmortis' quest for the Ghoulbane</P>
</B><P> </P>
<P>This journey started a rainy night, as Pallidmortis wandered lost through the Western Plains of Karana. <BR>

<P>As he stumbled along the coastline, Pallidmortis saw a figure emerge on the horizon, it appeared to be a human male who was just staring blindly into the river. After evaluating that this Human was little threat to him, Pallidmortis approached him. "Hail Traveller, I am General Pallidmortis of the Foreign Legion of Odus, how fair you?" Pallidmortis announced. Ryshon Hunsti replied, 'Hello Pallidmortis. What brings you to the Karanas? Do you seek [enlightenment]? Pallidmortis chimed, "Of course I seek enlightenment." Ryshon Hunsti continued as if he were talking to some wayward ghost, "Ah! I could see by the look in your eyes that you are looking for something more than just enlightenment. Perhaps you are looking for a [sword] crafted by a noble man?" Pallidmortis pondered weather this man had any idea who he was, a vile Shadowknight of the Lord of Fear. However, this human had sparked Pallidmortis’ interest, and so he decided to follow this conversation to its end. Pallidmortis spoke, "I do seek the sword of a noble man, if I am worthy." Ryshon Hunsti beamed, "It is not just a sword friend. It is much more than that. This sword carries with it special [power], something unlike anything else within this realm." Pallidmortis’ full attention on the story replied, "What power does this blade hold?" Ryshon Hunsti reveiled, "It is an instrument fashioned together by noble man. It is said to be blessed by the gods themselves. Only a man who comes from nobility may wield it. Do you seek the [sword of nobility]?" Pallidmortis now knew he was in for a penny, in for a pound, so he proclaimed, "I seek the Sword of Nobility, as it is my birthright!" Ryshon Hunsti finished by saying, "I see, take this note then to Kanthuk Ogrebane. I've been told he can be found fishing not far from the dwarven city." Without another word, he stuffed the note into Pallidmortis’ hand and vanished without a trace. After his many journies, Pallidmortis decided this was worth more investigation, so he pulled out his compass he had forgotten he carried, and started his travels to the lands of the dwarves…the Butcherblock Mountains. <BR>

</P>
<P>After arriving through the mystical portals created by those who can travel the Plane of Knowledge, Pallidmortis stepped into the shadows so he may seek out this Kanthuk Ogrebane without the intruption of the dwarves. They had little love for Pallidmortis’ kind, and would gladly all get in line to jump on his blade and die if he would take the time to let them. In the interest of protecting the dwarves from becoming an endangered species, Pallidmortis thought this action best. After following the road to the docks, the shadow hidden knight past around the walls of the port following a north by northwest heading. Now free from the eyes of those who would seek their deaths, Pallidmortis stepped out of the shadows. Along the coast to the north, Pallidmortis saw this Kanthuk Ogrebane standing where Ryshon said he would be. After assessing the potential danger, Pallidmortis approached. Hail Kanthuk Ogrebane, I am Pallidmortis, son of the Noble Trebul Vanith of Erudin. Kanthuk Ogrebane replied simply with, "Hello." Pallidmortis then reached into his pouch, recovered the note within, then handed it to Kanthuk Ogrebane. Kanthuk Ogrebane’s eyes widened and he spoke, "Ah! I see you have spoke to Ryshon. You seem tired from your long journey. Sit with me as I tell you a tale. A tale about a true friend of mine, a great man known as [Amstaf Trunolis]." Pallidmortis was in a friendly mood, so he decided to entertain this crazy dwarf and listen to his tales. "Who is Amstaf Trunolis?" Pallidmortis asked. Kanthuk ogrebane started explaining, "Amstaf Trunolis was a good man. I've followed into [battle] many times. We've seen many of our friends die by the sword of others." Familiar with these times, Pallidmortis inquired," What battle?" Kanthuk Ogrebane laughes, "I remember the first time we charged into battle. I was so scared. My hands wouldn't stop trembling. Amstaf pulled me off to the side before the initial attack began. He held my hands within his. I saw his hands begin to glow and felt his energy pass into me. I felt [courage]." Thinking this nut was talking of a Paladin as if they were chosen of the Gods he said with a bit of sarcasim, "What courage?" Kanthuk Ogrebane not noticing it replied, "I'll never forget what he did for me that day. He gave me the courage to continue. No one's ever done anything like that for me. I vowed that day that I'd follow him into any battle. I'd be there alongside him, no matter what. As time went on we came across an elven woman named [Ambreen]." Pallidmortis having had his fair share of elvish women asked, "Who is Ambreen?" Kanthuk Ogrebane told Pallidmortis, "Ambreen was younger than he and I. She knew of the powers of nature. She was able to control the rain which fell from the heavens and would call upon the spirits to aide her. It was obvious that Amstaf took a liking to Ambreen. She ended up coming with is on out crusades. The last I saw of Ambreen was when we went to the snow covered lands of Everfrost. We were wander the lands when a freak [snowstorm] hit us. We were seperated from one another for quite some time." Thinking this whole tale was one, Pallidmortis said, "What snowstorm?" Kanthuk Ogrebane explained, "I don't know where it came from, but it was so sudden that it caught us all off guard. The snow quickly became unbearable. I tried to move to higher ground, but was unable to. I was stuck within the snowy confines. I didn't know what to do [next]." Pallidmortis continued, "What happened next?" Kanthuk Ogrebane told him, "As I laid there my body began to slowly freeze. I knew death was near and accepted the inevitable. Suddenly I felt something clutching at my cloak. I was being dragged upwards out of the snow. A hand pressed against my chest and began to glow. I felt energy pass into my body. Do you know [how] he had saved me?" Pallidmortis rolled his eyes and said, "How did he save you?" Kanthuk Ogrebane says, 'He saved my life by laying his hands upon my body. A few moments later we found Ambreen lying in the snow, her body frozen by the harsh surroundings. We lifted her up off the ground and began to look for [shelter]." Finally this old fool had a good idea, so Pallidmortis asked, "What shelter?" Kanthuk Ogrebane sounding half alive as it was told Pallidmortis, "We ended up taking refuge within a deserted cabin not to far from our location. We knew that we didn't have much time left to bring life back into her body. However, the storm didn't pass through and we knew we couldn't venture to far without the fear of freezing. I warmed the cabin and rested for some time thinking about what we were going to do. It wasn't long before my exhaustion took over. I fell into a deep [slumber] that night." Tyipical of a dwarf he said to himself, then said allowed, "What slumber?" Kanthuk Ogrebane said, "That night I dreamt of many things. Random thoughts kept swirling around my mind. I kept seeing the image of a cloaked being and of Amstaf circled around a fire. I saw Ambreen's body convulsing above the fire as if life was being brought back to it. I don't know what happened that night. I don't even know if what I dreamt was real, but before I awoke I saw a [strange image]." Knowing the image was induced by excessive drinking Pallidmortis mused forth, "What strange image?" Kanthuk Ogrebane gasped, "I saw Amstaf lower his head and walked away in silence. He was surronded by two beings carrying a torch. I don't know what it meant, but I swear it was so real. When I awoke both Amstaf and Ambreen were gone. Please find Llara and give this pendant to her. This pendant belonged to Amstaf. She too had a vision that night that may clear things up. If she asks where you got it from, mention my name." Again as had happened before, Kanthuk Ogrebane vanished after handing Pallidmortis the Pendant. A quick inspection of the pendant revieled that it was… <BR>

<P>Pallidmortis having spent what seemed to be an eternity listening to that crazy old dwarf decided it was time for some heads to roll. While on his way home, Pallidmortis stumbled upon a small goblin camp in the Butcherblock Mountains (Location Pos 1300 by Neg 1500). These goblins seemed to fight with a crazed possession, so he relished in the combat. While searching their corpses, Pallidmortis discovered something strange. It was the blade of a sword, and etched into the blade was the words, Blade of Nobility. Pallidmortis gasped in astonishment, the Human in the Karanas was telling the truth! More investigation was now warranted, so with a renewed vigor, Pallidmortis broke camp and headed for Dagnor’s Cauldron. <BR>

</P>
<P>As he approached the Estate of Unrest, just beyond Pallidmortis spotted a young human girl standing up on some perched rocks. He spied her for a moment to asses the risk, and decided to approach. "Hail young lady, I am Pallidmortis of Erudin, I believe this belongs to you." Pallidmortis handed her the amulet Kanthuk had given him. Llara said with glee, "Oh my! This belongs to Amstaf. Where did you get it?" He replied, "Kanthuk gave it to me." Llara almost reading his thoughts said, "I take it you're here to find out more about [Amstaf]." Pallidmortis asked, "Who was Amstaf?" Llara began to tell Pallidmortis, "I've known Amstaf since he was a child. We grew up in the same city together. Ever since I've known him there's always been something [unusual] about him." Wondering what this might be, "What was unusual?" Llara said, "When we were growing up we used to venture outside the city gates. Some times we would encounter a wandering ghoul or an undead spirit of some sort. He was always able to quickly dismiss the undead being with very little effort. I [learned] many things growing up with Amstaf." Thinking this feat nothing special Pallidmortis inquired, "What did you learn?" Llara continued, "Amstaf told me many things when we were younger. Once Amstaf told me that life isn't about how you get there, it's about where you end up. I miss my dear friend. Its been a long time since I've seen him. The night of the snowstorm I dreamt about him. I remember seeing Amstaf's face. I saw something I've never [seen] before." Curious and sick to his stomach at the same time, Pallidmortis asked, "What did you see?" Llara spoke, "I saw desperation. I spoke to many people who knew Amstaf trying to find out if anyone heard anything about that night. No one knew anything about it. When I had reached the dwarven hunting grounds I ran into a woman named Walnan. She kept rambling on and on about the power of the Orb and something about Magi`kot. I didn't understand what she was saying. She didn't know anything about my situation either, but she did tell me that there were others that may be able to help me. She told me that I should find [Ruathey]." Pallidmortis asked, "Who is Ruathey?" Llara reveield, "Ruathey is known for her ability to look into people's souls and find truth. Though I wasn't able to find Amstaf, I was able to recover his sword. I believe that by having his sword I am closer to finding him. Take this note to Ruathey and tell her that I sent you." Yet again, Pallidmortis received the note only to see the person vanish before him. Something was strange, but Pallidmortis was determined to uncover the truth. He went inside the Estate of Unrest for some hunting before beginning his search for this Ruathey. <BR>

<P>Inside the mansion Pallidmortis fought tooth and nail with all manor of rotting beings. Festering Hags, Undead Nobles and anything else you could imagine. There was one monstrosity that Pallidmortis found most interesting, ghouls. Not your average, run of the mill ghoul, but ghouls that were crazed beyond belief. They seemed tortured because they were caught between life and undeath. These ghouls seemed bent on tasting the warm blood that coursed through the veins of Pallidmortis, as if it could give them their long forgotten lives back. After many hard fought battles, Pallidmortis trust his hand into the now cold flesh of a crazed ghoul and wretched forth its heart. Somehow, the blade in his bag seemed to be drawn to the heart, so Pallidmortis placed it in his bag for further investigation. Now tired and weary, Pallidmortis decided to head to Neriak and take in some elvish wine and women. After a days rest, Pallidmortis set out on his journey to discover the truth behind this Amstaf. His next destination was the lair of Lady Najena. The Widowmistress and Pallidmortis had something of a score to settle, so this would make for some fun. Low and behold as Pallidmortis rounded the first bend in the Lavastorm Mountains on his way to Najena, he saw this Ruathey standing by a tree. <BR>
</P>

</P>
<P>He approached her. "Hail Ruathey, if you are who you are suppost to be, you certainly knew of my coming, take this." Pallidmortis said as he handed her the note. Ruathey snarled, "I see that you've spoken to Llara. She too came to me looking for Amstaf. Though she wasn't able to find her friend, she was able to recover his [sword]." Here we go again Pallidmortis thought before he said, "What sword?" Ruathey continued, "I've heard stories about a holy sword. There are many rumored to be hidden all throughout the world, yet only a few have actually been found. Amstaf had one of these swords. It is known for its ability to dismiss the undead. Perhaps by having this sword it'll bring you closer to finding your friend. Gather a ghoul's heart, Amstaf's Scroll, the Blade of Nobility, a noblemans hilt and place them in this [bag]." Pallidmortis asked, "What bag?" Ruathey replied, "Take this bag and gather the items I've mentioned. I've been told that the Ghoul's Heart can be found in the estate of the undead, while the scroll can be found in the Keep not far from the Karanas. One of the others are rumored to be found near the dwarven city among the goblins. While the last should be found in the caverns of Najena." And as expected, Ruathey vanished after handing Pallidmortis the bag. But finally the truth had been reveiled, and Pallidmortis would find this blade and use it for his own dark ends. His next stop was to Najena, to find this other item, and to settle his business there. <BR>

</P>
<P>While on his trek to the lair of the Widowmistress, Pallidmortis was attacked by A_Skeleton. Several of them attempted to best him, but in the end only found permanate death. Pallidmortis checked their corpses for bone chips he could use in his dark arts, and to his amazement, he found something he wanted even more, the Hilt of Nobility. Alas, he now had three of the four parts he needed to obtain this Holy Relic so that he may defile it. Forgetting that the Widowmistress was waiting for Pallidmortis’ warm embrace before her death, he ran off to the Keep in the Karanas. <BR>

</P>
<P>Again, Pallidmortis stepped into the shadows to avoid any hassles, and delved deep into the heart of the Keep’s basement. It was here that he killed Goblin Theives and Crazed Goblins until he found the bounty he had been seeking. It was several hours before luck would come Pallidmortis’ way, but alas it did. The scroll was hidden in the pocket of a Crazed Goblin, and now it was in the hands of Pallidmortis. Pallidmortis quickly withdrew the Heart of the Ghoul, the Blade of Nobility, the Hilt of Nobility, and Amstaf’s Scroll. He then placed them all in the bag Ruathey had given him. The bag glowed brightly, nearly blinding Pallidmortis’ evil eyes, but when the light dimmed, lay before him on the floor was the Sword of Nobility…the GhoulBane! It would only be a matter of time Pallidmortis thought to himself, and this blade will serve me as its master.</P><DIR>
