The Ry'Gorr Chief <br>
 <br>
The Ry'Gorr Chief (the guys who drops the chest piece of the set) is a nasty nasty critter. Here is an account of the one time I helped kill him...<Br>
<br>
We had a small group camping the front of the fort in EW. Myself (40th chanter), my friend Raghnall (39th Warrior), a great 40th cleric from Unity of Light and a nervous 35th level monk. After a little while of us killing legionaires and centurions a level 60 Shadow Knight in full Kael armour, pre-nerf Mask of the Deceiver and his Epic comes along and asks if he can pull some orcs. We say sure, there are plenty of orcs to go around. So we continue fighting as the SK pulls Elites - very likely farming pieces of Ry'Gorr armour.<Br>
<br>
A lonesome level 50 Wizard joins our group to have a change from his endless soloing and so we proceed to pull some Elites as well. With his nukes we could easily handle the Elite Ry'Gorr Orcs and our group got a bracer and some gauntlets.<Br>
<br>
Now for the fun part: The SK pulls the Chief to finish off his set of Ry'Gorr whilst we pull a mystic and a legionaire. I mez the legionaire and the group kills the mystic with a few quick blasts from our wizard.<Br>
<Br>
The next thing we see is our cleric go from full health to dead in a couple of seconds. I look across to see the Level 60 SK laid out dead on the ground and the Chief standing above the corpse of our cleric. The Chief is on about half health and charges towards the rest of us.<br>
<br>
Raghnall jumps in to get the Chiefs attention, I Tash and manage to land a slow and the Wizard snares it with Bonds of Force. All is going well until I see "OOM" from our level 50 wizard. The wizard sits down to med and the Chief ignores the dwarven warrior to charge across and lay a flurry of blows on the sitting wizard. Raghnall manages to taunt him off and I manage to land a root after about 3 attempts. At this stage both Raggy and the wizard are getting low on health and the Chief seems to have taken hardly any more damage. Raghnall calls out that the Chief is double attacking for 174 and then mez breaks on the legionaire. <br>
<br>
A quick charm on the legionaire tips the odds back in our favour and the Chief and my new pet start to slug it out whilst Raghnall pulls out his bow to fire on the rooted Chief from a safe distance. Our monk jumps in and promptly gets badly torn up and FDs. The legionaire manages to get the Chief down to about 25% before it dies (showing just how many HPs even weak Velious mobs have). <br>
<Br>
Root then breaks and Raghnall reengages with me chain casting Rune III to try and keep him alive. Just as things are looking very grim the wizard stands back up and opens fire with all manner of magical death ... half of the spells seem to be resisted but enough get through to fell the creature. As he neared death the Chief tried to run back towards the gates of the fort, calling for help, but a quick root kept him from fleeing (and possibly spawning those Avengers you hear people talk about).<br>
<br>
So the reason that the very nice Ry'Gorr chest piece is so expensive is because the Chief is a nasty, nasty critter...
