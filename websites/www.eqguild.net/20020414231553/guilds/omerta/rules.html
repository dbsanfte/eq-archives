       	<b>What we expect in our players</b><br>
       	Omerta is in search of players with a good attitude and the ability to work well in a team. No one is expected to know every aspect of EQ prior to joining, but a good grasp of the game, skill at playing one's chosen class, and the desire to improve are all needed. We look for players will to help improve the guild first, not use the guild only as a means of improving themselves. <br><br>
       
       This is a guild with plan's to take on the toughest encounters, to tackle some of EQ's biggest challenges, but this is not an easy road to take. If dying (many times) or failing are things you don't deal with well, this is probably not the right guild. Every guild at the top of the game has reached their ability through lots of failures and trying things, this guild will be no different.<br><br>
       
       If the primary reason you play Everquest is loot, this is probably not the right guild for you. We will equip our players to the best of our ability to meet our challenges, but this is not the guild's primary focus. Loot comes in time, but will not be handed on silver platter simply for joining.

       Finally it is expected that the applicant has read and understood everything on this page. Please feel free to contact an officer for any clarification you may need.

       	<b>What you can expect from the guild</b><br>
       	The basic premise of this guild is to grow together as a team, gear towards ever more difficult goals and objectives, and having a good time doing it. You can expect to be in a guild striving to improve itself, trying new things, not giving up or stagnating after a failure. You may also expect that every single player wearing the <Omerta> guild tag is held to the same standards as you are, including the guild officers and leader. Finally you may expect that you always have a means of communication to the people who make the decisions in the guild, both in-game and via the forums. Not everyone's suggestions will be acted on all the time, but no one will be ignored. 
       <br><hr noshade color="#000000">
       <b>Leadership</b><br>
       The final say in decisions is made by the guild leader, Reakwon. The guild leader will be in consultation with the guild officers on most decisions, as well as the input of the guild members from the forums and guild meetings.
       <br><br>
       The officers have been elected based on their contribution to the guild, their understanding of the game, and their ability to deal with people. As the guild grows, officers with more specialized roles may be appointed.
       <br><br>
The guild structure is in the form of a council of elders, which represent the needs and requirements of each and every member of Omerta. When decisions are to be made, the council will vote in order to discuss an appropriate course of action, the results of which will be passed on to guild members as deemed appropriate.
       <br><br>
       The guild officers will be there to listen to the members be it suggestions, praise, or complaint as to how the guild is being operated, and communicate this to the other officers and guild leader as part of the decision making process. 
       <br><hr noshade color="#000000">
       <b>Rules</b><br>
       Every member is expected to act with respect to fellow guild members, officers, members of other guilds, and the rest of the server. This doesn't mean people can't disagree, but personal attacks, rudeness, threats, and poor behaviour will not be tolerated. If a personal dispute arises between any two members, they should make all efforts to work things out privately. If this is not possible they should contact an officer to help resolve the dispute. Public attacks on the server or message boards will not be tolerated. Basically: don't make an ass of yourself or the guild, and treat everyone with respect. 
       <br><br>
       The forums on this website will be the guild's primary means of communication, please check them regularly.
       <br><br>
       Guild chat should be kept relatively clean of profanity.
       <br><br>
       Ebaying items the guild helped obtain will result in immediate guild removal, this goes for services similar to Ebay as well. 
       <br><br>
       The password to the private forums may not be given to any non-guild member, nor may things discussed within be disclosed to non-guild members unless otherwise noted.
       <br><br>
       You may not be a member of any other guild on Xev, this goes for other characters on your account as well. <br><hr noshade color="#000000">
       <b>Loot Rules</b><br>
       Omerta operates on a system of allocated loot by the raid leader based on the following factors:<BR><br>
       <LI><i>Participation</i>: The primary consideration will be participation in the guild. This includes helping on raids where you know beforehand there will probably be no rewards for your particular class. Selectively only participating in raids that you may somehow benefit from will not be rewarded. This aspect won't be completely arbitrary, a database tracking participation based on many different factors is at work behind the scenes, though the exact workings of the system are not up for discretion.
       <LI><i>Class Use</i>: Many items are useable by more than one class, and may be useful to multiple classes, the raid leader will decide which class to award an item to.
       <LI><i>Needs of the Guild</i>: There may be times when a certain member having a certain item or spell is crucial to the guild being able to accomplish other encounters.
       <LI><i>Type of character</i>: If you have more than one guilded character, primary characters will take priority over alts (i.e. its very unlikely your alt will get a piece of loot someone else's main still needs).
       <LI><I>Non-guild Invites</i>: Non guild members who have been invited along on a raid may occasionally be awarded loot, but are after members on the priority list. The person inviting them should make them aware of this beforehand.
       <LI><i>Most important rule</i>: There may be times when you may feel an item was given to the incorrect person, incorrect class, there was someone more deserving, or for whatever reason the loot was handled wrong. If you feel the problem was serious or re-occuring please contact an officer privately to discuss the issue afterwards, arguments during raids over loot are very much against what this guild is about. Not everyone will always agree on loot allocation, but in the long run if you participate in this guild you will be rewarded.
       <br><hr noshade color="#000000">
       <b>The Omerta Vault</b><br>
       The guild bank will have two components. The first is a simple forum where guild members, purely at their option, may make things they have they no longer need available to other guild members.
       <br><br>
       The second component is a guild vault administered by the guild leader. This is where funds for raids, guild events and other things come from. This vault will consist of cash items found on raids, monster-dropped spells that aren't awarded to anyone specific on the raid, gems, velious armor quest gems, tradeable items for whatever reason not awarded to anyone on a raid. The actual bank will reside on one or several mules in Greater Faydark at the Kelethin bank controlled by the guild leader. Items will be appropriated to certain people from the bank from time to time by the guild leader, or may be sold for cash to non-guild members to fund guild activities. 
       <br><br>
       Certain tradeable items on raids, or items awarded to people from the guild bank, remain property of the guild. This means when you no longer need them and/or have upgraded them, they will be passed on to someone else in the guild who needs them. Items of this type will be flagged as such when they are rewarded. The idea behind this is after a while, one piece of loot being awarded may benefit several other members indirectly through hand-me-downs.
       <br><br>
       The guild bank is there to fund guild activities and raids, and better the guild. It is not a place you go to ask to borrow money to go buy some item you want. Also if an item exists in the bank that you feel you could use, understand that it may be appropriated to you, but you do not have automatic rights to any item just because its there.
       <br><br>

       <b>Summary</b><BR>
       The rules may seem long and tedious, but they are here and available for everyone to read so everyone knows what to expect and not to expect. They may added to and modified as is needed in the future. The theme underlying every rule is simple really: play nice, respect others, don't worry too much about what loot you're getting and when, have fun and there should be little or no problems. 
       
       If you have any questions, please feel free to contact an officer for clarification.
