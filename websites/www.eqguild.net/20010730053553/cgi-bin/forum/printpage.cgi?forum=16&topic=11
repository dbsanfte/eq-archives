        I think if you have someone take a screenshot of you, that would work. &nbsp;you might have to convert the format though, i think they are bitmaps.

        I was thinking of editing all the background out of a screen shot so just a picture of the character. &nbsp;What format does it need to be in? &nbsp;JPG?
