        *coddles the poor lost puppy soul* &nbsp;Awww, cutie, I can't grant you access. &nbsp;Opalecia will have to do that when she gets back online. &nbsp;We haven't seen much of her recently and hope she's doing okay and things are looking up for her... <br> <br>Hang in there until we can get your access granted...I'm sorry my hands are pretty much tied. &nbsp;:(  <br>

        Okay, going to start a new thread for those specifically needing access to the forums. <br> <br>That should make it easier for Opalecia to sort out. <br> <br>Hang in there until we get it fixed :) <br>

        Hello Kristianie, <br> <br>How are you? &nbsp;Still looking for a guild. &nbsp;I've hadn't any luck thus far. &nbsp;Someone from the New OutRaiders wanting me to be a recruiter though. &nbsp;I don't know if they are any fun though. &nbsp;So far they don't have a very good sence of humor. &nbsp;Well gotta go. <br> <br>HOWWWWL YA LATER!
