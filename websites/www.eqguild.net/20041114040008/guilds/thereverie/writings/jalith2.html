Ode to a Meditation

<br><br><br>
 
I port over to Nektulos Forest and run to Lavastorm Mountains.  I then proceed to find a tall mountain overlooking a small lavaflow.  I cast a small spell to allow me to sit in relative comfort as I work.  I sit down and pull out my spellbook.  I begin reading over all my spells and try to decide what I would like to commit to my memory.  As I read on, my thoughts begin to wander to all my friends (like a Dark Elf has many friends.)  I wonder what part of Norrath they are holed up in trying to find that ever elusive "object of desire" that they are searching for.  But I digress, I should be studying right now.  I clear my thoughts with this ditty.<br><br>
 
I pray to the power of fire.<br>
Fire to cook, fire to clean,<br>
Fire to cleanse, fire to burn.<br>
I pray to honor the Burning Prince.<br>
I pray to the power of Solusek Ro.<br>
Use thy fire to cleanse my heart<br>
Use thy fire to purify my thoughts<br>
Use thy fire to light my pathways<br>
Impart on me thy fire so that I may show the world your power<br>
Impart on me thy fire so that I may impart to you the souls of your enemies<br>
Impart on me thy fire so that through me the world can burn in your glory<br>
My prayer burns in my heart always<br><br>
 
I then bend to my studies, with my heart (and eyes) aglow with power and fire.  I gain new insights to my spells and how to use them effectively and to smite my enemies.  <br><br>
 
Be aware, the world will burn with the glory of Solusek Ro, the Burning Prince!  The Sun itself proclaims his glory!!<br><br><br>
