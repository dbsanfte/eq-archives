        Hey all, for everyone unaware, Artic has been working with Annadryl from Silent Blades of Norrath in order to create an alliance with their fine guild. &nbsp;If you see any of their members in game, please don't be shy about introducing yourself formally. <br> <br>Since it looks as thought their minimum level is level 20, we should be able to group with them fairly easily since most of our guild consists of post-20th level players. <br> <br>
