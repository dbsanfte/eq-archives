<b>What Endless Spirits is about:</b><br>
<blockquote>
Endless Spirits is about providing a community.  A community that helps one another so that we can all accomplish great things.  
<br><br>
Through the strength of our community we will accomplish things that we cannot accomplish on our own.
<br><br>
We are friends, we are explorers, we are bad ass players :)
<br><br>
If you would like to join us please leave a post on our membership requests forum.
<br><br>
All races and classes are welcome.

<b>Rules:</b>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>In all things, use common sense.  If that fails, use more common sense.</li>
  <li>Have respect for others.</li>
  <li>Listen to your fellow guild mates and your group members.</li>
  <li>The guild does not power level or twink players.  If an individual wishes to do this, it is their personal choice and it does not reflect the actions of the guild, but of that individual.  Do not expect this of anyone, and if someone does choose to help you please remember to be grateful for their assistance.</li>
  <li>If you are looking to get an item do not expect someone to get it for you.  But you may request the assistance of the guild in getting something as long as you have the ability to participate in getting that item.</li>
  <li>Alts: While it is not required, it is encouraged that your alts be members of the guild.  The reason for this is that it helps maintain our ability to communicate with all of our members.</li>
  <li>You are required to keep your guild magic character registration up to date.</li>
  <li>Raids: Please see the separate area for information about raids.</li>
  <li>And let's not forget the most important rule.  HAVE FUN.  It is a game after all!</li>
</ul>
