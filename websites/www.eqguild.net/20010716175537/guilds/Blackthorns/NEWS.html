Saturday June 9th: Guild up and running, :) we need a place and day each week for guild meetings, e-mail suggestions to me please. working on a message board but it will be a bit before it is ready. <br><br><br><br><br>

Saturday June 9th, 7PM PST we will be meeting in neriak third gate to gather for a head count by the guides, this could take some time so be prepared to sit an hour or more. <br><br><br><br><br>

The guild was approved on Wednesday June 6th. Now we need 10 folks online with nothing but time to sit talk and wait for a guide to do the headcount. When can we do this?<br><br><br><br>
