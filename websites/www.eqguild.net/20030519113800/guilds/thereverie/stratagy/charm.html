BASIC CHARM SPELL INFORMATION<br>
<br>
Firstly some info about Charm spells. Enchanter charm spells are generic and can effect a wide variety of creatures whereas the charm spells of other classes are specific to certain types of creatures. For example Druids have spells to Charm Animals or Charm Plants whereas Necromancers have spells to Charm Undead. Bards have Charm Songs that are like Enchanter charm spells in that they can effect most anything but are peculiar (like most things bardic) and last for 18 seconds. All other Charm spells have a variable duration with a maximum of about 8 minutes.
<br><br>
Given that the target of your Charm spell is appropriate there is still the matter of creature level to consider. Each spell will only effect creatures up to a certain level. For example the Enchanter 24th level spell Beguile will only work on creatures up to 39th level, the Druid 34th level spell Beguile Animal will work on animal type creatures up to 44th level.
<br>
<br>
RESISTANCE<br>
<br>
Charm spells work against a creature’s Magic Resistance. So good choices for potential pets are ones which are not notably resistant. Use of MR debuffs like the Enchanter Tashan line are highly recommended. I Tash everything I intend to Charm even if it is very green to me. A creature can resist charm in two ways – it can resist the initial spell outright or more likely it can succeed at a check to break the charm sometime after the spell initially takes hold. It seems that a creature gets to make these checks every tick and this results in Charm spells having their unpredictable duration. Using a MR debuff seems to greatly reduce the chance of a creature breaking charm early.<br>
<br>

CHARISMA
<br><br>
The character statistic that has the most impact on Charm spells is Charisma. Both the Bard and Enchanter community seem to believe that a high Charisma has a noticeable impact on Charm duration. The Enchanter community does seem to turn into a collection of deranged statisticians when the subject of Charisma’s effect on the Mesmerise line of spells is raised however :)<br>
<br>
Some good Charisma gear is worthwhile if you want to make use of Charm spells and both Enchanters and Shamans have Charisma buffs which I highly recommend. When charming I can get my Charisma to just over 200 and very often have my Charms last so long I actively break them myself so I can kill my former pet before it regenerates too much of it’s health. I have heard that Necromancers achieve better results from having lower Charisma statistics (with a negative Charisma score being the ideal) but don’t know if this is the case having never played a necromancer.
<br><br>

BREAKING CHARM YOURSELF<br><br>

If you do want to break a charm early you can either turn yourself invisible (which automatically breaks the Charm spell) or you can use a buff stripping spell like Nullify Magic or Strip Enchantment. The former method has the advantage of not stripping off other spell effects you want to stay on your former pet (such as Snare) whilst the later is preferable if you have buffed your pet with something you’d rather it didn’t keep (such as haste spells). The spells Invisibility and Camouflage as well as the Hide skill all work to break charm.
<br>
<br>
PET COMMANDS<br>
<Br>
Charmed Pets respond to the usual pet commands used by the likes of magicians and necromancers. The commands I have made up as social buttons are:<br>
<Br>
/pet attack – this tells your pet to attack your selected target
<Br><br>
/pet back off – this tells your pet to stop attacking the creature it is engaged with. You may need to spam button to get this to work since your pet will re-engage as soon as it gets hit.<br>
<Br>
/pet guard here – this tells the pet to stand where it is even if you wander away. This is useful to put some distance between yourself and your pet when you are going to break charm.
<Br><br>
The /pet get lost command which pet classes use to destroy a pet will NOT work on a charmed pet – it will ignore it. Also the /pet sit down command can have unpredictable results … sometimes the pet will just wander off. If you want to order the pet to stand it’s ground /pet guard here is a better option. For additional /pet commands speak to your local magician or necromancer :)
<Br>
<br>
PECULIARITIES<Br>
<br>
Some charmed pets will refuse to attack others of their own kind. The first time I encountered this was with the Gnolls in High Pass. I ordered a freshly charmed Gnoll Shaman to attack another Gnoll and it responded with something like “That is not a legal target master”. However when the uncharmed gnoll took offence to my presence and started swinging my pet leapt to my defence anyway. 
<br>
<br>
PREPARING YOURSELF<br>
<br>
It is a very good idea to have SOW cast upon yourself before you begin. This will allow you to manoeuvre for distance if you need to recharm a pet mid-fight or if necessary flee to a zone line. Since a formerly charmed pet will be extremely upset with you it is a good idea to load on the Hit Point, AC and damage skin buffs before you start. Having a heal spell or damage skin memorised so you can cast in the heat of battle is also a good idea. Fighting near a zone line in case you need to flee is a good idea if possible.<br>
<br>
Enchanters have numerous stun and mez spells that can be used to buy time to recharm a pet or gate away if things go really bad and should keep these memorised.<br>
<br>
Druids should always use Snare on a potential pet before they Charm it. This will make recharming a pet simply a matter of backing off far enough to cast charm whilst the poor thing crawls towards you.<br>
<br>
ALWAYS have a Root spell memorised when charming. <Br>
<br>

CHARM FIGHTING<br>
<br>
The idea behind charm fighting is to make a creature your pet and have it only just defeat another creature or series of creatures. Thus when charm breaks after the fight your former pet will be so weakened as to be an easy kill. You do not want your pet to lose it’s fight as this will result in it’s corpse vanishing and you missing out on the experience for killing it. You also want to kill the target whilst your pet is still charmed, otherwise you can miss out on the experience for the kill since damage is assigned to an NPC - similar to when a guard steals your kill.<br>
<br>
To ensure that your pet defeats it’s opponents you can either debuff the opponent, buff the pet or nuke the opponent or a use a combination of these. <br>
<br>
Be aware that you can only cast hindering spells like Snare on an Uncharmed creature and conversely you can only cast beneficial spells like Damage Shields on a Charmed creature. So you have to make sure you cast the spells you want on your charmed pet in the correct order.<br>
<br>

DEBUFFING THE OPPONENT<br>
<br>
Very soon after ordering your pet in against another creature be sure to Root the target creature and keep it rooted throughout the entire fight. This will mean that if your pet does break charm you only have to deal with it when you attempt to regain control. Otherwise you could end up trying to recharm with two angry creatures beating on you. Other debuffs can be cast on the target, such as slow spells, but these can have the effect of prolonging the fight and thus increasing the likelyhood of Charm breaking before the opponent has been slain.
<br>
<br>
BUFFING THE CHARMED PET<br>
<br>
This is a careful balance between making your pet strong enough to win it’s fights but not so strong that you can’t control it once charm breaks. Haste spells like Alacrity can give you a pet that dishes out very large amounts of damage but also one that swings so fast that you can’t get a spell off between swings. This can result in you suffering a messy death at the claws of a former pet. In some cases though a hasted pet is just too powerful to resist using :) <br>
<br>
Druids have the option of using a damage shield on their pet. This is quite a good option since once charm breaks they are most unlikely to be trying to beat the former pet to death with a stick but instead will be root dotting or kiting it from a distance.<br>
<br>
Using heals or Hit Point/AC buffs on a charmed pet is a bad idea as these will prolong the fight (increasing the chance of charm breaking) and/or make the former pet more difficult to kill after it has defeated it’s opponent.<br>
<Br>

NUKING THE TARGET<br>
<br>
If you have the mana to spare this is probably the best way to ensure that your pet wins the fight. Be careful to manage the aggro so that the target doesn’t switch to attack you. This is another reason to keep the target rooted at all times so that it has no option but to swing at your charmed pet. Nuking is preferable to the other methods since it shortens the fight but doesn’t leave you with a buffed former pet that will be difficult to manage.<br>
<br>
DOTing the target is another possibility but one that doesn’t give you as much of an opportunity to finely judge the damage you do. A powerful DOT could allow your pet to win too easily making it harder to kill when charm is broken. A dotted target will also break mez every tick when it takes damage – using a DOT removes mez as an option for an enchanter if things go badly (charm and root breaking at the same time for example).
<br>
<br>
I hope this little essay has proved informative. Charming is a very handy tactic to know – it can be effective and a great deal of fun. Never knowing just what might happen makes every attempt at charming something of an adventure :)
