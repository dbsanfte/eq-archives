             <blockquote> 
               <p>The goal is to quickly kill Trak before the poison kills your 
                 raid. Trak can be done with 20 level 60 players or 30+ level 55+ 
                 players. I try to set up groups like so, two tanks, one bard, 
                 two clerics, one pally in the MT group, same thing in the second 
                 group. Everyone else fends for themselves with balanced groups. 
               </p>
               <p>The most common way to pull trak. Have a monk in the lair to 
                 pull, have a second monk in the cave to tag the pull. When Trak/Protectors 
                 are in the back, first monk single pulls Juggs to the bridge then 
                 FDs. If the pull is good as in no Trak/Prot together then have 
                 the second monk finish the pull to camp. In the end you should 
                 get the Protector single into the cave. If you do get trak in 
                 the cave then kill him quick as he will gate. </p>
               <p>Lastly when you're done pulling the Sebelite Juggernaughts between 
                 Trak and the cave you rush Trak. Send in the first two groups 
                 then everyone else a few seconds behind. Have melee use offensive 
                 disc at 70%, chain nuke at 50%. The trick is finish off trak quickly 
                 - do not send in waves as that tactic just gives his poison dot 
                 that much more time to do damage. <br>

Clear all the Juggernauts around him, including the ones in his lair. Our puller did this without aggroing Trakanon, so it can be done. Tolapumj was left until after we finished Trak off. 

<p>The first wave of people we sent in were somewhat of sacrifices. We sent in a chanter to Tash him, a druid to dispell, and a shadowknight to center him in his lair. Positioning trak in the middle of his lair is important so that Tolapumj does not add during the fight. This first wave was sent in for the above reasons, as well as to take the first wave of his AE. 

<p>Yes, Trakanon does banish people out of his lair, not sure where, but expect to have to corpse summon those who are banished after the fight. He also blinds, but it doesn't appear to be AoE. I was within his AE range during the entire (short) fight, and I was never blinded. 

<p>After the first wave of AE was triggered, we then sent in the melee and clerics to start working Trak over. Casters stayed behind at this point. After Traks second round of AE (the tanks established aggro during this time), the casters came in and started to nuke Trak down, dumping as much mana as possible at that time. He has only 32k hp, so it's not a long fight. 

<p>His Poision AE does about 1500 damage a pop, and his dot sucks. More people died after the fight than during. Clerics may want to keep abolish poision memmed as well as Word of Vigor for curing poison. One shot of abolish poison cured targets I was able to save. 

<p>Other than the positiong of Trak and sending in the three waves mentioned above, standard Naggy tactics apply.
