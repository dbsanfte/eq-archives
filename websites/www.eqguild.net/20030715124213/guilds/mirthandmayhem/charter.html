<br /> <p><i>Note: Our charter is always a work in progress and will be updated as needed to serve the needs of the membership and to help the guild function more smoothly.</i>

<br /><br /><b>Who we are and what we hope to accomplish:</b>
<p>Join us in building something that we hope will be great and wonderful!   Mirth and Mayhem!</p>

<p>One of the main goals of the Ring of Mirth and Mayhem is to have FUN  and to give our members a place to call home. We hope to become a circle of friendly faces with whom we can share the joys, as well as the trials and tribulations, of  adventuring throughout Norrath, Luclin and beyond!</p>

<p>Members of the Ring of Mirth and Mayhem should be people that YOU  would want to game with! We believe a good start is with honorable people who are not afraid to be thought of as caring and giving but who demonstrate dedication, bravery, and honesty and are also known for their loyalty and competence in battle!</p>

<p>We are founded on a spirit of sharing.</p>

<p>We hope that each of you will share with each other your knowledge of zones,  mobs, tradeskills, weapons, strategies and other hints and tips you have gleaned from your travels so that  your guild family  can get the most enjoyment out of their adventures!</p>

<p>If a guild member asks for help and you are in a position to do so, please  don't hesitate.  But if you ask for assistance, know that
it is not always possible, for whatever reasons, for someone to drop what they  are doing to assist. </p> 

<p>If you are able to extend the spirit of sharing down to assisting other members with the passing down of your old gear to other members  the Gods and Goddesses of Norrath will smile favorably upon you, but  again we recognize the need to sell old gear for
upgrades of our own is often necessary.</p>

<p>We encourage members to exemplify kindness and not to be oblivious or  to others outside of our guild......a kind word, a spare buff, or a small item can sometimes change the outlook of the entire day for a stranger.  And that stranger may be grouped
beside you in a tight situation next week and may even be wearing our guild tag someday!</p>


<p>We hope that our family will grow and prosper and eventually be in a  position assist each other and even other guilds to raid those zones where we can obtain the gear needed to get stronger and even strong enough for those of us who are interested to
be able to attain our epics!</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="oproc"><b>Operational Procedures</b></a>
<br /></p>

<p> <b>Membership</b> <br />
We will temporarily close new applications when we reach 75 members.  This is it facilitate becoming a closer group by getting to know each other and being able to more effectively assist when we can. 

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Minimum  Level</b> <br /></font>
20 for main characters, with occasion exceptions for friends and restarted characters.  No minimum level for alts/secondary characters  of current members.
<a name="afm">
<p> <b>Applying for Membership</b> <br /></a>
Interested parties, with main characters level 20 or above that they wish to have apply to Ring, must read and agree with the charter. Potential members then must
complete the <a href="application.html">online application</a> 
<br><br> Acceptance into Ring is at the discretion of the leadership.  Personal knowledge/friendship with Ring of Mirth and Mayhem members is favorable when considering applicants for acceptance.  We strive to have a "family" feeling to our guild.

<p> <b>Minimum  Level</b> <br />
20 for main characters, with occasion exceptions for friends and restarted characters.  No minimum level for alts of current members.

<p> <b>Trial Membership</b><br />
New members will have trial period of one month before they are considered  full members. After one month a vote will be taken among the officers and the person  advised of the result.  If any guild member has a serious problem with a prospective member during their trial month, they should advise an officer or officers immediately. </p>

<p> <b>Sponsorship  
</b><br /> Members are encouraged to sponsor their friends and companions as new members and recommend them for guild membership.  Members should only sponsor those they know and believe to be a good fit for the guild,  Sponsored members  only need to undergo a two week trial period, but the member sponsoring the new member is expected to help insure the new member understands the guild etc. </p>

<a name="idg">
<p> <b>Involuntary De-Guilding/Removal</b><br /></a>
In the event removal of a member from Ring of Mirth and Mayhem is necessitated, the removal of a member must be done by vote of at least 3 officers, after reviewing the situation and after speaking to all  parties involved. An email with the details of the circumstances leading to the removal will be sent to the guild leaders within 24 hours.  Removed members are also encouraged to send an email to the guild leaders. </p>

<a name="vdg">
<p> <b>Voluntary De-Guilding</b><br />
Leaving Ring of Mirth and Mayhem is a serious matter that should be fully considered before doing so.  Each member made a commitment to the guild and the other members when they joined.  When members leave the guild, it makes life more difficult for their friends and Guildmates and makes it more difficult for Ring members to attain their goals.  A decision to remove oneself from Ring should be carefully thought out and if needed discussed with one of the guild leaders or an officer.  Please do not leave the Guild if you are angry or upset with someone -- seek out one of the guild leaders or an officer and talk it out. Most problems can be resolved if we KNOW about them! <br><br   In the event of a member leaving the guild and later requesting readmission, the decision to re-guild is will be at the discretion of the guild leaders.  If a member leaves the guild a second time, they will not be readmitted.. </p>



<p> <b>Guild Chat</b><br />Please keep it FAIRLY clean, others may be more sensitive to swear words than you are. Also, while we CONSIDER all of our members to be adult, remember that not all of our members may be over 21!!  Be respectful of each other in all ways and please do not have arguments in guild chat, take it private. 
<br /> <br /> Also, please refrain from using sexist, ageist, racist or other derogatory language in guild chat or at guild functions. Again, please be sensitive to others.
<a name="ra">
<p> <b>Raid Attendance</b><br /></a>

Attendance at Raids when your character is of an appropiate level and you are able to be online for the entire raid is suggested to further your own goals as well as  the goals of fellow guildmates.  Eventually we will ALL need the consideration and assistance of our guildmates to advance.
<br /><br />
However, in consideration of personal issues such as work, school, and family, attendance at Raids is NOT mandatory.
<br /><br />
Please sign up in advance for Raids which you can attend so that appropriate plans can be made. If you sign up and subsequently cannot attend a raid, please do your best to let the Raid Leader know or send an email to the guild email address with your regrets.


 </p>
<a name="re">
<p> <b>Raid Ettiquette</b></a><br />
Please be on time for Raids
<br /><br />
Please be PATIENT on Raids.  Things often take time to coordinate at the beginning.  Chat with friends, practice tradeskills, get buffs etc, and wait for group assignments.
<br /><br />
Bring enough food and drink for an extended stay
<br /><br />
Casters please bring enough spell components for use on multiple people in a raid (if you are casting a buff that requires a gem, like Temperance, the guild treasury will reimburse you for what you use.)
<br /><br />
Rangers, Warriors, Pallys etc. please stock up on arrows before a raid in case you are called upon to pull or are otherwise in a situation where use of a bow would be appropriate.
<br /><br />
Please try to minimize your need to be AFK during a raid --- sometimes being away can be very dangerous!
</p> 
<p> <b>Dues</b><br />
No dues are required.  However, members encouraged to contribute to the treasury if they find themselves in a position to do so. Monies collected in the treasury will be used to fund guild outings (prizes), pay for the reagents for spells used by guild members on raids, to help members advance their tradeskills etc. 
</p>
<p> <b>Treasury</b><br />
The Guild Treasury is maintained solely on a voluntary basis.  All items and money comes from the generosity of other guild members.  All items in the treasury are available to guild members in need who have passed the one month trial period.   Donated armor and other loot will be held in a guild treasury and distributed to members on a need basis, at no charge to the member.  Members are encouraged to contribute old gear or weapons in "exchange" for new items but it is not required. Distributions are at the discretion of the Treasurer. Please be considerate of other members needs when requesting multiple items.

<br /><br />
If you receive armor or funds from the guild treasury will be expected to return when it is no  longer useful or to pass it on to other members.   In the instance of items that are "non returnable" -- research components, spells,  platinum pieces supplied to fund tradeskills etc., it is hoped that the member benefitting from the item(s) will offer the treasury items when they  have some available or provide tradeskill services for their guildmates at cost. 
<br /><br />

<b>High-end item donations:</b><br />
From time to time, high end items may find their way into our Guild Treasury.   Distribution will be decided by a vote of two officers in cases of very high end gear.  In the case of multiple requests for a single item, all attempts will be made to distribute to the requesting party with the greatest need.</p>

<p> <b>Using Porters/Rezzers/Corpse Summoning</b><br />
Members <I>may charge</I> for ports, rezzes etc. except when members are attending a specifically designated guild function. Members are encouraged to work out trades or other methods of payment if possible. (This policy is intended to prevent our friends and guildmates from being hounded for ports etc...) 

<p> <b>Selling Gear to Members</b><br />
Members are encouraged to offer their old gear for sale to other members if 
they can.  Sellers are <I>not expected</I> to sell gear for less than market value unless they feel able to do so, no one is expected to sell at a loss.

<p> <b>Tradeskills</b><br />
Members are encouraged to take up tradeskills and to offer their wares to guild members at cost.  From time to time it will be possible to financially assist members with monies toward their trade development. 

<p> <b>Roleplaying </b><br />
Roleplaying your character can be fun but it is not for everyone. Please be respectful of your fellow members. 

<p> <b>Powergaming</b><br />
The guild is not dedicated to powergaming though experience groups are certainly encouraged and as we grow raids will be planned for both exp and for loot.   

<p> <b>Power Leveling</b><br />
The guild does not operate a power leveling service, though within the spirit of the guild, assisting other members in leveling is encouraged.  Players asking for help should realize that if someone is assisting them, they are taking time away from their our leveling and should be considerate of asking for assistance frequently.
