 <blockquote><font color="#FFFFFF">Long ago one of my fellow members (sadly,
 I cannot remember who) asked if we had a guild armory.&nbsp; Not knowing
 what that was, I asked him.&nbsp; He told me that another guild he was
 in had a collection of weapons and armor that the people in the guild both
 contributed to and took from for the betterment of the gear of the guild.&nbsp;
 I thought that it was&nbsp; good idea, but without the website it would
 have been impossible to manage.&nbsp; Now that we have a website, I am
 going to start putting things up here that are available to the guild for
 use.&nbsp; If you have anything, please <a href="mailto:to_heroes@charter.net?subject=Gear for the Guild!">email</a>
 me and let me know.&nbsp; I will try to get a form or something up, but
 in the meantime just send it to me with a pic if you can get it (just take
 a screenshot of it while you are looking at it).</font>
