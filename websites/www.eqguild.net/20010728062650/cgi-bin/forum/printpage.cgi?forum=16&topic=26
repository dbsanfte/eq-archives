        Hail Guardians, <br> &nbsp;As some of you know, &nbsp;I will be leaving the guild, those of you whom were logged on the otehr day, &nbsp;saw that I, Omare, and Darlacene were argueing over helping, well, I feel it was wrong, and I normally help anyone out whereever needed, &nbsp;no matter what, just talk to an Undead Legion member, &nbsp;that has been around for a while, &nbsp;and they will tell you, I, will help out whenever possible. &nbsp;I dont mind helping you guys out, &nbsp;just plan it ahead, cuz I had a goal when making Mastenn, and that was to level him up as fast as I could, &nbsp;with little to no downtime at all, &nbsp;I wanna be 51 with my Epic, &nbsp;that weas my Goal and I plan to achieve it soon. &nbsp;As for the Helping part, plan it out, &nbsp;and let me know it in advance, and I will do my best to be there, Real Life Pending, just send me a tell. &nbsp;I will still be leaving the guild, as &nbsp;Ido not see the way the arguement, that took place the other day, went correctly, &nbsp;nor was handled in a matter that it could have been. &nbsp;I will be around, &nbsp;just send a tell, and I will do my best to help. <br> <br>Darlacene, &nbsp;I truly wanted to tell you in person, &nbsp;but I havent caught ya online, and when we were, &nbsp;I was getting bombarded with crap. and I apologize whole heartedly. <br> <br>Mastenn Darezzinmann

        Well... well...I am sure you would have expected that I would reply to this.  I truly appreciate the points you gave about helping when YOU have the time, RL and otherwise. When I formed this guild it was requested of me to do so by my friends. So that we would have a fun loving friendly family atmosphere. We all agreed at the last officer meeting to keep the guild in this manner.  I am sorry that the argument happened but truly is was for the reasons previously stated. I was being asked to drop what I was doing and run to help someone on a quest when I had already made plans to help another guildmate on a quest that weekend.  I do love to help and had offered my help the day before to this other guildmate. When I told of my dilemma, mastenn, You got mad and said the other guildmate was mad.  This was not acceptable by me or the two other officers that were on at the time.  It was in my error that I meant to send a tell to mastenn and it went in guild chat. I truly apologize for that. It was to be a private matter.  And shall be from this point on.  I just thought the guild needed to see a reply from me on this matter. <br>I am looking forward to much fun with quests, raids, and just hanging out with everyone.  As far as helping goes... I think we are all on the same page with that.. We should all request when we would like some help But I do not expect anyone to leave a group or hunt they are on if it is not an emergency.  Now If anyone is in trouble and need me on the double.. Count On It!! <br> <br>Keep it Real! <br> <br> <br>(Edited by Darlacene at 11:37 am on June 17, 2001)

        Well Darla, I didnt get mad, until Omare started in Guildchat with what he said, that I didnt appriciate. &nbsp;As for when you logged on and I asked you if you would help him, &nbsp;I didnt mean, &nbsp;yes go now, &nbsp;help out with whatever, &nbsp;I mighta stated it wrong, &nbsp;or you missunderstood, either way, it was meant if you werent busy, &nbsp;and you wanted to, then he would like help, and if I aint mistaken you said I would have to clear it with Omare and see what we are doing tonight. and I said Okay thats fine. &nbsp;I wasnt mad, &nbsp;nor was he. <br> <br>And yes, &nbsp;I dont mind helping, I could care less if I have to run clear across the map to help, &nbsp;or otherwise, just dont catch me when I am on a camp or whatever, &nbsp;if I am sittin in EC messin around, &nbsp;and you ask for help, &nbsp;I will come there, but if I am in Lower Guk on a camp, and you ask for help, &nbsp;I aint coming right then and there, cuz that screws the party there I am with. &nbsp;And yes sometimes in RL, &nbsp;I have emergencys, like the Security Forces need to get into the Bomb Dump, &nbsp;or Flare needs to be delivered to the Planes up on the Flightline, &nbsp;or whatever, &nbsp;and like last week, &nbsp;we had a Mobility Exercise, &nbsp;I worked a random schedule, &nbsp;Military comes first, everything else, Including family is second. You yourself know this &nbsp;Darla, so sometimes even when it is planned out, &nbsp;i cant make it, &nbsp;just like you and Omare did the other night with Mistmoore. I understand your Daughter had a Performance or something to that effect. <br> <br>Mastenn

        I am real Glad to see that Omare can handle this like an Adult, by sending me a tell, calling me a little Baby, and telling me this is all my Fault, and that he has helped me out tons of times, and I help him out once, then puts me on Ignore, &nbsp;and keeps sending me messages, I am really and Truly glad that he handled it like an Adult. &nbsp; <br> <br>Also, I am glad that a Game such as this would come between friends like it has, over something so trivial. &nbsp;Well if ya want me to say it I will, &nbsp;Yes its all my Fault, &nbsp;I never help anyone, I never pulled a Friend out of a Fear Raid to summon your Corpse out of the Lava pit in Lavastorm Omare, no I never got tons of Sands of Ro for you Darla, nor that rock stuff from Sol A, nor the Kilij Plans, I mean hell, &nbsp;I never pulled your friends Body out of Karnors, nope, &nbsp;wasnt me. &nbsp;Nope, &nbsp;I never sat in Permafrost with you guys hours on end trying to get god knows what out of there, Nope wasnt me... BUT It was ME whom would always ask for help from you when I needed it in camping whatever, &nbsp;yup it was me who always needed you to port me, &nbsp;yup it was me time and again talking to you about things that were going on in my RL. <br> <br>But since I am on ya'lls Ignore list, &nbsp;you cant hear my apology, &nbsp;so &nbsp;so long my Friends, and good night. <br> <br> <br>Mastenn <br>

        Whoa Whoa Whoa! &nbsp;Why must I be put in this conversation? &nbsp;I have not spoken to you, mastenn, in days. &nbsp;Last time we chatted was in EC when we grouped to hang out. &nbsp;I thought things were fine. Then, you quit. Which is your choice. Apparently this whole situation was too much for you. Which is again fine with me. Let it go.. it is only a GAME! &nbsp;This is not the place to be airing dirty laundry. Dang.. you have my phone number, call me and omare to work it out if ya want. &nbsp;This is ridiculous to cause an upset in our guild over what I thought was a small disagreement. &nbsp;This should be done and over with. &nbsp;I have not played Darla for about a week now...trying to let things cool down. I just wanted the peace among friends and our guild family. &nbsp;I am sorry that you feel the way you do...talk to ME about it if it is bothering you. I thought we were friends and as far as all that you just wrote..WOW! &nbsp;I never even said a thing to you and I got dragged in it. &nbsp;WE helped Each other thru lots of emotional topics online and on the phone. Dude, I thought we were bonded...Wow &nbsp;Where's the love? &nbsp;I believe feelings got hurt and now the digs are flying. &nbsp;I would really appreciate it, if we put a stop to it here for the guild's sake. &nbsp;You were an officer in the guild, you know that this is not the place for this. If you really would like to talk to me and work this out... call me, email me, or send me a tell. &nbsp;Good God.. We have been friends for nearly a year now..close friends.. look to the dragon dude...:) <br>My apologies to the guild for this.... &nbsp;I know that all of you have had an argument at one time or another and realize that most of these accusations flying back and forth are just spit and anger. &nbsp;Those of you who know the 3 of us well.. Know that WE ALL HELP Peeps and WE are ALL Good peeps. &nbsp;The hurt is causing this argument to continue because of these facts..we all keep feeling like we need to defend ourselves..ugh &nbsp; <br>Let me be the first one here to STOP THIS! &nbsp;I am hoping we can work it out .... Friends don't come easy. <br> <br>Keep it Precious!
