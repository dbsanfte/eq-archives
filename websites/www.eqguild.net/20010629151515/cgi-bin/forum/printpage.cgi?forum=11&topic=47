        Opal, here's a new thread that will hopefully make it easier for you to see who is still having problems accessing the member's only sections of the board. <br> <br>Kayenya, Kristianie, Incogneito (new member), Margatha (new member) <br> <br>If any other Wolf Den members can't access the private board, please post your name here. <br> <br> <br>(Edited by Lilla at 4:17 pm on May 23, 2001)

        New members needing access to message boards are: &nbsp;Bomadil Highlizard, Urreal/Arrym...hmmm..my mind is kinda fuzzy at the moment... ;) <br> <br>But I know those two need access priviledges to the members section of the boards.

Bad Keyeyna, no cookie! <br>Re-registering means there are now TWO keyenas. This is a big hassle for me as the board admin. As Lilla said, if you need access to the private forums JUST POST YOUR NAME HERE. Access is not automatic! The reason you need to post here is so that I can go in and edit your username and GIVE you access. Going willy-nilly and clogging up the member files with extra usernames will only bring down the wrath of Me.

        Kayenya - has two usernames. I need to delete one. Once I know which one to keep I will give the other one access. <br>Kristianie - already has access... password problems? Not using correct upper/lower case? <br>Incogneito - no such member on this board <br>Dinumura - no such member on this board <br>Margatha - no such member on this board <br>Yari - done <br>disasterr - done <br>Falicias &nbsp;- done <br>Qalnea - already had access...forget password? <br>Qaly - granted access, but do you want me to delete this one? <br>Bomadil Highlizard - no such member on this board <br>Urreal/Arrym - no such member on this board <br> <br>

        deleting both won't accomplish anything :) Just tell me which one to keep. In the admin section, when I go into each member's info, there is a set of check boxes for all the private forums. I just need to put a check in the ones a person has access to. It's a simple process, I just need to know which one to do :)

        Of course you're still having issues :) This is the first time I've seen your name here so it's the first opportunity I have to go in and give you access, silly.
