   <LI><B>Saturday 2nd, February 2002 - Plane of Hate</b><BR>
The plane of Hate was our playground for the day. Well, I say our playground but it was more of a war zone.<p>
We attempted a zone in break, and as usual our luck held for about 3 seconds before glorious chain aggro meant we got half the cleric population of the floor making their way to say hello.<p>
Well, now the greetings were out the way, the newly rezzed parties formed up at the SW corner. Things went distinctly more smoothly from here on in. Although since this was our first time pulling Hate we did not move as quickly as perhaps we could.<p>
We cleared the 3 nearby buildings in the SW corner, then proceeded to clear the large cleric building. Soon we changed direction and started to clear the maestros chapel. Eventually that building too was cleared, culminating in the kill of the mini-boss (named abhorrent). Maestro himself was not there to greet us, instead he just left a friendly hand to play the organ.<p>
We continued to pull a bit of the south east corner, and finished off the main cleric building. But we had been taking our time and it seemed a good point to finish. It felt good to play in Hate. Hopefully soon we will get to play there again.

   <LI><B>Wednesday 30th, January 2002 - Reavers in CoM</b><BR>
Heading into CoM to try out luck with the Jade Reavers, this raid consisted as usual of Omerta and Celestial Rising. We got 
to the Reaver building without incident, but then by some nice chain aggro we got 3 reavers from the attic room, whilst still in the entrance hall.<p>
After picking ourselves back up, we cleared the reaver room and as we have come to expect they decided to keep hold of any jade reavers.

   <LI><B>Tuesday January 29th, 2001 - Our first level 60!</b><BR>
Well, it had to happen to someone, but after months of hard slog, determination and incessant fighting Breiz not only reached level 60 - but he also got himself a surname! 
<BR>
Congratulations to Breiz Bladebreaker on his amazing achievement.

   <LI><B>Saturday January 20th, 2002 - Kael Arena</b><BR>
Another stint in Kael looking for armour pieces. We made two visits there - one in the morning with allies, and another more informal raid later on with other friends. 
<BR>We had numerous drops - probably our most prolific set of quest armours to date. Also for the first time we successfully attempted Bjorak the Cold and looted a Sceptre of Mastery.
<BR>Caster Face Mask - Unforgettable 
<BR>Chain Boots - Rinaldi 
<BR>Chain Boots - Womack 
<BR>Gladiator Leggings - Kaynos 
<BR>Leather Breastplate - Kaynos 
<BR>Leather Boots - Mystyfy 
<BR>Leather Gloves - Mystyfy 
<BR>Plate Arms - Augusta 
<BR>Plate Bracer - Alonia 
<BR>Sceptre of Mastery - Sifujun 
<BR>Silk Gloves - Kwanii 
<BR>Silk Gloves - Mousee 
<BR>Silk Gloves - Timmywimmy 
<BR>Silk Gloves - Ramdar

<BR>Thunder Etched Gauntlets - Mystyfy 
<BR>Plate Vambraces - Arms - Tignous 
<BR>Leather Gloves - Priwinn 
<BR>Chain Boots - Rinaldi 
<BR>There were other items, but in all reality there were so many drops that we all lost count.... We're becoming a much stronger force now, so our trips there are becoming far more productive. With all our time spent in Velketors it should not be long until we're all kitted out in our Thurgadin quest armour.

   <LI><B>January 19th, 2002 - CoM - Jade Reavers</b><BR>
We finally plucked up courage to head to CoM and pay the Jade Reavers and Lord Rakashir a visit. 
<BR>To seal the alliance between Celestial Rising, Lions of the Heart and ourselves the three guilds headed out in force to the City of Mist to pay the Reavers a visit. 
<BR>We commenced by taking Lord Rakashir down. It was an odd fight, clerics chain healing Lontik, fire pet of guest mage, Faywik, whilst the melees could only sit and watch. Sadly Lontik could not understand the command tank push and pushed the Lord right into the lake below the bridge where the fight took place. With a little reluctance we all jumped in and continued our healing - as our enduring breath casters hurriedly learnt spells and go us breathing again. The fight was quite long, and we had one cleric fatality, and a few other fatalities owing to the Lords AOE. Eventually we managed to take him down on our first successful attempt. Although noone as actually at this point in their epic, it provided us with a great opportunity to get to grips with the tactics for this battle in future. 
<BR>We then took our campspot inside the house where the Reavers reside. We managed to kill the reavers two times, with the exception of the one lurking in a building somewhere in the sky. We will leave that one for another day. 
<BR>We did however wait until the commencement of the third spawn in order to obtain books for all shaman present in the raid - this was the battle we'd been waiting for... each time we took the reaver down another spawned in its place. After five spawns of the reaver he finally fell. We a tough fight and we had only one fatality. 
<BR>In terms of loot, this was a very successful raid indeed. 
Clay (Component for Cannibalise II): Carneas, Megwyn 
<BR>Jade Reaver: Mystyfy 
<BR>Moss: Kwanii, Trewfelagh 
<BR>Ornate Runed Blade:

   <LI><B>January 17th, 2002 - A New Alliance </b><BR>
It's taken us a while to formalise everything, but we are now allied with Celestial Rising and Lions of the Heart . Expect to see more of their faces on our raids and when we're out on simple xp jaunts.

   <LI><B>January 17th, 2002 The Velium Focus Quest </b><BR>
We were led by Dissb to Burning Woods amongst other places, and in a matter of hours we were able to track down amongst other things, the items we required from the killing of the acolytes of Zek. <BR>
Just as we were winding down tp finish the quest, the corrupted black panther made its way towards us, we were caught completely off guard, our buffs were fading and we had all gone into relaxed mode. An amazing fight ensued, and we had to fight hard to ensure lives were not lost. The panther fell just as we were using the last dregs of mana we had and we managed to loot the corrupted Panther skin. The skin is part of the Natures Defender paladin quest and although we currently have no Tunare aligned paladins, we are keeping gold of the skin, until we can complete the quest. <BR>
We obtained components for Babbax, Dissb, Peppar and Rikera. 
Phenocryst's Focus [Magic, Lore, No Drop] <BR>
AC 5 DEX 3, CHR 3, INT 10, MANA 40, SV FIRE/DISEASE/POISON/COLD 3, SV MAGIC 5 <BR>
along with a few spells and a bardsong. <BR>
Many thanks to Dissb for leading us on this one.

   <LI><B>January 14th, 2002 - Kedge</b><BR>
We wanted to remind Phinny what we were made of so headed back to Kedge. At first we thought we had successfully pulled him alone, but we soon discovered that a couple of his swirlspine complete healing friends had come along for the ride. The clerics were asked to camp, and a huge battle ensued. We managed to somehow keep our heads and turn the fight around in our favour, despite Phinny being complete healed twice. Sadly, he was not carrying anything that we were hoping for on this attempt. 
<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">


   <LI><B>January 13th, 2002 - Epic Day</b><BR>
Started with another attempt at Phinny, as before we cleared the initial seahorses without any problem. We then set up a chain tagging system for the pull of Phinny himself comprised of Skarrad, Darkzero and Breiz. We successfully managed to bring Phinny in solo and without the aid of his complete healing friends we were able to kill him. <BR>
We then moved to Castle Mistmoore, where we sought out the Dire Wolf. One fight later and Womack was a step towards his Black Fur Boots and his own shaman epic. <BR>
We then attempted to fight The General in Kithicor forest for Dunkkins epic. We wanted an epic fight and that is exactly what we got. <BR>
We started with 37 people levels 45+, after a lot of ingenious thinking and some skillful pulling from Breiz, Bwuce, Darkzero we then fought The General - which quite skillfully resulted in 36 corpses a buoyant and happy General - and Darkzero kiting until we could get everyone rezzed and back on their feet, which in itself is no mean feat. <BR>
After a few personnel changes, we tried a second time. Again, we were unable to land a complete heal cycle on Breiz - the General quads in the region of 800 per round - plus a proc of 500, hence our dilemma. We refused to give up - we refused to give up - we'd been there for six hours already and figured that the gains to be had in defeating The General far outweighed the risk of another death. <BR>
Fortunately some friends in high places came to our aid, with a level 60 and 59 warrior (Lenaic and Thristam)to add to the meat barrier. Also managed to up the cleric count to 7, with a new plan: That all healers chain heal the main tank, with the main clerics complete healing permanently, we continued. Lenaic fell almost immediately, and a little ping pong ensued as The General commenced wiping us out, what was fast becoming a bit of a habit. By some luck, we were able to maintain healing on Thristam and others long enough to take him down to low hits. A number of nukes later and The General finally fell. Dunkkin was rezzed almost immediately so that he could claim his prize: The Generals Pouch. <BR>
Dunkkin is now very close to completing his epic thw only thing he needs is the Kedge Robe, so we shall be spending some quality time there in search of this item. <BR>
Special thanks to all who helped, there are far too many to mention - although we are all very thankful to Ezra for her tremendous work with her rez stick. Dunkkin is now a small step away from claiming his epic. He is only hindered by the Kedge Robe, hence Phinny farming will commence. 
<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">


   <LI><B>January 7th, 2002 - Renux and Kedge</b><BR>
Thanks to everyone who came out to help with Renux for the rogue epic today. We were unable to tank her so had great fun aggro kiting her. Special thanks to Valkyrie and Lions of the Heart for their assistance. Congratulations to Dunkkin on being another step closer to your epic. <BR>
After that we headed to Kedge with the Lions and a couple of friends to give Phinny a stab. We managed to wipe out the Swirlspine seahorses, but for the second time, Phinny won the battle as we were unable to pull him singally. We have a few more ideas up our sleeve, so we shall seek our revenge next time. 
<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">


   <LI><B>January 6th, 2002 - Kael</b><BR>
Revisited Kael, as it is rapidly becoming one of our regular haunts. it's a good place to practice tactics and to get good quest armour upgrades. We concentrated on Riff House cycle again and got a couple of drops, although nothing of particular significance. 
<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">


   <LI><B>January 5th, 2002 - Kael</b><BR>

We decided to give Kael a real going over with an open invite to others. The arena was already camped to we headed to the Riff House and completed the cycle a few times. This went smooth as clockwork and we were fotunate to have 3 plate quest pieces drop and also some SK only boots. <BR>
We then headed over to the arena to try and get some quest armour pieces for the other classes. Things went very smoothly indeed and in the arena we picked up roughly 2 plate, 1 leather, 2 chain and 3 silk thurgadin quest armour pieces. <BR>
Since things were going well we decided to try the Protectors of Zek. Although the first attempt seemed to be a clean split one other warped afterwards, a little too late to react and we got wiped out. We were back up and running very quickly though and in time to clear the normal spawns. We tried a couple of other tactics to split the protectors and via two different methods we managed a nice smooth split and killed both protectors and Kallis. <BR>
Thanks to all who joined us, especially to Asphyxiating Decay who had a strong showing. Breiz and Darkzero did a really great job running the show.
<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

   <LI><B>January 3rd, 2002 - Plane of Hate</b><BR>
Today Laberdere from four elements was organising a Hate raid, so most of us jumped at the chance to give it another shot. We were based at the south west corner. Laberdere had to leave early and so Breiz took control and so we gained some valuable experience. A few good drops, and a couple of mini-bosses were slain. Thanks to The Hand for providing us with a very quick CR during the one wipeout, and thanks to four elements for inviting us along in the first place. 
<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

   <LI><B>January 2nd, 2002 - Plane of Hate</b><BR>
Our first Hate raid today. When we started we knew we didn't really have the numbers to do that much, but we wanted to try anyway. Things did not go particularly smoothly, and we had two wipeouts before settling at the south west corner safe spot. This was caused by a bit of bad luck with the zone in patrol, and then being too close together when travelling. We did learn a lot, but had to call it a day quickly due to some key classes having to leave. Most of the people who went had never even been to Hate before let alone tried to organise it themselves. We then headed over to Kael arena, which is more familiar territory and some great fun was had. Thanks to everyone who came, especially the members of Lions of the Heart for their patience and support.
