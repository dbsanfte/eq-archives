      <P>I. The Grey Coalition is hereby founded by the sovereign guilds: Amber 
      Order, Amazon Sisters, Dark Band, Guides of Norrath, Lords of the Unknown, 
      Nihil, Knights of Valor, Remnants of the Circle, Testament of Spirit and 
      Triune Alliance, for the common purpose of building a combined force 
      greater than the individual guild could muster, to bring together 
      harmoniously comrades in arms hailing from different guilds under one 
      banner, and to promote cooperation between guilds in all endeavors.</P>
      <P>II. In the interest of establishing a coalition of guilds, that is true 
      both in word and in deed, a forum shared between the guilds is 
      established. This forum shall be the place designated for the announcement 
      and planning of joint ventures. Conversely, members of the Coalition shall 
      generally be required to announce on the Coalition forum and open up to 
      all member of the Grey Coalition any guild organized missions, raids, or 
      events which in general require more than two groups and that members 
      participating are near level 50 or above. These undertakings shall 
      generally be designated as Coalition Raids, and the primary planning of 
      them shall be done on Coalition boards. Outsiders may be brought in to 
      these events if those leading the raid wish to, and members of guilds in 
      the Coalition may join raids not sponsored by the Coalition unfettered, 
      however, guilds in the Coalition should not sponsor a raid as above 
      defined other than as a Coalition sponsored raid.</P>
      <P>III. Guilds in the coalition shall always respect the sovereign rights 
      of other guilds within the alliance. In the event of an internecine 
      strife, a guild may render aid to another, but in so doing should aim to 
      stabilize internally, rather than break apart. Recruiting for members from 
      other Coalition guilds should generally not be practiced.</P>
      <P>IV. A Grey Council shall be formed, consisting of a single 
      representative from each guild, appointed in a manner chosen by the 
      represented. The Grey Council shall be responsible for approving any new 
      members to the coalition, and this approval shall require unanimity in the 
      Council. The Grey council may enact laws binding to all members, any such 
      law requiring a unanimous vote. In the event of a disagreement arising 
      between members in different guilds, the guilds may ask the Grey Council 
      to act as neutral arbiters to resolve the disagreement. The Grey Council 
      may propose additional Articles, which shall require further approval by 
      each guild’s ruling body. Any guild may elect to send a different 
      representative to the council at any time, or send additional members, but 
      in any case only one vote per represented guild shall be submitted to the 
      council. The Grey Council’s authority shall never extend, fully or in 
      part, beyond the kinds of raids defined in article 2, for which this 
      coalition is founded.</P>
