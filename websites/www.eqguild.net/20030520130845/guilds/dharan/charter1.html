      Every member of this guild is an emissary of The D'Haran Empire throughout the Lands of Norrath and should act in a manner that reflects and upholds the honor of the Empire. This includes how your character behaves throughout all aspects of the game and all communications within and regarding the game.  Always remember that your actions reflect the guild as a whole. While it is not possible to be polite in all situations, please do your best. 
           <br>
           <br>
      <b>We do not encourage higher-level adventurers to power level younger adventurers. If members wish to volunteer to do this, that is fine, but asking for it is not.</b>
           <br>
           <br>
      We do not provide equipment to twink our members. Some members may have extra equipment that they have outgrown that they wish to give or sell to Guildmates, but do not expect free equipment simply because you are in the Guild and continued begging after one warning is grounds for immediate removal from the Guild.  Any extra equipment that you have no need for may be donated to the guild and will be distributed by the treasurer to someone who can use it.  But do not expect handouts. <br>
           <br>

      We strive to keep an ongoing flow of events. These events include hunting events, raids, parties, meetings and quest groups.

      Check the <a href="http://pub18.ezboard.com/bthedharanempire"> <b> Message Board </b> </a> for upcoming events and quests. All Guild members have the opportunity to organize and run events if they wish to do so. Non-Guild adventurers may also participate in our events and quests upon the approval of the event leader.
           <br>
           <br>
      Participation is encouraged in Guild raids and events. These are always fun and are a great way to make friendships as well as having the possibility to win the random roll for equipment and collecting pieces needed for quests.

      A Guild of friendly people to group with, laugh with, and talk to.

      Please understand that having read this Charter and the expectations set forth within it, if you seek an Invitation you are agreeing to live up to the expectations of The D'Haran Empire that have been outlined within these policies or accept the possibility of being removed. The expectations can and will be changed by the Guild Officers and/or the full vote of the Guild. Any concerns voiced about our expectations by members will be discussed and a decision made. 
           <br>
           <br>
      These words are binding in the Lands of Norrath in that removal from the guild will be enacted if they are not heeded. If you find these expectation unacceptable, peace be with you and you have our well wishes that you do find a family that is more suited to your needs. If, on the other hand, you desire to be amongst us, we are waiting to hear from you.
