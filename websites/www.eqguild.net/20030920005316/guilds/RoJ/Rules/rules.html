	<br><br><h1><p align=center><b>Reavers of Justice Official Rules of Conduct</b></p></h1>

<br><p><b><h4><p align=center>General Policies</p></b></h4><br>
<p align=left></p>
<p>1.1  Keep current on the postings on the website and the events scheduled to take place.<br>
1.2  Attend Monthly guild meetings whenever real life permits.<br>
1.3  Take pride in the Guild.  Remember that your actions are a reflection on the entire guild.<br>
1.4  Participate in guild raids and events as often as real life permits.<br>
1.5  Keep an eye out for players who would benefit our guild, and who we would benefit.  When a prospective member is found, refer them to a guild officer for an interview.<br>
1.6  Keep the guild fund growing.</p><br>
<p><h4><p align=center>Officer Rules</p></b></h4><br><p align=left><br>
<p>2.1  Plan a monthly raid for members to attend.<br>
2.2  Post the raid on the website and send an e-mail to Icewind Novastorm <a href="mailto:troykramer@hotmail.com">here</a> so that a general e-mail can be sent out to all members.<br>
2.3  Peform interviews for players who desire to enter the guild.</p><br>
<p><h4><p align=center>Recruiting Rules</p></b></h4><br><p align=left>
3.1  All new prospective guild members will be required to perform certain steps (the REAVER NEW MEMBER QUEST) before they can be accepted into the guild.<br>
3.2  They must intruduce themselves in guild chat, and register for the members page.<br>
3.3  They must read over the guild policies and comply with them.<br>
3.4  They must have a sponsor who will vouch for them to be knowledgable of the game as well as well mannered to others.<br>
3.5  They must understand that there is a 2 week probationary time to ensure both parties (the member and the guild) are happy with the arrangements.</p><br>
<p><h4><p align=center>Guild Funds</p></b></h4><br><p align=left>
Guild funds shall be established for the following reasons:<br>
4.1  To further guild members along with trade skills that will be useful to the guild.  (i.e. Alchemy, Jewelry, Fletching, Smithing)<br>
4.2  To have funds to purchase gems for buffing on raids(or reimbursement of costs that were put out by a member for a raid/event)<br>
4.3  Keep items for new characters or members to start out with (The Website will have a list of available items in guild storage soon).<br>
4.4  <em>AT THIS TIME </em> the guild fund is not used to borrow money for items that you would like to purchase.  This is a new program and more information will be forthcoming after the guild meeting on 4/6/02 - but for now, our purpose is to build up this fund to be of greater service to the guild members in the long run.</p>
<p><h4><p align=center>Chat Protocol</p></b></h4><br><p align=left>
5.1  Guild chat is best used for questions, and for communicating when guild raids are occurring - as well as basic greetings, farewells, etc.<br>
5.2  Guild chat will <b>not</b> be sued to ask other members for <b>power leveling</b> or for <b>begging</b>.  Begging to anyone - in any form is against guild policy.  If an officer sees such an offence, you will be warned, and if it occurs a second time, you will be <em>REMOVED</em> from the guild, NO EXCEPTIONS.  The same applies to requests for Power Leveling.  Power Leveling is something that requires a lot of time and patience by an individual - asking someone you don't know to do this is rude.  Asking people you barely know for money or items is not only annoying, but directly and negatively reflects upon the guild as a whole.<br>
5.3  Use of vulgar language in guild chat is prohibited.  If a members says something offensive, please send the member a direct tell asking them not to do so.  If it cannot be resolved through direct tells, please seek out an officer to deal with the situation.  The officer will issue ONE warning.  That said, we understand that people like to joke around, and occasionally, the game is extremely frustrating (allowing that vulgarity to slip out after you were killed the fourth time due to some idiot's train), but remember that Guild chat is a public channel.<br></p>
