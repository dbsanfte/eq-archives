WALTZING MATHILDA

D	     A                       G
Once a jolly swagman camped beside a billabong
D                    A
Under the shade of a coolibah tree,
       D          A           D                G
And he sang as he watched and waited 'till his billy boiled,
 D                       A             D
"You'll come a waltzing, Mathilda, with me."

     D                    G
     "Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
     D                                      A
     You'll come a waltzing, Mathilda, with me."
            D          A           D                 G
     And he sang as he watched and waited 'till his billy boiled,
     D                         A            D
    "You'll come a waltzing, Mathilda, with me."

Down came a jumpbuck to drink at the billabong,
Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee,
And he sang as he stowed that jumpbuck in his tucker bag,
"You'll come a waltzing, Mathilda, with me."

     {c:Chorus.}

Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred,
Down came the troopers, one, two, three.
"Where's that jolly jumpbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a waltzing, Mathilda, with me."

     {c:Chorus.}

Up jumped the swagman, sprang into the billabong,
"You'll never catch me alive," said he.
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong,
"You'll come a waltzing, Mathilda, with me."

     {c:Chorus.}
