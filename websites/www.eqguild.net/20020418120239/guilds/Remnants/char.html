 We are people who come to Everquest to enjoy a fantastic world in which the realm of magic and the power of the sword help define the game we play. We understand this game is equally defined by the actions and attitude of the game player behind the character(s). We come into this multi-player environment from many backgrounds and many areas of Europe with diverse perspectives and goals in gaming.<br></br>
 <br></br>
 As a guild we focus not only on developing the grouping strategies needed to play this game well, but also on building the interpersonal relationships and trust needed to experience the full gaming potential of Everquest. We choose, individually and voluntarily, to join together Remnants of the Circle to be able to focus on these goals with others of like mind, and to accomplish things together that only strong, well trained groups of players can accomplish in the Everquest environment.<br></br>
 <br></br>
 As individuals within the Remnants of the Circle, we focus on improving our member player's gaming skills and enhancing our character's equipment, knowing that improving our players and their characters helps to improve the guild. We seek to make positive contributions to the guild and its individual members. We practice patience and respect in our dealings with one another. We know that through patience and respect comes understanding, through understanding comes strength and unity, and through these comes a more satisfying gaming experience.<br></br>
 <br></br>
 In order to enhance our gaming experience for all, individual members follow the gaming principles and rules we have established over time for all members of the Remnants of the Circle. These rules are guidelines that we either agree to upon joining the guild or accept later as existing members to meet the changing needs of the guild. Most of our rules are dynamic rather than stagnant as they reflect playing in the expanding environment that is Everquest.<br></br>
 <br></br>
 The Guild Leaders, officers and members of guild donate many hours of their time to help make the Remnants gaming experience meaningful, interesting, and challenging. Everyone in the guild is encouraged to participate in guild events and to attend guild events on a regular basis in order to offer suggestions, voice opinions, and help conduct guild business. The guild membership and its leaders highly value individual opinions. We practice participatory decision-making as an operational standard in our meetings and events.<br></br>
 <br></br>
 Organization is essential to the well-being of the guild. The general membership is responsible to provide the leaders with timely information concerning their membership status in the Remnants of the Circle. Keeping our membership rolls up to date and accurate is basic to the well-being and proper functioning of the guild. As members change the status of their player characters in the guild, or if a member changes his relationships with the Everquest community, we would like to know how these changes affect your relationship with the guild. Members take the responsibility to help us keep our information current. <br></br><br></br>
 
 Introduction of Guildleaders and Circle of Officers:<br></br><br></br>
 
 Guildleader for external affairs: Yitelinla Gatecaller, Mage 59<br></br>
 Yitelinla joined Remnants of the Circle as a level 4 mage apprentice. In her continued effort to focus on the guilds needs and her maintenance of the good name Remnants of the Circle possesses today, she was elected guildleader in January 2001. <br></br>
 Her current role includes the liaison with partner Coalitions and guilds, understanding external politics and the implementation of Remnants into the political Roster on the Bertoxxulous server.<br></br><br></br>
 
 Guildleader for internal affairs: Gilani, Shaman 57<br></br>
 Gilani joined the Remnants in spring 2001 as a level 17 Shaman. She spent her first months learning about Everquest and the people and quickly developed an organizational talent and leadership. Since the beginning of this year, she holds the position as Guildleader for internal affairs.<br></br>
 Her role involves the organization of raids and fun events as well as administration of the web site and the message board. She is also the direct contact person for the Circle of Officers.<br></br><br></br>
 
 Guild Financial Officer: TBA<br></br>
 <br></br><br></br>
 
 Guild Recruiting Officer: TBA<br></br>
 <br></br><br></br>
 
 Guild Advising Officer: TBA<br></br>
 <br></br><br></br>
  
 Remnants of the Circle don't believe in many common recruitment models. We neither have a level or class restriction nor do we exclude alts from the guild. However, there are some guidelines that should be communicated to the prospective new members:<br></br><br></br>
 
 There are no restrictions on race, class, alignment, level, resists, financial situation or anything else.<br></br>
 You can have all your alts in the guild. <br></br>
 Regardless which character is receiving the initial invite, your active main has to join the guild as well. <br></br>
 Should you decide to leave the guild with your main then all your other characters will have to leave the guild as well. <br></br>
 /anon is not allowed. If you would like to hide your class/level from other players, please use the /role command. If an exception needs to be made for this (for example you are participating in another guilds event and they insist that non guilded members are on /anon) please notify the members online in /gu and change it back as soon as the event is over. <br></br>
 Everyone should be available to attend Raids based in the evening range (weekdays) and Weekend day/evening range (weekends) in the GMT time zone. This doesn't necessarily exclude US Americans/Canadians/Japanese or other time zones, as certain individuals might be working at nights and would still be available for raids. <br></br>
 There won't be any probation periods, the new member will be accepted and respected as any other member in the guild. Ranks are only subject and reflections on their work and objectives, not for their dictation over other people.<br></br> 
 Member behaviour: We will not tolerate uncivilised and mean behaviour in the guild.  Example: If an individual is brought into the guild, who annoys people with begging: A warning will be issued to this new guild member. If the same or another annoying issue regarding this individual happens, no further warning will be given, but the person will immediately be relieved from his or her guild tag.<br></br>
 I understand that there are people who do not wish to take on responsibility and a role within the guild. This is completely acceptable and we support those individuals as much as we support everyone else within the guild. <br></br>
 We expect that every member is signed up on http://www.guildmagic.com which provides the officers with up-to-date information about numbers and skills available.<br></br>
 Please do not use /anon. If you would like to hide your class from other players, please use the /role command.<br></br>
 Repeated failure to attend a raid you have signed up for may result in a ban from raids for a certain amount of time. This may seem harsh, but everyone is suffering from the lack of professionalism of those individuals<br></br>
 Friends of other guilds will be allowed to join those raids, but are also required to sign up for it. They must however be aware that they are automatically on the reserve list, if Remnants of the Circle can provide the required manpower on their own.<br></br></font></table>
