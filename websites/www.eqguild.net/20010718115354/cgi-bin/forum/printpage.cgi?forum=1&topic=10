        I'm going to start this off with a reposting from the <a href=http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/000797.html>EQ Message Boards</a>... this is by Sybert: <br> <br><i>I always like to read funny stories about people's experiences in the game. Here's one of mine: <br>I was invisible and running through the Karanas one day when I noticed a young gnome near the gypsy camp. He was fighting a lion and though it looked like he would win the battle, being a fellow gnome, I decided to help the guy out. <br> <br>I targeted the lion, clicked on my mesmerize spell, then *started* to type: "I'm mesmerizing the lion for you." I got as far as: "I'm " when I remembered that I had replaced my mesmerize spell with an Area of Effect mesmerize spell... and that I was standing next to an NPC enchantress. Gulp. <br> <br>My movement keys are mapped to "w a s d" so I frantically stabbed at my keyboard, trying to MOVE and interrupt the spell.  <br> <br>I forgot that I was in typing mode.  <br> <br>The gypsy enchantress didn't like my attempt to mezz her so she promptly charmed me and made me go after the gnome I had been trying to *save*. I watched in horror as my peace-loving character, knife flailing like a crazed sushi chef, chased the little guy down and stabbed him to death. <br> <br>I found my victim later and apologized profusely... I even gave him a nice weapon and a piece of armor. He was great about it, and laughed when I told him what happened.  <br> <br>He said he didn't know WHAT was going on. One minute he was fighting a lion, the next minute a strange gnome appeared out of NOWHERE, announced: "I'm <font color=#FEF7EC>_</font>wwwaaaddd", then sliced him up like Freddy Krueger. <br> <br>[sigh]</i> <br> <br> <br>See if you can top that!
