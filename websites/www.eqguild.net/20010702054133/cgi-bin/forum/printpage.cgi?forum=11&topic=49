        Heya folks, Roganjosh has asked to me get some foraged vegetables so he can make vodka, but unfortunatley my foraging skill is, shall we say, stinktastic. So, can I ask for some donations of foraged vegetables please? Of course I will be happy to pay for any if neccesary.  <br> <br>Also, just to let you know I nearly have a full set of blackened iron now for my outfit, all thats left is the arms and hopefully they will drop tonight. <br> <br>:)

        I will see what I can forage up. &nbsp;I've finally got it mastered and should be able to get what ever you need. &nbsp;Let me know how many vegitables that you need and the lastest that you need them by. <br> <br>

        Mardil, thanks for the offer. Rogan will need as many vegetables as possible as we cannot have too much booze :) If we could get them by friday night, to give him saturday to brew up the juice, it would be great. Thanks again. <br> <br>:)
