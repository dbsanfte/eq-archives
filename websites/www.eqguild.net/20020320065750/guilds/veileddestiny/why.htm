<CENTER><B>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</B></CENTER><BR><BR>Ponder 
these questions. If you can answer "I do" to more than two, you're probably on 
your way to getting kicked out of your guild. <BR>1. I ask (beg) for equipment, 
money, or help levelling from guild members. <BR>2. I have no concept of first 
come first served. <BR>3. I have no concept of sharing spawns. <BR>4. I make 
stupid and offensive comments everytime I open my piehole. <BR>5. I make sure I 
ask the guild repeatedly to price check every lowbie item I'll ever get my 
grubby hands on. <BR>6. I make sure to spam my request even if it has been 
answered. <BR>7. I don't understand what the guild officers mean when they refer 
to people 'walking the line'. <BR>8. I don't get the message when officers 
announce they're turning guild chat off. <BR>9. I get warned but continue doing 
the things I was warned about. <BR>10. I flame the guild for being "pussy's"+ 
and "faggot's"+. <BR><BR><BR>The 10 points above are a brief guide to help out 
those who have a problem understanding why they find themselves suddenly 
unguilded. <BR><BR>I'm not even going to mention: Kill Stealing, Ninja Looting, 
Training, or physical threats/harassment. <BR><BR>+ I know spelling and 
possession are wrong for these words, hence the quotes. <BR><BR>OHHHHHHH, I 
forgot to mention; Your friend's mother's brother's skank cousin niece's friend 
of a friend who also happens to share your account must be to blame for all of 
the wrongdoings. In which case, all is forgiven - <B>NOT.
