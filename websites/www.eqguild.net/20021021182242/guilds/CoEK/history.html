The Council of Elven Knights was created by Frostbane Wolfsongs and his real life wife Alishabane Wolfsongs. Together they brought forth a guild on the Torvonnilous server of Everquest that was about fellowship, adventurers, comrades in arms working together to explore the great continents of Norrath. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
At the end of August, 2002, Frostbane and Alishabane decided that the Council was not going the way they would have liked it to, and so handed the reigns over to Aurumn Crowe and his real life wife Gwaellyn Crowe. Over the next month the council lost most of its members and the situation was looking extremely bleak, but with the addition of several new officers the guild began to revive.
</p>
<br>
<p>
With new officers busily recruiting and fresh faces on guildchat, Aurumn and Gwaellyn hope to revive the flagging Council and bring it to its former glory -- of a Guild on Torvonnilous that is loved and trusted. The guild leaders are working hard to attain that goal.
