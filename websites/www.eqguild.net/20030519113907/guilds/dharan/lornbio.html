I was born on the new moon of the spring equinox. Birthplace was the city of Aydindril in the Midlands. My parents were of royal heritage, which was cause enough for me to strive for independence. At the age of five, I got the calling to be a druid. 
<br><br>
I began my training in the Wizard's Keep, studying for many years about the arcane arts and soon learned the use of such magics. I also trained with the best warrior’s in the art of defence and offence. I refused to be treated special because of my heritage, and excelled in leadership and independence. 
<br><br>
When the news came that the Emperor of the Old World , was invading our borders and spreading his evil throughout our land. I knew what I had to do.
<br><br>
I selected the very best warriors and casters in the New World, to form my group of Elites. I led this group to defend the lands of the D’Haran Empire, and the New World lands. My adventures took me to the new land called Norrath.
