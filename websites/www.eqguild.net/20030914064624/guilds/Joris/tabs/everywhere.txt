INTRO: Am C G G  2X

Am             C            G
Turn it inside out so I can see
Am                     C             G
The part of you that's drifting over me
                      D                G
And when I wake you're,  you're never there
                 Am      D           G
And when I sleep you're, you're everywhere
            Am       C       G 
You're everywhere


Just tell me how I got this far
Just tell me why you're here and who you are
Cause every time I look you're never there
And every time I sleep you're always there

             Fmaj7   C        G
Cause you're every - where to me 
                    Fmaj7     C     G
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
                    Fmaj7     C        G
You're everything I know that makes me believe
        Fmaj7    C     G  
I'm not alone
               Am   C   D
I'm not alone


I recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
                     Dsus            G
I sense that now the water's getting deep
                  E              C   B/C  Dsus
I try to wash the pain away from me

             Fmaj7   C        G
Cause you're every - where to me 
                    Fmaj7     C     G
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
                    Fmaj7     C        G
You're everything I know that makes me believe
        Fmaj7    C     G  
I'm not alone


Fmaj7            C         G
When I touch you hand it's then I understand
    Fmaj7             C        G
The beauty that's within, it's now that we begin
    Fmaj7           C          G
You always light my way, there never comes a day
   Fmaj7          C     G
No matter where I go, I always feel you so


             Fmaj7   C        G
Cause you're every - where to me 
                    Fmaj7     C     G
And when I close my eyes it's you I see
                    Fmaj7     C        G
You're everything I know that makes me believe
        Fmaj7    C     G  
I'm not alone

Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I catch my breath it's you I breathe
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone

          Fmaj7   C     G
You're in every - one I see
           Fmaj7   C             G
So tell me            do you see me
