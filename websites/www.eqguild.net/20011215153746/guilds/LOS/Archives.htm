<p align="left">As I am sure most of you know by now the guild is no more. This 
does not come to me as a surprise after seeing how Jade was leading the guild. 
For you that how not seen this part I will be starting a guild with Bondeye, 
Chowchow and Shinrah. This will have rules just like it should but unlike EC 
every one will follow then even the leaders will. If you would like to be apart 
of this guild send me a E-mail and when we have more info I will reply to it 
with times and so on. I will not lie to you I have never been leader of a guild 
before but I have leadership skills from being a leader of clans in other games. 
At first this will be a long road but travel but I am willing to take this step</p>
