        Hey Tukim! &nbsp;Glad to see you made it to our message board! &nbsp;Hehe...and don't worry about the buffs. &nbsp;When I see you coming I'll be sure to run far far....I mean, I'll be sure to be generous with the buffs *gulp -- don't hurt me* <br> <br>hehe...Hope to see you at the party on Saturday! <br> <br>Annadryl, you keep him in line until then! &nbsp;(btw, I was in Unrest the other day and he was there...the whole zone was live until he passed gas...next thing I knew, it was a zone full of undead. &nbsp;What are you guys feeding him? &nbsp;Surely woodelves don't do that!*

        Hey Tukim! &nbsp;We seem to be running different hours nowadays :( &nbsp;But hopefully we can catch up soon and group up...or if nothing else, I can offer crowd control while you group with people closer to your area in Cazic....hehe...I love getting to act like a mini-god (now that my spells aren't constantly resisted ;) ) <br> <br>You know how much I love grouping with you hon :D
