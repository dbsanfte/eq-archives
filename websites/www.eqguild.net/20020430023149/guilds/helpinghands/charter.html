 <h1><u><i><b>Helping Hands Charter</b></i></u></h1>
 <div align="Left">
 <ol>
   <li>The ultimate purpose of the guild is to assist others in their exploits 
 of the wolrd of Norrath by any means possible. With this goal in mind, guild 
 members are to travel & explore Norrath to gain knowledge to share with 
 all travelers.</li>
   <li>To protect and defend the Helping Hands guild. All guild members will 
 do their best in brining honor and recognition to the guild. Any shame brought 
 upon the guild could result in the guild to be mistrusted or viewed with skeptism.</li>
   <li>The use of vulgar or foul language will not be toloerated in any form 
 of text. Repeated offences could be grounds for dismissial from the guild.</li>
   <li>Harrassement of another player will not be toloerated. Try to resolve 
 all conflicts between players. If it can not be resolved, then the member 
 should ignore the offending player. A list of players that are well known 
 for causeing trouble and who would be better left alone will be maintaned 
 by the guild on it's website.</li>
   <li>No "Kill Stealing". Defined as the intentional taking of a kill from 
 someone else who was fighting it first without them asking or yelling for 
 help.</li>
   <li>At this time, the Helping Hands are accepting applications from all 
 PC's. If a true newbie, the guild will assist them in the mechanics of the 
 game and structure of the world. All applicates will read the charter, then register on Guild Magic. Once approved, An officer will invite them into the guild. They will be on probation for 1 month for the guild to get to know them and visa versa. 
 Official guild members will then at the next meeting deside on the permenant 
 placement into the guild as a member.</li>
   <li>No BEGGING from guild members. We are formed to assist and offer what we can to each other and other travelers. Begging for stuff shows lack of  respect and will not be tolerated. </li>
   <li>No one shall use the ANONYMOUS option in the guild. You are allowed to use the ROLEPLAY option, which will still show you as anonymous, but will also allow you to be seen in Guild who all's. Violation of this rule, can result in immediate removal from guild.</li>
   <li>HAVE FUN !!</li>
 </ol>
