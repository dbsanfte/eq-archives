             <b><a name="policies"></a> </b><b>General Guild Policies</b><br>
             Please be aware of our guild rules. They are as follows: <br>
             <br>
             1. All new members must have attained at least level 8 to be considered 
             for membership in the guild. <br>
             <br>
             2. All new members (and old members who haven't done so yet) must 
             register with our <a href="http://communities.msn.com/EQGuardiansoftheTruth/messageboard.msnw" target="_blank">forum</a> 
             and with our <a href="member.html">member list on guild magic</a>. 
             Guild officers will record the name of each new recruit and will enforce 
             this policy.<br>
             <br>
             3. Using Anonymous is not allowed. Anonymous is considered hiding 
             your guild for ill behaviour and hides your existence from the guild 
             roster as well. Please use roleplay if you want to go anonymous. <b><br>
             <br>
             4. Do not beg for Money, Equipment, Power Leveling or ask to be twinked. 
             Power Leveling, begging, and rude behavior are not allowed or approved 
             by Guardians of Truth, and will result in intervention by the officers 
             (i.e. you WILL be kicked out). </b>There is nothing wrong with making 
             reasonable requests (a TP, CR or Rezz) but if no one can, then accept 
             they can't at that time. If no one responds to your request <b>do 
             not beg or spam the guild chat channel. </b><br>
             <br>
             5. If someone in the guild gives you an item or items, DO NOT sell 
             them. If you are no longer going to use them, offer them to a low 
             level character in the guild at no charge. <br>
             <br>
             6. Respect the guild members, we are all here to enjoy our time on 
             the server. I'm sure we would all love to help you with every request, 
             but if the guild is busy, stop asking for the day. <br>
             <br>
             7. Be polite and sociable with your guild mates. If a guild mate makes 
             a reasonable request, and you can help them, then do so.<br>
             .<br>
             8. Do not try to rip off your guild, If you get an item that is worth 
             300-500p offer it up to the guild for 300p or maybe even 200p. <br>
             <br>
             9. If you are looking to accomplish something you can't do yourself, 
             please go to the <a href="http://communities.msn.com/EQGuardiansoftheTruth/messageboard.msnw" target="_blank">forum 
             and post a request</a> or talk to an officer in-game. The guild will 
             try to organize some help for you.<br>
             <br>
             10. Any in-game problems or disputes will be decided by officers. 
             Every officer has the power to remove players from the guild and will 
             do so without hesitation for breaking the rules.<br>
             <br>
             11. All officers will anounce their arrival on line, as has been standard 
             for some time already.<br>
             <br>
             12. Officers will hold a meeting at the end of each month, on the 
             last Sunday 12.00 PST on the chat, to discuss any and all Guild related 
             issues. <br>
             <br>
             <b>And finally and most importantly,</b><br>
             <b>13. Have fun, it's just a game. Remember that and don't stress.</b>

             <p><a name="hole"></a> <b>Descent into the Hole</b></p>
             <p>Over the past two weeks, our guild has had two adventures in the 
               deep, dank dungeon known as The Hole. The first trip took place 
               on January 5th and involved Goragg, Saeaddilzz, Milrsok, Enlil, 
               Keldora, Featherie, Zzaxe and Irezz who succesfully camped the entrance 
               and pulled rock golems from deep inside. During the evening they 
               obtained a pair of Loam Encrusted Lined Shoes and many Elemental 
               Binders (magician only item). </p>
             <p>The second trip took place on January 19th and included Wien, Akaver, 
               Iluvia, Nerlo, Grinderwaldrf, Saeaddilzz, Milrsok, Quantum, Featherie 
               and Daisy, and non-guild warrior. This time the entrance was unfortunately 
               camped, so we wandered deeper into the Hole, past the first room 
               and pulled from the tower. It was definitely challenging, with a 
               rock golem and 3 elementals spawning together all at once. Luckily, 
               we did have 3! Chanters with us. This dungeon definitely takes a 
               toll on the caster classes because the mobs hit hard and there is 
               no place to run. Although almost all casters died once throughout 
               the evening, I think a good time and some experience was had by 
               all. We got two two loam encrusted gorgets and a loam encrusted 
               sash for our magic users out of the evening. </p>
             <p>Here's hoping for more trips to this interesting but dangerous 
               place! </p>
             <p><a name="kedge"></a><b>A Watery Adventure</b></p>
             <p>On January 4, an impromptu trip to Kedge Keep turned into a guild 
               raid when Goragg asked for backup on guild chat. <br>
               <br>
               For those of you who don't know about Kedge, it's a completely underwater 
               zone off of Daugnor's Cauldron, populated by fish and mermaids of 
               all types. It's quite difficult to fight there because of pathing 
               issues and easy to get trained if you don't pull well. Fear doesn't 
               work there because of these same pathing issues. <br>
               <br>
               Our ranger Wien has been after a particular quest item in Kedge 
               for the past 5 levels or so. It is a lock of golden hair from the 
               Golden haired mermaid for a quest that results in a very cool bow. 
               Nerlo, Grinders, Goragg, Akaver and I have been there once before, 
               but alas, the Mermaid never graced us with her presence - only some 
               nasty fish as PHs. We made plans to come back tonight and see if 
               we could get her to spawn. However, it turns out that Goragg was 
               discussing our plans on guild chat and by the time I logged in an 
               entire guild raid was in progress!<br>
               <br>
               We had two full groups going, and logistics for that many people 
               are very difficult. However, Zzaxe took organization upon himself 
               and formed two well-balanced groups. We all followed Wien inside 
               and cleared the first room. Then we went to the second level and 
               went into the mermaid room. Unfortunately, only fish were present. 
               Then Goragg started pulling fish (all blue to me, level 44) and 
               a gloomwater mermaid or two (level 38-45). However, the crowning 
               achievement of the evening in terms of mobs killed were two level 
               49 fish named CauldronBoil and CauldronBubble!<br>
               <br>
               I am happy to report that there was only one death during the three 
               hours we were there, and that was because Goragg pulled not only 
               a gloomwater mermaid but about 4 other fish. Grinders kindly resurrected 
               Goragg however, so it wasn't that bad. <br>
               <br>
               And most importantly, the golden haired mermaid finally spawned 
               and graciously gave Wien a lock of her hair. So the evening was 
               a success in several ways - Wien accomplished his quest, and we 
               all had a very interesting experience in Kedge. Everyone fought 
               together in an exemplary fashion, supporting each other, listening 
               to the organizers, and most importantly, assisting Goragg no matter 
               what. </p>

             <p><b><a name="LGuk1">Lower Guk (undead side) revisited</a></b>
             </p><p>On December 13, a group of 6 GOT members (Goragg 51 monk, Wien 
               46 Ranger, Akaver 43 Chanter, Keldora 43 Chanter, Zrax 47 Cleric 
               and Irezz 40 Cleric) had a blast in LGuk undead side. The group 
               was good. That is an understatement. The group was AMAZING! Can 
               you imagine the support that 2 chanters and 2 Clerics can provide 
               to a Ranger and a Monk! We owned the zone, 6 out of 8 camps I believe! 
               we got few good items, and an extra mantle (9ac, 7wis) that we are 
               saving to Griderwaldf in case he needs it! We stayed about 2.5 hours, 
               Wien never crashed and most gained 2 yellow bubs, except Goragg, 
               who is in a bad hell level. Thanks for all who joined, and I wish 
               many more can organize similar outings and have fun. </p>

             </b>In a follow up to our Lower Guk adventures, 9 hardy adventurers 
             from our guild visited the mysterious City of Mist on Sunday, Nov. 
             11th. It was an interesting but sometimes hair raising adventure due 
             to 3-4 mob pulls. Sae helped nuke and provide extensive support and 
             our thanks go out to him. Good experience was gained by everyone and 
             we even got some ruined scale armor for the lower members of the guild.
