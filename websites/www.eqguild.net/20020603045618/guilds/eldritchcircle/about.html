		<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">We are a round table society, made up of a diverse mix of people - our characters have unearthly and magical skills (or maybe we're all just strange!), hence 'Eldritch Circle'.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">As to our purpose, we are a guild on the Antonius Bayle server in the online game Everquest. We serve as a place for kindred spirits to join together to find people to group with, help with quests, and shared resources to make use of and to contribute to (tradeskills, pooled quest items etc).<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Our overriding beliefs are that we are here to have fun, and to help each other. A member of a guild is useful only when they pool their resources for the benefit of all, rather than being out for all they can get.<br>
