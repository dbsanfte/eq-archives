 <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Shinsengo,
 or “Shin” as his friends call him, was an orphan raised by the Freeport
 Monks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rumor has it that his Father
 died before he was born, and that when his mother grew ill, she had entrusted
 the infant to a wize old Monk named Kenetsu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>Shin’s early years training with the monks were happy ones.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their way of life was calm, peacefull, and
 without the everyday worries that come with owning many material
 possessions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Though they were powerful
 fighters, the monks never went out of their way to start any major
 conflicts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Their combat training
 missions consisted mostly of keeping the Wild Animals of The Desert and
 Commonlands under control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By fighting
 Bears, Wolves, and Giant Beetles, the monks were helping the people while
 training and learning the ways of nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>Little did Shin know that it would be one of these missions that would
 change his life forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
 
 <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>It was a cool
 October evening when it happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A
 party of ten monks, including Shin and the aging Kenetsu had left the safety of
 Freeport to help the people of the Commonlands rid themselves of a hungry pack
 of lions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It would be an easy
 mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A party of ten monks was
 overkill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of the monks could solo
 multiple lions at a time by now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
 seemed that the leader of the group, Kroten, just wanted to make a spectacle of
 the monk guild’s power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After an hour
 or two of walking, the monks arrived at a small cottage.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The lions had been seen here often and a
 young ranger had tracked the pack to this area.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>They were all sure that they would encounter the lions that
 night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of the monks gathered and
 overcrowded the small cottage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
 owners of the cottage, a poor family of five, made the monks as comfortable as
 they could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Blankets, a full dinner,
 and even some fine ale put the monks into a relaxed mood.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kenetsu made a comment to Shin about the
 monks growing soft and lazy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was
 a small argument between Kenetsu and Kroten resulting in Kenetsu taking Shin
 outside with him to camp there and be on the lookout for the lions.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a few hours of listening to Kenetsu
 talk about his youth, and what it was to be honorable and just, the young Shin
 fell into a deep sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He didn’t see
 why he had to be stuck with the boring, long winded mentor.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But he had to admit, Kenetsu was a great
 man, and was well liked and respected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>Althought the youth would never admitt it, he loved his foster father
 deeply.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
 
 <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>It was probably
 around 2 AM when Shin awoke to the sound of more arguing between Kroten and
 Kenetsu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Great!” Shinsengo
 thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I’ll probably be sleeping in
 the lions den with twice the lecturing after this one!!”<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shin soon learned that they weren’t arguing
 about being lazy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Apparently the 5 year
 old son of the poor farmer had dissappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>He had last been seen by some of the monks heading in the direction of
 the dreaded Orc Camp and the monks had been too drunk and/or lazy to do
 anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“How was I to know?” Kroten
 was saying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I figured the kid couldn’t
 sleep and was going off to play a little.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>What Kroten didn’t mention was the fact that the kid had been angered by
 the monks who were stealing what little food they had.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He had gathered up some supplies, and his
 favorite wooden sword, and taken to the woods so he could take care of the
 lions himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Damn You!!” Kenetsu
 Shouted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Someone send a message to the
 ranger staying in the inn down the road!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>We need to track that kid down before something terrible happens!”<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the monks immediately ran off in the
 direction of the inn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kroten had failed
 and Kenetsu was taking over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I won’t
 waste your skills by sending you stumbling blindly through the commonlands
 brothers, but I can’t sit here and wait for the ranger.” Kenetsu said.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Shin and I will go up ahead and see if we
 can find him.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Normally Kenetsu
 wouldn’t want to take Shin on a mission like this, but he knew that Shin
 wouldn’t stay behind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shin was learning
 to sneak around danger quite stealthily anyways.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>Kenetsu and Shin took to the woods with very little equipment to
 slow them down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Now do you see what I
 was talking about?” Kenetsu was saying as they jogged through the woods.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“I hope you don’t forget this.”<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
 
 <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>The two had been
 wandering the woods for over an hour when Shin started to lose hope.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Maybe the ranger had already found him.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They could head back to the cottage and
 check in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was then that Kenetsu
 caught the light of the Orc camp fires..<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>The two crept closer to get a better look.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>There, in the fire light, a group of Orc Legionaries were
 grouped, engaged in some kind of game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>Looking to the center of the group, Shin saw the game, and began shaking
 with fear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The giant orcs were
 surrounding and tormenting the courageous young boy of five.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The young boy was crying and trying
 desperately to defend himself with his pitiful wooden sword.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The site made Shin sick to his stomach, and
 was near tears himself seeing the young boy and his pitiful sword.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Picturing the boys horrible death made him
 want to die himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shin was brought
 back to his senses by a low moan of anger to his left.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kenetsu dropped his pouch and turned to
 Shinsengo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“No matter what happens,
 don’t go down there unless I say to!” he whispered harshly to Shin, his face
 like death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was all Shin could do to
 nod, still seized with fear from his hiding place in the hills.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
 
 <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>Kenetsu darted
 forward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He moved with inhuman speed,
 glowing with a magical Ki.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shin never
 thought that this elderly monk still had so much strength in him.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This was the power that the monks had always
 told him about, but he had never witnessed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>Kenetsu swept down upon them so fast that they never saw it coming.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He lept high into the air and slammed the
 leader with a solid flying kick to the chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>The leader flew back, crashing through the fire.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The orc finally rolled to a stop,<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>laying face down in the dirt, dead.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other orcs, recovering from their
 innitial shock, rushed forward in a furious rage.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>Kenetsu dodged the axe of the first attacker, and caught him with
 a four hit combo that left him unconsious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>Just as the third Orc reached him, Konetsu met him with a furious Dragon
 Punch, ending the orcs life before he hit the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>Kenetsu landed, and turned to face the fourth Orc.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Get that boy out of here!!” Kenetsu yelled
 as he grappled with the Orc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shin
 snapped to his senses and ran towards the boy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>He grabbed the weeping child by the collar and began dragging him back
 up the hill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Though Shinsengo was only
 11 years old himself, he was still incredibly strong.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>Kenetsu swept the Orc to the ground and prepared to land the
 finishing blow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just as he prepared to
 strike the Orc, Kenetsu felt a blade of cold steel slide through him from the
 back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shinsengo watched as Kenetsu fell
 to his knees and was slaughtered by the remaining Orcs.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>
 
 <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>Shin couldn’t
 believe what he was seeing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kenetsu had
 raised him lovingly as his own son.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How
 could he be killed by an ordinary Orc Legionarie?<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>Shin got his answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>Through the corner of his eye, he caught sight of a dark elf, smiling to
 himself in the shadows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Orc was
 glowing with a dark aura.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Dark Elf
 had obviously empowered the Orc with his own dark magic.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shinsengo rushed forward.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He knew he was as good as dead, but he was
 going to die fighting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was not even
 ½ way there when a magical arrow flew over his head.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>It implanted itself deep into the Orcs chest.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The monks, aided by the ranger, swept down
 on the camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They killed all the Orcs
 swiftly, and knocked over the tents and bunks looking for any more that may be
 around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When Shin looked back for the
 Dark Elf, he was gone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The monks
 probably wouldn’t even believe him if he told them what he had seen.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Shin stumbled into the camp, overcome with
 shock and grief.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kroten was standing
 over Kenetsu’s body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Poor Guy..”<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kroten said.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>“But it was his own damn fault.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>Shin couldn’t take it anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>He flew at Kroten, landing a roundkick to the monk’s midsection.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The monk doubled over, and Shin pounded him,
 splitting his lip, and knocking him back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
 </span>Kroten recovered and threw a swift Eagle Strike, bringing Shin to his
 knees and making him choke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Kroten lept
 forward to strike again, but the other monks pulled him back.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ranger put the tip of his sword to
 Kroten’s throat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“Leave him alone, or
 I’ll lay you next to Konetsu!” The ranger threatened.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>When they turned back to look for Shinsengo, he was already
 gone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He fled through the woods back to
 Freeport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But he wouldn’t go back to
 the monks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He had seen and heard enough
 of them to last a lifetime..</p>
 
 <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'>It was the night
 that Kenetsu died that Shinsengo had his vision.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>His foster father’s death had given him a new drive and
 commitment to make a difference in the world, and not<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>just sit around like the monks of his guild.<span
 style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He dreamed of one day riding at the head of
 a Legion of true warriors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This Legion
 would be dedicated to each other, and work as a unit.<span style="mso-spacerun:
 yes">  </span>They would grow in power together, and they would be feared and
 respected thoughout all of Norrath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And
 thus begins the story of <b>The Dread Legions</b>…<span style="mso-spacerun:
