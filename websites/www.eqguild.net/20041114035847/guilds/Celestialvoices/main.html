<p><font size"5">Spread all across the great lands of norath, the Celestial Voices have band together on the Quellious server to spread a message of hope into the lives of all who are in dispare.  Headed up by our great leader, Aatlaen Koolbreeze, we vow to do our best to do our best to hel anyone in need within the boundries of fairness.  Comprised of all races and classes, we blend our talents together to form a guild which very well could become the leading guild in time....

<p><hr>
<p>We the members of Celestial Voices follow rules set up in order to make the game fun and fair fir everyone.  The Rules set up among the officers are as follows:
<p>
<p><font color="blue">
1.   All members will help anyone in need where ever and whenever possible.  This does not mean that you should give away items or money, but that you should HELP.
<BR>

<BR>
2.  All members will save any other player from death, save throwing themselves to certain death as well.
<BR>

<BR>
3.  Any member caught KS'ing any other player WILL be removed immediately, regardless of whether that player was KS'ing you first.
<BR>

<BR>
4.  All members will attend one of the bi-monthly meetings.  The purpose of these meetings are to recognize the great deeds of our fellow guild members and to build overall fellowship between all those in the guild.  Also amendments to the guild rules will be voted on by the membership at the meetings and the result of this popular vote will determine if the new rules take effect or if they are discarded.  Take an active role in your guild.
<BR>

<BR>
5.  All promotions to be given will be givin at the bi-monthly meetings, no information regarding these promotions will be released before such time so don't ask, we won't tell you.
<BR>

<BR>
6.  NO BEGGING.  Nuff said.
<BR>

<BR>
7.  No member will be removed from the guild without a hearing between that member, the Officers of the squad that member belongs to, and either the General or the Commander.  This hearing will be face to face in a location designated by either the General or the Commander, but will never take place in a Zone that may cause the death of said member.
<BR>

<BR>
8.  All officers may invite new members into the guild, however only Majors, the General, or the Commander may run guild events (ie. raids, contests etc).  Feel free to suggest a potential event to your Major, the General, or the Commander.
<BR>

<BR>
9.  All candidates for Membership must be sponsored by an existing member in good standing and must be invited by either a captain or major of the Squad that they will be a part of, or by the general or commander.  It is your duty to sponsor any traveler that you feel would make a valuable addition to our ranks. 
<BR>

<BR>
10. Any officer found not to be abiding by the rules and regualtions of the guild will be stripped of the position and placed on a 30 day probationary period.  The position left open will be filled by one who might better serve the guild.  This is to ensure that officers lead by example and do not take their position for granted.  It is your duty to report ANY member who is not following the guild rules regardless of their position.
<BR>

<BR>
11. Have fun in whatever you do in Norrath.
