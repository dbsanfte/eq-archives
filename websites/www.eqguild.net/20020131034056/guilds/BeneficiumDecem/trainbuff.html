 <center><h1>Train Buffing Days</h1></center>
 <br><br><b>You ask what does "Train Buffing" mean?</b><br><br>
 Train Buffing is when the guild gets together in a zone and Buffs pc's and if a
 train is brought to us, breaks the train.<br>
 <br><b>What does Train Buffing Day not mean?</b><br>
 <br>
 Well, we are not here for xp, loot, cash - we are here to buff other PC's and to
  create a good image for Beneficium Decem.  Also we are not here to do power
   leveling.<br>
 <br>
 
 <b>What are the recommended lvls for attending a TB day?</b><br>
 <br>
 Check the zone that is being TB'ed.  If you are below the minimum lvl for the 
 zone, I would reconsider attending.  There will be other TB's that you will have
  the levels to attend.<br>
 <br><b>What if my class can not buff?</b><br>
 <br>
 Come anyway, tanks can help protect those of us that are doing buffs, break any
 trains that come our way and represent the guild.  Rogues can help recover corpses from difficult areas.
 <br><br>
 
 <b>How long does Train Buffing Day last?</b><br>
 <br>
 Usually TB's will last about 2 to 4 hours, but Guildmembers may hang out at the
 TB site longer.<br>
 <br>
 <br><b>When is the next Train Buff Day?</b><br>
 <br>
 Check the link below for a calendar of when we are planning TB's.
