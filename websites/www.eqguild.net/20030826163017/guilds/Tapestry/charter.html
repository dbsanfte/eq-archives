  Golden Rule</font></font></u></i></b><br>
               <font color="#ffcc00"><font size="+2">1)&nbsp; All members must
   uphold the reputation of the Guild at all times.&nbsp; This includes helping
   people if it does not endanger you.&nbsp; It also includes not harming anyone 
   in any way.&nbsp; We are a good Guild and will not have ANYONE ruining our
   reputation.</font></font>             
              <p><font color="#c0c0c0"><font size="+2">2)&nbsp; All Meetings
   are mandatory.&nbsp; If you have a valid reason for not being able to make
   it (i.e. on your deathbed, work, hottest date ever, etc.), please let Lore
   Master or Guild Leader know at least two (2) days ahead of time, or within 
  (2) days after missing.</font></font></p>
               
              <p><font color="#c0c0c0"><font size="+2">3)&nbsp; All members
   are expected to not use the /anon flag, as this removes the Guild tag from
   behind your name.&nbsp; Wear the Tapestry of Heroes flag proudly.&nbsp;
  If  you wish to hide your level, class and race, use the /roleplay command
  instead.</font></font></p>
               
              <p><font color="#c0c0c0"><font size="+2">4)&nbsp; Your alts,

              <p><font color="#c0c0c0"><font size="+2">6) Respect your fellow
   Guild members by not spamming the Guild chat with things that you do not
  want them to see, or they would not want to see.&nbsp; Use /tell, /group,
  or /say to keep the Guild chat from being cluttered with local issues or
  "off color" talk.&nbsp; We have younger members that don't need to hear about
  things you wouldn't tell them in front of their mothers.</font></font></p>
