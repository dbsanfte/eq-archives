<P>Good day to you friend. The following is a general outline of what I wish to
accomplish with our Guild as well as the Charter and
<A HREF="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=6213">current member
list</A>. I plan on running this Guild to the best of my ability. I want our
Guild to be known and respected throughout Norrath. I will always try to be
readily available for my Guildmates and I'd ask that we all would do the same.
As a Guild we shall eventually be going on raids, as well as possibly
challenging some other Guilds to a war. It will be some time before we do these
things because I wish for us to become a little more established first. I ask
that you bear with me and if you have any suggestions don't be afraid to make
them known. You shall find out that I am willing to work with everyone to make
this Guild like our gaming family. The following is our Guild Charter.</P>
<P> We, The members of Autumn's Twilight, Wish to work together in achieving
the following goals:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Firstly, We shall always work together to uphold all that is good in the
lands of Norrath.<BR>
</LI>
<LI>Secondly, We shall always be prepared to help those in need, around us.
</LI>
<LI>Last, As we grow in number, intellect, strength, and wisdom, We shall be
prepared to thwart all that is foul and evil throughout Norrath.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Cyriana Autumn - Guild Leader </P>
