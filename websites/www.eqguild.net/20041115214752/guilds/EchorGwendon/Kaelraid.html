<P><font size="4">Kael Raid, 25th of May 2003</font>
<P>First Kael raid by Echor Gwendon lead by Scythia.  Diocletian, Yirrlaar, Phalgor, Ndretti and Kindra completed the full group exploration into Kael.  The group made it to the entrance to the arena and camped the giants in that area.  Yirrlaar maxed out his CoV faction and one item of value did drop (placed in the guildbank).  The last mob was a named mob that came from the rear of the group and it went down without any problem.  No deaths occurred.  Raid was only under 2 hours in length but the group gained invaluable experience about Kael.
