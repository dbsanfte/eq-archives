Fallen Heroes

<br><br><br>

Wading across the bloody pools<br>
The warrior stalks his prey<br>
Bodies littered, weapons and tools<br>
Soon he will enter into this fray<br><br>

Stink of death wafts to his nose<br>
He grits his teeth and grips his blade<br>
He sets solid steps with his toes<br>
The coming fight in his mind played<br><br>

A slash, a thrust, a chop, he swings<br>
Scream of pain, blood comes spurt<br>
The warrior, in his dance will sing<br>
The song of vengeance to those who hurt<br><br>

Familes lost, friends have fell<br>
Revenge is sweet, but cannot heal<br>
Down the ravine, across the dell<br>
No longer human, he does not feel<br><br>

Filled with hate, angered to fight<br>
Blood, sweat, muscle, bone<br>
Into the darkness, pass the light<br>
He prays to find comrades and be no longer alone<br><br>

With a cry, a arrow finds him<br>
Quivering in his chest with pain<br>
A smile upon his lips, eyes going dim<br>
A fallen hero, his enemy's bane<br><br><br>
