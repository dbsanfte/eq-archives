        Silent Blade of Norrath would like to invite you all to a party in honor of our new recruits! This will be held on Sunday at 5pm EST near the druid ring in Steamfont Mountains. Please come and join us in our brave attempt at hurdling innocent gnomes whilst the room is spinning! <br> <br>Following that, we'll be heading to nearby Lesser Faydark to rid the place of the Teir Dal Elite. They've been hassling the locals, and need a kick in the pants... Also, our rangers inform us that a few bandits have set up camp nearby, so younger folks might be able to join in on the fun after all! <br> <br>Sorry we've been slacking in the event dept as of late... To be truthful, most of us haven't been around much recently. But personally, I know I can eventually convince my boss how importand it is for me to spend tons of time in EQ, and how it can enhance my performance at work... <br> <br>Yeah, right! <br> <br>Have a great weekend Wolf Den! See ya on Sunday! <br>
