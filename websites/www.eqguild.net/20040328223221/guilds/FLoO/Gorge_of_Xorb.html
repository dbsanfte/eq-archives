Having recently completed a very succesful exploration of the ruins of <A HREF="http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/FLoO/Befallen.html">Befallen</A>, the Foreign Legion searched for a more formidable opponent.  Thus we headed to the minotaur infested chasms and valleys of Beholder's Maze.  The following were in attendance:
<p>
Adanya
<br>
Adenia
<br>
Aegnar
<br>
Arrythmia
<br>
Cinamun
<br>
Eronus
<br>
Gaereth
<br>
Ishtarrak
<br>
Khirseth
<br>
Liwanu
<br>
General Pallidmortis
<br>
Syscrusher
<br>
Yannik
<p>

After getting bored with the trivial task of slaying Muddites and Minotaurs, our force headed to the throne area of King Xorb.  Here we encountered a little more challenge with the Evil Eyes and unfortunately had to dispose of Liwanu's pet as it was charmed and atacking the group.

Here was the goal.  Unfortunately, there were some named eye balls floating between us and the throne.

The General takes matters into his own hands.  Careful, you will put an eye out!

It did not take long and the enemy was vanquished.
