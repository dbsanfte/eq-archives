         </blockquote>
 		<blockquote>
 			<p><small><font face="Century Gothic" color="#FFFFFF">TBP is TSW's point based allocation system for loot. The necessary points are described below:
<p>
1. Every guild raid attended by a member will be said to be worth 1 point. A guild raid is defined as a coordinated effort by 3+ groups of people (18 or more).
<p>
2. The points are stored in a seperate forum on the guild messageboard. Members can view their total points in this forum, and post for corrections where they think appropriate. It is the members responsibility to know how many points they have.
<p>
3. Every item dropped on a guild raid will be assigned a point value, the majority of which will be pre-defined in the database, and also kept track of in the TBP forum. Members can then view this list as they wish. Members are also encouraged to check up on the stats of items they are interested in, in advance.
<p>
4. To be in for a lotto you must have points equal or higher than the item cost. If noone with enough points want the item a member that want it can roll for it and go negative points. No member with 0 or less points can roll for any items. If noone still want the item we either bank the item if MQable or not no drop or lower the point cost for no drop items.
<p>
5. Maximum points allowed to roll with on any item will be 40, even if the member have more than this.
<p>
6. If a member wins a 10 point item, the database will be updated and the member will have 10 points less than prior to gaining the item. This takes effect immidiatly.
<p>
7. Every member is only allowed to win 1 (one) item in any single raid or any single day. The only exception to this are tertiary items which drop on the way to a Target, which when announced will be handled seperatly from the Target's drops. 
<p>
8. Drops are defined in 3 categories. General items are handled by straight point based rolls with the above requirements in effect. Quest and Epic items will cost points, but their allocation is decided by GL/Officers generally in advance. ST keys are seperate again and currently slated for 12 people who will form the core group for ST. The keys will be lottoed between those 12, if they have the points till all have keys. Then, the keys will become General items to the point of anyone can roll with the required points, as long as they are lvl60 and have been in TSW for 6 months.
<p>
9. Loot officers call out the item with stats and how many points the item is worth. The members that can use it and want it then tell the officer how many points he have. The officer can check if its right by checking the database. The officer will then calculate the max roll and let the members roll. The item will be announced 3 times so that every member sees it. When rolls are completed, an officer will check the winners roll does coincide with the number on the webpage. Where a member has given their points incorrectly, they will be deducted upto 10 points.
<p>
10. Members not participating in the current event or are VERY late are not allowed to roll on the items.
<p>
11. Quest and Epic encounters that require 3+ groups will cost points to initiate. Contact an officer to discuss this.
<p>
12. Maximum of the roll will be calculated like this: Random X*10 to (Y*10)+100, where X is your points and Y is the points from the member with the highest points participating in the roll. 
<p>
Example:
<p>
We kill CT and brain of CT drops, it costs 10 points. Roydal, Jayk, Darkivy and Rezam are the only members that wants the item.
<p>
Roydal got 45 points<br>
Rezam got 20 points<br>
Darkivy got 10 points<br>
Jayk got 5 points<br>
<p>
Darkform doesnt have enough points and are not allowed to roll for the item.
<p>
Max roll is determined from Roydals points (45) because he have most, but no more than 40 are allowed to roll with. The 3 remaining will then roll:
<p>
Roydal: /random 400 500<br>
Rezam: /random 200 500<br>
Darkivy: /random 100 500<br>
<p>
Everyone can win this roll, but Roydal have been to most events and got the most points so he have the biggest chance to win the item. Roydal is unlucky though and rezam win the item. So in the database after the raid we will have the following points, included the point from participation in the event:
<p>
Roydal 46 points<Br>
Rezam 11 points<br>
Darkivy 11 points<br>
Jayk 6 points<br>
<p>
13. Prospective members with a probationary tag do not earn any points nor can roll on an item, unless it is going to rott. Once a probationary member becomes a full member, they can start earning points and rolling on items. 
<p>
14. In the interests of equipping MTs to be the taunt machines the guild needs, they will be given first refusal on certain items - in cases where this will occur, it will be announced before hand.

 		<blockquote>
 			<p><small><font face="Century Gothic" color="#FFFFFF">
 			To apply for membership in The Silent Watch, you need the following.<br><br>
 
 			Have a sponsor within the guild<br>
 			Minimum level to join TSW is 58<br>
 			Have sufficient resist gear +100 in all resists unbuffed<br>
 			Seb Key <br><br>
 
 			Application Process<br><br>
 
 			It is wise not to be guilded while you apply for membership in TSW. If you meet the above 
 			requirements then you can post in 'Applying to join' forum and your application will be 
 			moved to the private section of our message board for consideration from our members. 
 			Prior to this an interview with the recruiting officer and class leader will be arranged. 
 			In the period of one month you need to gather 15 positive votes, we strongly suggest to 
 			group with TSW members so that will get to know you and you know them. Also you can contact 
 			your sponsor to find information about upcoming events and raids. If you have any negative 
 			votes during that period we will look into the situation and extend the evaluation period 
 			if needed. If your application is rejected you can re-apply after the period of two months.
 			<br><br>
 			Probation and Loot<br><br>
 
 			Once you are invited you will have a probationary status for two weeks. GL and Officers will 
 			be able to evaluate your overall contribution to the guild. During this period as a probationary member you are not entitled to roll on any item that drops on a guild raid.  It is a time to prove instead that you want to be a part of the guild. 
 			The goal of your probationary month is to asses whether you are a helpful member of not - if you 
 			do not help others, no one will help you, after all. At the end of this one month probationary 
 			status you will be considered a Full Member or rejected. 
 			<br><br>
 			Special cases may apply and an applicant will be considered without having to go through the 
 			full application process, this is up to Council.
 			<br><br>
 			Alternative Characters
 			<br><br>
 			When your main character is guilded you are allowed a maximum of 2 alternative characters guilded. 
 			However, remember that we guilded your main for a specific reason, we don’t need your alts. 
 			For those with dual accounts, you still have one main only, and loot is allocated as such.
