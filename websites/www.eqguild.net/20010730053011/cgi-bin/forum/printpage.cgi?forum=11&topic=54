        After sending out a couple of mass mailings lately, it occurs to me that I don't have everyone's email address. &nbsp;Please email me at Lilla@eqguild.net so I can add you to the guild address book so I can keep you informed on the happenings with the guild. <br> <br>If you'd like your email address to stay anonymous, please feel free to set up a specific email address strictly for guild related information. &nbsp;EQguild.net is a great place to get that done. &nbsp; <br> <br>Since I've found the need to mass mail everyone a couple of times lately, I'd ask that if you aren't sure if I have your email address, please email me today!! <br> <br>For those of you reading this, please pass along to people in game to check the boards. <br> <br>Thanks :D
