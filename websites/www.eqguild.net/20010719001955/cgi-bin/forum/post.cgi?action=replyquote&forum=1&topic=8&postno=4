 &nbsp; Well, I have read as much as I can about this plague on the plains of Karana, and it seems there is more going on then just this plague. &nbsp;It seems that on some servers, that Firionia Vie, as well as Innorak's daughter has been spoted, and lots of unusual events are taking place in the lands of Norrath.
 &nbsp; The plague of Karana started as this:
Mordavin Telase, husband of Azibelle Spavin was hung by (under orders from) Antonius Bayle for conspiracy. &nbsp;Apparently Mordavin was conducting research for Bertoxx (the god of plagues), as well. &nbsp;Well, Azibelle got a bunch of people together and did a ceremony and called on Bertoxx to come to the Karana's. &nbsp;He did. &nbsp;He announced things to the whole zone about how he was going to &quot;bless the land&quot; with three things, the green mist that comes during the rains, the rabid animails, and the swarmlings (who sometimes spawn with a Mother, who cons red to a level 30), and the Karanas have never been the same since. &nbsp;If you talk with the farmers in the Karana's, they will tell you this story.
 &nbsp; i suggest that if you are interested in finding out more, to check out this website. &nbsp;www.1fol.cjb.net &nbsp;on their message boards there is a board called &nbsp;(something like) We are at WAR and HERE is all the Info. &nbsp;Warning, it is VERY long, and indepth...lots about the details of the History of the lands of Norrath. &nbsp;There are over 13 pages of posts there, so make sure you have some time to read them.
 &nbsp;Anyway, hope that helps a bit! &nbsp;

He says there was a zone wide message saying that Bertox the god had trapped/enslaved/imprisoned gods to &nbsp;his plane (of Disease)  <br> Now the theory going about higher up &nbsp;is that since most GMs themselves are going to nk and &nbsp;do not know &nbsp;whats going on, meaning it's some VI &nbsp;event and not &nbsp;a GM event, that perhaps VI are about to open a new planes called (maybe) Plane of Disease. /shrug <br> <br>Sounds possible but who really knows.All I know is that &nbsp;any GM's I spoke to say they dont know whats happening and &nbsp;they then port into NK to see for themselves lol. <br> <br>I got me 51st Warrior ready to go at a moments notice no matter what happens lol.
