<h1 align="center">History of The Phoenix<br>
--Written by: Yeech Gudtolli</h1>




<p><img align="left" src="images/other/FIRSTA_1.jpg" width="252" height="180" border="0">When The Nameless One created the universe, many forms of sentient beings were created. Some of
which would be called Gods. But The Nameless One created other creatures as well, creatures not of the body but of the soul and of the mind that a universe of strife might form a whole. The Golden
Phoenix was one of those creatures. A creature of the flame of renewal, friendship and honor. Its ability to bring diverse souls together was an irritant to many powers of the universe. For the many
are stronger than the one. These powers felt that the universe was theirs to do with as they pleased, and that The Golden Phoenix was an obstacle to their desires. It was decided to dispatch The
Midnight Serpent, a creature of destruction, hate and misunderstanding, to destroy once and for all The Golden Phoenix. When The Golden Phoenix and The Midnight Serpent met, the cosmos feel to a
hush. The Golden Phoenix never making a move to defend itself, smiled and said " I forgive you" The Midnight Serpent, fangs dripping with gloom,ever eager for destruction sprang forward to rend The
Golden Phoenix from limb to limb, particle from particle, until nothing but minute sparks blinked among the firmament. With contempt The Midnight Serpent swirled through the sparks, scattering the
last of The Golden Phoenix into the spaces between the stars. Each spark, no longer part of the whole, alone, a creature of the soul flame. To late The Midnight Serpent senses that ultimate victory
is not his, and seeks out each of the sparks, to be totally consumed into everlasting darkness. Yet some sparks escaped the maw of The Midnight Serpent.
<p>
At last one of these sparks falls  upon a barren world devoid of all life,all hope. all fellowship, the world of Norrath. When Veeshan came to Norrath she did not know that she was the first to
awaken the spark that was but one part of The Golden Phoenix. As life on Norrath grew and multiplied, the spark that is part of The Golden Phoenix grew until the flame shown bright in many, from all
races and creeds. a flame so bright that it would burn the differences to meaningless embers. In every age the flame that is The Golden Phoenix has burned a little brighter and brought those who feel
its pull together into family. And so in this age,the age of renewal,the age of wonder,the flame of The Golden Phoenix has brought together all those who felt the stirrings within their hearts.
Feeling the tug since birth when only the spark stirred them,yet over time their deeds fanned this spark into flames. Together they formed the guild Golden Phoenix perhaps not understanding with the
mind, but with the soul and heart. And so it comes to pass, once again is born The Golden Phoenix. Yet this rebirth is not complete. Gloom, despair, and misunderstanding all aspects of The Midnight
Serpent seeks to slide into our hearts, to eat the sparks that escaped him so long ago, and achieve his ultimate victory. As long as The Golden Phoenix guild lives, victory for The Midnight Serpent
will never be, and each day he grows weaker. The flame that is the guild Golden Phoenix grows brighter each time another is enriched. By living the guild creed, those who behold it in your actions
and sense it in your hearts, find that the spark in their hearts grows a little brighter and The Midnight Serpent recoils. In your darkest moments, with no sun to warm you, when the wane light of the
moon does not shine, and there are no stars to guide your way, you will know that the flame in your heart reaches out to all the other flames of The Golden Phoenix in the world, across space and
reality. Then you do not walk alone, that we are one, we are The Golden Phoenix!
