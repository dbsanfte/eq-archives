		<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">We are using GuildMagic to keep track of our members. You are responsible for signing up for the guild and keeping your character information current.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">A <a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/guild_characters.cfm?ID=4290" target="_top">list of Eldritch Circle members</a> is available here.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Since several people have had problems signing on and creating accounts, here is a step-by-step guide to the process:<br>
				<br>
			</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Go to <a href="http://www.guildmagic.com/create_user.cfm" target="_top">http://www.guildmagic.com/create_user.cfm</a><br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Create your private account by entering a username, password and timezone. You can use this account anytime to update your character skills, level, etc.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">You will be taken to a login screen where you need to log in with the usename and password you just created.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Go to add guilds to my user and select our guild<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Create a new character. You can also create alternative characters that are in the guild.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Once the guild admin approves the character application, your character will be listed in the guild. Please don't panic if you don't see your character on the roster immediately.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">If you have any further questions about the guildmagic system, please read their FAQ at: <a href="http://eq.guildmagic.com/faq.cfm" target="_top">http://eq.guildmagic.com/faq.cfm</a><br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Please keep your character information updated regularly.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">If you are having problems logging in or creating characters, read the statement below. If you have other questions that are not answered in the Guild magic FAQ above, please ask on the <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/bguildmagic" target="_top">GuildMagic EZboard forums</a>, failing that, ask us on the <a href="forum.html" target="_self">Eldritch Circle web forum</a>.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Please be aware that guildmagic is experiencing some ISP problems right now. You may have difficulties in creating or updating your character or creating an account until the problems are fixed. If you can not create or update your character, please try using Netscape to do it. I don't know why, but it works better for some people. Please give it a try and don't give up. If the network is busy please try to log on at an off-peak time and try again. I know it isn't perfect but it is the only service out there that lets individual users update their own content rather than relying on the guild webhead to coordinate with everyone in the guild to keep a webpage updated. Thank you for your patience.<br>
