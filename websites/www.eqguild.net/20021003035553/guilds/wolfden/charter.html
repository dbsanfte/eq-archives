              energy it takes to help others. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--Be sure to be respectful 
              to those around us. Please and Thank You go a long way. If one feels 
              the need to ask for help, and the person you're requesting help 
              from appears to be busy doing other things or expresses the desire 
              not to help for whatever reason, thank them for their time and then 
              find your own way. DO NOT pester someone who has already told you 
              they can't help for whatever reason. </font></p>

              help, there are those who may consider joining us for ulterior motives. 
              Therefore, all new members will be in a probation period for two 
              weeks. During that time, it will give us all a chance to see if 
              the prospective member is the right fit for us, as well as give 
              the new member a chance to see if the Den is right for them. </font></p>

              to become a part of the Wolf Den, one must be recommended into the 
              guild. The best way for that to happen is to make a friend and be

              players are also subject to these supplementary rules while playing 
              EverQuest. While by no means an all-inclusive list of the do's and 
              don'ts in EverQuest, it provides a suitable foundation by which 
              the player can determine what activities are appropriate: </p>

              <font color="#FF0000"><b>1.</b></font> <b><font color="#000000">You 
              may not steal kills.</font></b><br>
              Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason 
              that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without 
              that group's specific permission.<br>
              The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual 
              Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together 
              or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest 
              Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy. </p>
            <p><br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><b>2.</b></font> <b><font color="#000000">You 
              may not ninjaloot.</font></b><br>
              Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen 
              creature without the express permission of those who killed the 
              creature if they are in attendance.<br>
              The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures 
              that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to 
              it being looted by the rightful owner.</p>
            <p><br>

              must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.</font></b><br>
              There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing. 
              In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. If an equitable 
              compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest 
              Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a binding 
              compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by an EQCSR 
              will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested 
              that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they 
              can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise 
              that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise 
              would.<br>
              Note: A "group" in this case is defined as a party of

              Excessive use of foul language in an inappropriate context, including 
              swear words, real-world racial slurs, and other language that is 
              not consistent with the fantasy environment and designed to hurt,

              guidelines, <b><font color="#000000">you may not harass other players.</font></b><br>
              Harassment is defined as specifically targeting another player or 
              group of players to harm or inconvenience them. Harassment can take 
              many forms, as it goes to the state-of-mind of the person or party 
              on the receiving end of the action. However, in order to account 
              for those who are excessively thin-skinned, the EQCSR involved will 
              make a determination as to whether or not the average person would 
              feel "harassed" and act accordingly.</p>
            <p><br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><b>6.</b></font> <b><font color="#000000">You 
              may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.</font></b><br>
              Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm 
              or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player 
              or group of players. <b>This includes things such as:</b><br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><b>o</b></font> <b>Monopolizing most or all 
              of the kills in an area. </b><br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><b>o</b></font> <b>Deliberately blocking a 
              doorway or narrow area so other players cannot get past. </b><br>

              Fraud in all transactions between players will result in disciplinary 
              action when confirmed by an internal EQCSR. Fraud is defined as 
              falsely representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's 
              expense. Examples of this activity include but are not limited to 
              offering to drag the corpse of another player to safety but instead 
              hiding it deeper in the dungeon as well as using flaws in a secure 
              trade window to deprive someone of one of their items.</p>
            <p><br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><b>8.</b></font> <b>You may not operate a 
              guild that habitually violates these rules.</b><br>
              Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a 
              broader basis. Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the 
              Rules of Conduct or Play Nice Policies may be disbanded. In addition, 
              monopolizing numerous spawn areas with the intent to exclude other 
              players will not be permitted. If investigated and verified by an 
              internal EQCSR, monopolizing will result in the disbanding of the 
              guild.</p>
            <p><br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><b>9.</b></font> <b>You may not intentionally

              them.</b><br>
              Training is defined as pulling an NPC along behind you and attempting 
              to get it to attack another player who does not desire that engagement.<br>
              The intentional training of NPCs will result in immediate disciplinary 
              action when witnessed by an EQCSR. We are aware that accidents often 
              happen causing unintentional trains, and will scrutinize each report 
              of this activity closely.</p>

              Though some of these actions are covered in part by other rules, 
              they deserve their own note here. The following things would be 
              considered an "abuse" in game:<br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><b>o</b></font> <b>Hate Mongering - participation

              wrongdoing without basis for it. </b><br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><b>o</b></font> <b>Impersonating a Customer

              <font color="#FF0000"><b>o</b></font> <b>Using Threats of Retribution 
              by GM Friends - attempting to convince another player that they

              does not grant license to violate these rules.</b><br>
              Though EverQuest is a Role-playing game, the claim of "Role-play" 
              will not be accepted in defense of any of the anti-social behaviors 
              mentioned above. As an example, you are in no case (PvP or otherwise) 
              allowed to "Train" a guard onto an enemy in protection 
              of your homeland. In another example, a rogue is not allowed to 
              steal someone's corpse under the guise of role-playing a thief.<br>
              By all means we want to encourage you to play your role, we just 
              cannot allow that role-play to be done at another's out-of-game 
              expense.</p>

              <font color="#FF0000"><b>1.2 </b></font><b>Special Rules Regarding 
              PvP Servers </b><br>
              The PvP Servers are a special case for many of the policies listed 
              here. When one makes the decision to play on a PvP Server, they 
              are in essence agreeing to play on a server where compromise is 
              decided on the basis of who has the power to kill whom.<br>
              By the same token, we expect that the people on those servers will 
              apply PvP combat in all situations where it is called for, as a 
              resolution to the problem. As such, the EverQuest Customer Service 
              Staff will decline to intervene in cases where a PvP alternative 
              exists, such as at disputed spawns where the parties involved have 
              the ability to attack each other.<br>
              Though the PvP environment does eliminate a few of the problems 
              experienced on the normal servers, there are a few more PvP-specific 
              problems that are created.</p>
            <p><br>
              <font color="#FF0000"><b><font color="#000000">Causing Experience 
              Loss</font></b></font><br>
              Intentionally causing experience-loss to other players in the PvP 
              environment is illegal in all cases and will result in a warning 
              when witnessed by an EQCSR. This includes things such as intentionally 
              training NPCs, and purposefully allowing an NPC to get the final 
              blow in combat. We do understand that there are cases where the 
              experience-loss is unintentional, and will take no action unless 
              a person earns a reputation of causing unintentional experience-loss.<br>
              Much like how the Kill Stealing rule applies to those on the blue 
              servers, this rule is designed to discourage and make note of those 
              who do it habitually, thus betraying the spirit of PvP. As a note, 
              the EQCSR will not in any case provide a resurrection for someone 
              who was caused experience loss in PvP, intentionally or otherwise. 
              This is one of the dangers of playing on a PvP server.</p>
