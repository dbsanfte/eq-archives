        Hey Art, <br> <br>The Far Seekers sound like a great bunch of people. &nbsp;Perhaps we should all throw a get drunk and kill everyone bash at the Arena for fun. &nbsp;Or just the "get drunk" part....give people from both guilds the chance to get to know one another. =) <br> <br>What does everyone else think? <br> <br>

        Good to know! <br> <br>I know that I, for one, will make every effort to find some Far Seekers to group with in the near future. &nbsp;It might make a more formal introduction come about more naturally if we've had some exposure to the individuals in their guild and they've had their chance to wonder what they've gotten themselves into *evil laughter*
