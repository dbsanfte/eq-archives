        As many may or may not know, I have a friend named Tukim. &nbsp;He is pretty fat and has an issue with his digestive system. <br>Well, he is in Silent Blade of Norrath. &nbsp;He knows of a little girl that wants to meet more of you. &nbsp;Her name is Samaria and she is looking to get together in East Commons this Sunday at 7pm EST. &nbsp;I am available for ports that day for anyone interested in coming. &nbsp;I may also supply some Fresh Berries and Heady Kiola for naked table dances...*peers over at Lilla* <br>There is also a place for you all to post on SBoN website. &nbsp;Please speak with Lilla, Serenya or myself for the password. <br> <br>Take care my little puppies and see you all around. <br> <br>Sandy

        wha??? I dance naked a few times and I'm labeled??? &nbsp;Besides, if you'd paid close enough attention, you'd notice I wasn't completely naked. &nbsp;I had my hair tied back with a CLOTH bow :)
