<br<p><b><h4><p align=center>Guild Loot Policy</p></b></h4><br>
<p align=left><b>First Cut Lotto</b></p>
<p>1.1  Items found during a raid will first be lotto'd to the members of the raid party that can (and want) to use the item.  For example, if the item can only be used by monks, then all monks in the raid party with an interest in the item will lotto the item among themselves.  This also means that if there is only one monk in the group he/she/it wins the item by default (unless the monk does not want the item).<br><br>
1.2  Once a member wins an item and the item is found again, then the person is out of the lotto for that item until all other members either win the item or do not desire the item.<br><br>
1.3  Members of the raid party are able to loot items for their alts if and only if they specify this at the beginning of the raid.  If the member does this, though, they will <b>not</b> be allowed in the First Cut Lotto for the character that is currently in the raid.<br><br>
2.1  Items that make it past the First Cut Lotto will then be placed in a general lotto with all the members on the raid pary able to lotto for the item.  In this phase, any member that desires the item can lotto for it, unless they have already won the same item in a previous lotto.<br><br>
3.1  Any items unclaimed after the First Cut and General Lotto will go to the guildleader to be auctioned off, and proceeds will go to a guild fund set up to promote member tradeskills and/or purchase gems for future guild raids.</p><br>
<p>4.1  Master Looters will be designated at the beginning of the raid (one Master Looter per group), and all items/cash will be split and Lotto'ed <b>at the <em>end</em> of the raid</b>.  In order to be permitted in a lotto, you must have participated through the duration of the raid, and be present when the items are lotto'd.  Exceptions to this rule may apply at the soul discretion of the Guild Leader or whenever an item is NO DROP, in which case the item will be lotto'd immediately.</p><br><br><br>
