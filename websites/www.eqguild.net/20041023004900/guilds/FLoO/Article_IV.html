<b>Article IV. ~ Promotion from Conscript to Centurion</b>
<p>
<p>
<b>Sec a) </b> you must attempt to participate in guild events whenever possible.
<p>
<b>Sec b) </b> Recruitment of potential new Legionnaires: <p>

1. While at the level of Conscript you can invite people you group with, meet, or otherwise know into our guild. <p>

<b>Sec c) </b> Promotion of the Foreign Legion of Odus: <p>

1. Whenever the opportunity presents itself, spread the word of the Legion.
Always conduct yourself in a manner that is befitting of our guild. <p>

<b>Sec d) </b>Lead by example: <p>

1. In terms of being willing to assist others within the guild when possible, and helping to guide and inform new members in terms of training and learning about our guild. <p>

<b>Sec e) </b> by following the chain of command, in turn, once you are promoted, the respect you gave to your superiors will then be revisited upon you by your insubordinates. <p>

<b>Sec f) </b> for your character that is a Conscript to become a centurion, you must be registered at <A HREF=http://www.guildmagic.com>guildmagic.com</A> <p>

<b>Sec g)</b> in game please do not use /anon but rather /roleplay. <p>

(Both conceal your identity, but /anon makes your guild tag disappear, and keeps other guild members from knowing that you are online. You may also elect to use neither and just remain known to all.) <p><p>
