Black Thorns is an all dark race guild (consisting of Dark Elves, Iksars, Ogres, and Trolls), dedicated to the promotion of all true dark races (not including cross-teamers) and the advancement of all members through guild grouping for experience, guild raids for equipment, and any other devices that can be used to increase enjoyment while playing.</font></center></text><br><br>



<center>Goals of the Black Thorns</center><br>
<ul><li>Bring ruin and destruction to the light dwellers!</li><br>
The time has come for Norrath to feel the embrace of darkness. The unholy alliance of the three dark gods shall send fear and trembling into the hearts of all. (The Black Thorns shall not falter to destroy the other teams).<br>
<li>Make a defense for the darkness!</li><br>
The light dwellers are aware that the day of their defeat is coming and they will try and stop the darkness knowing full well that they stand in the path of the inevitable. (The Black Thorns shall stand ready to defend their dark brethren and their lands).<br>
<li>Spread the words of darkness and anguish to all!</li><br>
Those that remain unaffiliated cannot become martyrs. Those that remain in ignorance cannot know why their lives were forfeit. All must know of the coming day, all must be prepared for its arrival; all must know they face the dark alliance of Innoruuk, Rallos Zek, and Cazic Thule. (The Black Thorns shall promote Role-Playing).<br>
<li>Destroy those that are traitors to the darkness!</li><br>
Ogres, Trolls, Iksars and Dark elves must stand together to prepare the path. Those that make alliances outside of the darkness must be destroyed so that a pure people can stand ready when the war comes. (The Black Thorns will not tolerate cross teaming).<br>
<li>Make ready for the coming dark war!</li><br>
Only those that are strong shall survive the Great War. The dark races must train themselves in combat. When the great day arrives they must make their stand firm on the side of darkness for the war shall be among gods, but settled by mortals. (The Black Thorns shall have fun being evil).</ul><text><br><br><br><br><br>
