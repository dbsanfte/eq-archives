        As I sit here at wave 40 with a score of 1577719, I'm glad I have something to do. I'm practicing skills and it's dreadfully dull. Not that Gems isn't dreadfully dull in its own right, but it's more exciting than foraging.  <br> <br>I hear a lot of people criticizing Gems... saying it should be removed, saying people are getting killed because they aren't paying attention... I dunno. I think idiots will always find something bright and shiny to stare at be it a game of Gems or a sparkly bit of foil on the carpet.

        ROFLMAO!! <br> <br>I don't particularly care for the game, myself. &nbsp;It's a bit dull for my taste....but I like having the option not to play it. &nbsp;LOL &nbsp;If they took it away, I'd complain because there is that rare occassion when I will start up a game of gems to pass the time. &nbsp;Options are good. &nbsp;And the option not to play is as valid as the option to play. &nbsp;I don't want to give up my option to criticize an added feature if I don't have to. hehe

        I finally had to force the game to end.... at wave 76 I still only had 2-3 rows at the bottom ... I finally made them stack to the top so I could sign off.... final score was 2,315,786
