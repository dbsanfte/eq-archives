Nice job in Kael tonight guys, excellent execution and quick recoveries after the couple unfortunate deaths that we had. Unfortunately no luck with the drops, but still a good time. Thank you for all who attended and Dashadowmaan for the great job leading the raid. Definately need to do more of these to get us suited up in some Velious armor.

I hope you had been working on your Santa Claus Faction this year.

I would also like to issue a warning : despite the fact he obviously carries a lot of loot he is also a serious undercon. After all what other npc do you know that can control 7 pets at the same time ?

Well, here is hoping that your encounter with Santa Claus goes well. If attempting to pull him solo, away from those pesky little helpers, then it is rumoured that some mince pies and sherry can be used to reduce his aggro radius..

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you all!<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

Wishing Saldir and you other strange types who celebrate Christmas a day early a very Merry Christmas! Hope you all have very happy holidays!!!!!!!<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

After a couple of really nasty camps, Skarrad finally completed her Robe of the Lost Circle quest.

Impromptu Hate Raid. A good time was had by all, got a couple of rather nice drops. Our thanks to Aamilee who was a star leading us through the hate Plane.

Well, the server crash put pay to the planned Kael raid, so we headed there later on and a good time was had by all, with no wipeouts and some loot dropping for once.

Headed quickly to Trakanons Teeth to make sure everybody had their Sebilis keys. Was very quick and even got some for a couple of guests who tagged along. Unfortunately servers crashed just at the end and at least one person lost their medallion as a result.

Small single group attack on Chardok. Headed down to the overseer room and pull to there. Again good team work and crowd control meant things ran like a dream. Drops were fairly good, congratulations to Skarrad on a Stave of Shielding, Augusta on the level 54 spell - Reckoning and Tignous on his new Argents Defender.

Raids recommence. Went to Sol B in a search for GEBs. We were lucky in that the Efreeti showed up 2 out of 2 to start with - congratulations to Saldir and Augusta and the new bootees - Then the Efreeti took fright and did not reappear for the remainder of the raid. Some very good teamwork.

A number of important members of the guild have decided to leave EQ for pastures new, owing to real life issues. Our thanks goes out to Araxas and Tabula for their contribution to the guild and we wish them both well. Also our thanks to Jaimus who has also moved on to other challenges beyond the game.
<BR>
After a turbulent couple of weeks it is time to ring the changes. Expect to see a new look website, new image, new officers elected to replace those who have moved on, and watch us step up a gear in terms of raiding activities.
