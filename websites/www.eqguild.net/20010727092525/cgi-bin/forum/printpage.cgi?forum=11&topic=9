        For some reason I haven't been able to get this working on our own site, but I do have it running on another of my sites, and so here it is, so we can chat for now (today is a patch day) <br> <br><a href="http://fff.fathom.org/ubb/wolfdenchat.html" target="_blank">Wolf Den Chat</a>

        I restarted it. *sigh* I hate having to use our home computer for this.... hopefully I'll soon be able to get it working with public irc servers.
