<p align="center">This is more a warning than a tip... BE CAREFUL
who you trust. I have heard many stories of people that let
someone "hold" something for them while they switched
characters only to find that their "friend" ran off
with their weapon, or people (myself included) who bought some
wonderful item for a ridiculous amount of money only to find out
it was NOT what promised, or that they could not equip it! ALWAYS
ask someone you know to hold items, or ask a guild member. IF a
guild member ever pulls a stunt like that they won't be a member
long! When buying always left click on the item before paying and
makes sure it's what you were promised and that you can equip it,
remember to check both class AND race!</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><u>Some helpful
commands</u></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#400080" size="3">/corpse - </font><font
color="#000000" size="3">will "summon" your corpse if
within 50 feet of you. This is helpful when you need to loot your
corpse somewhere safer or you are stuck in a strange place!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#400080" size="3">/consent <player>
- </font><font color="#000000" size="3">If you are unable to get
to your corpse or get close enough to drag it, ask someone you
TRUST (see tips/warning above) to drag it to a safer spot for you.
Type in /consent tweehugger and tweehugger can drag it to the
designated spot (in the same zone). The person given consent can
then use the /corpse command (above) to drag it.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#400080" size="3">/yell or /y</font><font
color="#000000" size="3"> - yells for help, tells any in the area
where you are in relation to them, EX. Tweehuger yells for help
from off to the left of you. Use this, and NOT shout when you
need help. Shout will do no good, noone will know where to go to
help you.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#400080" size="3">/gems</font><font
color="#000000" size="3"> - if you are real bored, use this
command to play a little tetris-type game!</font></p>
