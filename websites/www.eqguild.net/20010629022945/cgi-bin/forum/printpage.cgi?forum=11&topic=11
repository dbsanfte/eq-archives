        *ding* &nbsp;8 and 9, in one night... <br> <br>Thanks to Manglore, who spent about two hours carting me around and buffing me while I fought things that would have otherwise ripped me into little elfin nuggets. <br> <br>Now I have my spells, and I'm running around buffing naked newbies...I love it!
