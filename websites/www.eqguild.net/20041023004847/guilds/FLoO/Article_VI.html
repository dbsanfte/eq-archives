<b>Article VI. ~ Recruitment</b>
<p><p>
<b>Sec a) </b> guild recruitment is vital to our growth and future potential. Centurions, Militant Council, and the Imperator General all have the ability to invite people into our guild. <p>

<b>Sec b) </b> it is the responsibility of every member to scout potential members and to report if they think someone is fit for service. The scout is considered the recruiter, even though they may not be able to actually bring someone into our fold.
<p>
<b>Sec c) </b> to qualify for guild entry, you must have reached your tenth season. (Level 10)
<p>
<b>Sec d) </b> our guild does not discriminate against any of the races upon Norrath or Luclin. This makes it possible for us to maximize our potential by employing various styles and classes.
<p>
<b>Sec e) </b> as a recruiter, it is on you to keep track of those you invite, and make sure they understand that they become part of what we have as an equal.
<p>
<b>Sec f) </b> it is the responsibility of the Inviter to brief said invitee on the ways of the guild, conduct, and our structure. If you are not sure about some details, do not hesitate to ask a superior.
<p>
<b>Sec g) </b> I ask that all new recruits be brought up to speed on any upcoming raids, events, where to find our web page, and about guild magic.
