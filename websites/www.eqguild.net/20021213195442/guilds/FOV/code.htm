        <P align=left>&nbsp;</P>
        <H4 align="left">Above all - HAVE FUN! The ultimate purpose of the Fellowship 
          is to enhance the enjoyment of EverQuest for those of us who play it...whether 
          this be by helping someone out with a heal or a buff, to achieve an 
          item they have been questing for or simply to be there to talk to. We 
          are a Fellowship and we help each other out whenever/however we are 
          able. We group with our guildmates whenever possible and thru this we 
          grow to trust each thru the daily commitment we show. The following 
          outlines the basic principles we follow to be part of this Fellowship. 
        </H4>
        <H4 align="left">All members will need to read and understand the Fellowship's 
          Charter and agree to our Code of Conduct. We will only give consideration 
          of membership to characters that have achieved the minimum level of 
          20. We feel it is necessary for a player to become familiar with the 
          basic mechanics of the game and their chosen class before attempting 
          to join into our guild.</H4>
        <H4 align="left"> Each prospective member will be informally interviewed 
          by an officer with that officer becoming their sponsor thru their initial 
          phase in the Fellowship. For the first month of their enrollment they 
          will then be considered an "initiate". During this time the guild can 
          get to know them and visa versa. After 4 weeks a vote will be taken 
          among the officers to pass the initiate into full membership. At least 
          5 officers must vote to pass or deny, if less than 5 show they know 
          this person well enough to vote then the initiate phase will be extended 
          another 2 weeks where another vote shall be taken. </H4>
        <H4 align="left">It is required of members to sign up on our message board 
          at eqguild.net. It is very important to us that our members be willing 
          to take a few minutes at least twice a week to check the board regarding 
          current guild events. This is a very integral part of our guild. We 
          use our forums to announce all our events allowing players enough time 
          to prepare and participate to the best of their abilities.</H4>
        <H4 align="left"> All members are also required to register their characters 
          and alts at guildmagic.com so they may be listed on our roster. (Both 
          of these registrations are free and painless.) Alts are offered membership 
          only after the member has reached level 30 and has finished their initiate 
          phase. </H4>
        <H4 align="left">The following is common courtesy that we would hope from 
          all players but most importantly, upheld without question by our members.</H4>
        <H4 align="left"> Members shall conduct themselves in a mature manner, 
          rude and antisocial behavior does not befit being in The Fellowship. 
          Playing an evil character does not give you the right to be mean and 
          abusive. Spamming in any form and the use of vulgar or foul language 
          in open text (ie: /OOC, /SHOUT, /AUCTION, or regular /SAY's where a 
          third party/parties could hear it) will not be tolerated, and repeated 
          offences could be grounds for dismissal from the guild. </H4>
        <H4 align="left">Harassment of another player is unacceptable. If a dispute 
          arises between a guild member and another character, for whatever reason, 
          and it can not be resolved by either party, then the guild member should 
          then /Ignore the offending character and, if necessary, report the reason 
          for the dispute to a GM. Under no circumstances should the arguement 
          be taken to /OOC or /SHOUT channels. </H4>
        <H4 align="left">Begging from others, whether in guild or not will NOT 
          be tolerated. If you need something do your part to earn it-do the research 
          and know your facts. Posting on the forum all pertinent info needed 
          to help you attain your goals will help us to assist you better. Although 
          guild members can and often do help others with quests, obtaining needed 
          items and power leveling, it should be understood that the key word 
          here is HELP not do it all for you. </H4>
        <H4 align="left">Be considerate of others' abilities. Do not abuse another's 
          skills in any way. (Teleports, Resurrections, trade skills, etc.) If 
          you are in need of anyone's services, feel free to ask in guildchat 
          ... If you get no response after a couple of inquiries, then that means 
          they are unavailable to assist you. It is recommended that all guild 
          members assist each other but not at the expense of one's happiness 
          in the game. It is strongly suggested that all guild members assist 
          in the event of an emergency (evacuation, difficult corpse retrieval, 
          rescue of any type, etc.) within reason. Inconvenience or a long run 
          does not constitute an emergency. </H4>
        <H4 align="left">The practice known as "kill stealing" will also not be 
          tolerated. That is to say, the intentional taking of a kill from someone 
          else who was fighting it first. This is an ambiguous area, and common 
          sense and respect for others in a group situation must be used. When 
          you arrive in a new zone you wish to camp in, ask for a camp check. 
          Then if upon reaching the camp that you presume empty only to find a 
          camp, respect the person's right to camp there as they simply may have 
          missed the afore mentioned camp check request. If you are the victim 
          of kill stealing, do not use /OOC or /SHOUT to deal with the problem, 
          send a tell to the person and let them know you are camping that area. 
          If they continue to Ksteal, petition a GM. Please remember that wandering 
          creatures are uncampable and you are only entitled to it if it aggros 
          you first or you lay the first blow. </H4>
        <H4 align="left">There is never a good reason to participate in an intentional 
          training. If you are found to be invovled in such, you will be reprimanded 
          and possibly removed from the guild. We do understand that unintentional 
          trains do happen. If you are caught in a situation where you are going 
          to train to zone, please try to announce...Train to zone. </H4>
        <H4 align="left">Under no conditions is it acceptable to play using tactics 
          that are considered "dirty" or "unfair". This includes such practises 
          as 'ninja looting', buying low/selling high or 'profiteering', and/or 
          'loot hogging'. This is not helping anyone but that person, not to mention 
          it takes advantage of other players. As should go without saying, your 
          actions reflect on the guild as a whole, and therefore, you should act 
          in a manner that won't adversely affect our image. </H4>
        <H4 align="left">Given that this a Role Playing Game, having the roleplaying 
          tag on is warmly accepted, but under NO circumstances should the /Anonymous 
          tag be used as this takes your guild tag off. If you are not proud of 
          the guild you belong in then you shouldn't have the tag at all and simply 
          type /guildremove while having yourself targeted. </H4>
