<h2>Branded Guild Charter</h2>
<P>
<h3>General:</h3>
<P>
Branded is an adventuring guild based on the Torvonnilous server. Our members are fun and vibrant players that group together while exploring Norrath. We encourage grouping together frequently and actively helping each other. Branded is about belonging to a mature and strong community. We value loyalty over leveling. Above all else, however, our main objective is to have FUN while playing EverQuest.
<P>
<h3>Leadership:</h3>
<P>
Branded is governed by the Guild Leader and Guild Officers. All members are expected to respect and abide by the discretion and decisions of the Guild Leader and any of his Officers.
<P>
The Guild Leader, with the assistance of the Guild Officers, is responsible for overseeing the general direction and administration of the Guild. Most matters shall be determined by consensus through a vote of the Guild Officers, but the Guild Leader reserves the right to make the final decision on all matters concerning the Guild.
<P>
The Guild Officers are members that have demonstrated a high level of commitment and dedication to Branded. The responsibilities of Guild Officers Include inviting new members, providing help to existing members, resolving player disputes, and assisting the Guild Leader with the administration of the Guild. Membership requires a substantial time commitment and should not be taken lightly. Individuals that are interested in becoming a Guild Officer should indicate their interest to a current Guild Officer for consideration.
<P> 
<h3>Conduct:</h3>
<P>
All members are expected to conduct themselves in a mature and honorable fashion at all times. Remember that your actions represent your guild.
<P> 
We encourage you to be relaxed and at ease within your Guild and to simply use discretion and good taste when dealing with more sensitive Guild members.
<P>
<h3>Chat:</h3>
<P>
Guidelines for using Guildchat are as Follows:
<P>
1.  Do not use Guildchat to attack or humiliate other Guildmembers, use private chat to settle any personal disputes.<BR>
2.  Try to remember that we encourage new players to join and therefore the Guild is often the only source of companionship for some members, Keep Guild chat fun and pleasant.<BR>
3.  Trading amongst ourselves is wholey embraced and encouraged, if you can afford to donate items to other members, great, if not please be reasonable.
<P>
<h3>Alternates:</h3>
<P>
Members of Branded are "encouraged to avoid" (ultimately what you do is up to you) having alternate characters in other guilds. Branded is about being an active participant in our guild family.  We would prefer that our members not suffer from divided loyalties.
<P>
<h3>Removal:</h3>
<P>
Guild removal shall be a measure of last resort. All reasonable efforts shall be made to achieve resolution of an issue before resorting to removal of any member. In the event that removal is found to be the sole remaining option, a majority vote of the Guild Officers shall result in that member being removed. In an emergency situation where a Guild Officer feels that failure to act immediately will result in irreparable harm to the Guild, they shall have the discretion to immediately remove a member from the Guild, However this is not encouraged. If a member is removed in this manner, they shall have the right to immediately appeal their removal and submit to a majority vote of the Guild Officers as soon as possible. In any event, all members shall have an opportunity to explain themselves and present mitigating evidence to defend themselves.
