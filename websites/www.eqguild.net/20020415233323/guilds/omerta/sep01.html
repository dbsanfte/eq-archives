Omerta made its first attempt at the Kael Arena today. We made it up there with little problems, and set up at left ramp. Had a good run at the mobs outside the Arena, with I think a lvl 57+ Veteran being the highest mob we were able to take down today. We were lacking a FD puller over level 50, so was mostly just tank mezzing and charming our way out of trouble. Did manage one reasonably spectacular wipeout hehe, but recovered quickly. Thanks to Yaell/Ayami from OC and Caellon/Murielheart from LotH for joining us today. Not much on the loot side, diamond for the guild resist fund and some <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/ceruleanvambraces.html" target="_blank">Cerulean Vambraces</a> for Ramrod. Excellent first run, think with a few more levels under our belt we can really start tackling the tougher mobs en-masse.

Once again we had bad luck getting the key mob for our second group to spawn in ToFS, and wound up having to call it short of our goal of clearing the tower. Besides the 2nd key mob not spawning for us, we have a smooth run from floors one to six. Picked up a few pieces of loot today too; grats Mahd on a <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/sparklingsoulnecklace.html" target="_BLANK">resist necklace</a>, Jenson on a <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/embalmerskinningknife.html" target="_BLANK">bandage knife</a>, and Tabula on an <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/vhalaseraskullearring.html" target="_BLANK">earring</a>.

I created our Raids/Events calendar today which can be found <a href="http://www.localendar.com/public/omertaxev" target="_blank">here</a>. There is no reservation system on Xev and I like it that way, however if you're a non member reading this and see something that would conflict with your schedule, feel free to send me a tell in game and maybe we can work something out. This is mostly here so its easy to get to for our members, the majority of these raids are not open to the public. If you have any questions or suggestions for the Calendar itself, Ariasong is going to be the main person working on it.

Big thanks to everyone who came out to help with Renux for the rogue epic today. Was a really long fight since we didn't have a tank high enough level to fight her straight up and wound up having to agro kite her. Three casualties on our side, countless nukes, DoT's, and snares later we wound up with a <a href="renux1.jpg" target="_blank">dead Renux</a>. Grats Araxas on the epic pieces, Ariasong on a <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/ravenscalecloak.html" target="_Blank">Ravenscale Cloak</a>, Breiz on <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/trochilcsskean.html" target="_blank">Trochilic's Skaen</a>, and the guild bank on a <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/ravenscalebelt.html" target="_Blank">Ravenscale Belt</a>. After that it was off to East Karana for a quick kill of the Dark Elf Corrupter. Grats Dextal on his piece for the druid epic.

Finished our first run on The Hole today. Things generally went really well, though we did get wiped out twice hehe. If nothing else we learned a lot about this zone today, and how to deal with one long, continous fight with no end in sight to all the adds erm.. adding in. Definitely a place Omerta will be returning to soon both as a raid and I'm sure some xp groups. Picked up some loot for our INT casters today as well. Grats Jaal on a <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/loamencrustedchoker.html" target="_Blank">Loam Choker</a>, Rikera and Jaal on some <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/loamencrustedveil.html" target="_blank">Loam Veils</a>, and Saldir on a <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/loamencrustedcap.html" target="_blank">Loam Cap</a> we got from Rocksoul.

I added a printable list of <a href="gems.html" target="_blank">Velious quest gems</a> to the site today. This should help pick out the good ones from your horde after a night's hunting in Velk's, Cobalt Scar or wherever. Omerta added a few new members to its ranks tonight, the first time we've done so in a while. Congrats to those who joined us tonight.

No go on the Ice Giants inside Perma today unfortunately, as there was yet another (5th in as many days I believe) attempt on Vox in the works while we were all porting up there. Instead, we headed over through Kael to get everyone their Wakening Land portal teeth, and spent the afternoon hunting flying monkey things. Not much in terms of loot, but grats to Korudan on his marginally useful <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/glovesofkromzekmight.html" target="_Blank">Kromzek Might gloves</a>, Tignous and Tabula on quest pieces for Ice Forged Shackles, and the bank on some spells we actually needed. Also had a pair of <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/holgresh_spirit_beads.jpg" target="_blank">Holgresh Beads</a> drop for Challangarr and Mahd. These had me excited for a bit thinking that's two less people we need to equip with insta-cast junk buff items, but it turns out they're a permanent effect unlike the goblin earring, grats to a misc. newbie or vendor on those.

We had a good run on Chardok today, even though we were a bit short on manpower in the healing department. Minimal deaths and solid teamwork. Nothing nice in the loot department today though. I've added a database of Omerta's spell bank today which can be found <a href="spells.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Usually the guild bank is a private matter, but I've marked several spells for sale to anyone who needs them outside the guild. To request a spell (assuming we have a copy for sale) please leave a post on the public forum including your offer in pp. Doing IG's inside Permafrost tomorrow, details on raid forum.

The past few days have been distressing and difficult for everyone in light of recent events. On behalf of the Everquest guild Omerta, I offer our sympathies, hopes, and prayers to all the victims and their families. Let us hope something like this will never happen again.<BR><BR>
I have spent a great deal of time thinking about the events of the past few days, and am a bit saddened by some people's reaction. I have written this <a href="terror.html" target="_Blank">article</a> with my personal views on this matter. Please note that this is solely my (Araxas) personal opinion and in absolutely no way represents the views of my guildmates in Omerta. In fact, there have been quite a few disagreements in our discussions over the issue.

Heh, got off to a subpar start in ToFS today and wound up making a few mistakes which cost us some time. Eventually we got things rolling, and cleared the 5th floor multiple times only to have our second key mob not show up until it was late in the afternoon and time to start devoting our attention to beer, food, sleep and other things not EQ. Managed a pair of 6th floor keys  though, so we should be finishing up ToFS fairly soon. Despite the slow start, we did wind up with a bit of loot today. Grats Korudan on a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/embalmers_skinning_knife.jpg" target="_blank">bandage knife</a>, Tignous and Ariasong on some <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/velium_spiked_Skull_helm.JPG" target="_blank">Velium Skull Helms</a>, and Ariasong on a pair of new weapons, <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/Fang_Garou.jpg" target="_blank">Fang of the Garou</a> and <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/magneticdirkofdistraction.html" target="_blank">Dirk of Distraction</a>.<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

Excellent raid on Chardok today. Our teamwork is really becoming solid; seems like all the raiding we've done on easier zones has paid off for us now that we're raising the stakes. Even our one wipeout was well handled, thanks to AV for helping us clear some of the roamers so we could rez up. Grats to Jaimus on a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics11/silver_swiftblade.jpg" target="_blank">Silver Swiftblade</a>. Also picked up a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/runic_carver.jpg" target="_blank">spare 2-hander</a> for Korudan and a nice <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics11/IvoryImbuedCollar.jpg" target="_blank">shammy amulet</a> for the bank. Going to try to pick up tomorrow where we left off the other week and finish off the rest of ToFS including the boss mob on the top floor.<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

Been a quiet week so far as we've geared down and started levelling up to shoot for some tougher raids in the coming weeks. Grats though to <a href="ice.gif" target="_blank">Tabula</a> for finishing his <A href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/nostrolotambourine.html" target="_blank">Nostrolo Tambourine quest</a>. Tabula's been happily singing, dancing, and prancing around with his new Selo's speed, which should stave off any labor strike threats and keep our casters happily fed with mana song for a while longer.<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

Had a weekend of preparation raids heh. Saturday found us in Great Divide where we spent way too many hours mowing down everything two pullers could find that gave +Coldain. Most of the guild now has the faction needed to get us started on our Thurgadin armor quests. We did the wurms for a bit, but not much luck on getting useful spells. Today we were back in Trakanon's Teeth where we finished pretty much everyone's Sebilis key quest. The August news has been archived in the Old News section.
