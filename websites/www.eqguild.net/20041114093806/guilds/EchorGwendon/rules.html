  <p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span> A guild is defined as (1) in medieval times, a union of men in the same craft or trade to uphold standards and protect members; (2) any association for mutual aid and the promotion of common interest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Echor Gwendon is a guild of friendship and companionship.  We uphold the values of trust, honor, integrity, respect, and teamwork.  These values are maintained through a strong friendship that we seek in Echor Gwendon.  Uberness, levels, greed or self-petty interests do not drive the members of Echor Gwendon.  The treasure we seek is the priceless friendship that we seek to forge within Echor Gwendon and the quests or accomplishments that we seek to achieve as a Guild within Everquest.</p><BR>

<BR><font size="6"><b>B</b></font><font size="5"><b>asic Guild Rules</b></font>
<BR><P><p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'></span>Echor Gwendon is guided by simple rules.  Those rules can be summoned up in two words:  Be Nice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>  We strive to assist all guild members (and even non-guild members).  We never demand help.  We ask, we assist, we share – no conditions.  
<BR>Greed can destroy any guild.  We are not requiring members to share all their wealth, but we do expect contributions from all members.  Greed alienates members and this undermines the value of trust and companionship that we strive for.

<blockquote><BR><BR><li><b>No Kill Steal (KS)</b></li>
<BR>We do not KS under any circumstances.  KSing is a good way to earn a bad reputation for yourself and for your guild.  Memories can be quite long in EQ.
You should create an “assist” hotkey to target any mob.  This will tell you if that mob is engaged in combat or not.  If you do KS by accident, apologize immediately.  Anyone caught KSing can be removed from the guild immediately (including all characters of that individual).</blockquote>

<blockquote><BR><BR><li><b>No Ninja Looting</b></li>
<BR> This means that we share loot. We do not loot during a battle while guildmates or group members are still fighting.  We assist or fight until all mobs are killed.  The loot isn’t going anywhere; it will be there at the end of the fight.
Loot will be done on an alpha list, meaning we take turns looting alphabetically.  If you loot something that another guildmember needs or asks for and you have no need for it, it is encourage that you give the item to that member.  You never know when someone may loot something you may need.</blockquote>

<blockquote><BR><BR><li><b>No Abusive Language</b></li>
<BR>Teasing and goofiness is one thing; insulting or swearing at someone because you don’t agree with them, or because they can’t port/rez/PL you or give you items and/or platinum is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.  We strive for harmony in our guild and this kind of behavior is counterproductive of the spirit of Echor Gwendon.</blockquote>

<blockquote><BR><li><b>Problems With Guildmates</b></li>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>If you have a problem with another Guildmate, DO NOT take this problem out in Guildchat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p> Try to resolve the problem between you and the other individual in Tell.  If you feel as if the problem is not being solved, the problem is worsening or cannot be solved without mediation, bring the problem immediately to an officer.  Explain the problem to the officer and let the officer handle the situation and/or problem.  It is the duty of the officers to resolve any guild problems and to ensure that fair play, cooperation and harmony is achieved in the guild.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><BR><li><b>Problems With Other Players</b></li>
<BR>If you are having problems with other players, DO NOT take it out in a Shout or Out Of Character match.  It is suggestion that you attempt to remedy the problem through the use of tells to that individual and ask them to decease and quit that behavior.  If the individual refuses to do so or to acknowledge you, submit that individuals name to an officer.  This insures that this individual will never receive a guild invite into this guild.  </blockquote>

<blockquote><BR><li><b>Problems With Other Guilds</b></li>
<BR>If you are encountering problems with members of another guild, make a note of the time, the zone, the place in the zone, and any other witnesses to the situation. DO NOT engage in a shouting match with the individual.  Shout or Out Of Character speech can earn you, the other person and the guilds involved animosity among the other people in the zone.  Give all pertinent information to an officer immediately and then allow the officer to handle the situation.</blockquote>

<blockquote><BR><li><b>No Begging or Whining</b></li>
<BR>We are here to assist each other.  We are not nursemaids, loan officers, or personal porters/healers/bodyguards to any specific individual.  The druids in this guild are not your personal taxi drivers, the clerics are not your personal healers and the chanters are not your personal crack dealers.  If you need help or assistance, ask.  If you do not get a reply in a reasonable time, assume that your question(s) cannot be answered or that everyone is tied up and cannot assist you at that time.  Sending out requests every five minutes for help, ports, PLing, etc., is a good way to lose respect with your fellow Guildmates.  Each person is responsible for them self and should not expect others to do their work for them.  It is strongly encourage that Guildmates help one and another, but do not take advantage of the kindness of your Guildmates.  This can encourage those individual to reduce their assistance in helping the guild and may alienate them from the guild and to leave our family.</blockquote>

<blockquote><BR><li><b>New Members</b></li>
<BR>The minimal level any new member must have is 11th level.  Any officer may provide an exception to this rule, but the officer must have a good reason for this.  An officer may have to explain this exception to fellow officers in a guild meeting.  Alternate characters are excluded from the minimal level rule.</blockquote>

<blockquote><BR><li><b>Guild Recruitment</b></li>
<BR>Any one in the guild can recruit new members into Echor Gwendon.  If any Guildmate finds an individual that you believe would a great asset to the guild, please contact an officer(s) and submit that name to them.  Officers will then make an effort to meet with the individual and ask them if they would like to join the guild and give the guild invite.  You may give the officers’ name to this individual to ask for an invite, but please notified the officer ahead of time to tell them about this.</blockquote>

<blockquote><BR><li><b>Number of Characters</b></li>
<BR>The number of characters per person is limited to 4.  Characters will be designated as main, primary alternate (PAlt), secondary alternate (SAlt) and tertiary alternate (TAlt).  An individual is allowed to have a PAlt once their main character has reached at least 25th level.  An individual is allowed a SAlt once their main character has reached at least 35th level and PAlt is at least 20th level.  A TAlt is allowed once the main character has reached at least 45th level, PAlt has reached at least 30th level and the SAlt has reached at least 20th level, or that the main character is at least 51st level.  
Characters can be changed from their level of importance (generation).  This means if someone decides that they want their primary alternate to become their main and their main to become their primary alternate, they must submit a request to the Guild Leader.  Only the Guild Leader is allowed to change the designated importance of characters in the guild.</blockquote>
<BR><font size="6"><b>G</b></font><font size="5"><b>uild Raids</b></font>
<BR><P>Guild raids can be lead by any guild member.  Raids can be a Pick-up Raid (raids created on the spur of the moment) or a Structured Raid (raids that are planned and coordinated for a specific purpose at a specific time).  For all intent purpose, only structured raids will be discussed in this section.
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Raid Posting</b></li>
<BR>Officers will post all Structured Raids in the Guild Calendar and in the Guildmotd.  Not all raids will be posted in the Guildmotd, so each individual will need to check the Guild Calendar every other day.  Officers are not required to memorize all raids for guildmembers.  Raid postings will have the start and end time, place, level requirements, purpose, the leader and/or co-leader of the raid.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Raid Objectives</b></li>
<BR>Raid objectives can be one or more of the following:  loot, experience, faction, specific item or mob, quest completion or something entertaining.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Raid Designee</b></li>
<BR>Anyone can request to lead a raid.  It is the duty of any officer to ensure that the guild member requesting the raid has done the research for the zone to include levels needed, number of people, knowledge of the mobs, appropriate meeting location, classes required, time and date of the raid, co-leader of the raid, and the plans to achieve the objectives.  Depending on the raid, not all of these items need to be addressed.  
If the officer approves of the raid, the raid will be posted in the Guildmotd and/or on the Guild Calendar.  Space and importance of the raid will determine whether the raid is posted on the Guildmotd.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Raid Management</b></li>
<BR>If you are planning to attend a raid, contact the Raid Leader (RL) or the Raid Co-Leader (RC).  This allows the RL and RC to begin to make group assignments based on the strengths and weakness of each character and class.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Raid Time</b></li>
<BR>All raid personnel are expected to meet at the designated spot 15 minutes prior to the start of the raid.  Ensure that you have transport there or camp at the location the night before or earlier in the day.  Also ensure that you have all the items you will need to conduct the raid (food, spell components, etc).</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Hot Keys</b></li>
<BR>Upon the arrival of all raiders, the RL or RC will give out assignments; such as who is designator as the Puller, Evacer, Primary Healer, Secondary Healer, Caller, Main Assistor, etc.  Once you are given your assignment, make the necessary Hot Keys based on your assignment given to you by the RL/RC.
<BR>The Caller is a very important position and should be a person who may not have an assignment or not given a heavy assignment.  The primary purpose of the Caller is to make the decision of retreat.  When the Caller calls for a ‘Run,’ all other members must repeat the command and then pull out of the fight by any means necessary.  Do not pull out if someone has not repeated the command.  That individual may not have heard the call for the retreat.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Raid Loot</b></li>
<BR>All items acquired will be divided at the end of the raid on a need basis for those that had participated in the raid.  Any items not taken will either be sold and money divided or will be placed in the Guild Bank.  If two or more individuals request the same item, then a NEED will be established of who will get the item by an Officer.  The only exception to this rule is items acquired for Epic Quests (which will go to the individual the raid is for or by level if there are multiple members on the raid for that item).  Another exception are No Drop items which will be established by NEED and then by /RAN 1000.  If no one requests the No Drop item, use /shout to announce the item and its location.
<BR>Items acquired but not going to the Guild Bank nor to any individual will be sold by the individual with the highest charisma.  All coins will be collected by one or two individuals.  Autoloot will be turned off.  
<BR>At the end of the raid all coins collected or gained through the sell of items will be given to the RL and the coins will be evenly divided among all members in attendance.</blockquote>

They are designed for a general purpose, but not structured.  It is a grouping that is ‘come and go’ at will.  List times for these groupings are tentative and not set in stone.  Anyone can lead these events and last as long as guildmembers want it to last.
	Looting is generally done on an alpha format.  If an item is looted by one member and another member needs that item and the looter does not, it is encourage that the item is given to that individual out of respect.<BR><BR>

<BR><font size="6"><b>G</b></font><font size="5"><b>uild Bank</b></font>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Guild Treasury</b></li>
<BR>The Guild Treasurer will manage the Guild Bank, though guildmules of other officers may hold on some of the money for EG.  Anyone can donate funds for the Guild Bank.  Some raids may be designated to raise funds for the Guild Bank.  
Funds in the Guild Bank will be used solely to assist in sanctioned Guild Raids (specifically Epic Quests Raids or specific mob raids).  Those funds will be used to purchase KEIs, gems, rezzes, food or other items needed for that raid.  Funds can be used to assist a guild member to become a Grand Master in a specific tradeskill.  The Guild Leader and two Guild Officers must make approval of this.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Guild Items</b></li>
<BR>Items given to the guild by its members or through raids will be maintained by any officer of the guild.  Officers will be designated to maintain a Guild Mule for the guild and to hold on to items that are acquired and to distribute those items. 
Items acquired by the guild through guild raids or by donations by guild members will be distributed on a need basis.  The officer will make the determination based on the need of the guild, generation of the character, service given to the guild by the individual and length of membership of the member.<font size="3"><b>  NEED BEFORE GREED; GUILD BEFORE INDIVIDUAL.</b></font>
<BR>Any item obtain by the Guild does not give the individual the right to sell, trade or barter the item away.  These are Guild items that are used to help the Guild and Guildmates to benefit the Guild as a whole.  If you outgrow an item you acquired from the Guild, contact an officer to return the item.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Guild Items Sold</b></li>
<BR>Guild Items can be sold upon the approval of the Guild Leader and the Guild Officer maintaining the Guildmule.  The minimal qualification is that that specific Guildmule must have held the item for more than two months.  The item may be sold either in the bazaar or to a NPC merchant.  Funds obtain from the selling of items will be place immediately into the Guild Bank.</blockquote>
<BR><font size="6"><b>G</b></font><font size="5"><b>uild Officers</b></font>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Number of Officers</b></li>
<BR>The minimal number of officers for Echor Gwendon will be three (2 officers and the guild leader).  The officers in a majority vote will determine any future officer positions.  That determination and vote will be based on guild size, the need of the guild and any outside (RL) circumstances.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Officer Nomination</b></li>
<BR>One week before a regularly scheduled guild meeting, the Guild Leader and Guild Officers will discuss nominations for an officer position.  Candidates will be selected based on their loyalty, commitment, knowledge of the game, respect from fellow Guildmates, service rendered to the guild, and their ability to lead by example.  Those individuals that get a nomination will be notified prior to the guild meeting to either accept the nomination or to decline the nomination.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Officer Selection</b></li>
<BR>At the guild meeting the Guild Leader or appointed Guild Officer will read out a list of nominees for the new officer position.  All guild members are then required to vote for each individual as they are named.  Three types of votes will be registered by each individual in a Tell to the Guild Leader or appointed Guild Officer who will be compiling the votes.  The only person that does not vote initially will be the Guild Leader or appointed Guild Officer.  The votes that are to be cast are CO (confidence in the individual), NC (no confidence in the individual), or NV (no vote).  Votes will be tallied as +3 points per CO vote, -2 for each NC vote, and -1 for each NV vote.  The nominee with the highest amount of points will become a new officer of the guild.  In case of any tie, the Guild Leader or appointed Guild Officer will cast a separate vote to break the tie.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Officer Duties</b></li>
<BR>All officers have the duty to follow and obey the rules of the guild and to enforce those rules.  Officers must be aware of the rules and changes to the rules and be able to clarify the rules to other members or to answer questions that Guildmates may have.  Officers will handle disputes immediately and fairly without any personal bias.  If the dispute is beyond the capability of the officer, he/she must enlist help from another officer and/or schedule an officer meeting to discuss the problem.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR>All officers will be required to screen and post raids on the Guild Calendar.  Officers are not required to run a raid, but a strongly encourage to create raids or events for the Guild.  An officer may be required to maintain a Guildmule.  In addition, officers may be given additional duties as determined by the Guild Leader.</blockquote>
<blockquote><BR>Officers must remember that they are representatives of the guild.  They must remember that they have been honored by their fellow Guildmates and have been given that honor when they assume the position of a Guild Officer.  Officers have already acquired the respect from their Guildmates, but must never forgot to lose it.  It is an honor to serve the Echor Gwendon as an officer and it is a duty that should not be taken lightly; it is not a privilege.</blockquote>
<BR><font size="6"><b>G</b></font><font size="5"><b>uild Titles</b></font>
<P>The use of Guild Titles is a system to provide a ranking structure in the guild.  This ranking structure is a way to award those individuals who have made a strong effort in helping the guild and its members but also to serve as a rank structure for rare loot order.  The Guild Title allows individuals to be recognized by their Guildmates for their loyalty and service to the Guild and their comrades in the guild.  
<BR>Nomination for promotion to a Guild Title is done via e-mail to the Guild Leader.  During the officers meeting, the Guild Leader will provide a list of nominees for promotion.  The Guild Leader reserves the right to reduce that list down when presenting it during the officers meeting.  The Guild Leader will consider the reasoning and number of nominations received by other individuals.  The Guild Officers will then select the number of Guild Titles that will be awarded during the Guild Meeting.  This decision will be made based on the number of members, characters, growth, and current number of titles already presented in guild.  If the number of titles equals or exceeds the number of nominees, all individuals will be given a new Guild Title.  If the number of titles is less than the number of nominees, then there will be an election of Guild Titles in the Guild Meeting.  An officer that is not on the nominee list will serve as the ballot taker.  Individuals in the guild meeting will be allowed to vote a specific number of people for a Guild Title.  
<BR><BR>The following is the list of Guild Titles from lowest rank to highest rank.  The Guild Titles are in Sindarin Elvish

The officer will present the information to the council and then the council will discuss the matter and how to the handle the situation.  If a Guildmate is being accused, that Guildmate will be given the opportunity to present their side of the story in an honest and accurate report.

 <BR>Any individual can be removed for any violation of guild rules or repeated offenses of guild rules or guidelines outlined in the guild charter. 
 <BR>Any behavior in the guild that is disruptive should be addressed immediately.  If the behavior is severe, a Guild Hearing should be called.  If the behavior is so EXTREME that the name and/or image of Echor Gwendon will be severely damage by this behavior, the officer must make a judgment at that time and whether to remove the individual or not from the guild.  If the individual is removed, the officer must make note of the time and conditions that warranted such removal and be prepared to explain their behavior in an officer meeting.  This meeting serves a few purposes:
<BR><P>1 - Ensure that officers are not abusing their power.
<BR>2 - To provide critical feedback on what to do to avoid similar problems in the future.
<BR>3 - To provide a system of support for the officer that engaged in the removal.
	
<blockquote><BR><li><b>Guild Leader/Officer</b></li>
<BR>Given that EG is a democratic guild, a guild leader and or officer can be removed by the request of any individual.  Upon that request, all officers will convene a meeting (with the exception of the individual being request to be removed) to discuss the complaint and then investigate.  If the investigation reveals that the complaint is legitimate, then a Vote of Confidence must be taken.  This can be done during the regular scheduled guild meeting, during a special emergency guild meeting or be done with all individual currently on line (though how long the balloting will be is up to those officers).  Individuals will vote in one of three ways in a tell to the committee chairperson:  Confidence, No Confidence, No Vote.  Points are awarded as followed:  Confidence +2, No Confidence -2, No Vote -1.  If the total points are in the positive, there will be no removal from position.  If the total is negative, the individual will step down from their position.  If the Guild Leader is voted out, an officer will assume the role as Acting Guild Leader until such a time can be established to elect a new Guild Leader.</blockquote>
