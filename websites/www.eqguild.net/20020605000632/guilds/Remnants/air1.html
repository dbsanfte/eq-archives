Ok first a brief overview of PoS - think of it as a mix between Temple of Solusek Ro and Hate or Fear. It can be raided, and there are drops, but there are also bunches of quest items that you can hand in on the quest island to get cool rewards. Which brings up an interesting point - Plane of Sky is divided into a series of 10 different islands floating in the air. You start out on the lowest island and progress from island to island until you eventually reach the top. The general pattern for each island is this: kill normal mundane mobs, collecting quest items until you spawn the island's Boss mob. Kill the boss mob to spawn a halfling named Sirran the Lunatic. Sirran will ask for a different item on each island (from that island) and in return will give you a key to proceed to the next island. Basically, if there is an item that every mob killed drops like 3 of, it's a key item, otherwise it is probably a class quest item. Most of the class quest items are no drop and should therefore be looted by the appropriate class, although some are not.<br><br>
Entry and exit - Entry to the plane occurs in 1 of 2 ways. Either you port up with a wizard using the Alter Plane: Sky spell, or you died and are rezzed. Alter Plane: Sky requires some sort of reagent that can only be purchased in Erudin Library and costs about 250pp each. It's not cheap, and if the raid group isnt on the first or second island it isn't really possible to pick people up midway through a raid, so a raider pretty much has to commit to coming for the entire time. Gate spells don't work is PoS so there is only one way out - down. Jumping off of any edge (provided that you dont hit another island and die) will cause you to fall out of the zone, whereupon you will find yourself swimming in the Freeport Harbor just in sight of the docks. Note that exiting the zone in any way - linkdeath, jumping, camping, whatever will cause you to lose all of your keys (though you can't go back to an island you have already passed anyway)<br><br>
Level - Like any Plane, PoS can only be entered by players who are above level 46. However, unlike PoF and PoH where most things are levels 48-51 with bosses being 53 or 55, PoS has mobs that are levels 50-57 or so, with bosses ranging all the way up to 63. Deaths will occur, and probably quite frequently. Due to the relative difficulty, it would be my reccomendation that only people 50+ attend raids here, with possibly an exception for clerics, since extra CH's never hurt anyone. Necromancers would probably be fine also, since fights will last a very long time and clerics and enchanters may be short on mana. For other classes though, the simple fact is that below 50 you will be doing very little damage, and due to the amount of lag caused by lots of people, raids will probably be limited to 30-36, none of whom can therefore be bumps on a log so to speak. To put it in perspective, island 1 contains faeries who are all level 50 with their princess being 53. Island 3 is Azaracks, all 53 including the boss. Island 4 has various mobs that are 53-56, with the boss being 61-62. Most things hit for low-mid 300's. Oh yeah and all bosses but the first 3 Deathtouch.<br><br>
The rest of this guide will detail each individual island in order, as they are numbered on the map provided with this guide. Note that all islands except #0 and #2 are in ascening order, both of linear progression and elevation. (in elevation, #2 and #0 are just barely above #4)
Island 0 - Island 0 contains nothing. It cannot be reached via a teleporter from any other island, nor is there anything on it. It is simply the island which the point 0,0,0 resides upon, and is only used by Verant CS Representatives when they port into the zone (much like the "cat rooms" of many dungeons)<br><br>
Island 1 - This island is where you show up when you port into PoS. Note: DO NOT USE AE SPELLS OF ANY TYPE ON THIS ISLAND!! Doing so will hit the quest givers in the bottom section, and that is a very bad thing. Mezzes should be single target only, and charm works well too. This island contains a number of Thunder Spirits [faeries] that are not aggressive, though they will all help if you attack any of them. This island also contains the Keymaster, an NPC that sells this island's keys (as an alternatve to killing the Thunder Spirits for them) as well as Coffins for Summon Corpse. Eventually, after some killing the boss of this island will spawn, a princess. Killing the princess will spawn Sirran who you can then hand in key quest items to. (DO NOT SAY ANYTHING TO SIRRAN OTHER THAN HAILING! Sirran has been reported as hitting for up to 2050) After handing in key items (there are 2 keys for this island) you will end up with 2 keys that work in the 3 various teleporters on this island. One telepoter will bring you to a cave in the bottom of this island, which is where the npcs that give the class quests reside. Another teleporter goes to island 2, with the final teleporter going to island 3. Key quest items: Miniature Sword (or something like that) and Rabbit's Feet<br><br>
Island 2 - This is a rather small island containing a single windmill-like structure. If he is up, Noble Dojorn will be on this island, along with 2 guardian Blade Spirits. None are agro. Killing Noble Dojorn (no small task!) will spawn the Overseer of Air on island 5. The only way off of this island is by using the key from island 1 that you used to get here. Key quest item: None<br><br>
Island 3 - This island is inhabited by 9 Azaracks [imps] which ARE aggro. Mezz does not work very well here, though it is still possible to use it. The boss of this island is the Protector of Sky. Killing him will spawn Sirran, allowing you to hand in the key quest items from this island and proceed to island 4. Key quest item: Broken Mirror<br><br>
Island 4 - This island is inhabited by a slew of different stuff, most notably the gorgalasks [gorgons]. A large temple dominates the greater part of the island. There are also Gusts of Wind and Crystalline Clouds which are air elementals that will invis themselves. Nothing here is aggro, but everything will assist each other except shimmering meteors [red wisps]. This island's boss is Gorgalosk, who will spawn Sirran and allow you to turn in the items for the isle 5 keys. There are also 2 sub-bosses, a Heart Harpie and an Avenging Gazer. To avoid fighting all three at once, all 3 should be pulled out of the temple and run off far from the actual point of engagement. The puller then feigns or dies or whatever. Another person will hail Gorgalosk in place (she responds to hails and will stop moving) at which point the other two can be split and pulled. One last notable feature of this island (and the ones above) is that a haste belt for every melee/hybrid drops here. All have ac/stats, warrior, rogue, and monk belts are level 21 haste (same as FBSS), bard, paladin, shadowknight, and ranger belts are level 16 haste (1 less than Hangman's Noose, same as Swirlspine Belt). Key quest item: Animal Figurine<br><br>
Island 5 - This island contains another small windmill and is inhabited by 3 Pegasii (yes that is the plural of Pegasus, because I said so) and 3 Griffons. Whenever a Pegasus or Griffon is killed, it will split into 2 more, and when each of these splits is killed it will respawn once more. So for each 1 mob you see, there are really 5 (1/2/2). The boss of this island is the Collector of Souls, a named Pegasus who will spawn Sirran when killed. Also, if Noble Dojorn was killed, the Overseer of Air will be up on this island, near the windmill. If the Overseer is killed (good luck!) the Hand of Veeshan will spawn on island 9. Pegasii and Griffons are not aggro, however the Collector of Souls, Overseer of Air, and all splits ARE aggro. Note that it is also possible to pull things from this island down to island 4 by either: having a monk with good safe fall hop the gap between 4 and 5, or by having a person aggro a single spawn and then reviving their corpse back on 4. Handing items to Sirran here gains you keys to island 6. Key quest item: Bird Whistle<br><br>
Island 6 - This island is inhabited by spirocs, all of which are aggro but have low aggro radii. There are 10 total, 1 Lord, 1 Guardian, 3 Vanquishers, 6 various flavored. Each of the 3 roosts (noted on the map) is guarded by a single spiroc vanquisher, with 2 various-flavored guards. The vanquisher MUST be killed before his guards because if a guard dies and the vanquisher is still alive, the guard will respawn at its spawn point (not its death point though). After all 3 vanquishers and 6 guards are killed, the spiroc Guardian may be killed. Note that killing the Guardian before all of the vanquishers is dead will cause it to respawn, which can in some cases be an effective way to farm quest items. After the Guardian has been killed, the Spiroc Lord may be killed. Killing the Lord will spawn Sirran and allow you to turn in key items to get to island 7. Key quest item: Noisemaker<br><br>
Island 7 - Before porting up to this island, invis. After you get up here, immediately move behind the large rusted gear. On this island there are 3 Bzzazzts [wasps]. They are aggro, have a large aggro range, but do not see invis. The left Bzzazzt will need to be taken out first, so when it is pulled the other 2 will need to be mezzed. The Left Bzzazzt splits 1/2/2 like the Pegasii/Griffons on 5. Bzzazzts hit very hard, the best way to fight them being to have an enchanter cast Dictate (level 60 charm) on the second one, as it will make short work of its comrade. After the Left Bzzazzts are dead, the next target will be Right Bzzazzt. This one splits 1/3 and will be a very tough fight indeed. After finishing off Left and Right Bzzazzts, the center Bzzazzt will be fought. The center Bzzazzt spawns another Bzzazzt, which spawns a bixie, which finally spawns the boss of the island, a named bixie. Killing the named bixie spawns Sirran. Hand in the quest crap and get your keys. However, before moving on to island 8, someone should tell Sirran "Am I the wall" or "I am the wall" (can't determine which from people's enigmatic posts) but it needs to be spelled backwards. This will cause the Sister of the Spire to spawn on island 8. Key quest item: Dull Dragon Scale<br><br>
Island 8 - This island consists of a bunch of sphinxes and drakes, nothing is aggro on this island except the Sister of the Spire. There is a large temple on this island; the Sister spawns inside. Killing the Sister will either spawn the final Sirran who will provide you with keys for island 9, or you have to pull the Hand/Eye off of 9 from 8. Key quest item: Dunno, possibly none<br><br>
Island 9 - This island is another small one containing a single windmill. The Eye of Veeshan spawns here, as well as the Hand of Veeshan if the Overseer of Air was killed. This is the final island.<br><br>
