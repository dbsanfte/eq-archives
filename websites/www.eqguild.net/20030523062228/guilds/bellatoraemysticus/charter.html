     </font><font face="Arial">Bellatorae Mysticus stands by the principles of honor and
     courage. Bellatorae will aid those in need without reward and will give freely of their
     resources to help valiant causes. They stand by each other in battle and insure all
     members are taken care of. Bellatorae live and die together, no one is left behind. Among
     other citizens of Norrath, Bellatorae are known for their friendly demeanor while
     grouping, their ungreedy concern for loot and valor in combat. </font><font

     <p><font face="FestivalFlourish"><big><font color="#9B2325"><b>Membership Requirements</b></font></big><br>
     <br>
     </font><font face="Arial">To become a member of Bellatorae Mysticus, a candidate must
     first be sponsored by a member of the guild. Once sponsored, the candidate must group with
     two officers in the guild and be recommended for membership by both officers. Knowing
     someone in the guild in RL constitutes automatic membership in the guild at the request of
     the guild member who knows the applicant in RL. Guild membership may not exceed 25
     accounts without a guild vote. </font></p>

     <br>
     </font><font face="Arial">- Bellatorae greet one another with a salute (/salute).<br>
     - Bellatorae "Hail" (/guild Hail) their fellow warriors when logging in.<br>
     - Bellatorae die honorably and never blame others for their death. <br>
     - Bellatorae sacrifice for others even if it means death or loss of substantial resources.
     <br>
     - Bellatorae settle disputes generously and are first to admit fault.<br>
     - Bellatorae strengthen one another, not criticize.<br>
     - Bellatorae seek adventure, not power or leveling<br>
     - Bellatorae find solutions, not problems</font><font face="FestivalFlourish"><br>

     <p><font face="FestivalFlourish"><big><font color="#9B2325"><b>Guild Raids</b></font></big><br>
     <br>
     </font><font face="Arial">Raids are periodically scheduled by the Guild Leader, however,
     they may be scheduled by any member of the guild who wishes to sponsor one. Although not
     mandatory, all guild members are highly encouraged to attend raids for the building up of
     the guild camaraderie and improve guild grouping skills. </font></p>
     <p><font face="Arial">Loot for raids is divided evenly among all members participating in
     the raid, however, preference goes to those who are capable of using the acquired items
     for the character who is at the raid (not secondary characters*). All loot acquired that
     cannot be used by or that is rejected by present guild members because they already are
     using something more powerful will be rolled for (/rand 100). Rolling only occurs once.
     Highest roller chooses from the remaining loot first followed by the second highest and so
     on but skipping any member who received preferential choosing prior to the rolling. Once
     everyone has recieved one item and items still remain, the LOWEST roller then may choose a
     second item and followed by the second lowest roller and proceeding back up the list. Thus
     the highest roller has the advantage of choosing first from all the items but must wait
     for all member to choose twice before getting to choose again. This is the official
     procedure for dividing loot, however, guild members are encouraged to be generous with
     each other meaning some members may come away with nothing while other get several items.
     The underlying philosophy is to do what is best for the guild not what is best for the
     individual. </font></p>
     <p><font face="Arial">* (A guild member may request to acquire an item for a secondary
     character but use a different character to help acquire the item. However, they must
     inform the other members of the raid that this is their intent at the beginning of the
     raid, not when the item is acquired.) </font></p>
