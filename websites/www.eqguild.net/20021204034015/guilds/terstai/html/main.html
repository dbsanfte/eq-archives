Since the release of EQIM a few weeks ago we have received a lot of very positive feedback about this new EverQuest feature. The most common comment was "this is great, it should be free." At its launch we had planned on EQIM fees to offset its development cost.<P>
Happily, your very positive response to the release of Planes of Power and the continued growth of new players has put us in the wonderful position where that cost is no longer an issue.<P>
A big thanks to the EQ community old and new for their support of the world of Norrath. Please enjoy your free EQIM.<P>

<B><U>By Winged Messenger</U></B><P>
A lone messenger streaks across the rocky roads of the mighty Wakening Lands, an urgent message kept safely within his talons. Dire news he brings to his master, the Lord Yelinak; there is much turmoil in wake of the prismatic's release, and he must inform the ancient dragon of the weary times to come. As he rushes past the lumbering trees on all sides of him, he harks back to a more peaceful time. Certainly the brow of his mighty Lord showed less strain, less agitation, though not much. He had always thought that the prismatic's release would surely be more problematic than anything else he could imagine. He now knew that there was much more at stake than ever before, and that the Shrine would need to be on its guard.
<P>
As he came to the entrance of the Shrine, he tensed for a moment, hoping that this dire news wouldn't end the life that he and his kin had known for so long. Yet he feared that nothing could stop that change, for the might of the Kin would be tested in the coming times, and there would surely be dangers he had yet to see. He made his way through the corridors up to his master's chambers. As he came closer, he noticed new members of the Kin he had never before seen. As large as his Lord, they spoke quietly amongst themselves and with Yelinak himself. He was unnerved by this startling addition to the Shrine, but felt that it was likely necessary. Perhaps his Lord had already heard the news and had already begun making plans. Either way, it was his duty to inform Yelinak of the recent events; the Giants would know no struggle like that which the Shrine would give them.
<P>
He walked towards Lord Yelinak, majestic in his appearance yet with a certain calming aura about him. He cleared his throat and began, "M'lord Yelinak, I bring news from the East..."

<B><U>Music Player tips</U></B><BR>
We came up with a few tips and comments about using the Music Player. Here are some hints that may help: 
<UL type="disc">
<LI>You can use wildcards when specifying files to load. For example, if you click "Add", browse down to C:\MyMusic, then type "*.mp3" in the edit window portion of the File Selection Window, then click "Ok", the Music Player Window will attempt to add all files in the C:\MyMusic directory that end in mp3. 
<LI>When saving playlists, be sure to put the .M3U extension on the filename or you won't be able to load it again. When loading files, the Music Player looks at the extension to determine what kind of file it is, and won't load files of types it doesn't recognize. 
<LI>When first opening the File Selection Window, you may notice a delay while the code determines which drives on your system are valid. 
<LI>While songs continue to play during zoning, no song can begin during zoning. The Music Player will continue with the next song when you zone in. 
<LI>When the Random button is depressed, the playlist is scrambled. Un-pressing the Random button will revert the list back to its original order for ease in finding certain listings. Pressing Random again will re-scramble the list in a new "random" order.

As of 2 am cst this morning, Guild Magic was still down, so this isn't to let you know it's back up yet. But for those that use IE 6, I looked in their Forums and found this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Many of the problems that people experience with GuildMagic come down to their cookies settings. If you are having problems with the system taking you back to the main login screen, the chances are there is a problem with your cookies settings.
<P>
Please check that your system is configured to accept cookies - GuildMagic uses a cookie stored on your computer to remember who you are.
<P>
If you use Internet Explorer version 6, you may need to explicitly tell your browser to accept the GuildMagic cookie. This is done as follows:
<P>
Click the little eyeball with Red "No" icon down there in the lower right corner of the browser...
<P>
Click Settings Button...<BR>
Click Edit Button...<BR>
Type guildmagic.com<BR>
Click Allow Button...
<P>
This should eliminate most of the problems with the site.

If that doesn't get you fixed (when the site is up and working again), I'll check my settings in IE 5 on my other puter and post those as well. I haven't ever had trubs with getting in there, so we'll get everyone fixed up in time.

<P>
Soon you will be able to play your favorite MP3s from inside EverQuest. An in-game MP3 player is now undergoing testing on the Test Server. Once this added feature goes live, a simple in-game command will open the MP3 player window and allow you to listen to your favorite selections of EQ music or selections from your very own MP3 music library.
<P>
If you log on to the Test Server for a preview, use Alt-K to launch the player and configure the player window via the Options screen. The music even keeps playing while you zone!
<P>
Keep checking <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/" Target="_blank">EverQuestLive.com</A> for future announcements about the in-game MP3 music player and when it will be available on the live servers.

Another tidbit announced by Alan on the Developers Corner.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><U>NPC Slow Mitigation</U></B>
<P>
Generally speaking we don't announce new NPC functionality, tricks, spell effects or other things that we think are part of the discovery of a new expansion or zone. However, this functionality isn't working properly right now and in doing so it is causing a bit of confusion. 
<P>
With Planes of Power we gave NPCs the ability to mitigate the effect of slow-type spells. This means that some NPCs have the ability to cause slows to be less than 100% effective. This is not a "slow cap", when it is working properly. The best slow will have the best effect. 
<P>
This allows our designers much more freedom to balance encounters when considering the use of slow spells. For Planes of Power they did not have to decide solely between the two extremes of slow taking full effect or just turning it off. The relative power of each slow spell is unchanged, and making NPCs immune to slow spells is not the only option when tuning an encounter. There are some encounters where we would like to see slowing considered a good thing for a group to have, but not to the point where the NPC becomes a wimp after he's slowed. 
<P>
In theory this is a great thing. 
<P>
However, some time between beta and the release of Planes of Power this new feature stopped working properly. Thanks to everyone that sent in emails and /bug reports for helping us narrow down the problem. 
<P>
We are aware of the problem and we're working on getting it fixed.

If you are seeing odd looking wolves it could be related to your texture cache. If you are seeing the odd wolves and have texture cache turned on, then you should delete all of the *.txc files in your EverQuest directory. This should return your wolves to normal.
