        Just for fun, we're also starting out some new characters on the PVP race war (teams) server Vallon Zek. Characters should be High Elf or Wood Elf, which start in Greater Feydark. Opalecia has a lvl 8 high elf paladin (Ouella) on that server already who can assist in levelling to some extent.  <br> <br>Questions should be posted here.  <br>Once you've made your character, post here as well.

        I know we haven't really discussed this much since the original idea formed but I'm still looking forward to it. &nbsp;I'll create my pvp character within a couple of days. &nbsp;Perhaps after we see how everyone likes it, we can set aside a day of the week or month in which we all go pvp for awhile. &nbsp;  <br> <br>Of course this is all voluntary and there may be some that pvp doesn't appeal to even on a short-term basis, but I think the more of us that create characters, the more fun we will have as a whole. &nbsp;I'm really looking forward to it!
