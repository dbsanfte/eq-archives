Ok.. these are just going to be in random order for the time being.. 
<br>
<br>
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">NO begging for items OR money.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">NO asking to be power leveled.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">NO asking to be twinked.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">NO putting down other guildies, we are a family, not a school playground.  
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">IF you ask for help on a quest item (on the MB only) you will recieve help getting the item(s) not have someone get the item for you.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">IT is YOUR responsibility to check the site and messageboard for updated information on raids and events that are going to be happening.  I do NOT want to hear people saying that they weren't informed, that's not our job.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">NO profanity in guild chat, at all.  This includes any and all vulgar or "bad" words you could think of.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">NO talk about sex in any way, shape or form in guild chat.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">IF you need an item or money and need assistance getting it, post a message on the board and wait for a response.  
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">IF you have an item that you wish to sell, please dont use guild chat like an auction unless you are giving the item away to a guildie for free.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10"> ANY Items given to you by another member stay in the guild, handed down from one member to another, they are NOT to be sold.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">IF you leave the guild you will not be let back in, except for in certain circumstances which will be decided upon by the High Council and Council.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">IF you are close in level to another member or two, try grouping with them, get to know them, make a friend.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">NO Kill Stealing AT ALL.  You will be removed immediately if we find out about it.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">IF you plan to leave the guild, inform one of the High Council or an officer, tell us why, that way we can try to improve on problems.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">EVERYONE in this guild is a representative of this guild. Actions that make you look bad make us look bad and will not be tolerated. When in disputes, members will behave in a polite and courteous manner.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">DISPUTES within the guild must be handled in tells, not in guild chat or shouts. If no resolution can be found, it will be brought up before one of the officers. 
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">DISPUTES outside the guild will be handled in a similar way. If no answer can be found that way, go to one of their officers. If that doesn't help, come to one of the officers and we will do what we
can to resolve it.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">NO scamming or stealing of any kind.  You will be removed immediately if we learn of anything like that occuring.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">NO pick pocketing.  We understand this is a skill, but it could cause alot of unneeded problems.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">IF you must run on /anon, try using /roleplay instead as it displays your guild tag.  When i see guild members on /anon it makes me and others as well feel that you are ashamed of our guild, if that's the case use /guildremove as well.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">FROM now on we will be voting on membership via polls on the Messageboard.  They will be totally anonymous but will give soe of the members a chance to say no if they have a problem with any person wanting in.  The polls will remain active for 24 hours and then shut down, so please check the boards once a day.  Also, if someone wants in, tell one of the High Council so they can add a poll for that person.
<br><img src="dot.jpg" width="18" height="10">AND last but not least, we will be enforcing these rules constantly and will not tolerate them being broken, so beware if you break them.
<br><br><center><i>The above rules can and will change at ANY TIME.  Check them often.  Thank you.</i>
