Just finished an excellent mini-raid on ToFS. Our plans to make it to floor seven didn't quite go through, as we were consistently one floor below another guild, and had to wait on them to complete their keys a few times. On the fourth floor the key mob spawned once for us then wouldn't show herself again, and we wound up calling it a night there.

Mellow day of quests today. Started by rounding up some forces <a href="decorr.jpg" target="_blank">to kill</a> the Dark Elf Corrupter for Reakwon's epic. Grats on the Fleshbound Tome thing. Tarbul Earthstrider was standing in an unfortunate spot next to us and we killed him by accident too :(. Lastly, it was off to FoB where a couple of us helped Skeeth finish his <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics14/scaled_mystic_helm.JPG" target="_blank">Scaled Mystic helm</a> quest. ToFS raid tomorrow night. <BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

Grats Manthas <a href="manthas.jpg" target="_blank">on finishing</a> the Soulfire portion of his epic today. Nice work everyone on finishing off Sir Lucan and all the guard adds with only 11 of us in our 30's and 40's level wise heh. Guild teamwork is getting a lot better. Various raids posted on raid forum including ToFS and Chardok. <BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

Good time in City of Mist today, cleared pretty much everything short of the locked door. Once again no luck with rare drops, our standard dead druid, but a great afternoon anyways. Grats Ashteroth of PL on his epic, and thanks for letting us join in the fun. Members please try to make it to tomorrow's raid, going to do a fight for Manthas' epic, followed by one for Reakwon's in EK.

Nice <A HREF="pvp5.jpg" target="_blank">turnout</a> today for our PvP & alcohol tolerance night, heh. After some good <A HREF="pvp4.jpg" target="_blank">duels</a> and team PvP free-for-alls (no screenshots of this sorry, was too busy hunting down druids :P), we decided to hunt the Cargo Clockwork in Steamfont for his loot. Unforuntately luck was on the <a href="pvp2.jpg" target="_blank">Clockwork's side</a> today, so we regrouped our <a href="pvp1.jpg" target="_blank">fallen army</a> and decided to drink our misery away. Some of our quieter members found new courage in their drunken stupors and <a href="pvp7.jpg" target="_blank">began boasting</a> of their running speed. Only seemed fair to put them to the test and a <a href="pvp3.jpg" target="_blank">drunken roadrace</a> of naked gnomes across the Steamfont Mountains ensued. Grats Manthasx for putting the question about the fastest gnome to rest. Challangarrx, to the best of our knowledge, is still running around steamfont as of this writing somewhere yelling about the LFay zone line being a myth.</font></td>

Had a good time in Trakanon's Teeth today, even though we didn't have much luck finding any named mobs. Picked up both halves of the Sebilis key quest for five people, and the forager one for everyone else. Had our obligatory druid deaths, and some mage spell to bank =/. Welcome to those who joined our ranks today. Kedge Keep xp group tomorrow, details on raid forum.<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

Hmm, I guess this page was down earlier, I didn't notice, but sorry for that I guess :P. Congrats to the new members who have joined us in the past week or so. We're still selectively recruiting, especially warriors and clerics, so if joining our little <strike>cult</strike> guild interests you, check the joining section to find out how. Quite a few upcoming raids posted, members please check raid forum.<BR><BR>
As a little sidenote, I was running to the Sarnak Fort in LOIO to drag some newb's corpse out from inside, when I came across <a href="troll.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. Can you figure out which of the two pictures is the real statue?<br><hr noshade color="#000000">

Thanks all who showed up for tonight's Splitpaw group. Was fun, even though Ishva'Mal never showed up to give us his robe and spell :(. Only semi-interesting drop was a 4wis 2str ring, I had always thought these were player made items only. More fodder for guild bank heh.<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

I added a printable location list for Kunark and Velious outdoor zones <a href="loclist.html" target="_blank">here</a>. It's missing a few zones and locations, but hopefully will be helpful. Also, congrats to Reakwon on becoming our third officer.

Manthas and myself finished our <A HREF="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics15/ice_forged_shackles.gif" target="_blank">Ice Forged Shackle</A> quests yesterday, big thanks to Reakwon for the help. After a bit of a late start, a group of us spent the afternoon in Great Divide working on Thurg faction and hunting wurms. Picked up a number of dropped spells for various people and the guild bank. Thanks all who came, was a good time.

	  A group of us went down to Solusek's Eye and fooled around for a few hours. Was lots of fun, thanks to those who were able to make it. Grats Jaal on his <A HREF="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics2/TurquoiseEyepatch.jpg" target="_blank">Turqoise Eyepatch</A> and the guild bank on a Charred Guardian BP. Faction raid coming up on Saturday, all levels welcome, details on Raid Forum.

	  Quiet Sunday heh. Please check my post on the members page of the forum, we're using a new system where the member list on website links to online profiles. Doing an guild faction raid on GD to boost our dwarf faction some this saturday, also taking a group to Sol A on wednesday, details of raid forum. 	  <BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

	  We did a small 2 group raid on Mistmoore followed by one group to Kedge Keep today. Unfortunately a lot of other guilds had the same plans as us, and it got a bit overcrowded. After getting
	  trained a few times and rezzing back up we finally made a pretty good run at the castle. Kedge was much of the same with some guild in there with 30 people trying for Phinny (no comment). It was a fun afternoon though, and was good to see 
	  everyone there. Thanks to Skarrad for working with me on the pull team and Augusta for rezzing us up even though both were playing on a lousy connection and Ayami of OC for her kind help. Not much loot with all the trains, but I think we got a Crafted BP for guild bank.
