<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><u>Guild
Etiquette</u></font></p>

<p align="center">A guild is ALWAYS a team, and the officers are
there to serve you, however sometimes distance is a factor. Keep
in mind that when requesting an officer to recruit someone you
found for the guild, it may take some time for them to reach you.
An officer in the area should make every effort to get there, but
do not expect an officer 10 zones away to come running! The same
rule stands when requesting help finding a corpse, a guide to a
new zone, etc.</p>

<p align="center">Another issue is mana and time. Our guild
casters are happy to heal, sow, cure, buff, breeze, teleport, etc.
etc. for guild members, HOWEVER it is unfair to ask a healer to
heal you so you don't have to waste time sitting, and THEY end up
having to med twenty minutes while you run off to get hurt again!
Also keep in mind that the casters are not strictly there cast
spells on everyone that asks, they would like to be off fighting,
leveling and etc. as well!</p>

<p align="center">If you DO need to ask for a heal, SIT DOWN in
the meantime! Sitting greatly increases your heal time, thus
hopefully saving the caster a little mana!</p>

<p align="center">Also be aware that sometimes casters are busy!
The wizard you just begged to nuke the croc you can't quite kill
may be trying to get a Drybones off his own butt! Or the
enchanter you are begging for a breeze from may have 14 tells
requesting the same thing!</p>

<p align="center">To those of you that ARE casters, you should
make yourselves as available as you can to heal, sow, cure, buff,
breeze, teleport, etc. etc. to fellow guild members, as long as
it is reasonable and not an interference with your own game
enjoyment! Don't be afraid to tell a persistant member (or non-member
for that matter) that you aren't there to be their personal mana
slave!</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><u>Group
Commands</u></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#400080" size="3">/gsay or /groupsay
</font><font color="#000000" size="3">- Use this to speak to only
your group members. Can also access this by right clicking
anywhere on the text screen.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#400080" size="3">/assist <target>
- </font><font color="#000000" size="3">this command will
automatically make your character attack whatever your target is
attacking. Ex: You are in a group and an Orc Priest jumps your
healer, Tweehugger. Target treehugger and type /assist to rush to
her aid! This is a good command to have on a hotbutton if you
group frequently. To quickly target the right player, simply
click on their name in the box on your upper right.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#400080" size="3">/autosplit - </font><font
color="#000000" size="3">can also be accessed in your socials
bank, this command automatically splits any money a group member
gains while looting equally among all group members.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><u>Group
Etiquette</u></font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">There are a few
topics here to cover for a good and organized grouping experience.
Like the guild etiquette section, much of this pertains to our
wonderful casters, however all group players have their
considerations. I'll try to cover it all, so bear with me. If I
leave you out my apologies!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">First let's talk
about grouping in general. The best thing to do when looking,
whether you just want a partner, or a full group, is to /shout.
Include your level, class, and what sort of hunting you would
like to do, if you have something specific in mind. Use "LFG"
(looking for group)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">ex: Tweehugger
shouts, lvl 20 druid looking for croc partner</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">Tweehugger
shouts, lvl 14 ranger LFG to hunt gnolls</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">or just</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">Tweehugger
shouts, lvl 56 pally LFG</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">Ask in /guildsay
as well, there are over 30 members, chances are you can find
someone around your level and close enough to group with!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">Some suggestions
when grouping would be to seek others close in level (I usually
only group with those within two levels, higher or lower than me).
This is important so that experience is distributed fairly
equally. Also look for players of "like mind", whether
you are the fun loving sort, serious minded or whatever. Also
before joining an already established group, or when starting a
new one, take the time to discuss what you wish to do and how you
wish to do it, addressing what you would like to hunt, how you
are splitting loot/money, and who is doing what (who heals, who
nukes, who tanks/pulls, etc.) Look for a grouping that has at
least one healer, one nuke and one tank/puller. An enchanter is
good to have, and it never hurts to have a second healer for back-up.
An idea for what to look for in a group would be a healer (Druid,
Shaman), a second healer for backup and buffing that can nuke and
fight when not healing, a nuke (Wiz), an enchanter, one tank (Warrior,
Paladin, Monk) to pull, and a second tank for backup. A tank with
taunt is great to have, keeping the casters from getting attacked
is priority! Of course there are many variations on this, and
take into consideration WHAT you are fighting. You may want two
nukes instead of two tanks. There's no rule either saying you
have to have 6. However, keep in mind the quickest death is the
best death!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">Second let's
tackle looting. Looting in "free-for-all" style is
never fair and just bad manners. The casters of the group usually
stand back some from the fighting. So in a "free-for-all"
group they keep the others alive and do the nuking but are never
close enough to get any loot. Sound fair? I thought not. :)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">The best
solution I have seen so far is Alpha-looting. Looting in
alphabetical order, with one player keeping track of turns.
Determine ahead of time how it will be handled when a corpse has
no loot on it, whether you will continue in order or the person
that missed the loot gets to go again. Another method is dice
rolling, but that doesn't distribute the loot fairly like alpha
does.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">As far as money
goes, ALL group members should either have autosplit on or off.
It's not fair for one or two to share the money while others do
not. I personally suggest having it always on, then one does not
have to worry about forgetting (see Commands, above, for
instructions for turning autosplit on) and I think a good group
shares loot and money. Having autosplit on while soloing will
have NO effect on your take, there is noone to share with!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">The next topic
is casters and mana, healers and nukes in particular. Sometimes
the group gets a bit too excited and starts pulling too fast,
forgetting that the casters need to med. This is NOT a good idea!
A healer doesn't do much good when they are "OOM" (out
of mana) and the tank is getting his butt kicked! Nukes can't do
a thing either if they don't have enough mana to cast anything.
If you do not heed this advice you may find out the hard way how
important it is. Nothing like pulling that Wooley Mammoth you've
been dying to kill, having it get you down to 12 health, yelling
for help and hearing your healer or nuke yell back, "sorry,
I TOLD you I was OOM!!!"</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">And casters, it
is YOUR responsibility to tell your party you are OOM. Keep in
mind that at times the text if flying quickly by, don't be afraid
to yell it (in groupsay) repeatedly, best way is to type OOM in
caps.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">Ok, let's talk
about someone besides the casters now. How about our faithful
tanks? Tanks have a tough job too, not only do they have to find
good targets, take all the hits, and stay alive, but they have to
keep the casters from being attacked as well! Healer's need to
give the primary tank their priority and attention, always watch
his/her health bar! If he dies that monsters going to look for
something else to eat! Keeping your tank in one peice will keep
your own butt safe! Keep the tank buffed as well, especially SOW,
if available. It will make his pulling so much easier. Let him
know if you are not getting exp off his targets.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" size="3">All in all, the
most important thing to remember about grouping is that you are a
TEAM! Act like one! Always help each other, and always pay
attention to your primary job. A healer who is using all their
mana nuking is not doing a good job, neither is a tank that isn't
keeping monsters off the healer!<br>
