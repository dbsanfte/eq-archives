        The time has come to say goodbye, I'll miss you all and I know some if not most of you will miss me too. I wish you all the best in all you do and hope the Den lives long and will be respected as the great group of people it is.  <br> <br>I hope no one thinks that my leaving is because of anyone or anything to do with the guild. It's just time for me to move on with my life. Maybe I'll come back sometime to say hi. But I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you as it is easier on everyone if I don't come back at all. <br> <br>If anyone would like to keep in touch with me for any reason at all you can email me at: dartox@yahoo.com
