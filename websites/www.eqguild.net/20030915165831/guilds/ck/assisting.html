             <p>Thank you for that question. You assist by using a "social" key 
               you constructed before you arrived at the raid, and then dragged 
               to your hotkey panel. Some macro (social button) examples follow:

             <h3><i>When do I assist?</i></h3>
             <p>When you are instructed to by the main tank. The job of the main 
               tank is to get the mob only hitting on him/herself and solely focused 
               on killing the main tank. (we won't let the mob succeed, but they 
               don't know that). 
             <p>Once agro is established the Main Tank (MT) also called Main Assist 
               (MA) will call out in the raid channel <span class="chat">"Please 
               assist me in killing [mob name]"</span>, at which point you type 
               the number of your handy &lt;assist&gt; hotkey and begin doing whatever 
               your class does best to the mob (or your party members), at a pace 
               that will not get the mob's agro on yourself.
