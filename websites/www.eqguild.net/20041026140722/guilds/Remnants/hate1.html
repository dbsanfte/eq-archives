The Plane of Hate is a level 46+ zone that normally requires a raid to complete. It is the home of the god Innoruuk and his minions, including the Maestro of Rancor. This guide covers everything needed to successfully raid Hate, please read it all before attending a raid for the first time.<br><br>

Setting Up<br>
The Plane of Hate can only be accessed via a Wizard spell, Alter Plane: Hate. The spell requires a reagent known as a Soulstone of Innoruuk for each casting of the spell. Soulstones can be purchased in the Neriak Cleric guild for roughly 100 to 200pp depending on faction and charisma.<br><br>

Because Hate is not accessed from a normal zone line in a specific zone, a Hate raid can meet anywhere to prepare. I suggest meeting in Greater Faydark underneath the Wizard teleport spires. GFay is an ideal place to set up for a Hate raid because there is a city in the same zone, and melee can bind here.<br><br>

Before porting up into Hate, it is not necessary to buff everyone - in fact, it's a waste of mana and time to do so. The only people that should be buffed fully prior to porting up are the Clerics and Paladins (or anyone that can Revive)1. Everyone should be invisible before porting, however (execpt the Wizard, obviously). Groups should be set up so that everyone knows their group, but groups cannot be formed fully at this time because one slot in each group must be reserved for a Wizard to port up.<br><br>

The Run to SS (Safe Spot)<br>Once groups are set up, porting should begin one group at a time. The first group should be the pull group (notes on pull group later). After they are up, no other group should be ported until given the OK by one of the pull group's Rogues.<br><br>
If there are not enough Wizards present at the raid to have one in each group (which there probably won't be), the Wizard porting up groups should immediately gate out of the plane after porting up to get the next group.<br><br>

Upon zoning into Hate, all group members should immediately run the route to SS2 ( http://www.angelfire.com/ct2/diggle/HatemapSSRun.gif ) and camp there. When running along the zone wall as shown by the map, you are to run all the way ON MIDDLE of the wall. Even when SS is reached, you should camp at the top of the wall. All members of the group that can Revive are to be protected at all costs - if they are agroed on the way to SS, taunt the mobs off of them to attempt to buy them time to make their way to SS and camp. It is absolutely essential that at least one person that can Revive be camped at SS. If any non-Revivers are agroed on the way to camp, run off the wall3 to the ground, where you are to stand and die.<br><br>

Once everyone has either made it to SS or died, everyone should log in and Resurrections should be begin. Everyone should be buffed during this time as well. Note: all resses and buffing should take place at the top of the wall until the raid leader gives the OK to move down.<br><br>



If anyone on the raid is in possession of a Staff of Forbidden Rites, it is a good idea to hand this to a Rogue. This way, if no revivers make it to camp, the Rogue can use a charge of the staff to res a Cleric.<br><br>

The route to SS is marked by the blue line, and starts at the port up spot - marked (1) on the map.<br><br>
If you are agroed, it is best to run off the wall to the ground to die. This is because the walls of hate are slanted, sometimes making corpses very difficult to target for dragging. <br><br>



The Plane of Hate has a strange layout. It appears to be a city, with many different houses, but actually has two levels - both with ceilings - and yet is still considered an outside zone (i.e. SoW will work here). There is very little movement in Hate for everyone but the pull team. The majority of the raid will be spent sitting on the floor below the SS you ran to.<br><br>

This first SS has a few things to be noted. First, you will notice two Clerics and one Kiraikuei in the nearby Southwest corner of the zone. As long as the camp stays close together where the pull team instructs them to, you should not have to deal with these mobs often. Sometimes however, mob or pet pathing will cause one cleric and the kiraikuei to add. That being said, if this is a large raid, do not bother with pets. They will often cause more harm than good here.<br><br>
While fighting here, try to keep mobs off of the wall. Not only is fighting on the walls annoying for melees, if a mob dies here it's corpse can be very difficult to target for looting.<br><br>

Also, one person (preferably an Enchanter) should be appointed to dispel every mob as it enters camp. This is very necessary in Hate because of the many Cleric, Shaman, Magician, and Enchanter mobs that will be buffing each other like mad.<br><br>



Notes for the Main Tank<br>
The main tank for the raid should know what mobs to target first in multiple mob pulls. Remember however that no matter what the pull consists of, any mob that has been mezed should be skipped for un-mezed mobs first.<br><br>

Spite Golems are always the primary target in a multiple mob pull because of their very high magic resistance which makes them almost impossible to mez. The only time a Golem should not be the primary target is if there is a Cleric in camp that for some reason cannot be mezed. The next target, after Golems, should be Clerics. If all Golems and Clerics are dead, the order of targeting is not very important.<br><br> 

A good pull team is essential to Hate. The perfect set up for pull group in Hate is: Cleric - Shaman - Monk - Monk - Rogue - Rogue. This can be varied of course, but the group must have a Cleric and must have two Monks or Shadowknights. Also, at least one Rogue is suggested to make the raid move faster. Finally, if the pull group makeup does differ from this, remember not to place any Enchanters or tanks in the pull group.<br><br>

Clerics and Shaman<br>
The pull group needs it's own Cleric because the Monks will often need a quick heal, and will need buffs on demand to keep the raid running. A Shaman or Druid is suggested to keep buffs up as well. There are two main things to remember as the Cleric or Shaman / Druid for the pull group. First, do not waste mana fighting. The Monks and Rogues need whatever buffs they ask for, when they ask for it. The pull team determines how fast the raid moves. Secondly, never, ever cast anything on a Monk or Rogue while they're pulling unless they ask for it. Healing a Monk while they're not FDed or buffing a Rogue while he's scouting a house can cause a train that will wipe out the raid.<br><br>

Rogues<br>
A Rogue's role in Hate is to scout. Rogues are unique for this job because they are the only class in the game that can be invisible to both living and undead creatures at the same time, which is perfect for Hate. There are only four things in Hate that can see through a Rogue's Hide: Loathling Liches, Scorn Banshees, the Maestro, and Innoruuk himself.<br><br>

The Rogues in Hate do a number of jobs to help move the raid faster and make things easier for the Monks, including watching roamers and scouting houses. They are also, as always, very good for CR. The Rogues are normally in charge of the raid as they direct what to pull.<br><br>

A hidden Rogue will not cause aggression of mobs through walls or ceilings. However, Monks or anyone else that is not invisible will - keep this in mind while instructing the Monks what to pull.<br><br>

Finally, it is recommended that Rogues do not fight during the raid, except during Maestro and Innoruuk. This is to both keep them from accidentally training the camp by bringing back mobs they were not aware they had agroed, and also to keep them alive should the raid suffer a wipeout so that they can CR if needed.<br><br>

Monks<br>
Rogues are the scouts, but are most certainly not the pullers. The actual pulling of mobs in Hate should be done by a team of two Monks. One acts as the puller and one is the tagger. Before a pull, the tagger FDs at a specified spot (depending on what part of the zone is being pulled and which direction the pull will be coming from). The puller then runs out and pulls whatever told to by the Rogues, brings the mobs back to the tagger, and FDs next to him. A Rogue nearby watches the mobs and determines when to complete the pull. When told by the Rogue or the puller Monk, the tagger stands and brings the mobs to camp for killing.<br><br>

Notes<br>
Specific buffs are needed by the pull team which either the Cleric or Shaman should keep loaded at all times. Because Rogues will not be fighting, the only buff they should need is SoW. Monks however will require many different buffs, which the Cleric and Shaman should spilt up. Monks will need a HP / AC buff (Resolution, Heroism), an AC buff (Shield of Words), a symbol (Symbol of Naltron, Symbol of Marzin), a talisman (Talisman of Altuna), Disease and Poison resistances, SoW, and See Invisible.<br><br>

Both the puller and tagger should bring some sort of throwing weapon with them, or have a constant supply available to them from someone (Myrlokar's Bracer is ideal).<br><br>


Another Hate Map - Marked Safe Spots ( http://www.angelfire.com/ct2/diggle/HatemapDefault.gif )<br><br>

All Rogues and Monks should have a copy of this map during the raid. The suggested pulling order is as follows: Q R S C U V 2 3 4 5 A B 6 7 D P E N O F H J M G I L K 6.
<br><br>
Houses Q, R, S: These first three houses surround the SS. They can all contain kiraikueis, scorn banshees, and haunted chests. When pulling house S, the SW corner will often agro through the wall, and vice-versa. It is recommended that this house be pulled by first chain pulling the SW corner, and then pulling the house. The corner should be chained first because it takes the mobs in the house longer to path outside than it will take the mobs in the corner to path to the puller. After house Q is clear, it is safe to move the raid back a bit, to SS b.<br><br>

House C: This large house contains many mobs on both floors. Fortunately, because of the house's size, mobs from the second floor will not agro through the floor while pulling the first floor. This house can contain kiraikueis, clerics, forsaken revanants, spite golems, loathling liches, and ashenbone drakes. When pulling the first floor, clear all mobs except for the three static mobs by the exit to C near houses A and B. These mobs will cause houses A and B to agro if pulled now; it is best to leave them until later, after A and B are cleared. When pulling the second floor, a Rogue should watch for roamer aggression through the wall as the puller runs up the ramp.<br><br>

Houses U, V: These two houses can contain scorn banshees, kiraikueis, and haunted chests.<br><br>

Houses 2, 3, 4, 5, A, B, 6, 7: These houses can contain abhorrents, ire ghasts, haunted chests, and kiraikueis. The number houses are all clean pulls, but houses A and B will sometimes agro each other. Also, the three static spawns in C that were left alone earlier may add while pulling A and B, but they are much easier to deal with now.<br><br>

House D: This large house contains many mobs on the first floor, but only three on the second floor. It can contain any type of mob, and also houses the Maestro of Rancor, who sits in front of his organ in the Northwest corner of the first floor. As with house C, pulling mobs from the first floor will not agro mobs from the second floor, but when pulling the second floor roamers may agro through the wall as the puller runs up the ramp. Most of the mobs on the first floor roam around the floor. There are however two static spawns by the entrance of the house, and also two static spawns on each side of the Maestro's organ. It is not necessary to clear the second floor before pulling Maestro, but it is suggested that everything on the first floor be cleared before pulling Maestro. After house D is clear, the raid should be moved to SS c.<br><br>

House P: Pulling from house D does not cause aggression from house P, but pulling from house P will cause agro from house D - this is why P is pulled after D. It can contain scorn banshees, kiraikueis, and haunted chests.<br><br>

Houses E, N, O, F, H, J, M, G, I, L, K: These houses are located in the Northeast corner of the zone, also known as "Caster Corner." It is called this because all of these houses contain male or female revenants. House O however can contain scorn banshees as well.<br><br>

Upper Chambers: The Upper Chambers, or Innoruuk's Lair, of Hate are much smaller than the lower area. There are only three "houses," two small ones and one large one that houses Innoruuk himself. The large house is packed full of wandering mobs of any type. Innoruuk himself is stationary, standing all the way in the back of the house. Two ashenbone drakes stand at top of the ramp to the Upper Chambers. It is not necessary to move the raid up the ramp to pull the Upper Chambers, in fact it is recommended that the raid stay at SS c until all is clear but Innoruuk himself.<br><br>

Roamers<br>
There are two sets of roamer paths in Hate, each with about 4 - 6 mobs. Roamers are always loathling liches, revultant rats, or ire ghasts. They have a respawn time of anywhere from 30 - 45 minutes, and the drop rate on roamers is drastically lower than static spawns. Fortunately, none of the roamer mobs carry class armor. The SW corner has the same spawn time and drop rates as roamers.<br><br>

4 Enchanters and tanks are not placed in the pull group because the Cleric must keep his attention and mana saved for the Monks.<br><br>

5 An optional method of pulling mobs involves two Monks and a tank. The two Monks pull / tag like normal, but instead of having the tagger run the mob into camp, he FDs again just outside camp where a tank completes the pull with a ranged weapon. This can be difficult because the tank will probably not be in the pull group (see note 5), but it does ensure that the mob will go straight for the tank instead of possibly having the tagging Monk run it over a sitting caster, etc.
<br><br>
6 Note that this is merely a suggested order, it can be altered slightly. Also, note that house T is always empty, and houses 8 and 9 are not actually houses. 8 is a fountain, 9 is the giant spiral ramp to the upper chambers.<br><br> 

If there isn't enough time for clearing the entire Plane of Hate, certain areas of Hate can be skipped if the raid is trying to reach a specific class's armor, etc.<br><br>

Skipping to Northeast Corner<br>
The Northeast corner of Hate is often known as "Caster Corner" because this is where the majority of the Mage and Enchanter armor drops. This is often the last area to be pulled and sometimes there isn't enough time to reach it. There is good news for the casters however: this corner can be cleared in a separate, short "raid" on Hate without going through the normal pulling order.<br><br>

If the raid is going straight for NE Corner, groups are to stay in the portal up house after porting up. This will be the camping spot. Pullers should start by clearing the roamers on the south route, then proceed by clearing houses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. After these houses are cleared, the NE corner can be pulled. The only downside to pulling NE corner to the port up spot is the pullers will have to deal with both the north and south roamers.<br><br>

Skipping to Innoruuk<br>
Skipping to Innoruuk requires more time. The raid should start normally and clear all the way up to house D. After this is done, the raid can be moved to the Upper Chambers and begin clearing it, leaving house D and the NE corner popped. If the Northeast corner is skipped, Inny must be pulled in a special way. He cannot be fought where he stands in his house like normal, or the NE corner houses will agro through the floor. He must be pulled to just inside the entrance of his large house and fought there. <br><br>

The Maestro is the "mini boss" of Hate. He is a large vampire that sits in front of his organ in house D. His special attack is a particularly nasty one, making him at times harder than Innoruuk himself - an area effect lifetap. Maestro also has a chance to duel wield weapons, if he spawns with two of the special Bard weapons he can drop. When this happens, he is incredibly hard because magical weapons cannot be disarmed. A minimum of 18 people is suggested to attempt Maestro normally, more if he is duel wielding.<br><br>

Before buffing for Maestro, all of the first floor of house D should be cleared. This includes the four static spawns that guard him. Clearing these four spawns can be difficult to clear, just be patient. Even if an opportunity to pull Maestro alone before his guards are cleared presents itself, do not do it. The raid must be absolutely ready for him.
<br><br>
When he is ready to be pulled, everyone should be buffed fully. Because of his special AE attack, it is important that all casters be grouped together in the same spot, away from where he will be fought. Casters must also be careful of ping-ponging Maestro, this can be very dangerous. Finally, do not push Maestro up the wall.<br><br>

If casters stay together, watch their agro, and Maestro is kept in the same spot, the fight should go smoothly. If your raid defeats Maestro, it should have no problem with Innoruuk.<br><br>

The God of Hate and ruler of this plane is Innoruuk. He is actually slightly easier than Maestro, but is still worthy of respect. He will deathtouch every thirty seconds or so, and also casts an area effect gravity flux which will very quickly annoy the hell out of you. It appears to be much harder to resist than the normal gravity flux spell.<br><br>

Before charging Innoruuk, everyone should be buffed fully.     He will deathtouch the first person to reach him - plan for this, it shouldn't be a tank. Little actual strategy is involved - it's pretty much a straight up fight. He is not too much of a challenge if everyone is properly prepared for him.<br><br>

Introduction<br><br> 

This is a by the Rogue, to the Rogue, for the Rogue (and whoever else =) essay on the Rogue’s role in the Plane of Hate. Warriors, Rangers, Wizards, Monks, Clerics, Enchanters, Shamans, Druids, and Bards might also want to read this, because it might deal with them in some way or another regarding their own roles in Hate, unless I forget to add your role. Anyway, this is a compilation of my knowledge about the Plane of Hate, how to survive it, have fun with it, and maybe make a few people happy with some shiny new armor or weaponry. If you have any suggestions for improvement, or you just want to tell me that I don’t have a life, etc., feel free to spam the crap outta me at Hialai@hotmail.com. <br><br>

 

Bestiary <br><br>

Loathling Lich (a.k.a. Lich’s, LL’s):<br> 
CAN see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

(**Note** For some odd reason, if you un-sneakhide and re-sneakhide, you have a chance of making that Scowling, Ready to Attack Scorn or Lich into an Indifferent one. This may depend on your level, as well.)<br><br>

These things look like those spectres that harassed you at the Oasis Docks. With sound turned up you can make out a flapping noise that is most likely their cloaks billowing in the "wind." The aggro range for the average Lich seems to be quite small and slow, considering I’ve been face-to-face with a couple and got out of the way in time. However, I have been in several instances where Lich’s have aggroed me from almost double their usual aggro range, so tread carefully. The scythe they carry also works against them: It’s big. The tip of it tends to stick through walls to alert the scouting Rogue, but also note: get near that scythe and the Lich WILL come through the wall at you. Keep this in mind with other See-Rogue mobs, especially in two story houses (sneaking underneath a Banshee or Lich can aggro them, even if they’re on the upper floor of a house) and through the walls of the Cleric Hall / Church, since the SW Patrol Route winds around it. Lichs are usually the ones on patrol. They cast Wizard spells such as O`Keils Radiation (Level 4 Damage shield, does 2-4 damage per hit landed on it) and Gravity Flux (Potential Raid Destroyer. If a couple people get fluxed, they may attract mobs from the second floor of Hate. This means that a very angry mob of…mobs will be knocking on your door in about 40 seconds, less if Spite Golems are involved). These two spells are important to the Rogue because: Lich’s will stop to O`Keils every single mob it patrols by (Lichs are almost always on Patrol, making them your worst enemy and very, very annoying.) While the Lich (or any mob) is casting a spell, it will not be able to aggro you. This could be a window of opportunity should you want to get by it with minimal risk. Also, the Lich turns to face the mob it casts on, keep that under consideration. As far as I know, Lich’s drop platinum, some nice gems and no-effect jewelry, and a Necro only staff, which, to my knowledge, is nowhere near good but is used for some Necromancer quest.<br><br>

Scorn Banshee (a.k.a. Scorns, Banshees, SB’s):<br> 
CAN see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

They look like a Female Zombie but twice as tall. When standing around, they make a low moaning sound. You can use this sound to determine whether or not there is a Scorn Banshee in the house you’re standing right next to. Banshees tend to spawn in the Maestro Hall and the South Wall Houses (including some on the SW-W wall). Their aggro range is a bit larger than the Lich’s and they love to come through walls / ceilings at you. You will notice this very quickly in the house on the W wall that is almost embedded into the Maestro hall, where almost always 2 banshees and a Haunted Chest spawn. They hit for the usual, and also have a chance to proc a very powerful disease on you. Aside from the proc they do not cast spells of any kind. Scorn Banshee’s drop the Bard "Imbrued" armor rarely, as well as the "Martune Rapier," a mediocre bard weapon and Side Quest Item of the Rogue Epic Quest (Not required for completion of the quest, however. Just for the Jagged Diamond Dagger if you somehow lost it or want another one). Also dropped is the usual plat / gems / jewelry that all the Hate Mobs drop, so I’ll refrain from mentioning it further. Also, after a Scorn Banshee dies, there is a chance that it will pop a Thought Destroyer right on the spot that the Banshee died.<br><br>
An Abhorrent (a.k.a. Abhors, Abs): <br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

Our friends the Abhorrents. =) They appear to be larger-than-usual Gargoyles. You can tell they’re near from the sound of their flapping wings. To help you better understand where they spawn, find a map of Hate. Take a pencil, and put it on the "Fountain" in the middle of the zone, East of the Spiral Staircase leading to the Second Floor. Draw a straight line south of that fountain. Now draw a line from the Fountain to the South East corner of the zone, and you will have the general area where Abhorrents spawn. You can also sight them occasionally in houses around the Cleric Hall, inside the Cleric Hall, and inside the Maestro Hall. The Abhorrent is classified as a Rogue. This means it can Backstab a large hole in your ass should you slow down while pulling it. As with all Rogues, it cannot cast spells. Abhorrents drop the renowned "Woven Shadow" armor, Rogue only. It is also possible for them to drop a "Shrieking Ahlspiess," a mediocre piercing weapon that looks nice in your Ranged Slot. I’ve also noticed that Woven Shadow Gloves and the Helm seem to drop more often than Bracers, BPs, Legs, and Vambracers, etc.<br><br>

Haunted Chest (a.k.a. Boxes, Chests, Da Box, etc.):<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

These things are just what their name makes them out to be: Oversized treasure chests with teeth inside. They don’t seem to make a sound till they start fighting, but they can’t see you, so if you bump into one don’t worry. (FYI: A bug makes it so that some Boxes will Scowl at you, ready to attack – don’t worry, it’s not true. You can walk up and /poke them if you like, they wont aggro.) Haunted Chests seem to spawn in set areas in the zone, and they always spawn, no PHs. I believe they spawn in the house embedded in Maestro (Maestro Hall), one in the Southwest Corner, one in the house directly in front of the Maestro Hall Entrance, and one near the SE Corner houses. There may be more. Boxes seem to be warriors, so no spells and no procs. Boxes have a rare chance of dropping any piece of armor (not off a God or mini boss) from the Planes of Hate and Fear. The pulling of Haunted Chests is sometimes cause for celebration. People tend to like oversized boxes trying to tear their faces off or something, depends on whom you gate up with. Also, some boxes are pretty annoying to pull. They tend to get stuck in their spawn point for a while until they finally decide to go for the puller, so try to stay as close as possible when pulling them.<br><br>

A Kirakuei (a.k.a. Kira’s, mummies, Kirakuei spelled wrong in every way possible =):<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue <br><br>

Kirakueis appear to be extra-large mummies. They make a low moaning sound that seems very close to what Scorn Banshee’s make; so don’t be fooled into thinking it’s a Kirakuei and not a Scorn Banshee. I have yet to determine if the pitches of both moans are different, but you may be able to find out yourself. Kira’s spawn around and about, scattered far in pretty much every area of the zone except the NE Corner, which is primarily Revenants of both genders. Kirakuei’s are monks, judging how they vertically jump five feet into the air to kick the (taller) tanks right in the teeth. Kirakuei’s drop the warrior "Indicolite" armor, as well as a special Shuyruken (spelling?) that makes a nice battle scar in your range slot.<br><br>

An Ire Ghast (a.k.a. Ire’s, Ghasts, SKs, Puller Killers)<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<B></B>

These appear to be Ghouls on steroids. They make a very loud, very annoying rhaspy inhaling sound that alerts you to their presence. Ghasts are mainly on Patrol, but some statics (non-patrols, tend to drop armor / weaponry at a vastly increased rate than patrols, which seem to not drop any armor at all) can spawn in the areas around the Fountain and SE Corner. The most irritating fact about the Ghasts are that they are not only everywhere but they are Shadow Knights. This means a Harm Touch coming the way of whoever’s on the top of the aggro list. It tends to knock about two bubbles of life off a monk per touch. The reason why Ghasts are so dangerous to pullers is that they like to move in groups or stay nearby to each other, (**Note** There is a house East-ish of the Maestro Hall that seems to spawn two ghasts in it, always. It is right next to a new mob ((Knight, Disciple, etc. of Innoruuk)) that spawns by the fountain) so what looks like one ghast can turn into two or more, and then a dead Monk, whose charred corpse you have to drag back to a Cleric for a rez, slowing the pulling process down and ticking some people off. Ire Ghasts drop a 1hB "Water Sprinkler," used mainly by pets with bored owners. =) <B></B>

A Revultant Rat (a.k.a. Rats)<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

These are your average sized, friendly neighborhood homicidal diseased rats. They make an almost constant "squee squee squee" noise that will drive you mad with prolonged exposure. These things are always on patrol, I have never seen a static. Rats can take center stage in a Hate Raid at times, because once they start spawning, they really start spawning. You will see it when it happens: Rat invasion. Nothing but rats on patrol for hours, which can be a good thing; it could be all Ire Ghasts. Rats are warriors, and can proc a Poison spell that makes it a good idea for Clerics to memorize Cure Poison spells prior to Rat Fights. These rodents can drop a Ranger-only "Revultant Whip," 1hs 5 / 14 with some other stats.<br><br>

Forsaken Revenant (a.k.a. Revs)<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

These things look like a paler, average-sized version of Dark Elves. They come in Female and Male forms. If you can’t tell the Male from the Female version you need your eyesight checked. =) They make no discernable noise as I recall, except maybe for their spellcasting. They always spawn in the NE corner, taking up about a quarter of the zone. Some have also been spotted in the Maestro Hall (Come to think of it, they kinda look like the Maestro) and Cleric Hall. The Male versions are Magicians that may have pets. They have AoE rains and nukes. The Female versions are Enchanters, and also possibly have pets. I believe they use every spell in their repertoire except Charm. Male Rev’s drop the Magician "Apothic" armor, and a charged Mag-only wand. The Females drop Enchanter "Insidious" armor, and I believe an Enchanter wand of the same style as the Magician. I believe both revenants drop the Essence of the Vampire, a component of the Enchanter Epic Quest.<br><br>

Spite Golem (a.k.a. Golems, Spites)<br>
Can NOT see a Sneaking Rogue<br><br>

Nektulos Forest stone golems revisited. I’m pretty sure they’re the ones who make a very quiet grunt if you’re nearby. Spite Golems tend to spawn in the Cleric Hall, Maestro Hall (especially around the Maestro himself), and various other places in proximity to the SE Corner and second floor. Spite Golems are Shamans, no pets. They cast Shaman buffs such as SoW (on themselves only, thankfully) and other Shaman buffs. They drop the Shaman "Rune Etched" armor and possibly a "Spitestone Shield". As mentioned before these things cast SoW, and are therefore fast. If pulled they are guaranteed to hit the Monk before anything else gets there, most likely causing an FD out of the monk. Keep this in mind if attempting to pull a certain mob. If the Monk has a Dodge / Riposte discipline, tell him to use it in those scenarios. As mentioned before, these things have SoW and are therefore fast. They are also completely magic resistant. Your only hope is to Annul Magic them at least five times to make sure you get rid of that SoW, before it starts running.<br><br>

Cleric of Innoruuk (a.k.a. Clerics)<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

These mobs resemble extra-large Neriak guards. They make no noise except for their spells. Clerics of Innoruuk spawn in the Cleric Hall (/duh), Maestro Hall, and occasionally a patroller that walks right up the South wall in the SE corner. In case you haven’t already figured it out, these things are Clerics, capable of buffing (Resolution) and Complete Healing any nearby mobs. They have high MR and aren’t the most Mez-Friendly mobs in the zone. Since they are able to CH, you want to keep them stunned non-stop when they reach about 45% health or they will complete heal themselves (or any other mob at about 40% health in range). When fighting in the SW Corner you must note that if you move the mobs you fight too far North, nearby Clerics in the Maestro Hall will (unless previously killed) CH them. If the mob is CH’ed, however, this does not mean that you have aggroed the Cleric in question. It turns out their casting range is a lot longer than their aggro range. They drop the Cleric "Ethereal Mist" armor, as well as a Cleric only shield (which appears on the Cleric of Innoruuk’s arm should he have it).<br><br>

Ashenbone Drake (a.k.a. Drakes, Ash Drakes, Ashens, AshyB, etc.)<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

These things are miniature versions of the Dracoliche in the Plane of Fear. Well, miniature to the Dracoliche. These things are about 20 ft / 6.3 m long skeletons of dragons. They are big. Their aggro range is big. The range at which they attract friends to help fight with them is very, very big. Pull them and you’re guaranteed to pull a friend or two with them. They don’t make any sound I am aware of, but I don’t see them often. They spawn occasionally in the Maestro and Cleric Halls, and two always guard the top of the Spiral Ramp leading to the second floor of the zone. The drakes are most likely Necromancers, and can cast Fear on a member of the raid. If not resisted, this member will run, screaming like a lunatic, away from the camp and deep into the zone. If you see this happening, have the Clerics camp. Getting Feared pretty much guarantees a train to be incoming. Ashenbones drop no class specific armor, but some weaponry instead. This includes the "Ashbone Axe, Abassi, Shield, and Warhammer."<br><br>

The Thought Destroyer (a.k.a. The Thought Destroyer =)<br>
CAN see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

This is a female zombie that spawns immediately after the death of some Scorn Banshees. No sound I’m aware of, besides, she always comes out fighting at the exact spot of the death of the Scorn Banshee. Smacked me for quad 100+’s when I got in her way. Not sure if she is a class other than Warrior. Drops a Paladin "Tainted Darksteel Breastplate," a component of the Fiery Avenger Quest.<br><br>

The Maestro of Rancor (a.k.a. Maestro, Mae, The Maestro)<br>
CAN see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

A mini-boss of the Plane of Hate. He is a level 56 Bard. Kinda looks like a Vampire / Dark Elf with a flowing red cape and a little crown. I don’t think he makes a sound, but it would be cool if he played some organ music when he’s in front of that thing. Btw, he spawns in front of the Organ of Rancor, a really, really big pipe organ, in the back corner of the Maestro Hall (/duh again). A Rogue can sneak behind him, but must be careful. The Maestro spawns in between several Clerics or Spite Golems that buff him whenever they can. When the Maestro is being buffed, he will turn to face whatever is casting on him. He is a Bard, and has an AoE Lifetap which can get pretty annoying. Once killed (atleast 20 people to do it, I’d say) he drops many items, such as "The Hand of the Maestro," a hard to get NO DROP component of the Warrior Epic Quest. Also dropped are many Bard items such as the "Mempo of Likato" (Spelling?), "Basoon Haste Gauntlets," Kelin’s Seven-Stringed Lute," and the "Evensong," a Bard Mace.<br><br>

Hand of the Maestro<br>
Can NOT see a sneak hiding Rogue<br><br>

This cute little bugger spawns right under the Maestro of Rancor in the Maestro Hall. He’s about level 40, but is still an interesting fight. After he dies, a "very unpleasant hand" will spawn where it died. This thing is a lot tougher than the original Hand, and always drops the Hand of the Maestro. Keep in mind both Hands are very fast little buggers.<br><br>

High Priest M`Kari (a.k.a. High Priest, Priest, M`Kari, etc.)<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

A mini-boss that spawns in the back of the Cleric Hall in front of a throne, guarded on either side by Clerics of Innoruuk. Looks like an extra-large Cleric. No sounds I’m aware of, but he’s not that hard to miss, judging by his size. He is a level 56 Cleric, and hits for upwards of 200. When killed, he always drops two pieces of the Cleric Ethereal Mist armor and parts of Innoruuk’s old loot table. In one case he dropped the Shattered Emerald of Corruption, part of the Ranger Epic Quest.<br><br> 

Mistress of Scorn (a.k.a. variations of the real name)<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

Mini-Boss of the plane, she spawns in the second floor of the Cleric Hall, above where High Priest M`Kari spawns on the first floor. She is an extra large scorn banshee, guarded by a good amount of statics on the second floor. Has the same statistics as the High Priest, barring Cleric abilities. She drops two pieces of the Bard Imbrued armor every time, as well as something from the Old Innoruuk. Either she or the Ashenbone Broodmaster drops the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Fire, a new Magician only item that improves the abilities and increases the size of any post-50 Fire Pets.<br><br>

Ashenbone Broodmaster (a.k.a. variations of the name)<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

A slightly smaller than the real thing Dracoliche. Spawns in the Cleric Hall, across and to the left of the Mistress of Scorn. Again, approximately the same statistics, except this thing is an Ashenbone Drake variation. I’m not sure exactly what he drops, but it is again a piece of Innoruuk. One item I know is the Encyclopedia Necrothurgia, a necromancer focus item that improves the abilities of pets summoned while holding the book, and handy for looking up how to spell "Necrothurgia".<br><br>

Evangelist of Hate (a.k.a. The Evangelist)<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

This guy is worse than those Jehovah’s Witnesses knocking on your door at 8 am. Spawns on the second floor of Hate, surrounded by a horde of new mobs (Disciples, Sages, Knights of Innoruuk). Level 56, looks like an extra large cleric, and holds a Shadowed Book for some reason, possibly filler for an item not yet put into the game. He came through the ceiling once to pay the raid a visit, possibly on a mission to convert us.<br><br>

Battlemaster?<br><br> 

Not entirely sure where he spawns, what he is, or what he does. From what I can divine he is a level 56 monk that drops a Monk "Rakusha Cloak" and two pieces of Warrior Indicolite armor every time. I was not able to find him on two separate occasions, looking on both first and second floors in their entirety.<br><br>

Knights, Sages, Disciples of Innoruuk, Elite Dragoons, and Innoruuk’s Chosen<br>
Can NOT see a sneak / hiding Rogue<br><br>

I don’t have Velious yet, and I hear these things are some pretty elaborately dressed Dark Elves. From what I can tell, they’re a bunch of naked or robed extra-large Dark Elves. The Knight is a Shadow Knight, ranging from 54 to 56, that rarely drops a fine steel sword (/gasp) or a "Darkmetal Falchion," 1hs, 23 / 29 +7 wis / int, PAL / SHD only. The knight will hold the sword (and its hard to miss, looks cool) when he has it. Sages are some kind of caster, possibly wizards. They drop a crappy Nec / Wiz / Mag / Enc 10 ac Robe, and another one that looks like a red version of a Necromancer Blighted Robe. Disciples of Innoruuk are possibly Druids, and drop the Druid Harmonic armor. Innoruuk’s Chosen don’t seem to do much, but they’re around. Elite Dragoons are the main patrollers of the walls of Hate. All these mobs pop on the second floor of Hate, in static or patrol positions.<br><br>

Innoruuk (a.k.a. Inny, Inno, Yo’ Daddy)<br>
CAN see a sneak / hiding Rogue (and you’re sooo dead when he does =)<br><br>

The big man himself. Looks like a three story tall green-colored Dark Elf in the Deity-only "I’m a Pansy With a Cape" armor. Don’t think he makes any sounds, then again I’ve never lived to get close enough. That guy turns around a lot. Spawns on the second floor of the Plane of Hate itself, and tends to wander around one very large house almost adjacent to the spiral ramp up there. He makes appearances at the SE corner, home of the GGP (Group Gate-In Point) and Death Touches anyone who gets too high on the wall. I think he’s a Necromancer. Drops a bunch of nice stuff post-patch now, but until we all drop him some more I wont list it. His original loot (minus Vexthorne, I hear) has been moved to mini bosses scattered around the zone.<br><br>

The Rogue’s Guide to Hate (Before the Gate Up)<br><br> 

Supplies: You may want to grab a Gate Potion before you go up, purchasable at any Alchemy shop in Norrath. You’ll want to get 80 bread and 80 water before you go up, or at least stock up on food / water, 80 is my preference. SoW potions only if you know a Druid, Shaman, or Ranger isn’t gating up with you, but that is most likely not the case. You may also want to get some Throwing Daggers and Arrows if a Magician isn’t coming up, daggers for the Monk, Arrows for the Puller. Out of courtesy you can always grab some extra Peridots for your Cleric. Also, a Staff of Rites (10 Charges of Resurrection) can work wonders if all the Clerics and Paladins are dead, and you’ve made sure that no one else in the entire plane is alive that can rez.<br><br>

Armor: Everything AC. You will not have a fighting role in the Hate Raid unless another Rogue is going to be the Scout. If you’re not scouting, then what are you reading this section for? =) AC because if you get spotted by something (Lich, Banshee), you’re going to want to run, screaming like a madman back to the pull spot and wait. If you were lucky and only pulled 1-2 mobs, congratulations, you might not die…if the Puller is fast enough to get the mobs off you. AC is a crucial component in this area. Also, bring your Epic if you have it. Looks nice, gives 100 Hp and 9 ac. To this day I don’t know anyone who has lost a corpse in Hate. Fear yes, but not Hate. =) <br><br>

Also: Make a list of the people in charge of the raid. You’ll want to stay in communication with them for what the raid wants to do, where you’re going, etc. Also get the names of the group leaders. In the case of mass-death, you’re going to want to tell those leaders to have their groups consent you for the Corpse-Drag-O-Thon.<br><br>

Gating Up<br><br> 

Despite popular opinion, you are not invincible. If you catch anyone saying that "Rogues don’t need an invis, they have Hide," /bonk them on the head and ask for an invis. The GGP, Group Gate In Point, is also the stopping point for a patrol route that consists Lichs, Ghasts, etc. There is also a house full of friendlies about 15 feet away from the exact point you zone in. Should you zone in nearby one of these mobs, the odds are that lag and the nature of human musculature will prevent you from hitting your Hide key before the mob aggros. Make sure you get an Invis, See Invis, and SoW before you gate up. Now you should be ready to enter the Plane.<br><br>

Your wizard begins to cast a spell…<br><br>

You have entered the Plane of Hate<br><br> 

HIDE AND SNEAK IMMEDIATELY<br><br> 

…and it just might save your life. Keep in mind that this part of the guide follows the strategy to use if your raid is breaking the zone from the GGP, seeing as camping on the wall is now impossible thanks to the patch. Anyway, if your group has not aggroed the patrol and friends, have the Cleric of your group (you did bring one, didn’t you? =) quickly move to the dead middle of the Eastern Wall. The East one. Not the South one. Not the top of the wall, nor the bottom. In between north and south. Got that? Now have that cleric camp out there, get on an alt, and start praying. Have the wizard gate the next groups up. Make it a point that you will have the balls of anyone who touches the walls of the GGP house. Stuff comes through walls very easily if you’re close to said walls. In addition, no one but the Puller, Monk, and you should even be close to the door of the house. Even taking a cautious look outside it will result in a large hole in your ass, compliments of that Abhorrent you just aggroed. After the groups have been gated in, and your groups’ cleric has safely gotten back to camp, begin pulling. The Monk should pull the mobs to either the East wall in range of the alley that connects it to the GGP ent, or 15 feet directly out from the GGP ent, where the puller, standing back from the doorway, should have an easy time hitting the mobs with an arrow. Keep in mind, that if anyone is close to the walls, pulled mobs will aggro through the walls. Either a tough fight or an annoying CR ensues.<br><br>

The First Rule of Fight Club… <br><br>

Once you’re safely in camp, remove Sneak / Hide and tell your group the following rules:<br><br>

1. Never cast on me unless I tell you to. <br><br>

2. Never cast on me unless I tell you to. <br><br>

3. As a Scout I don’t need any form of Offensive buff. This means Speed (Alacrity, Swift Like the Wind, etc.), Strength or Dexterity buffs, damage shields, etc.<br><br>

4. As a Scout I WILL need any form of Defensive buff you can throw at me. This means Cleric AC, Cleric Symbol, Cleric Hero / Reso or Druid Natureskin / Skin Like Nature (They’re different spells, really). Rune is a bit of a Mana waster, but if your Enc wants to don’t stop him =). Agility, Shaman Symbols / Health if you can muster it.<br><br> 

5. No heals unless I say. This works under Rule #1 but sometimes a Cleric can forget that. If you’re on the floor, standing right next to a Cleric of Inny, and suddenly get casted on, you’re screwed. If you are wounded for some reason, however, move back to the camp, /poke the Cleric, and ask for a quick heal. All these rules go for the Monk as well. This is crucial.<br><br> 

6. Depending on your tactics, the Monk keeps See Invis on permanently. Magician summoned sticks (level 16 one, I believe, have 5 charges of See Invis). This is so he can see you when you’re dragging him around the zone to show him what you want pulled next.<br><br> 

(If you have a 55+ Mage with Call of the Hero) Get him in your group. Tell him to mem CoH and to never un mem it until he’s clear out of the Plane. =)<br><br>

***READ*** <br><br>

On CoH: For those of you who are unaware, Call of the Hero is a Magician only Summon Player Spell. If you’re grouped with the Mage and in the same zone, the Magi can cast it on you, summoning you to right in front of the caster. CoH completely clears any and all aggro on you except for one thing: a mob was casting on you and did not complete the spell before you were CoH’ed. This will keep the aggro and most likely send the mobs at you. If you think this happened, have yourself and the mage run to the floor and hit /q immediately. It just might save your life. CoH also works wonders should the Monk be bugged (due to FD nerfs, some mobs may remember the Monk the moment he stands up, sending said mobs and everything around them straight towards the Monk’s location. CoH removes this bug should it occur.)<br><br>

Your Very Own Pet Monkey <br><br>

The Monk is now your weapon. You are now in charge of what the Hate Raid will pull. This is very important. If people think that you don’t want to pull the mob that drops their armor on purpose they will most likely want to leave the raid. In the case of Clerics / Warriors / Enchanters, this is bad. You want to work on satisfying everyone’s needs, including your own. Luckily there are lots of diversely populated areas near the Abhorrents. =) Here’s a basic battle plan of what you want to do:<br><br>

A Plan is a Set Series of Events that Never Happen <br><br>

Have the monk begin to pull towards the South West Corner. This entails a crapload of patrolling mobs, as well as 4 or 5 houses situated on the South Wall. You will also want to pull the houses around you, so that you wont get adds mid fight. After the way is clear, have the entire raid pack up and move to the SW Corner. Have everyone stay on the floor of the SW Corner. Anyone that casts a spell from the wall, sits on the wall, or does anything on the wall should be removed from the raid. It is possible that "an evil little imp" brigade will spawn in the SW Corner. This is OK, considering that these things are wimps. Anyway, the new pull spot for the SW corner will be the area along the West Wall, near the SW corner. From here on out you will want to pull the remaining SW Corner houses, moving onto the Cleric Hall. Fight the mini-bosses and score some loot if you are able to. After the Cleric Hall has been cleared, pull the houses around it, and move onto the Maestro Hall. Clear the hall, and have the entire raid move to the niche in the Mae Hall. You can reach this niche by entering the Maestro Hall and hugging the wall to your left. You will see two small hallways. The one on the right has a throne. That is where you want to go. From here on out you can pull the Maestro, second floor, the NE Corner, or the SE corner easily, as well as the Second Floor. Depending on what the raid wants, you may want to pull the second floor and clear Innoruuk’s House, and have the raid move up there to pull the rest of the floor. <br><br>

By now you will have removed a good portion of the zone and are working your way to becoming a fully-fledged Scout. It’s pretty much self-explanatory from here on in, but there are a few things you should know about.<br><br>

Oh Shit…<br><br> 

…are usually the last words your party will hear before you bite the big one – if you don’t know what to do. This should cover enough so that your group won’t hear your last words. =) In the event of you losing your cover or a Banshee / Lich thinks you’ve had enough for the night, you will be notified with a large amount of the color Red (if you’ve set it for that) on your chat screen, usually in the form of being hit for 100+ damage. The first thing you have to do is<br><br>

DO NOT PANIC!<br><br>

I cannot stress that enough. Panic enough and you won’t even be able to hit your hotkey (you did make a hotkey, right? =) that you’ve been aggroed and are on your way back with friendlies. Now the scenario can go one of a few ways:<br><br>

You have a competent mage who summons you the moment you give the word. Keep in mind Call of the Hero has a 12 second casting time. Don’t stop running until you’re back in the camp. <br><br>

You do not have a Magician, and run like crazy back to the spot where the Monk feigns death (in front of the Arch, usually). Calmly tell your puller to get ready in case there aren’t as many as you think there are. In the event of two, possibly 3 mobs, have the puller run up and try to get them off you. Since you’re aggroed, feel free to help in the fight. If your puller takes a while in choosing whether to come down or not, hit your Discipline of Counterattack or Discipline of Nimble if you have them, it’ll cover your ass for 10+ more seconds than you would normally have survived.<br><br> 

You do not have a Magician, run back to your Monk Point =) and the puller takes too long. You die, and perform what we call in the business a RD Pull (Real Death Pull). Nothing big, just get a rez, yell at the puller, and get back to work.<br><br> 

What should NOT happen: You panic, and die at the spot nearby (or farther from) where you were standing. If you’re lucky another Rogue might be able to drag your ass back to camp. If no other Rogue is available, get the Monk to try. If this doesn’t work, pray a necro brought a coffin up.<br><br>

Wait a sec – did you just heal me? (Alai, 12.43 seconds before a lich kills his Cleric)<br><br>

In the event of someone casting on the Monk while he’s aggroed, and situations involving more mobs than your group can handle, it is mainly your responsibility to shout the simple words, "CLERICS CAMP!" Now hopefully you have a good group and they understand that they must guard a cleric or two long enough for them to camp out. Regardless, make it known that you have survived (You shouldn’t be fighting) and to have everyone on the raid /consent you. You did get a list of all the group leaders, right? Get everyone’s corpse to the camp spot for the Clerics to rez. Now is a perfect time for the Monk to /q out to clear aggro if that was the case. If the Clerics are unaware of the Rezzing Order, it is: Clerics – Enchanters – Bards – Other Casters – Casting Tanks – Non-Casting Tanks. Feel free to switch things around as you see fit, however. <br><br>

Location, Location, Location <br><br>

Once you have cleared the first floor of the Maestro hall, leading up to the Maestro himself (Don’t have to pull him), have the raid move into the corner of the Maestro Hall closest to your camp on the first floor. To get there, just enter the Hall, and hug the left wall until you get to a little throne with a firepot or two on its sides. To get everyone to the door of the Maestro Hall safely, either kill the patrollers, or wait for a break in the patrol. Inform the raid that it has to get ready to hop on the floor and follow you ASAP. At the moment of this break in patrol, shout to follow you to the hall. After everyone is situated at the Throne and the Pots, outline the pull area to the Monk and Puller. This area is the large, open space just past the doors of the Maestro Hall. It gives the Monk plenty of room to see what’s coming, and the Warrior plenty of distance from the mobs he’s pulling. <br><br>

After you’ve set the pulling area up, continue scouting the zone at your discretion. You can opt for the more diverse pulls of the South Wall and South East Corner, or the Enchanter and Magician-gear dropping mobs of the North East Corner. Depending on your raid you may want to kill the Maestro and his pet hand.<br><br>
