She is my Queen 

<br><br><br>

A heart that lays heavy with a loss never owned<br>
A dream that haunts although dreams never come<br>
Belonging in a world where evil and hate is hidden within<br>
Meeting a queen by chance, through kindness, and in love, I drowned.<br><br>

To be re-born into a life that’s now fulfilled<br>
Never sensing the power that this queen could hold<br>
A heart that lays heavy waiting for a touch from her soul<br>
And to know in my mind the powers will unfold in her hands<br><br>

The struggle to survive in a world so harsh and unkind<br>
Without purpose, direction, no hope just to wander the lands<br>
How one person unknown can know such a dream<br>
To show Love, to show hate, to show silence so loud<br><br>

My queen, I beg thee, show me your love and your light<br>
Show me your strengths, your softness, my weakness, my fate<br>
I am but a pawn with a need to belong<br>
In a world that can love me, love us, for we are one.<br><br><br>
