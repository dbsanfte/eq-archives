<table>

<tr><td><img src="Batavia.JPG" width=500></td><td>Batavia Soulweaver, Mistress of the Covenant.  Screenshot (and Tree Weave) courtesy of Siafore Silverspur, Legion of Might.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="wurm1.JPG" width=500></td><td>A Wurm in Burning Woods thinks we'll be an easy meal.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="wurm2.JPG" width=500></td><td>Well, he was wrong!</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="ladcleavage1.JPG" width=500></td><td>Ladwenae gets her Treeweave armor in Burning Woods, helped by Rumtumm, Iulan, Mutleedog, and Batavia.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="ladcleavage2.JPG" width=500></td><td>Iulan, the dog he is, stares at Ladwenae's cleavage.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">*No Image Available*</td><td>Iulan was not available for either comment or photos after being defeated by Batavia in single combat.  One onlooker said she heard Iulan scream at the beginning of the duel:  'Hey!!  Where did everything go???'</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="seru4.JPG" width=500></td><td>This lovely paradise is Sanctus Seru, on Luclin.  This lunar city has most trainers and tradeskill vendors available.  Sanctus Seru is centrally located to several hunting grounds of levels 20+, including Dawnshroud Peaks, The Grey, Marus Seru, and the Scarlet Desert.  It is usually quite deserted.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="NurgaWaterfall.jpg" width=500></td><td>"Um, we are supposed to <i>JUMP??</i>"  That was heard more than once during our guild's trip to the Mines of Nurga.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="seru2.JPG" width=500></td><td>Another view of Sanctus Seru.  Surely, Luclin has a LOT more to offer than just graphics.</td></tr>

<tr><td><img src="ladmonkey.JPG" width=500></td><td>Ladwenae Imadane is more fun than a barrel full of monkeys!  Now we see why!!  *grin*</td></tr>
