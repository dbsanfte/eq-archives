<h4>Role:</h4>

Our primary purpose is to keep the lands in which we travel safe for 
all the adventurers of Norrath. The highest honor a Celestial Knight can 
achieve is to die in battle in defense of another's life. We value 
honor, courage, respect, wisdom, and loyalty above all other virtues. These 
govern everything we are and do. 

<h4>Goals:</h4>

<ol>
<li> To achieve a high level of proficiency in various race/class 
combinations allowing us to assist guild members and other honorable 
adventurers in achieving their goals within the lands of Norrath. 

<li> To effectively portray our respective races/classes such that they 
enhance the experiences of other adventurers. 

<li> To be a model adventurers for others to emulate. 

<li> To have all characters either in the guild or no-tagged (for escape 
purposes) as our guild consists of the person at the keyboard, not 
individual characters.
</ol>

<h4>Basic Guild Guidlines:</h4>

The following tenants are established as a basic guidline for guild 
organization and are the foundation of our guild bylaws. They will always 
include, but are not limited to the following: 

<ul>
<li>We are established to provide adults the opportunity to role-play 
characters in a dependable and mature environment. 

<li>Guild membership will be open to adults only. 

<li>Members may play any combination of race, class, or religion that is 
available.

<li>Organization and government will be in a round table table format with 
each member having an equal vote. The guild master will be a non-voting 
member except in deciding a tie. 

<li>Cheating in any way, shape, or form will not be tolerated. Bug abusers 
or hackers will be dismissed immediately. Bugs are to be reported to 
the EQ staff immediately. 

<li>The use of questionable play tactics such as kill stealing, excessive 
camping at spawn points, etc. shall not be practiced. 

<li>Rules of conduct are in accordance with those specified in the user 
agreement. Additionally, no member of the guild will be involved in public 
(broadcasted) personal attacks (ie. /Shout or /OOC). Any arguments 
shall be handled one on one (/Tell) and shall not be abusive or offensive. 
</ul>
