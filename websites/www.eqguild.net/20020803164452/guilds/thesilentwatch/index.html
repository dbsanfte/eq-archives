<p align="left">Every warrior has their own method of taunting a mob.  Some have banks of hotkeys setup, others sit down a lot, some even train points in it... but Mega has his own method:
<p>

<p align="left">Now thats taunt!  So, since the last update we've killed Servitor of Luclin for items no one wanted, as well as Praetorian for much of the same... then completed an 8th Shawl War for Darkivy, grats!  We then jogged over to KD and 'nutted Derakor the Vindicator one, grats to Jerusalem on BP, and Daldur on head!  We also did a spot of HoT farming but the drops...just...plain...sucked.  But, all that pales to our latest kill... this evening, we felled:
<p>
<center><img src="doze1.gif"></center>
<p align="left">Dozekar the Cursed fell on our third try this evening, after everything from surprise charges, to adds galore, to the final beatdown.  Great night and a sweet final kill with only 2 deaths.  Grats Thurlin on Flame Kissed Tear, Mega on Black Tear and meeehh on a Platinum Tear.  I'm off to the Pizza shop in Houghton to get my pizza, stay frosty bitches!

<p align="left">Ahhh how things change with time... our first Cazic Thule kill was made in just over 10 minutes in a lag fest in the Plane of Fear with oh so many dead... but today, the big ugly bastard fell in 3 minutes 4 seconds to only 6 dead:

I was just loving it, everything went off perfectly, CT stayed where we put him, and he just fell over dead, can't ask for more.  Was a bit of a caster clean sweep today as well, <b>Brain for Granuaile, Robe for Tilamven and Eye for Conjurous</b>, grats peeps!  Earlier this week we've swatted the Servitor twice and that Praetorian fella again Benny Hill style, and picked up a <b>Lurid Dagger for Galkoratikalamp, Sombrous Claidmore's for Arthurr and Humil, Wand of Musing for Dhelia and a Divine Hammer for Arthurr</b>.

<p align="left">We've been around a bit these last few weeks, killed this and that, the usual lark.  First up, we had a return trip to Plane of Air:
</p>
  <center><img src="po1.jpg"></center>   
  <p align="left">
Its always good to see lots of paladins taking Deathtouches, ahhh!  We romped across PoA for a bit and completed Doneb and Tilamven's Epics, grats guys!  Got a few other notable drops including a Necro Epic cloak, a Fruity Warbow and a whole assortment of the usual common quest gaff.  Next however, Grieg's End... very odd zone, where you and ya mates are all turned into various creatures, and even women:
<p>
<center><img src="po3.jpg"></center>
<p align="left">
Thanks Doneb for sending me that SS - least it wasn't an ogre! /shudder.  Reet, so after romping about in here for a while, we track down our little fun for the evening, Praetorian Myral, the DA Hammer guy - and Hrrask had a perfect way to sum up the strat for it...
<p>
<center><img src="po2.jpg"><br><img src="po4.jpg"></center>
<p align="left">
So after chasing me around the room for a bit he finally fell over dead - interesting little fight, something a bit different.  So grats Notrik on the daft hammer... Now then, dwagons!
<p>
<center><img src="po6.jpg"><img src="po7.jpg"></center>
<p>
Didn't have any pictures handy, as once a bloody-gain Trakanon banished me to the shrooms so I had to /disc gate, and Zlandicar... well I forgot to patch, so he was just a Hella big human haha.  However, grats people on Trak teeth, Zindras and Sarthok on Cowls, Cyrienne on ST Key, Drith on Zland Heart and the surprise drop of the evening, Galko on a new Sapper.  We also dropped Velkator earlier on somewhere for some boots for Darkivy and gloves for Drith too.  But the star of the show was Mega:
<p><center><img src="po5.jpg"></center>
<p align="left">
After charging Zlandicar and hitting auto, he had time to run down stairs answer the door, pay the pizza man and get back and eat a slice before Zland fell over dead - pure class!  Have fun bitches, time to get back to the AAs!

TSW attempted its first Ring War this evening, and the results were quite in our favour indeed.  For a first run at this quest we were successful in sending Narandi 6 feet under, and keeping alive all the hero's!  Grats TSW for that, and of course Aflac on ubbah ring!  And also, thanks for the cooperation with those in GD who had their plans for the day kinda turned over ;)
<p align="left">
And on a side note, grats to Notrik on Lance of Narandi, Celebril on Choker of the Wretched, Zigzager on Faceguard of Bentos the Hero, Conjurous on Eye of Narandi, Cinga on Earring of the Frozen Skull and meh on Crown of Narandi.  We'll be back for more shortly, count on that.  Stay frosty bitches!

We've reopened recruiting in a small way for a few more dedicated players who can raid during GMT prime-time.  See the App section for more information.
<p align="left">
So what we been up to eh?  We've downed Doomshade a few more times, knocked off Velkator, farmed HoT a lil more and killed Goreniare, as well as an assortment of other minor kills.  Apart from that, we've been kicking back and grinding a little xp, a lot of people have gained various AA titles, and few have yet more reaching the end of the road at lvl60, grats to all!  Loot of note in the past few weeks would be: DW on FT2 Arms, Humil on Shadowheart, Ephron on Sword of Freedom, Conjurous on Boots of Bladecalling, and bank on all sorts of other assorted rubbish.
