 We will continue to strive not only to be a close-knit guild but also endeavor to earn the respect of those outside our guild and keep our reputation in high standing. There are certain guidelines any member already a part of Remnants of the circle or those considering joining should keep in mind:<br><br>
 
 The most important aspect of our guild is to have fun and interact with each other and on each others' behalves for the betterment of each individual as well as the guild as a whole. <br><br>
 Although some guilds will let all who apply in and other guilds require lengthy quests to be completed before entry into the guild, we are less formal but not without our standards. We are a network of friends. In order to become a part of Remnants of the Circle, one must be recommended into the guild. The best way for that to happen is to make a friend and be a friend by grouping with us, chatting with us, writing on our message board.
 <br><br>
 Our guild is a small, but growing one. I believe I can safely say that all those in our guild truly love it and consider it to be one of the best, most family-like guild in EQ. Let's all keep it that way by continuing to successfully add more outstanding individuals to make up our whole!
 <br><br>
 We look for certain personality types. Some of the traits we look for are an easygoing personality that will not only tolerate joking, teasing, and a playful atmosphere, but will relish and join in the fun.
 <br><br>
 There is a difference between asking for a hand and asking for a hand out. This guild on the whole detests beggars and those who disrespect the time and energy it takes to help others.
 <br><br>
 Be sure to be respectful to those around us. Please and Thank You go a long way.
 <br><br>
 Our members are quick to help each other out, but because of everyone's willingness to help, there are those who may consider joining us for ulterior motives. Obviously we will be capable of identifying those individuals in a timely fashion as they are not a character type we seek or like and therefore believe we don't need to introduce a probation period for new members.
 <br><br>
