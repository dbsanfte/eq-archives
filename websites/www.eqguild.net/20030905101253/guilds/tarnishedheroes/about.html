             <td width="93%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tarnished Heroes originally 
               started with the birth of an elven ranger named Duilin. Duilin, 
               being a true crack dealer at heart, decided to call on all his friends 
               to drop by and play for a month, just to see how they liked it. 
               Like the sheep that we were, we followed&#133;<br>
               <br>
               &amp;^$@%^ you Duilin gahhhhhhhhhh<br>
               <br>
               ahem now, if I may continue our tale&#133;<br>
               <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a close circle of RL friends, baptized 
               in the fires of RPG's and forged in the anvils of text-based MUDs. 
               We choose Vazaelle because it had the lowest number of players on 
               it when Duilin first logged in. We chose to form a guild because 
               it was too hard to manage 12 /tell conversations at a time. We choose 
               Tarnished Heroes as a name because all the good ones were taken, 
               no one would agree to Prairie Dogs of War, and all the other names 
               we thought were cool and non-n00bish would never fit over our character's 
               heads. So, on Thursday, October 4 th, 2001, Tarnished Heroes graced 
               the Vaezelle server with our presence.<br>
               <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, we wanted to keep our guild 
               just to ourselves, but gradually we realized having extras people 
               in the guild would be beneficial. So, after a few months, we started 
               talking about recruiting. We've recruited a few, and we're looking 
               for for brave souls.<br>
               <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many players, we started out thinking 
               that we would never play for longer than a month or so before we 
               got bored. We still play. We thought we'd never make it to the first 
               hell level. We're now going through our 4th and 5th hell levels. 
               We thought we'd never have to worry about epics or expansions. We 
               never thought we'd actually say &quot;phat lewt&quot; in real life. 
               Damn you all to hell crack dealers, j00 will pay.<br>
               <br>
               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any case we are here now. And hopefully 
               making a good name for ourselves. We're not just heroes, we're tarnished 
               ones too.</td>

               Both guilds were planning to join this Alliance, I believe along
