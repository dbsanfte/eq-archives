<font size=4><b>Rules of the Raid:</b></font>
<P>
<font size="+1">
<ul>
<li>Listen and follow the directions of the <b>Raid Leader</b>.  The <b>Raid Leader</b> has absolute say on a raid. 
<br>
You will follow his/her instructions to the letter.  You will not argue with the <b>Raid Leader</b>.
<br>
The <b>Raid Leader</b> can change any aspect of the Raid if they deem it necessary. If in their infinite wisdom the <b>Raid Leader</b> chooses to assign an item rather then having it open to random they may do so.  Generally such conditions will be made known prior to the raid starting.
<br>
If you do not do as you are told by the <b>Raid Leader</b> you will be removed from the Raid.</b>
<li>Items will be randomed among those that have <b>need</b> first.  <b>Need</b> for an item is defined as an item that you do not have, is better then what you do have, and you will put that item on when you receive it.  Useing an item for an alt or for trade/selling does not qualify as <b>need</b>.</li>
<li>Items that no one has <b>need</b> for will be randomed among all that are attending.  The exception to this is if the item is no-drop, in which case the item will only be randomed among those that can use it.</li>
<li>Items that cannot be used and would otherwise rot, will be destroid.</li>
<li>Once you have received an item you may not get another item until everyone else has.  The exception to this would be if an item would rot if not assigned to you.</li>
<li>If the purpose of the Raid is to get a specific person an item they will not be be able to get other loot unless it would rot.</li>
<li>Participants that come late to a raid may be required to wait an hour before they will be allowed to roll on items.</li>
<br><br>
<b>Other Loot:</b>
<br><br>
<li><u>Precious Gems</u>: Diamonds, Blue Diamonds and so on may be held for the Guild or may be randomed among the participants. The <b>Raid Leader</b> will make this determination.</li>
<li><u>Un-expected quest items</u>: These items will be assigned or disposed of by the <b>Raid Leader</b>.
<li><u>General loot</u>: Pp, non-precious gems, items sold only for pp will be given to the guild to cover raid costs.  The <b>Raid Leader</b> will if needed distribute this to participants in the raid that have spent personal items or money to assist the Raid.</li>
<li><u>Spell drops</u>:  Spell drops are the property of the Guild.  The <b>Raid Leader</b> has the authority to assign spells to participants.  If a spell is assigned it does not affect that persons ability to random on items.</li>
<li><u>Trash</u>: Any general item will be considered trash and can be disposed of as needed.</li>
<li><u>Cost of the Raid</u>:  The Guild will cover all costs for the Raid.  If you purchase items for the raid the Guild will reimburse you.</li>
</ul>
