               energy it takes to help others. </font></p>
             <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">--Be sure to be respectful 
               to those around us. Please and Thank You go a long way. If one feels 
               the need to ask for help, and the person you're requesting help 
               from appears to be busy doing other things or expresses the desire 
               not to help for whatever reason, thank them for their time and then 
               find your own way. DO NOT pester someone who has already told you 
               they can't help for whatever reason. </font></p>

               Therefore, all new members will be in a probation period for two 
               weeks. During that time, it will give us all a chance to see if

                 or external EQ forms of communication like e-mail and message 
                 boards. Remember that you show off that guild tag wherever you 
                 go in Norrath! No Wolf Den member shall use foul, belligerent 
                 or disrespectful language in guild chat. Profanity and name-calling 
                 will not be tolerated. This falls under the Everquest Rules Of 
                 Conduct. See Below Sections #1 and 1.1.4 of the Code.</li>

                 use the &quot;Role-playing&quot; switch (/roleplay). This is punishable 
                 by deletion from the guild as it shows that you do not have any 
                 pride in your guild.</li>
               <li>All members will refrain from begging. This is acceptable for 
                 the NPC's and Mob's, it is not acceptable to the Guild as it is

               <li>No Wolf Den member shall purposely kill steal or train any individual,

               <li>Wolf Den currently recruits all classes and all races. In addition, 
                 any of your alternate characters can be recruited, regardless 
                 of level, once you have a primary character in the guild. Keep 
                 a look out for other recruits even if you are not an officer - 
                 if you think they are valuable, then most likely the guild will 
                 feel the same way. Do not recruit from other guilds. NO toon(s)

               <li>If you ask for a rez and receive multiple responses, please 
                 be polite when you answer them. Chances are is that they are there 
                 fighting or working themselves and have to take the attention 
                 away from their group in order to respond. If they are willing 
                 to come to you and you begin to give directions to that cleric, 
                 please note that it is very rude to tell them when they are on 
                 the way, that you found someone else who has a better rezzing 
                 ability. This is not fair to either of the clerics, their groups, 
                 the involved guilds, and yourself. If another cleric shows up 
                 as a result of someone else in your party requesting a cleric 
                 that you had no knowledge of, please donate to the cleric you 
                 were dealing with, after all they did come to rez you at your 
                 request. This is not only fair, but it doesn't look bad to the 
                 rescuing cleric and they will remember this bit of kindness.</li>
               <li>Members are to adhere to the rules set forth here. If there

                 this may sound harsh, it is for the good of the guild.</li>

               the player can determine what activities are appropriate: </p>
             <p><br>
               <font color="#FF0000"><b>1.</b></font> <b><font color="#000000">You 
               may not steal kills.</font></b><br>
               Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason 
               that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without 
               that group's specific permission.<br>
               The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual 
               Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together 
               or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest 
               Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy. </p>

               Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen 
               creature without the express permission of those who killed the 
               creature if they are in attendance.<br>
               The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures 
               that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to 
               it being looted by the rightful owner.</p>

               There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing. 
               In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. If an equitable 
               compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest 
               Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a binding 
               compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by an EQCSR 
               will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested 
               that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they 
               can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise 
               that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise 
               would.<br>
               Note: A "group" in this case is defined as a party of one or more

               swear words, real-world racial slurs, and other language that is

               Harassment is defined as specifically targeting another player or 
               group of players to harm or inconvenience them. Harassment can take 
               many forms, as it goes to the state-of-mind of the person or party 
               on the receiving end of the action. However, in order to account 
               for those who are excessively thin-skinned, the EQCSR involved will 
               make a determination as to whether or not the average person would 
               feel "harassed" and act accordingly.</p>

               monopolizing numerous spawn areas with the intent to exclude other

               Though some of these actions are covered in part by other rules, 
               they deserve their own note here. The following things would be

               Though EverQuest is a Role-playing game, the claim of "Role-play" 
               will not be accepted in defense of any of the anti-social behaviors 
               mentioned above. As an example, you are in no case (PvP or otherwise) 
               allowed to "Train" a guard onto an enemy in protection of your homeland. 
               In another example, a rogue is not allowed to steal someone's corpse 
               under the guise of role-playing a thief.<br>
               By all means we want to encourage you to play your role, we just

               <font color="#FF0000"><b>1.2 </b></font><b>Special Rules Regarding 
               PvP Servers </b><br>
               The PvP Servers are a special case for many of the policies listed 
               here. When one makes the decision to play on a PvP Server, they 
               are in essence agreeing to play on a server where compromise is 
               decided on the basis of who has the power to kill whom.<br>
               By the same token, we expect that the people on those servers will 
               apply PvP combat in all situations where it is called for, as a 
               resolution to the problem. As such, the EverQuest Customer Service 
               Staff will decline to intervene in cases where a PvP alternative 
               exists, such as at disputed spawns where the parties involved have 
               the ability to attack each other.<br>
               Though the PvP environment does eliminate a few of the problems 
               experienced on the normal servers, there are a few more PvP-specific 
               problems that are created.</p>
             <p><br>
               <font color="#FF0000"><b><font color="#000000">Causing Experience 
               Loss</font></b></font><br>
               Intentionally causing experience-loss to other players in the PvP 
               environment is illegal in all cases and will result in a warning 
               when witnessed by an EQCSR. This includes things such as intentionally 
               training NPCs, and purposefully allowing an NPC to get the final 
               blow in combat. We do understand that there are cases where the 
               experience-loss is unintentional, and will take no action unless 
               a person earns a reputation of causing unintentional experience-loss.<br>
               Much like how the Kill Stealing rule applies to those on the blue 
               servers, this rule is designed to discourage and make note of those 
               who do it habitually, thus betraying the spirit of PvP. As a note, 
               the EQCSR will not in any case provide a resurrection for someone 
               who was caused experience loss in PvP, intentionally or otherwise. 
               This is one of the dangers of playing on a PvP server.</p>
