               Raiding with AoU</i></b></font></p>
             <p></p>
             <p>Raids are about our guild coming together to accomplish what we 
               can not accomplish alone. A raid typically involves 2 or more groups. 
               To be successful, we all must work together. The guide was created 
               to set your expectations on what you will get out of a raid and, 
               most inportantly, what is expected of you. Take the time to read 
               all of this guide.</p>
             <p>So, what should you expect on a raid? In general,</p>
             <p></p>
             <ul>
               <li>Expect to commit numerous hours during the raid (typically 4+ 
                 hours) </li>
               <li>Expect that someone will get experience, probably not you.</li>
               <li>Expect that someone will get loot, probably not you.</li>
               <li>Expect that someone will die, probably you.</li>
             </ul>
           <hr></td>
         </tr>
         <tr> 
           <td valign="top" align="top" width="44%" > <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Preparations 
             before the raid</i></b></font> 
             <ul>
               <li> Make level, class and resist requirements for a raid. For example 
                 100 unbuffed MR/CR and level 48+ for a Vox raid. You can make 
                 exceptions for some people due to being short on certain classes. 
                 You can also make exceptions for Gnomes of course! 
               <li> Do not take too many people with you, if you have enough of 
                 one class dont be afraid to say no. Strive for class balance, 
                 zergling rushes might work in Starcraft but are no fun and take 
                 way too long to organise (buffs, ports, loot) in EQ. For some 
                 people making as many corpses as they can has become a form of 
                 art. 
               <li>Make sure everyone is on time for the raid and you are not missing 
                 key classes. The raid should have been announced on the guild 
                 messageboard, the guild calendar, the guild motd and in guildspeak 
                 so we have plenty of chances to be reminded when it is. Also make 
                 sure you are on time for work the next day! 
               <li>Research the zone and the mob you are raiding very well. Some 
                 mobs can only be cast on from melee range, have immunities to 
                 fire/cold, can complete heal, gate and such. Let people know this 
                 so they can prepare and memorize the right spells. Refer to the 
                 <a href="http://www.dith.demon.co.uk/slows/">slow table</a>. You 
                 want to know every weakness and ability of the mob and every corner 
                 of the zone, so people can ask you questions on what color socks 
                 your dragon is wearing today. 
               <li> Buy your components beforehand and take your resist gear from 
                 the bank beforehand. Dont forget your gnome kebob of course, cant 
                 work on an empty stomach! 
               <li> Have your settings the right way. If performance is a problem 
                 put your particle effects off, 3d sky off, dynamic lights off, 
                 luclin models off, data rate correctly and serverside filtering 
                 on and so on, umbra on for indoor luclin zones and off otherwise 
                 (should be automatic). For some people like main tanks and their 
                 clerics however, serverside filtering should be off so healing 
                 wont be too late because of lag. Maybe Moore's law will some day 
                 catch up with EQ expansion requirements and all this tweaking 
                 wont be needed anymore. 
               <li> Put all or most of your 'battle spam' options off if possible, 
                 like others hits, your misses, peoples spellcasting and so on. 
                 You need to see the orders you have to follow. Noticing that the 
                 average hit of gnome warriors is 5 more then trolls is useless. 
                 Because you couldnt read your orders 'Back off!' a mob got pushed 
                 off a cliff... with you going after it when it starts to summon. 
                 Wheee! 
               <li> Prepare all your hotkeys beforehand (for most people this should 
                 be an /assist main_assist_name key). You can also accomplish this 
                 though clicking on the mob (F8) then assisting it to see who is 
                 highest on the aggro list, this way your heal is often too late 
                 though. It is rumored some top secret tactics involve /assist 
                 on the mob then pressing resurrect. 
               <li>Have a -good- Corpse recovery (CR) plan. On a CR people can 
                 get irritated quickly. And if people leave, the CR becomes even 
                 harder. You dont want to have any xp res timers expire. Have rogues 
                 and monks ready, CoH mages, corpse summoners with enough coffins 
                 and an essence emerald, people with extra weapons in the bank, 
                 extra hate stones, whatever it takes. As long as you have a good 
                 plan it will cut down a lot on possible extended frustration. 
                 And you may be able to convince people to try the mob again... 
                 and again...

               buffing</i></b></font> </p>
             <ul>
               <li>Be patient when making groups and getting people ports, this 
                 is a nasty part of being raid leader. People should be familiar 
                 with what kind of balanced groups to form and who the porters 
                 are. Of course its not a bad habit to express your gratitude to 
                 the porters. If none are available, buy a port from out of guild 
                 or use the Luclin spires. Even though people have been said to 
                 disappear when using out of guild ports, it might be the safest 
                 way of getting yourself to meet with a gigantic agressive carnivorous 
                 dragon. 
               <li> Dont mess around when gathering for a raid (pking each other) 
                 come to a druid/wizard ring as soon as you can and gather in a 
                 remote place (depending on the raid, but NOT gfay, Karnors or 
                 FV or so) and be patient. Don't fall asleep at your keyboard when 
                 buffing or making the groups though. 
               <li> The group leader is responsible for buffing, not the raid leader. 
                 Also makes sure the group buffs itself with enough crap buffs 
                 (when fighting mobs which can dispel). Each group gathers in a 
                 different spot so it can be easily seen where each group is. Sadly 
                 theres always people who insist any buff that costs a peridot 
                 is crappy. 
               <li> Dont ask for unnecessary buffs. Don't go playing or running 
                 around during buffing, just be patient and wait in your spot. 
                 Unless that dragon pops on your head again of course. 
               <li> Do not ask questions to the raid leader, ask them to your group 
                 or in /say, the group leaders should be well informed. Dont hesitate 
                 to ask questions either if you think they are important (but dont 
                 do it in tells to the raid leader) or if it is your first raid. 
                 Of course those questions should be related to Everquest. 
               <li> Listen to every word your raid leader shouts (or sometimes 
                 OOC). Raid leader and main debuffers (slowers, mezzers etc.) use 
                 shout, and noone else. Do as you are told as quick as you can 
                 (especially when moving). Do not bug the raid leader with tells. 
                 Dont drink alcoholic beverages when you are the raid leader, this 
                 goes for in-game drinks only of course. 
             </ul>
             <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Lewt!</i></b></font></p>
             <ul>
               <li>Raids cost pp. We will have expenses like coffins (necro), peridots 
                 (enchanter, wizard and cleric) and pearls (mage, cleric). Sometimes 
                 the first few money loot items in a raid go to the people who 
                 make these expenses. Group leaders make sure every item goes to 
                 the ninja looter... erm I mean to the raid leader. 
               <li>Make sure loot rules are clear beforehand. Do some research 
                 on what can drop and who can and will use it. In our guild, our 
                 officers will decide on loot. People who get an item hand their 
                 old equipment into the guild. This equipment will then be handed 
                 down the ranks. AoU equips their main classes (tanks, clerics, 
                 chanters, etc) with the best drops first. This makes the guild 
                 as a whole stronger. We will make sure other people get something 
                 too once in a while.
               <li>If rolling on something, we will let people who would use it 
                 send a tell. Who gets the loot is based upon level, class, existing 
                 gear, and your involvement with the guild.
               <li>Do not ask for pulls of specific mobs or loot. Do not expect 
                 loot, you might get something nice, but probably not. Be glad 
                 someone got something, people will remember that you helped them 
                 out, and will return that favor in kind. Try to be nice to people 
                 who give you a whack on the head. 
             </ul>

           <td valign="top" align="top" width="44%" > 
             <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>During the raid</i></b></font></p>
             <ul>
               <li> ALWAYS use assist, and have attack on assist off. If the main 
                 tank calls for a switch DO SO as fast as you can. Someone should 
                 root the former target. Sometimes it is good to have several extra 
                 tanks designated beforehand to holding off unmezzable adds with 
                 root/slow/heal tank. Not attacking can save more people then attacking 
                 the wrong mob. 
               <li> Only the main tank (main assist or MA) ever breaks a mez. The 
                 main assist will announce very clearly what the main target is. 
                 Everyone else has a button that says /assist name_of_MA (you can 
                 check if the mob is taunted enough by /assisting the mob and seeing 
                 if he targets himself). Everyone should have the 'attack on assist' 
                 option off, and wait attacking till after the MA has done so. 
                 Sometimes the MA needs to be on a mob 10 seconds longer then the 
                 rest of the raid to establish aggro. If you have too many enchanters 
                 on a raid it might be fun to break some mezzes if the raid gets 
                 too boring. Make sure your healer is paying attention! 
               <li> Root and stun mobs that are not mezzed and can be, try to slow 
                 them if possible and put a tank in front of it... but do NO damage 
                 to it so they wont summon. Do not use grasping roots but the non 
                 damaging wizard, enchanter, shaman, cheric, paladin or necromancer 
                 versions of the spell like root, enstill, fetter. Do not use sound 
                 of force but stun, do not hit the mob but only taunt. One of the 
                 best kiters is the enchanter who has zillions of spells made just 
                 to piss off mobs. 
               <li> In general do not use dots in raids on regular mobs. Sometimes 
                 people need to switch targets mid fight, when you use a dot this 
                 means the enchanter dies which often means the raid fails. Also 
                 these mobs die far to quick for these spells to be effective. 
                 Of course the necro dot that can turn a mob into a skeleton might 
                 get your tanks appreciation. 
               <li> Only mages (and necros) should have pets since there is a maximum 
                 number of pets that can be on a mob at once. Make sure pet taunt 
                 is off. Let your pet attack when the main tank has enough aggro 
                 /assist the main tank. Be aware of buggy pathing and place your 
                 pet accordingly. If a mob has an AE fire breath mages make fire 
                 pets since it will be immune to the AE. Make sure pets wont train 
                 mobs because of an AE (get the pet control skill). A novel way 
                 of pulling in Temple of Veeshan employs enchanter pets. 
               <li> Do not push mobs on to walls, into water or off ledges, pull 
                 back if you see that is going to happen. Mind pets here too. If 
                 you see a mob nearing something, everyone should stand between 
                 the mob and that obstacle so the mob gets knocked away from it. 
                 If that is not possible everyone should disengage and pull back, 
                 on a summoning mob this is a little harder but still works because 
                 it only summons each 12 seconds. Fighting things in water is not 
                 a good thing if you never learnt to swim, neither is pushing Vox 
                 on a wall so the melees cant hit her without their inflatable 
                 gnomish mountaineering kits. Mobs that poof and port when pushed 
                 in a wall, then summon people from the other end of the dungeon 
                 and kill them one by one might be a faster way of teleportation 
                 then conventional means though. 
               <li> When low on healers, druids and such save mana for heals and 
                 do not nuke. When getting really low on healers, druids and such 
                 save mana for ports. 
               <li> Dont be afraid to use your special abilities like lay on hands 
                 to save main tanks, clerics or enchanters in dangerous situations. 
                 You have that ability for a reason, now is the time to use it. 
                 By saving the cleric or chanter or main tank you might save the 
                 entire raid. Remember not to have the mob targeted when using 
                 LoH. 
               <li> Do not sit when people have an incoming pull, the mob will 
                 aggro on you. Stand up as soon as people say inc %t. Sometimes 
                 a melee group can pull a mob onto them by sitting, so the caster 
                 groups can stand in the back. Dont sit either after casting a 
                 high aggro spell like tashanian or slow. Although it has become 
                 a sport amongst enchanters to see how fast they can die. 
               <li> Do not wander away from the group, stick together or you may 
                 aggro additional mobs. Raids are not a time for exploring zones, 
                 do that when on your own or when playing someone elses char. 
               <li> When you get aggroed, invis drops or whatever, die away from 
                 the raid force, you can be dragged or summoned and ressed, a new 
                 break in because of total wipe out is only fun for the mobs. Of 
                 course that halfling pain sound is hilarious, so dont hesitate 
                 to train any furryfeet. 
               <li>Do not go AFK in nasty places, only in the designated rest spots. 
                 Dont swim in a warm pool of water if a resting spot is nearby. 
               <li>And of course everyone makes a mistake once in a while, just 
                 admit those and learn from them, dont get mad at eachother. Unless 
                 they take your lewts of course.

             <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>Advanced raid tactics</i></b></font></p>
             <ul>
               <li> When fighting a dragon or other monster with an AE, melee groups 
                 should consist of 4 (or 5) tanks and 1 or 2 group heal classes. 
                 Clerics and paladins will use group heals to counter the AE weapon 
                 from these mobs. Also make sure your HP regen is maxed out by 
                 stacking druid and bard regen. Use an instant cast item if the 
                 AE has a dispel component. Jboots wont work indoors so get at 
                 least a gnomish tinkered telescope. 
               <li>With indoor AE'ing mobs, casters hide behind a wall. One melee 
                 should be designated to call out the AE. As soon as he or she 
                 shouts the casters come out of hiding and cast, then go behind 
                 the wall again. Behind the wall refresh your wizard epic or runes 
                 and wait for the next call. 
               <li>Some fights against an AE'ing mob are done in 'waves'. For example 
                 in a Trakanon raid, you send in one person to trigger the first 
                 AE. Then the tank group(s) will run in. Just after the next AE 
                 send in the rest of the groups (casters to finish off the mob). 
                 This way you avoid having the entire raid force subject to the 
                 AE weapon of the mob when aggro is not established yet. 
               <li>It is a good tactic to interrupt some high level caster mobs 
                 by having all tanks (sometimes even rogues) on one side and bash/kick, 
                 so they push the mob to the one direction. In addition you want 
                 to mana sieve as well as cast Torment of Argli on the mob. This 
                 will prevent gates and cheals if done right. 
               <li>Mobs should be hit by recant magic, malo (or mala), tashanian, 
                 occlusion of sound (55+ bard) then malosini, slow and other debuffs. 
                 The bard who sings Occlusion uses puretone, a percussion instrument 
                 like drums of the beast or his epic, otherwise the song will not 
                 work. Mobs should also be snared, sundered etc. if possible. Shout 
                 %t has been pillaged, tashed, malo'ed, slowed, snared if it sticks 
                 (make a hot key for this). Let everyone who can slow cast it, 
                 the best slow overwrites other ones anyways (and the difference 
                 of shaman and enchanter slow is small). Refer to the <a href="http://www.dith.demon.co.uk/slows/">slow 
                 chart</a>. 
               <li>If a mob flurries, rampages or has nasty procs do not forget 
                 to cripple it. These skills or procs are based on the AGI of the 
                 mob and cripple decreases that by 65. 
               <li>Some fights require 3 or more clerics to stagger casts of Complete 
                 Heal 5 or maybe even 3 seconds apart from eachother on the main 
                 tank, with additional people healing in the meanwhile. Make sure 
                 your complete heal spells are mapped to the guild/ooc/shout channel, 
                 and make sure each cleric knows the healing order. The main tank 
                 or main assist (MA) is a warrior with defensive discipline on. 
               <li>Defensive only lasts 3 minutes so sometimes multiple 55+ warriors 
                 are needed who will take turns tanking. In these fights aggro 
                 is often proximity based. Make sure to control aggro and aggro 
                 switches well, if such a mob ping-pongs you are all dead. Other 
                 healing classes will patch-heal in case a cheal comes too late 
                 (continually cast heals and duck them out at the last moment if 
                 its not needed). 
               <li>Some mobs need 2 main tanks instead of 1. These mobs have abilities 
                 which can knock your MA away from the fight for example by porting, 
                 banishing or knocking them back. Also some mobs rampage often, 
                 and since you dont want your clerics to be killed in rampages 
                 a defensive tank should take these hits. 
               <li>Make sure you know how the aggro rules work. In Velious for 
                 example mobs will kill people below a certain amount of health 
                 (roughly below 2 bubs) regardless of who is highest on the hate 
                 list. What this means is for example if you are fighting a dragon 
                 their AE will wear you down, if people (for example casters) have 
                 low health from this the dragon will switch and melee them to 
                 death instead of the MA. It might be hard to regain the correct 
                 aggro then. So hide behind a wall and yell for a heal if you are 
                 ever at 2 bubs or lower. 
               <li>Some mobs have 2 pets (which can be level 58+ creatures themselves) 
                 which need to be split during the fight. There are many ways to 
                 accomplish this. With Derakor the Vindicator for example you can 
                 kite either him or his pets while your raid force kills the other. 
                 Or you can use 2 monks working together, or make use of speed 
                 differences in the pets and its master. Or just tank them. Many 
                 ways that accomplish the same thing, do whichever you feel most 
                 comfortable with. 
               <li>Sometimes unconventional ways of pulling are required, some 
                 mobs require pulling that involves warping (pathing in this game 
                 is not exactly perfect and it is apparrently the only way to do 
                 it). Try out some stuff with combinations of spells, pets or FD. 
               <li>Don't be afraid to try out new things to test something. You 
                 can learn more on one failed raid, where you try out different 
                 things to see what works best in practise, then on all succesful 
                 raids together.

             <p>Note: This section might sound a bit harsh but these rules are 
               absolutely necessary and must be followed. </p>
             <p> <b>1 - STFU</b> 
             <p> No one cares what you have to say. I don't want to hear you /shout 
               "all your loot are belong to me", because I will call lights to 
               kill you, and I’ll pay them to do it. 
             <p> No one cares what you have to say at this point. you need to keep 
               your yap shut. 
             <p> This includes, but is not limited to your uber bullshit speak 
               about how you will "own" this raid, your auction of some bullshit 
               item that no one at this level would dare equip, much less be seen 
               still carrying, or your damn inability to stop using the /shout 
               channel to talk smack to some idiot who wants to babble as much 
               as you do. 
             <p> <b>2 - Speak when you are spoken to</b> 
             <p> We have been calling raid information for 20 minutes, groups are 
               all formed, buffs are starting to be issued, and you now have no 
               group. 
             <p> If you would have shut up to begin with, you would have seen your 
               group assignment. If you had kept your trap shut and read, you would 
               know what chat room to log to. If you would have crammed a sock 
               in the hole you spew garbage out of, you would know what you are 
               supposed to do. 
             <p> How many times does the raid leader have to ask you not to use 
               /shout? When are you going to STFU and listen? 
             <p> Never? 
             <p> Bad dog, we don’t like that. No CoF for you. 
             <p> You do as you are told on a raid. That is why you are there. You 
               are not leading the raid, you are there to do what you are told 
               by the raid leaders. If you are told to send a tell to RaidLeader01, 
               you send him a tell with the information he has asked for. You do 
               this promptly, and you don't spam him with useless blabber. We don't 
               care about any information right now except what we have asked for, 
               and emergencies that pop up. 
             <p> Some people have to be told the same things over and over again 
               at every raid and continue to do the same stupid things every time 
               after being told not too. 
             <p> Too stupid to listen? STFU. Go away now. You are not needed here. 
             <p> <b>3 - Your opinion on loot rules and random rolls</b> 
             <p> We don't care what it is. We don't care whether or not you like 
               it. We don't care how much you whine. 
             <p> Leave now, go away. You are not needed here. 
             <p> You are an -insert class here- and an item dropped you can use? 
               Great. I don't want to hear it. Remember the rule about STFU? It's 
               still in force. Remember where I asked what class and level you 
               are to form the groups? Guess what this means? 
             <p> I already know you are here. I know who can use what item. Stop 
               spamming me with tells. I don’t care what you have to say about 
               what you can use. 
             <p> No, you won't random. I will do that for you, and I'll let you 
               know who won. Don't like it? Leave, you are not needed anymore. 
               Don't know your way back out of the zone? Not my problem, you should 
               not have been yapping your mouth like an ass. 
             <p> <b>4 - Ninja POS</b> 
             <p> Ok great ninja looter, guess what? GM's can tell us who looted 
               that mith mask. All your group members get a message when you loot 
               an item. Everyone around you has already done a /guildstatus to 
               see what guild you are in if you don't have a tag up. 
             <p> Import of this? We know who you are. We will INSURE you are miserable 
               and have to recreate a new character if you ninja loot an item. 
             <p> <b>5 - The things you do</b> 
             <p> Everything you do represents not only you, but your guild. If 
               you are a total fuckin moron, other people will think the same of 
               our guild. If you ninja items, we will be removed from the guild.
             <p> And if you are a buffer and you don't know what the hell you are 
               doing, let the raid leader know and he will assign someone to let 
               you know what to do. 
             <p> Is this your first raid? 
             <p> Then you don't know what the hell you are doing, so ask. Don't 
               just stand there and look retarded when someone is saying "BUFF 
               ME YOU STUPID FUK!" because their buffs are wearing off since it 
               took you 45 minutes to ask everyone else in your party what you 
               are supposed to do and you still dont get it. 
             <p> If you don't know what you are doing, be honest enough to admit 
               it and someone else will do your job. This is the way we end up 
               with Cleric buffs at the top fighting a mob that AE dispells 
             <p> Know what? You will NOT be disrespected if you admit you are confused 
               by the whole scene. Those that have been on a number of runs remember 
               that their first one was a blur. Have the balls to admit that you 
               are having a tough time, and you will be both looked after and taken 
               care of. 
             <p> Don't like it? STFU. Go away. You are not needed here. 
             <p> <b>6 - PAY ATTENTION</b> 
             <p> Don't sit there AFK for 45 damn minutes and then bitch that you 
               are clueless. Go away now, you are useless. 
             <p> Don't log your damn 4th account on, and be clueless about what 
               is happening. This is all your fault if you die and get me dead 
               as well. 
             <p> (Notice I did not say /shout? Remember what this is for? You don't? 
               Leave, you are useless.) 
             <p> <b>7 - My time and your time</b> 
             <p> My time is valuable, do you have respect for that? No? Leave, 
               you are useless. Have the decency to respect the time and effort 
               that is required to plan and execute a large scale rade. 
             <p> Don't start in /ooc 10 minutes into getting the raid organized 
               you are bored. It takes some god damn time to get everyone in the 
               proper group with the proper buffs. 
             <p> If you don't have a fucking half hour to spend sitting around 
               waiting for everything to get organized get your ass back to OT 
               and continue soloing. 
             <p> Another thing for you. Raids are designed to do things as a group, 
               not to cater to your own version of how life should be in EQ. Guess 
               what? If you complain that there isn't any decent loot or good exp 
               in what we are doing, your ass won't be invited back for the next 
               event which may involve getting the loot you need. 
             <p> Have a bad attitude? See that cool screenshot of the A_Uber_Weapon_01 
               you want? Print a copy and tack it to your forehead cause that is 
               as close you are gonna get to seein it in. 
             <p> <b>8 - Your opinions after the raid</b> 
             <p> This is when your raid leaders turn back into regular human beings. 
               This is when you send them a tell and let them know any comments 
               you have. This is when you get a response to your concerns. This 
               is when we have common courtesy and hear you out. 
             <p> Do it during the raid? STFU. Leave. You are not needed here. 
             <p> <b>-Recap-</b> 
             <ul>
               <li>Keep your mouth shut 
               <li>Do as you are told 
               <li>Don't use /shout, your raid leaders use this 
               <li>Listen closely 
               <li>Don't use /shout, your raid leaders use this 
               <li>Don't train and get us all killed 
               <li>Pay attention to /shout, your raid leaders use this 
               <li>Don't be a piece of shit ninja looter 
               <li>Don't whine in OOC that you don't understand the loot rules 
               <li>Don't use /shout, your raid leaders use this 
               <li>Don't be an idiot and use SolB, PoF, PoH or PoG as your auction 
                 spot. 
               <li>Don't go AFK for any extended period of time. If you are AFK, 
                 let someone know. 
               <li>Have patience and respect for people who are working hard for
