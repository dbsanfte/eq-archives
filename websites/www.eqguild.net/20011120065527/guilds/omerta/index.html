In a way only Omerta can possibly understand, our plans for Kael were abandoned - something bigger and better turned up: Hate. 
Breaking the Plane of Hate was summed up perfectly by Rinaldi 
<BR>'I knew I was in trouble when I saw my cleric flying through the air like a muppet'.
<BR>Had some really excellent wipeouts and a great atmosphere as the mobs, and ourselves went down.
Congratulation to Rikera on her Wand of Conflagration and Ariasong on a book for her rogue epic.
<BR>Thanks to Laberdere for the invite, Four Elements, Mystic Healers, Socratic Method, Povar-Tarew Artisans and The Well (too many of you to mention) for a really great evening.

Quest day
<BR>After a successful CR from hell we spent a little time questing as a guild. A trip to Mistmoore was successful two-fold, Carneas got some SOW boots for her epic from the Dire Wolf and we repaired some damaged Ring of Scale faction from a previous raid in Burning Woods. We also spent some time in Kaesora obtaining more Zalgoz fangs in preparation for a future trip to Howling Stones before heading for a brief trip to Kael, which yielded some nice loot, including 5 gems for pieces of Velious armour.

A number of Omertians headed to the arena area in Kael Drakkel. In total 3 fairly full groups participated.  We managed to kill about 15 of the arena troopers and veterans before the need for sleep for most people involved cut short our adventures.  No corroded armor drops - but all in all a very strong showing by Omerta and friends.  Not one death drung the raid proper - though running to WL seems more hazardous than actually raiding in Kael. Congratulations to all the helpers on the raid - especially Juliears and Umble, clerics extrordinaire.

Couple of us tagged along to a Laberdere led Nagafen raid. After a lot of waiting, buffing and fretting we were successful in defeating her. Congratulations to Tignous for a book for his epic and to Skarrad on her Cloak of Flames.

Breiz, Korudan and Darkzero represented Omerta as we tried to help Restless Circle kill Ixiblat Fer and the nasty sea dragon Faydedar for a couple of their members' epics.  Ixiblat went down, though his riposte disc took down a lot of the very fast attack speed tanks.  Fay was not quite as easy, and a poor spawn of the dragon into the middle of all the seated casters in the raid spelled trouble - and bad aggro crontrol sealed the issue - with a wipeout and long CR to follow.  Thanks to RC for the invite to help out - was good Ubermob experience for our memebers.

  This has been a busy time with the Halloween events this year running for a number of days. Many people in the guild have been busy in the East Karana and Rathe Mountain events killing new monsters. The <a href="BloodReaver.jpg" target="_blank">Blood Reaver</a> in particular in Rathe Mountains was spectacular. All October news has been archived in the <a href="oldnews.html" target="_self">Old News</a> area.
