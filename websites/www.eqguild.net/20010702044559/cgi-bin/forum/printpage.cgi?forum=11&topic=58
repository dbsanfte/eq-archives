        So sorry i left abruptly last night. As some of u will know ive had pc problems of late and have had to reformat serveral times in the not to distant past. Well lat night while running through ec, it crashed again. <br>My pc is very sick, and has needed instant major surgery. IE new hard drive.  <br>So ill have to miss u all for a couple of days untill everything is reinstalled and i recover as much of it as i can. till then fellow travellers take care.
