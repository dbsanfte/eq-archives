The D'Haran Empire Guild was created based on the "Sword of Truth" series by Terry Goodkind. Throughout its history, this fellowship has enjoyed many seasons of prosperity and suffered long periods of misfortune. <br>

At this time we are rebuilding the Empire under the Leadership of Lornian Rahl with the assistance of her most trusted companion, advisor and friend, Baeaan Rahl. <br>
     <br>
The following guidelines are expected to be known and followed by all members of this guild.
