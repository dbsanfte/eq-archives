           <P></P><FONT color=#cc3134><B>Pre raid</B></FONT><BR>Please be at the 
           meeting place on time or early. There are a substantial number of people 
           who will be late, and if you are on a reserve list and there on time, you 
           might just get one of the late people's spot, if you are on the group 
           list, be early, or at worst, one time. If the raid leader has to fill a 
           lot of empty group slots, it could take up to an hour to work it all out.
           <P>Please be sure to bring the food/water/spell component supplies that 
           you will need. 
           <P>Some of the loot from the raid might be given to a specific person. If 
           this is going to occur, the raid organizer should make that clear before 
           the raid starts, preferably as part of the announcement for the raid.
           <P>Respect your raid personel, they are probably swamped with tells. Ask 
           your group leader your questions first. If they cannot answer you, they 
           can probably refer you to the person that can answer your question. If you 
           have issues with the way things are bring run, please bring them up on the 
           message boards after the raid. If you berate the raid leader during the 
           raid about something you think is unfair, don't be surprised when you are 
           not invited back or asked to leave, even if you were right! If you have 
           immediate concerns, please send a tell to the Raid leader with your 
           concerns in a clam and courteous manner. You will be treated with the same 
           respect or lack thereof as you give out. 
           <P>Summary:<BR>Use your Hot key to assist MA<BR>Wait for MA to shout 
           before engaging<BR>Only MA breaks mes<BR>Keep chatter down on /ooc and 
           don't use /shout<BR>Only Group Leaders check for Loot<BR>Loot goes to the 
           Lootmaster<BR>One loot per customer<BR>If you're disruptive, you will be 
           asked to leave. 
           <P><FONT color=#cc3134><B>The Raid 
           itself</B></FONT><BR>Assisting:<BR>Please insure you know who the main 
           assist (MA) and second assist (SA) are and set up hot keys for both. 
           Please understand that if MA goes down or Link Dead (LD) in a fight, the 
           SA will be promoted to MA and take on all the duties of MA until the 
           original MA comes back. Assuming that Grumm is announced as MA, your 
           hotkey should read something like /assist Grumm or /ass gru if you are 
           lazy like me. Please do not add a comment to your assist hotkey, we don't 
           need to see 36 people spamming us with /ooc assisting Grumm with this %T. 
           We should all be assisting all the time. It should be second nature. 
           <P>Use that assist hotkey:<BR>Do not press f8. Do not target with your 
           mouse. If you need to acquire a target, press your assist hotkey that you 
           made. If you do not use that assist kotkey, you will get yourself killed 
           and probably take an enchanter and shaman with you. 
           <P>There are some exceptions to this rule:<BR>If you are an enchanter or 
           otherwise in a crowd control role on the raid, you may target however you 
           darn well please. If you are in a debuffing role, it is important to get 
           the MA's target debuffed first. After that is accomplished, you can start 
           debuffing any mob that has been successfully Mesmerised (mes) or otherwise 
           stopped. Damage breaks mes. Debuffs do not break mes. If you are in a 
           debuff role on the raid, usually only Shaman and Enchanters, you may 
           target and debuff a mob that has been successfully mesed without using 
           your assist key. If you are not sure you are an exception to the always 
           assist rule, please send a tell to your raid leader or someone he has 
           designated to answer questions. 
           <P>Wait for the MA to shout:<BR>The main assist will be making hotkeys to 
           /shout out their targets, something like /shout smashing %T &gt;&gt;&gt; 
           which when pressed would come out: Grumm shouts 'Smashing &gt;&gt;'. If 
           you are SA, please have your hotkey ready, but don't use it unless the MA 
           goes down. 
           <P>Only MA breaks mes:<BR>If you break mes and you are not MA, you have 
           probably just gotten an enchanter or shaman killed and you are the next on 
           the list. Mes, slows and other debuffs are a huge taunt. The MA will be 
           taunting for 5-15 seconds in an attempt to get to the top of the MOB's 
           hate list before he breaks mes. It is very important that you wait for the 
           MA to shout the target. Once the main assist has shouted his attack, you 
           may unload the firey wrath of heavens on that poor unsuspecting MOB 
           (mobile object, or soon to be dead thing) 
           <P>Sometimes MA will be forced to change targets:<BR>Sometimes in PoH we 
           will get a delayed pull and all the sudden we will have a spite golem 
           beating on us. There are mobs out there that cannot be mesed. If you see 
           the MA shout his target again, please hit your assist hotkey again. OK, 
           you did it? You hit your assist key again? Well do it 2 more times to be 
           sure. You can hit your hotkey anytime you are somehow unsure that you are 
           on the correct target. Re-assisting is a good habit to get into. There 
           might be a rare occasion that we get 2 unmessable MOBs at the same time. 
           In this instance, it is permissible for the SA to target the additional 
           MOB and tank it while the first is being killed. Unless you happen to be 
           the SA, or the SA's cleric, this will not concern you… please continue to 
           beat the living snot out of the MA's target. 
           <P>/shout:<BR>Raid Leader, MA, SA, Lootmaster, Raid Police. If you are not 
           on that list, please do not use shout unless we have an emergency that 
           jeopardizes the entire raid. You may use /ooc, but please try to keep the 
           chatter down, especially during periods of heavy action or when the Raid 
           Leader is trying to communicate. If you are a group leader and your group 
           gets a kill, you can use shout to call the loot, some raid leaders prefer 
           to reserve the /auction channel for calling loot. Which brings us too: 
           <P>Pets:<BR>Pets have the tendency to mess things up for the enchanters. 
           ie: I have my skeleton pet up, I assist and send my pet to attack the main 
           assist's target. I sit down and an additional MOB (add) shows up out of 
           nowhere and hits me. That add gets mesed, but my pet remembers that I got 
           hit. Anytime during that fight, my pet could decide that it hates that add 
           that hit me a while ago and it will run over and hit it, waking it up. 
           This gets the enchanter, then my pet, and then myself killed. Pets and mes 
           don't mix well. I do understand that some of you can control your pets 
           better than that, I can too, but I don't put one up unless asked. There is 
           too much to loose if you make just one mistake with your pet and it 
           usually does not merit the risk. Anytime that you have the chance at 
           getting more than one MOB in a raid situation you should leave the pet at 
           home. Mages can Nuke and Necros can help the enchanters with Crowd control 
           and do their very low resist lifetap line to help deal the damage. 
           <P>DoTs:<BR>Damage over Time, a necro's best friend. Sorry, my dark 
           brothers, for the most part, DoT's are not allowed in raid situations and 
           here is why. If the MA has to switch targets, the old target can be put to 
           sleep by the enchanters, but not if it has a DoT on it. The damage every 
           tick will wake it back up, making it very angry at both you and the 
           enchanter that is trying to mes it, yet another situation where both you 
           and the enchanter ends up dead. 
           <P>Loot!:<BR>I knew you put up with all those rules for a reason. If you 
           are a group leader, you will check the loot for your group if you get a 
           kill. If you are not a group leader, you will not check loot unless 
           directly asked to by the Raid leader or Lootmaster. If you are a group 
           leader, and do not want the chore of checking loot, please assign the duty 
           to one of your group that you trust. 
           <P>OK, you are a group leader and just checked a Boogyman's dead and 
           twitching body. On the body are: a blighted robe (necromancer, no drop), a 
           Blue Diamond, Words of Bondage and Ruby Crown. You need to /shout Necro 
           Robe and BD on Boogie. No drop items, rare gems and rare droppable items 
           get called out. Cash loot, research components and other weird things do 
           not need to be called. You will get to know what needs to be called and 
           what can be ignored after a while, that is why the Raid leader tries to 
           pick seasoned experts as the group leaders. If that Boogyman only had a 
           sapphire necklace on it, you could call out /shout Boogie-MT. MT is short 
           for Empty. All cash loot and droppable items should go to the Lootmaster. 
           The Lootmaster's job is to rout all that loot to the correct people and to 
           call for rolls when they are appropiate. Please do not random unless the 
           Lootmaster has instructed you to. It is disruptive. 
           <P>Clerics and Enchanter will get most of the cash loot to cover the costs 
           of buying Peridots to Symbol and Rune you guys to keep you alive. One 
           peridot is 10pp, and they will go through more that one stack a night on a 
           raid. 
           <P>Rare Gems will be rolled on at the very end of the raid. If you won 
           something during the raid, you will not be rolling for the rare gems. My 
           goal is to have everyone leave with something from the raid. It is not 
           frequently met. The Rare gems are Blue Diamond (BD), Diamond, Jacinth, and 
           Black Sapphire (BS). All other gems are considered cash loot and will be 
           given to the clerics and enchanters to cover buffing expenses. 
           <P>Research components and craft skill items will be distributed as the 
           Lootmaster sees fit. 
           <P>The Lootmaster will call for rolls on no drop items as soon as possible 
           after the drop. If you win a no drop item, please do not expect get to 
           roll again until all of your class has won a similar item. ie: the cleric 
           bracer drops and you win it, if the cleric BP drops later and the other 
           cleric on the raid has not won anything, they will be taking it home with 
           them. Once all of a class has won an item from their class armour, all can 
           roll again. 
           <P>Sometimes one member of a class is LD or has been killed when there has 
           been a drop for their class. It is a Group Leader's responsibility to make 
           the Lootmaster aware if you have a LD or dead person that should get a 
           roll. In most cases, the Raid Leader or Group Leader will roll in place of 
           the missing person. The preferred method is to get the person in question 
           resurrected so they can roll for themselves. If be chance a LD person does 
           win a roll by proxy, they will have 5 minutes to get back in game and loot 
           their prize. After 5 minutes the next highest roll should win. 
           <P>Reserves that come up after the break is done: we have a one hour no 
           looting rule. Some raiding guilds have a 2 hour rule, some have no rule. I 
           believe that the people that worked hard to break the plane, tupically the 
           riskiest time of the raid, should be rewarded with a little bit better 
           odds to get the loot that drops. This one hour rule also insures that the 
           following situation never occurs: reserves are brought up, the mage robe 
           drops. There are 2 mages one that has been there working hard for hours 
           and the one that just spent 10 mins. They roll off and the 10 min mage 
           wins and decided that he is done for the night and gates out. You have to 
           contribute at LEAST an hour to an endeavour to be considered for loot. 
           This rule can be waived at the raid leader's discretion, but woe to the 
           raid leader who finds himself in that hypothetical situation. 
           <P>Raids have more than one part:<BR>There are 5 distinct parts of a raid. 
           Groupmaking, the Break, the Raid, sometimes an Epic battle, and the Loot 
           handout. 
           <P>Groupmaking is long and boring for everyone except the groupmaker. That 
           poor sot is being hammered with 3 tells per second and has to try to write 
           people's information down and form balanced groups at the same time This 
           will take between 10 and 90 minutes. 
           <P>The Break is perhaps the time of most uncertainty and excitement. This 
           can be a very chaotic time, with some going link dead, feeling disoriented 
           upon zoning in and running the wrong way, perhaps MA and SA both go down 
           and no one is sure what is going on. All kinds of room for failure here. 
           The key thing to remember on a planes break is to keep your enchanters 
           alive. They will be working overtime to get any MOBs under control. They 
           will be risking their lives so that all may live. If the enchanters stay 
           alive, we will win. The second key thing is to listen carefully to the 
           directions for the break. The raid leader may call for everyone to be 
           invis, or perhaps there will be specific instructions on where to run to 
           when you zone in. The break takes from 20 minutes to 2 hours. 
           <P>The Raid takes from 3-12 hours to get though depending on stamina, 
           people leaving, availability of reserves and how fast we can plow through 
           the MOBs. 
           <P>The Epic Fight is another part that does not always occur. They will be 
           taken on only if we have the proper manpower to take the MOB down. This 
           part usually takes around an hour. Epic parts will be open roll for the 
           class that needs them. Sometimes a raid will be run to get a specific 
           person a specific epic part, if this is the case, it will be part of the 
           raid announcement and that person will get part without a roll. 
           <P>The loot takes a while to get through as well. We will either do loot 
           after the last pull is finished, or we will all evacuate to Toxx forest 
           and meet at the bridge for rolls on droppable things and rare gems. Some 
           of the key players in the raid might be awarded a rare gem without having 
           to roll. They worked hard for you, please respect the Lootmaster and Raid 
           Leader in the calls they have made. The loot handout takes from 10 minutes 
           to an hour. 
           <P>Specific to Plane of Hate: <BR>The meeting spot for Plane of Hate (PoH) 
           is traditionally the Wizzie Spires in South Ro. It costs 250pp per group 
           to go up to hate. This is for the Soulstones that the raid leader buys in 
           Neriak. You need one stone(250pp) per group that is going up, and at least 
           3 extras, for emergencies. Once in Hate, there is no evac, if a fight goes 
           very badly, we will call CLERICS CAMP NOW. When the train is done, they 
           can come back and res us all. After all cleric have camped out safely, you 
           may attempt to camp out as well, in that situation .As a general Rule 
           after clerics have camped, please log on as an alternate character (if you 
           lived) and give the raid leader a tell. The raid leader should set his 
           /AFK message to something like "Safe to log back in" or "Not safe to log 
           back in". 
           <P>Specific to the Plane of Fear:<BR>The meeting spot for Plane of Fear 
           (PoF) is traditionally the PoF Portal in the specter cave in Ferrott. BTW 
           invis vs undead does not work against those specters and they have to be 
           cleared. </P></TD>
