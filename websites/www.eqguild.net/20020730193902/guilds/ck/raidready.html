        <tr> 
          <td> <h3>What is a raid?</h3>
            Usually it can be defined as an attempt to defeat a target in EQ that 
            is too tough to be defeated by one group of 6 people. With 2 or more 
            groups a new type of coordination is required, and this is called 
            Raiding. 
            <h3>What a raid IS NOT</h3>
            It is usually not a time to get experience from killing mobs. Prepare 
            yourself for this. You will <b>probably not be in an experience getting 
            group</b>. Raids are formed to go after large targets that drop valuable 
            equipment that <b>make the entire alliance stronger</b>. Along the 
            way to those targets much equipment and spells will drop that you 
            will be eligable to roll on. The focus is the final mob, the excitement 
            of knowing your group of friends can overcome large obstacles by cooperation, 
            and having a good time along with your friends. 
            <h3>Do you qualify?</h3>
            <p>To be raid ready there are TWO primary qualifiers for your character 
              to participate. <strong>Level </strong>and <strong>Resistance</strong>.
            <p>Why does my character have to be a certain <strong>level</strong> 
              for some raids?
            <ul>
              <li>Only certain levels of character have a chance to land spells 
                on the target mob. 
              <li>Only melee of high enough level can achieve a reasonable number 
                of hits on the mob. 
              <li>If your level is too low the casts and possible Area Effect 
                spells the mob uses will hit you more often requiring more healing 
                attention. 
              <li>If you sit down to meditate your level + sitting will produce 
                a wider circle of agro radius to nearby mobs. 
              <li>And..specifically in the planes...the game won't even let you 
                go there unless you are level 46+. You just bounce.<br>
                (<em>Aww please...can't I just show up..not help to kill the mobs..and 
                grab some great loot???</em>....<strong>NO!</strong>)
            </ul>
            <p>What does <strong>resistance</strong> have to do with anything?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Virtually all higher level mobs cast spells on players. Some 
                have Area Effect spells that affect all nearby players. </li>
              <li>The spells generally cause damage to players. The ammount of 
                damage is determined by... 
                <ul>
                  <li> Your level vs. the mob's level (are you blue to it or is 
                    it blue to you?)</li>
                  <li>Your resistance to they kind of magic the mob is using (fire, 
                    cold, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>If you are getting hurt too much the healers can't properly 
                protect the primary melee members.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What is the most important thing to know?</h3>
            
            #1 - <b><font size=+1>ASSIST</font></b> .. what...really..thats it?? 
            <b>YES!</b>. 
            <p>I will discuss many other subjects here but that is the most important 
              item. When you arrive at your first raid YOU WILL BE A JUNIOR MEMBER. 
              You will not be the one engaging the targets first and so you must 
              assist. 
            <h3>How do I become raid ready?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Acquire enough gear to meet resistance requirements.</li>
              <li>Level your character to the minimum required level.</li>
              <li>Prepare your hotkeys.</li>
              <li>Learn how to use chat channels.</li>
              <li>Know <a href="theFight.html"><strong>The Process of the Raid</strong></a>.</li>
              <li><a href="assisting.html">Learn how to assist.</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>I'm raid ready...what do I do before my first raid?</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Read up on the zone you will be fighting in to know what mobs 
                to expect, what tactics will be used on those mobs, and what your 
                role will be in those tactics. 
              <li>Read up on what equipment will be dropping along the way to 
                the final mob, and the drops on the final mob itself. Why? So 
                during a trek throug the dungeon the drop coordinator won't have 
                to explain multiple times the statistics on each item being "randomed". 
              <li>Get your resist gear from bank FIRST. (no really you'd be suprised 
                how many forget) 
              <li>Have an <strong><a href="assisting.html">assist</a></strong><a href="assisting.html"> 
                hotkey</a> prepared. 
              <li>Have appropriate spells purchased and memorized. 
              <li>Arrive to gathering point on time. 
              <li>Know <a href="theFight.html"><strong>The Process of the Raid</strong></a>.
            </ol>
