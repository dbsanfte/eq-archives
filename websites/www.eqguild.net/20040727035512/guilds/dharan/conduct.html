<b> Guild Representation </b> <hr>
Every member of this guild is an emissary of The D'Haran Empire throughout the Lands of Norrath and should act in a manner that reflects and upholds the honor of the Empire. This includes how your character behaves throughout all aspects of the game and all communications within and regarding the game.  Always remember that your actions reflect the guild as a whole. While it is not possible to be polite in all situations, please do your best. <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     
<b> Guild Tags </b> <hr>
Using the "roleplaying" feature is allowed, however, playing "anonymous" is prohibited. 
This suppresses your guild tag from view and hides your character from the guild member list.
As a member of the guild your character should where the guild tag proudly. <br>
<br>
Exception:
If you are in attendance of a guild raid, /roleplay should NOT be used as this hinders raid commanders ability to plan groups and organize raid strategy.  During a raid your characters class and level should be visible. To eliminate display clutter from tags you should adjust the display option to reduce names to just the first name during raids. <br>
     <br>
     <br> 

<b> Chivalry  </b> <hr>
Everyone in the guild should be supportive of one another.  This increases the guild's overall experience, strength and morale.  We are in the guild to be part of a circle of friends.  Members are encouraged to group with their guild mates as often as possible. However, members are not allowed to DEMAND assistance from their guild mates.  Begging or harassing another member to come help you is prohibited. <br>
<br> Guild members are encouraged to be helpful to each other and may be requested to do favors for other members.  Please note that it is customary, however not required, to compensate lower level players for their assistance in matters such as item transfers.  For favors involving a great deal of effort or time consumption (ie: continuous foraging, collecting items for use in improving trade skills or to be turned in for faction) should be compensated. <br>
<br> Asking another guild member for items (especially lore and hard to get ones) with the intent of sale for profit is inappropriate and prohibited. If you are requesting assistance in acquiring an item, that item shall be for the benefit of the character represented in the request and NOT to profit from the benevolence of your companions.  It is unacceptable to take advantage of your guild-mates in any manner.<br>
<br> <b> It is unacceptable to repeatedly ask other Guild members for ports, corpse retrievals, resurrections, equipment, and other things you may desire. Many will help you in such situations, but it is at the discretion of the individual and only at their convenience. Keep in mind that your Guild-mates will not always be available to help you, but we will make every effort to do so. </b> <br>
     <br>
     <br>

<b> Power Leveling  </b> <hr>
Power Leveling is not forbidden however is NOT to be expected. No guild member may request power leveling from any other character in the game (guild member or otherwise).  Guild members are allowed to offer to power level other members at their discretion.  Asking is prohibited, offering is allowed.<br>
     <br>
     <br>

<b> Begging </b> <hr>
Begging for cash or items is strictly prohibited. Begging is any repeated asking or pleading that becomes annoying or distracting to other members. Anyone found doing so may be warned ONCE and reminded that constant begging will result in removal from the guild.  As a general rule, if you ask once and are refused <b> DO NOT </b> ask again. <br>
     <br>
     <br>

<b> Guild Communications </b> <hr>
It is generally considered good manners to say hello and good-bye in guild chat to announce your presence and departure.  This is not required, but helps to build a feeling of community amongst the guild members and a friendly atmosphere.
<br><br>
You should announce to the guild when you level, we are here to encourage each other.  However, you are still responsible for contacting the Guild Scribe (in game, by email, or by posting on the message board) regularly to insure that your level is current on the member roster.
<br><br>
Auctioning items in Guild chat is an acceptable practice provided that the person auctioning the item is not spamming the guild with their auction request. Please limit auctioning in guild chat to reasonable intervals.
<br><br>
<b>Do not change the MOTD unless advised by the Guild Leader to do so. </b><br>
     <br>
     <br>

<b> Language and Conduct </b> <hr>
<b> There will be absolutely NO naming calling, insulting, chiding, belittling, etc. of other players ESPECIALLY in guild chat.  Rude or obnoxious behavior of any kind is unacceptable. </b>
<br> <br>
The use of foul and offensive language is expressly <b> prohibited </b> in group with non-guild members, shout, ooc, auction, and on the message board.
<br> <br>
The use of foul and offensive language is not encouraged in Guild Chat.  This includes profanity, derogatory language and inappropriate subject matter.  However, none of us are perfect and occasionally (especially when a good pull goes bad) we let a few graphic expletives slip out. As long as foul language is held to a minimum, no disciplinary action will be taken.  If you have a particular problem with swearing (ie: your children may be watching) make sure that the game's bad word filter is on. (/filter)  Please use your best judgment and refrain from particularly offensive words or phrases. <br>
     <br>
Please refrain from engaging in sexually explicit conversation with strangers. 
     <br>
     <br>

<b> Quests </b> <hr>
Members are encouraged to assist other guild members in <b> helping </b> fulfill quests. 
<br><br>
The Quest Commander or Guild Leader may be consulted at any time with questions regarding quests.  Neither the Quest Commander nor Guild Leader are required to give details on the quest completion or complete the quests for the member.  The guild will provide only direction, assistance and hints.  
<br><br>
Upper level guild members will not be expected to camp an item for you. If you want a hard to get LORE/QUEST item you must be of sufficient level to help participate in the questing for the item.
<br><br>
A forum is available on the message board wherein members may request assistance or information on quests. <br>
     <br>
     <br>

<b> Hunting, Grouping and Camping Guidelines  </b> <hr>
Kill stealing is strictly prohibited. 
<br><br>
Members shall never intentionally train other players. 
<br><br>
Accidental kill stealing and training does happen on occassion, but this can be a basis for removal from the guild if the behavior is found to be intentional or habitual.
<br><br>
Members shall not steal camps from other players.  Exception: High-level character camping a low level mob (ex. level 50 player camping CB for belts). In this case, the lower level group may take whatever mobs they manage to kill. 
<br><br>
While playing in a group, all members should remember that they are responsible for whether their character lives or dies. In other words, if your character is in trouble, don't expect others to save you or to take the blame if you didn't try to escape soon enough.
<br><br>
Ninja looting is strictly prohibited. "Ninja looting" is looting while your group is fighting an add or hovering over another group's kill trying to loot it. Most people will not mind letting others loot a corpse or two or passing off a no drop item that they cannot use; however, be sure to ask. This will alleviate confusion and unintended hard feelings between characters, guild members and other guilds. <br>
     <br>
     <br>

<b> Intra-Guild Disputes </b> <hr>
If you are having difficulties with any Guild member or one of our Allies, please contact an officer or the Guild Leader and the problem will be investigated and dealt with.  All guild members should know who the guild officers are. If you do not know the guild officers go to the member roster and check.
<br><br>
When members disagree with one another, PLEASE keep it civil and between individuals. Please keep the disagreement in Tells and out of Guild Chat. If the dispute cannot be resolved, contact the Guild Leader or any officer who is online. DO NOT bring other individuals into the dispute. <br>
     <br>
     <br>

<b> Complaints </b> <hr>
In the event of a complaint made against a guild member to the Guild Leader or officers, that member (or group of members) shall have the option of a hearing among the officers and mediation with the Guild Leader.  The hearing will be held on a private chat channel and will include all parties involved in the dispute and all officers that are available.  After both parties are given the opportunity to present their side of the dispute, the officers will then vote on the appropriate course of action. The decision may be appealed to the Guild Leader.  Guild Leader mediation results are final.  
<br><br>
Neither the hearing nor mediation is an accusation or assumption of guilt.  It is only an opportunity for all sides of the dispute to be heard to facilitate an educated judgment. <br>
     <br>
     <br>
<b> Removal from the Guild </b> <hr>
Upon known violation of any of these guidelines a private warning will be issued to the member in question.  Upon repeat violation the member will be issued a second warning and will be put upon probation.  The Guild Leader may chose to consult the officer council regarding members on probation.  Consistent offenses will result in removal from the guild.<br>
