        Befallen, like most of the dungeons in the game are designed the deeper ya go the harder it gets. &nbsp;you would do alright with an ho buff on ya and some agility and haste. &nbsp;we would group ya with the people closest to your level, if no one else is on, i have a monk nearby thats level 13
