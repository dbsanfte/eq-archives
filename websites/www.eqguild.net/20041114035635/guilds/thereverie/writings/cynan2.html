THE HANDKERCHIEF
<br><br><br>

He staggers through the desert<br>
Nothin' in his pockets<br>
But a worn out wallet <br>
and four lousy bucks.<br><br>

Buzzards circle above his head<br>
waiting for his invitation.<br>
He chuckles when he thinks<br>
about where he's been.<br><br>

Not a lot of difference <br>
where he's been and where he's going.<br>
Seems noone cares about the beginning<br>
or the end of a tramp.<br><br>

He continues walking. The hot sand<br>
scorching through his soleless shoes<br>
while he wipes away the sweat <br>
with a filthy handkerchief.<br><br>

His parched body won't allow the tears<br>
that should fall as he looks at the silk initial.<br>
One last sorrowful sigh and he falls to his knees.<br>
The heat greets his soul and escorts it away.<br><br>

The swirling wind tears the handkerchief<br>
from his deadman's grip<br>
and carries it to the heart of the desert.<br><br>

No, noone cares about the beginning <br>
or the end<br>
of a tramp.<br><br><br>
