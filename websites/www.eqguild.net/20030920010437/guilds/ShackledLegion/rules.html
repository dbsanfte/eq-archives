 <p><font size=+1>Joining and Leaving</font>
 <blockquote><font size=+1>1. To join the guild, you must be an iksar monk.&nbsp;</font>
 <br><font size=+1>2. We are currently accepting members between levels
 3 and 20. This will change as current members progress through the levels.
 This is not a hard and fast rule, so if you are beyond the current level
 cap and wish to join, ask an officer. Obviously, if you advance beyond
 the current level cap while in the guild, that is not a problem.</font>
 <br><font size=+1>3. We may be initiating a starting package of equipment
 to give to new members if they need it.</font>
 <br><font size=+1>4. If you decide to leave the guild for any reason, we
 would appreciate it if you told an officer that you were leaving and why.
 Also, the return of any items that you borrowed from the guild bank is
 required. If you borrowed anything from another guild member, settle the
 matter with them.</font>
 <br><font size=+1></font>&nbsp;</blockquote>
 <font size=+1>General Conduct</font>
 <blockquote><font size=+1>1. DO NOT BEG. It is not appreciated by anyone,
 and we do not want to listen to spam from beggars. You may certainly ask
 for help, but realize that other people may be busy at the moment, and
 if they cannot help, do not annoy them.</font>
 <br><font size=+1>2. Do not kill steal, purposely train, or otherwise violate
 the "play-nice policy" instituted by Verant, for any reason. This is not
 excused by saying that you were acting in the name of evil or roleplaying
 an evil character. There are other, more accepted ways of demostrating
 your alignment.</font>
 <br><font size=+1>3. Help your fellow guild members.&nbsp; This is to clarify
 the other side of the do no beg rule.&nbsp; Just because somebody is asking
 for help does not mean they are begging.&nbsp; While you are not obligated
 to assist every member with every request, anything you can do is for the
 better, and will be appreciated by all members of the guild.</font>
 <br><font size=+1></font>&nbsp;</blockquote>
 <font size=+1>Guild Banks:&nbsp; Use and Abuse</font>
 <blockquote><font size=+1>1.&nbsp; There will eventually be guild banks
 located throughout Norrath for the convenience of guild members.&nbsp;
 These will provide ATM service where iksar are generally not welcome (i.e.
 Everywhere).&nbsp; They will also be used to hold items that members wish
 to donate to the guild, as well as supplies for trade skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
 <br><font size=+1>2.&nbsp; As mentioned above, if you have borrowed an
 item or money from the guild bank, and plan to leave the guild, you must
 return everything that you have borrowed.</font>
 <br><font size=+1>3.&nbsp; If you simply want to deposit money in a guild
 bank, rather than using one for an ATM, we will write down the amount deposited,
 and you will be able to withdraw it from any other bank... between the
 hours of 9 and 5 (j/k).&nbsp; On the other hand, if you have not deposited
 money, do not attempt to rip us off.&nbsp; It is not needed, as you are
 allowed to take loans from the guild bank, provided you have an actual
 reason other than "I like money."</font>
 <br><font size=+1>4.&nbsp; Feel free to donate money and items to the guild
 bank, as that is the only way it will remain supplied.&nbsp; The leader
 and officers are in no way solely responsible for this task.</font>
 <br><font size=+1>5.&nbsp; If you wish to remove the items and money that
 you donated to the bank when you are leaving the guild, then you may.&nbsp;
 Once again, we will be keeping track of donations.&nbsp; If somebody else
 has borrowed the items, we will ask them to return them to you.</font>
 <br><font size=+1>6.&nbsp; Obviously you should never sell anything that
 you have borrowed from the guild bank.</font></blockquote>
 <font size=+1>Trade Skills</font>
 <blockquote><font size=+1>1.&nbsp; Trade Skill Supplies -&nbsp; There will
 be a list on the members page of which members have generously volunteered
 to use their trade skills for the good of the Legion.&nbsp; They will be
 known as our Guild Artisans.&nbsp; These people will be donating their
 time, and most likely their money, to help better equip the rest of us.&nbsp;
 Show them consideration by donating any trade skill supplies that you come
 across to the guild bank, rather than selling them for personal profit.</font>
 <br><font size=+1>2.&nbsp; If one of our Artisans gives you something for
 free, such as a set of cured silk armor, never, under any circumstances,
 sell it.&nbsp; It is not a nice thing to do, and if you no longer need
 the items given to you, it is expected that you will donate them to the
 guild bank.</font></blockquote>
 <font size=+1>Raiding Policies</font>
 <blockquote><font size=+1>These will be established at a later date.</font></blockquote>
