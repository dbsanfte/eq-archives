              that is necessary). Members are encouraged to talk to the online 
              council members if ANY guild member is bothering you in any way. 
              The council will talk about your complaints and deal with them, 
              in most likely one of three ways: We will talk to the problem player 
              and suggest changes in behaivor/action, We will if deemed necessary 
              convine a public guild trail, or removal.</p>

            <p><b>Membership<br>
              </b><u>Note to memberships after April 2002.</u> We are currently only taking a very few selected players below lvl 50. Other certain classes have their min lvl set to the following lvls ( Rangers 57+ Shadow Knights 55+ Pallys 55+ Druids 54ish )
<br><br>Players seeking membership in our family must be minimum level 
              of 40. They must be someone with whom friendships exist with our 
              members that most likely developed while grouping. These people 
              need 2 members to sponsor them and will be on a 2-week probation 
              period. During this 2-week period, any officer can /guildremove 
              them at will should they prove to be dishonorable. After that 2-week 
              period ONLY the council can remove a member after any officer has 
              asked for a majority vote. If this recruit is a stranger (40 +), 
              he will be directed to the recruitment officer(s) and asked to group/raid 
              with us for up to 2-weeks before he will receive an invite. Does 
              that mean anyone under 40 cannot join or anyone currently under 
              40 has to leave NO! It means that anyone under 40 must be part of 
              the mentoring program. It also means that people seeking membership 
              under 40 must have 2 sponsors and can only join if someone will 
              mentor them. In any case, no one will be given an invite until the 
              recruitment officer(s) gives us the ok having done the BACKGROUND 
              check on the person. Background check will include a line of questioning, 
              speaking to the recruits previous guild leaders, researching the 
              server website boards for Rant/Flames on them, and possibly contacting 
              a former guild or a guide to inquire about any potential issues.</p>
            <p><b>Dues<br>
              </b>Dues equal to the level of your main char will be paid to the 
              guild banker once monthly by each member. This will help us to build 
              a bank in order to fund major purchases and raid equipment like 
              coffins for corpse summons, peridots for symbols, pearls for call 
              of the hero, and gems for port to the planes etc. For example, at 
              level 60, Xalik would pay 60plat per month to guild bank. If you 
              have two mains on two different accounts you will have to pay for 
              BOTH your mains.</p>
            <p><br>
              <b>Officers<br>
              </b>Before you may become an officer you must be 50+, mentor at 
              least one person to 50, have all your basic keys {(HS, OS, and Sky 
              Shrine; later this will include other keys}, and have all the EverQuest 
              expansions. If you meet these requirements, an existing officer 
              may nominate you to a position. A majority vote of the current panel 
              of officers will make you an officer. Should any of the council 
              members VETO the vote, a majority vote of the council will be needed 
              to become an officer then. </p>

              <b>Mentors</b><br>
              In order to help our guild grow and to keep our lower level members 
              from feeling left-out or forgotten, and promote unity, we have adopted 
              the Mentor program. Basically this means that any member under level 
              40 will be paired up with a member over 50 as Mentor and Apprentice. 
              The pair need not be the same class, as it will give them opportunity 
              to learn one another's class. The Mentor will be responsible for 
              helping his Apprentice more so than the entire guild. He/She will 
              be the go to person for questions and guidance help with basic gear, 
              camping items, learning group/raid roles and responsibilities, leveling 
              etc. The vision for this is that the Mentor/Apprentice relationship 
              will be one of friendship much like if the two players were friends 
              in real life. This is not a license to expect power leveling or 
              twinkage remember the mentor still has to get to 60 too. My recommendation 
              is that the pair spends one or two nights a week together (Tuesday 
              and Thursday were suggested). This gives the mentor a chance to 
              play his/her lower level alt if so desired. During these times goals 
              and strategies should be set. For example, where to hunt for XP 
              and what to do when the mentor is busy with other things. The guild 
              advisor will ask for updates and speak with both the mentor and 
              apprentice to see how things are progressing. The guild advisor 
              will award points for participating in this program. Also, Mentoring 
              is one way to becoming an officer doubtful you will be considered 
              if you haven't ever been a mentor. The guild advisor will pair up 
              people. If you are not paired up the guild advisor will contact 
              you and feel free to remind him/her if he/she becomes too busy. 
            </p>
            <p><br>
              <b>Guild Tag</b><br>
              Aegis of Unity members are not permitted to use the /anon flag unless 
              extreme circumstances are approved by Council. We understand there 
              are times many of us do not want our class or level to be known. 
              If this is the case your welcome to use /role-play to hide from 
              spam tells for ports and resurrections. We want to know when our 
              members are on and wear our guild tag with pride.</p>
            <p><br>
              <b>Twinking</b><br>
              Power Leveling and Twinking is NOT a GUILD supported practice. (We 
              will not help you twink your alt or your friend.) If you choose 
              to twink, you will not be frowned upon, but you will do so on your 
              own. The guild will not help you get an item that you can not participate 
              and contribute in getting. (No level 5 Ranger/Warrior is going to 
              bet Tolans or Cobalt armor if they cannot get into OS and help with 
              the kill). </p>
