Trying to get caught up, but failing miserably!  This guild is just too darn active!  Woot - keep it up!
<p>
<p>
<b>April 1, 2003</b> -- Since the scheduled patch did not take place, several members of the Legion had a rather interesting pickup group.  While assisting Ishtarrak in his hunt for Snow Griffons in the Eastern Wastes, Regnus accidentally zoned into Sleeper's Tomb by clicking on it.  Apparently no key was needed as the last guild in there had forgotten to lock it on the way out.  The full report is forthcoming, along with several screenshots, but suffice it to say that Arrythmia would have an unlimited supply of rolling heads in here!
<p>
<p>
<b>March 30, 2003</b> -- Reflexia has announced her pursuit of the Druid Epic, so it is time for me to update the Epic pages again and put up the outline for this quest.
<p>
<p>
<b>March 27, 2003</b> -- The Thursday Night 46+ Hunting Party visited Dulak's Harbor.  The hunting took place primarily in the large warehouse.  Even though Reflexia was not able to get the spell component she is looking for, and in spite of Eliyena's link death after death stuff, the group still managed to loot a nice earring, blue diamond and star rose quartz.  All in all, a pretty good night!
<p>
<p>
<b>March 23, 2003</b> -- A raid on the Warrens was held to give our lower level characters (no one over 25 level was allowed!) a chance to shine.  Shine they did -- a quick march to clear out the Prince side was followed up by taking down the Throne Room and then proceeding to the Stonebrunt Zone.  A well disciplined group ensured that there were no deaths and plenty of fun!
<p>
<p>
<b>March 22, 2003</b> -- The General led a group of Legionnaires through the dungeon of Najena.  The raid, though small, was successful with no deaths.
<p>
<p>
<b>March 14, 2003 </b>-- After hearing of the successes of guild members excursions into the dungeon of Kaesora, a full Guild Raid was held.  With a good turnout of well disciplined troops and the General as our MA, the raid was smooth and successful!  Xalgoz decided to die for the Legion twice!
<p>
<p>
<b>March 8, 2003 </b>-- The Legion hosted their second Guild Auction and first Royal Rumble in the Bazaar Arena.  The auction again provided members with an opportunity to purchase items for bargain prices while helping the Legion's coffers.  The Rumble went well at first until a 65th Necro from another guild decided to prove his "manliness" by PK-ing Legionnaires 25 levels below him.  All in all - still a fun event for all!
<p>
<p>
<b>March 2, 2002</b> -- Our first exploration of the new regions of the Broken Skull Clan.  A small group of us (General Pallidmortis, Parfie, Bemin, Zyixi, Syscrsher, Aerea, and Ishtarrak) explored the Guld of Gunthak and came away wanting more.  Decent experience, excellent single pulling, and a well organized group allowed us to explore the tunnel leading to the Crypt of Nadox as well as the Marauder village.
<p>

<b>February 2002</B> -- Eliyena Eliminstrss decides to blaze a trail for the guild and goes go <A HREF="http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/FLoO/elivox.html"><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> dragon hunting </B></FONT></A>. <B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="CENTER"> </P>
