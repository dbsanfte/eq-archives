        I'm gutted- my favourite EQ sites, EqMaps, is to become a subscription only site- looks like the whole free thing is about to change in the near future.  <br> <br>Having suffered a lay off myself I can fully sympathise- just hope these guys dont grab all the good sites! <br> <br>Here's the bit from the front of the page for those of you interested. <br> <br>EQ Maps has been online for almost a year and a half now, my first news post dates back to 11/07/1999. I have learned so much about programming, EverQuest, people, and myself that I can truly say it has been a life changing experience. The last few months have been very challenging, EQ Maps has switched between 3 different gaming networks since the beginning of the year, UGO, GameGlow, and finally Crossroads/CNET. You might wonder why that is?  <br> <br>For those of you that don't know, running a web site the size of EQ Maps (over 1000 Gigabyes of downloads/traffic per month) costs thousands of dollars every month. In the past that cost was balanced by revenue generated from banner advertising. Well, unfortunately for me and *every* other webmaster out there, banner advertising revenue has hit rock bottom and most likely will never come back. Not only have I barely been able to cover server costs, some months I wasn't paid at all.  <br> <br>Because of the insane server costs I have been forced to make a drastic decision. I have looked at all the alternatives, and I have come to the best decision for EQ Maps and its visitors. I am asking all of you EQ Maps fans, who have come here time after time to find your EverQuest spoiler information, quickly and easily, to sign up for a Flashlink membership. For as little as 7 *cents* a day you will prevent EQ Maps from going offline, and will get full access to EQ Maps and over 35 other gaming web sites.  <br> <br>Flashlink is a multi-site subscription service that gives you full access to an ever growing list of premium web sites. Every subscription comes with a free 14 day trail period, so there is absolutely no risk to you. Even better, if you sign up between now and and June 1st, 2001 you will be automatically entered into a drawing for a GeForce 3 graphics card! I encourage everyone to visit the Flashlink web site to learn more and see the complete list of sites you will get access to. I thank you for signing up for Flashlink and supporting EQ Maps.  <br> <br>Very Sincerely, <br>NiteRaven <br> <br>PS. The Map List, Advanced Item List, and Search Database pages will remain free as long as we are able to cover server costs. <br> <br>Khazbee <br>

        That sucks...now I have to get lost without maps. <br> <br>It always made me feel safer when I was lost and had a map...I could always turn it upside down and try to see shapes as I maneuvered my way through a zone by tracking anything that looked like a guard's name ;P <br>
