 Once 2 guilds have decided that they will form a Common Union together, they must plan how they will work together. There are details they need to agree on for fairness to both guilds.
 
 <p>
 The decision makers for the Common Union must be chosen to schedule and organize CU activities. This can be made of a few chosen officers from both guild and even the entire leadership from both guilds. Regardless of who is chosen these people from both guilds are responsible for ensuring the CU is running well and accomplishing what it was intended to.
 
 <p>
 The CU leadership must decide on acceptable goals for the guilds to pursue. These goals might take 1-2 weeks depending on how difficult and most importantly how dedicated the guilds are to accomplishing the goals. Since the helping guild at the time must help ensure their partner's goal is accomplished before they receive anything from their next goal, they will be driven to work their hardest to help the other guild achieve their goal. (lack of help from them: longer wait until their own goal is started)
 
 <p>
 During each goal, all items and money go to the guild that is working on its goal. This includes cash loot and items that would only be sold. The only exceptions would be lore and no drop items. The reason is that the current goal guild is the one trying to increase its strength. It will drive the helping guild to achieve their partner's goal as quickly as reasonably possible. The helping guild will get the same in return when their next goal is worked on.<br>
 <b>Lore:</b> When all present members of the current goal guild have the item.<br>
 <b>No Drop:</b> When all present members of the current goal guild that will use the item have the item.<br>
 The CU leadership is free to decide whether to cover the costs of the helping guild during each goal.
