             <p>The Guardians of Truth are one of the many guilds of Everquest, 
               but we'd like to think that we are one of the best. Why is that? 
               Because we are an interesting and very diverse group and we form 
               a cohesive family, always helping each other out. We can be found 
               on the Morell-Thule server, and we include members from almost every 
               race and class possible. Our members and officers are found on every 
               continent of Norrath. Because we are a relatively young guild, without 
               high level restrictions, we are growing rapidly. Our members range 
               from the very low levels to characters in their lower 50's. To find 
               out more about our philosophy and rules, read on. If you are interested 
               in joining, contact one of our officers in Norrath or send us an 
               email and we'll look you up. </p>

               Creed</b></i></font></div>
           </td>
         </tr>
         <tr valign="top"> 
           <td>Our philosophy is relatively simple: we believe in helping others. 
             We realize that the world of Norrath is a wonderful place, but is 
             not without considerable challenges and dangers. Everyone in Everquest 
             has had a fairy godmother or a knight in shining armor swoop in and 
             help them out at some time or other. Helping each other is what makes 
             roleplaying great. Unlike many other guilds, we do not have a high 
             level limit for members to join. Anyone level 8 or over is welcome. 
             This is because we realize that often, low level characters need the 
             most help, and we would like to be there to help them out. If you 
             agree with our philosophy, please consider joining our family.

           <td>1. All new members must have attained at least level 8 to be considered 
             for membership in the guild. <br>
             2. All new members (and old members who haven't done so yet) must 
             register with our <a href="http://communities.msn.com/EQGuardiansoftheTruth/messageboard.msnw" target="_blank">forum</a> 
             and with our <a href="member.html">member list on guild magic</a>. 
             Guild officers will record the name of each new recruit and will enforce 
             this policy.<br>
             3. Using Anonymous is not allowed. Anonymous is considered hiding 
             your guild for ill behaviour and hides your existence from the guild 
             roster as well. Please use roleplay if you want to go anonymous. <b><br>
             4. Do not beg for Money, Equipment, Power Leveling, or ask to be twinked. 
             Power Leveling, begging, and rude behavior are not allowed or approved 
             by Guardians of Truth, and will result in intervention by the officers 
             (i.e. you WILL be kicked out). </b>There is nothing wrong with making 
             reasonable requests (a TP, CR or Rezz) but if no one can, then accept 
             they can't at that time. If no one responds to your request <b>do 
             not beg or spam the guild chat channel. </b><br>
             5. If someone in the guild gives you an item or items, DO NOT sell 
             them. If you are no longer going to use them, offer them to a low 
             level character in the guild at no charge. <br>
             6. Respect the guild members, we are all here to enjoy our time on 
             the server. I'm sure we would all love to help you with every request, 
             but if the guild is busy, stop asking for the day. <br>
             7. Be polite and sociable with your guild mates. If a guild mate makes 
             a reasonable request, and you can help them, then do so.<br>
             8. Do not try to rip off your guild, If you get an item that is worth 
             300-500p offer it up to the guild for 300p or maybe even 200p. <br>
             9. If you are looking to accomplish something you can't do yourself, 
             please go to the <a href="http://communities.msn.com/EQGuardiansoftheTruth/messageboard.msnw" target="_blank">forum 
             and post a request</a> or talk to an officer in-game. The guild will 
             try to organize some help for you. <br>
             10. Any in-game problems or disputes will be decided by officers. 
             Every officer has the power to remove players from the guild and will 
             do so without hesitation for breaking the rules. All officers sit 
             on a council that meets once a month to decide new guild policies.<br>
             11. All officers will anounce their arrival on line, as has been standard 
             for some time already.<br>
             12. Officers will hold a meeting at the end of each month, on the 
             last Sunday 12.00 PST on the chat, to discuss any and all Guild related 
             issues. <br>
             <b>And finally and most importantly,</b><br>
             <b>13. Have fun, it's just a game. Remember that and don't stress.</b>

             <p align="left">1. All raids must be announced at least one week in 
               advance to give people enough time to sign up and coordinate plans. 
               Raids will be announced on forum, on website and in forum calendar.<br>
               2. Everyone shall sign up to raid ahead of time if you want to go. 
               If you do not hear about the raid in time to sign up, you MUST be 
               at raid location on time. <br>
               3. If you're late, you are responsible for getting there on your 
               own. If a spot is available, you can have it. Don't expect a spot 
               to be ready for you.<br>
               4. Everyone must be at raid at least 15 min ahead of time. If you 
               have a long trip or TP, please make it before hand and be ready 
               to be on time. Raid leaders are encouraged to set up a meeting spot 
               near a TP point.<br>
               5. The host of the raid makes the groups, and his/her decision is 
               final.<br>
               6. Groups are assigned objectives (camps, etc... ) by the host.<br>
               7. All groups have to coordinate. Group leaders have to stay in 
               contact with the raid organizer at all times and groups have to 
               go where organizer tells them to. In many cases, we are in dangerous 
               places where there is no room for error. The guild channel will 
               be used by group leaders and raid leader to communicate. OOC or 
               shout will be used to communicate between group. Group talk will 
               be used within a group.<br>
               8. All members of a group have to obey and follow the group leader, 
               who is in contact with the organizer, in order to support other 
               groups properly.<br>
               9. Raid organizers are strongly encouraged to have a meeting with 
               all group leaders before the raid to outline strategy and assign 
               tasks.<br>
               10. Any member who does not abide by the final decisions of the 
               host will be kicked out of the raid with no regrets.<br>
               11. You must notify raid leader of any particular loot or quest 
               items that you need prior to raid so plans can be made. If an object 
               is found during the raid that was not asked for, all participants 
               of raid will be given a chance to claim it, based on greatest need. 
               If two or more people want an item, it will be rolled for. The raid 
               leader's decision is final and will be based on need before greed.<br>
