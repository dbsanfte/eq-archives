        going with auild is another guild, will probably be House of Isildur, Coinfist, or Carpe Noctern. &nbsp;Although the latter guild is full of roleplayers. <br> <br>I know we have some players with characters in other guilds. &nbsp;I know for sure we have some people with other characters in Doves of Truth and Progeny of Reliance. &nbsp;If you know of any others brings it to Darla / Michealas attention. &nbsp;Any help or input is greatly appreciated.

        well I can say, &nbsp;Carpe Noctem wont be our best bet, &nbsp;neither will Dead of Winter, &nbsp;as most of you know, &nbsp;I have a Necro in undead Legion, so they, and a few other guilds, &nbsp;might let us tag along, &nbsp;I am working on going to Hate with Legends, &nbsp;I have a few friends in there. &nbsp;will keep ya posted.. <br> <br>Mastenn Darezzinmann
