LET IT SLIDE - No Use For A Name
================

VERSE:
E
I spend a day or night
B
Then finally realize
C#                           G#
There’s really nothing going on
A                                 E
So why should i try to shake leaves
                           B
When there’s no one in my tree
                    C#  F#
That i should care about

CHORUS:
A             E
Let it fall, let it rise
C#            F#
Let it be and let it slide
B
Let tomorrow come
A                  E
And take my time away

VERSE 2:
I see the world get by
And watch my friends get high
I really don’t care who’s to blame
They love to point fingers at you
‘cause there’s nothing else to do
but waste away my time

CHORUS 

G#  A
    let tomorrow come
B                E   G# F# E
and take my time away
