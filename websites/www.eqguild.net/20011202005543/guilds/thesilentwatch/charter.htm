 <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#808040"><big>- Behavior -<br>
 <br>
 <em>Be civil to all members of TSW and all other people you come into contact with.</em><br>
 </big></font></p>

 <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#808040"><big>- What TSW expects from you -<br>
 <br>
 <em>Turn up for raids, not all, not compulsary, but some (eg epic) you must attend if your
 online. It would be appreciated if you could attend as many as possible while you are
 online. While on a raid, listen to the raid leader and pullers, and follow their
 instructions.</em><br>
 </big></font></p>
 
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#808040"><big>&nbsp;</big></font></p>
 
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#808040"><big>- Have Patience -<br>
 <br>
 <em>If you require help with an epic mob or help getting an item, think on we have over 80
 people in this guild, the majority of which are 50+ so some patience is going to have to
 be given as not just you will want something done. The more people you help, the more
 chance you have of those poeple helping you in return.</em><br>
 </big></font></p>
 
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#808040"><big>&nbsp;</big></font></p>
 
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#808040"><big>- Use of guildchat -<br>
 <br>
 <em>We keep guildchat open minded, but it is not a channel for moaning about loot. During
 guild events, /gu will be kept to a minimum.<br>
 </em></big></font></p>
 
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#808040"><big>&nbsp;</big></font></p>
 
 <p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#808040"><big>- Loot -<br>
 <br>
 <em>The majority of loot is handed out using an 'Award' system, to benefit the guild as a
 whole, not the individual. This system is used on guild 'raids' (raid is defined as &gt;2
 groups aiming for one goal). The awarding will be decided based on dedication, attendance,
 current gear to an extent and general contribution to the guild. Certain items will be
 exempt from this - rare one off items my be lottoed among all who can use or a fixed
 number, all depending on item and situation. Handing down items will NOT be mandatory -
 however, if you win a droppable item on a guild raid, it would be appreciated if you
 handed it down to someone who could benefit from it.</em></big></font></p>
