     This is a working progress overview of the Floors in TOFS<br><br>
     
     Tower of Frozne shadows needs at least one person in each group to have a key to go up the next level. Mirrors exit you outside of the tower, JUST outside of the tower, where Dervs are waiting for you. So don't wait till the last minute to zone.<br><br>
     
     Level 1<br>
     Keyholder: A Large Undead Gnoll<br>
     Loot: Nada (Faded Stuff that sells like FS)<br><br>
     
     This Floor is frictionless in the middle and has a pit to fall in. Don't worry theres just 6 skeletons in the pit so your group should have little trouble resueing you. The keyholder spawns at the entrance randomly as you kill everything in the area. Levitate is convent for those who are clumbsy.<br><br>
     
     The exit is the mirror at start point<br><br> 
     
     
     Level 2<br>
     Keyholder: Enraged Libarian<br>
     Loot:<br> 
     Students Homework +3 int +10 vs magic +15 Mana Range Slot(Common)<br><br> 
     
     Teachers Sylibus +3 wis +3 int +20 vs poison +20 mana Range Slot (RARE)<br><br>
     
     This is the first good loot room. Filled with Ghost that are various caster types. The Enraged Libarian spawns when enough are killed. He always drops one of the two drops. The teacher on this floor occasionaly drops one also.<br><br>
     
     
     The mirror is all the way to the back, turn left. The last bookshelf on the right is a door. The mirror is behind it.<br><br>
     
     Level 3<br>
     Keyholder: Enraged Shadow Beast<br>
     Loot:<br>
     Finely Crafted Velium Ring ac2 +3 sta +3 Agi +8 FR +15HP<br>
     Chilled Scythe 23/48 +4 str +4dex +20 vs cold Eff Shock of frost War,SK,necro<br><br>
     
     This is the first floor that has wandering mobs. However their very thin and I've walked through it before without fighting anything. I've always found the keyholder just left of the 
     start point.<br><br>
     
     The Mirror out from start is, Follor the hall right to the kitchen, turn left before the kitchen. 2nd(?) openeing on your right is a dining room. Go in and first left to the bedroom. The mirror is right there.<br><br>
     
     Level 4<br>
     Keyholder Cara Placeholder Amontehepna (zombie)<br>
     Loot:<br>
     Emalmers Skinning Knife (summons bandaids)<br>
     
     Sorcerers bow +7 Wis +7 Int -5 Cha +5 MR +5 FR +5 CR+50HP<br><br>
     
     Frost Covered tome +3 str +3 sta +15 FR +30 Mana secondary/RANGE RNG PAL SK War<br><br>
     
     Magnetic Dirk 8/23 +4 Str +10 Dex +5 MR primary effect True North (its a proc)<br><br>
     
     Shield of Shadows AC 15 +6 Int +20 mana +12 MR SK<br><br>
     
     Make SURE your FM and ready before coming into this floor. You will be attacked on zone in. Its common to have 2-5 mobs when you enter. Back the casters out of the hall and use your assist here.<br> 
     There are also pits, but if you follow someone who knows the route it should not be an issue. IF you fall, look for a torch and click on it. That will bring you to the begining of the floor.<br><br>
     
     The mirror out is behind a locked door you can open with the same key you came in with. the door is to the right as you come in. It goes down a long hall full of various mobs.<br><br>
     
     
     5th Floor The wedding<br>
     Keyholder : enraged Relative (First semi bad mob)<br>
     Loot:<br>
     Cemonial Wedding Sword Not a weapon +5 str +3 sta +3 Agi +3 Dex +6 MR<br><br> 
     
     Runed Etched Wedding band AC2 +3 str +4 Sta +6 Agi +8 Vs poison +8 vs Disease +15 HP<br><br>
     
     Laced viel AC2 +3 AGI +4 Dex +8 CHA +5 FR +8 vs Disease<br><br>
     
     Diamond Wedding band AC 2 +3 dex +5 Wis +5 Int +15 Mana +8 FR +8 CR<br><br>
     
     Velium Spiked helm AC10 +5 Str +5 Cha +5 vs everything +20 mana RNG CLR PAL SK BRD ROG WAR<br><br>
     
     Beer Stained Codain Tunic AC 12 +5 STR +5 MR CR PR +15 HP small races<br><br>
     
     
     This is most peoples favorite floor. There are multiple drops here, and you get to crash a wedding too. Only real concern is that any mob can spawn the enraged Relative on death, so multi pulling is bad. Also don't let your casters go OOM in case he spawns on you.<br><br>
     The mirror out is to the right as you come to the start point<br><br>
     
     
     6th Floor <br>
     Keyholder:VhalSera<br>
     Loot: <br>
     Abram's Axe/Maul of the Stotic 30/48 2HS AC 5 Sta+15 +5 MR CR FR effect invigor (proc)<br>
     
     Earring ac 2 5 str something else All/All <br><br>
     
     This is where it gets a little harder. You will need to pull several blue mobs out of the way as you progress. VhalSera is behind a mirror that doesn't need a key. He is accompanied by several green bats. The bats should me mezed and taken Singly because they spawn enraged Vampires. A much tougher mob. VhalSera charms so have MR up. He's fairly easy ones you block his ablitly to harm you though spells.<br><br>
     
     Exit: This is probably the nastiest exit to reach. I HIGHLY advise evac or gating. From the start point, go strait to the end then left. The statue in the room you are facing is a very nasty AOE trap. Run around it as much as possible to the room next to it. There is your exit.<br><br>
     
     Floor 8<br>
     Keyholder: Tserra lvl 51ish<br>
     Loot:<br>
     Tssera's Staff 2HB +5 Dex +10 int +6 Cha +8 vs poison +8 vs Disease +15 HP +55 mana<br><br>
     
     Tserra's Robe 8AC +6 Int +3 cha +10 vs Magic +5 vs Cold +10 Hp +50 Mana<br><br>
     
     Tserra's whip 7/22 +5 str +4 Agi +8 Dex Eff Muscle Lock Primary Slot<br><br>
     
     Harnessed Soul gem +6 int +35 Mana Eff Reclaim Energy mage only secondary slot.<br><br>
     
     Tserra's Symbol AC3 +5 wis +5 Int +5 CHA +40 Mana Neck slot<br><br>
     
     This is a very very cool floor, Complete with Familiars, torches, and trap banisters (hit for around 100). Pretty simple to head in and clear as you go. You will need to stop short and clear ALOT of Torches (they come off the wall and attack). Their spawn rate is very fast and there are alot so be ready for a workout. Clear a side and move down, make sure you clear alot of room as the aggro seems fairly large. Work your way to the banister on the far side. There is a hallway behind it. It will be very tight here, shrink is advised. there are 3(?) rooms in the hallway. a bat in each. Any bat can spawn Tserra.<br><br>
     Tserra herself is a handfull and does charm. A strong disciplined group of 50 can take her. Last time I took her she droped a tailsman and a mage only gem. both had very good stats.<br><br>
     
     The exit is up the stairs in the middle of the room with torches. You can't get lost on this floor.<br><br>
     
     
     Hope this guide was of some help to those wanting to visit TOFS.<br><br>
