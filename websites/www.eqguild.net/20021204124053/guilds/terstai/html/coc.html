This Code of Conduct is a list of Rules that every member of the Lords of the Ters'tai must obey to remain a member of this guild. This applies to everyone, from the High Lord/Lady down to the newest page. Obviously, you are not legally bound to follow these rules as in real life, but we will enforce them in the world of Everquest, and if you wish to remain a member of Lords, you should treat them as if they <B>ARE</B> laws . . . . because we will.
<P>
Above all else, we are an Honorable guild, and you should <B>ALWAYS</B> conduct yourself with this in mind.
<P>
<B><U>Punishment for Offences</U></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Lords enforces the rules below on a <I><B>"three strikes, your out"</B></I> policy. If an officer sees you, you are reported to an officer by a member or another person of good character for breaking these rules. You will be contacted by an officer, or an appointed Judicial Lord, and questioned about the complaint. The Judicial Lord will then bring his findings and conclusions before the High Council to be voted on and guilt or innocence determined.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>First Offence:</B> If you are found guilty, you will be given a verbal warning, and you will be placed on a <B>Watch List</B>. If you are placed on this list, you will remain on it for 7 real life days. If you are not found guilty of a second offence while on this list, at the end of the 7 days your name will be removed and you will have a clean slate.
<LI><B>Second Offence:</B> If you are found guilty, you will be given another warning, and placed on <B>Probation</B>. If you are placed on this list, you will remain on it for 15 real life days. If you are not found guilty of a third offence while on this list, at the end of the 15 days your name will be removed and you will have a clean slate.
<LI><B>Third Offence:</B> If you are found guilty of a third offence you will be removed from the guild and placed on a <B>Black List</B>. When you are placed on this list you will remain on it permanently.
</UL>
<P>
When you are placed on any of the afore mentioned lists, all of your characters that are in Lords will be placed on that list, so don't think that by switching to an alternate character, you can get around the rules.
<P>
If you are found guilty of an infraction that includes loss of property or monies ingame you will also be required to make restitution to the offended party, be it a single character, a group of characters, or a guild. If you do not make the restitution, you will be removed from the guild and placed on the Black List.
<P>
If it involves loss of property or monies of a Real Life nature, we will forward our findings to the appropriate authority, ie. a GM, and will wait for their ruling on the matter. If you are found guilty by the real life authority, the <B><I>"three strikes"</I></B> rule will not apply and you will be removed from Lords and placed on the <B>Black List</B>.
<P>
The <B>Black List</B> will be posted in The Great Hall forum so that members of Lords will know who you are and not attempt to sponsor you. All lists will be posted in The Council of Lords forum.
<P>
And we are not Verant/Sony, if a log was made of a conversation, and we determine that it isn't fraudulent, it <B>WILL</B> be used as evidence. If this log is determined to be fraudulent, we will prosecute the person that gave it to us under the "Dishonesty" rule.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL type="1">
<LI>You will not at any time be abusive or inconsiderate of another individual in the Everquest world.
<P>
<LI>You will show courtesy and respect to any Officer or Elder of this guild, the officers are here to serve you, and you should at least be respectful of their service to the guild, even if you do not like the person behind the character. The Elders should be shown respect for their prior service to this guild.
<P>
<LI>You will not at any time use inappropriate language in <B>ANY</B> chat channel. Inappropriate is defined as profanity, berating, abusive, any words or emotes of a sexually explicit nature, or any other socially unacceptable language. (and no, don't give us that line about “there's a profanity filter, use it”, that's no excuse for you to be rude or obnoxious)
<P>
<LI>You may never carry on an argument in /guildsay, if you and another must argue, take it to /tells, or if more than 2 people are involved, make a channel and take it there.
<P>
<LI>You will not at any time <B>Kill Steal</B> from another character. Kill Stealing is defined as attacking a “mob” that another character has engaged already, and causing sufficient damage that you take the kill from that character. If they use /yell or call for help, this will not be considered Kill Stealing no matter if you take the kill or not.
<P>
<LI>You will not intentionally <B>Train</B> another character. We know that a train is unavoidable in some circumstances, but you will at least attempt to give a warning if this is the case. If you are trained or otherwise put at risk by someone else, that is not an excuse to reply in kind.
<P>
<LI>You should always try to answer a /yell or call for help. This is also at your discretion, we do not ask that you jump in a fight that you obviously cannot change the outcome. We also do not ask you to jump in a fight that may ruin your reputation (faction) with a group of NPCs. (Ie. It's wrong to expect a Dark Elf to jump into a fight against the guards of the city of Neriak.)
<P>
<LI>You will not commit a theft against another character, group of characters, or a guild. This includes, but is not limited to, fraud, scams, “ninja looting” and extortion.
<P>
<LI>You will not be dishonest. This includes, but is not limited to, lying, fraud, scams, and any misrepresentation that can be construed as dishonest behavior.
<P>
<LI>You will not cheat. This includes, but is not limited to, any bug that allows you to obtain monies or items that you have not earned or are entitled to, the use of any third party software that Sony/VI has not approved for use in Everquest or the use of any exploit to obtain experience or loot that you are not actually earning.
<P>
<LI>Do not threaten another guild with a guild war. Lords does not and will never participate in a Guild War. If you have a problem with members of another guild, take it up with a Lords Officer, or the offending characters Guild Officers. Sometimes we will tell you it is between the two of you and to settle your own differences, if you wish to duel them in one on one combat, that's your business.
<P>
<LI>Do not asked to be power-leveled or offer to power-level others in /guildsay. While we do not object to power-leveling, it does not mean we or any member wishes to be subjected to it, or hear someone whining about. If you must power-level, or be power-leveled, we suggest you ask a friend in /tell, or use some other means.
<P>
<LI>You will not break any Raid Rules set by a designated Lords Raid Leader, or as stated in the posted <A HREF="raidrules.html"><B>Raid Rules</B></A> (when they become available). When a conflict of Raid Leader rules and posted rules occurs when on a Lords of the Ters'Tai raid, posted rules will take priority.
<P>
<LI>All members are required to have an account with Guild Magic. All of their characters that are members of LoTT must be submitted to the Lords of the Ters'Tai list on Guild Magic.
<UL type="disc">
<LI>When a character is paged into the Lords of the Ters'Tai, before they will be voted on they must be on our Guild Magic list.
<LI>After they are on the list, they must keep their character updated regularly. After December 1, 2002, any character on that list that has not been updated within 3 months of the current date will be removed from the list. After they have been removed from the list, they will be in breach of the Guild Magic rule, and subject to being removed from the guild. You will be warned at the first opportunity, and then removed from the guild the next time you are seen unless you have resubmitted your character to the listing on Guild Magic.
</UL>
</OL>
<P>
Above all else, if an Officer of the Council “suggests” that you stop doing something, change the way you are acting or do something you have been asked to do, don't argue or talk back to them. Take it for granted that they are giving you a free warning, and that if you keep doing whatever it is that prompted them to speak with you, the next warning will be an official one, and subject to review by an appointed Judicial Lord.

<P>
<B><U>Non-Punishable Minor Rules of Conduct</U></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Always ask for permission before you “inspect” someone, it is good manners. You should be considerate of others feelings on this, and it only takes a few seconds to ask for permission. (No, the rest of us don't want to hear you discuss this in /guildsay either, so just do it and leave it at that.)
<P>
Always make an active attempt to attend any guild function or meetings. While you will not be punished for not attending, we do note who shows up always and who is chronically absent. Obviously, real life comes first, so if a real life situation arises, please let us know you can't attend.
<P>
Always try to be helpful when possible. If someone asks a question in /guildsay, don't make a snide comment (which if bad enough, can actually be punishable), if you know the answer, please answer the question courteously.
<P>
Don't spam /guildsay with one-sided, or 2 person conversations. It's a good communication medium, and we do like to see our members not be shy and talk, but don't abuse it please.
<P>
Don't spam /guildsay with a minute-by-minute, blow-by-blow account of what you are doing. If you want to write a story about your adventures, that's what the Library Forum is there for. Use it.

<B><U>Definitions of Guild Property</U></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Treasury</B> – Tradable Items and all monies won on Raids, or donated to the guild, will be stored here. Any item or money given to you by the Guild Treasury will be considered a <B>LOAN</B>, and is expected to be returned. If it is not returned when you are asked, this will be considered a theft of guild property and you will be removed from Lords and placed on the <B>Black List</B>. This obviously does not include spells or items Multiquested to you. It also does not include items won in rolls during raids, or items or money that the Treasurer specifically states is not a loan.
<P>
<B>Cleric/Caster Fund</B> – This will hold any gems normally used by clerics and pure casters excluding those spells that are self only, and an amount of cash determined by the treasurer to be sufficient to cover gem expenses for Raids. Gems used by clerics and/or pure casters on guild Raids will be replaced or the they will be reimbursed from raid loot and/or this fund. Although we cannot possibly always keep count of what the cleric/pure caster has used, sometimes we will watch and count, please don't try to “get over” on us, if you are caught attempting to “milk” this fund, it will be considered a theft of guilt property, and punished as stated above. Any gems used for self only buffs will not be covered by this Fund.
<P>
<B>Gem Vault</B> – Quest Gems and Gems used to make high level resist gear are stored here. Any gems that are given out by the Treasurer are no longer the property of the guild when traded to the character needing them. But it would be appreciated if you replaced or paid for those gems when you are able to do so.
<P>
<B>Spell Vault</B> – Spells that are not lottoed on raids, or are donated to the guild will be stored here. If you are within 1 level of needing a spell that is here, you may ask for it. As with Gems, once transferred, spells are no longer guild property, but we do ask that you try to replace it with a comparable spell, or the same spell if you obtain it in the future.
<P>
<B>Multi-Questable Items</B> – Any multiquestable item that is determined to be guild property by the Raid Rules, or a Lords Raid Leader, will be under the control of the Treasury and will be made available to members of the guild at a vastly reduced price determined by the High Council, the proceeds to be placed in the Treasury.
