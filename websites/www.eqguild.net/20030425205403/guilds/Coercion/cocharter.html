  Coercion will be a high end guild located on KB. We have dedicated and motivated 
  team members who all share one common goal, and that is the high end game. We are a raiding 
  guild. If you are a casual player, I am sure there will be guilds of that kind, this 
  however is not one of them.

  Coercion will be one of the first guilds on its home server of Kane Bayle, and counts among 
  its members many of the most well known players on the server. As a guild we strive to do, 
  well everything. It is our intent to do server firsts and we intend to keep it that way.

  </center>
  <p style="font-size: x-small">
  Above all we are looking for people who can play this game and their chosen class at a 
  level well above average. We want people who don't use the anonymity of the internet as an 
  excuse to act like jerks in the game. We want people we can depend on. And last but not by 
  any means least, we want people we like!</p>
