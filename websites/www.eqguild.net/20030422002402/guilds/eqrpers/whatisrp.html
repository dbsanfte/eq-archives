<span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font size="3">What does it mean to role-play?</font></span>
<p align="left">
<span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font size="2">Role-playing is building a character around a personality
you create. That personality may be anything your imagination allows. Your character may or may not be anything like you in
RL.</font></span>
</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font size="2">Role-playing
is a form of acting, without a script.  You play your character as you would a part in a
play.  And just like a character in a play, role-playing characters have
motivations, backgrounds and reasons for behaving and acting. Many role-players will often write a story about their character to
assist them with this process.</font> </span></p>
<p align="left">
<span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font size="2">Role-playing is more than clicking on stats and gaining gear to outfit your character. It's becoming a
fictional personality.</font></span></p>
<p align="left">
<span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font size="2">Role-playing is more than text chat
banter too, it's thinking like your character and acting on it in game.</font></span>
</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font size="2">Role-playing
is asking yourself, "What would my character do?"  rather than
doing what you would do.</font></span>
</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font size="2">Role-playing
is a way of thinking. It's not a matter of how well you speak like you're in a Shakespearian play. You don't have to be an expert,
have years of table-top D&D behind you, or even be a good typist. Think like
your character and the rest will come.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font size="2">Role-playing
is looking at your co-worker or buddy down the street, who plays the same nights
you do, and not seeing the guy behind the keyboard, but rather the character
persona he created.  </font></span></p>
<p align="left">
<span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font size="2">Role-playing is removing
yourself from the real world for short while and submerging yourself in a
fictional world.  Think of how characters in classic fantasy books or
movies behave.  Would King Arthur ask Mordrid to group?  Would Merlin ask Morgana for a
Resurrection?  Would the Fellowship in Lord of the Rings raid LothLorien for uber loot?  Would Frodo ask Elrond to
"twink" him?  Would Harry Potter ask for "Crack"? Would Conan the
Barbarian say "Dude, u kicked ass!"? Think about it.</font></span>
</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><font size="2">For those that
choose to role-play, it adds depth to a game that would otherwise be kill, loot, sell, buy, rinse and repeat.  And there are plenty of games like Quake and Diablo out there to cover that kind of play.</font></span>
