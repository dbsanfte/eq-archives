<p align="center"><font color="#006666">I am slowly trying to make this a new home for The Order of Antondwer, but it promising to be a slow process.  I will be slowly trying to move over everything from the old site, but I can't promise that it will work.  Time will tell : )</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#006666">In other news, we will be having a welcoming ceremony for new members Sat., the 21st of April, as well as that is the time I will be announcing the names of the people who are going to be running for Guild Council.

<p align="center"><font color="#006666">Uwei and Gwendilyn's wedding was wonderful, and there are a lot of stories that were written about it in the forums.  There is a picture sent in by Thorni that I will try to figure out how to get up here on the board soon, so all can see.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#006666">This Saturday, April 7th, we will be having a Guild Meeting at 3pm PST (4pm MST,5pm CST,6pm EST and 11pm GMT).  The plan is to have a Welcoming Ceremony for new members and the meeting in Rivervale, and after the meeting, a Guild Raid on Runnyeye.  If you are interested in raiding Runnyeye, please contact me (Talanye) in game, or through e-mail <a href="mailto:Talanye@eqguild.net">Talanye@eqguild.net.</a></b></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#006666">Topics for the meeting will include elections, what positions will be open, and what is needed in order to be able to run for the spots, when the elections will be, and any other topics that are brought to my attention.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#006666">This past Saturday we had the Scavenger
Hunt. It turned out even better then I had hoped it would, and it seems a fun
time was had by all. Thank you everyone who was involved in making it so
successful.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#006666">This Saturday, the 24th, is Uwei and
Gwendilyn's wedding. It will be on top of the Stone Bridge to South Karana at
11pm GMT (which is 6pm EST, 5pm CST, 4pm MST and 3pm PST) If anyone needs help
getting to the location, please let someone know, such as Uwei, Gwendilyn, or
myself (Talanye), so we can plan for extra time helping you get to the location.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#006666">I am hoping to get the Guild Rules up
soon, and also the Recruitment Form working, as some people seem to be having
difficulty with it. If you are having troubles sending the form, and wish to see
about joining the Order of Antondwer, please feel free to either post on the
forums the information so we can get hold of you (e-mail or in game), or send me
an e-mail at <a href="mailto:Talanye@eqguild.net">Talanye@eqguild.net</a></b></font></p>
