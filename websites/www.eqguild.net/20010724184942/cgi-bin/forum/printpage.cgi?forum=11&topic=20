        Howdy~ <br>I'll be back in Mistmoore on Saturday, late-afternoonish and hopefully with a few guildies to drink with... anyone want to come out and join us? We can start up a group (or two) have a few shots of my nasty vodka and generally wreak havok on the local wildlife... This ought to be fun~ of all the things i wreak, havoc generally has the best fun factor. <br>... cuz, ya know... wreaking pickles upon the enemy only tends to feed them pickles. <br>okay, bye (Anna)
