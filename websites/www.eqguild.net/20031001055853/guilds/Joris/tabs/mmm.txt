(Intro:)

Em  Bm  Em  Bm  F  G  F  G 

Am   G                 C   C
Once    there was this kid who
F           C            G#               C
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
    F    F          G    C
But when he finally came back
G   C    F               C          G        G      G
His hair had turned from black into bright white
   G#               C        
He said that it was from when
    G#               Cmaj7/F Cmaj7/F     F       F
The cars had smashed soooo               hard          

Em        Bm         Em        Bm           F    G    F    G
Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm, Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm
Em        Bm         Em        Bm           F    G    F    G
Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm, Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm

Am   G                C    C
Then   there was this girl who
F              C               G#           C
Wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room
    F    C              G    C  
But when   they finally made her
G    C    F                C        G       G   G
They saw    birthmarks all over her body
    G#               C
She couldn't quite explain it
       G#          Cmaj7/F Cmaj7/F   F      F
They'd always just been              there

Mmmm ...

Dm   Dm       C    G       G
Both girl and boy were glad
Dm  Dm         C      G             F          G
One kid had it worse than that

       Am   G             C   C
'Cause then   there was a boy whose
F                C                 G#           C
Parents made him come right home directly after school
    F    C            G     C
And when they went to their church
G    C     F                 C        G             G   G
They shook   and lurched all over the church floor
   G#               C
He couldn't quite explain it
       G#          Cmaj7/F Cmaj7/F     F       F
They'd always just gone                there
