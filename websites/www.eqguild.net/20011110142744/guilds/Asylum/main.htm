<p align="center"><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="6">Welcome to the halls of the <i>Arcane
Asylum</i>.</font></b></p>
<p><font size="4">     The Arcane Asylum was founded by
Surien Stormsong and Melechor with the goal of bringing unity to all classes and
races.  Through our experiences as a guild, we hope to create a peaceful
forum for teaching and learning how to work together in battle to form a
cohesive and effective fighting force.  Specifically--combine the power of
the casters and the might of the warrior classes--and watch the bad guys fall! </font></p>
<p><font size="4">     An often heard disagreement concerns
the place and function of each class working in a group; in other words, what
should the caster be doing and what should the warrior be doing?  What
spells should or shouldn't a caster cast at a certain time?  At what point
should a cleric or healer stop trying to heal people and join in the
fight?  When should a warrior pull a mob?  These questions are
endlessly debated in groups, adding undue stress to the battlefield.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">     Surien laments, "I have been in
groups where I wish I could have sent a blast right up my group members' rear
ends and ditched them.  I have also been in groups where everyone seemed to
work so well together it was like magic in itself.  We become a powerful
fighting force when there is a unity of minds.  I want this guild to learn
and to teach ways of accomplishing this unity, this magic."</font></p>
<p><font size="4">With these lofty goals in mind, here are but a few of the
Arcane Asylum's ideals:</font></p>
<p><font size="5"><b>Guild Conduct:     </b></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Arcane Asylum is NOT a warring guild.  Guild wars cause
too much hostility both within the guild and among the various guilds in
EverQuest: This goes against our goals.  Members of this guild are expected
to act in a kindly and helpful manner whenever possible; however, not to the
expense of themselves or the guild.  Defending the honor of the guild
against hostile outsiders is more than expected, it is a necessity, barring the
declaration of guild wars.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">     Arcane Asylum does not believe in a
free-ride for ourselves or our guild members.  Charity is freely given when
members feel moved to do so -- we don't give handouts.  Our guild members
grow through experience, not through begging.</font></p>
<p><font size="5"><b>Character Development:  </b></font></p>
<p><font size="4">It is the hopes of this guild that we become self-sufficient,
not only as efficient casters and warriors, but also as tailors, blacksmiths and
the like.  To be well-rounded characters, we must develop skills which set
us apart from the others.</font></p>
