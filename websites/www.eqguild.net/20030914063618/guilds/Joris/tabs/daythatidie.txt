"The Day That I Die"

INTRO: A E D A
       A E D A 

A  		       E
 One day I woke up, I woke up knowing
   D                     A
Today is the day I will die
A                         E                
 Cashdogg was barking Went to the park and 
   D                  A
enjoyed it one last time
C#m   
 I called my mother, told her I loved her
       D
And I begged her not to cry
A                    E
 I wrote a letter, I said I'd miss her
    D                  A
And I signed that Goodbye

CHORUS:
              E                  Bm
You know the happiest day of my life
             E                  D -stop-
I swear the happiest day of my life
NC
Is the day that I die
A                 E
Can you feel the cold tonight (the day that I die)
D               A
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I die)
     A                   E
The darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I die)
D             D
All alone but I feel fine

VERSE:
We took a drive and we drove to D.C.
To see the places we live
Our conversations we talked of old friends
And all the things that we did
 C#m
Summer nights, Drunken fights
    D
Mistakes we made, Did we live it right

[Chorus:]
You know the happiest day of my life
I swear the happiest day of my life
Is the day that I die
Can you feel the cold tonight (the day that I die)
It sets in, but it's alright (the day that I die)
The darkness falls, I'm letting go (the day that I die)
All alone but I feel just fine

A E D A
A E D D

nog een keer Chorus

Did I live it right, I hope I lived it right (the day that I die) 3X
