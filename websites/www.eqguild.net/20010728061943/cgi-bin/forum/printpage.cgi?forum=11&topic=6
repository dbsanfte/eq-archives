        Anybody in ? <br> <br>Ooooohh this looks cosy.... Hmmm now where can I put my feet up.. It's been a long hard day and my feet are barking terribly ! <br> <br>Oooh talking of dogs, can I hear howling ? <br> <br>Awwww poor things they must be hungry !... Let me see if I can find a few cookies and elven to share out. <br> <br>*opens her backpack and looks inside* <br> <br>Ooh yes more than enough to share around. <br> <br>*sits down by the fire and warms herself* <br> <br>*Opens a bottle of elven and makes herself comfy.  After a while she nods off to sleep exhausted*

        *opens her eyes and smiles to her friends* <br> <br>Ooohhh I am so sorry I dosed off there. Please forgive my rudeness.. It's just so cosy in here by the fire and all. <br> <br>I was just thinking of a little poem then and dosed off. Hmmm now how did it go ? <br> <br>*ponders whilst she polishes her nails* <br> <br>Ohhh but what am I saying ! ! ! <br> <br>Please sit down.. Have some wine and cookies if you will.  I have plenty here and it's far better to eat and drink in lovely company. <br> <br>And if you have some friends nearby, please invite them as well !! <br> <br>Now what am I saying ? *Blushes beyond all comprehension* ... This is your abode and I sound like I have taken over the place ! <br> <br>I am so so sorry, I really didn't mean to be so rude :( <br> <br>*Sits down quietly and takes another sip of wine* <br> <br>As for inticing me into your fold, Hmmmm let me see now.  I cannot leave my present family but I may have a friendly magician that might like to join your ranks. I have a question to ask though ? <br> <br>Does she have to have furry feet and howl at the moon each night.  I am not sure she has put any time in with her guildmaster in that field of work. <br> <br>But I will ask her.  As for the furry feet, I think I can rustle up a pair of gnollhide shoes for gnollies are far better to be under our feet than to stand up alive *smirks* <br> <br>Ohh and hello Opalcat.. I am sorry I didn't introduce myself.  I met dear Lilla a long way back in the lair of spiltpaw.  We were hunting gnolls and I think if I remember correctly she was battering them with a book for being late on returning it to the library on time if I recall. <br> <br>Lovely to see you my friend. <br> <br>*Hugs them both and sits down again* <br> <br>Hmmmm the Wolfden.. I feel a poem coming on soon :) <br> <br>edit... hehe forth word a typo.. Can't have that now can we ! *Laughs* <br> <br>(Edited by Nenya deVichier at 5:01 am on Mar. 25, 2001)

        *chuckling* &nbsp;Well, Nenya, actually...that gnoll you saw me with....he was paying me to beat him...*shakes head and blushes slightly* &nbsp;Some people and their kinks. &nbsp;The world may never know what drives them...*laughs and pours herself a drink* <br> <br>As for your magician friend...I suppose this menacing mage you speak of &nbsp;wouldn't be required to bay at the moon, but it wouldn't hurt to fake it..(I can teach her how to do that) &nbsp;*takes a sip of wine and smiles delightedly) &nbsp;The hairy feet? &nbsp;Gnoll hide would be good as long as you never took them off. &nbsp;We could pretend you...erm the mage.. was just normal underneath the boots...hehe <br> <br>Can't wait to read your poem! &nbsp;You've always been so talented! &nbsp;(and amazingly grammatically correct -- you should teach me that sometime..hehe) <br> <br>Nenya, we need to get together and group up sometime...it's been way too long since we've been in the same parts of the world at the same time! &nbsp;hehe <br> <br>*hug* <br> <br>We'll have to find some time to eat cookies and drink some milk in game soon...(ah, hell, milk is too hard to find ;) so we'll just get liquor)  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
