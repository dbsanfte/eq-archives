        We're creating Iksars on The Rathe for the heck of it. &nbsp;All those who want to participate are welcome, obviously, but you should hurry up if you want to level-match with the rest of us! <br> <br>Once you have your Iksar, post here with info. <br> <br>Me: &nbsp; Grebekka, currently a very powerful level 2 *cough* shaman <br>

        Ah yes...in my formative years, I traveled the lands of Kunark alone. &nbsp;while there, I was taken captive by the Iksar government and held hostage. &nbsp; At first, I was alone in my cell. &nbsp;I longed for the companionship of others. &nbsp;When they placed some froglok slaves in the cell with me, at first I was ecstatic. &nbsp;I would finally have someone to talk to. &nbsp;Let me tell you, the frogloks, even in slavery, are a very sullen group. &nbsp;I found that they still held some resentment towards me based on rumors of my recent visits to Guk. &nbsp;They were not very fond of me at all. &nbsp; <br> <br>I was under constant attack. &nbsp;I had to sleep with one eye open just so I might make it through the next day. &nbsp;And although many people feel that all Iksars are evil, one lone Iksarian guard had a soft spot and took pity on me. &nbsp;He would let me out of my cell at night and teach me his language as well as the language of the frogloks. &nbsp;I had no idea at the time I would ever see my friends or family again. &nbsp;And so as night after night we stayed up talking into the wee hours of the morning before he had to return me to my cell so that no other Iksar might find out, we grew very close. <br> <br>I know the outside world may never understand....but my guild...my family...I must tell you something. <br> <br>I have a half-iksar daughter named Lillatoo. &nbsp;I left her under her father's care after he helped me escape by telling the Iksar government I had died during the birth and he had disposed of my body. &nbsp;The condition was that I was never to return to the city of Cabalis, for he could be killed were the government to ever learn the truth. <br> <br>I received a letter from him the other day informing me that Lillatoo has begun to study the way of the necromancers. &nbsp;Apparently, since she has believed me to be dead since her birth, she has taken an eerie interest in all things dead or dying. &nbsp;She's in her 3rd season, at the moment, and I hear she sometimes acts more like a woodelf rather than an Iksar but at least for her sake, she got her father's looks and is able to thrive only within the Iksar community. <br> <br>So please, if you're in Cabalis, look for Lillatoo, level 3 necromancer. &nbsp;But please don't tell her of me in your travels. <br>
