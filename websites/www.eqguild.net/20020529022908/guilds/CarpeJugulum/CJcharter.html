     Charter and Rules</font></i></b></div align=center>
 </h1>
 
 <div align=center>Charter</div align=center> 
 <p><br>
   (This is the exact charter that was submitted and accepted at the time of Guild 
   creation)<br>
   Carpe Jugulum is a small band of Norrathians who feel it is our duty to join 
   together and create the best environment, not only for ourselves, but for those 
   around us. We feel that in order to create this environment we need to be surrounded 
   by adventurers who will respect us, other adventurers, and the world around 
   them, as well as help us in time of need, regardless of class, race, or religious 
   affiliation. Above all, we feel the need to enjoy our adventures.</p>
 <p align="center">Application</p>
 <p align="left">Those interested in joining Carpe Jugulum may be guilded by any 
   officer entrusted with officership. In order to apply, one must group with an 
   officer (if a level appropriate officer is available). During this grouping 
   time, your style of adventuring will be evaluated, as well as your interaction 
   with those around you. Regular members should also recruit new members during 
   the course of normal adventuring. Every applicant will be responsible for reading 
   through and understanding the guild rules.</p>
 <p align="center">Conduct</p>
 <p align="left">All members of Carpe Jugulum will conduct themselves in a manner 
   befitting the reputation of the guild. This includes your style of adventuring, 
   as well as your interaction with others (regardless of whether or not they are 
   currently Carpe Jugulum members).</p>
 <p align="left">Actions that are frowned upon by Carpe Jugulum include, but are 
   not limited to:</p>
 <ol>
   <li>Excessive KSing. This means taking a mob that another adventurer has already 
     engaged. We all know KSing happens from time to time, and have probably done 
     it ourselves. If you KS something by accident, apologize. Try not to do it 
     again, thats all we ask.</li>
   <li>Camp Stealing. This means deliberatly engaging, or remaining in an area 
     that will cause you to be aggroed upon, a &quot;camped&quot; spawn. While 
     VI does not officially recognize campable spawns, the community in general, 
     and Carpe Jugulum, does.</li>
   <li>Training mobs on another adventurer. This means deliberately aggroing a 
     mob and running it to an adventurer in order that they be killed (different 
     from pulling in that pulling deaths are accidental). There is really no excuse 
     for this and simply will not be tolerated from Carpe Jugulum members.</li>
   <li>&quot;Ninja Looting&quot;. This means looting corpses excessively. Loot 
     on your turn, and always be fair. All adventurers are in need of platinum 
     to upgrade weapons, armor and spells, but understand that all should recieve 
     a fair share.</li>
   <li>Begging. This means atempting to recieve goods or services at no cost to 
     you. This specifically means armor, weapons, and money. To a lesser extent, 
     this also includes buffs and heals, when done to excess.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>If any adventurer feels that a member is acting in a manner not befiting Carpe 
   Jugulum, the matter will be fully investigated by the leader or those appointed 
   by the leader. The investigators will attpemt to mediate the matter, up to and 
   including removal of guild status of the offending party(s). No member, however, 
   shall have their guild status revoked without an officer vote, and approval 
   of removal by the leader. The offending party(s) will be placed on warning during 
   the time of the investigation and the officer vote, and will be allowed to plead 
   their case to the leader. The leader will then relay the member's arguments 
   (and bribe offers), explanations, etc to all officers.</p>
 <p align="center">Member List</p>
 <p align="left">A guild member lisst will be maintained and posted on the Guild 
   website. This list will include names of members (in no particular order), and 
   will be linked to a picture and profile of that member.</p>
 <p align="center">Officership</p>
 <p align="left">Officership will be granted to members of Carpe Jugulum whom the 
   leader feels have exhibited exemplary qualities as an adventurer. Officership 
   is in fact a responsibility, and is not to be taken lightly. Any member who 
   is offered an officer position may decline.</p>
 <p align="center">Raids</p>
 <p align="left">Raids. This is what every guild member looks forward to, whether 
   it is for the experience, the loot, or the simple joy of interacting with others 
   to accomplish a goal. Carpe Jugulum will attempt to design raid opportunities 
   to suit each level range of members. Carpe Jugulum believes in the Need Before 
   Greed policy on raids. This means that melees will not be allowed to roll on 
   caster only items, and vice versa. If none of the appropriate classes would 
   consider the items an upgrade, then all members will be allowed to roll on it. 
   If a member already has the item in question (obtained during the raid), they 
   will not be allowed to roll on that item until everyone has one. No drop items 
   will not be looted by any person who cannot use the item. If there are no raid 
   members who can use the item, the location will be /shout to the entire zone 
   so that a person who can use the item can have the chance to obtain it. The 
   coin loot will be gathered by the leaders of each raid group, and then 50% of 
   the total coin will be divided evenly amongst the participants at the conclusion 
   of the raid. The remainder will be deposited into the guild bank to be used 
   to cover the costs of future raids (reagents for casters, arrows for melees, 
   transportation costs, rezzes, etc). Any extra items that drop, once each raid 
   participant has one, will be placed into the guild bank for use by guild members 
   who find themselves in need. Any member who has an idea for a raid should post 
   on the guild message center. Please try to be a specific as possible when posting 
   a raid idea. During multiple guild raids, the leader will ensure that all Carpe 
   Jugulum members recieve a share of the profits, loot, etc, from the raid.</p>
 <p align="center">Guild bank/library</p>
 <p align="left">Carpe Jugulum has established a guild bank and library. The current 
   guild banker is Elazeel, who has absolutely no interest in furthering his adventures. 
   The guild banker/librarian is charged with holding all guild monies and extra 
   items including research materials. The guild monies are available for raids, 
   loans, and approved tradeskills (approved tradeskills are those which the guild 
   needs). The items in the guild bank will be given or loaned out at the discretion 
   of the guild leadership and officers. Items recieved from the guild bank may 
   not be sold, however, and should be returned to the guild banker when you have 
   finished with them (in the case of consumables, you should donate any left overs 
   that you may have).</p>
 <p align="left">This concludes the guild rules. These rules are subject to change 
   as Carpe Jugulum grows and evolves through time. Any changes will be posted 
   on the guild message center, and a guild message of the day will be displayed 
   in order that all members are kept appraised of changes.</p>
