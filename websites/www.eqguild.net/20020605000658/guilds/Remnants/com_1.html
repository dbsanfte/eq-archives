The City of Mist can be found in the Emerald Jungle this is a high level zone. It is similar to Solusek B in that it starts out upper 30ish and gets extremely high level in the back. Of special note is the fact that melee types can be bound here.<br><br>

Mobs that can be found here are generally golems and undead. There are quite a few items which are rare drops that can drop off any of the NPC's in this zone. The higher level areas can be found in the back of the dungeon through a locked door. I'm not positive but I believe the key is dropped by the Skeleton Captain who spawns in first courtyard.<br><br>

Past the locked door is where the dungeon begins to get serious. Black Reavers are level 51ish mobs and there is a Lord who spawns back there from time to time which is very high level. These drop very nice items and it is worth the effort.
<br><br>
Some items which can be found here include: Jade Reaver, Master Wu's Trance Stick and the Axe of Lost Souls.<br><br>

Gashain has submitted his step by step guide on venturing far into the City of Mist. This approach requires you having a large number of players. It is posted below:<br><br>

City of Mist Guide:<br><br>

G1 - Cleric, Druid, Tank, Monk, SK and Pet class<br>
G2 - Cleric, Druid, Tank, Tank, pet classes<br>
G3 - Mixed<br>
G4 - Mixed<br>
G5 - Mixed<br>

Step 1 - First group that arrives with the primary puller (Monk or SK) keeps the gate and the pond area cleaned waiting for the Captain of the Guard to spawn. The captain drops a no-rent Fine Steel Ulak, this is the supposed to be used for the key to the castle. Primary Puller loots all the items from the Captain.<br><br>

EDITORS NOTE: This is not neccessarily true. It is something that the editor himself admitted they could not figure out and it is something that we ourselves discovered last week. I believe that the Captain is supposed to drop a key but he never does or the key never works. It would make sense for the Ulak to be the key because it is no rent.<br><br>

There are two ways to get by without a key.<br><br>

1) Have someone pick the lock.<br>
2) Use a PBAE spell(such as the word of pain line) from outside of the door. This will aggro the reavers inside and the door will open as they run out.<br><br>

Step 2 - After group formation move to the left side in the back of the large main courtyard. Call this CoM level 1. Setup camp here. Bind tanks and Buff. (left side is better because the ramp out of the water is on this side)<br><br>

Step 3 - Begin cleaning the corner by pulling to the main group still in the courtyard. After the corner is cleaned do not move up. Begin cleaning the bridge area (gazebos). Monks need to be very careful here , it doesnt appear that you have many mobs to clean, but an entire mob of goos and what not are aggrod on the group and can't get there because of a path bug. FD'ing in the corner should work this out.<br><br>

Step 4 - The bridge is clean and no mobs aggro'd. Move to the corner.<br><br>

Step 5 - Begin Pulling the reavers from the castle. The castle has about 8 spawns with what I'm guessing are 3 reavers and about 5 phantoms or sorts. SK ae at the door and FD at the T in on the bridge, specified picker or FD'r piks one reaver and brings to the corner.<br><br>

Step 6 - Reavers can only be tanked by level 50's. Don't bother casting on them. Tanks back out when low. When first reaver is being worked on non tanks and healers classes are to provide the most important roll of keeping any extra mobs off the tanks and healers. After first reaver is dead, Dont relax another immediately spawns. Keep killing the reavers until a ghost or Lord of some sort spawns. Just like a Lord has to be tanked and man do they have some Hps. by this time the corner starts to respawn and support is critical. This is were it gets fun - everyone is low on mana and must work together.<br><br>

Step 7 - Keep pulling the reavers till the Main Lord spawns. This is the one that drops the key and the shield.<br><br>

Step 8 - At this point the castle should be clear of reavers. If so, move in quick. Take out the remaining 2 or 3 apparitions. If you wait to long reavers will respawn.<br><br>

Step 9 - Get out of the castle. Go thru the right door in the back of the room and take a right. Fight and clean roaming mobs in the small room at this corner. The long ramp leads up to the top of the city and to a small room with a host of goo's and what not that can't be sorted out of the room. Bum rush it.<br><br>

Step 10 - Clean this small room and setup camp here. Call this CoM level 2. Just prior to this small room is a secret door that leads you to a Misty ramp which climbs up and eventually takes you to 3 unique bldgs, call this CoM level 3. This invisible ramp also hovers over the top of the ground floor Courtyard (CoM level 1). From this misty ramp escape can be done by free falling to the courtyard. Note: if you die on the ramp you can corpse it from the courtyard.<br><br>

Step 11 - Clean CoM level 2, human skeleton can be accessed from here. Pull to the small room.<br><br>

Step 12 - Begin monk exploration up the misty ramp and to CoM level 3. Again, I'm guessing that the key dropped from the main lords spawned from reavers will open a locked door at this level. We havent made it this far - additional info would be great.<br><br>

Step 13 - DMG or Lev and move up to CoM level 3 when possible. Ultimate goal is the last building. there is a small gap you have to jump across to get to this building, in addition a trap floor in the final building that drops you all the way to the ground. No clue what is in CoM level 3, as far as I know , no guild on our server has attempted to go all the way.<br><br>

Step 14 - Celebrate Victory!<br><br>
