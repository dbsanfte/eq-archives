  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">1. Membership 
    Requirements:</font></b><font size="2"> Anyone interested in joining must 
    be at least level 20(level requirement may be lowered during special recruiting 
    sessions as determined by the guildleader). Player must be of a good and fair 
    demeanor. An officer shouldn't have to travel long distances out of their 
    way to go invite someone, a meeting place and time may be decided upon. There 
    are no level restrictions for an alt of a guild member interested in joining, 
    but they must have the name of their guild character at their disposal at 
    the time of membership request (Proof by logging in on their guild character 
    and responding may be required). Level requirement rules can be overridden 
    by the guildleader or a majority guild vote. </font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2. Member Conduct</b>: 
    Guild success is dependant upon a cooperative effort and requires active, 
    respectful and honorable participation by all members. Each person is responsible 
    for upholding The guild’s good reputation and name wherever he/she adventures. 
    Kill stealing, camp poaching, ninja looting, or any other kind of unethical 
    behavior will NOT be tolerated. If you are accused of any of these types of 
    behavior an officer will contact you for your version of what occured. The 
    officer may send a incident report to the guildleader.If the officer or guildleader 
    determines to his/her own satisfaction that you were involved in any of these 
    unsavory acts, you may be removed from the guild (a warning will be issued 
    for first occurance). Be mindful of language and content in guildchat and 
    public forums (i.e. shout's, ooc's, and say's). No abusive language or behavior 
    will be tolerated in any way. Your guild tag should be visible at all times. 
    We do understand the need for being anonymous at times. To be anonymous yet 
    still display the guild tag type in "/roleplay". Keep your member information 
    up to date. Check the web guildsite, update character information. and post 
    regularly so that you and fellow members are knowledgeable with event schedules, 
    general information, issues, etc. What you know is important to others. Share 
    what you know by offering advice on magic, battle tactics, trade skills, quests, 
    and so on. Aiding other players in game like giving directions,escorting people, 
    other forms of behavior can only benefit oneself positively. Members are not 
    required to give money or anything else to beggars, if they do so, it is their 
    own choice. You are encouraged to converse and group with your fellow members. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3. Guild Chat:</b> 
    - includes shout's, ooc's, and say's. It is fine to speak in other languges 
    as long as you do not spam guild chat with them, although if you are asked 
    to speak in common, please do so. It is fine to joke around as long as the 
    other person and the rest of the guild knows that it is indeed a joke. Foul 
    languge and spamming will not be tolerated. Refrain from broadcasting arguments,keep 
    it in tells. If a solution cannot be reached, contact an officer or the guildleader 
    to be the mediator. Open criticism of an individual member, arguing and bickering, 
    and saying things for the sole purpose of stirring up trouble in guild say 
    will not be tolerated. If you have a problem with a particular person then 
    take it up with that person on a one-on-one basis. If you do not feel comfortable 
    doing this, ask an officer to mediate for you. Using guild chat as a medium 
    to perpetuate an argument is frowned upon. Take it to tells or a chat room. 
    An officer may give requests if he/she believes that the discussion has passed 
    the point of what everyone needs to hear. If you do not take it to tells, 
    at that point you are subject to disciplinary action up to and including removal. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>4. Requests for - General 
    Assistance or Information:</b> If a request for assistance or information 
    has been asked within the guild chat, please do not ignore these requests; 
    assist IF you can, if you cant at least reply. Do not assume someone else 
    will. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>5. Requests for - Revives 
    or Resurrections: </b>A request may only be made twice with no less than 5 
    minutes between requests per death. Clerics will not be responsible for corpse 
    retrievals. A location of the resurrection must be decided upon prior to revival 
    with consent from all parties involved. Clerics are not to be expected to 
    leave a group or other activity they may be involved in to perform a "rez", 
    nor is it the clerics responsibility to revive you every time you die. The 
    final decision is the clerics. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>6. Requests for - Teleports: 
    </b>State your location and destination when asking for port. When needing 
    a port, please try to be at the druid ring, wizard spires, or other agreed 
    upon designated place prior to pick-up. Requests for teleports may only be 
    made twice with no less than 5 minutes between requests. Druids and or Wizards 
    are not expected to leave a group or activity they may be involved in to teleport 
    someone. Final say is that of the Wizard or Druid. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>7. Requests for - large 
    guild assistance for quests:</b> Should be posted on the community or in the 
    forums so that people may respond to their availability. We cannot guarantee 
    assistance in these quests, but we will try. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>8. Requests for - Power-leveling:</b> 
    Planned power-leveling may be posted for lower level characters as an event 
    such as a raid or guild party. Power-leveling should not be begged for, but 
    if it is offered up by a higher level, it is a decision of the higher level. 
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>9.</b> <b>Guild Events 
    and Raids: </b>Anyone can post the intent to have a guild event or raid. The 
    post should be on the guildsite at least 3 days ahead of time and contact 
    an oficer so that they may put it on the guildmotd (there are exceptions with 
    spontaneous events). If a raid or event is scheduled and you are tardy do 
    not expect to always be able to join once it is under way. Some raids may 
    involve moving through dangerous areas that would make it very difficult or 
    impossible to join the raid or for someone to leave to get you. Be considerate 
    of those that were on time. Don’t whine, complain, or criticize their decision 
    to begin the raid. It is not their fault that you were tardy or that it was 
    not a convenient time for you. When raids are scheduled all guild members 
    are encouraged to attend. Not every raid will have any tangible benefit for 
    you, but every raid we do as a team will only serve to strengthen our bond 
    (and our levels). Plan ahead if a raid or event is scheduled. Anticipate the 
    need for a teleport and arrange it with a member or outside party ahead of 
    time if you cannot be available when or if the event has ports scheduled. 
    Anyone can plan an event or raid. Finally, all raids should have a definite 
    anticipated beginning and ending time. Both of these times should be reasonable 
    and adhered too as much as possible. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>10.</b> <b>Leaving 
    or banishment from the Guild: </b>Exceptions to these guidelines are only 
    permissible via an e-mailed appeal to the leader. Re-applying back to the 
    guild must be done with the leader via e-mail or tell. If you have left the 
    guild under good terms you may request re-invite from an officer in tells. 
    If you are instructed by an officer to contact the leader, do not side step 
    that officer to find one that will, this will not be tolerated. If an officer 
    denies you access back into the guild and you feel unfairly treated you must 
    bring this up with the leader. If you were an officer, officership shall not 
    be granted at time of re-invite or may never be an option. If you are removed 
    from the guild, all other guild characters played by that you will be removed 
    as well. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>11.</b> <b>Officer 
    Conduct:</b> An officer must conduct himself/herself in a manner respectful 
    their rank. As one of the guild governing ranks an officer must act accordingly, 
    following and upholding the conduct and codes of the guild. An officer is 
    expected to make every attempt to attend scheduled council meetings. In the 
    event of a dispute in the guild, you are the voice of reason within. Advise 
    argueing parties within guild chat to take the dispute to tells. If called 
    upon as mediator in a situation, remember to listen to both sides of the story 
    and use your best judgment. If you have deemed a member unsavory, this member 
    needs to be brought to the attention of the leader via e-mail or tell. Respond 
    (not react) to situations with good humor, dignity, and diplomacy. </font></p>
