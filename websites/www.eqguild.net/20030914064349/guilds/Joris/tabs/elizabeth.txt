Verse:

A                   E
i was wasted in the afternoon
Gadd6        Dsus2
waiting on a train
i woke up in pieces and elisabeth had disappeared again
i wish you were inside of me
i hope that you're ok
i hope you're resting quietly
i just wanted to say

Chorus:
A E G D
goodnight elisabeth

Verse:
we couldn't all be cowboys
so some of us are clowns
and some of us are dancers no the midway
we roam from town to town
i hope that everybody can find a little flame
me, i say my prayers,
then i just light myself on fire
and i walk out on the wire once again
and i say

goodnight elisabeth


Verse:
i will wait for you in Baton Rouge
i'll miss you down in New Orleans
i'll wait for you while she slips in something comfortable
and i'll miss you when i'm slipping in between
if you wrap yourself in daffodils
i will wrap myself in pain
and if you're the queen of California
baby i am the king of the rain
and i say

goodnight elisabeth

repeat A E Gadd6 Dsus2 until end
