  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>OVERVIEW</P>
  <P>The following instructions assume you have:</P>
  <P>A WIN98 SE Bootup Floppy Disk. </P>
  <P>A WIN98 SE Installation CD. </P>
  <P>and that you are going to perform a 'clean' install of Windows 98 SE by formatting the hard disk prior to installing the Windows software</P>
  
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>PRELIMINARIES</P>
  <P>Start the computer by pressing the start button . </P>
  <P>Press the CD-ROM button to eject the CD-ROM tray. </P>
  <P>Place the WIN98 SE INSTALLATION CD on the CD-ROM drive tray and then close the tray. </P>
  <P>Shut down the computer. </P>
  <P>BOOTING UP THE COMPUTER USING THE FLOPPY DISK</P>
  <P>Insert the WIN98 BOOTUP floppy into the floppy drive. </P>
  <P>Press the start button on the computer. </P>
  
  <P>The Computer will bootup off the system written on WIN98 BOOTUP floppy disk.</P>
  
  <P>After the standard PC bootup checks have been completed, the following three options will appear on the screen:</P>
  
  <P>1.&#9;Start Windows 98 Setup from the CD-ROM </P>
  <P>2.&#9;Start computer with CD-ROM support </P>
  <P>3.&#9;Start computer with out CD-ROM support </P>
  
  <P>You need to Format the hard disk prior to installing Windows 98, therefore:</P>
  
  <P>Select option 2 (using the keyboard arrows to select it) and press the ENTER (return) key located on the keyboard. </P>
  
  <P>You will be presented on the screen with the DOS prompt pertaining to the Floppy Disk (A:) as set out below:</P>
  <P>A:\&gt;</P>
  <P>A: represents the floppy drive in MS-DOS. You need to change the DOS prompt to the CD-ROM drive (D:) to access the files on the CD. To do this.</P>
  
  <P>At the DOS prompt type in:</P>
  <P>D:</P>
  
  <P>Note: the letters on the screen should read:</P>
  
  <P>A:\&gt;D:</P>
  <P>Press the ENTER (return) key located on the keyboard to execute these instructions. </P>
  <P>You will then be presented with the DOS prompt pertaining to the CD-ROM drive (D:) as set out below:</P>
  <P>D:\&gt;</P>
  <P>FORMATTING THE HARD DISK (C: drive)</P>
  <P>For a 'clean' install of Windows 98 (recommended), the computer's hard disk needs to be wiped clean of any old files and formatted prior to running the WIN98 installer.</P>
  <P>The FORMAT software is located on the WIN98 CD in the win98 folder.</P>
  <P>NOTE: The actual file location of the FORMAT software is D:\win98\format</P>
  <P>To format the computer's hard disk, type in at the DOS prompt (D:\&gt;)</P>
  
  <P>win98\format C:</P>
  
  <P>Note 1: There is a space between the word format and letter C</P>
  
  <P>Note 2: The full text on the screen should read:</P>
  
  <P>D:\&gt;win98\format C:</P>
  
  <P>Note 3: Translating the above MS-DOS 'code':</P>
  <P>D: is the CD in the CD-ROM drive,</P>
  <P>&gt; is the prompt where you start typing instructions to the computer</P>
  <P>win98 is the folder (on the CD) in which the format software is located</P>
  <P>\ is the symbol used to define a new folder (called a sub-directory in MS-DOS land)</P>
  <P>format is the instruction to format the specified disk</P>
  <P>C: is the primary hard disk drive installed in the computer which is about to be formatted.</P>
  
  <P>Press the ENTER (return) key on the keyboard to initiate these instructions. </P>
  
  <P>You will be presented with the following warning:</P>
  
  <P>WARNING, ALL DATA ON NON REMOVABLE DISK DRIVE C: WILL BE LOST!</P>
  <P>Proceed with format (Y/N)?</P>
  
  <P>Select yes by pressing the y key and then the ENTER (return) key on the keyboard.</P>
  
  <P>Make a c:\windows\options\cabs directory and copy the files from the win98 directory on the CD-ROM to the cabs directory.</P>
  
  <P>a:\&gt; c:</P>
  <P>c:&gt;md windows</P>
  <P>c:&gt;cd windows</P>
  <P>c:\windows&gt;md options</P>
  <P>c:\windows&gt;cd options</P>
  <P>c:\windows\options&gt;md cabs</P>
  <P>c:\windows\options&gt;cd cabs</P>
  <P>c:\windows\options\cabs&gt;copy d:\win98\*.*</P>
  <P>Where d: is your CD-ROM drive.</P>
  <P>The c:/windows/options/cabs directory was a convention established with the standard installation some of the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) versions of Windows 95. You could copy the win98 directory to any desired directory on your hard disk and install from there, but I continue to use the convention so I can remember where the cab files are located. </P>
  <P>Cab or cabinet files are files containing one or more compressed files. Most of the Windows 98 files are in cab files on the CD.</P>
  <P>Install Windows 98 by typing the following command at the MS-Dos (C:) prompt:</P>
  <P>C:\windows\options\cabs&gt;setup</P>
  <P>At this point simply follow along by answering whatever questions Windows asks to the best of your ability.</P>
  
  <P>FAT32 Your Drives </P>
  <P>StartButton/Programs/Accessories/SystemTools/DriveConverter(FAT32), then follow the wizard.</P>
  
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Update Your Windows Files</P>
  
  <P>Namely, download and install DirectX8.1 from http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</P>
  
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Re-install any hardware drivers that you need by going to the manufacturer’s website and downloading the latest drivers…eg. video, sound, cable modem, etc…</P>
  
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Re-install Everquest</P>
  
  <P>Once you have done this proceed to copy the files that were originally copied onto the blank floppy diskette back into your Everquest program folder.</P>
  
  <P>Connect to the EQ servers and download all the necessary patches (automatically done once you connect) PS…don’t forget to download and install all the optional patches also.</P>
  
  <P>Copy all the files that were copied onto the blank formatted diskette back into your Everquest folder.</P>
  
  <P>Voila!</P>
  
  <P>Shutdown and Restart your system and you’re ready to go…=)</P></FONT></BODY>
