The home to the God Veeshan, this is one of the most unusual zones in the game.   It can only be reached through a wizard gate spell (using a very expensive component).  You then need to purchase keys to travel from island to island.  Thus, gettin around here is not cheap.   It is basically a combination of the Temple of Solusek Ro and the Planes of Hate and Fear in conception.  One part of the zone is devoted to quests.  The quests are all class specific and result in some very nice items.  The rest of the zone contains various high level monsters.  It seems that most if not all of the items you need to complete that quests are found in the plane.
<P>
Faerie Island - Starting island. Kill Faeries - Drop a Tessera, 3 swords, 3 Rabbits Feet each. Kill all the Faeries to get the swords and feet and then kill the princess to spawn Sirran the Lunatic. Hand swords and feet to Sirran the Lunatic for Key of Swords and Key of  the Misplaced. Talking to Sirran other than hailing is a bad idea. Nothing on this island is aggro., everything but the key masters assists. No AE on this island the quest hall is below you, the efreeti will come to beat you down.  From here you can use the Key of Swords to go to Noble Dojorn (Island 2) or Azaracks (Island 3) 
<p>
Noble Dojorn Island - On this island are Noble Dojorn and 2 Bladestorms. The bladestorms will assist dojorn, none are aggro. The bladestorms if pulled off 
the island will move to isle 4 and stay there (via someone aggroing them then jumping off the island). Dojorn will always return home. Kill Dojorn and loot. You must have the key of the misplaced from isle one to leave this island. Behind Dojorn's windmill is a port to Azarack island, use Key of the misplaced to activate. Note: Killing Dojorn spawns the Overseer of Air on island 5. 
<p>
Azarack Island - 9 Azaracks, all aggro, 1 is the PH for the Protector of Sky. Azaracks drop multiple key pieces and quest items. The doesn't mes easily are 
tough to kill. One the protector spawns he will despawn in 80 minutes. You must dispatch the protector to spawn Sirran. Hand him the key pieces grants 
you keys to Gorgalosk isle. 
<p>
Gorgalosk Isle - Ton of mobs, non-aggro, all except shimmering meteors assist. Most of them drop key pieces and quest pieces. Killing Gorgalosk spawns Sirran, hand key pieces to receive keys for Pegasus isle. 
<p>
Pegasus Isle - 3 Pegasii, 3 Griffons, non aggro, assist. Also the Overseer of Air if you killed Dojorn (not sure how long overseer stays up). Killing the 
Overseer spawns the Hand of Veeshan. Each Peg/Grif will split into 2 when killed, each split will respawn once (so each is 5 mobs total). The original 
pre-split mobs drop key pieces. 1 Griff and 1 Peg are placeholders for the Collector of Souls. All splits and collectors despawn in 80 minutes, all splits, the collector and the overseer are aggro. To spawn Sirran, kill a collector, turn in key pieces for next keys. These CAN be pulled to Gorgalosk island (via monk with safe fall or aggroing one and reviving puller). 
<p>
Spiroc Island - 11 Spirocs (small aggro) 3 vanquishers, 6 various, 1 Guardian, 1 Lord. Small aggro, do not see invis, will often walk over you without aggroing. The spirocs are in groups of 3, one vanquisher and 2 other related. Until the appropriate vanquisher is killed, his 2 assigned compatriots will respawn instantly (at home point, not slaying point) when killed. Only vanquishers drop quest pieces. This does however make spiroc quest pieces somewhat more common and farmable. Until the e triads are down the guardian will constantly respawn as well. To defeat this island kill a vanquisher and it's 2 guards. Do this for all 3 sets, then kill the guardian then the Lord. Killing the lord spawns Sirran and allows you to get keys to Bzzazzt island. 
<p>
Bzzazzt Island - This place is a nightmare. Before leaving Spiroc island INVIS. These creatures have huge aggro, but do not see invis. Invis, use your key to get up then quickly run behind the large gear near the portal off this rock. From behind there are 3 Bzzazzts. The Left Bzzazzt (from behind) splits like a pegasus 1/2/2, these are very rough. We had chanters sleep the other 2 while took this set out. Dictate here is very powerful, only way to charm the splits and a charmed split will make short work of it's friend. All splits despawn in 80 minutes. The Right Bzzazzt splits 1/3, tough fight. Leave the center bzzazzt for last. If your goal is JUST advancement, kill the left and right bzzazzts and loot key pieces. Wait 80 minutes and do CR, leaving the center Bzzazzt alone for you to kill. The Center Bzzazzt when kills spawns another bzzazzt, then a bixie , then a bixie boss. Each of these is on an 80 minute timer from when it spawns. the final Bzzazzt spawns Sirran. Sirran on this island slightly different. you need to give him a phrase (I don't know it yet) to spawn the Sister of the Spire on Drake isle. You can proceed to drake isle without spawning the Sister but you will not proceed to butterdly/Veeshan's Isle without spawning her. Hand in keys as normally (and hopefully) you have spawned the Sister. Bzzazzts CAN be pulled to spiroc isle, we managed to pull one of 3 and then the other 2 got bugged (ha ha) and split in a locationg we couldn't pull from) 
<p>
Drake Isle: No aggro mobs here, all assist but sphinxes. Kill everything for key pieces. Kill the Sister to spawn Sirran and get keys for the last isle. 
<p>
Butterfly Isle: Eye of Veeshan always up. Hand of Veeshan if you killed the overseer.
