 <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><b><font size="5">General Rules</font></b><br>
 <br>
 <b><font size="4">Level Cap:</font></b><br>
 <br>
         We currently have a minimum level requirement of 25 in order to join the 
 guild. This does not apply to members adding alternate characters. This level 
 requirement will change as the needs of the guild change.<br>
 <br>
 Membership Requirements:<br>
 <br>
 1. Must post on message board, their desire to become a member under<br>
 2. Must have grouped with a member(s) on several occasions. That member(s) can 
 then sponsor the person if they wish. Sponsorship will help get the person in.<br>
 3. Level requirement of 25 is needed.<br>
 4. We are recruiting any classes.<br>
 <br>
 <b><font size="4">Play Nice:</font></b><br>
 <br>
         Our guild was founded with the idea of helping others, as well as 
 helping ourselves.<br>
         The Play Nice rules posted on www.everquest.com site will be adhered to. 
 These include, but are not limited to, no training others, foul language, 
 harassing other players, general misconduct. Any reports of this are grounds for 
 immediate probation for the period of 1 month, and guild removal for any reports 
 of the same, thereafter.<br>
         Remember one thing, your conduct reflects directly upon our guild, and 
 anyone who does not care enough about the guild to make and keep a good 
 reputation, is not welcome in the guild.<br>
 <br>
 <b><font size="4">Officers:</font></b><br>
 <br>
         Officers were originally created by our Founder/Leader, Rudker. We have 
 lost many of them due to various reasons, and I have created new Officers to 
 replace them. From this point forward, members will be promoted to Officer 
 status based upon the need to fill a position, and by recommendation of a 
 majority of current Officers, with final approval by myself.<br>
 <br>
 Our Officers have the authority to /guildinvite as well as /guildremove people 
 at their discretion based upon the posted rules and the situation at hand.<br>
 <br>
 Our Officers have the authority to give commands to the membership having to do 
 with behavior and in raid situations, and what they say will be followed. 
 Insubordination will not be tolerated.<br>
 <br>
 <b><font size="4">Complaints:</font></b><br>
 <br>
         If you have an issue with a fellow member of the guild, bring it to the 
 attention to an Officer or myself.<br>
 <br>
         If you have an issue with an Officer, bring it to my attention.<br>
 <br>
         Friction between fellow members only detracts from our solidarity as a 
 guild, and reduces our overall enjoyment of the game and each other.<br>
 <br>
 <b><font size="4">Raids:</font></b><br>
         Raids can be just for fun, and at the last minute among those willing to 
 do something at the spur of the moment.<br>
 <br>
         Scheduled raids will be for one of the following specific reasons:<br>
 <br>
 1.    To kill a specific mob e.g. Epic mobs.<br>
 2.    To camp a certain zone for the betterment of the guild e.g. 
 Planar raids<br>
 3.    To hone the raiding skills of our membership<br>
 <br>
 <b><font size="4">Loot:</font></b><br>
 <br>
         Dropped useable items will be randomed first among those classes able 
 and willing to use, particularly No-Drop items. If nobody needs that item to 
 use, it will be randomed among all those in attendance who want in on the roll 
 (excluding No-Drop, which will be looted and destroyed)<br>
 <br>
         One person from each raiding group, generally the healer, will be 
 assigned to Master Loot. At this point in time, we are putting the cash drops in 
 the Guild bank. Nobody will loot except for the one assigned in each group to do 
 so.<br>
 <br>
         Gem drops and pp items (jewelry, etc) will be given to an Officer 
 attending the raid, and will either be banked for future guild use, or sold for 
 the guild bank.<br>
 <br>
         Spells, Pages, Words, and Rune drops will be banked for future use by 
 guild members of the respective class.<br>
 <br>
 For raids scheduled to help a specific member of the Guild, only that member is 
 allowed to loot his or her mob.<br>
 <br>
 <b><font size="4">General Raid Rules:</font></b><br>
 <br>
 1.    Do NOT expect experience on a raid until Verant Interactive 
 patches raidwide experience distribution. Every attempt will be made to balance 
 the groups made so that one group is not gaining all the kills.<br>
 2.    Do NOT expect cash loots at this point in time, this will 
 change in the future.<br>
 3.    DO pay attention to the Raid Leader(s) and Officers, and 
 follow their directions. You may not understand or agree with them, but follow 
 what they say, regardless.<br>
 4.    DO make an assist button to assist the main tank. If you 
 need help to make one, send a tell to an Officer in-game. Everyone should be 
 assisting the main tank, with the exception being the secondary tank.<br>
 5.    Do NOT attack the targeted mob until the main tank calls 
 for the assist. This is so he/she can gain firm agro from the mob, which will 
 reduce the chance of that mob aggroing another raid member, particularly the 
 casters, who have low HP to begin with.<br>
 <br>
 Raids are about teamwork. There is no such thing as "My mob", or "My loot", or 
 "My exps". Not on a raid. If your biggest concern is one of these, and you're 
 not going to contribute to the success of the raid, don't even bother coming.<br>
 <br>
 These rules are our basic guidelines, and will be subject to modification as we 
 gain new skills and/or understanding of any given situation.<br>
 <br>
 Anyone not willing to adhere to these rules are welcome to either remove 
 themselves from the guild, or not raid with us, as the case may be.<br>
