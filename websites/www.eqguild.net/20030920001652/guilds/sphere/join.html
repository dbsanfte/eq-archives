 <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FFFFFF">It isn't difficult.
 You need only to have a willingness to help others, a strong sense of Honor
 and Morals, and a desire to join the best darn guild in Norrath! If you
 meet these qualifications, and are at least level 20, then you qualify!
 Simply post a message here on </font><font color="#3366FF"><a href="http://pub65.ezboard.com/bthecrystalinesphereboards">The
 Crystaline Logs</a> </font><font color="#FFFFFF">under the "Applicants"
 forum, or send one of our officers a tell in game. Remeber that we are
 free to turn down anyone at anytime, and possibly without explanation.
 We never do that of course, but it could happen. Before posting your message
 or sending that tell, be sure to check over the Charter, and check the
 Members list make sure there isn't anyone on there who you KS'd or Trained
 in the last 30 days LOL :-P</font></font>
