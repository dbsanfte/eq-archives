              <p>What's a charter?<br>
                <br>
                If its anything like the United Nations Rules of Engagement, then 
                no, this is nothing like that. And no offence to anyone who has 
                served with the UN either.<br>
                <br>
                We DO like to have fun and its even better when there are other 
                people to goof around with too. And that is the main rule we follow. 
                Please be advised, that a lot of us are crusty old farts (read: 
                over the age of 26) and while in the guild, if you are not prepared 
                to be chippy or sarcastic, you may feel overwhelmed.<br>
                <br>
                Respect yourself, your fellow guildies and your fellow players 
                in the game. That's all we really ask for.<br>
                <br>
                Kill lots of mobs, get lots of levels and loot. Repeat as necessary.<br>
                <br>
                Well, on to the <b>basic rules </b>for potential recruits.<br>
                <br>
                <b> 1)</b> You must provide an email address so you can be inundated 
                with loads of email spam on a daily basis. This may change if/when 
                there is a large number of active guildies, or when we get the 
                message board fixed.<br>
                <b> 2)</b> You must display the guild name at all times. Just 
                use /role instead of /anon. Be proud to be Tarnished. Well, its 
                not really a rule, but we would prefer you show your colors.<br>
                <b> 3)</b> There are no level caps at the moment. But don't join 
                us thinking you are going to be automatically twinked. You need 
                to learn your class and learn it well. Our experience has shown 
                us that a single group made up of people that know their roles, 
                is a lot more effective than three pickup groups.<br>
                <b> 4)</b> All new members are subject to a minimum of a 2 week 
                probation subject to the officer's approval. During this time 
                you can be booted with no explanation necessary. Usually, we will 
                give an explanation, but the officers reserve the right.<br>
                <b>5)</b> No alts will be allowed until your main is at least 
                level 30. This shows us that you you have the bare minimum of 
                experience to make a good showing for yourself.<br>
                <b> 6) DO NOT BE AN IDIOT IN OR OUT OF THE GAME.</b> In this kind 
                of setting, a person's rep is everything, doubly so for your guild. 
                This guild was made up of close friends, and we'd all like to 
                leave the game as friends. If someone accuses you of anything, 
                or if you need help, your guild will back you up. But if the fault 
                is yours, and especially if we find out afterwards, you will find 
                yourself with no support. Conduct yourself in a civil fashion, 
                you represent the Guild when you are playing.<br>
                <b> 7)</b> Until such time that the original group of Heroes quits 
                the game, or a majority officer decision is made, all officers 
                will be inner circle people, or alts of the same. We've known 
                each other the longest, and we trust each other the most. But 
                never fear, you can eventually work your way up into a position 
                of trust. Remember, trust is always earned, never given for free.<br>
                <br>
                <b>General rules on guild conduct</b><br>
                <br>
                <b> 1)</b> Don't beg. Whether its for assistance, items, cash, 
                buffs or anything else I may have missed. Ask once or twice. If 
                there's no response, assume its because we are busy fighting or 
                otherwise. We'll answer or help when we can.<br>
                <b>2)</b> Loot rules. Main characters get the goodies first. Usually 
                because we are the ones risking ourselves to get it. Our focus 
                is to equip our high level mains first, so they can continue getting 
                stuff for the guild later. If mains don't need the equipment, 
                then it goes to the alts. Please respect this rule.<br>
                <b> 3)</b> As we mentioned earlier, we like to kid around, and 
                make wise-ass remarks to each other, IN GUILD ONLY. This does 
                not give you the right to be an ass to anyone in or outside the 
                guild. Feel free to join in the fun, but if an officer tells you 
                to shut it, then do so. If you want to argue with someone, take 
                it to tells. Don't announce it for the entire guild or zone to 
                hear. And while on the topic of arguing<br>
                <b> 4)</b> If there is a conflict, refer things to an officer. 
                That's part of our job, dealing with these issues. The game can 
                get frustrating, but that's no reason to take it out on fellow 
                guildies or friends. Stay cool.<br>
                <br>
                Now that everything has been explained, if you're interested in 
                joining, send one of us a tell and we'll be more than happy to 
                speak with you!</p>
