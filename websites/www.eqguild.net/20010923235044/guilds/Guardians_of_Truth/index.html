            <p><b><a name="policies"></a>New Guild Policies</b><br>
              Hello all members of the Guardians of Truth</p>
            <p>I have modified the names of different positions on guild (<a href="http://www.guildmagic.com" target="_blank">guildmagic</a>).</p>
            <p><u>First we have <b>SENTRYs</b></u></p>
            <p>These are all the normal members of the guild, and your job will 
              be to keep the name of the guild in a good standing</p>
            <p><u>Secondly we have the <b>WATCHERs</b></u></p>
            <p>These are the people who have given themselves to the guild to 
              use.</p>
            <p>It is these people who watch over us all, and also it is these 
              that shall pick the ones to join us.</p>
            <p><u>Lastly we have the <b>GUARDIAN</b></u></p>
            <p>He/She is the one who keeps us all in line, and who shall in the 
              end make the most difficult decisions. It is also his/her responsibility 
              to answer for the things we as a Guild do. A new Guardian will be 
              chosen every 6 months and he/she can remain the same person as long 
              as the guild so sees. Any Guardian that steps down from his position 
              will stay on as a Watcher.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>These names are to make us work more like guardians and not as 
              a group of missfits. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>As we have started to grow and to get more and more high levels 
              on it is also time to make a rule about inviting people to the guild.</p>
            <p>Any Sentry that meets a possible canditate will inform a Watcher 
              at first possible situation. The Watcher is after that responsible 
              of the invite. Any new joinee is after the invite to log on to guildmagic 
              AND guild forum as soon as possible. It is the responsibility of 
              the inviter to tell them the address of the guild site and to tell 
              invitee to join up in <a href="http://communities.msn.com/EQGuardiansoftheTruth/messageboard.msnw" target="_blank">our 
              forum</a> and <a href="http://www.guildmagic.com" target="_blank">www.guildmagic.com</a>.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The loan list is being updated but I should have it up in a week.</p>
            <p>The biggest change is the fact that i will move Creoimthain to 
              Freeport Bank to be the new mule. He is a Watcher so he can invite 
              people in an emergency.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I will not be using MOTD anymore to inform of any raids, we have 
              a forum and an calender to fill that job, so lets start to use them.</p>
            <p>MOTD will be used by Watchers to inform us of major things or to 
              remind us of the web address.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Thats all for now my fellow brothers</p>

            <p><b><a name="Kaesora"></a>Raid on Kaesora: Wow!<br>
              </b>Wow! That is the first word that comes to my mind when i think 
              of this one. Though we did not have a large amount of people, only 
              15 I think, everyone worked together and gave it thier best, resulting 
              in an incredible amount of kills. Though there was the one incident 
              in room 6, everyone knows what im talking about, it was terrific, 
              and some nice loot was gotten. Luminary two handed sword, spectral 
              shroud, kuzvar mantle, spirit tome (went to an out of guild person), 
              tombcarver, cryptrobbers knive, mask of the eight eyes. I personally, 
              being the lowest lvl on the raid, got over 2 gold bubbles of exp, 
              making my day much brigther. I hope to see the rest of you officers 
              holding great raids in the near future, thank you all for a great 
              time.<br>

            <p><b><a name="lucan"></a>Raid on Sir Lucan: What on Earth Happened?<br>
              </b>Ok the raid started looking nice, me an Milrsok scouting the 
              place and doing plans. I started to shout a warning 1 hour before 
              the raid no problems so far. At the 45 min warning i get a tell 
              &quot;Lucan is camped&quot; this is when things started to go wrong.... 
              I talk with this Lucan camper and find out that they too have planned 
              this for 2 weeks. <br>
              So what to do?<br>
              Being a diplomatic I in the end make a deal with them, they get this pull and they help us later. So no problem they pull Lucan 
              and start to fight it. But guess what they havent done their homework, 
              mainly they DONT kite Jentry away, so Jentry heals Lucan all the 
              time and THEY DIE....<br>
              So i get a tell from the Pally who is doing this &quot;Im dead go 
              for it&quot;<br>
              and we go for it, no groups, no healers distributed among us, but 
              still we go for it, and we kick Lucans butt. So i make the final 
              blow, see Lucan going down and i am on the 
              top of the world. I start to loot it but before i get a chance, 
              im being hit by 2 more guards, im down to 1 bub LoH used and i have 
              died allready once, so i run to zone. I ask Celebcuron to assume 
              the loot pos, but I dont give the details so he asumes the loot 
              pos for the Human Lucan, not knowing it is the skel Lucan who has 
              it, my mistake again. <br>
              OK i zone back in being healed and knowing the guards have left. 
              And i find the puller of this other group at loot pos of the skel, 
              so no way to loot it i start to tell this other Pally &quot; WTF 
              your puller is looting?&quot; and the he tells me sorry im french, 
              dont know english, i ment you kill it. At this time Ama is telling 
              this puller chick to give me the loot, but no go. <br>
              So at last when this other Pally shows up and is about to loot the 
              skell, the skell DECAYS away.<br>
              The puller send me an apology later on, though. <br>
              But that Pally never said anything to me after this, nor did any 
           
              other of his group.</p>
            <p>So the lesson from this:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Being nice is good, but i for sure will never again give a camp 
                to others</li>
              <li>We should have grouped up before they pulled, that way, we would 
                have been EVEN better able to take him down</li>
              <li>I will post my whole plan on the Forum of how to do it, and 
                im sure it would have worked too. I will organize a new raid sometime 
                soon.</li>
              <li>I will post the talks we Watchers had of the raid rules and 
                other things on the forum soon too. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b><a name="Unrest"></a>Results of Raid on Unrest</b></p>
            <p>I would like to extend my thanks to all who attended the Unrest<br>
              raid in a form or another!</p>
            <p>The raid was a success at long last in the end despite slight misgivings 
              on my part, but it the end all went well and all had fun even.It 
              was a challenge to hold but everyone did their part to most they 
              could so that added to their successess.</p>
            <p>I would like to extend many thanks to the 14 to 20 and later named 
              15 to 22 group for their patience and endurance in the face of the 
              sometimes humungous trains and party wipeouts, sometimes it seems 
              that the small mansion is larger than it seems especially when we 
              try to reach the trains in time to stop em.<br>
              The loot was not great but I did not expect it to happen, but it 
              seems that all had fun in there at least from all the tells I got 
              afterwards.</p>
            <p>More thanks will be going to the risktaking trainstoppers and underground 
              delvers aka 30 and over group who even went as far as to drop down 
              the pit trap to see whats in there, althought im not entirely sure 
              about their real intention of visiting that place...</p>
            <p>Special mention to Kreeze and Gryffudd for their support role for 
              15 to 22 you guys are great!</p>
            <p>Note of warning to future raid leaders: ALWAYS take a bind somewhere 
              nearer than the Arena when hosting a raid in Faydwer...</p>

            <p><b><a name="Warrens"></a>Raid on Warrens small but cozy</b><br>
              Hi everyone! Thanks so much for attending our newbie alt raid. It 
              was a lot of fun, but quite insane as train after train of higher 
              mobs pounded down on us. I would like to extend a special thank 
              you to Trunlith and Kanive for babysitting and to Ladenya for not 
              only participating in the raid but for finding the time to resurrect 
              a guild member during it! </p>
            <p>-iluvia</p>
            <p><a name="Runnyeye"></a> <b>Runnyeye Raid a Smashing Success!</b><br>
              Thank you all for a nice raid.<br>
              Well the loot sucked but we did have fun.<br>
              I learned something too, during a raid you should put either group 
              say or guild say on auto, that way we save a little on the spam. 
              The amount of text moving is awesome, i was busy just keeping an 
              eye out and i wasnt in a group. <br>
              One thing we did wrong, the leader of the raid should be kept informed 
              of things, like group splits or moves. There were moments i had 
              no idea where people are. On the other hand when we did get things 
              rolling we got some nice camps (Pity the King never popped). And 
              i got the impression you all liked it.<br>
              <br>
              This has been the first succesfull raid, and im proud of you all. 
              When we hit over 20 guildies online i was so impressed.<br>
