FUEL - BAD DAY


A F#m D Dm
D E F#m E
D Bm

	When it says "A*" it means that it's not a straight "A" chord but 
rather there is a little variation 
where the B string is left open when playing the "A" chord. If you 
listen the song you can hear it. The same 
goes for "F#m*", except in this case it goes for F#m to F#m7 (in which 
the second fret on the D string is 
played rather than the fourth).

	Verse 1
A*

A*
Had a bad day again
		     F#m*
She said I would not understand
				D	Dm
She wrote a note and said I'm sorry I
		   A*
I had a bad day again

	Verse 2
				A*
Spilled her coffee broke a shoe lace
			    F#m*
Smeared the lipstick on her face
				D	Dm
Slammed the door and said I'm sorry I
		   A*
I had a bad day again

	Chorus
	D		  E	F#m
And she swears there's nothing wrong
  E	   D		  E	F#m
I hear her play that same old song
    E	    D		   Bm
She puts me up and puts me on

	Verse 3
		A*
I had a bad day again.
			F#m*
She said I would not understand
			 D		Dm
Left a note and said I'm sorry I
		A*
I had a bad day again

Solo

	This is just mainly for referference, because the solo is so easy to 
figure out that 
you can probably find out a way that works for you better.
