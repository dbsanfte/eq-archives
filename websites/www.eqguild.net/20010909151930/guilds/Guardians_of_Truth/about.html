            <p>The Guardians of Truth are one of the many guilds of Everquest, 
              but we'd like to think that we are one of the best. Why is that? 
              Because we are an interesting and very diverse group and we form 
              a cohesive family, always helping each other out. We can be found 
              on the Morell-Thule server, and we include members from almost every 
              race and class possible. Our members and officers are found on every 
              continent of Norrath. Because we are a relatively young guild, without 
              level restrictions, we are growing rapidly. Our members range from 
              the very low levels to characters in their lower 50's. To find out 
              more about our philosophy and rules, read on. If you are interested 
              in joining, contact one of our officers in Norrath or send us an 
              email and we'll look you up. </p>

        <tr>
          <td>Our philosophy is relatively simple: we believe in helping others. 
            We realize that the world of Norrath is a wonderful place, but is 
            not without considerable challenges and dangers. Everyone in Everquest 
            has had a fairy godmother or a knight in shining armor swoop in and 
            help them out at some time or other. Helping each other is what makes 
            roleplaying great. Unlike many other guilds, we do not have a level 
            limit. This is because we realize that often, low level characters 
            need the most help, and we would like to be there to help them out. 
            If you agree with our philosophy, please consider joining our family.

            <p>1. Have fun, it's just a game. Remember that and don't stress.<br>
              2. Respect the guild members, we are all here to enjoy our time 
              on the server. I'm sure we would all love to help you with every 
              request, but if the guild is busy, stop asking for the day.<br>
              3. Do not beg for Money, Magic, Equipment, Power leveling or ask 
              to be twinked. There is nothing wrong with making reasonable requests 
              (a TP or Bind) but if no one can, then accept they cant at that 
              time.<br>
              4. If you are looking to accomplish something you cant do yourself, 
              ask it up to the guild first, one of us may want join you on your 
              adventure.<br>
              5. Do not try to rip off your guild, If you get a Item is worth 
              300-500p offer it up to the guild for 300p or maybe even 200p.<br>
              6. Be polite and sociable with your guild mates. If a guild mate 
              makes a reasonable request, and you can help them, then do so.<br>
              7. If someone in the guild gives you an item or items, do not sell 
              them. If you are no longer going to use them. Offer them to a low 
              level character in the guild at no charge.</p>
