<br /> <p><I>(Note: Our charter is always a work in progress and will be updated as needed to serve the needs of the membership and to help the guild function more smoothly! Most recent additions 2/1/02 to the Level Representative, Applying for Membership Guild Chat and Treasury sections.)</I>
<br /><br /><B>Who we are and what we hope to accomplish!</B>
<p>Join us in building something that we hope will be great and wonderful!   Mirth and Mayhem!</p>

<p>One of the main goals of the Ring of Mirth and Mayhem is to have FUN  and to give our members a place to call home. We hope to become a circle of friendly faces with whom we can share the joys, as well as the trials and tribulations, of  adventuring throughout Norrath and Luclin.</p>

<p>Members of the Ring of Mirth and Mayhem should be people that YOU  would want to game with! We believe a good start is with honorable people who are not afraid to be thought of as caring and giving but who demonstrate dedication, bravery, and honesty and are also known for their loyalty and competence in battle!</p>

<p>We are founded with a spirit of sharing.</p>

<p>We hope that each of you will share with each other your knowledge of zones,  mobs, tradecrafts, weapons, strategies and other hints and tips you have gleaned from your travels so that  your guild family  can get the most enjoyment out of their adventures!</p>

<p>If a guild member asks for help and you are in a position to do so, please  don't hesitate.  But if you ask for assistance, know that
it is not always possible, for whatever reasons, for someone to drop what they  are doing to assist. </p> 

<p>If you are able to extend the spirit of sharing down to assisting other members with the passing down of your old gear to other members  the Gods and Goddesses of Norrath will smile favorably upon you, but  again we recognize the need to sell old gear for
upgrades of our own is often necessary.</p>

<p>We encourage members to exemplify kindness and not to be oblivious or  to others outside of our guild......a kind word, a spare buff, or a small item can sometimes change the outlook of the entire day for a stranger.  And that stranger may be grouped
beside you in a tight situation next week and may even be wearing our guild tag someday!</p>


<p>We hope that our family will grow and prosper and eventually be in a  position assist each other and even other guilds to raid those zones where we can obtain the gear needed to get stronger and even strong enough for those of us who are interested to
be able to attain our epics!</p>

<hr>
<p><a name="oproc"><font face="arial,helvetica" size="3"><b>Operational Procedures</b></font></a>
<br /></p>

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Membership</b> <br /></font>
We will temporarily close new applications when we reach 75 members.  This is it facilitate becoming a closer group by getting to know each other and being able to more effectively assist when we can. 

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Applying for Membership</b> <br /></font>
Interested parties must read and agree with the charter and then 
complete the <A href="application.html">online application</A> and also list their character on <a href="http://www.guildmagic.com">Guildmagic</a>.  


<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Minimum  Level</b> <br /></font>
15+ for main (Some initial exceptions will be made for folks who have recently "restarted" characters.) 

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Trial Membership</b><br /></font>
New members will have trial period of one month before they are considered  full members After one month a vote will be taken among the officers and the person  advised of the result.  If any guild member has a serious problem with a prospective member during their trial month, they should advise an officer or officers immediately. </p>

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Sponsorship  
</b></font><br /> Members are encouraged to “sponsor” their friends and companions as new members and recommend them for guild membership.  Members should only sponsor those they know and believe to be a good “fit” for the guild,  Sponsored members  only need to undergo a two week trial period, but the member sponsoring the new member is expected to help insure the new member understands the guild etc. </p>


<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Removal</b><br /></font>
We are crossing our fingers that this will NEVER be an issue but if it is necessitated, the removal of a member must be done by vote of at least 3 officers, after review of the situation and after speaking to all  parties involved. An email with the details of the circumstances leading to the removal will be sent to the guild leaders within 24 hours.  Removed members are also encouraged to send an email to the guild leaders. </p>

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Guild Chat</b><br /></font>
Please keep it FAIRLY clean, others may be more sensitive to swear words than you are. Also, while we consider all of our members adults, remember that not all of our members may be over 21!!  Be respectful of each other in all ways and please do not have arguments in guild chat, take it private. 
<br /> <br /> Also, please refrain from using sexist, agist, racist or other degrogatory language in guild chat or at guild functions. Again, please be sensitive to others.


<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Dues</b><br /></font>
No dues are required.  However, members encouraged to contribute to the treasury if they find  themselves in a position to do so. Monies collected in the treasury will be used to fund guild outings, help members with their tradeskills etc. 

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Treasury</b><br /></font>
The Guild Treasury is maintained solely on a voluntary basis.  All items and money comes from the generousity of other guild members.  All items in the treasury are available to guild members in need who have passed the one month trial period.   Donated armor and other loot will be held in a guild treasury and distributed to members on a need basis, at no charge to the member.  Members are encouraged to contribute old gear or weapons in "exchange" for new items but it is not required. Distributions are at the discretion of the Treasurer. Please be considerate of other members needs when requesting mulitiple items.

<br /><br />
If you receive armor or funds from the guild treasury will be expected to return when it is no  longer useful or to pass it on to other members.   In the instance of items that are "non returnable" -- research components, spells,  pp supplied to fund tradeskills etc. It is hoped that the member benefiting from the item(s) will offer the treasury items when they  have some available or provide tradeskill services for their guildmates at cost. 
<br /><br />
<B>HIGH END ITEMS:</B>
From time to time, high end items may find their way into our Guild Treasury.   Distribution will be decided by a vote of two officers in cases of very high end gear.  In the case of multiple requests for a single item, all attempts will be made to distribute to the requesting party with the greatest need.</p>

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Using Porters/Rezzers/Corpse Summoning</b><br /></font>
Members <I>may charge</I> for ports, rezzes etc. except when members are attending a specifically designated guild function. Members are encouraged to work out trades or other methods of payment if possible. (This policy is intended to prevent ourfriends and guildmates from being hounded for ports etc...) 

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Selling Gear to Members</b><br /></font>
Members are encouraged to offer their old gear for sale to other members if 
they can.  Sellers are <I>not expected</I> to sell gear for less than market value unless they feel able to do so, no one is expected to sell at a loss.

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Tradeskills</b></font><br />
Members are encouraged to take up tradeskills and to offer their wares to guild members at cost.  From time to time it will be possible to financially assist members with monies toward their trade development. 

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Roleplaying </b></font><br />
Roleplaying your character can be fun but it is not for everyone. Please be respectful of your fellow members. 

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Powergaming</b><br /></font>
The guild is not dedicated to powergaming though experience groups are certainly encouraged and as we grow raids will be planned for both exp and for loot.   

<p> <font face="arial,helvetica" size="2"><b>Power Leveling</b><br /></font>
The guild does not operate a power leveling service, though within the spirit of the guild, assisting other members in leveling is encouraged.  Players asking for help should realize that if someone is assisting them, they are taking time away from their our leveling and should be considerate of asking for assistance frequently.
