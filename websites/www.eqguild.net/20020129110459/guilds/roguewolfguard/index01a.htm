    Rouge Wolf Guard is a faction formed from the ranks of former members of the 
    Clan of the Running Wolves, though all are welcome to join our cause. This 
    faction formed when corruption within the Clan was discovered. A valiant but, 
    unsuccessful attempt was made to purge the evil from Guild, but the power 
    and corruption had a firm grip on the leadership to tightly to break loose. 
    The Rouge Wolf Guard then made the decision to break ranks, some forced out, 
    some leaving to not be party to the corruption around them, and regroup in 
    order to uphold the principles on which the Clan was originally founded. Honor, 
    Pride, and Brotherhood.</font></b></font></p>
