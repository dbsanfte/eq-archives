        Eek! <br> <br>If you can help me plesae do as ive got myself in a bit of a predicament :) <br> <br>Basically, I went to Velious last night in pursuit of a new spell, got trained and died in docks.  <br>No biggie you think but I'm bound in FV, naked and all my money on my corpse seriously reduces chance of getting TP and my biggest worry is enough food and water for boat journeys to BB then FP then Velious :( <br> <br>You can help by either A) Giving me some food and drink B) Tping me to WC C) lending me enough plat to get a TP or D) get me a rez/res whatever in Velious itelf should any of you be in zone and see cleric- I will donate 50PP for an ep res (hey I only got 100 to my name! :) <br> <br>heh, not begging, just mad at myself and feeling stooopid :) <br> <br>Khazbee

        Thanks Lilla, I was fortunate enough to beg food and water from Berties alt. I then managed to get a tp from a very kind druid by the name of Quinlain- if you see him ever, please buff him as you would me. <br>I then got double lucky meeting a cleric at docks, Elkish who rezzed me back to within a kill of 39 again- picked up a group and dinged back :) <br>Thanks for the offer, glad it wasn't needed :) <br> <br>Khaz
