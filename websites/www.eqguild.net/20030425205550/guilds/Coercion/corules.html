<li>No Officer wants to to de-guild anyone


<li>Members are expected to treat members and non members with courtesy and respect.

<li>If a Member is giving you trouble, please talk to an officer about it so that the 
situation can be fixed before it gets out of control.

<li>If complaints are received about a member, the member will be talked to about the 
event(s) in question. If complaints about the member continue, the member will be 
warned. If the complaints still continue and the officers are in agreement, the member 
will be de-guilded.

<li>Actions such as "Ninja Looting", "KS'ing", and "Training" may be serious enough to merit 
de-guilding a member without warning to the member.

<li>PvP areas are for PvP, and that some members may enjoy PvP. However, if you interfere 
with someones PvP event and they request that you stop you are expected to stop even 
if the request to stop is done in a rude manner.

Loot</b>&nbsp;]</font>
</center>
<p style="font-size: x-small">
Loot in Coercion is handed on merit basis. There are a number of factors that go into 
determining who gets what. The factors that determine merit in no particular order include, 
but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Attendance at Raids
<li>Last time gear was received
<li>Current Gear
<li>Willingness of the member to help others
<li>Overall contribution to the guild..
</uL>
</p>
<p style="font-size: x-small">
The officers try to do the best job possible when meriting an item, but we know we cannot 
please everyone and some of the decisions may be unpopular or upsetting. If you have a 
disagreement with a merit decision, please bring it up with an officer privately. Do not 
bring up your objections over guild chat. Please remember, there are going to be many 
members of the guild, all of which would like to receive some loot.</p>

<p style="font-size: x-small">
Droppable loot awarded on raids is considered property of Coercion. If you choose to 
leave the guild you are expected to turn in any droppable loot that you have been awarded.
</p>
<p style="font-size: x-small">
Members are encouraged to turn over offer old items for remerit when they receive 
something new.
</p>
<p style="font-size: x-small">
If you play a secondary character on raids by request, that time is known and reflects 
positively on you when determining merit loot on items for your main character.
</p>
<p style="font-size: x-small">
Secondary characters brought to raids are eligible for no-drop loot if no main characters 
need the loot. Non-merit dropped loot will be kept and either re-merited at a later date 
or sold for guild funds. 
</p>
<p style="font-size: x-small">
Remember! Every piece of equipment improved upon, every spell scribed helps the guild. 
The better equipped the guild gets, the better the guild will be prepared for tougher encounters.
