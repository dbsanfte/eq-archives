	<i><b>Step 1 -</b></i> Please read through the guild info and rules on this site. They can be found <a href="rules.html" target="_self">here</a>.<br><br>
	<i><b>Step 2 -</b></i> Applicants must meet our minimum level requirement of 45.
	<br><br>
	<i><b>Step 3 -</b></i> Applicants must find a current Omerta member to sponsor them into the guild. Once this step is done, applicants post their
	intentions of joining the guild on our <a href="http://pub83.ezboard.com/fomertaguildfrm9" target="_blank">Apply forum</a> with their character name, class, level, the name of their sponsor, which guild they were previously in, and why they feel they would make a good fit into our guild.
	<BR><BR>
	<i><b>Step 4 -</b></i> It is possible we may require more grouping with members first and/or an in-game interview. You must obtain the support of 6 members to qualify for a guildinvite. Once we as a guild are satisfied that all conditions are met and that the applicant would make a good fit into Omerta, an officer will contact them in-game for the guildinvite. This may take a few days or more from
	the time of applying on the forum.
	<BR><BR>
	<i><b>Step 5 -</b></i> The applicant will then undergo a probation period of one month. This gives us an opportunity to get to know you a little more, and for you to decide whether or not Omerta meets your own needs. When the trial period is over and all parties are satisfied you will become a fully fledged member of Omerta.
