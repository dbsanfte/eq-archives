  Am 		    C
  No milk today, my love is gone away.
      E                 Am      E             Am
  The bottle stands for lorn, a symbol of the dawn.
	            C
  No milk today, it seems a common sight,
      E                Am           E                 Am
  But people passing by. Don't know the reason why.

  A                        G
  How could they know just what this message means,
      D                               E      A
  The end of all my hopes, the end of all my dreams,
                         G
  How could they know, a palace there had been,
  D                              E         A
  behind the door where my lover eigned as queen.


  Am                C
  No milk today, it wasn't always so,
      E           Am      E                 Am
  The company was gay, we turn'd night into day.


A                E         D               E
  But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
A            E          D  
  A terraced house in a mean street back of town
A           E             D            E
  Becomes a shrine when I think of you only
  D                  E
  Just two up two down.


  No milk today, it wasn't always so,
  The company was gay, we turn'd night into day.
  As music played the faster did we dance
  We felt it both at once, the start of our romance.

  How could they know just what this message means,
  The end of all my hopes, the end of all my dreams,
  How could they knowm a palace there had been,
  behind the door where my love reigned as queen.
  No milk today, my love is gone away.
  The bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn.

  But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
  A terraced house in a mean street back of town
  Becomes a shrine when I think of you only
  Just two up two down.
