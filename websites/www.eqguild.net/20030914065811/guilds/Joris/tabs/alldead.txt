All Dead All Dead
Words and music by Brian May
----------

    Dm      A      Dm
She came without a farthing
           A     Dm
A babe without a name
         C        F
So much ado 'bout nothing
   Gm         A      Dm
Is what she's try to say

So much ado my lover 
So many games we played
Through ev'ry fleeted summer
Through ev'ry precious day


	C   F    Gm  F
	All dead all dead
        	Bb        F
	All the dreams we had
	                   Dm         Bb   C F
	And I wonder why I still live on
	C   F    Gm  F
	All dead all dead
	     Bb       F
	And alone I'm spared
	           A7      Dm
	My sweeter half instead
	    Bb       F        Bb
	All dead and gone all dead

	All dead all dead
	At the rainbow's end
	And still I hear her own sweet song
	All dead all dead
	Take me back again 
	You know my little friend's
	All dead and gone

Her ways are always with me
I wonder all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child


	All dead all dead
	But I should not grieve
	In time it comes to ev'ryone
	All dead all dead
	But in hope I breathe 
	Of course I don't believe
	You're dead and gone
	    Bb       F
	All dead and gone
