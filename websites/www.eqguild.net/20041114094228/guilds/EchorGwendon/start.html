<P>How It All Started...

<P>For many of us, the story of Echor Gwendon begins in the damp and darkened bowels of Blackburrow. The frequent cries for help and curses of trained-upon newbies echoed up the stone walls to the sympathetic ears above. Many went elsewhere to find loot and experience, while others stayed behind and banded together against sure frustration and death. Many of those allies made in desperation became friends. Safety in numbers, you know.
<P>Many months later, after much hardship and a certain authoritative head-headedness *ahem*, Echor Gwendon came into being.

<P>Echor Gwendon is not an Uber Guild. Our goal is not to lvl as fast as possible, or to get the Uber Phat Loot. We came together to have fun, and to enjoy each other's company. We enjoy this game; we PLAY. We have a great time, and everyone gets a turn being the butt of our jokes *grin*. We are a Circle of Great Friendship.
