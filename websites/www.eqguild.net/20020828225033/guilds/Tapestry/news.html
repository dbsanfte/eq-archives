<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Welcome to the new website!!&nbsp;
I hope you like the changes I made.&nbsp; I was very excited to complete
this, and I would like to know <a href="mailto:to_heroes@charter.net?subject=New Webpage!">what
you think</a>.</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>In other news:&nbsp; Congrats to
Cascheus on being named Officer!</font></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>And one last time, PLEASE!!!!!,
get me your info again so that I can update the profiles page!&nbsp; Thank
you!</font></font><font color="#FFCC33"><font size=+1></font></font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33"><font size=+1>July 5, 2002</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>After some disheartening news about
our guild mates and friends Aleph and Eyecis, and my own bout with computer
problems and heat sickness, things are coming around to normal again.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>As you can see, I've revamped the
site a bit.&nbsp; I'm hoping to get some info on hosting soon, so maybe
this address will change too.&nbsp; I will for sure let you know.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33"><font size=+1>June 8, 2002</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>As a reminder to everyone:&nbsp;
you must read the charter, understand it, and agree to it.&nbsp; Part of
that charter details that you should let the Battle Master know if you
are unable to make it for a raid.&nbsp; All the information is posted on
this site, so there is no excuse to not get the Battle Master your answer.&nbsp;
There will be multiple warnings issued for failure to do this.&nbsp; Please
make sure you understand the charter.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Also, I added a new line to the
charter under the New Recruits section.&nbsp; It details that all new recruits
must sign up for and use the forum.&nbsp; I also expect this of the members
currently in the guild.&nbsp; Please use the forum, as it will help us
keep our communication lines up.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33"><font size=+1>May 30, 2002</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>I added a link for our <a href="logo.jpg">Crest</a>.&nbsp;
This is still a work in progress, but I wanted you to see it and let me
know what you think.&nbsp; All of the symbols stand for something.&nbsp;
The blackrose is for our Battle Master Lennel Blackrose;&nbsp; the tree
is for Enforcer Aleph Sylvanus (which means tree);&nbsp; two stars for
Chaplain Troha Twinstar;&nbsp; and the dragon is for Lore Master Taxuman
Lastpenny (don't ask).&nbsp; After all, these guys have kept this guild
together through some tough adversity, and I am paying tribute to them
with this crest.&nbsp; They are the heart and soul of this guild, and I
will never forget that!</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33"><font size=+1>May 24, 2002</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>I got the armory page up and running
now.&nbsp; All those items are on my mule Mulasie.&nbsp; If you wish to
add or check out from it, just send me an email, and I'll see what I can
do for you.</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>In other news, lets keep up the
recruiting.&nbsp; It seems to be slow, but I'm sure we can do it!!&nbsp;
Let's rock ToH!!</font></font>
<p><font color="#FFCC33"><font size=+1>May 13. 2002</font></font>
<br><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Revamped the site to update all
the things that have been missing or erroneous.&nbsp; Check out all the
links, and let me know if you spot any errors as I typed this stuff late
tonight (or early morning actually).&nbsp; Hope everything gets back to
normal soon!!</font></font></blockquote>
