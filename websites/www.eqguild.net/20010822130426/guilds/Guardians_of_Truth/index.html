            <p>Hello all members of the Guardians of Truth</p>
            <p>I have modified the names of different positions on guild (<a href="http://www.guildmagic.com" target="_blank">guildmagic</a>).</p>
            <p><u>First we have <b>SENTRYs</b></u></p>
            <p>These are all the normal members of the guild, and your job will 
              be to keep the name of the guild in a good standing</p>
            <p><u>Secondly we have the <b>WATCHERs</b></u></p>
            <p>These are the people who have given themselves to the guild to 
              use.</p>
            <p>It is these people who watch over us all, and also it is these 
              that shall pick the ones to join us.</p>
            <p><u>Lastly we have the <b>GUARDIAN</b></u></p>
            <p>He/She is the one who keeps us all in line, and who shall in the 
              end make the most difficult decisions. It is also his/her responsibility 
              to answer for the things we as a Guild do. A new Guardian will be 
              chosen every 6 months and he/she can remain the same person as long 
              as the guild so sees. Any Guardian that steps down from his position 
              will stay on as a Watcher.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>These names are to make us work more like guardians and not as 
              a group of missfits. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>As we have started to grow and to get more and more high levels 
              on it is also time to make a rule about inviting people to the guild.</p>
            <p>Any Sentry that meets a possible canditate will inform a Watcher 
              at first possible situation. The Watcher is after that responsible 
              of the invite. Any new joinee is after the invite to log on to guildmagic 
              AND guild forum as soon as possible. It is the responsibility of 
              the inviter to tell them the address of the guild site and to tell 
              invitee to join up in <a href="http://communities.msn.com/EQGuardiansoftheTruth/messageboard.msnw" target="_blank">our 
              forum</a> and <a href="http://www.guildmagic.com" target="_blank">www.guildmagic.com</a>.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The loan list is being updated but I should have it up in a week.</p>
            <p>The biggest change is the fact that i will move Creoimthain to 
              Freeport Bank to be the new mule. He is a Watcher so he can invite 
              people in an emergency.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I will not be using MOTD anymore to inform of any raids, we have 
              a forum and an calender to fill that job, so lets start to use them.</p>
            <p>MOTD will be used by Watchers to inform us of major things or to 
              remind us of the web address.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Thats all for now my fellow brothers</p>
