home of the Greycat Tribe.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#000000" size="3" face="arial, helvetica">We are currently aspiring
to create a new guild on the Luclin server. Once we have a quorum we will
then make the guild official. <br>

</font><font color="#8080ff" size="3" face="arial, helvetica">Our Charter 
</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="arial, helvetica"><br>
<br>
  We are dedicated to the exploration of Luclin and Norrath. As a result
the tribe will migrate once every two weeks or so to new territory. We are
a tribe of nomads with a proud Vah Shir history although we accept members 
from any race and class. We help one another and our friends. We ask that 
all members work on tradeskills and languages as well as their class skills. 
We are highly honorable as we must depend on each other for our very existance. 
Most of all, we want to have fun and build community spirit. We are democratic, 
we vote on where to move to and Guild leadership and policy.<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#8080ff" size="3" face="arial, helvetica">History of the
Greycat Tribe</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="arial, helvetica"><br>
<br>
  The Greycat Tribe has a history reaching back beyond the first days of
Vah Shir civilization. At one time the Greycat's held the throne of the Vah
Shir empire but the royal line was slain by the ancestors of the current
king. Stories were told among the tribe of treachery by the usurper but the
younger generations having worked with the king through the time of troubles
when the Vah Shir were exiled from Norrath have formed a grudging respect
for him. They have even begun to question the validity of the stories and
seek to know if our royal line was itself corrupt and lost in decadance before
they lost the throne.<br>
<br>
  The Greycats have always been nomads and are skilled in trades, languages, 
and the art of making profit from transporting the hard to find supplies and
items that they encounter on their travels. The Greycats are proud, never 
begging for anything, and always seeking to find some way to pay back any 
kindness shown to us and also seeking ways to do a kindness for others, especially
 if it doesn't cost us any of the money we need to see us through our wandering 
lifestyle. We maintain a list of both friends who have done us good so that 
all might know to aid them and of all who have done harm to one of our members 
so that they might be placed in coventry. We are all ambassadors for our tribe
and all should be glad to see the Greycats travels bringing them together
 with new friends.<br>
<br>
  The Greycats are interested in different cultures and peoples. We are concerned 
generally with the history of Norrath and Luclin and their races. We are passionate
about Vah Shir history and are always seeking to learn more about the history
of the old kingdom and the circumstances of the disaster which exiled us
from Norrath. We are looking for the truth of the stories of the  usurpation
and if the King's ancestors did behave treacherously then our blood will
demand vengence and we will move to slay the king. To aid us in this we are
devoted students of language.<br>
<br>
</font><font color="#8080ff" size="3" face="arial, helvetica">Guild Policy</font><font color="#000000" size="3" face="arial, helvetica"><br>
<br>
  1. No begging, we are too proud to do so. Use of the Beg skill is OK however 
since it can be used to taunt and doesn't annoy other players.<br>
  2. With the exception of the founding members we need to start the guild, 
no one can join the guild until they are 10th level or above. Lower levels 
can still be affiliated with us, helped by us and migrate with us. The reason 
for this is that lower levels are considered Cubs and as such would be kept 
isolated and protected by the tribe until they have the skills and maturity 
to deal with outsiders.<br>
  3. We are democratic, we can vote on Guild leadership, Guild Policy and 
Migration Destinations. The current leader is only doing the job because it
was his idea for the guild and has never run a guild before so please be
patient with him.<br>
  4. Officers are required to check on the members they recruit to see that 
they are doing what the guild needs them to do and that they are getting what
they need from the guild.<br>
  5. Anyone can be made an officer to help in recruiting since we'll need 
people who are on at different times and those people who choose to stay in
one place and not migrate would also be useful for recuiting. Officers with
fancy titles will be created as special rewards for outstanding Guild activities.<br>
  6. Priority is given to Corpse finding and retrieval since that is a task 
we all must face and can often be a difficult challenge.<br>
  7. We are a roleplaying guild so please try to remain in character as much 
as possible. Also it is fun to think up a history and lineage of your character 
and to create tribal lore events and history that we can add to enrich the 
guild.<br>
  8. Every member must take on one apprentice at some point, they can take 
on more if they want but one is required. The apprentice should be about 10
levels below the teacher and should be helped for about five levels. Help 
can include guarding their backs while they fight, grouping, buffing, healing, 
etc. Help does not have to include giving gifts if you have no surplus.<br>
  9. We migrate approximately every two weeks at an agreed upon time or in 
shifts if we get enough people who play at different times. If someone takes 
the time to bind us all then they will be rewarded by everyone chipping in 
a PP or two so that they can buy new spells since it would be a pretty boring 
process for them and unproductive. Group, bind, bind, bind, bind, meditate, 
degroup, group again, bind, bind, bind, etc.<br>
  10. Among the tribe, when asking some tradesperson to make you something 
you will supply the raw materials needed plus a bit more so that they can 
practice their skill and have something to sell. Tradeskills are very important 
to nomads so everyone needs to develop at least one tradeskill.<br>
  11. Language skills are also very important to nomads. Everyone should
train a point in any new languages they see offered. We will try and hold
language fairs where everyone spouts gibberish at one another in their chosen
language until the language skills improve.<br>
  12. We are strict adherants to the play nice policy. Annoying other players 
is strictly verboten. If we choose to camp a site we'll be nice and share 
with anyone doing the same thing. We will also do our bit to be nice to other 
players regardless of guild. If we encounter annoying players we'll put them 
on a list here so everyone can add them to their /ignore and place them in
 coventry.<br>
  13. Guild punishment, which I hope will never ever be necessary, will include 
probation for 2 weeks, being placed in coventry, fines, and banishment. The 
Greycats themselves will be called to sit in councel to determine what will 
happen to any given offender.<br>
