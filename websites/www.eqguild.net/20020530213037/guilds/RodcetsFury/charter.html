 <p><b><u><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Guidelines for Loot</font></u></b>
 <p><font size=-1>Rodcet's Fury is a need before greed or NBG guild. Meaning
 if you need it and will use it and no one else needs it it will be yours.
 If someone else needs and will use it you will have a /random for it. Once
 you win a item at a raid. You will be out for any more loot till everyone
 else has won something. Anything item/spell not claimed while on a guild
 raid will be put in the guild bank. Then any member who can and will use
 can ask for the item and be given it at no cost.</font>
 <br><font size=-1></font>&nbsp;<font size=-1></font>
 <p><b><u>Guidelines for Membership</u></b>
 <p><font size=-1>At this time Rodcet's Fury is having a open recrut which
 means just about everyone who shows interest in the guild will get invited.
 This section will change as our recruting needs change.</font>
