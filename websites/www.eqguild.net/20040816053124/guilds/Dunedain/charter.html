The Great Dunedain<br>

<br>
<p>There's a name that you hear when they talk about men who are brave.<br>
They used to use fire and swords for the evil they slayed.

<p>They roamed over all of the earth,
<br>Though not very many were they.

<p>They were battered and stung, but they finally won.
<br>And they seem to be out there again.

<p>The battles they fought and the causes they fought for were grand.
<br>Battles that bred many heroes and saved many lands. 

<p>The honor the had was bizarre,
<br>seen only in each others eyes.

<p>But you're glad they were there, they put faith in the air.
<br>That evil might finally be stayed 

<p>So up go the horns to the battle,
<br>the horses go on to the field. 
<br>The demons are high in the numbers,
<br>and the bridge has already been sealed. 

<p>There's a name that you hear, when they talk about men who are brave.
<br>And you'd better be happy that all of your heroes were saved.

<p>For they're going all over the earth,
<br>and no, not very many are they.

<p>But they're fresh from the skies, and they won't ever die,
they've come back to guard you and me.

<p>So up go the horns to the battle.
<br>The horses go on to the field.
<br>But the demons are hiding in people,
<br>and people should only be healed.

<p>So up go the horns and the spirits,
<br>for the good won't be hurt by the rain.
<br>And the Grey Wizard will guide them together.
<br>Together the great Dunedain. (LoTR)
