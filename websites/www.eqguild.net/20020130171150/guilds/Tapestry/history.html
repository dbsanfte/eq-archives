 <blockquote><font color="#FFFFFF">Formed in the fall of 2001, Tapestry
 of Heroes was my attempt at creating a guild that people would love to
 be in.&nbsp; I had been in one previous guild, and felt frustration at
 the lack of leadership and smart playing that I had cultivated in myself.&nbsp;
 I was constantly begging for officership and was continuously told that
 I was being considered, but we had enough officers already.&nbsp; I was
 one of the 3 people left from the forming of that guild, and was put off
 by the rudeness of the guild leader.&nbsp; So I decided to start out on
 my own.&nbsp; After a few months of hacking around ideas for guidelines
 for the new guild, and a few ideas for the title, I came up with Tapestry
 of Heroes.</font>
 <p><font color="#FFFFFF">One of my first rules, like all rookie guild masters,
 was the creation of a level limit (14).&nbsp; After I had trouble rounding
 up the needed people, I considered using lower level characters.&nbsp;
 Then I started to think about saving the world.&nbsp; It's my very nature
 to want to help people (probably why I chose a druid), so I figured I could
 also make the game more enjoyable for all by "training" new recruits as
 well.&nbsp; So I opened up the level restrictions I had previously put
 on the guild, and said "I can start training the newbies to be smart players
 too!!!"&nbsp; In this way I rounded up the needed players and started the
 process.</font>
 <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The creation night was a mess from the start.&nbsp;
 I happened to pick the night of a GM event over at the Arena, so needless
 to say the GM's were very busy.&nbsp; I also had trouble getting the necessary
 10 people to form the guild.&nbsp; Sadly to say, some of those people are
 no longer with the guild.&nbsp; But in the end we got it created.</font>
 <p><font color="#FFFFFF">So from there, I made all of the original 10 people
 officers and told them to start recruiting.&nbsp; We have grown slowly
 but surely over these last few months, gathering together some of the nicest
 people I have had the pleasure to meet in game.&nbsp; And after all these
 months, I have only had to remove one person, which&nbsp; I consider to
 be my proudest accomplishment.</font><font color="#FFFFFF"></font>
 <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I wish to thank all of the people who have help
 keep this guild together these first few months.</font>
 <blockquote><font color="#FFFFFF">First on that list is my good friend
 Mawr.&nbsp; He is my in game adviser and confidant, whom I have never met
 in real life.&nbsp; Thanks for the help.</font>
 <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Then there is my friend Remie (who sadly sold
 his account).&nbsp; His help was some of the best I have ever gotten.&nbsp;
 Thanks bud!</font>
 <p><font color="#FFFFFF">And lastly, I wish to thank my brother Micos.&nbsp;
 He is the rock that has held me together for so long both inside the game
 and out.&nbsp; He got me hooked on this game, and on life itself.&nbsp;
 For all the things you've done bro, thanks a ton!</font></blockquote>
