Pre raid</i><br>
Please be at the meeting location on time or early. There are a substantial number of people who will be late, and if you are on a reserve list and there on time, you might just get one of the late people's spot, if you are on the group list, be early, or at worst, one time. If the raid leader has to fill a lot of empty group slots, it could take up to an hour to work it all out.<br><br>

If you need transportation to a raid and you arrive late, realise that the wizards and druids that you are asking to port you have made it on time, are probably in a group, and are buffed. Leaving a raid to pick up your late ass is often a serious inconvenience. They will need to be rebuffed and may lose a spot in a good group or the chance for a no-drop item. You should try everything in your power to get a port from someone who is near you, even if that means paying them 100pp. Ask for a port from a raid member as a last resort.<br><br>

Please be sure to bring the food/water/spell component supplies that you will need. For Old Sebilis or Howling Stones or any of the numerous zones that require keys to get into, bring your key with you. Clerics and Enchanters bring enough Peridots to buff your whole group for 6-12 hours. For Kedge keep, bring your Fishbone Earring/Rebreather/Ancient Fishing pole, or a lot of fish scales so that you can breath underwater. If you have not been in a zone before, please ask what you need to bring.<br><br>

Some of the loot from the raid might be given to a specific person. If this is going to occur, the raid organiser should make that clear before the raid starts, preferably as part of the announcement for the raid. This is an issue only for Epic-piece raids. We will make sure that you don't need to be concerned about distinctive looting raids when it goes about plane armour.<br><br>

Respect your raid personnel, they are probably swamped with tells. Ask your group leader your questions first. If they cannot answer you, they can probably refer you to the person that can answer your question. If you have issues with the way things are being run, please bring them up after the raid. If you berate the raid leader during the raid about something you think is unfair, don't be surprised when you are not invited back or asked to leave, even if you were right! If you have immediate concerns, please send a /tell to the Raid leader with your concerns in a calm and courteous manner. You will be treated with the same respect or lack thereof as you give out.<br><br>

<i>The Raid itself</i><br>
Assisting: <br>
Please insure you know who the main assist (MA) and second assist (SA) are and set up hot keys for both. Please understand that if MA goes down or Link Dead (LD) in a fight, the SA will be promoted to MA and take on all the duties of MA until the original MA comes back. . Please do not add a comment to your assist hotkey, we don't need to see 36 people spamming us with /ooc assisting XYZ with this %T. We should all be assisting all the time. It should be second nature. <br><br>

Use that assist hotkey: <br>
Do not press f8. Do not target with your mouse. If you need to acquire a target, press your assist hotkey that you made. If you do not use that assist hotkey, you will get yourself killed and probably take an enchanter and shaman with you (*sweat*). 
<br><br>
There are some exceptions to this rule: <br>
If you are an enchanter or otherwise in a crowd control role on the raid, you may target however you darn well please. If you are in a de-buffing role, it is important to get the MA's target de-buffed first. After that is accomplished, you can start de-buffing any mob that has been successfully Mesmerised (mes) or otherwise stopped. Damage breaks mes. De-buffs do not break mes. If you are in a de-buff role on the raid, usually only Shaman and Enchanters, you may target and de-buff a mob that has been successfully mes'ed without using your assist key. If you are not sure you are an exception to the always assist rule, please send a tell to your raid leader or someone he has designated to answer questions.
<br><br>
Wait for the MA to shout: <br>
The main assist will be making hotkeys to /shout out their targets, something like /shout smashing <<< %T >>> which when pressed would come out: XYZ shouts 'Smashing <<< an Ire Ghast >>>'. If you are SA, please have your hotkey ready, but don't use it unless the MA goes down.
<br><br>
Only MA breaks mes:<br>
If you break mes and you are not MA, you have probably just gotten an enchanter or shaman killed and you are the next on the list. Mes, slows and other de-buffs are a huge taunt. The MA will be taunting for 5-15 seconds in an attempt to get to the top of the MOB's hate list before he breaks mes. It is very important that you wait for the MA to shout the target. Once the main assist has shouted his attack, you may unload the firey wrath of heavens on that poor unsuspecting MOB (mobile object, or soon to be dead thing)<br><br>

Sometimes MA will be forced to change targets:<br>
Sometimes in PoH we will get a delayed pull and all the sudden we will have a spite golem beating on us. There are mobs out there that cannot be mesed. If you see the MA shout his target again, please hit your assist hotkey again. OK, you did it? You hit your assist key again? Well do it 2 more times to be sure. You can hit the Escape key and then your hotkey again anytime you are somehow unsure that you are on the correct target. Re-assisting is a good habit to get into. There might be a rare occasion that we get 2 un-messable MOBs at the same time. In this instance, it is permissible for the SA to target the additional MOB and tank it while the first is being killed. Unless you happen to be the SA, or the SA's cleric, this will not concern you, please continue to beat the living snot out of the MA's target.<br><br>

/shout:<br>
Raid Leader, MA, SA, Loot-master, Raid Police. If you are not on that list, please do not use shout unless we have an emergency that jeopardises the entire raid. You may use /ooc, but please try to keep the chatter down, especially during periods of heavy action or when the Raid Leader is trying to communicate. If you are a group leader and your group gets a kill, you can use shout to call the loot, some raid leaders prefer to reserve the /auction channel for calling loot.
<br><br>
Pets:<br>
Pets have the tendency to mess things up for the enchanters. I.e.: A mage has her skeleton pet up, she assists and sends her pet to attack the main assist's target. She sits down and an additional MOB (add) shows up out of nowhere and hits her. That add gets mesed, but her pet remembers that the mage got hit. Anytime during that fight, the mage's pet could decide that it hates that add that hit her a while ago and it will run over and hit it, waking it up. This gets the enchanter, then her pet, and then the mage killed. Pets and mes don't mix well. I do understand that some of you can control your pets better than that, I can too, but I don't put one up unless asked. There is too much to loose if you make just one mistake with your pet and it usually does not merit the risk. Anytime that you have the chance at getting more than one MOB in a raid situation you should leave the pet at home. Mages can Nuke and Necros can help the enchanters with Crowd control and do their very low resist lifetap line to help deal the damage.
<br><br>
DoTs:<br>
Damage over Time, a necro's best friend. Sorry, dark brothers, for the most part, DoT's are not allowed in raid situations and here is why. If the MA has to switch targets, the old target can be put to sleep by the enchanters, but not if it has a DoT on it. The damage every tick will wake it back up, making it very angry at both you and the enchanter that is trying to mes it, yet another situation where both you and the enchanter ends up dead.
<br><br>
Loot!:<br>
I knew you put up with all those rules for a reason. If you are a group leader, you will check the loot for your group if you get a kill. If you are not a group leader, you will not check loot unless directly asked to by the Raid leader or Loot-master. If you are a group leader, and do not want the chore of checking loot, please assign the duty to one of your group that you trust.<br>
OK, you are a group leader and just checked a Bogeyman's dead and twitching body. On the body are: a blighted robe (necromancer, no drop), a Blue Diamond, Words of Bondage and Ruby Crown. You need to /shout Necro Robe and BD on Boogie.<br>
No drop items, rare gems and rare droppable items get called out. Cash loot, research components and other weird things do not need to be called. You will get to know what needs to be called and what can be ignored after a while, that is why the Raid leader tries to pick seasoned experts as the group leaders. If that Bogeyman only had a sapphire necklace on it, you could call out /shout Boogie-MT. MT is short for Empty. All cash loot and droppable items should go to the Loot-master. The Loot-master's job is to rout all that loot to the correct people and to call for rolls when they are appropriate. Please do not random unless the Loot-master has instructed you to. It is disruptive.<br>
Rare Gems will be rolled on at the very end of the raid. If you won something during the raid, you will not be rolling for the rare gems. My goal is to have everyone leave with something from the raid. The Rare gems are Blue Diamond (BD), Diamond, Jacinth, and Black Sapphire (BS). All other gems are considered cash loot and some might be given to clerics and enchanters to cover their buffs.<br>
Research components and craft skill items will be distributed as the Loot master sees fit.<br>
The Loot-master will call for rolls on no drop items as soon as possible after the drop. If you win a no drop item, please do not expect get to roll again until all of your class has won a similar item. I.e.: the cleric bracer drops and you win it, if the cleric BP drops later and the other cleric on the raid has not won anything, they will be taking it home with them. Once all of a class has won an item from their class armour, all can roll again.<br>
Sometimes one member of a class is LD or has been killed when there has been a drop for their class. It is a Group Leader's responsibility to make the Loot master aware if you have a LD or dead person that should get a roll. In most cases, the Raid Leader or Group Leader will roll in place of the missing person. The preferred method is to get the person in question resurrected so they can roll for themselves. If be chance a LD person does win a roll by proxy, they will have 5 minutes to get back in game and loot their prize. After 5 minutes the next highest roll should win.<br>
Reserves that come up after the break is done: we have a one hour no looting rule. Some raiding guilds have a 2 hour rule, some have no rule. I believe that the people that worked hard to break the plane, typically the riskiest time of the raid, should be rewarded with a little bit better odds to get the loot that drops. This one hour rule also insures that the following situation never occurs: reserves are brought up, the mage robe drops. There are 2 mages one that has been there working hard for hours and the one that just spent 10 minutes. They roll off and the 10 minute mage wins and decided that he is done for the night and gates out. You have to contribute at LEAST an hour to an endeavour to be considered for loot. This rule can be waived at the raid leader's discretion, but woe to the raid leader who finds himself in that hypothetical situation.<br><br>

Raids have more than one part:<br>
There are 5 distinct parts of a raid. Group-making, the Break, the Raid, sometimes an Epic battle, and the Loot handout.<br>
Group-making is long and boring for everyone except the group-maker. That poor sot is being hammered with 3 tells per second and has to try to write people's information down and form balanced groups at the same time This will take between 10 and 90 minutes. <br>
The Break is perhaps the time of most uncertainty and excitement. This can be a very chaotic time, with some going link dead, feeling disoriented upon zoning in and running the wrong way, perhaps MA and SA both go down and no one is sure what is going on. All kinds of room for failure here. The key thing to remember on a planes break is to keep your enchanters alive. They will be working overtime to get any MOBs under control. They will be risking their lives so that all may live. If the enchanters stay alive, we will win. The second key thing is to listen carefully to the directions for the break. The raid leader may call for everyone to be invisible, or perhaps there will be specific instructions on where to run to when you zone in. The break takes from 20 minutes to 2 hours.
The Raid takes from 3-12 hours to get though depending on stamina, people leaving, availability of reserves and how fast we can plod through the MOBs. 
The Epic Fight is another part that does not always occur. They will be taken on only if we have the proper manpower to take the MOB down. This part usually takes around an hour. Epic parts will be open roll for the class that needs them. Sometimes a raid will be run to get a specific person a specific epic part, if this is the case, it will be part of the raid announcement and that person will get part without a roll. <br>
The loot takes a while to get through as well. We will either do loot after the last pull is finished, or we will all evacuate to Toxx forest and meet at the bridge for rolls on droppable things and rare gems. Some of the key players in the raid might be awarded a rare gem without having to roll. They worked hard for you, please respect the Loot-master and Raid Leader in the calls they have made. The loot handout takes from 10 minutes to an hour.<br><br>
Being a Group Leader<br>
Being a group leader will require some extra work on a raid. You will need to keep track of who is supposed to be in your group, both during group-making and during the raid. If "All Camp" is called, you will be expected to know who was in your group and to invite them without having to be told to do so. You will be expected to either loot all the mobs that you receive experience for, or to designate a group member to do it. You will be expected to make sure that the loot that your group checks/loots is called to the raid as a whole. You should aquire an idea of what loot drops in the zone where we are raiding and have an idea of what is junk and what is phatty lootz. You will be expected to understand your group's role, and make sure all your vital positions are covered. You are expected to keep on top of your group's status: mana levels, health levels, buff levels, empty slots, lack of a healer, who is LD and who needs a res. You will be responsible for keeping your group up to date on the status of the raid. If we are doing a massive corpse recovery, keep your group members up to date. It's a lot easier to sit around in Thurgadin, waiting around for a res, if your group leader gives you an update or three. You are the buffer and conduit between the Raid Leader and the Raiders. You are the unsung heros.<br><br>

Specific to Plane of Hate: <br>
The meeting spot for Plane of Hate (PoH) is traditionally the Wizzie Spires in South Ro. It costs 250pp per group to go up to hate. This is for the Soulstones that the raid leader buys in Neriak. You need one stone(250pp) per group that is going up, and at least 3 extras, for emergencies. Once in Hate, there is no evac, if a fight goes very badly, we will call CLERICS CAMP NOW. When the train is done, they can come back and res us all. After all cleric have camped out safely, you may attempt to camp out as well, in that situation .As a general Rule after clerics have camped, please log on as an alternate character (if you lived) and give the raid leader a tell. The raid leader should set his /AFK message to something like "Safe to log back in" or "Not safe to log back in".
<br><br>
Specific to Plane of Fear: <br>
The meeting spot for Plane of Fear (PoF) is traditionally the PoF Portal in the specter cave in Ferrott. BTW invis vs undead does not work against those specters and they have to be cleared.
