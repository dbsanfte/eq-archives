            <p align="left">Chaos is a guild made for comradeship. We’re here
            to enjoy game, adventure and have fun. Many of us have several alternate chars so that guild grouping options are more open.&nbsp;
            You might say we are the official
            guild of alts. ; ) Many of us like to spend some
            of our time role playing, meaning we create histories and
            personalities for our characters both in game and on the message
            boards. Role play is not required but everyone will respect those
            that wish to role play, in and out of guild.<br>
            <br>
            We don’t play to be uber… we are not power gamers... we don’t intend to be the
            largest guild on game nor the most uber high level guild. Our
            objective is as stated… to enjoy the game, have fun doing it, and
            for many of us… to give our characters life by giving them a
            personality to role play with. Of course, some of us come here to
            escape. = )<br>
            <br>
            Chaos welcomes characters of all races, classes and levels, the
            evil, good and somewhere in between. We often partnered with select members of other larger
            guilds. We group with these folks at times, but never ever expect
            them to assist anyone of our members for raids, questing, etc.&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">
            Remember, we are not an uber guild, we won’t twink your char or
            power them, and while some of us may do Planes raids and assist on
            quests, you won’t see us taking down Moushi or Lady Vox single
            handed anytime in the near future.<br>
            <br>
            All members will respect the privacy of each other. Several of in
            Chaos have high lvl primes outside of guild. If you know who
            someone's prime out of guild is, you WILL NOT disclose that
            information without that person's permission! Failing this, you will
            more then likely be removed from guild. Chaos is primarily made up
            of role players, primes, and several alts of high lvls looking for a
            break. Respect each other's
            privacy!!!<br>
            <br>
            We do not allow minors in guild. You heard right, we are an adult
            guild only. Reasoning for an adult only guild: We discuss adult
            issues at times and have no desire to be explaining adult issues to
            minors. This of course does not mean we accept crude behavior or
            language. We prefer folks to be 20 plus year olds.<br>
            <br>
            We follow Verant’s Rules of Conduct. Chaosians represent Chaos
            D’Ame at all times, therefore members are expected to uphold the
            rules and guild’s reputation by being a player of merit.<br>
            <br>
            In addition to Verant’s rules, we have a few considerations:<br>
            <br>
            <i>Item Requests</i>. Chaos is not here to twink your character.
            Some of our older members may hand down items as they see fit or
            give items to guild bank for distribution as officers see fit, but
            don’t expect them to. Don’t ask them to. As a necro friend says,
            “If you ask or tell me to you can bet I won’t.” On that note,
            begging is not tolerated, in guild, to guild, outside of guild, to
            non-guildies, etc, etc.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Power Leveling</i>. We all want to see our chars gain xp (okay
            well most of us), but like item requests, requests for powering is
            not acceptable. A few members of guild might get the whimsy to power
            a guildmate now and then, which is perfectly fine. Just remember,
            don’t expect to be powered, don’t ask to be powered.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Trade Skills</i>. Many nice items in game are tradesmen made.
            Chaos has several fine tradesmen. If you are in need of a crafted
            item, you can make a request (one request for that item to that
            person) to one of the tradesmen. No tradesmen is required to fill
            that request however, for whatever reason they give or don’t give.
            Most often you are expected to pay for the cost of materials and any
            failures. A guild tradesmen may charge whatever they see fit above
            these costs. Payment is expected up front. Being a tradesmen is
            costly in plat and time, please respect that.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Class Abilities</i>. Every class has needed abilities, some more
            then others. A person with needed spell abilities, be it porting,
            rezing, buffing, whatever, are not at anyone’s beck and call.
            While it is expected of all members to assist guildmates, do not
            expect someone to log off a current char to fetch the one you need,
            nor to leave a group or other involved situation to assist you.
            Matters like corpse decay, rez time running short, etc are
            considered of far more importance then porting you 3 zones away so
            you can do your thing.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Account Sharing</i>. If you share your account with other people,
            you are responsible for their actions while playing your Chaosian
            character!! We cannot state this enough. Poor conduct coming from
            your char, no matter who it is playing, won't be tolerated. More
            then likely you will be removed from guild immediately.</p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left">
            <b>Chaosian Role Play</b><br>
            <br>
            Role play adds flavor to the game, which after awhile, gets boring.
            You’ve hit level 60, are like a god now, nothing you can’t do.
            Except for get real bored. For some of us, role play brings fun and
            new adventures to game. Understand that we are NOT a role play guild
            but we do have role players in guild. A lot in fact. No one is
            expected to role play. Everyone is expected to respect the choice a
            player makes as to whether or not to role play their char.<br>
            <br>
            When in role play (in char= IC), remember that not everyone role
            plays, and someone that does may not be IC at any given moment. This
            goes for inside and outside of guild. Please do not interrupt role
            play in action if you are not a role player or are not in char.<br>
            <br>
            Chaos guild chat is most often ooc (out of character) talk, though
            you will see in char chatter going on, often to everyone’s
            amusement. When meeting up with a Chaosian, don’t expect them to
            be in char, but understand that they might be. You don’t have to
            play along, they don’t have end their role play. Some of us never
            step out of character. Also know that
            when hunting as a group, role play rarely happens, especially in
            group chat. When we hunt we tend to stay ooc (usually because many
            of us are mega pullers which leaves no time to banter in char).
            Chaos works well this way because we accept these simple guidelines.</p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left"><b>Guild Structure</b><br>
            <br>
            Officers of guild and the GM generally make decisions as a group,
            however, in case of indecision or possible harm to the rep of guild,
            the GM, or one of the Ambassadors in GM’s absence, has final
            authority. Guild officers have been chosen by the GM for their
            maturity and strength of character. Officers failing to maintain
            such qualities will be demoted. The chain of command is GM, Officers, Members.<br>
            <br>
            In addition to the title of Officer, some officers carry specific
            titles. Ambassador (handles inter-guild relations on reputation
            issues &amp; arranging alliances), Class Leader (leader of their class).</p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="left"><b>Officer Duties</b><br>
            <br>
            Officers are expected to be on game often, either as their prime in
            guild char or an alt in guild. (Often being at least 4 times a
            week… five minutes a time isn’t considered often.) Real life
            sometimes prevents game time... perfectly understandable. They are
            expected to be involved with guild matters (hunting with, assisting,
            use of the msg boards, participating in guild concerns and
            discussion, suggesting or sponsoring hunts). Since we are primarily
            a guild of alts, we are not overly active in planned events. At any
            given time there may be 2 to 15 of us on game, which makes it rather
            hard to do planned activities.<br>
            <br>
            Officers in guild prime and their in guild alts will be given
            officer abilities, but only their prime will carry the title of
            Officer.<br>
            <br>
            It is an officer’s duty to keep an eye out for potential new
            members… based on the uniqueness of our guild, who might be a good
            addition to the family. Invite such prospects to visit the guild msg
            board and to come hunt with us. But absolutely make sure they visit
            the msg board so they know what we are and what we are not! No
            minors!! Meaning we prefer 20 plus year olds. While there is no way to be certain of anyone’s real life
            age, at least ask them.<br>
            <br>
            New members are on a 30 day trial period. The inviting officer must
            email guild at chaos_dame@yahoo.com within two days of inviting a
            new member with full char name, race, class, lvl, and trade skill
            they might wish to offer.
