Elfmaid: Yes, I play EverQuest with my mother! I am the envy of many many
videogame players and I'm proud to admit that my mother is the original GamingGrl!<br>
      <br>
Two weeks ago or so, I was innocently visiting my mum in Seattle. On a lark
she let me fiddle around on her EverQuest account to see if I would LIKE
the darn game or not. <br>
With the patience of a saint she sat by my right shoulder and showed me the
wonders of the world of Norrath. An amazing 3d world unfolded before me,
complete with races and classes out of my old D&D days. After my initial
misgivings (and falling off of Kelethin's rope bridges alot and dying a few
times), I was hooked.<br>
      <br>
Yes, I can blame my newest 'addiction' on my mother.<br>
      <br>
After successfully getting a test character to level 15 with her help, she
then startled me by giving me my birthday present EARLY! <br>
      <br>
The basic EverQuest Trilogy was mine to import to Canada, with the mutual
promise that we would limit our time to a few nights a week, and that we
would have characters we could play together!<br>
      <br>
On the evening of October 18, 2002, we played together for the first time
and had an utter screamingly huge amount of fun!<br>
      <br>
Mum is playing Stumpyone, a sweet faced brunette dwarven rogue female. <br>
      <br>
*I* am playing Braevyan, an auburn haired woodelven bard female.<br>
      <br>
We play together on the Druzzil Ro server, with an eye toward trying our
hand at the roleplaying-only servers. We've applied to the Seekers of Lore
(but as of Oct.19/02 have not heard back from them), and if all else fails
we may start our OWN guild.<br>
      <br>
This page, AND THE OTHERS I PLAN ON MAKING TO FOLLOW, will soon contain screenshots,
and possibly links to our livejournal, where you can read about the silly
exploits of this particular roleplaying addicted family.<br>
      <br>
MORE TO COME SOON!....<br>
