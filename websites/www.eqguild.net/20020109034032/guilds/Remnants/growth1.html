<br>
<br>
Hi everyone, this is just a small "guide" I wrote to help you along your way in Plane of Growth. I'm not sure of the validity of all of this information - these are merely some observations I've written during my time in the Plane of Growth. This is not nearly complete and, as I just said, some of it might be incorrect. Nonetheless, I hope it will help any PoG "newbies." =)<br><br>

Protectors of Growth<br><br>
In order to succeed in the Plane of Growth, you must always be cautious of the protectors of growth, also known as PoGs. They have a constant spawn time of about 23-25 minutes (varies) and will agro a person who is NON-INVIS and KOS in the zone from anywhere. It will usually take half a minute for a PoG to travel across the zone to the zone-in. The best way to usually deal with these mobs are to have two or three people time them with stopwatchs and either...<br>
1. Have a level 60 enchanter charm one of them. Once the charm breaks, have the enchanter kite it around.<br>
2. Have the bard puller agro them when they spawn and then have the chain puller agro one off. The bard will kite the other around. 
I usually prefer the former.<br>
Being able to deal with the protectors is vital. So you know, the protectors are unmezzable and are about level 53-55. 
Anyways, moving on...<br><br>

Pulling in Plane of Growth<br><br>
This is a map of the Plane of Growth (see fig.1). However, after exhausting research and exploration in PoG (well, not really exhausting=), I have found a few errors. The modified map (fig2) is to the right of the original map. The forest spirits are on the EAST side of the stream, not the right, most importantly. I'm not sure of the validity of the locations on this map either.<br><br>

As you see, the Plane of Growth is split into two different sections, East of the stream and West of the stream. Below is the listing of all the mobs and drops that are on each side of the stream. <br>
(BTW - the links to the equipment are temporarily unavailable... at least until I upload them) <br>
East of Stream - This is the "harder" part of PoG. The mobs here drop breastplates and legs.<br>
---------------<br>
An entoling essence channeler - Conjuration robe/legs/arms (magician), Unmezzable. Level 57 to 60<br>.
An entoling culler - Sorcerer's robe/legs/arms (wizard), Unmezzable. Level 57 to 60<br>.
An entoling harvester - Bonecaster robe/legs/arms (necromancer), Unmezzable. Level 57 to 60<br>.
A feral amalgam - Assassin's breastplate/legs/arms (rogue), Berserker's breastplate/legs/arms (warrior), Mezzable. Level 52 to 56.<br>
A serene forest spirit - Melodic breastplate/legs/arms (bard), Spirit Weaver's breastplate/legs/arms (shaman), Unmezzable. Enchanter class mob. Level 60.<br>
A sylvan protector - Resplendent robe/legs/arms (enchanter), Silver Moon chest wraps/legs/arms (monk), Unmezzable. Level 53 to 56.<br>
A contemplative thrifling, a thrifling sprites - Stability chestplate/legs/arms (cleric), Noctivagant breastplate/legs/arms (shadowknight). Level 52.<br>
A phase puma - Stonewood Mail, Not sure if mezzable. Level 55<br><br>

West of Stream - This is considered the "easier" part of PoG (relative to the East side, of course=). The mobs on this side of the stream will drop arms, legs, bracers, boots, gauntlets, and helms.<br>
---------------<br>
A glade stalker - Melodic arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (bard), Spirit Weaver's arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (shaman), Mezzable. A caster with DDs and a nasty root. Level 51 to 55.<br>
A rolling plains steed - Bonecaster arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (necromancer), Sorcerer's arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (wizard), Conjuration arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (magician), Mezzable. A caster with DDs. Level 51 to 54.<br>
A gale wolf - Stability arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (cleric), Noctivagant arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (shadowknight), Mezzable. A caster with DDs. Level 49 to 52.<br>
A spirit flux wolf - Assassin's arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (rogue), Berserker's arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (warrior), Unmezzable. A caster with DDs and root. Level 51 to 54.<br>
A sanguine kodiak - Resplendent arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (enchanter), Silver Moon arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm (monk), Mezzable. A warrior class. Level 52 to 54. <br><br>

Misc mobs<br>
---------------<br>
A whorl of natural energy - Static at the zone in. Drops nothing and respawns quickly. Cannot see invisibility. Level 54.<br>
Farstride Unicorn - Drops nothing, as far as I know. Level 57.<br>
A reverant treant - All legs, the pathing for this mob is buggy, so you'll often find them hugging the wall. Level 60.<br>
Spirit Stalker - Drops nothing, as far as I know. Level 60.<br>
Guardian Power - Static spawn at the thrifling camps. Doesn't drop anything. Level 60. <br>
Anyways, a bard will make the best puller in this zone. It would help if this bard had a decent computer with graphics detailed turned to low, as this is a laggy zone. In the bard's group, he should have a warrior (to chain pull off him), a cleric (for quick heals), shadow knight/rogue (for corpse retrieval during failed pull), magician (for Call of Hero if bad pull), and an enchanter (to mez any additional mobs). The bard should be familiar with what mobs are mezzable.<br>
When pulling, the bard should have these 4 primary songs memorized. He should twist the speed song and the resist songs. The resists are so that you don't get rooted or nuked while pulling glade stalkers or the like.<br>
-Guardian Rhythms, for MR and AC<br>
-Elemental Rhythms, for CR, FR, and MR<br>
-Selo's Accelerando, for speed<br>
-Selo's Song of Travel, for scouting/exploring.<br>
Before pulling, the bard should have cleric AC, HP buffs, shaman HP buff, enchanter MR buff, and a DMF. Usually I use my Mask of Deception so I can see better in the dark. (note: Selo's Song of Travel overrides the levitation portion of DMF)<br><br>

There are a few different ways to pull multiple mobs, as this is a crowded zone when everything is spawned...<br>
1. If the bard pulls multiple mobs, have him kite them around while the chain puller pulls one off at a time. (difficult, but can work well if communication is good).<br>
2. If the bard pulls multiple mezzable mobs, then bring them to camp and have the enchanter mez. (Not really mana-efficient for the enchanter. C2 is a must in this zone, so you might want to keep the enchanter with enough mana to C2 everyone)<br>
3. If the bard pulls multiple mobs, have the magician CoH him back to camp. (Not as cost-efficient, but works very well while pulling the harder mobs)<br><br>

There are basically three safe camps for your raid party. Pretty much everywhere else in the zone is dangerous as there are many wandering mobs. (see fig.3) <br><br>

<a href="http://www.deadzed.com/eq/images/pog1-c.jpg">Figure 3</a><br><br>

West Wall camp - This is the camp you usually start out when you first zone in. You should pull the majority of the "west-side" mobs to this camp. It's relatively safe for both the raiding group and the puller. However, the whorl of energy sometimes is a problem for the puller when he's trying to chain pull. <br><br>
Waterfall camp- To get to this camp, you should invis everyone at the west wall camp and then tell them to follow the wall, keeping it on their left. It's a long run, but it's usually the safest. At this camp, you pull the entoling mobs, the feral amalgams, Fayl Everstrong, phase pumas. Beware Ail the Elder when pulling to this camp. (And turn off sound to get rid of that annoying waterfall splashing=) <br><br>
Lake camp - To get to this camp, you can either invis everyone at waterfall camp and tell them to follow the stream OR invis everyone at the west wall camp, and then tel them to follow the wall, keeping it on their rights. At this camp, you can pull thrifling sprites, sylvan protectors, feral amalgams, serene forest spirits, Treah Greenroot. Beware Ail the Elder when pulling to this camp. This is probably the most difficult of camps to pull to, as thrifling sprites are very small and hard to see and because there are many wandering sylvan protectors which can make your life a living hell. <br><br>
Note: As in all raids, keep everyone together in a tight group. When people begin to wander, mobs begin to agro. When CRing after moving from one camp to another, only let the bard or someone who's knowledgeable about the zone pull corpses.<br><br>

Quest NPCs<br><br>
Since the Plane of Growth is somewhat lacking in Paladin, Ranger, Druid, (more like completely lacking), Verant has tried to make it up by creating some ridiculously impossible quests for them. The mobs listed below are quest NPCs, so don't bother with them (unless you're bored).<br><br>
Guardian of Takish, Ancient Totem, Tunarean Earthmelder, Entrancing Water Nymph.<br><br>
They're all level 70, unmezzable (obviously), and drop nothing. I repeat, nothing. Also, so you know, the mobs surrounding the Ancient Totem, (mumbling totem man and vigilant convokers), drop nothing as well (as far as I know).<br><br>

Named Mobs<br><br>
Some important mobs that you should take note of (and check for on tracking) are the named mobs and the named treants (listed below)...<br><br>

Named Treants - These mobs are uber hard. They always drop a breastplate, but usually require 25-30 very high level and experienced players. All of the named treants are on the East side of the stream. Each have a particular pathing which the puller must make note of (see fig.4)<br><br>

<a href="http://www.deadzed.com/eq/images/pog1-p.jpg">Figure 4</a><br><br>

Ail the Elder - AE DDs and AE Silence. <br>
Rumbleroot - Summons serene forest spirits when agroed. 200k hp, hits for 800, and has a nasty DoT.<br>
Treah Greenroot - Summons sylvan protectors when agroed. 200k+ hp, hits for 750.<br>
Fayl Everstrong - Summons entolling mobs when agroed. 100k hp, hits for 750-850. <br>
Ail the Elder and Rumbleroot are nearly impossible. Leave them be. <br>
Treah and Fayl are the more reasonable of treants. They usually take about 25-30 players. Having enough clerics and tanks is vital when fighting these mobs. Also, before you attack them, be sure to have cleared the majority of the sylvan protectors/entolling mobs. It's usually best to fight Treah and Fayl immediately after you kill the PoGs. Having additional adds during combat will seriously hamper your chances of defeating these treants.<br><br>

Named mobs - Not sure if they're mezzable or not. Usually drop a piece of armor. These mobs are on the West side of the lake and aren't that hard.<br>
---------------<br>
Galiel Swiftfoot - Random arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm, gauranteed (looks like a large Rolling Plains Steed)<br>
Sarik the Fang - Random arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm, gauranteed (looks like a large Spirit Flux Wolf)<br>
Grohl Strongback - Random arms/bracer/boots/gauntlets/helm, gauranteed (looks like a large Sanguine Kodiak)<br><br>

Misc Info <br><br>
-None of the mobs in this zone see invis EXCEPT for the four giant treants, the quest NPCs, agitated forest spirits, and the treants near Tunare's tree (and Prince Thirnig and Tunare, obviously)<br><br>. 
-IMPORTANT: Sometimes when you're fighting protectors of growth, they "disappear" (it's some sort of bug,almost like gating, but with no text) and will return to their spawn point. Since they agro anything in the zone that's KoS and non-invis, the injured PoG will begin to summon people in your raid group and will kill you one at a time. To fix this, you must camp out immediately. Do NOT log back in, you must wait about 5-10 minutes before you log back in. This is so that the protector will have a chance to heal up so it won't be able to summon you. Casters, if bound near the tree in Wakening Lands, can gate. <br><br>
-All the mobs in this zone, save maybe the named mobs and the named treants, are on a 24-hour spawn time. 
-The drop rate in this zone is painful. Don't expect to get loot your first time (or your second or third times as well). I spent 2 weeks there, until my 13th night when 2 bard boots and 2 bard gloves dropped. <br><br>
-Be ready to have extra bags for all the spells. Improved Invisibility drops like 8 times a night. =) <br>
-Two kills and you're KoS to all of the Plane of Growth and the continent of Fadwyer (Kelethin and Felwithe).<br><br>

Thanks goes out to the creator of the map which I have used so many times in this guide. You have no idea how much it's helped me understand this zone.<br>
Thanks to the guild Hypnotic for allowing me to pull on their many successful PoG raids. <br>
(disclaimer: I don't mind you putting this on your website, just be sure to give all the credit to me, as I spent all night working on it. =P ) <br>
