She is the mother of the maelstrom.<br>
The mother of life.<br>
With immeasurable power in her hands<br>
She drinks a thousand shipwrecks.<br>
Yet, I would go back, Yes I would go back again.<br><br>

She is Mystery. Able to destroy on a whim.<br>
Countless ships lay in her belly,<br>
A testament to her wrath.<br>
Yet she can whisper to you across the waves of the ages.<br>
I would go back, Yes I would go back again.<br><br>

She beckons me daily awaiting my return<br>
But I do not fear or tremble<br>
For I know the Master of the sea<br>
I have seen the caress of his hand assuage her fury once again.<br>
I will go back, Yes I will go back again.<br><br><br>
