A Long December - Counting Crows (from cd 'Recovering the satelites')

pretty correct to me. if you have any correction, please mail them to
me. grtz. STF.


intro: F Bb Gm Bb F Bb Gm

Bb       F                  C            Gm
A long December and there's reason to believe
      Bb                F               Bb
Maybe this year will be better than the last
  Gm      Bb         F                   C  
I can't remember the last thing that you said
            Gm  
as you were leavin'
        F             Bb
Now the days go by so fast
         F               Bb         Gm    Bb
And it's one more day up in the canyons
         F                 Bb       Gm    Bb
And it's one more night in Hollywood
       F                  Bb        Gm -stop-           F  
If you think that I could be forgiven...I wish you would
  Bb   Gm  Bb ....
nanananananananana..

The smell of hospitals in winter
And the feeling that it's all a lot of oysters, but no pearls
All at once you look across a crowded room
To see the way that light attaches to a girl

And it's one more day up in the conyons
And it's one more night in Hollywood
If you think you might come to California...I think you should

Drove up to the Hillside Manor sometime after two a.m.
And talked a little while about the year
I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower
Makes you talk a little lower about
the things you could not show her

And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe
Maybe this year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself
To hold on to these moments as they pass

And it's been one more day up in the canyon
And it's one more night in Hollywood
It's been so long since I've seen the ocean...I guess I should

A Long December
by The Counting Crows
from Recovering The Satellites
brought to you by Tony Donato and Sal Ferrarello

NOTE:  This is A Long December in a different key than already exists
in the file by Michael A. Mazur.  I find this key easier to play in and
it
still sounds great.

[C]A long [G]December and there's [D]reason to [Am]believe
Maybe [C]this year will be [G]better than the [C]last
[C]I can't [G]remember the last thing that you [D]said as you were
[Am]leavin'
Now the [C]days go [G]by so [C]fast
And it's [G]one more day up [C]in the can[Am]yons
And it's [G]one more night [C]in Hollywood[Am]
If you [G]think that I could [C]be for[Am]given...I wish you would
[Chorus:  G C Am D   G C Am]

[C]The smell of [G]hospitals in [D]winter
And the [Am]feeling that it's [C]all a lot of [G]oysters, but no
[C]pearls
All at [G]once you look [D]across a crowded [Am]room
To see the [C]way that light [G]attaches to a [C]girl
And it's [G]one more day up [C]in the can[Am]yons
And it's [G]one more night [C]in Hollywood[Am]
If you [G]think you might [C]come to Cali[Am]fornia...I think you should
[Chorus]

[C]Drove up to [G]Hillside Manor [D]sometime after [Am]two a.m.
And [C]talked a little [G]while about the [C]year
I guess the [G]winter makes you [D]laugh a little [Am]slower,
Makes you [C]talk a little [G]lower about the [C]things you could not
show her
And it's been a long [G]December and there's [D]reason to [Am]believe
Maybe [C]this year will be [G]better than the [C]last
I can't [G]remember all the [D]times I tried to [Am]tell my myself
To [C]hold on to these [G]moments as they [C]pass
And it's [G]one more day up [C]in the can[Am]yons
And it's [G]one more night [C]in Hollywood[Am]
It's [G]been so long since I've [C]seen the ocean[Am]...I guess I should
[Chorus]
