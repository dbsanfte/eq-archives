 <P> Hey everyone. Thank you for taking the time to visit Echor Gwendon's website. I just wanted to let everyone know that the site is getting some new updates. 
 <P> Many thanks to Billakin who set up the new guild forums for us. You can visit the guild forums by clicking either on this link <a href="http://s4.invisionfree.com/echorgwendon" target="none">Echor Gwendon Forums</a> or by clicking on the link in the menu on the left of the site. The link isn't there yet though since I have to run over to my next class before the bell rings again so use the link above.
 <P> Thank you,
 <BR>Caldiar

 <P> Hi again everyone. Due to the fact that almost no one visits the site anymore I have sent the whole website back to our original host www.eqguild.net.  I am now using the server this was once on to host my own website for my game developing group I'm starting. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to email me at caldiar@eqguild.net
<BR> Good Hunting and Have Fun Echor Gwendon =)

 <P>Hi everyone. I'm very sorry that I haven't been able to update the guild website for the past month or two. I have been struggling with getting on the computer. Anyways, now that I'm back I will try to do as much as I can with the site and on EverQuest. I hope to see some of you online sometime soon. 
<P>I have deleted the rest of the entries to save some space. I will save them in a seperate file on my computer in case someone wants to see them sometime later on. 
<P>Remember, any suggestions for the website or comments in general are always welcome. If you have any questions please email me at caldiar@eqguild.net . 
<P> Good Hunting Echor Gwendon,
<BR> Caldiar
