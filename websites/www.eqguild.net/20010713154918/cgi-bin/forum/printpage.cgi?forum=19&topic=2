        The members being listed on the website all have long titles that are meant to be fun. Things like <b>Most-Honored Cave Warden</b>, <b>Honored Servent of Brell</b>, <b>Guzzler of Firewater</b>, etc. <br> <br>Let me know what you'd like your titles to be!

        Is this a title we pick for ourselves? <br>For example: <br>Kikya - Most Vigilant Leg Biter <br>?? :biggrin:  <br> <br>Or is it a title that we will get from another smurf? <br>Just wondering :) <br> <br>---------------------- <br>Kikya <br>Warrior of the 19th season

        Either way; an initial title that grows as other people add things to it :).
