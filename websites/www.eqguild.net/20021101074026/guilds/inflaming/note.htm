  stood looking upon the great expanse of the lands beyond the gates of mighty
  Kaladim. My sword and cloth tunic gave me a small measure of confidence. These
  were intangible things that I knew would not betray me. Over the nearest hills,
  I could hear the sounds of the wild, caught glimpses of things both dangerous
  and wonderful. Untamed lands beyond what I knew as my home lay before me. What
  was I doing here? Where was I to go? Uncertainty began to wrap me in it's warm,
  constricting embrace. Then, it was broken. "Which way do you want to go
  Grudger? I say we follow the trail left, where Gaiayn showed us. You remember
  don't you, the Cross-Roads? Let's race!"</font></i></p>

  of us have felt the excitement of starting their first character. For those of
  us that had friends who played EQ before us, we received one warning over and
  over, "You will die a lot!” For those of us that learned the basics
  through reading the EQ books, we received one warning over and over, "You
  will die a lot!” For many of us, this was a frightening thing. We were told
  that our "corpse" would rot and disappear, taking all of our precious
  items along with it and to "never lose your body!" We were cautious,
  we ran to the guards like lost children in a Supermarket. Everything seamed so
  BIG! When we looted a slain foe and discovered that “there is a rusty
  longsword on this skeleton!” It was as good as an Epic Item to a level 60
  character…we didn’t care…we were having FUN! I try and keep this feeling
  alive in my game play, and believe it is why so many people find the game as
  entrancing as it is...</span></font></p>
