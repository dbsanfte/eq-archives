After a pretty good wipeout, we had a pretty good day in Chardok today. I picked up a <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1167" target="_blank">Arcane Sarnak Fetish</a> and a few bubbles of experience. Luckily I had to log as Saldir got there, I couldn't stand the stench of Inky. - Mahd

Kael yet again was camped out, so we headed back to Kedge to see if we could learn more. Phinny was down, so we decided to head to his hole and try the other seahorses for practice. After a minor incident on the way down (invis dropping can be such a pain) we formed up on the ledge. We managed a couple of single  swirlspine pulls, but then unfortunately we got 2, and despite our best efforts we were unable to split them far enough apart to stop them from complete healing each other. Evac was called after a long fight, and we left with lives intact. Given the smallish force, and the classes present we had a good show.

Split raid events today. One small group was invited on a Hate raid, so now our clerics are starting to turn purple (one from the armour - grats to Sackerthyth on your new <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2431" target="_blank">Ethereal Mist Vambraces</a> 
 - the others from jealousy). The main groups headed to Kedge Keep. We had in the past done quite a good job of avoiding this location, but finally we bit the bullet. We settled quite well near the entrance and proceded to clear the sharks and mermaids. Teamwork was good, and nobody drowned. Phinny was up, and eventually caution was thrown to the wind and we made our way down to his home. The seahorses were disposed of without any deaths and finally phinny himself filled our screens. Unfortunately a mistimed repop meant we got a swirlspine add along with the guardian seahorses. Phinny wins this round.

In a way only Omerta can possibly understand, our plans for Kael were abandoned - something bigger and better turned up: Hate. 
Breaking the Plane of Hate was summed up perfectly by Rinaldi 
<BR>'I knew I was in trouble when I saw my cleric flying through the air like a muppet'.
<BR>Had some really excellent wipeouts and a great atmosphere as the mobs, and ourselves went down.
Congratulation to Rikera on her 
<a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3672" target="_blank">Wand of Conflagration </a> and Ariasong on a book for her Ragebringer Quest.
<BR>Thanks to Laberdere for the invite, Four Elements, Mystic Healers, Socratic Method, Povar-Tarew Artisans and The Well (too many of you to mention) for a really great evening.

Quest day
<BR>After a successful CR from hell we spent a little time questing as a guild. A trip to Mistmoore was successful two-fold, Carneas got some SOW boots for her epic from the Dire Wolf and we repaired some damaged Ring of Scale faction from a previous raid in Burning Woods. We also spent some time in Kaesora obtaining more Zalgoz fangs in preparation for a future trip to Howling Stones before heading for a brief trip to Kael, which yielded some nice loot, including 5 gems for pieces of Velious armour.

A number of Omertians headed to the arena area in Kael Drakkel. In total 3 fairly full groups participated.  We managed to kill about 15 of the arena troopers and veterans before the need for sleep for most people involved cut short our adventures.  No corroded armor drops - but all in all a very strong showing by Omerta and friends.  Not one death drung the raid proper - though running to WL seems more hazardous than actually raiding in Kael. Congratulations to all the helpers on the raid - especially Juliears and Umble, clerics extrordinaire.

Couple of us tagged along to a Laberdere led Nagafen raid. After a lot of waiting, buffing and fretting we were successful in defeating her. Congratulations to Tignous for a book for his epic and to Skarrad on her Cloak of Flames.

Breiz, Korudan and Darkzero represented Omerta as we tried to help Restless Circle kill Ixiblat Fer and the nasty sea dragon Faydedar for a couple of their members' epics.  Ixiblat went down, though his riposte disc took down a lot of the very fast attack speed tanks.  Fay was not quite as easy, and a poor spawn of the dragon into the middle of all the seated casters in the raid spelled trouble - and bad aggro crontrol sealed the issue - with a wipeout and long CR to follow.  Thanks to RC for the invite to help out - was good Ubermob experience for our memebers.

  This has been a busy time with the Halloween events this year running for a number of days. Many people in the guild have been busy in the East Karana and Rathe Mountain events killing new monsters. The <a href="BloodReaver.jpg" target="_blank">Blood Reaver</a> in particular in Rathe Mountains was spectacular. All October news has been archived in the <a href="oldnews.html" target="_self">Old News</a> area.
