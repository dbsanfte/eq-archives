			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Be nice to people. The guild has its own reputation to keep and you are our ambassador. You will be kicked from the guild if you are caught being antisocial by killstealing, campstealing, intentionally training people etc. Also, 'Roleplaying' an evil character does not give you carte blanche to engage in such behaviour just because you're 'evil'.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Your guild tag must be visible at all times. Going /anon hides your tag, and the only reason we can think of for doing this is because you are engaged in activities you don't wish the guild to know about (camp stealing etc), or you are hiding from your guild. If you need to hide your class/level, use /roleplay instead.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Don't beg for stuff. Requests in guildchat for people to give you money, items, powerlevelling or other twinking will result in action being taken. It's ok to offer people money, equipment, etc, but it is up to the giver, not the potential receiver.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">If a guildmate gives you an item for free, that is something gifted to you by the guild and should be passed back to the guild when you get something better or can no longer use it. Do not sell it. Pass it on to someone who can use it or the guild quartermaster.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">All new recruits (and existing members who haven't got around to it) are expected to sign up for the web forum and add their character to the guild roster.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Help your guildmates. If someone asks for help in guildchat, for a messy corpse retrieval or for quest help for example, try to come to their aid if at all possible. What goes around comes around - when you need your corpse pulled out of a lava flow people will remember if you helped them before. Conversely, if people can't come that minute, don't take it personally and try to respect their time - they are here to play too.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">Don't treat porters like a taxi service. Requests for things like ports and binds in guildchat are ok, but if noone responds, please take that to mean noone is available and &lt;gasp&gt; maybe try to buy one from a passerby in your zone. Don't spam guildchat about it. In particular, if you need a port to a raid or other guild event we will try to help but it is your own responsibility to be at the meeting point on time - latecomers should make their own arrangements for ports since asking guildmates to pick you up will take them away from the raid, even if said druid or wizard got there themself in good time. Non porting classes should aim to be at the nearest wizard spire or druid ring about 30min before a published raid start time if they are hoping for a guildmate to transport them.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li type="disc"><font face="Verdana,Arial,MS Sans Serif,SunSans-Regular" size="-1">If you get something you don't need, consider giving it to the guild (or at least selling it to a guildmate at a reduced rate). If you get a nice item that your class can't use, what is better - making a small pile of plat, or helping a guildmate who could use the item? If some nodrop thing you can't use turns up in the course of your travels, what is better - letting it rot, or helping a guildmate who can use it by multiquesting with them?<br>
