          guild in Karana server. We use english chat and we have members from all around the globe.
          Our raiding times most of the time are from <em>5pm GMT/12pm EST</em> to <em>1am GMT/8pm
          EST</em>. We are currently allied with Skyshrine (CoV faction) and Thurgadin. We are part
          of the Karana Guild Central (KGC)</font></small></p>

          you come into contact with, remember that your actions always represent the guild as a
          whole. We are stronlgy against Kill Stealing and training (this does not include our

          compulsary, but some (eg epic) you must attend if your online. It would be appreciated if
          you could attend as many as possible while you are online. While on a raid, listen to the
          raid leader and pullers, and follow their instructions.</font></small></p>

          <p><small><font face="Century Gothic"><font color="#FFFFFF">If you require help with an
          epic mob or hel</font>p getting an item, think that we have over 100 people in this guild,
          the majority of which are 50+ so some patience is going to have to be given as not just
          you will want something done. The more people you help, the more chance you have of those
          people helping you in return. Never give up on something and always have faith, if
          something turns bad during a raid learn from it and have patience. Some of the raids might
          be level restricted depending of the nature and the difficulty of them (eg +55 for ToV),
          we all have our chances in the future. </font></small></p>

          <p><small><font face="Century Gothic">We keep guildchat open minded (our /gu is rated PG
          +18 most of the time), but it is not a channel for moaning about loot. During guild
          events, /gu should be kept to a minimum. Disputes between members should be carried out in
          <strong>tells</strong> and not in guildchat. </font></small></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p align="”justify”"><small><font face="Century Gothic">The majority of loot on a
          guild raid will be given out in an 'award' fashion. TSW has a dedicated Loot Master who
          keeps track of everything given out on guild raids, along with notes on attendance, to
          work out who should be awarded what items. </font></small></p>
          <p><small><font face="Century Gothic">In the instance of a item which will not be used by
          a main present, it is lotto'ed for whatever purpose - in some cases, items are held to be
          sold to fund the guild bank. </font></small></p>
          <p><small><font face="Century Gothic">In the case where you receive an upgrade to a non no
          drop item, it would be appreciated, but not expected, for you to hand down your previous
          item. </font></small></p>
          <p><small><font face="Century Gothic"><u>General etiquette on raids:</u> </font></small><ul>
            <li><small><font face="Century Gothic">Don’t spam /gu for stats, they will be announced </font></small></li>
            <li><small><font face="Century Gothic">Don’t madly try and check a mobs corpse - group
              leaders only are responsible for reporting items and looting non no drop loot or cash
              items. </font></small></li>
            <li><small><font face="Century Gothic">Have patience, and your time will eventually come. </font></small></li>
          </ul>
          <p><small><font face="Century Gothic">This system is built on trust, and has worked well
          for a long time now. If you do have a problem with a decision made on a raid, take it up
          with the loot master at the end of the raid, not during it. Note, that for new members
          joining the guild still within their probation month, they will generally not be
          considered for loot over a primary who needs the item </font></small></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><small><font face="Century Gothic">To apply for membership in The Silent Watch, you
          need the following.</font></small><ul>
            <li><small><font face="Century Gothic">Have a sponsor within the guild</font></small></li>
            <li><small><font face="Century Gothic">Minimum level to join TSW is <strong>55</strong></font></small></li>

          </ul>
          <p><small><font face="Century Gothic">It is wise not be guilded while you apply for
          membersip in TSW. If you have the above requirements then you can post in 'Applying to
          join' forum and your application will be moved to the private section of our message board
          for consideration from our members. Prior to this an interview with the recruting officer
          and class leader will be arranged. In the period of one month you need to gather <strong>15</strong>
          positive votes, we strongly suggest to group with TSW members so that will get to know you
          and you know them. Also you can contact your sponsor to find information about upcoming
          events and raids.&nbsp; If you have any negative votes during that period we will look
          into the situation and extend the evaluation period if needed. If your application is
          rejected you can re-apply after the period of two months.</font></small></p>
          <p><small><font face="Century Gothic">Once you are invited you will have a probationary
          status of one month. GL and Officers will be able to evaluate your overall contribution to
          the guild. During this period priority on loot will be given to full members <em>(eg. ToV
          BP drops,&nbsp; cleric and&nbsp; warrior (prob. satus) need the BP, the BP will be awarded
          to the cleric</em>). This also applies when it comes to epic items/raids, full TSW members
          will have priority over a spawn or an epic item as long as they want the specific
          item/spawn <em>(eg. RF spawns, X cleric and Y cleric (prob. status) need it to finish
          their epics, X cleric is unable to camp RF, Y cleric will get all the help he/she needs to
          complete the epic)</em>. At the end of this one month probationary status you will be
          considered a Full Member or rejected. </font></small></p>
          <p><small><font face="Century Gothic">Special cases may apply and an applicant will be
          considered without having to go through the full application process, this is up to GL and
          officers.</font></small></p>
