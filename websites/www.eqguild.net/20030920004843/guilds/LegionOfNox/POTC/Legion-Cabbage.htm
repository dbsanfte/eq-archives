 <p><font color="#666699">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> After reviewing the <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/potc_intro.htm">Protection
 of the Cabbage Quest</a>, many of us decided we wanted to commit our time and
 abilities to produce items for the POTC quest as a team.&nbsp; The reward is an
 extremely nice.&nbsp; Anyone can use the <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12456">Earring
 of the Solstice</a>, and druid's can choose between that or Xanthe's <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12455">Earring
 of Nature</a>.&nbsp; Please note:&nbsp; <i>This is different from the spell
 version of the quest.</i></b></font></p>
 <p><font color="#666699"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To say this is a
 tradeskill-intensive quest would be an understatement.&nbsp; We need the
 services of folks who have or are working toward a 250 in the following
 skills:&nbsp; </b></font></p>
 <ul style="color: #33CCCC" type="square">
   <li><b><font color="#009999">Baking</font></b></li>
   <li><b><font color="#009999">Brewing</font></b></li>
   <li><b><font color="#009999">Fishing (200)</font></b></li>

 </ul>
 <p><font color="#666699"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, so fishing isn't
 considered a tradeskill...&nbsp; &lt;Tries to track down her train of
 thought&gt;&nbsp; Well, we need at least 1 Grand Master for each of these
 tradeskills (er, and fishing.)&nbsp; <i>Multiple Grand Masters for a specific
 would be great!</i>&nbsp; There's plenty of work to do for this quest.&nbsp; The
 more folks that can help, the easier this will be for all involved.&nbsp; I've
 posted a <a href="http://www.eqguild.net/guilds/LegionOfNox/POTC/POTC-Basic.htm">Breakdown
 of the POTC Quest</a> so we can all get a basic idea of what's involved at a
 glance.&nbsp; Ok, so it's a rather long glance, hehehe....</b></font></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><font color="#666699"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you lack a passion for
 tradeskills, but would skill like to help (and would really like the cool
 earring&lt;g&gt;,) there's plenty of stuff we'll need to do before any combining
 can even start!&nbsp; We'd really appreciate any assistance you can give.&nbsp;
 There are some recipe components that can only be obtained by fighting, e.g.,
 lotus sap and/or leaves dropped by deep cavern lotuses in FG and brownie parts
 dropped by...well, brownies!&nbsp; At times, we'll need people willing to port
 folks to various locations, people who can forage in specific zones, folks
 willing to collect and/or purchase 39+ spell research components for celestial
 essence (which ANYONE can make and is no-fail), ect...</b></font></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><b><font color="#666699">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Legion has many friends
 in Norrath, through allied guilds and through the friends of individual
 members.&nbsp; We may very well need to seek the assistance of these friends,
 but we want to start from within.&nbsp; So here's what we need anyone
 interesting in helping to do right now:</font></b></p>

     POST to the POTC folder in <a href="http://www.guildportal.com/guildforums.asp?GuildID=860">our
     forum here</a>.&nbsp; Please READ the initial message and then post as a
     reply.&nbsp; Once we get an idea of who's willing
     to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help (which also means who
     wants the earring), we'll start organizing this massive undertaking,
     breaking it down into bite-sized, manageable pieces.&nbsp; We don't want any
     one person to end up overwhelmed with work.&nbsp; Make sure to include all
     the info asked for.&nbsp; If you don't know something, just say so :)&nbsp;
     No worries, we'll get it all straightened out eventually!</font></b></li>

 <p><b><font color="#666699">If you have any questions, you can also post to the
 POTC folder.&nbsp; Just start a new thread, please.&nbsp; Take care, and we'll
 all be talking soon! :)</font></b></p>
