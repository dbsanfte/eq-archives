 <font color="#FFFFFF">A few guidelines we have for our guild.&nbsp; These
 are things that I disliked about the last few guilds I was in, so I decided
 that I would make my own guild and fix the things that I saw as wrong.</font>
 <p><font color="#FFFF00">Guideline #1: Officers and Leader (Kortap) receive
 no special treatment.&nbsp; I would not want people bowing before them
 like they are kings.&nbsp; They are just normal people.&nbsp; They just
 have the privilege of being officers.</font>
 <p><font color="#FFFF00">Guideline #2:&nbsp; We do not use the /anon command
 to go anonymous.&nbsp; We use the /roleplay command so that all can still
 see the guild behind your name.&nbsp; I figure what's the point in being
 in the guild if you are going to hide that fact from everyone else.&nbsp;
 We need to advertise!!!</font>
 <p><font color="#FFFF00">Guideline #3:&nbsp; All local problems and issues
 stay in local chat.&nbsp; No spamming the guildchat with useless prattle
 that should stay within the group you are in or the person you are talking
 to.&nbsp; Guildchat is for talking to all of your fellow guild members.&nbsp;
 Treat them with respect by not overusing guildchat.</font>
 <p><font color="#FFFF00">Guideline #4:&nbsp; We have among our members
 some skilled traders.&nbsp; If you wish to purchase something from them,
 you pay for the materials (unless of course they offer it for free).&nbsp;
 They donate their time, don't make them donate their money as well.&nbsp;
 DONATIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE!!</font>
 <p><font color="#FFFF00">Guideline #5:&nbsp; We do not remove members often,
 but if we need to, a vote of all people in the guild who are online at
 the time decides your fate.&nbsp; Majority wins.</font><font color="#FFFF00"></font>
 <p><font color="#FFFF00">Guideline #6:&nbsp; Everyone's opinion in this
 guild matters.&nbsp; I take all suggestions to heart before I act on them.&nbsp;
 So if you ever have a suggestion, please don't hesitate to talk to me.</font>
 <br>&nbsp;
 <p><font color="#FFFF00">We offer a 15 day trial period for new recruits.&nbsp;
 During those 15 days you must group with one of our members so that we
 can get a feel for how you play.&nbsp; If you decide during that time that
 this is not the guild for you, you can leave at any time with no problems.&nbsp;
 If you stay, and we like you, then you are a full fledged member.&nbsp;
 I am also very liberal with my officerships, so don't rule out being one!</font>
 <br>&nbsp;
 <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Still interested?&nbsp; Then email me (Kortap)
 at the link below, and I'll see about getting you in.&nbsp; Please be sure
 to include your in game name, times that you will be on and your hunting
 locations so I can set something up.&nbsp; Also include level, class and
 race for my reference.</font>
