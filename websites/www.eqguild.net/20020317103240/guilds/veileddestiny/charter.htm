<blockquote>
Veiled Destiny is a group of people who come together for a common cause. 
We are a close group of friends and a tight family unit, and as a family
we all work together for the good and the betterment of each other's playing time
on Everquest so that everyone has fun as they level within the game after all we
belive that the sole reason anyone plays a game is to have fun.
<br>
<br>

We defend each other and help each other when able without any thought 
of personal gain. In essence, the members of Veiled Destiny are a 
unified power.  The Members of Veiled Destiny are very close to each other,
and it is because of this tight bonding and the overall agreement that quality and not
quantity makes a powerful guild Veiled keeps its numbers of members lower then many similar 
guilds... 
<br>
We get to know all of the members and we all share in the achievements and dissapointments of each other.
<br>
<br>
We believe everyone's action and attitude is a reflection on themselves.. Cussing is not allowed in guild chat and NEVER is it permitted in open zone ooc or Shout as this definately reflects negative on the guild as a whole.
