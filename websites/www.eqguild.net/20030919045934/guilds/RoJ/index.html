Events are coming up in the near future, so please register for the events on the member's webpage <a href="http://www.webguilder.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>This Saturday(5/4/02) we will be going to Maiden's Eye.  This event will be limited to ONE group only.  There are some excellent drops in this zone, but it is quite dangerous as well.  Target will be to gather some of those elusive high level druid spells to help out the many members who could benefit from them.  An e-mail has been sent out to many members with the pertinent information and links;  and, the event is posted on the Events section of our member's page.<p>
<p>My apologies for the most recent exploratory raid into Karnor's Castle.  A very bad connection coupled by less than perfect organization by myself (and the constant trains on the day of the event) led to a rather poor experience for the guild.  I apologize wholeheartedly to all members involved.</p>
<p>A successful exploratory raid of Karnor's Castle was conducted by a full group of Guild Members on Saturday, March 30, 2002.  The event was quite successful, and the zone seems to be a good place to get some excellent experience.  Though perhaps the best loot dropped was a star ruby, there seemed to be rather common drops of fine steel weaponry.  The rare drops in the zone, though we did not see them in this particular raid, are indeed excellent.  I think this is a place the guild will visit quite often in the future.  Special thanks to all those who participated in the raid!</p>

<p>The Tower of Frozen Shadow Raid, while it had some bumps along the way, was rather successful!  An update of the raid events will be posted in the near future.  On a side note, I have now been banned from weekend play by my girlfriend, so I do apologize for having to leave such an enjoyable raid, and having to forgo future weekend raids.<br>


<p>Officers please note: <b>YOU have the ability to set guild events on our members page!</b>  Take advantage of this opportunity to schedule some interesting experiences for our guildmembers!</p>

All Guild members should have the ability to access the "News" section of the member site (ie, you can post news items).  Please use this tool in order post any assistance you may need for personal quests, etc. </p>

<p>Also, if signing up for a guild event, bring along a friend.  If each participant brings a friend or two, it will not only increase our own status, but it might convince good people to come and try out the Reavers.</p>

<p>In order to fully construct the webpage and in order to present the most accurate information for the guild, please e-mail me the name of your main character and alts in the guild at <a href="mailto:troykramer@hotmail.com">troykramer@hotmail.com</a>. I will be sending you an e-mail in return for an additional webpage link where you will be asked to update your character information(ie level, class, race, etc) <a href="http://www.webguilder.com">here</a>.  Please note that you will not be able to log into the above link until you get your username and password from me, via e-mail.  If you are uncomfortable or unable to send me an e-mail, simply send me a tell in-game (or Sanelan) and we'll have one set up for you!  Please also e-mail me or post under the news section of the member site regarding any events or quests you would like the guild to participate in.  Remember, we are here to help each other out, so if you're eyeing that special quest item, let us all know so we can help you get it!  Also, while the webpage is still in the very raw stages, please send me your comments on what you would like to see here, so that I can figure out a way to incorporate it.</p></font></p><br><br>
