<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Sorry for the long delay in web site updates
- real life been extremely busy.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I know we have many new faces running around
Norrath, and to all of you - <B>WELCOME</B>. Naldiien has expressed his
desire to be on an "Invite freeze" right now. We are a family guild, and
we need to take the time to get to know everyone before we grow more. From
past experiences, growing too fast is a bad thing.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">So, my request to all of you, get together
and hunt as a group. If you see someone on about the same level as you
that you may not know, or barely know, make an effort to go group with
that person. We are a family, we need to act like one, and do things together.
Not just the big raids, but everything - camping those items, getting experience,
or just plain messing around. <B>Go out there and make JJKR what is should
be, not just one of the uber guilds, but the biggest, best family in Norrath.&nbsp;</B>
This will not happen on its own, we must <B>ALL</B> make the <B><U>effort</U></B>
to achieve this goal.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Now, I am doing some web site updates.
I am adding a page "Family Photo Album" for all those screen shots we have,
and would like to share. If you have some, get them to me (Prefer jpg or
gif) and I will put them up. Please provide some information about the
photo - when, where, a caption, ...</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I will also be working on a roster section.
I hope to be able to include character photos.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The message board is up, and running -
just click on the link to the left. It will open up the message board in
a separate window (Or it should, if I did everything right :). Please feel
free to use it. With the section on raids, I will check it, and, when we
have a raid scheduled there, I will try to get it included on Everquestraids.com
chart, if its not already there.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">26 April,&nbsp; 2001</FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">It brings me great pleasure to announce
the emergence of the powerful guild &lt;Ju Jin Kai Reborn>.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Like the phoenix, out of the ashes of the
fallen Ju Jin Kai Clan, the Ju Jin Kai Reborn emerges to claim it's position
amongst the powerhouse guilds on the Tarew Marr server.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I will be cleaning up, and adding to this
web site as time goes on, but I wanted to get it up for now. Please help
me make the best out of this web page, and send me stories, screen shots,
RL photos, ...&nbsp; Anything you would like to share with the guild.</FONT>
