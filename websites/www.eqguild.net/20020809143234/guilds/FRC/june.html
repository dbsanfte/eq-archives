              <blockquote>This is a slow week, for news about Fennin Ro, there 
                is an invasion tour going on, you can find more information about 
                it at <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com" target=_"blank">Casters 
                Realm</a> :) Also I did some changes too the webpage made Quests 
                its own page, instead of listing them in another table :) and 
                the links in EQ Links should open in another window. Hope it looks 
                better!</blockquote>

				 After you have finished patching (make sure auto-play is not ticked), before you hit Play go to your EverQuest 
				 folder and delete the eqnews.txt file. Then go back to your patcher and hit Play.<br>
                 Do not exit the patcher while you delete the file or you will get the bugged eqnews.txt file re-downloaded.<br></blockquote>

                    One of the things I have been thinking about adding to 
                      our webpage is information on quests. The most popular quests, 
                      I think is Twilight Sea armor, so I have taken the time 
                      too create our own tables for this. I hope this is easy 
                      too read, and that it helps those of you interested in these 
                      quests out :)</blockquote>
