        I know some of you already have them... the rest of you, feel free to get them. <a href="http://eqguild.net/profiles" target="_blank">http://eqguild.net/profiles</a> <br> <br>If you want a picture with yours, send me a screenshot (or tell me which one if it's in the screenshot gallery already) and I'll cut it down and upload it for you so you can add it in.

        Ohhhhh...hey will you get that picture of me immitating a rogue and chop it down to size? &nbsp;I don't have a graphics converter and all my screenshots are *.bmp and too large.

        hehe...the caption is "Lilla"...it's EQ000083.jpg &nbsp; <br> <br>It's already in jpg form but was wondering if it should be cropped to cut the "dead space" before uploading it to a profile.
