      <P></P>
      <P>1. One person will be designated as the only looter in each group. 
      After the kill they will immediately loot the corpse and call out in /ooc 
      the contents of corpse to include negative contents. It is paramount that 
      this is immediate as to avoid decay of items. If you are the looter, the 
      only exception to this is when you get the kill on a mob that may drop 
      your class specific armor. DO NOT loot your class mobs. When this happens 
      you will designate a person (of a different class) to loot the corpse and 
      the above procedure will then apply to them for the contents of this 
      mob.</P>
      <P>2. All rolls on items will be based on a random roll with a range of 
      numbers decided in advance by the raid leader(s). People will be 
      designated to give calls for rolls and classes affected, and only those 
      designated as such shall make these calls. This is to prevent erroneous 
      looting.</P>
      <P>3. Rare Gems (i.e. Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, Jacinth, etc) will be held 
      by one designated person until the end of raid. At this time the group 
      leaders will roll for the gems. The winners will then in turn take the 
      group back and do rolls among the group for the loot. If the group leader 
      wins more than one, the group member that wins one is out of the next 
      group roll, until everyone in the group has won. In the event that one or 
      more person must leave the raid early, the rare gems collected thus far 
      shall be rolled for in the above manner, and this shall be repeated at 
      each such juncture. This rule final part of this rule may be made 
      exception to in such cases as that those leaving have only been present 
      for a short time, or other unforeseen circumstance.</P>
      <P>4. Cash Loot: (i.e. Ruby Crown, Plat Emerald Ring, etc.) will be held 
      by one designated person. At the end of raid the cash loot will be divided 
      evenly among the clerics as to compensate for cost of buffing components. 
      If one or more cleric needs to leave at a point before the raid ends, the 
      cash loot collected thus far should be distributed at that point. In the 
      event that there is not enough cash loot to distribute to all the clerics, 
      the raid leader(s) should decide on a manner in which to randomly decide 
      the distribution.</P>
      <P>5. Class Armor: You are entitled to win only one piece of class armor 
      until all of your class has a piece. What does this mean to you? You need 
      to decide if you want to roll on the bracer and take a chance that the BP 
      will not drop. On the other hand, if all present pass on an item, it will 
      then be decided by open roll and only in a case such as this will this 
      piece not count towards class armor and the winner allowed to roll on the 
      next drop. (shields are included as class armor)</P>
      <P>6. Weapons: Will be rolled on by classes that can use the weapon and 
      are not counted towards any other type of rolls. The manner of rolling for 
      weapons shall follow the same rules applied to class armor, though 
      considered separately from those, categorically.</P>
      <P>7. Epic items: These are always class specific open roll, regardless of 
      previous winnings unless otherwise stated (i.e. going for the specific 
      purpose of helping a person to complete the epic quest)</P>
      <P>8. God Loot: This is also always class specific open roll, regardless 
      of previous winnings, unless otherwise stated (i.e. going for the specific 
      purpose of helping a person to complete the epic quest)</P>
      <P>9. A guild wishing to become a a member of the GC must have at least 
      one level 50 or higher character within it's ranks. If eligible, the 
      Guildleader shall post an application for membership on the GC's general 
      discussion board. This application should include basic guild information 
      and a list of names of 50-plus members so that eligibility may be 
      verified. A GC Representative will verify in game the prospective guild's 
      eligibility, and will post an acceptance of the application. Once the 
      application has been accepted, the prospective guild is urged to attend as 
      many of the scheduled GC raids as possible, so that they may be evaluated 
      for membership. The evaluation process will take place over a period of 
      thirty days starting on the date the application was accepted. After the 
      30 day period has expired, a vote shall be called in the GC Reps forum, 
      with a two-thirds majority required for membership. Upon a successful 
      vote, the guild will be considered a probationary member for a period of 
      sixty days from the date of the vote. During this period, a Guild Rep will 
      be appointed, and the new member guild may voice issues, but will have no 
      vote in GC matters. If any questions arise during the probationary period, 
      another vote may be called by any full GC member guild for removal / 
      affirmation. Again a two-thirds majority shall carry the vote. Otherwise, 
      once the sixty day period has passed the Guild shall be considered a full 
      member with all the rights and privileges of any other member.</P>
      <P>10. Any Guild may call for a removal vote of any other member guild. 
      Should this occur, a two-week investigation period shall begin, allowing 
      the charges to be posted, the accused guild to post a defense, and the 
      facts investigated by all member guilds. At the conclusion of the 
      investigation period a vote shall be held in the Reps forum, with a 
      three-fourths majority required for removal.</P>
      <P>11. Individuals that act inappropriately may recieve a warning 
      following a vote of the GC reps to issue such warning based upon a simple 
      majority vote. If a warning is issued, such warning shall be done through 
      the individual's GC Rep. If several warnings have been issued to the same 
      individual, the Reps may vote to ban that individual from further GC 
      sponsored events, again by majority vote. Notification of such banning 
      will be delivered by the individual's Rep.</P>
      <P>12. Anytime that a vote needs to be made, the call to vote shall be 
      posted in the reps forum. A one-week period will be allowed from the 
      initial post for all Reps to cast their votes. At the end of the week, the 
      votes shall be tallied and results announced. If a member guild does not 
      vote, it will be assumed that they have abstained, and their vote will not 
      be included in the final tally.</P>
      <P>13. Raid leaders must be familiar with GC loot rules, and insure that 
      anyone assisting him/her with the raid is also familiar with said rules. 
      When assembling groups, the raid leader must ensure that each group leader 
      is also familiar with GC loot rules. Prior to the start of the raid, the 
      raid leader must announce that GC loot rules shall be in effect, and 
      answer any questions that may be brought up regarding application of the 
      rules.</P>
      <P>14. Threads within the Reps portion of the forums may never be deleted. 
      Threads within the Raids and Raid suggestions portion of the forums will 
      be deleted after 60 days have passed from the last post. Threads contained 
      in all other forums will be deleted if no longer relevant after 60 days 
      from the date of the last post. Any old posts that should be kept for 
      historical purposes should be locked to prevent accidental 
      deletion.</P>
