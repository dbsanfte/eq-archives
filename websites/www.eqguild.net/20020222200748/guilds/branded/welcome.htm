  Some things have happened recently that made me reflect on alot of things, about myself
  and those closest to me.  I'm still very excited about everything that happened and is
  happening as we speak.  Some of my other dreams are on the cusp of coming true.  
  <P>
  Gwen and I won't be getting married in game.  I'm not going to
  answer why, because that's between her and I.  Please don't ask us about what happened,
  it's really not a big deal so don't worry.  
  <P>
  Talk to you all soon, happy hunting and be safe :)

  First I'd like to welcome all the new members that we have :)  It's gr8 to log on and find so many good ppl to play/talk with :)  Thank you all for making this guild a fun place to hang :)  I myself and I'm sure some others, didn't have RL friends in game to group with and talk to when we first started.  Since then I have made some good friends in here, hope the same for you all.
  <P>
  The beautiful elven godess Gwendalyn, has accepted my hand in marriage <!--tues jan 22 --> :) I'm the luckiest guy playin EQ.  No details as yet as to time, date, place ect.  Rest assured we will give everyone advanced notice because we would love for everyone to be able to come.  We have decided that we are going to have a GM wedding.  If ye have any comments or suggestions please <A HREF="mailto:pctek@voyageur.ca">EMAIL</A> me, don't tell spam me in game, plz.
  <P>
  Everyone has been doing very well at leveling, including myself, finaly made 26 last night.  Tinvarwen, The Silent One (lol) is up to 33, our highest lvl so far :) w000t gratz bud :)
  <P>
  We had an impromptu meeting in guildsay this past saturday.  Basically just went over the leadership and reminded people about the website.  Also let everyone know that I'm not Guildleader.
  Appointed (by majority vote) Zhentor (Zait) as Assistant Raid Coordinator to Xunik.

  Hi everyone, a quick update.  Not too much went on, but there were a couple of things.  Gratz to Tinvarwen for completing another of his Lambent mail quests.  Now you're really
  gonna look smurf/blueberry muffinish ... ROFLMAO ... 
  <P>
  Blah ... just woke up so can't think ... I'll have lvl 24 today, getting that first so I can recruit in wolf-form.  Very high coolness factor ;)
  <P>
  Decided on what to do with the Robe I won the other night.  Gwendalyn is now the very proud owner of a Robe of Ishva.  Gratz hun, you deserve it for putting up with all the testosterone from the begining.  I think she looks smashing in it and it's not that dayglow, nuclear accident, find your corpse in the dark pink! LOL (pic on Callery page).

  Many new members were signed up this evening and even this morning, right as the servers were going down ;)  A warm welcome to everyone who was Branded.
  <P>
  After helping a few people earlier in the evening, Xunik and myself went in and camped the tower in back of the TR of CB.  I FINALY got the chance to have a hand in the demise of Ambassador Dvinn and loudly proclaimed our victory over this treacherous villan.
  <P>
  After this, we headed off to Split Paw where we grouped up with a number of others and handily took out some nasty customers (least to me they were).  Later in the evening not long after Xunik left (lag problems), a very generous Enchanter (can't remember his name, and Tin or Xunik if you do let me know so I can post, this person deserves anything that we can ever help him with) let our group roll for a Robe of Ishva.  My roll of 825 rocked everyone elses :p w00000000t
  <P>
  Not sure what I'm going to do with this just yet.  I'll have to give that some more thought as I'm a druid and I don't know if I want another character yet, or if it's going to be a class that can use this.
  <P>
  The history is done and uploaded, please have a read and post in msg board area.  It's not polished yet, but all things in time.  Least it's finished.
  <P>

  Mnem and Xun, hope everything is going gr8, look forward to adventuring when yas get back.
  <P>
  We have been holding little forays into different areas, on the 3rd and 4th Jaladce, Sobasik, Gwendalyn, Zait and myself went into Kerra Isle, an outdoor zone off of Toxx forest.  We all had Luclin and so decided to use the spires to go up and took the TP pad down to Odus.  Still took some time but was a fun run.
  <P>
  Once we got in Zone we split into 2 groups with Zait by himself and the others in thier own group.  Zait and I hung out by the entrance, with me pulling for him (harmony) and buffing and healing everyone as need be.  I had everyone create /guild HELP, heal me buttons so I could know when someone hit round 60% max health.  Zait and I weren't far from the others so I could run over and heal the others.
  <P>
  Decent loot here, but even better was the exp.  Zait got 2 blue bubbles per kill in this zone.  Not sure offhand how much the others got.  +20% exp bonus in this zone, I guess because the Kerrans are so fast.  Was fun to hang out.  There will be more forrays into this area in the future, good little zone for us to lvl in.  There was only one other person in there the whole time we were there.

  First general meeting and subsequent raid went off smashingly.  Xunik accepted the position of Raid Coordinator.  Confirmed that Ylushiun will be guild admin/web developer.
  <P>
  After the meeting, the raid commenced.  The first encounter was shakey with the whole party nearly getting wiped out by a train out of the throne room.  After that we camped up by the zone while Xunik pulled named MOBs out for the group.  Near as I've heard (couldn't stay for the whole night) everyone got good loot.  
  <P>
  For those that couldn't make it, this was just the first of many ... there's talk of a drunken treetop race through Kelethin, as well as team duels in the arena.  As I have Luclin and Velious now, Xunik and I (and anyone else who can come) will be spending more time there, gathering loot for prizes, gifts, ect.
  <P>

  <P>
  First general membership meeting will take place at TOXX
  druid ring at 4pm EST on Saturday Dec 29 / 2001.  Xunik will
  be porting groups into the rings for the meeting.  Please try
  to be online at least 30 minutes before the meeting, so that ports
  can be done and we can start right at 4pm EST.
  <P>
  For Branded officers, there will be a meeting either Thursday
  or Friday before the meeting to discuss guild business.  Leave
  msgs on the board for a convienient time and your preference of
  Thursday or Friday.

  for members who have registered with the msg board and the
  guild magic database system.
