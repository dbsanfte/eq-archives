<h1 align="center">What to look for in a guild</h1>

<p>
Choosing a guild or joining any group can be an important decision. It is something you gain from and something you commit your time and effort to. The guild you choose to join has to match what you are looking for. If you find the right guild, your time and effort will be well spent and you will be greatly rewarded.

<p>
There are some important qualities of guilds you need to look at to find ones that match what you are looking for. These allow you to understand what the guild is like and help the guild avoid problems.

<dl>
<dt><b><font size=4>Reasons for being together (Charter)</font></b>
<dd>This gives the reasons why the guild was formed and why the members want to be together. Be sure the reasons are good and they are the same reasons why you want to be in the guild.

<p>
<dt><b><font size=4>Rules of Conduct</font></b>
<dd>What members do and are allowed to do is important to look at. This gives you an idea of the guild's morals and attitude. This prevents problems between members and people outside the guild. The rules of conduct should match how you act and what you believe if you want to avoid problems and be satisfied.

<p>
<dt><b><font size=4>Loot Rules</font></b>
<dd>These let you know how items and money are distributed. Everyone has a different idea of who should get what and why. This prevents fighting among people by having everyone agree to who gets what. These rules should cover all guild events and also address what nonmembers who participate get.

<p>
<dt><b><font size=4>Decision Making</font></b>
<dd>This involves who makes official guild decisions and how they are made. It also shows how members are represented and who takes care of problems. This tells you what part you will play in the guild.
