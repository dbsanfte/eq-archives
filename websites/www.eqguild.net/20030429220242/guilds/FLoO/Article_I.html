<b>Article I. ~ General Rules of Conduct for Legion Members</b>
<p>
<p>
<b>Sec a) 1.</b>  to be invited into the Foreign Legion of Odus, one must have achieved their tenth level. This is to insure that the character in question is one that will likely still exist for a long time to come.  To be invited into the Legion, you will also need a sponsor. This can be any member of our guild whom has served with us no less then 30 days.
<p>
<b>Sec a) 2. </b>Once invited we are happy to have you in our guild. All new members are on a trial period of one weeks time, so that we may have a better chance to get to know you. Anytime within that week your membership is "at will". Meaning, you may leave the guild, or be removed with or without reason and there would be no hard feelings. We understand our guild is not for everyone, and that not everyone is for our guild.


<p>
<b>Sec b) </b> it is mandatory that any member of the Legion conduct themselves with honor. In any situation you are to conduct yourself with integrity. If you find yourself in a situation that compromises you ability to remain composed, please leave the scene, or ask for advice from a fellow guild mate.
<p>
<b>Sec c) </b> remember when you are in the world of Norrath, you represent not only yourself, but your guild. Take pride in your guild, and be assured it will take pride in you. You have a piece of ownership in this Legion, so ask yourself what you can do to help it prosper. Know that any person could be a potential ally.
<p>
<b>Sec d)</b> it is not mandatory, but considered a matter of respect to salute your higher ranking officers. They will also show you the same courtesy.
<p>
<b>Sec e)</b> there is a specific chain of command within the Legion. The ranks in order from lowest to highest are: Legionnaire, Conscript, Centurion, Militant Council, and Imperator General. If you have any difficulties, feel free to contact any of the above superior ranked officers. The ear of any of them will be open to you for advice, assistance when possible, or matters of state.
<p>
<b>Sec f) </b>all members of this Legion have a voice and matter. If you have something to offer, a suggestion for change or whatever, then feel free to send a "tell" to your next highest available ranking officer. i.e.… if a Conscript is unavailable, then you can go directly to a Centurion, so on and so forth.
