        <h2>The Start</h2>
        <p>First go to Telin Darkforest (Level 55) in Burning Woods. He roams 
          near to the Skyfire zone and has been sited at positive 3234 positive 
          2871. Ask him "what action" and he will give you a note. If 
          he doesn't, then your faction is too low. Faction can be built up fast 
          by doing the muffin-quest in Freeport.</p>
        <p>Next, find Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark. She can be found in 
          the northern part of the zone near the Chrushbone entrance. Just roam 
          around close to the entrance and use tracking. She is a rare spawn so 
          it may take a while to find her. Once you do find her, give her the 
          note and you receive a ring. After giving her the note she depops. Giz 
          X'Tin (Level 40) is found in Kithicor near the path from West Commons 
          to Highpass Hold. Give him the ring and he gives you a dark metal coin. 
          Giz roams along the path. After you hand him the ring a level 50 Darkelf 
          Reaver spawns and attacks you. Be prepared and have Spirit of the Wolf 
          cast on you so that you can run away. Go back to Telin Darkforest and 
          give him the Coin. He will give it back to you as worn metal coin. He 
          tells you to find Athele. Find Athele in East Karanas. She can be found 
          just north of the barbarian fishing village. Give her the worn metal 
          coin and receive a worn amulet. Give this amulet to Sionae (spawns -2300, 
          -930), then to Nuien (spawns -3650, -300) and finally to Teloa (spawns 
          -3800, -2860). When you give the amulet to Teloa the Dark Elf Corruptor 
          and two Darkelf Reavers (All around level 50) spawn. You should have 
          one of your druid friends stand on the hill east of the river (loc -1500, 
          -1000). He will depop after 10 seconds if not attacked so have the druid 
          kite the Corruptor over to you. You needn't worry about the Reavers, 
          they will head towards the four druids. Just kill the Corruptor and 
          get the tome. The Reavers will probably just kill the druids which is 
          fine because Athele will spawn in about one hour. Give Athele the tome 
          and he gives you an earthstained Note. Bring this to Ella Foodcrafter. 
          Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket is this wanted women that wanders 
          the zone. Give her the earthstained note and she will tell you that 
          she needs a mixture. She will give you her mixing bowl. It is a Container 
          so you need a free slot in the Inventory. She also mentions some kind 
          of ancient bowl that she needs. </p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>The Hardened Mixture</h4>
        <p><br>
          You must forage 4 items that you have to combine in Ella's mixing bowl. 
          Chilled Tundra Root from Everfrost Peaks. Sweetened Mudroots from Misty 
          Thicket. Speckled Moldy Mushrooms from Innothule Swamp. Heartfruit from 
          Greater Faydark. Go to these places and put the "Forage" button 
          into your hotkey, find a nice safe space and hit forage continuously. 
          This can take several hours so be prepared. When you get the items, 
          combine them in the bowl and you get a Hardened Mixture.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>The Runed Bowl</h4>
        <p>Go to the Chess Island in Timorous Deep. The level 57 spell Succor 
          will take you there, but it has been reported to drain your mana to 
          about two bubbles to use cautiously. Once you get there, ask Alrik Farsight 
          (location unknown) "How do you make an ancient bowl?". He 
          gives you a crushed pot and sends you to Felwithe. Talk to Farios Elianos 
          (location unknown) in Felwithe South. If he doesn't respond to you then 
          your faction with Keepers of the Art is too low. You can build up faction 
          fast with the batwing-quest in Felwithe South. If Farios talks to you, 
          give him the pot and you receive a grocery list. He will give you the 
          receipt for the bowl if you do a job for him. Bring this grocery list 
          to Merchant Nora (Location Unknown) in Felwithe north and she gives 
          you in return a bag of Provisions. Bring it to Farios and he gives you 
          the receipt for the ancient bowl. Head back to Alrik Farsight in Timorous 
          Deep . He will give you an ancient pattern when you give him the receipt. 
          The pattern says that you have to combine it with a piece of enchanted 
          clay and platinum speckled powder in a pottery wheel. NO skill in pottery 
          required. Platinum speckled powder can be obtained through another sub 
          quest. Forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and give it to Merdan 
          Fleetwood (Location also Unknown) in Surefall Glades. The old wooden 
          painting that you receive has to be brought to the human skeleton (Level 
          40) that roams the western part of Frontier Mountains. It was said to 
          have been sighted running from Burning Woods to the Dreadlands. He conned 
          indifferently to this certain person. Head back with the silver chained 
          locket you got from the skeleton to Surefall Glades and give it to Niera 
          Farbreeze (Level 50). She hands you the platinum speckled powder. Enchanted 
          clay can be obtained through Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim's EverHot Forge. 
          If you ask him "what mud" and "do it for me" he 
          will tell you that he would like to have a colored axe for his service. 
          He wants a Jade Reaver that can be found in the City of Mist off of 
          a Black Reaver who is about level 52. Hand Kinlo the axe and you get 
          the enchanted clay. I think that if you are KoS to the dwarves then 
          you can do this part invisible. Just go to the Everhot Forge and hand 
          Kinlo a Jade Reaver to get the clay. Now combine the pattern, clay and 
          powder in any pottery wheel to make the Rune Crested Bowl.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>The Stones</h4>
        <p>Go Back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter the hardened mixture 
          and the rune crested bowl. She will make for you a softly glowing stone 
          from it. Ella tells you to find one such as yourself. For the Druids 
          this means to seek out Foloal Stormforest (Location Unknown) in Firiona 
          Vie. Ask her "are you one such as myself?", "what answers?" 
          and "what about Venril Sathir?". She tells you to bring her 
          the stone you already have from Ella and the gem that can be found on 
          Venril Sathir. Kill Venril Sathir (-90, -777) in Karnor's Castle and 
          loot the gem he drops. Venril is a very tough level 55. He is only killed 
          my strong guilds because he is level 55, hits for 300 FAST, has a 1000+ 
          life suck spell and has two personal clerics how heal him whenever they 
          get hurt. This guy is extremely hard so you might want to be in a good 
          group to do this part. Give the gem and the softly glowing stone to 
          Foloal Stromforest and get a warm pulsating stone. Now this is the time 
          where the quest splits up into the Druid and the Ranger parts. Foloal 
          tells you to take the stone and walk your path. Apparently, this leads 
          you back to Telin Darkforest in the Burning Woods. Give him the warm 
          pulsating stone. In return he will give you An Ancient Sword. </p>
        <h4>The Hammers</h4>
        <p>Now head to The Hole which is a zone adjacent to Paineel. Find Jaeil 
          the Wretched (level 50) and have enchanters mesmerize him. Also have 
          a raid party in the room ready for battle. Go behind Jaeil and give 
          him the Shiny Tin Bowl. He will scream at himself and then Jaeil the 
          Insane will spawn. Now the raid party goes into action and kills Jaeil 
          the Insane. Loots from Jaeil the Insane a Soulbound Hammer. Go to Erudin 
          and find Mairee. She is in the jewelry shop, by the bank. Give her the 
          Soulbound Hammer and in return she will give you the Dwarven Smiths 
          Hammer. Now go to the Plane of Air and kill the Essence Tamer. He spawns 
          on the fourth island and drops the Swirling Sphere of Color. Take the 
          Dwarven Smiths Hammer and the Swirling Sphere of Color and give them 
          to Mairee. In return, she will give you the Hammer of the Ancients. 
          Go back to Kinlo Strongarm and give him the Hammer of the Ancients. 
        </p>
        <h4>The Swords</h4>
        <p>This will cause (in a puff of smoke) Usbak the Old to spawn and he 
          will give you Small Bit of Mithril Ore. Give Usbak the Old your Ancient 
          Longsword and he will return to you the new and improved Refined Ancient 
          Longsword. Hand the Mithril Ore to Kinlo to get the Refined Mithril 
          Blade. Go back to the Burning Woods, to Telin and give him the Refined 
          Ancient Sword. This causes Faelin Bloodbriar to spawn and Telin will 
          give you back the Refined Ancient Sword. So, give the Refined Ancient 
          Sword to Faelin and she will enchant it for you and return to you Swiftwind, 
          the first epic weapon. At this point she despawns after saying some 
          stuff about how you have to kill Innoruuk to rebalance the world. That 
          is exactly what you are going to do. Go to the Plane of Hate and kill 
          Innoruuk. His location is (-65, -196) and he spawns about once a week. 
          He is a level 55 Wizard with approx. 32246 hitpoints. He is a green 
          looking man wearing clothes. Loot the Shattered Emerald of Corruption. 
        </p>
        <h3>The End</h3>
        <p>Take the Refined Mithril Blade and the Shattered Emerald of Corruption 
          to Xanthuus the treant in North Karanas. In return he will give you 
          the last epic weapon, the Earth Caller.</p>

        <p> </p>
        <p>These faction issues were found on the Ranger FA Quest maintained by 
          Crydee Ossiriand.</p>
        <p>Plane of Growth<br>
          Although the Plane of Growth is not used for the quest, it does need 
          special mentioning.</p>
        <p>Telin Darkforest [Faydark's Champion]<br>
          Telin Darkforest is on Faydark's Champion faction. Any of the Kelethin 
          Ranger quests will give you faction with him. You can also kill orcs 
          in Crushbone.</p>
        <p>Giz X`Tin [unknown]<br>
          He is mostly be on one of the Dark Elf Factions and will probably be 
          less than indifferent to you. If this is the case, cast Spirit of Wolf 
          on yourself [to be able to keep up with him] than sneak up behind him 
          so that he will be indifferent to you and then give him the ring. If 
          you give him the ring, while he /CONs dubious [or lower] to you, you 
          will not get the coin to continue the quest.</p>
        <p>Dark Elf Corruptor and Dark Reavers in East Karana [Dark Elf Warrior]<br>
          Killing them will not impact faction with the Neriak Guards. This faction 
          will only be noteworthy to any Dark Elves [and to a lesser extent Trolls 
          and Ogres] that may wish to assist you with killing these.</p>
        <p>Alrik Farsight [Keepers of the Art]<br>
          To gain faction with Alrik Farsight, visit the Magician Guild in Felwithe 
          [B] and give Niola Impholder Bat Wings until she is amiable to you. 
          If your faction with Niola Impholder is so low that she doesn't give 
          you faction when you turn them in, stand behind her and use sneak to 
          make her indifferent to you.</p>
        <p>Kinlo Strongarm & Usbak the Old [unknown]<br>
          If your faction with these dwarves is less than indifferent, you will 
          need to stand behind them and use sneak in order to be able to deal 
          with them.<br>
