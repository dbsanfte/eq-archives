As the storm raged about them, the grizzled warrior barked the orders to secure the camp from the tortuous weather, his words almost lost in the pained moans of the trees.  His men toiled and strained against the wind and driving rain.  Lightning stabbed out of the foul night sky to momentarily steal their sight, causing them to more than once trip over each other, sprawling into the muddy earth beneath them.
<P>
The warrior, ever wary of the dangers of the wild, decided to have one last look around, when his eyes caught with that of his steed.  An animal bred and trained for up close battle was wild with fear and not of the storm for they had weathered worse before.  This unsettled the warrior greatly.
<P>
Before he had time to think a faint whistling grew to an enormous thundering, as a gout of flame roared by him and into the tent.  He watched as if in slow motion as the flames ripped through the material and swiftly consumed everything they touched.  The warrior watched helplessly as his friends and brothers died, flesh burning away from their bones.  His quick reflexes brought his mighty shield to bear as the dragon sweapt it's breath from the pyre to the warrior.  He could feel the heat of its breath singeing his hair even as the magical shield parted the flames and protected him from the hellish blast.
<P>
Man and beast paused to lock eyes, daring the other to move first.  Like a cat pouncing on a bird, the dragon struck swiftly, lashing out with its claws, jaws snapping closed on empty air as the warrior dove under the great beast.  The dragon, forgeting for a moment the rain drenched ground, slid past where the warrior was, it's momentum broken only by a couple of trees unfortunate enough to be in its path.  The warrior, sprang to his feet, reorienting on the foul drake's back.  Leaping and running for all he was worth, he managed to scale the great beasts back.  Hacking and tearing into the beasts hide, he felt his hand and arm begin to tingle with raw power, as if something ancient and powerful had been awakened in the blade, greatful to be plunging into the flesh of the Great Wyrm.
<P>
His advantage was soon to wear thin, as the dragon shook off the impact with the trees and blows raining down on it's back.  Quickly it extended its wings out full and flapped once, jumping as it did, rolling in the air as it jumped, flipping the warrior into the air and turning to follow his short flight to the ground.  The dragon deftly clawed at him halting his movement towards the ground and tossing him into the air like a rag doll.  The warrior felt bones snapping and flesh tearing as he sailed into the air, eyes barely seeing through the rage and the pain.  The sword let loose a flash of energy infinitely brighter than the lightning, blinding both with searing white pain.  As the flash subsided, a burning like none the warrior had ever felt pulsed through his body, consuming, purifying and remaking flesh and bone as it went.
<P>
Finding himself whole and on the ground, the warrior quickly took stock of the rended battlefield.  The dragon lay about 50 feet away in a heap, steam pouring from it's scales.  No sign of breathing or movement.  That was good.  He looked to the area where the tent had been, the earth would be scarred for many years from the unatural heat.  There was nothing left.  No sign that there had been 10 good men, loyal and hardworking to the end, relaxing after a hard days travel.  The cowardly beast didn't have honour enough to allow them a warriors death.
<P>
He raised the blade up to inspect, the same weapon that was passed from father to son, one generation to the next.  Never before had his father spoken of any powers in the weapon.  Nor did the blade ever glow, blue-green as it was now.  As he watched, the glow grew brighter and began pulsing like it had a heartbeat of it's own.
<P>
Looking to where the corpse was, he blinked in astonishment as the dragon was nowhere to be seen.  The warrior wheeled in a circle to locate the wretched beast.
<P>
A powerful voice thrust through his confusion.  A simple command that caused him to crouch and spring to the side.  The great Wyrm thundered into the ground where he'd been a moment before, causing great chunks of grass and mud to spray out everywhere from the impact.
<P>
Seeing his opportunity, the warrior leaped on the great beast.  Steel and fangs blurred in a furious exchange as lightning lanced through the rain and night sky.  The warrior exhausted by the raging battle, knew that if the killing blow did not come soon he would be finished.  In desparation, he launched himself into the air, trying to gain purchase on the dragons head.  The dragon sensing what his opponent was attempting, snapped his jaws shut on the warriors sword arm, almost tearing it from the fighters body.
<P>
The agony of the wound caused the warrior to lose grip on the ancient weapon.  The sword caught in the creatures throat causing the great beast tremendous pain.  The beast bunched its neck muscles in preparation for the hellish blast of its breath.  The warrior knew his end had come.  Flames blasted out of the creatures nose and mouth, in an attempt to dislodge the weapon and slay the warrior.  In silence the warrior stood his ground, not even bothering to raise his shield.  The flames washed over the warrior setting his skin ablaze.  Sudenly the sword shattered under the great heat, its own ancient powers being released in a magical blast that consumed both man and Wyrm.
<P>
A hundred years had passed since that great battle.  A dwarven smith had taken refuge in the clearing of that battle, hoping to shelter himself and his family from a raging storm that caught them unawares.  As he struggled against the wind and the driving rain to erect his tent, he tripped over something solid.  Cursing the gods for his misfortune, the dwarf dug through the mud to see what had tripped him up.
<P>
The moment he touched the blade, he knew what had happened here.  The thoughts and images of man an beast racing through his head.  Holding the sword in his hand, he vowed that the warriors story would not go untold, his kin, even if they be grand children and great grand children must know of his valor in the face of a daunting enemy.  He also vowed that if ever a beast, creature or man ever perpetrated a cowardly act of this nature, they would surely die.
<P>
Upon competion of his words, the sword began to glow, faint blue-green.  The lightning increased in intensity and crashed down around the clearing.  A great bolt from the heavens struck the sword as the Dwarf raised it into the air.  In but a moment the dwarf lay unconcious in the mud.
<P>
When he awoke, he was surrounded by his friends and family.  His body ached and it pained him to breath, but he knew he was whole and safe.  "Bring me my weapon", he bellowed.  A young dwarf came forward bearing a tattered scabbard.  The smith drew the blade forth and saw the symbol that was etched in fine diamond dust on the blade.  Instantly his arm throbbed.  Pulling the sleeve of his tunic up, he saw that he had the same mark on his arm as the sword.
<P>
It was then the sword spoke to him.  "Take me up and fulfill the oath that you took in the clearing.  For you are now Branded.  Make all creatures and peoples know of your wrath for the treachery that you have witnessed through me."
<P>
And so ... the warrior told all that he knew of the battle that was fought a hundred years ago.  As the smith finished, one by one, his family, friends and sword brothers stood and came forward, asking that they too be Branded ...
