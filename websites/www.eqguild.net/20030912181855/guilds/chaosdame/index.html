                called Chaos, do you? Then sit, sit, have an ale while I tell
                you of this mixed up bunch of folks.”<br>

                No, no. ~sipping ale~ A description of a few of them might
                better set example of this clan of chaotic folks. Yes, that will
                for start. Listen well, traveler.”<br>

                with beauty so great she captivates the men around her. Not your
                regular beauty this woman, Cin, as I like to call her, she is a
                collector… of men! Guard ye well your men if you be a woman,
                for I have yet to see any but the steadfast Maragore resist her
                temptations. Often found by her side is the valiant Tuffer, her
                rogue companion.” ~sigh, leaning closer, whispering~ “He
                battles within himself, for he has found an artifact that
                transforms his barbarian being into one of the dark Elvin kind.
                A man of good, Tuffer, but the mask he carries is evil. Thanks
                to the gods that Cin is not a follower of evil or poor Tuffer
                would surely never remove that mask of deception!”<br>

                comedy act all his own, I say. And the lord Kinerin. Charming
                soul that one, always ready to rescue the maiden in need. Shall
                be his down fall one day, quote me on that. But then of course

                words would make for an entertaining eve mixed with Revoleht’s
                mad hatter thinking. Toss in Redblood and your sides might split
                in half, literally! But if bone humor isn’t your style, then
                avoid the necro Red.” ~winks~</b></font></p>
