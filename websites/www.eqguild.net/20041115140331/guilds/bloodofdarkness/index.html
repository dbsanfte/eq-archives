            <b>01/02/2003 - We need YOU!</b> - Posted by: <i>Rokke</i><br>
    			That's right YOU!  Well, if you are 50+.  We need to fight the Spirit of Torment for the Jakr's Beastlord Epic.  Any and all who can attend, would be appreciated.  Please feel free to invite your friends to come along too.  Nothing brings a guild together better than a good ol' fashioned ghetto beatdown! The time will be Sunday around 5:30pm EST.  Jakr and myself will probably be contacting you individually in game ass well.
 			<br><br>
 			We also need screen shots of accomplishments by guild members.  Any information that you'd like me to add just send to <a href="mailto:rokkelanys@hotmail.com">rokkelanys@hotmail.com</a>
 			<br><br>
 			I'd like to thank all of you that helped me with my Epic fight in Steamfont.  Poor Renux never stood a chance.  Many thanks!

    		The site hasn't been updated in a while so there is much to announce.  so Here is the list of updates.<br><br>
  		<ul>
  			<li>Ty has reached 59!  Way to go man!
  			<li>Jasir's Epic has been achieved!  Gratz to Jas on his this hefty milestone!  WTG!
  			<li>I(Rokke) decided to let Kraiziee talk him into a rather "kraiziee" task.  Early christmas morning, I had Abumien of AP port me into Plane of Hate and then gate out.  After which I used hide and sneak to make my way to the Book of Souls.  Epic Mission: Book of Souls achieved.  Check! =p  Thanks to Abumien and Kraiziee/Cinan for their help in this rather frightening mission.
  		</ul>
  		Don't forget the CoM raid Friday Night at 7PM!<br><br>

            <b>09/04/2002 - Every Playful Raster Goes Down... AGAIN!!</b> - Posted by: <i>Rokke</i><br>
    		Raster was quite the playful one this weekend making not one appearance(see note below for Kraiziee) but TWO!  He was, of course, promply owned by Quilon!  I guess he wasn't a myth after all!  See pic <a href="images/raster2.jpg">here</a>!! Congrats Quilon!

            <b>08/26/2002 - DOWN GOES FRAZIER! ... er.. RASTER!!</b> - Posted by: <i>Rokke</i><br>
    		Kraiziee defeats raster in a record camp time of just over ONE HOUR!!  See pic
   		<a href="images/Raster.jpg">here</a>!!  Congrats Kraiziee!

            <b>08/26/2002 - General Updates</b> - Posted by: <i>Rokke</i><br>
    		Is he a myth?  I think Quilon is beginning to think so.  Raster
   		has yet to show his ugly mug for our (now slightly insane)monk monk friend.
   		Keep it up Quilon.  He has to pop sometime!
   	</p>
   	<p>
   		Kariana has been just a dinging fool.  Moving her Rogue up as much as 6 levels in
   		one day! Keep dinging along Kari...
