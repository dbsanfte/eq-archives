                of Truth Guild Roster</a></p>
              <p align="left">We are using <a href="http://www.guildmagic.com" target="_blank">www.guildmagic.com</a> 
                to keep track of our members. <b>You are responsible for signing 
                up for the guild and keeping your character information current. 
                </b>Since several people have had problems signing on and creating 
                accounts, I have created the following step-by-step guide to the 
                process: </p>
              <p align="left">1. Go to <a href="http://www.guildmagic.com/create_user.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.guildmagic.com/create_user.cfm 
                </a></p>
              <p align="left">2. Create your private account by entering a username, 
                password and timezone. You can use this account anytime to update 
                your character skills, level, etc. </p>
              <p align="left">3. You will be taken to a login screen where you 
                need to log in with the usename and password you just created.</p>
              <p align="left">4. Go to add guilds to my user and select our guild</p>
              <p align="left">5. Create a new character. You can also create alternative 
                characters that are in the guild. </p>
              <p align="left">6. Once Crohan approves the character application, 
                your character will be listed in the guild. Please don't panic 
                if you don't see your character on the roster immediately.</p>
              <p align="left">7. If you have any further questions about the guildmagic 
                system, please read their FAQ at: <a href="http://www.guildmagic.com/faq.cfm" target="_blank">http://www.guildmagic.com/faq.cfm</a><br>
              </p>
              <p align="left">8. Please keep your character information updated 
                regularly. </p>
              <p align="left">9. If you are having problems logging in or creating 
                characters, read the statement below. If you have other questions 
                that are not answered in the Guild magic FAQ above, please email 
                iluvia at <a href="mailto:iluvia_got@hotmail.com">iluvia_got@hotmail.com</a> 
                for help. </p>
              <p align="left"><b>Please be aware that guildmagic is experiencing 
                some ISP problems right now. </b>You may have difficulties in 
                creating or updating your character or creating an account until 
                the problems are fixed. If you can not create or update your character, 
                please try using Netscape to do it. I don't know why, but it works 
                better for some people. Please give it a try and don't give up. 
                If the network is busy please try to log on at an off-peak time 
                and try again. Thank you for your patience. </p>
