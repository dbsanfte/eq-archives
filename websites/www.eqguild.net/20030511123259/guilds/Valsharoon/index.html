Welcome to the Bones Brigade. May I have the pleasure of welcoming you to Norrath, and for some of you, Luclin. Friends, I ask you to be ready to face the challenges and rigors that will be set upon you. We intend to prove our worth in combat to the gods of Norrath and Luclin and we need to rally more and more members to become a mighty force. Tunare is not safe, the evil god Innorruk will die also, and the Plaguebearer... all of them. We have to show them we mean business.  We need to gain knowledge and experience to grow, and in this we have a common goal. We sound evil enough, but we aren't allied to goodness or evil but will help both causes for the right price. We have a code to be followed if you wish to join us, "Honor Above All". We want to help others and make them want to assist us in our goal so we try to be good to others. Helping someone who needs help with that last kill, selling that wanted item for a little less than normal, buffing that one guy for his long CR. Just use good judgement and aim high and you will do fine with us. Be fair and polite but just and thorough in all you do. This guild is open to Character Levels 15 and up. We are a loot/exp raid based guild. Know that we are your friends as everyone in this guild <i>should</i> be. We disreguard race class and religeon. That doesn't concern us, but if you share our views join us! Now go and slay and get ready for the time of your life!<br>
