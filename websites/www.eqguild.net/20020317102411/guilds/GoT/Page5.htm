As I have played this game I have learned that some people are very nice and others very nasty, many of whom belong to different guilds.  This Officer should maintain a list of allies and enemies of the Guardians of Twighlight, and it would be at his decision that council vote for a guild war should the need come about.  This person must be willing to research the strength and size of other guilds and try to gain a working relationship with the other guilds Executive Officers.</font>

This Officer will need to be very creative, and be able to take input from all guild members.  The sole responsibility is to arrange all types of events from raids, to monster hunts, to just about anything.  This Officer would come up with the events and schedule them working closely with the other officers </font>

This officer needs to be able to not only keep the web site up, but also implement things like a message board where guild members can post messages to each other.  This officer will need to work closely with other officers to post news, upcoming events, membership information, and much more.  Showing off with our guild web site might be just the break your looking for or maybe your already a pro at it.</font>

     </B></U><font size=2 color=#40c040 face="Times New Roman BTª<">: Ah yes! Recruiting other members.  This is hard task because we want the highest quality but many are in guilds already.  This officer will have much work in store but will be aided by other officers.  Most important is that this officer decides who to recruit, when to recruit, how to recruit.  Should we have EQ people apply for membership or take anyone and everyone?  Do we get rid of the ones who breaks the rules or never partipate or associate with the guild? This is the job of the Recruitment Officer.</font>

     </B></U><font size=2 color=#40c040 face="Times New Roman BTª<">: This Officer will be very important to the guild and the other Officers.  The Officer should do his/her best to keep track of all membership information.  For instance how many members, how many officers, how many bards and druids etc., and who is active in the membership and who is not!  They would work closely with the Recruitment Officer to get the best mix of members, with the Information Officer so that we may contact each other, and the Events Officer so we know who participates in guild acitivities and who does not.</font>
