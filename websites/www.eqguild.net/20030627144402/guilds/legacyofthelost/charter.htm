                 all of the corners of Norrath we've come. We were<BR>
                 once lost, once without a home. Without a leader, <BR>
                 without a place. Guilds, friends, and family we had, but<BR>
                 our hearts yearned for more. A connection missing...<BR>
                 It seemed that the world lacked respect, lacked love.<BR>
                 All the things we needed. Maybe they seemed to be <BR>
                 there, but in the end, it was all an illusion. After <BR>
                 the many pains endured, and the many travels spend<BR>
                 wandering lost and alone, frustrated and confused...<BR>
                 Our paths met, and a spark of hope filled our hearts.<BR>
                 There was one... Who with a smile, could assure you <BR>
                 everything was more than it seemed, and we were <BR>
                 worth something. Our leader she became, and our path <BR>
                 will forever endure. Together we will build a Legacy,<BR>
                 and together we shall endure anything that comes.<BR>

                 <I>We pledge</I> to help those in need, to share our knowledge 
                 <BR>
                 and wisdom without a grudge or a second thought, <BR>
                 to all those who ask.<BR>
                 <I>We pledge</I> to never stop learning, and to keep our minds<BR>
                 open of all things.<BR>
                 <I>We pledge</I> to respect every living breathing creature, <BR>
                 even when we disagree.<BR>
                 <I>We pledge</I> to meet your hello with reply, and to meet<BR>
                 a smile with another in return.<BR>
                 <I>We pledge</I> to put our friends and family above all things,<BR>
                 and that the only true wealth is love.<BR>
                 <I>We pledge</I> to participate in events and raids with our <BR>
                 friends and partners, whenever it's possible.<BR>
                 <I>We pledge</I> to always keep morale and a sense of right<BR>
                 on the tops of our minds, and not to purposely<BR>
                 offend another creature.<BR>
                 <I>We pledge </I>to keep our mouths open, and to speak<BR>
                 whenever the chance is given. To share ideas and<BR>
                 praise, and to make conversation when our time is free.</FONT></P>
