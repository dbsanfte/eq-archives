The Meaning<BR>
<BR>
She awoke with a start, her bedroll soaked with sweat.  She was clutching the ground as she does when out of mana.  Yes.  The dream had come again,only this time it was bad enough to wake her. She recounted the nightmare
as she had done so many nights before....<BR>
<BR>
"The cold, snow covered ground is getting more cold by the second.  Pulling had gone sour and group members are dying.  We lost the cleric and our best tank. The paladin is almost dead,  the shaman trying to heal him. The wizard and I are both very low on mana. Using his last mana in a big nuke, the wizard pulls all the mobs on him. He dies quick, too quick. The paladin has  the mobs again, shaman meleeing now as well. I stand for my last bit of healing then begin to whack the mobs with my mace. Down goes the pally. Shaman at half life screams "Runaway!". I run, not getting far when my last team-mate goes down. Running now,  like I have never run before.<BR>  
Using all the tricks of evasion, I too...fall to my death !"
<BR>
<BR>
It was time for change.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The following night, her dream came back.  This time though, the face of Tunare appeared above the field of battle stopping all in their tracks.  A circle of light forms around the group binding them mentally in to a single fighting force. The battle ensues and the group is victorious!! It works, they had discovered teamwork. Stolidly the group held hands, and so formed the Sacred Circle.<BR>
<BR>
Sacred Circle of Life - EverQuest(TM) guild residing on Vazaelle
<BR><BR>
In this world full of danger, friendship usually means the difference between life and death. We roam the lands, searching endlessly for people to trust with our lives. To help us in our struggles. It is now time to end our pains... to unite together with trust, knowledge and understanding. <BR><BR>
It is time to join the Sacred Circle.<BR>
<BR>
First and formost we come together within this Guild to have fun. Working together as a close group of friends.  We encourage each member to get to know their guildmates.  In order to count upon each other, it is important that each of us walk in kind.  Experience this game (yes i said game) with joy and laughter. Sharing of wealth or items within the guild family is acceptable. Members are not bound to group with their guildmates. Everyone should take a role in the molding of the guild so as to get a true reflection of who we are. The planning of raids, quest parties, celebrations and any other guild events is highly encouraged and recommended for all members. Guild raids and Quest parties are open to all members.<BR>
<BR>
Goals<BR>
<BR>
Our goals at this time are to have fun,  advance ourselves and to create a family-style atmosphere.  In time, as the guild grows, the members may want to expand upon these goals.  If a member has anything that they would like to add or change they are encouraged to submit suggestions to any of the Sentinels.  Sacred Circle votes as a whole on any changes that are not vetoed by the Guardians.  Communication is a goal easy to achieve,  yet so often overlooked.<BR>

"The Sacred Circle has neither beginning nor end. It encircles us in it's form.
 It teaches us about the cycle of life with motion and movement. A symbol of 
the divine strength rooted deeply inside all people." <BR>     - Zahasha<BR>

Sacred Circle of Life Code of Conduct<BR>
<BR>
Walk with honor, maturity, dignity, honesty, respect, trust and loyalty for your guild. We must agree that within the Sacred Circle there is no place for prejudice, bigotry or hatred.<BR>
<BR>
HONOR - We want to keep our guild name in good standing!  Never steal another players kill or loot.  Sometimes this happens as a mistake.  In this case apologize and return the loot.<BR>
<BR>
MATURITY/DIGNITY - It is very important that everyone bear some form of maturity in dealings with other players. This is especially true with players outside the guild. Try not to argue but debate instead. When dealing with a bad player think of tact before you act. Feel free to inform the rest of the guild about these players so that we may avoid them ourselves. Silence is often the best weapon.<BR>
<BR>
HONESTY/RESPECT/TRUST/LOYALTY - Be honest and respectful to all 
players.  Do not waste peoples time by making them wait unnecessarliy long for you. In respect of our privacies no member shall give out another members' personal information to anyone, ever, for any reason. Members may keep their real world identity anonymous. When signing up for guild events, raids, etc., arrive ready and on time.  Be loyal to your guildmates and they will be loyal to you.<BR>
<BR>
Currently  the Guild has approved to follow Dwarf/Dragon faction in the Velious conflict.  Individual members may choose to persue Giant faction , but should be aware that this choice may make it impossible for them to travel and group with other guildees in Velious.
<BR>
<BR>

++++ Failure to follow these guidelines makes you subject to dismissal from the guild ++++<BR>
<BR>
-------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Meetings<BR>
Please try to attend guild meetings.  We seek a democracy in this guild, wishing to discuss issues rather than have a leader make the decisions for us. If a member can not attend a meeting it is their responsability to learn what transpired at the meeting. They may have their absentee vote(proxy) cast by a guardian.<BR>
<BR>
Guildgroups<BR>
Guild groups shall award loot on a "need before greed" basis. Alphabetical order on looting and random dice rolls on rare [where the previous winner(s) abstain until all have won a rare item] are both suggested means of ensuring equal loot distribution. Looting rules are ultimately decided on a group-to-group basis.<BR>
<BR>
"First and foremost we come together in the Sacred Circle Guild to have fun as a family of friends; mindful that sharing, caring, giving and laughing are good for the soul." - Zahasha<BR>
<BR>
The Guild's Guardians<BR>
<BR>
 - Guildmaster, Oracle and Sentinels. They are the keepers of knowledge and speakers for the guild. Responsible for the organization of meetings. These positions are perminent unless resigned.<BR>
<BR>
Guildmaster: This individual will lead the Sacred Circle with everyones well being in mind. This person shall lovingly be known as the "Head Whipping Post". Delegation from this post goes to the Oracle.<BR><BR>
Oracle: The second in command. The leader when the Guildmaster is offline. This position is filled by a Sentinel the Guardians deem worthy. The Guildmaster has final say on who holds this position. Delegation from this post goes to Sentinels.<BR>
<BR><BR>
Sentinels: The officers of the guild. Chosen based upon merit. One Sentinel will exist for every ten members. New Sentinels will be added as membership grows. They serve as the voice for members with something to add to meetings when unable to attend. These positions may be resigned or revoked. This post delegates to willing members.<BR>
<BR><BR>
If a member is conducting themselves in a manner unbefitting the guild's code of conduct, they are to be reported to the Guardians immediateley.<BR>
<BR>
Joining The Sacred Circle of Life<BR>
<BR>
This guild is for the individual wanting good friends to share their experiences.<BR>
When inviting members we need to think in terms of quality, not quantity as this is not intended to be a huge guild. Membership may be closed at times especially during any reorganization.<BR>
1. Membership is open to any level, class, race or alignment (Diety)<BR>
2. Prospective Members must be sponsored by a member in good standing with the guild. They will be referred to as Initiates<BR>
3. Nomination of the initiate is to come from 3 guild members who know the initiate and have seriously grouped with them observing their actions. It is the responsibility of these 3 Sacred Circle members to judge the initiate unbiasedly against the guild guidelines<BR>
4. A vote follows the nomination with a majority vote being required for approval. No fewer than 10 Sacred Circle of Life members must be present ( including a min of one guild Guardian) in guild chat and available for the vote<BR>
5. The Initiate will be notified by the membership Sentinel of the guilds decision<BR>
6. The Initiate must attend a guild meeting to be admitted as a member<BR>



<BR>
<BR><BR>
Leaving guild<BR>
<BR>
- A member may leave at anytime.<BR><BR>
- A member can be dismissed by either the Guardians or at a guild meeting by a majority vote of the membership.<BR><BR>
- Anyway that you leave the guild, you lose your title, position and control. Returning members will have these restored in a case by case basis.<BR>
