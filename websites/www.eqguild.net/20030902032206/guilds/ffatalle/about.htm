    <td width="100%"><font face="Arial">Femmes Fatalle was started by a group of friends who
    had a vision of something better in a guild than what they had previously found.</font><p><font
    face="Arial">Our original intent was to have a guild for all female characters.  
    Well, that quickly went awry as more and more men wanted to be a part of what we
    are.  Husbands, sons, and close male friends also share our vision of what a guild
    should be.  Femmes Fatalle is still goverened by women, and we have no plans to
    change that, though we do have a few junior officers who are men.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">We are rather picky about who we invite to be a part of our family.
      Too many times have we seen guilds invite everyone and anyone just to have a large
    guild.  This is not for us.  We do not allow kill stealers, beggars, and other
    undersirables who would take the fun out of our game. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">We are a fun and friendly guild and do our best to make all our
    members feel at home.  We are big believers in helping and mentoring our lower level
    players.  To those who have proven themselves a part of our family, we are happy to
    help with equipment aquisitions, camping mobs, epics, etc.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">If you think this sounds too restrictive, then we are probably not
    the guild for you.  If, however, you would like to be a part of our family please
    send a tell to one of our <a href="members.htm">members</a>.   Join us on a raid, an
    xp group or let us get to know you in some way!</font></td>
