  <LI><B>Monday 26th February, 2002 - Epic Day</b><BR>
Patch day - two of them. We planned to pay a visit to Venril Sathir when the patch to fix the last patch the last patch patched had to be patched. So we had to wait, patiently - thee hours in fact until Xev let us back in .. <BR>
Rushed to get everyone assembled quickly, Venril Sathir himself was not around, but his remains were lurking in the 'Safe Room'.  <BR>
We managed to kill him with relative ease - the only fatality being Breiz. Bad luck there, shortie. He managed to drop two pulsating green stones for the druid epic, which went to Lurkan and Megwyn respectively. Megwyn is now at the halfway point in her epic and has obtained her Elaborate Scimitar. <BR>
This wasn't quite enough excitement for one day so we sought out Phinny - think we've finally nailed the single pulling tactic and his corpse was lying before us in no time at all. Tabula obtained a backbone which goes towards his own epic and Exces got himself a coral. <BR>

  <LI><B>Sunday 25th February, 2002 - Lucan Dies</b><BR>
Headed over to Freeport to seek out Lucan D'Vere. Breiz pulled and a vicious battle ensued, sadly one of the neighbourhood Iksars got attacked in town and our small gathering were attacked, all but one escaped with their life.  <BR>
We managed to reassemble and pulled off what was almost a textbook kill, Cuddan is now in a position to complete his Soulfire quest. Congratulations to you, Cuddan.

  <LI><B>Friday 22nd February, 2002 - City Of Mist Reavers</b><BR>
Back to the normal Friday morning hunting ground in search of Jade Reavers for our rather large druid population. We had far more luck there on this occasion, obtaining Jade Reavers for Bellilama, Megwyn and Paaw. This marks the halfway point for Bellilama and Paaw are now able to wield their Elaborate Scimitars. Congratulations to you both.  <BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

  <LI><B>Saturday 16th - Sunday 17th February, 2002 - 20hour  Hateathon</b><BR>
OK - so we were gonna go to hate at like 7:00 am on Sunday The but here I was with 4 stones in my pocket and some folks who kicked ass so....we went a bit early. <BR>
About 7 hours early in fact.<BR>
The break in wasnt too bad - only about 6 or 7 deaths on the way to the break in.<BR>
Rezzed folks up and wave 1 was in action...and the killing began. Zeksie began to pull stuff...and she didn't stop till we were done. Word to the freaki munki with the major major staying power.<BR>
After clearing roamers for about an hour, the zone started to repop...<BR>
We managed to score several bits of purple...Grats to the Dugster on his new funky purple pants, Filyna on her new Catwoman hat, Boots to Yinadriel and Fily too....not a bad day...but the purple BP eludes us still...and the cleric mini wasn't popped....so no go on this little run.<BR>
At one point people stared to drop like flies....but we held on with 2 tanks and a buttload of nukers...and the extremely skilled help of our guest chanter for this 2 hour period of holdin' on...Trazer. A more skilled chanter I am pressed to find...you saved us through this stretch...and helped us stay in place for waves 2-3-4 and 5.<BR>
I think its safe to say that almost every planar-capable member of Omerta and Celestial Rising had a come chance to play in Inny's lair this day.<BR>
So more people came....and some people who had been LD for hours returned...and more people went off to sleep.<BR>
And we killed a lot more stuff...Gratz to Thorlund on his indicolite arms...sadly there were no iskar warriors there...and a lot of the stuff from the mummies was destroyed...the drop table seems a tad skewed here methinks.<BR>
Then - we decided to move to the chapel. Cleared a bunch of wanderers...and settled in....some of the zone was repopping from our earlier efforts now...and we were able to kill a few more statics.<BR>
Than came - the Hand. <BR>
Mods were passed around...ppl buffed like crazy...and everyone knew that the small hand was just an hors d'oeuvre, the unpleasant Hand" was our true enemy.<BR>
So we pulled the little guy. We beat him down about halfway and some super crazy pathing made the little sucker take off for points unknown.<BR>
And then...SURPISE - the Maestro himself chose that very moment in our battle to pop into existence.<BR>
He charged right on over....luckily everyone was clued in about his lifetap and left me alone in front to be lifetapped. There was no panic...people reacted to what they needed to do like players in a Tchaikovski ballet. Nukers let fly with power at the right time - and tanks used theur offensive disciplines while I ground away form the front. Thanks to all the healers who kept me up ... and special mention to Babbax for the chain runing at one particularly tight moment in the fight. Maestro droped a pretty nice bard blade...but no bards there to loot it so - it rotted. 8(<BR>
And then the little guy came back - and was very hard to pin down....some extremely crazy pathing kept the melee's from getting a fix on the little puke. Dissb finally had enough of the Keystone Kops routine and nuked the litte bugger to kingdom come.<BR>
The unpleasant had was as advertised...but after the Maestro fight was a pushover in comparison. Thanks to all those who let me loot the epic bit. Now...only ball of everliving golem...green and red scales...that Queen thing...and oh yeah that Big Bird guy. Look for announcement sometime in 2004 re: Breiz's epic... LOL<BR>
One more mini went down...the Big Rogue mob...gratz to Fendel on his new BP and leggings!<BR>
We tried to pull more clerics - but after 20 hours in hate...and several tells from other guilds...we left.<BR>
Before I forget - special honorable mention for being a snaring MACHINE to Lurkan...you hung in there like a real soldier man.<BR>
Congratz to all who came...and had fun...and got loot...I had a blast. <BR>
We'll be back...count on it...but not for a few weeks...dont want to be too greedy.

  <LI><B>Friday 15th February, 2002 - City of Mist Reavathon</b><BR>
After our success in Karnors we headed to the City of Mist, managed to complete two reaver cycles but no sign of the Jade Reaver whatsoever. <br>
Selkie managed to pick up a Criers Scroll, a Personal Diary Page, a Merchants Letter, a Written Announcement and some Clay. Cuddan picked up an Axe of Souls, the Spirit of Scale for Paaw and Stunteartfarst obtained the cleric spell Reckoning.

  <LI><B>Friday 15th February, 2002 - Karnors Castle</b><BR>
Headed back to Karnors in search of Venril Sathirs remains, with our good friends in Celestial Rising, we managed to slay him with relative ease and as a result Bellilama and Paaw are now a step closer to their own epics.
<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

  <LI><B>Wednesday 13th February, 2002 - Karnors Castle - Venril Sathir</b><BR>
Araxas had a few very interesting and scary tactics to use against this one... four level 54+ warriors as tanks, chain complete healing clerics to assist them.<BR>
Sounds fine so far? Almost. The warriors duelled one another till they were in a beserker frenzy upon which numerous buffs were slapped on, including Runes on each one. <BR>
Upon pulling Venril Sathir the warriors employed their Mighty Strike discipline, this meant that not only were they dealing out a huge amount of damage, but their Mighty Strike discipline was able to keep Venril Sathir stunned for as long as possible, meaning he was unable to lifetap successfully. <BR>
This was indeed a mad plan and the first time we tried it - we failed - bodies everywhere - not to be beaten we gave it a second try and this time it was a breeze. Once VS was fairly low on hits he was nuked into the ground. <BR>
Congratulations to Talaz of Celestial Rising on gaining the gnarled staff and to Emeritus on her new ranger leggings.

  <LI><B>Sunday 10th February, 2002 - Vox</b><BR>
This was to be our first Vox raid in an attempt to gain Tignous paladin book for his epic. So we headed to see if the Lady was in and welcoming guests with Celestial Rising. <BR>
Some of us died with grace and honour in order to pay the Lady a visit - but nevertheless the Lady appeared more than a little shy. <BR>
After some five hours of waiting very politely at the door we had gone from elation at being able to attempt Vox - to boredom that she was indeed keeping us waiting - into a state of complete and utter drunkenness and we all managed to sober up aain for our ports to safety. <BR>
Some ventured off for a while in search of goods which would make good resist gear for a later Vox attempt - good thinking you guys. <BR>
This perhaps wasn't quite the Vox raid we had in mind, but it provided us with a time to get together and chat and generally make fools of ourselves - which we did quite a spectacular job of.

   <LI><B>Saturday 9th February, 2002 - Kael</b><BR>
Yes, Kael again. More armour pieces for the alliance,whilst drops themselves were a little disappointing, we managed to get a few rather nifty uprades for the alliance guilds. Three defiants dropped - congratulations to Dashard, Exces and Fendel. We also managed to fight far enough to be able to obtain two Sceptres of Mastery for our alliance pulling experts Skarrad and Zeksie.
<BR>We've all progressed so far now that it is forseeable that we will be revisiting Kael just just a small team in future to gain the remaining pieces of armour we need - and to hunt down the elusive Breastplates we've heard talk of.
<BR><hr noshade color="#000000">

   <LI><B>Monday 4th - Friday 8th January 2002 - The Hole</b><BR>
The guild as a whole have been spending a great deal of time in the Hole this week - not on ly in our attempt to gain strength through levelling but also to refine our teamworking skills with one another. <BR>
We're hoping to venture quite deep into The Hole very soon, so our ability to gain strength form one another to fight the best we can will come into play very soon.

   <LI><B>Saturday 2nd, February 2002 - Plane of Hate</b><BR>
The plane of Hate was our playground for the day. Well, I say our playground but it was more of a war zone.<p>
We attempted a zone in break, and as usual our luck held for about 3 seconds before glorious chain aggro meant we got half the cleric population of the floor making their way to say hello.<BR>
Well, now the greetings were out the way, the newly rezzed parties formed up at the SW corner. Things went distinctly more smoothly from here on in. Although since this was our first time pulling Hate we did not move as quickly as perhaps we could.<BR>
We cleared the 3 nearby buildings in the SW corner, then proceeded to clear the large cleric building. Soon we changed direction and started to clear the maestros chapel. Eventually that building too was cleared, culminating in the kill of the mini-boss (named abhorrent). Maestro himself was not there to greet us, instead he just left a friendly hand to play the organ.<BR>
We continued to pull a bit of the south east corner, and finished off the main cleric building. But we had been taking our time and it seemed a good point to finish. It felt good to play in Hate. Hopefully soon we will get to play there again.
