         <P align=left>&nbsp;</P>
         <H4 align="left"> Above all - HAVE FUN! The ultimate purpose of the Fellowship 
           is to enhance the enjoyment of EverQuest for those of us who play it...whether 
           this be by helping someone out with a heal or a buff, to achieve an 
           item they have been questing for or simply to be there to talk to. </H4>
         <H4 align="left">All new members will need to read the Fellowship's Charter 
           and agree to these rules before they are accepted into the Fellowship. 
           They will then be considered on probation for their first month, during 
           which time the guild can get to know them and visa versa. It is also 
           asked that new members sign up on our message board and make a habit 
           of checking the board at least twice a week regarding current guild 
           events. All members are asked to register their characters and alts 
           at guildmagic.com so they may be listed on our roster. All alts are 
           welcome to join (after new members have finished their probationary 
           period) but will not be invited into the guild by an officer until they 
           have registered at guildmagic.</H4>
         <H4 align="left"> We will only accept applications from characters that 
           have achieved the minimum level of 6. We feel it is necessary for a 
           new player to become familiar with the basic mechanics of the game and 
           the structure of the world before attempting to join into a guild. However, 
           if someone is an experienced player, having another character(s) above 
           level 6, and wishes to enter our guild with a new character, we will 
           accept their application. </H4>
         <H4 align="left">Members shall conduct themselves in a mature manner, 
           rude and antisocial behavior does not befit being in The Fellowship. 
           Playing an evil character does not give you the right to be mean and 
           abusive. The use of vulgar or foul language in open text (ie: /OOC, 
           /SHOUT, /AUCTION, or regular /SAY's where a third party/parties could 
           hear it) will not be tolerated, and repeated offences could be grounds 
           for dismissal from the guild. </H4>
         <H4 align="left">Harassment of another player will not be tolerated. If 
           a dispute arises between a guild member and another character, for whatever 
           reason, and it can not be resolved by either party, then the guild member 
           should then /Ignore the offending character and, if necessary, report 
           the reason for the dispute to a GM. Under no circumstances should the 
           arguement be taken to /OOC or /SHOUT channels. </H4>
         <H4 align="left">The practice known as "kill stealing" will also not be 
           tolerated. That is to say, the intentional taking of a kill from someone 
           else who was fighting it first. This is an ambiguous area, and common 
           sense and respect for others in a group situation must be used. When 
           you arrive in a new zone you wish to camp in, ask for a camp check. 
           Then if upon reaching the camp that you presume empty only to find a 
           camp, send a tell to ask if they are camping as they may have missed 
           the afore mentioned camp check request. If you are the victim of kill 
           stealing, do not use /OOC or /SHOUT to deal with the problem, send a 
           tell to the person and let them know you are camping that area. If they 
           continue to Ksteal, petition a GM. Please remember that wandering creatures 
           are uncampable and you are only entitled to it if it aggros you first 
           or you lay the first blow. </H4>
         <H4 align="left">Under no conditions is it acceptable to play using tactics 
           that are considered "dirty" or "unfair". This includes such practises 
           as 'ninja looting', buying low/selling high, and/or 'loot hogging'. 
           This is not helping anyone but that person, not to mention it takes 
           advantage of other players. As should go without saying, your actions 
           reflect on the guild as a whole, and therefore, you should act in a 
           manner that won't adversely affect our image. </H4>
         <H4 align="left">Given that this a Role Playing Game, having the roleplaying 
           tag on is warmly accepted, but under NO circumstances should the /Anonymous 
           tag be used as this takes your guild tag off. If you are not proud of 
           the guild you belong in then you shouldn't have the tag at all and simply 
           type /guildremove while having yourself targeted. </H4>
         <H4>Welcome to The Fellowship of Vazaelle, Seeya in there! </H4>
