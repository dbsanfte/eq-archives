<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3366FF">Purpose:</font><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;</font></font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FFFFFF">
The purpose of our guild is simply this: TO HAVE FUN. This is, after all,
a game! We will always be there to help one another, and we do realize
that sometimes EQ can seem far from fun. It is the purpose of this guild
to make sure that while you are getting your corpse out of a pool of molten
lava, or waiting on a /petition to be answered, you will still have fun
as much as is possible.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3366FF">Requirements:</font><font color="#FFFFFF">
</font></font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FFFFFF">There
aren't many requirements to join this guild. The first is that you must
be level 20 or higher. If you have an Alt that you want to join up, he
or she must remain in /roleplay until they reach the 20th Level. Power
Leveling is acceptable in this guild, though if you are a melee class I
<i>highly
</i>recommend
you resist that temptation, for you will be utterly useless by the time
you are done.&nbsp; A select few exemptions to this rule will exist. Immediate
family and RL Friends of officers can join after level 10.&nbsp; Other
exceptions may be made, but they will need to be approved by me. Any members
under the level of 20 must keep /roleplay on at all times except while
LFG.</font></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FFFFFF">For the next
few weeks, we will be having open enrollment. Any officer can invite any
player that they wish, so long as they are over 20. This is so that we
can get a large base-membership set up. After this period is over, players
must hunt with an officer as least once to be considered.&nbsp; The only
exception is if a member tells me the person is a RL or In-Game friend,
and that they are of good character.&nbsp; But beware, for if they are
not, this will look bad on you. Not that you will be punished for it, but
I may not believe you the next time if your last 3 friends had to be removed
from the guild :-P Officers are free to invite anyone who is backed by
a current member, so long as that member has been in the guild at least
2 weeks.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3366FF">Code of
Conduct:</font><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp; </font></font></b><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FFFFFF">While
I certainly don't anticipate having any problems with my guild members
behaving inappropriately and making the guild look bad in the eyes of non-members,
situations do sometimes arise, and so I will lay out a few very simple
rules here, to try and prevent as many as possible.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><font color="#FFFFFF">1.&nbsp; </font><font color="#3366FF"><u>No
member shall ever knowingly mistreat another player in any way</u>.</font><font color="#FFFFFF">
This will include Stealing Kills, Training, Stealing or Scamming, cursing
at or generally being disrespectful in any way. You should always treat
other players like they were your guild mates, and you should always treat
guild mates like they are your best friends :-)</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><font color="#FFFFFF">2. </font><u><font color="#3366FF">Profanity
is not allowed in guild chat, and is discouraged in any public chat forum</font></u><font color="#FFFFFF">
as it makes the name of The Crystaline Sphere look bad.&nbsp; This includes
/shout,&nbsp; /ooc, /auc and /say. I realize this is not the most popular
rule, but I also already know of a few minors that are members of our guild.
Our guild chat should not cause a member to have to shut off his monitor
when his mother walks in the door. Minor cursing, using minor curse words,&nbsp;
is ok in moderation. But the "F-Bomb", the "P" word, the "S" Word and any
other such utterances will get my attention or that of an officer every
time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3.&nbsp; Violations of these two most basic rules will result in the following:</font></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><font color="#3366FF"><b>First Time</b>:</font><font color="#FFFFFF">
Warning</font></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font><font color="#3366FF"><b>Second Time</b>:</font><font color="#FFFFFF">
Final Warning</font></font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font color="#3366FF">
<b>Third Time</b>:</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> Disbandment from the guild.</font></font>
<center>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#3366FF"><b>*I reserve
the right to remove</b> <b>any member at any time if their actions are
severe enough to warrant it, without warning*</b></font></font></center>

<p><br>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#FFFFFF">Now, all that
being said, i really don't expect to have issues with this. I recruit carefully
and I have only the best people I can find in this guild, and my officers
do the same.&nbsp; If anyone sees a member doing something which soils
the name of this guild, please let us know. Our reputation is THE most
important thing we have, and we will not let it be tarnished.</font></font>
