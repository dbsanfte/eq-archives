I just wanted the peace among friends and our guild family. &nbsp;I am sorry that you feel the way you do...talk to ME about it if it is bothering you. I thought we were friends and as far as all that you just wrote..WOW! &nbsp;I never even said a thing to you and I got dragged in it. &nbsp;WE helped Each other thru lots of emotional topics online and on the phone. Dude, I thought we were bonded...Wow &nbsp;Where's the love? &nbsp;I believe feelings got hurt and now the digs are flying. &nbsp;I would really appreciate it, if we put a stop to it here for the guild's sake. &nbsp;You were an officer in the guild, you know that this is not the place for this. If you really would like to talk to me and work this out... call me, email me, or send me a tell. &nbsp;Good God.. We have been friends for nearly a year now..close friends.. look to the dragon dude...:)
My apologies to the guild for this.... &nbsp;I know that all of you have had an argument at one time or another and realize that most of these accusations flying back and forth are just spit and anger. &nbsp;Those of you who know the 3 of us well.. Know that WE ALL HELP Peeps and WE are ALL Good peeps. &nbsp;The hurt is causing this argument to continue because of these facts..we all keep feeling like we need to defend ourselves..ugh &nbsp;
Let me be the first one here to STOP THIS! &nbsp;I am hoping we can work it out .... Friends don't come easy.

Keep it Precious!

You yourself know this &nbsp;Darla, so sometimes even when it is planned out, &nbsp;i cant make it, &nbsp;just like you and Omare did the other night with Mistmoore.

            <td bgcolor="#FEF7EC"><font face="verdana" color=#4D4131 size=2>Well... well...I am sure you would have expected that I would reply to this.  I truly appreciate the points you gave about helping when YOU have the time, RL and otherwise. When I formed this guild it was requested of me to do so by my friends. So that we would have a fun loving friendly family atmosphere. We all agreed at the last officer meeting to keep the guild in this manner.  I am sorry that the argument happened but truly is was for the reasons previously stated. I was being asked to drop what I was doing and run to help someone on a quest when I had already made plans to help another guildmate on a quest that weekend.  I do love to help and had offered my help the day before to this other guildmate. When I told of my dilemma, mastenn, You got mad and said the other guildmate was mad.  This was not acceptable by me or the two other officers that were on at the time.  It was in my error that I meant to send a tell to mastenn and it went in guild chat. I truly apologize for that. It was to be a private matter.  And shall be from this point on.  I just thought the guild needed to see a reply from me on this matter. <br>I am looking forward to much fun with quests, raids, and just hanging out with everyone.  As far as helping goes... I think we are all on the same page with that.. We should all request when we would like some help But I do not expect anyone to leave a group or hunt they are on if it is not an emergency.  Now If anyone is in trouble and need me on the double.. Count On It!! <br> <br>Keep it Real! <br> <br> <br>(Edited by Darlacene at 11:37 am on June 17, 2001)
