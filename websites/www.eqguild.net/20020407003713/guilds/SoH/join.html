         The Shield of Honor is an Invitation Only guild. What that 
         means is that, while anyone is free to ask for admission, the process 
         is not a quick one--we do not discourage requests, but we are very up 
         front in saying that we are striving for quality of members instead of 
         quantitiy. We have no desire to be the biggest guild in existence, only 
         the best.<br>
         <br>
         With that in mind, there are some qualifications that potential members 
         are required to meet. Those currently agreed on, or under discussion by 
         the Guild council, are as follows:<br>
         <br>
       <font size="+1"><b>Language</b></font><br>
         Firiona Vie is a Role-Playing server. As such, we require that our members 
         refrain from using symbolic English--meaning the substitution of symbols 
         for words, as in &quot;4&quot; for &quot;For&quot; or &quot;U&quot; for 
         &quot;You.&quot; There is no requirement at this time for speaking Archaic 
         English (thee, thou, thusly, etc.) although it is certainly acceptable; 
         we only ask that if such language is used, that the user know the proper 
         manner of using it. In short, normal American English is acceptable, contractions 
         and all, but no slang or offensive phrasing is allowed.<br>
         <br>
       <b><font size="+1">Behavior</font></b><br>
         The theme of our guild is stated clearly in the title: Honor. By saying 
         &quot;Shield of Honor&quot; we are not just promoting a catchy name, but 
         a manner of behaving--honor in all things, both to your guildmates and 
         also to the fellow travelers you meet in the course of the game. Members 
         of this guild are required to act honorably in all ways and at all times. 
         Exactly what is meant by &quot;honor&quot; and &quot;acting honorably&quot; 
         is discussed elsewhere on this site.<br>
         <br>
       <b><font size="+1">Dues</font></b><br>
         While there is not a formal dues system, the guild does have a Treasurer 
         and a general fund. Since that fund is intended to help the membership 
         in its entirety, the entirety of the membership is intended to contribute 
         to it. Contributions can range from old equipment that you no longer need 
         to items that you have looted but cannot use. Cash is also acceptable, 
         but it is realized that in the game--as in real life--there is rarely 
         such a thing as &quot;extra cash.&quot; To make up for this, any donated 
         items that are not claimed will be sold for cash after a set period of 
         time, with that cash going to the general fund. One such donation, large 
         or small, must be made every 2 weeks, nor can extra weeks be bought in 
         advance--2 items cannot be donated simultaneously to cover a full month, 
         for example.<br>
         <br>
       <font size="+1"><b>Registration</b></font><br>
         In order to keep things running as smoothly as possible, the guild makes 
         use of several means of communication and organization. One of these is 
         the guild discussion group, hosted by Yahoo; the group discussion page, 
         including subscription and posting instructions, can be found <b><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Shield_of_Honor" target="resource window">here</a></b>. 
         Another involves the many services offered by Guildmagic.com, where members 
         are required to register characters and keep the information updated; 
         their front page can be reached <b><a href="http://www.guildmagic.com" target="resource window">here</a></b>. 
         Each character is also required to have a profile posted on this site 
         in the Members section; these profiles generally consist of a photo (screenshot 
         or other) of the character plus a brief background--family, friends, likes 
         and dislikes, etc.<br>
         <br>
         Please note that these are not suggestions, they are requirements; the 
         invitation to join will not be extended until they are met. <br>
         <br>
       <font size="+1"><b>Attitude</b></font><br>
         Perhaps the most important factor of all, as well as the hardest to judge, 
         is your attitude. Part of the initiation process is a long period of time 
         during which you will be required to spend time hunting with members of 
         the guild, individually or in groups. The purpose behind this is two-fold: 
         first, so that the guild can get a feel for what you are like, what your 
         attitudes and behaviors are, and whether or not you will fit in as a member; 
         second, so that you can do the same--get a feel for the guild, what our 
         attitudes and behaviors are like, and whether your desires and goals can 
         fit into ours. While the time for this is required, the span is variable; 
         it will never be less than a week of game-time, with the member assessing 
         you being responsible for keeping track of time spent.<br>
         <br>
         <br>
       If this seems like a lot of work and a lot of bother to you, guess what--you 
       are right. The invitation process is intentionally long, drawn-out, and 
       filled with details that only someone who really wants to be a member will 
       put up with...becaue that is the sort of person we want, and that is the 
       sort of guild we are building. If all of this seems to be too much, you 
       are in the wrong place; there are plenty ofd casual guild in existence, 
       and one of them is for you. If, on the other hand, you are serious about 
       your gaming and in your desire to acheive the fullest, richest, and most 
       entertaining experience possible...then we are pleased to meet you, and 
       more than willing to give you the chance.<br>
