<b>Join Rules:</b><br><br>

§1: You must be able to speak and write in the danish language.<br><br>

§2: All members have to be available to play in the same time periods (GMT1).<br><br>

§3: All that apply for a membership in Northern Tribe will have a trial period
    of one week where it is decided whether or not the individual is NT material.<br><br><br>


<b>Guild Behaviour Rules:</b><br><br>

§1: As a member of Northern Tribe you behave in an orderly manner and try your best
    to keep danish at a mininum when speaking in /ooc, /shout, etc.<br><br>

§2: Guildmembers are there to help each other, but this does NOT mean they will
    drop everything to help you with: ports, PL, etc.
    Ask don't beg.<br><br>

§3: Equipment is primarily obtained from trades and loot, do not expect guildies
    to give you anything or be your "bank", if there is something you want/need
    plan a raid and ask the guild to aid you, that is what playing this game is
    all about.<br><br>

§4: Avoid discussions/arguments in /shout that would annoy and irritate other players.<br><br>
    This is not the way we want to be known as a guild.

§5: You will NOT kill steal or ninja loot on purpose.<br><br><br>

<b>Raid Rules:</b><br><br>

§1: A raid consists of a raid leader and a number of group leaders.
    Unless loot is No Drop it will be collected by the group leaders and
    distributed to the players that need it at the end of the raid.<br><br>

 §1.1: If loot is No Drop there will be an on spot random by the people
       that can use it.<br><br>

 §1.2: On raids that are hosted by Northern Tribe the loot will be distributed
       by Northern Tribe's raid leader.<br><br>

§2: A Northern Tribe raid leader has the right to remove a member of the raid 
    if this individual is destructive, or in any way brings the other raid members
    in unnecesary danger.<br><br>

 §2.1: Always listen to the raid leader as he has the full responsibility of the raid.<br><br>

 §2.2: Only group leaders are allowed to send /tells to the raid leader when the raid has
       started.<br><br>

§3: EXP is not the main objective of a raid so do not expect to get any.<br><br>

 §3.1: The main objective of a Northern Tribe raid is to get better equipment
       and/or quest items for one or more members of the guild. Do not be selfish
       if you are there for the guild, the guild will be there for you, which is
       what makes the guild strong.<br><br><br><br>


 <b>~Not following these rules will end in warnings or even getting disbanded from the guild~</b>
