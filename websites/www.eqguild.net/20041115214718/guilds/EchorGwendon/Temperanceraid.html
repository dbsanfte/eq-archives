<P><font size="4">Temperance Raid Quest, 14th June 2003</font>
<p>The raid started about a half hour after the designated start time.  Kindra, Phalgor, Yirrlaar, Ndretti, Banaorn, and Suivas participated in the raid.  The ship Dandy was camped.  In just over an hour, the “an Deepwater emblem” dropped.  The raid continued for about another 45 minutes and the raid group decided to complete the second half.  After reorganizing the group and getting on the correct side of the beach, an erudite spirit was up.  Phalgor lead Yirrlaar and Kindra to the spirit and it happened to be the correct spirit for the cleric spell quest.</p>
<BR>The raid group decided to camp the beach to get the two items needed for the ranger spell.  Yirr informed Phal that the beach needed to be cleared for the correct spawns to occur.  Phal returned with the entire beach mob population in which Yirr replied “I didn’t say the entire beach at once.”  It was a long battle, Phalgor and Yirrlaar happened to die in the battle and the survivors were waist deep in corpses.  Yirr had to eventually leave and Phalgor left a bit later but the two items were looted and Ban got his new ranger spell; Swarm of Pain.
<BR>So in just over 5 hours, to spell quests were completed.  Only 2 deaths, one AA achieved and 2 dings (I believed it was 2).
<BR>Up next, hopefully, will be a long camp for the druid drops for their spells (need 4).  And a memo to all players, be specific on how you want Phalgor to pull (hehehe).
