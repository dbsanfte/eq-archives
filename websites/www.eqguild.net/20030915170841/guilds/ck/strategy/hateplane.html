 Summary:
 <ol>
 <li>Gather <b>Before</b> startup time in zone "South Ro" at the tiny pyramid.
 <li><b>Bind yourself here</b> if you are a bindable class.  If a bad wipe occurs you can then be invited by the wizard for port up CR.
 <li>If you are bringing multiple chars get each of them to the port up site.
 <li>Turn on LFG. Then send a Tell to the groupmaker with your class and level. (Yes they probably know you but this makes it easier for them)
 <li>Group maker constructs groups of 5. These are port up groups only. Extra spot is left for a wizard to join and perform the portup.
 <li>All buffing occurs with longer lasting bufs. Haste and such can wait until just before portup or in zone.
 
 <li>Port up Time:
 <ol type="a">
 <li>Everyone in group gets See invisible and invisible.
 <li>The porting wizard is invited to your group.
 <li>The portup occurs.
 <li>The wizard disbands, then gates down to repeat with another group.
 </ol>
 
 <li>If a CoH mage is available (Call of Heroes)
 <ol type="a">
 <li><b>Everyone</b> disbands from port-up group immediately.
 <li>Turn on LFG.
 <li>Each person is invited to join the mage's group at the portup site. Usually by a rogue who stays at portup.
 <li>Each person is summoned to Camp #1.
 <li>Each person then disbands yet again from CoH group.
 <li>Turn on LFG.
 </ol>
 
 <li>With no CoH available...Refer to map and Tormac's directions to get to camp #1. Do NOT get too high on wall.
 <li>If you are bringing more than one raid capable char, you would camp now and log that char on.
 <li><b>Pay Attention</b> At this point the guild has invested at least 60-70 plat in your being at the raid. Multiply this by the number of people. AFK or not at keyboard could cause a wipe.  
 </ol>
 
 
 <b>By Tormac-</b><br>
 Zone In:
 <p>There is one way into the plane of Hate. A Wizard of 46 seasons must be there to port an entire group of 6 up. This costs 200 pp per gem stone (per group) and is why its important to pay attention to raid beginning times and to be prepared. Everyone needs to gather in south ro desert at the wizard teleport pad (the pyramid thingie). This is a neutral place where all races/classes can gather safely.
 
 <p>You will be put in groups, but be aware these groups are for nothing more then the porting up and running to the safe location in Hate. Once you are in the camp you will log off and log on a 2nd char and wait until all port ups are complete and the raid leaders asks for people to log back in. If you happen to die please consent the raid rogues and monks and they will move yer body to the safe camp spot for a res after all ports are finished. (and please understand there is a greater then 50% chance you WILL die especially if this is yer first trip up) 
 
 <p>Once you are ported up you appear in the plane of hate in the building on the very SE corner of the map. The 1st port group usually consists of monks and rogues so they are there to spot for when the wanderers are near the zone in point and to coordinate port ups. Basically we want to get from the SE corner to the SW corner and slightly north of that to a safe spot known as camp #1 (should be marked on yer map). Inviso works on some of the mobs but not for others which is why its important to be aware of where you are heading so that you can concentrate on making the camping spot.
 
 <p>When you port in you are facing south, step forward 4 steps make a right turn (you will be facign west) move forward to the wall and turn to yer right (you should now be facing north). this is the exit of the port in house that you spawned in. move north through the archway and just a couple of steps more there is a way to go to the right. (remember if you are making a left turn for any reason you are no longer on the correct path. stop.... retrace yer steps and if you die make sure to get yer loc.) Turn right (facing east now) go east until the wall (bout 8 steps). Turn right again (You will be facing south now). Do not worry this looks like a dead end (and it should) this is ok proceed south to the wall and continue up and climb the wall about half way to the roof top. Turn to the right (you are now facing west) While on the wall (half way from the floor to the roof) proceed west for a long way. Feel free to stop if you see a mob there and wait for it to move, but I dont suggest waiting too long. When you reach the corner turn one last time to the right (north). You will notice the building to your side is on a diagonal... continue north half way up the wall past the diagonal facing building in the corner and stop before the next building. This is the camp spot. Sit down and log off and wait for instructions. It is litterally 2-3 seconds of movement when you turned to face north to where the camp is, and if yer not the first group then more then likely you will see bodies on the ground of those who have died.
 
 
 Tips:
 
 <ol>
 <li>Protect the cleric in yer port in group. If the cleric dies noone will be left to res. This means clerics should not be leading the charge and if a mob gets on the port in group every other person (except the cleric) should tie up the mob on the wall for as long as possible creating an opportunity for the cleric to continue to the camp and get logged off. Once you have aggro do not take the mobs to the camping spot, stop and take the death, you can try and root the mob and log off to clear aggro but more then likely this wil not succeed.
 
 <li>Understand that the goal of a planes trip is to have fun and to work together as an elite fighting team and get some nice planer gear for all. Experience means nothing there and if you are looking to advance the level of yer character then you shouldnt be in the planes.
 
 <li>Make an assist key and use it exclusively. The battle will not be won or lost if you swing 1 time less or shoot one less spell because you verified your target, but it surely will fail if you mistarget.
 
 <li>Listen and respect your raid leaders and coordinators. Planes can be very stressful and attention must be given to the raid to ensure the success. Any questions you have I suggest asking your group leader and if they do not know your answer they can forward it to the raid coordinator.
 
 <li>Spite golems are magic resitant. About the only spell that lands is dispell and the wizard lure lines, although I hear some of the very high level classes are able to land some things now. If you are a caster save yer mana to heal tanks and assist the melee in any way possible because they will be the deciding factor when killign the golems.
 
 <li>the evil Clerics have complete heal. One cleric can torture a group if it is not stunned and knocked out quickly at the end of the fight before it heals. 2-3 evil clerics and there is a good chance people are gonna die horribly. They resist mezzes quite often and will heal any creature you have aggroed.
 
 <li>the camp spot is small. Casters should line up along the base of the wall but NEVER on the wall. If you climb too high on the wall you will aggro death from above (Hate has 2 floors and there are mobs directly above our camp spot.) Leave the small area of floorspace to the melee so they can surround mobs.
 
 <li>If a mob gets forced up the side of the wall stop attacking and pull it down. If a mob gets too high it will aggro the floor above and the entire raid runs the risk of wipeout.
 
 <li>No area spells or bard songs. I have no clue if this has changed for bards but bard mana songs and the such can be deadly if any single person of the bards group is on the wall (where they shouldnt be) the bard can quickly pass aggro to their remainign group members. 
 
 <li>have fun and dont worry. I know I just made this huge post and there are alot of instructions here, but dont worry. There are a good few people in the guild that are well learned in the ways of the planes, put yer trust in them to guide you. I posted this stuff now to give people a chance to understand just what we are undertaking on tuesday so everything isnt a complete surprise.
