<br>
And in all honesty I do not understand the objective.  <br>
<br>
Packs ? I wouldn't say I was part of the 'pack' whatever that may be.   Is this crucifying someone for something they did ?  <br>
in EQ it maybe a little OTT, but there again it maybe retribution for what's been done.  <br>
<br>
I am talking about people like Obsidianx, which by your own admission you found interesting.  In this instance, would you not consider yourself part of the 'pack' even though you may or may not have commented.  <br>
<br>
Then you go on to say talk about children etc and jail.  Sorry, hell that's life. Some have it easy, some do not.  I do not consider myself to have had an easy life at all - but there again I would not cry over the past, I would only consider moving forward.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry for your situation, but your own path has been carved by yourself.  Granted its not always entirely in your control, but in the same breath I would not expect anyone to be sorry for me either.  <br>
<br>
Then you go on about some guy in prison, your son ???? again he chose his own path.  You can guide your children, but you cannot force them down a path.   Irrespective of how much you try and influence (brainwash/influence - I dunno) you again have no control over his situation.  <br>
<br>
From the sound of it, you don't need EQ ... you need to be with your family and friends.<br>
<br>
P.S. I have no real clue if this post is serious or not, it tends to go on a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utalasarfearghus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talasar Fearghus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/23/02 12:28:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why Jynn Left</span><hr size=1> Raluvin,<br>

Everything Jynn posted here is explaining something that she had posted before and since deleted that she was either flamed about or whatever other reason she decided to delete them.  I think if you had actually been able to or had read the posts that are now gone, you would understand this one alot better.  It all is relevant and makes sense having that background.  It's a point of view, not a discussion, read it for what it is.  Someone putting their feelings on the table because they felt the board is biased towards a specific group of people, not a board that is &quot;The official Quellious Server&quot; board.  That is the group she is talking about, no one in game. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>

<br>
I assure you I am not looking for symapthy in real life or in this game or on this board.  I relate the prison incident for  three reasons.  Number one, some people seem to think I view myself a super parent and am trying to put down others.  I'm not.  I have been a miserable failure in many respects and if I came off sounding superior, I apologize for that.  Two, if I keep a close eye on the third child it isn't because I'm obsessed, it's because I know exactly how quickly things can go downhill.  Third the jokes about prison gang rape aren't amusing to me and now you know why.  BTW the context of the jokes wasn't about rapists, child molesters or drug czars, it was about Sendole and the rest of the twirps who are jacking accounts and running scams.<br>
<br>
Yes, I've made my own choices and so did my son and we live with them and learn from them and I am not crying in my beer about them.  It's over and done and we are all moving on.  I didn't say anything about the Gacy joke even though I probably had more cause to say something than most of you.  I'm really not that sensitive that I am constantly drudging up my past.  I am certainly not asking for anyone to feel sorry for me.<br>
<br>
Actually, I spend quite a lot of time with my family and friends.  The only way I can spend more is if I go to school or to his friend's house to spend the night with my son and he would probably frown on that.  That's why I have a job where I can work at home.  I also happen to play EQ with family and friends so quitting EQ really wouldn't make me any closer to any of them.  He's trying to get me to play Morrowind so the games aren't really an escape for us, just a form of entertainment.<br>
<br>
As far as me being in on the pack over Obsidienx, I've had dealings with her and will freely admit I don't like her or others of the same character.  I would hope there is a difference between the way I am perceived in the game and her.  I've worked pretty hard to present an honorable persona whereas I don't really think she cares about honor or scruples.<br>
<br>
As I said in the beginning.  I had hoped this post would lay any questions to rest so Dahlea can get off the hot seat.<br>
