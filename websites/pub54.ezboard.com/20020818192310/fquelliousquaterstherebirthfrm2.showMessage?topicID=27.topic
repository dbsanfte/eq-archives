Near the drake ridge she encountered the two she was to meet.  Saldaria knelt down on the ground, presumably engaged in a meditative trance or spirit jaunt.  Valdayana sat higher up on the slope of a foothill looking down at them both.<br><br>  &quot;Hi.&quot;  Valdayana poked her in response.  Habitually, Millikin scanned the area.  A few giant fire beetles scurried by, and she smelled the brimstone discharge of an obsidian drake's breath weapon, but the sphinx known as Ankhefenmut was nowhere to be seen at the moment.<br><br>  &quot;Go kill hill giants.  I need money for peridots.&quot;  Valdayana demanded after a long silence and it appeared Saldaria was not going to awaken from her trance any time soon.  Ill tempered and xenophobic, the hill giants of the Rathe Mountains savagely attacked anyone unfortunate to cross their path.  For those capable of defending themselves against such attacks, or actively sought to cull the abundant giant population, they found that hill giants often carried a substantial amount of money and items (Likely claimed from previous victims.) that would fetch a good price to vendors.<br><br>  &quot;Hill giants don't typically wander in this part of the mountains.  There are drakes though.  Wait a minute ... do I look like your servant or something?&quot;  Millikin paused in her discourse of the habitat choices of the various creatures that inhabited Rathe Mountains when the realization hit her that she was being ordered around.<br><br>  &quot;Yes.&quot;  Valdayana replied.<br><br>  &quot;Then I want a regular salary if you're going to go around telling people I'm your servant.&quot;  Millikin glanced over at Saldaria who remained unmoving.<br><br>  &quot;You do.  I rune you when you're about to die and then you whine about it.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;That is not a regular salary and I am in no danger of dying to a hill giant here.&quot;  Millikin responded.<br><br>  &quot;I'm not the one saying you're my servant, you are.&quot;  Valdayana replied.<br><br>  &quot;What??&quot;  Millikin stared in surprise.  <br><br>  &quot;I'll even directly quote you.  ' I look like your servant.' &quot;<br><br>  &quot;That is NOT a direct quote.  I said  ' Wait a minute ... do I look like your servant or something.' &quot;  Millikin was taken aback that what she said would so deliberately and blatantly twisted in such an obvious manner.<br><br>  &quot;Go out and kill some hill giants anyway.&quot;  Valdayana waved dissuasively at the ranger.<br><br>  &quot;I told you, they don't wander around here.  They live in a valley not too far from here.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;You have two legs.  Walk.&quot;  Valdayana countered curtly.<br><br>     Millikin grumbled as she took stock of the arrows in her quiver and strung her bow to use.  After a few minutes, she turned to leave, intending to do exactly as demanded, lure a hill giant to this area and slay it, when Valdayana called out.<br><br>  &quot;Good.  If you hadn't left soon, I'd have had to curse you.&quot;  <br><br>Millikin stopped dead in her tracks.  There were many things she would tolerate (to a point) from the arrogant enchanter, including insults and being peremptorily ordered around like a lackey.  Direct threats were another matter altogether.<br><br>  &quot;That's it.&quot;  The ranger turned around and walked back, unstringing her bow in the process.<br><br>  &quot;What's it?&quot;  Valdayana inquired.  <br><br>  &quot;Hunt your own hill giants.&quot;  Millikin sat down on the ground, intent on not moving until Saldaria returned to full consciousness.<br><br>  &quot;Didn't you hear me threaten to curse you, ranger?&quot; <br><br>  &quot;You know, your voodoo doll is still out there missing somewhere.  But I dare you to.&quot;  Millikin sniffed derisively.  <br><br>  &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot;  Valdayana poked her in the shoulder.  <br><br>  &quot;How about this...  I double dare you.&quot;  She glared at the dark elf.  <br><br>  &quot;Remember, you asked for this.&quot;  <br><br>     A faint inflection of amusement could be detected in the enchanter's intonation as she traced an arcane pattern in midair in cadence with the incantation.  Eldritch energy flickered around the ranger's body, akin to witchlight.  Valdayana's mage sight permitted her to observe that the ranger momentarily transform into a red implike creature before the aura dissipated with the illusion.  For her own part, Millikin felt a strange burning sensation course through her body that quickly subsided.  In the distance, Millikin heard the yipping bark of a coyote almost like a mocking laugh.<br><br>  &quot;Hm.  Your appearance improved momentarily.  The spell may have backfired.&quot;  Valdayana looked appraisingly at the ranger.  Millikin looked down at herself but didn't see anything out of the ordinary and shrugged.  Saldaria came out of her meditative trance and did not give any indication that she was aware that the two of them had been quarreling.  <br>  <br>  &quot;Shall we set about to our hunt?&quot;  <br><br>     Soon the three of them headed for the temple dedicated to Cazic Thule, meeting up with Draugrim, Senwen, and Ashwith to hunt the raptors and lizard guards that prowled the area.  Employing magic to conceal herself with her surroundings, Millikin wandered the grounds to bait would-be predators into an ambush.  She noticed that her camouflage did not ever dissipate until she took action to break it.  <br><br>Later...<br><br>Millikin willed herself to transform into a wolf and swiftly ran through the Innothule swamp towards the borders of the Ro Desert.  The ranger mentally willed herself to transform to her natural form.  Nothing happened.  Startled, she made for the southern desert and still the transformation had not dissipated.  <br><br>  &quot;What is this?&quot;  Millikin recited a cantra to attempt to dispel the wolf form, to no avail.  Running through the desert with a fur coat was not an appealing prospect to the ranger but it looked like she had little choice.  She made her way to the Commonlands and still the wolf guise had not broken.  Once more she heard a coyote yipping and the blood in her veins froze for a moment.  <br><br>  &quot;Wonderful.  What exactly is this curse?&quot;  Millikin muttered to herself.  Eventually the magical energies that permitted the transformation were spent and the ranger reverted to her natural form.  &quot;I'll find out soon enough.&quot;<br><br>----------<br><br>Saldaria Snowspirit is the sole property of her creator and used only for role playing purposes with prior consent.

A bed that looked unused, a locked trunk at the foot of the bed, travel gear stowed on the trunk, some dishes stacked neatly on a counter, a wooden table and four chairs.  How anyone could possess such spartan taste in decor was personally beyond her.  Then again, it was the temporary residence of a ranger.  Rangers were rarely accused of accumulating a great deal of material wealth or possessing extravagant style or taste and the aforementioned ranger, currently sitting at the table, who chose to reside here was no exception.<br><br>  &quot;How do you undo that curse?&quot;  Millikin stood up at the arrival of the dark elf, trying to keep the note of accusation from her tone.<br><br>  &quot;What curse?&quot;  Valdayana looked curiously over at Millikin.  Despite the ranger's mercurial nature, the Teir`Dal was often successful in deliberately shifting the ranger's mood to another of the enchanter's preference with a few words.  It was a diversion she found more entertaining when the Tunarean ranger was making an effort to guard against being drawn into mind games.  Provoking her to anger right now would be too easy, so Valdayana refrained from commenting that the Feir`Dal's very existence could be construed as a curse.<br><br>  &quot;What curse?  You know perfectly well what curse.&quot;  Millikin paced back and forth impatiently.<br><br>  &quot;Ah yes.  Perhaps if you hunted hill giants like I asked you to.&quot;  Valdayana suggested after a few moments' pause.<br><br>  &quot;Asked?!  You don't 'ask' for anything.  Ever.&quot;  Millikin halted mid-step and turned an incredulous gaze to the dark elf.<br><br>  &quot;I kindly ask that you stop with your wild accusations against me as they only reveal you to be an intellectual degenerate and completely lacking in refinement.&quot;  Valdayana replied calmly.<br><br>  &quot;Refinement is overrated.&quot;  Millikin sniffed.  &quot;As for wild accusations, you threatened to curse me.&quot;  <br><br>  &quot;Next time you'll listen when I tell you to do something, instead of being disrespectful.&quot;  Valdayana watched emotionlessly as Millikin resumed pacing.<br><br>  &quot;I was going to, until you threatened me.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Then perhaps you should have thought of that before you decided to try me.&quot;  Valdayana clasped her hands behind her back.  &quot;I might remove the curse when I feel like you've learned your lesson.  I might not if you remain unrepentant.&quot;<br><br>     Millikin blinked in surprise.  She did not belong to any organization where the enchanter could claim privilege of command over her by virtue of rank. (Not that Millikin acknowledged rank in and of itself as granting authority over her person anyway.  Furthermore, she had a tendency to ignore people who act like rank alone entitled them to respect.)  And the ranger was fairly certain that she was neither a protégée nor ward of Valdayana D`Varr. (The mere thought of being either caused the ranger to lose several hours' sleep later that night.)  The ranger had directly experienced at the hands of the enchanter that the morality of an action was never a consideration as to whether or not she should do something.  Now, all of a sudden she's claiming a 'moral prerogative'?  So Millikin was at a loss as to what reasoning the Teir`Dal would have to explain what authority she possessed to assume the role of the ranger's disciplinarian.  <br><br>     Millikin quickly decided that arguing along those lines at this time would likely prove fruitless.  'She'd probably just claim being my elder gives her the right anyway.'  Unlike the concept of rank, age usually garnered a modicum of deferential respect from the wood elf ranger. (Those whose age greatly exceeded her own were few and far between.) At least until it was abused or the individual proved to be unworthy of such respect.  But even with that aside, Millikin grew up in an environment where the concept of curses, whiddershins, and various other superstitions were not uncommon.  Millikin's eyes narrowed suspiciously as she gazed at Valdayana who met the look with unequivocal stoicism. <br><br>  &quot;That's not how it works, you know.&quot;  Millikin watched Valdayana for several moments.  &quot;You're supposed to outline the terms of how the curse can be broken when you establish it, or it backfires on the invoker.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Since you're going to dictate to me how magic works,&quot; Valdayana stated dryly.  &quot;I'm sure you'll find your own way out of your mess.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;You shouldn't have placed it on me in the first place.&quot;  Millikin frowned.  <br><br>  &quot;It doesn't appear to have backfired on me... so maybe you should think about what I said earlier?&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Are you telling me you've managed to circumvent laws of balance?&quot;<br><br>  &quot;I have more important things to do than prattle with you.  After everything I've done for you, you remain ungrateful.&quot;  The luhtmauyar replied.<br><br>  &quot;Ungrateful?!?&quot;  <br><br>  &quot;Well, you are.  I'm leaving.  You can figure things out on your own.&quot;  That said, a swirl of mist quickly enveloped the enchanter and she disappeared from sight.<br><br>----------<br><br>Valdayana D`Varr is the sole property of her creator and used only for role playing purposes with prior consent.

In the land of milk and honey, you must put them on the table.&quot;   -- Steely Dan<br><br><br>Interlude<br>Authors:  Esmalyn (pseudonym)    Millikin Erreene (pseudonymn)<br><br>After shaking the strange feeling from her hands after her latest attempt at spellcasting, Millikin strolled over to the amphitheater for duels in the Bazaar.  She had seen a certain rogue lurking in the crowds earlier, likely picking through the pockets of the unwary.  Whistling to herself, her hand closed around a note she kept folded up in her pocket that reminded her of why she was seeking out Esmalyn now that her other preparations were underway.<br><br>Cheers erupted to signal the end of a match as several runners moved out with a stretcher to remove the troll warrior lying on the ground, an arrow imbedded in his side.  Roses were thrown to the feet of the victor as he bowed gallantly on his way out to make room for the next combatants.  The ranger caught sight of her quarry, currently dawdling up the stands, her cloak whispering over the marble. Once the Tier'Dal decided on a seat, Millikin casually walked up whistling.  Esmalyn's keen hearing discerned the notes of the tune and while she didn't know it by name, she knew the ranger who was fond of whistling it from time to time.<br><br>&quot;Vendui, elg' hasek,&quot; the Tier'Dal rogue sighed at her approach.  &quot;Lu'oh phuul dos?&quot; <br><br>&quot;I'm doing well.  And yourself?&quot;  Millikin continued whistling, knowing perfectly well Esmalyn did not really care how she was, but she went along with the minor civilities for the time being.<br><br>&quot;I was well.&quot;  Esmalyn finally bothered to look over at the Feir`Dal, red eyes flickering.  &quot;Why have you come here?  You reek of marsh and grass.&quot;<br><br>Millikin took a deep breath.  Finally the formalities have dispensed, down to business.<br><br>&quot;Actually it's pine, not like you would be able to recognize the scent, but to cut to the chase, I need something from you.  You know of the Shissar, I presume?  At least of their existence, general appearance, and capabilities.<br><br>Esmalyn reached up and pushed back her hood. Shoulder-length, white hair spilled out. &quot;They worm around The Grey, that airless plain.&quot;  She paused for a moment.  &quot;You are desperate.&quot; <br><br>The sound of cymbals announced the start of a new match and Millikin turned to regard the latest combatants.  Two wizards were currently in the process of summoning energies to launch their attack.  Formal bets were called and coins changed hands.<br><br>&quot;Not hardly,&quot; Millikin replied.  &quot;Simply asking you is what's most convenient at this time.&quot;  She did not turn to face the rogue until after the first wave of flaming rain descended upon one of the wizards scorching the ground but leaving him relatively unscathed.  &quot;I need a fast acting and fatal poison capable of killing a Shissar introduced by arrow or sword edge.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is new territory.  How much is this poison worth to you?&quot;  Esmalyn turned her attention back to the wizards' duel.<br><br>&quot;I have components already to work with,&quot; Millikin replied. <br><br>&quot;Is this a trap you have in store for me, payback for breaking into your flat?&quot; Esmalyn asked, sliding her gaze over to the Feir`Dal once more.<br><br>&quot;No.  But since you brought that up...&quot; Millikin paused momentarily before continuing.  Though the ranger still continued her association on occasion with the rogue, Millikin had not forgotten (or forgiven) the incident where the dark elf thief had sneaked into her room and stolen a medallion piece from her.  The ranger simply bided her time, knowing eventually one day Esmalyn would be rewarded in full measure for her deceit.  As far as the enchanter who had hired Esmalyn for the task, Millikin considered that her role was rewarded as deserved at the hands of the ranger.<br><br>&quot;... I would be willing to forget about your role in it if you can manage to make this poison.  The Luhtmauyar D`Varr was not so fortunate.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Luhtmauyar D`Varr should not let her self-worth impair her judgment.  You have not worked up the nerve to strike back at me.  Tell me, lorulm darthirii, how has this changed?&quot;  Despite her words of bravado, the Teir`Dal rogue went taut as she looked up in appraisal of the ranger.<br><br>&quot;I could strike back at this very instance.  Or tomorrow.  Or next week.  I have the time,&quot; Millikin replied evenly.  <br><br>&quot;I'll keep that in mind.&quot;  Esmalyn returned her attention to the fight.  Her facial expression schooled to neutrality as she relaxed somewhat.<br><br>&quot;But I'm aware that you were simply one of Valdayana's flunkies, carrying out her orders.&quot;  Millikin took a tone of feigned innocent understanding.  &quot;Faced with the prospect of getting paid or risking her ire, most people of your caliber would take the money too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;One of us is gaining notoriety as a lackey, lorulm darthirii, and I don't intend to travel down that path.&quot;  Esmalyn turned once again to look over at the ranger, the scar over her eye accentuating the sneer twisting her lips as she responded.  &quot;Either pay a wage or seek another pathetic rogue to do your bidding free of charge.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Are you even capable of making such a poison?  Aside from the fact that you do little more than steal from those you work with, I'm wondering if you are up to the task.  You can't even pilfer from a fungusbeast without getting caught.&quot;  Millikin couldn't resist adding the last statement for emphasis.  She could tell by Esmalyn's sudden vagueness that the comment struck a chord.<br><br>&quot;I am versed in amounts, combinations; plants and fungi.  Injected, swallowed, or applied.  I could --&quot;  She paused, a bemused grin on her face.  &quot;You couldn't even keep a common thief from ransacking your home.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You didn't ransack 'my' home.&quot;  Millikin replied dryly.  The ranger did not consider the rented room in Shadowhaven her home by any stretch nor was she going to allow the rogue to think any jab she took to provoke her would have any effect or distract from the business at hand.  Either she could make the poison or she could not.  She had little time to continue this game of point-counterpoint.  &quot;Nor did you answer the question.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Don't interrupt me.&quot;  Esmalyn leaned back and looked up at Millikin.  &quot;I am capable of such a poison, although, I can't offer a set time.  A week at the most.&quot;<br><br>&quot;A week at most to make it?&quot;  Millikin inquired.  Esmalyn nodded.  Millikin was not satisfied.  &quot;Five or seven days in Norrathian time?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Seven days in a Norrathian week, unless you've attuned yourself to Luclin's cycles beyond repair.&quot;  Esmalyn idly wondered if Millikin was representative of her race in overall stupidity.<br><br>&quot;I'm making sure the time frame is clear as water.&quot;  Millikin remarked, she was not going to be conned about Luclin versus Norrath time frames due to the lack of standard recognizable cycles of day and night on Norrath's moon.  &quot;How much?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Fifty platinum.  I know how thrifty you are.  Don't ask how, and doubt you carry more than ten gold on your person right now.&quot;  Esmalyn didn't miss a beat where money was concerned.  She pointed behind the ranger in the direction of the bank.  &quot;Half up front, the other half at production.  We can make a transfer at the bank now if you wish.&quot;  The rogue stood up to leave.<br><br>&quot;What guarantee do I have it will work?&quot;  Millikin narrowed her eyes.  &quot;I don't particularly care for the prospect of paying fifty platinum for colored water.&quot;<br><br>Esmalyn smirked and she canted her head to the side in response.  &quot;Presuming your samples are relatively fresh and I have enough to spare for a test, you can witness it in action yourself. You can even volunteer to have it tested on yourself, which, I wouldn't protest.&quot;  She walked past the ranger, quite confident in her position regarding this transaction.<br><br>The ranger did not think the suggestion of a simple poison test was enough.  &quot;I need it to kill Shissar, not some rat you picked up in the sewers you roam.&quot;  <br><br>&quot;We can test it on a Shissar.  I don't promise more than I can deliver.  Valdayana could tell you that.&quot;  Esmalyn replied over her shoulder.<br><br>&quot;A moment...&quot;  Millikin paused then continued.  &quot;One third now.  The remaining two-thirds after the test sample proves worthwhile.  And you make it in three days... for sixty-five platinum.&quot;  <br><br>&quot;Seventy platinum.&quot;  Esmalyn stopped and shifted her weight to turn midstep.  &quot;Materials, an alchemist if I need to hire one, trips to and from the Grey.&quot;  She ticked these off on her fingers.  &quot;Seventy platinum.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It doesn't cost anything to reach the Grey.  And I'm supplying the materials already.&quot;  Millikin argued.<br><br>&quot;You are rushing me.  I cannot account for accidents, however that may please you, or shortages from quick samples.  Seventy platinum for three days or fifty for seven.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Could you manage an accident after the test?  It would save me about forty-six platinum.&quot;  The ranger doesn't even bother to hide her grin.<br><br>&quot;Dark powers help me, I can think of the perfect accident.&quot;  Esmalyn's poignant gaze fell upon the ranger.<br><br>&quot;So long as its painful for you, I am not overly concerned about perfection,&quot; Millikin replied dryly.<br><br>&quot;Its settled then.  Meet me at the bank and make ready thirty-five platinum.&quot;  Esmalyn turned on a booted heel and left the stadium, quickly disappearing from sight as Millikin headed towards the bank muttering about avaricious money-grubbing Teir`Dal.<br><br>----------<br>Translations:<br><br>Vendui, elg' hasek.

As I told you before, they contain an elemental force's essence to imbue into another person, Wood elf.  Now stand aside unless you wish to become charred.&quot;  The rust colored dragon flicked his tail once for emphasis and Millikin stepped back as Sontalak drew a deep intake of breath and then quickly expelled a blast of lava into his hand holding the orbs and quickly closed it around them.  Millikin watched as a pale orange nimbus surrounded the dragon's claws.  <br><br>In moments Sontalak opened his hand to reveal a small flat crystalline disc bearing claw marks on the edges and the etchings of a fire dragon, wind dragon, water dragon, and an earth dragon on either side.  <br><br>  &quot;Simply break it to release its power into yourself.&quot;  Sontalak handed the disc to Millikin.<br><br>  &quot;Thank you.  But I was not going to use it myself.&quot;  Millikin replied as she took the offered disc.<br><br>  &quot;Then why have you spent the past few weeks pestering me about the orb you found a while ago and wheedling under rocks and ash through the mountains of Skyfire for the others more recently?&quot;  Sontalak craned his neck to face the ranger, bringing himself eye level to her, his look of consternation caused the ranger to freeze in place.<br><br>  &quot;It's for another.&quot;  Millikin stated uneasily when the dragon fear dissipated and she could think coherently enough to reply.  &quot;She's spent time going through books and scrolls in the Skyshrine and knows much of the Ring of Scale also.&quot;   Sontalak snorted at the mention of the Ring of Scale, an outcast sect of the Claws of Veeshan.  <br><br>  &quot;I thought she might like something akin to this.&quot;  Millikin paused.<br><br>  &quot;Then perhaps your friend should do the work to acquire it.&quot;  Sontalak rumbled once again.  The mental image brought a grin to Millikin's face though it quickly vanished.<br><br>  &quot;I doubt she would lower herself to foraging, even if she could.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Then why should she reap the benefits of your efforts, Ranger?&quot;<br><br>     Millikin paused to consider that question.  Indeed why was she even wasting her time?  Chances are the gift would be spurned outright.  Or worse, viewed as a bribe.  She quickly pushed aside that line of thought by deciding she would simply steel herself for the likely insults and deal with them when the time came.<br><br>  &quot;I suppose it is a means of requiting how I benefited from her efforts.&quot;   Millikin replied after a thoughtful pause.<br><br>  &quot;I see.&quot;  Sontalak replied.<br><br>  &quot;I'm not exactly adept with expressing my feelings.&quot;   The ranger explained.<br><br>  &quot;Actions speak for themselves, Ranger.&quot;  Sontalak remarked as he looked out into the wasteland ahead of them.  &quot;Are you going to continue with stories of your exploits with your shaman friend on the moon or do I wait until next time?&quot;  Another time she would recount to the aged dragon of her most recent sojourn into the Sshraeshza temple but for now, Millikin beamed as she began to recount to the dragon one of her and Saldaria's earlier forays into the Grey battling the Shissar and golems just outside the temple.<br><br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umillikinerreene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Millikin Erreene</A> at: 4/28/02 11:55:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umillikinerreene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Millikin Erreene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Arrowbringer </span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/27/02 9:53:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Curse</span><hr size=1> An Introspection by Millikin Erreene<br><br><br>     Millikin tended to take into consideration any personality criticisms made about her, even if she did not acknowledge them initially.  After some objective consideration of her behavior (if one taking into consideration their own traits can really be considered objective) and inquiries from those she did openly respect, the general consensus was that her somewhat somber outlook could be construed as such by those not familiar with the ranger's true nature.<br><br>     Why did she care what the luhtmauyar thought of her?  Thinking rationally, the ranger knew perfectly well that Valdayana D`Varr held no regard for anyone but herself so why should her opinion of anyone (which is guaranteed to be low) matter.  Millikin herself wasn't sure if she held some small hope that the enchanter was not irredeemably evil.  She remembered Ashwith's warning that she could just as likely help someone out for the sheer feeling of power over them and not because she held a modicum of regard for them.  Though the warning made sense, the concept was foreign to Millikin.  Whenever she traveled or explored with others, she felt a sense of responsibility for their safety and took what means she could to ensure that they did survive.  How anyone could not share that sense of obligation was inconceivable to the ranger.  Was that not the entire purpose of working together?<br><br>     Maybe Millikin respected the enchanter beyond the comprehension that she was extremely skilled in her field in spite of the enchanter's disparaging comments about her race, competence as a ranger, or personality.  Though how or why she had no clue.  Millikin hid the fact that sometimes Valdayana's comments bothered her by simply ignoring them or replying with a half-felt rejoinder of her own.  They technically shouldn't bother her because they were either said to simply provoke her or validly point out a fault.  And maybe the latter fact was what Millikin respected about her.  She didn't know for sure.<br><br>     Millikin stared down at the crystalline disc lying on the table.  It took quite a bit of effort on her part to obtain the crystals to make it, and convince the dragon known as Sontalak to do so as well.  The ranger was not sure how she would react to the insulting rebuff that was likely to result from her offering it to the enchanter and the thought of simply sending it by courier was very appealing.  At least she wouldn't see the rejection firsthand.  The thought of the gift becoming impersonal though made her ultimately dismiss the idea of having it delivered.  Millikin decided to offer it firsthand and simply brace herself for the worst as she picked up the disc and slid it into her pocket as she headed out of her flat. <p>M.

Desiring to keep her whereabouts and current activities obscured, she opted to travel under the guise of a half elven spice merchant named Raven Yadan.  The disguise not only prevented her from being beleaguered or attacked by the elves and dwarves who live on the continent, but it also served to mislead any potential rivals or enemies from ascertaining the reasons for her presence.  Forever pursuing knowledge, no matter how recondite or obscure, the enchanter's business in Faedwyr was recently concluded with the acquisition of a journal of some long forgotten thaumathurgy practices.<br><br>As the Sky Hawk went underway, the enchanter noticed a wood elf standing near the ship's railing, readying a corded arrow into the short bow she held as she looked down at the waters.  <br><br>  'Trust a wood elf to find a way to complicate something as simple-minded as fishing.'  The half elf watched as she fired the arrow into the water.  As it streaked downward, the cord unfurled to reveal it was tied to the railing and soon the ranger started to pull the cord up and reveal her catch.  A codfish was impaled upon the arrow.<br><br>  &quot;You know, fishing is infinitely easier if you use a fishing pole and bait.&quot;  The half elf remarked as the ranger extracted her arrow and tossed her catch into a nearby basket.<br><br>  &quot;Yes, but I don't have either with me right now.  And this is an alternative.&quot;  The wood elf turned to the speaker and instantly the incognito enchanter recognized her.<br><br>  &quot;Ranger.&quot;  The half elf spoke half question, half statement.  The Feir` Dal nodded in affirmation and turned to get a better look at the individual.  The silver haired half elf was nearly six feet tall, steel grey eyes were hidden behind a pair of gold wire-rimmed spectacles.  And despite the fact that she was dressed in a silk wayfarer's chemise and loose fitting trousers, her mannerisms seemed to indicate to the ranger that the half elf was less at home aboard a ship than a mansion in some large city.<br><br>  &quot;Millikin Erreene.&quot;  The ranger set aside her bow and extended her hand in greeting.  For her own part, the half elf adjusted the spectacles she was wearing and glanced at the offered hand with a measured pause before taking the hand in greeting -- just long enough to be polite.<br><br>  &quot;Raven Yadan.&quot;  She responded, smiling faintly to the ranger, wiping her hand on a handkerchief she had removed from a pocket.  <br><br>  &quot;A pleasure.&quot;  Millikin turned to pick up her bow, hiding a faint smile at the display of snobbery.  &quot;Did you lose your book or something?&quot;  She readied another arrow.<br><br>  &quot;Excuse me?&quot;  Raven asked in a quizzical tone.  'How could she know about the journal?'  Instantly she studied Millikin in mild suspicion, masked as curiosity.<br><br>  &quot;The reading spectacles.&quot;   The ranger indicated with a slight gesture.  Something caught Raven's attention as Millikin turned back to the water.  The medicine pouch worn around the ranger's neck possessed an eldritch power that called to the enchanter.  This was not one of the myriad druidic talismans rangers and others of her ilk typically carried.<br><br>  &quot;The spectacles.  No.&quot;  Raven responded.  &quot;They simply help me to see better.  What is that you're wearing around your neck?  I've never seen that before.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;It's a medicine pouch.  It's used to hold spell components and similar objects.&quot;  Millikin replied, studying the water.<br><br>  &quot;Is that what yours possesses?&quot;  Raven's question seemed innocuous enough, but something about it gave Millikin pause.  'Why would it suddenly be of interest to someone who barely deigned to shake hands earlier?'<br><br>  &quot;No.  It carries an object I intend to give to someone else.&quot;  <br><br>  &quot;What sort of object?&quot;  <br><br>  &quot;Something I obtained a while ago.&quot;  Millikin fired another arrow, this time intentionally missing her target.  No other information was forthcoming.<br><br>  &quot;Better luck next time, I suppose.&quot;  Raven remarked, smiling faintly to her once again.<br><br>  &quot;Perhaps.&quot;  Millikin retrieved the arrow then tucked the pouch underneath her tunic before resuming her bow fishing.<br><br>  &quot;Good day to you then, Millikin Erreene.&quot;  Raven turned to leave, knowing she may have better luck with the ranger at a later time.<br><br>  &quot;Good afternoon, Ms. Yadan.&quot;  Millikin replied, watching the half elf depart from the corner of her eye.

Above her loomed the guilds of the magical arts, her own designation included amongst them, and every so often she could hear the workings of different defensive spells coming from above.  Her momentary solitude was dedicated to toying with a pouch of runes, identifying each of the marks upon them to further her research for greater spells.  Quasqueton had promised her even greater runes when he returned back from his quest, but the days seemed to grow longer and longer in his absence.  It was in this moment of study and reflection that she distinctly heard the soft footfalls of the sure-footed ranger approaching her.<br><br>A smile crept across the delicately defined high Elven face as she let the initial shock of the visit wear away, and Shio rose to her feet.  She stood taller than the ranger, though her frame more willowy, and her hair was quite obviously flame kissed by her deity of the arts, Solusek Ro, whom she called upon for the power of her spells.  She reached out her hands to the ranger as she spoke softly in the language of the elves "Creoso eska, tinu en'Tunare.  It is good to see you home cousin."  Millikin gripped her hands in return though her present mood was unreadable, as often it was, by her kin.  "Diol'lle, Shiobahn.  It is good to return once again."<br><br>Shiobahn studied her a moment, certain there was a tale to be told, but not knowing when the ranger would tell it, if she decided to speak of it at all.  "We shall catch up over a glass of Elven wine.  The day is still early and the tavern is open across town.  Just allow me to pack my things."  Shio did not offer much room for argument, though then she rarely did.  She quickly bent down to retrieve her runes, pouring them back into a small pouch that hung from her belt.  She carried a small myriad of trinkets this way, including a finely crafted golden bowl bearing a few small dings in the bottom which hinted at the fact she was not afraid to swing it at something if one of her spells was going awry, no matter how futile the attempt was.  Tucking her blanket into a backpack she then set off on foot along side her cousin to the tavern.<br><br>........................<br>Felwith - Northern District<br><br>A glass of Elven wine and a treat of a small fruit tart later the two sat together in an out of the way corner of the bar.  It was an enjoyable time filled with tales of adventure, many of Millikin's taking place in the frozen lands of Velious which intrigued Shio and much of Shio's having taken place another great distance away, in the newly explored moon of Luclin.  It was Millikin's comments of the wastelands in the far west reaches of the frozen continent that perked Shio's attention.  "Cousin, why have you come home from such great adventures?  And have you heard word of a Quasqueton?  He has been in those far reaching lands for some time up to now under quest of the Coldain.  I know he is allied to the dragon beasts that survive out there, but he has not sent word recently and I worry.  The last I knew he had enlisted the aid of the Troubadour Autumnwyld, but it is still a harsh land for wizard and bard alone."<br><br>She quickly saw the look of recognition in Millikin's eyes as she uttered the names, and a look of hope appeared upon her face.  She felt the matter bore further explanation and she quickly added in "Quas and I were bound together just this spring in a quiet ceremony under Ro's watchful eye.  It is a difficult balance some days, love and magic.  We did not make a spectacle of our union, I am sorry to have not informed you but it is nearly impossible to track the tracker." <br><br>...............................<br><br>Creoso eska, tinu en'Tunare  - Welcome home daughter of Tunare<br>Diol'lle, Shiobahn - Thank you, Shiobahn<br><br>Shiobahn Fyrestrike is the sole property of her creator and used only for role playing purposes.

Had she heard of Quasqueton? Of course she had. Her thoughts momentarily turned to her initial meeting with him. Autumn had invited her to venture into Charasis, the Howling Stones with some of her recent adventuring companions. The purpose of the foray into the tomb of the late Drusilla Sathir was for archaeological reasons: Quasqueton wished to complete a set of Kylong armor and had spent considerable time gathering up the different pieces of armor once worn by the Iksar tribe.<br><br>He had seemed a bit unconventional, to say the least. Instead of wielding magic with the calculating efficiency of Valdayana D`Varr or passionate devotion of Saldaria Snowspirit, Quasqueton blithely hurled lightning or fire at the walking dead or golem sentries that protected the place as if he were playing a game of catch. Eventually they obtained the final piece of armor for his collection, a chainmail tunic. Millikin had been surprised that the enchantment placed on by its iksar creators granting the wearer enhanced strength had remained in tact despite the onslaught of magic and melee required to destroy the iksar skeletal remains that had been wearing it.<br><br>She had met him subsequently a few more times, once in the Umbral Plains, but more commonly in Velious. During a Coldain assault on the Ry`Gorr fort, a gem mining expedition in the Siren's Grotto, and once while exploring the Dragon Necropolis. Millikin snapped out of her mental reverie as Shiobahn explained that they had been married recently.<br><br>&quot;Yes, I do know him. I've met him and adventured with him, the last time was while in Velious.&quot; Millikin rubbed the back of her neck, idly wondering how such a detail could have been forgotten to have been mentioned by her parents or her sister in their correspondence. Then it occurred to her that even they may not know. Acting on spontaneous impulse was a common trait, particularly in the Goldbrooke family and Millikin could not honestly say she always acted only after careful deliberation.<br><br>Nor could she exactly sum up her feelings on hearing the news except that she somehow expected it to come back and haunt her. Somehow. Millikin reached for the black medicine pouch she was wearing around her neck to make sure it was still there as she downed the last of her wine then took a deep breath, hoping her offer wouldn't turn out to be more than she bargained for.<br><br>&quot;It appears my list of errands for arcanists is expanding.

She still had a few pieces of parchment left over from her last endeavors and certainly enough of everything else she needed.  The barkeep looked at Shiobahn with a raised brow as she was intent to spread her things across his freshly polished bar top, yet she opted not to notice his less than amused expression.<br><br>  "Thank you Millikin, this means a great deal to me."<br><br>  She focused on her note while her cousin finished off her drink, her writing in an elegant Koada`Dal script.  A hundred questions and thoughts came to mind, but for the sake of her cousin she attempted to be brief.  She enclosed a tiny packet of mistletoe to the finished note, and she folded it with great care not to damage the leaves.  She caught Millikin's curious glance to the not so often used component and Shio simply smiled.<br><br>  "I do not ask cousin, I simply gathered this upon his request.  He was ranting about cabbage at the time."<br><br>  She pressed the letter into the bewildered Ranger's hands.  It was impossible to explain to Millikin how such a strange pair came to be.  She then let out a small sigh, as she longed to explore the depths of the wastes herself.  She did not know how far she could push Millikin's gestures of kindness though, as she was certain she already was on a mission.  Testing the waters she asked with some uncertainty.<br><br>  "Cousin, do you think you could lead me as far as Iceclad if you are headed that way?  I would like to try and meet up with Quas in the Dwarven City and I included in my note I would try to get there.

If you are going to wander in that region beware of the Ry`Gorr orcs and Kromrif giants. The orcs and giants have an alliance and are at war against the Coldain. The dwarves actually built their city in a mountainside and is hidden behind a waterfall to prevent invasion by the frost giants.&quot; The ranger reached for an unused piece of parchment and quill, and drew a rough map as she explained how to access the city.<br><br>~~~<br><br>The Dragon Portal of the Great Divide.<br><br>A tear in the fabric of time and space opened up and allowed the Feir`Dal ranger, the Koada`Dal wizard, and half elven druid to appear within the obsidian ring. Millikin habitually turned and looked up at the statue of the dragon guardian. After an exchange of coin and word of thanks, the druid traced a rectangular pattern in midair and vanished in a swirl of mist. <br><br>The biting chill wind was the first thing to grab Shiobahn's attention as she examined the landscape. For as far as the eye could see was snow, looming black cliffsides or mountain peaks. She pulled her cloak closer around her form and followed Millikin's direction in the south.<br><br>&quot;The mad sorceror Velketor makes his lair in one of the caves that way. The Coldain say he sometimes kidnaps their people for experiments and even his own people, the Kromzek spurn him. I've explored the caves a bit. He has golem constructs and gargoyles guarding the entrances to his castle. Mostly I've encountered giant spiders or kobolds there though. There's also whispers of a dissident sect of Coldain making a hideout in the caves out here. I've not had the chance to confirm that as of yet though.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It sounds as if you've gotten involved in the politics of the Coldain, Cousin. Despite your experiences in Freeport.&quot; Shiobahn smiled to the ranger.<br><br>Millikin shrugged slightly. &quot;They are at war with the those who encroach upon the Tunarean Court. 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' I suppose you could say. And Thurgadin, our destination, is due north. Barring any accidents or delays, we should reach the city in an hour or so. It gets cold out here at night.&quot;<br><br>As the two headed north, the ranger continued her discourse of the local inhabitants and creatures of the area and how to best combat or avoid them. Shardwurms roamed near the mountain peaks near their lairs within and seemed to blend into the background with their white scales. Until they unleashed their chilling breath weapon. The primitive yaklike humanoid tizmak made their home in a network of caves in the western mountain sides. Feral kodiaks wandered the eastern and southern mountain range. Finally Shiobahn saw the outline of a Coldain guard tower near a river and faintly heard the roar of a waterfall. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a shadowy outline rushing towards them...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umillikinerreene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Millikin Erreene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Arrowbringer </span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/1/02 3:09:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Curse</span><hr size=1> Trip to Third Gate (Another Interlude)<br><br>  &quot;Milli, I kind of need your help with something.&quot;  The half elven rogue known to most as Corvariel Nytewisp ran his fingers through his hair and smiled his most charming smile to the Feir`Dal ranger who was perched on the roof of the Hidden Inn in East Commonlands.<br><br>  &quot;With what?&quot;  Millikin called from her vantage point.  She noticed two orcs carrying a wooden crate from one of their encampments.  The sight had apparently become a commonplace occurrence lately from Clan Deathfist and she had decided to find out what was going on.<br><br>  &quot;You remember that wonderful spear you gave me awhile back.  From Luclin?&quot;  <br><br>  &quot;Mmm hmm.&quot;  Millikin replied, her attention had focused on the Freeport Militia guard that was patrolling nearby.  One of the orcs approached him.  Though too far away to hear, Millikin was perceptive enough to realize that a conversation of some sort was taking place.  Then suddenly the guard drew his sword and ran the orc through.  This was not totally unexpected but the fact that the guard had even entertained a parley with the Deathfist was what piqued the ranger's curiosity.<br><br>  &quot;Well, I lost it.&quot;  Corvariel paused for dramatic effect before continuing.  &quot;Somewhere in Neriak.&quot;  He leaned against the wall and waited.  Millikin froze at the last statement then jumped from the roof in front of Corvariel.<br><br>  &quot;What in the Nine Hells were you doing in Neriak.&quot;  <br><br>Truth be told he was attempting to pilfer from one of the guildmasters, but he wasn't about to tell Millikin that.  He knew she took a dim view of stealing as a rule.  He smiled once again.<br><br>  &quot;I was uhm -- sightseeing.  Yes.  I'd never been to Neriak before and thought since I was passing by I may as well go ahead and check it out.  Anyway, I was minding my own business but apparently a few of the dark elves didn't much care for my dropping in unannounced.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Uh huh.&quot;  Millikin looked straight at him.  If that wasn't the wateriest lie she'd ever heard in her life, it certainly ranked up in the top five.  Nonetheless Corvariel smiled again at her as if to say 'That's my story and I'm sticking with it.'<br><br>  &quot;Where about did you lose it?&quot;  Millikin sighed, foreseeing a trip to Neriak in her immediate future.<br><br>  &quot;I believe the sign said Third Gate.&quot;  Corvariel stated innocently.  Millikin stared at him.  While she was not familiar with the city firsthand, it was a well known fact that the Third Gate was the heart of Neriak where the rich and powerful lived.  And that included their clergy and practitioners of the dark arts.<br><br>  &quot;Just sightseeing, huh?&quot;  A touch of sarcasm laced Millikin's remark.  &quot;So tell me, did this tour entail visiting the palace of their queen?&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Oh nothing so grandiose.  Just their training hall for rogues.  Of course I couldn't pass by and not look in.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Of course not.&quot;  Millikin remarked caustically as the two headed towards the tunnel that led to Nektulos Forest.<br><br>~~~~~<br><br>Making it past the city gate sentries was not overly difficult for either the ranger or rogue but moving silently and unnoticed through an entire city without the use of magic was more difficult.<br><br>  &quot;You could probably use your invisibility spell here -- &quot;<br><br>  &quot;Camouflage.&quot;  Millikin interrupted.  &quot;Spellcasters use invisibility.  Rangers and druids use camouflage.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot;  Corvariel dismissed the remark.  &quot;As I was saying, it may not be a good idea to cast spells deeper in the city.  They have a lot of spellcasters that might pick up on it.  I just need you to get rid of anyone that might see us.  Maybe toss their bodies in the water or whatever.&quot;<br><br>Corvariel moved towards the stone bridge that sloped down and led into a checkpoint tower.  Millikin grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled him back to whisper (somewhat loudly) in his ear.  <br><br>  &quot;You know, it is activities of that sort which invite retaliation.  While you may not care overmuch, I'd prefer that Kelethin and Felwithe not turn into a site for assassination games.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;If they see you they'll kill you.&quot;  Corvariel added.<br><br>  &quot;Then I'll deal with them then.  But this is their home and we're asking for trouble by coming here.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Yaa, fine then.  When you get past the checkpoint go right and make a sharp turn left.  Before you get to the fountain, turn right and head down that passage and stop at the pool.  I'll meet you there.  Don't go much further as there's a guardhouse nearby and the city commons area has a series of portcullis gates to deter intruders and invaders.  The guards control the opening and shutting of those gates.&quot;<br><br>Millikin nodded at the directions and sprinted down the slope and past the check point.  The guards standing at either side either took no notice of her or saw the eldritch lightning coursing through the sword blades in either hand and instantly decided that they would not interfere unless a general alarm was sounded.  Millikin paused at the water fountain just before she could resume in the direction Corvariel had outlined previously, a single guard had come around the corner from one of the shops further down the path.<br><br>  &quot;You there.  Stop!&quot;  <br><br>Millikin paid no heed to the demand to halt and continued along the twisted passageways until she stood at a ledge that overlooked a pool of water.  As she walked down the incline towards the tunnel mouth on the opposite side of the pool, Corvariel waved from the tunnel and began talking quietly.<br><br>  &quot;The guardhouse is up ahead.  There's two you'll see at the far end and two offices at the other end of the main portcullis gate.  One or two guards are in either tower.  But there's two towers across from then that you can't see because they'll be behind us as we approach.  There's usually a guard or two inside those as well.  Once you're past the main portcullis and in the courtyard there are smaller once to either the left or right.  We want to head left this time.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Ten guards?&quot;  Millikin inquired.<br><br>  &quot;Uh ... eleven actually.&quot;  I forgot.  There is one who wanders.  He patrols the outskirts of the commons areas and he'll come up close to here then turn back and continue his circuit.  They raise and lower the portcullis for him.  He's the captain of the watchguard or whatever.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Are you sure you know what you're talking about?  Capt. N`Farre is the captain of the guard and he was outside at the gate earlier.&quot;  Millikin looked at Corvariel and her eyes narrowed slightly.<br><br>  &quot;The guard's nobody with any kind of rank really.  He's just in charge over here.  See, here he comes now.&quot;  Millikin heard the clinking of chains and looked up as Corvariel pointed as a dark elf guard in red trimmed silver armor headed their way.  The visor of his helm was pulled down as he strode purposely towards them.  Elf and half-elf alike stepped back into the shadows of the tunnel and suddenly the Teir`Dal did a sharp about-face and marched in the other direction.<br><br>  &quot;We need to move now while the portcullis is up.&quot;  Corvariel suddenly took off running before Millikin could say another word.  Millikin quickened her pace when suddenly the guard they had seen earlier turned around suddenly.<br><br>  &quot;Intruder!&quot;  In a blur of motion the dark elf drew his sword and sliced an overhead arc for Millikin's head.  A guard looked out from the tower and moved towards her.  The ranger brought her left sword, Earthcaller, up to block the swing and twisted her wrist as if to hilt punch the guard with Swiftwind, and the last moment, she snapped the edge of her blade towards his neck and pulled back, slashing his neck.  The Teir`Dal body's stiffened and his sword clattered to the ground as he fell.<br><br>One of the guards called out as two of them advanced on the ranger.<br><br>  &quot;You're that filthy Tunarean ranger&quot;  The guard who had spoken smashed his shield towards her face and caused her to stagger back a step while the other moved to try and flank her.<br><br>  &quot;I'm not filthy.&quot;  The guard suddenly slumped over as one of Corvariel's throwing knives found itself imbedded between his ribs.  He was standing on the other side of the portcullis.<br><br>  &quot;Stop playing around, Milli.&quot;  She didn't notice the two corpses slumped against the wall.  One had his throat slit and the other had a sliver of metal shoved right under his fifth rib<br><br>  &quot;Close the gates!&quot;  One of the guards had the presence of mind to call out and the rattling of chains was heard.<br><br>  &quot;Much as I'd love to stay for a dance or two...&quot; Millikin ducked a swing aimed for her head by her flanking guard and spun sideways to avoid a sword thrust aimed for her heart by a guard who had arrived at the alarm call.  &quot;I must be off.  Another night perhaps.&quot;  The ranger ran towards the lowering gates and dove for the ground, sliding just beyond the portcullis as it slammed into place.  She quickly stood up and dusted herself off, spitting dirt out of her mouth in the process.<br>  <br>  &quot;I wonder if this is what they mean by the saying everyone eats a pinch of dirt sometime in their life.&quot;  Corvariel smirked at her.<br><br>  &quot;You may find yourself under six feet of dirt sooner than later.  Particularly once they get that portcullis back up.&quot;  Both heard the tell-tale creaking of chains to indicate it was being raised.<br><br>  &quot;Right.  Lets go.&quot;<br><br>The two ran down streets and alleyways of the commons section of Neriak and into the section called Third Gate.  A general alarm had been sounded and Neriak's guards were marching through the streets searching for them.  The two ducked into an abandoned building for a few hours until the ruckus about their presence died down.  Sitting down crosslegged behind some crates Millikin closed her eyes, while Corvariel paced near a window, peeking out occasionally.<br><br>  &quot;You just had to be seen didn't you.&quot;  Corvariel whispered.<br><br>  &quot;Not intentionally.  Besides, it was your idea to rush the gate, not mine.  And you're the reason I'm here in the first place.&quot;  Millikin responded complacently.  As had become habit, she reached up to make sure her medicine pouch was still around her neck, then stood up.<br><br>  &quot;Yeah yeah.&quot;  Corvariel grumbled.  &quot;Anyhow, when we get to the training hall.  Just invis us and...<br><br>  &quot;Camouflage.&quot;  Millikin corrected.<br><br>  &quot;Whatever ... and I'll poke around until I find my spear.  You wait outside the hall.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;If you get caught stealing or something I am NOT going to help you.&quot;  Millikin looked at him dubiously.  <br><br>  &quot;Me?  Steal?  I'm hurt you'd make such an accusation of me.  I just want to get my spear back.&quot;<br><br>The two made their way towards the thieves guild.  And once the cantra was recited to render them invisible, Corvariel skipped up the steps unseen.  For her part, Millikin paced back and forth outside, stopping only once to inspect the statues in the front of the guildhall, with mild distaste.<br><br>  &quot;Run!&quot;  Suddenly Millikin caught sight of Corvariel tearing out of the hall, his spear gripped in his hand.  Two dark elves were not far behind, weapons drawn.  She whispered another druidic cantra and one of the dark elves slowed his step.  He turned towards her cursing but she quickly ran after Corvariel.  She readied her bow and nocked an arrow, taking careless aim at his other pursuer.  The first shot missed but the second arrow hit him in the leg.  She lost sight of the rogue after the second shot and ducked down another alleyway.  Millikin was not surprised to see him near the city entrance gates on her way out.<br><br>  &quot;I got what I came for.&quot;  He grinned at her, spear in hand.<br><br>  &quot;I bet you did.&quot;  She looked at him suspiciously.<br><br>  &quot;What?&quot;  Corvariel took a tone of feigned slight.  &quot;Here I was going to thank you and all and you accuse me of having an ulterior motive.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;I haven't accused you of anything yet.&quot;  Millikin looked at him.<br><br>  &quot;Well, nonetheless, thank you anyway.  It means a lot to me.&quot;  Corvariel added deciding it best not press the issue to raise the ranger's suspicions right away.<br><br>  &quot;You're welcome.  I think.  Until, later, Corv.&quot;  That said, the ranger transformed into a dark furred wolf and ran into the Nektulos Forest.<br><br>~~~~~<br><br>Corvariel Nytewisp is the sole property of his creator and used only for role playing purposes, with prior consent.

A silvery mist outlined the doors and windows of the room, preventing them from being casually opened by anyone, save the spellcaster.  <br><br>  &quot;Good bye, Raven.&quot;  The enchanter discarded the trappings she wore to detail her disguise as her facial features became more angular and her ear tips more pointed.  Her skin darkened as the enchanter reverted to her natural form.  She set the spectacles on the table before her and sat down in an elaborately carved chair.  If the enchanter was inclined to gloat over her accomplishments, (Which is not to say she doesn't.) she would have reflected over how swiftly she learned of this journal's existence and how she legitimately obtained it.  <br><br>The one eyed old human with two raven pets struck her as somewhat senile at first when she overheard him discussing an enchanter's journal one evening with another companion.  Nonetheless she listened, both in amusement and in the hopes that perhaps he may know something else of value.  Then he mentioned that the book was all but forgotten in the library of a sage in Felwithe who died recently.  The man had a half-brained scheme to steal the book but wasn't sure he could pull it off.  An idea quickly took shape in the enchanter's mind and she parted company.  It did not take her long to verify that the claims of a sage's death were indeed true.  The enchanter quickly created a persona and chose the name in homage of the two preternaturally intelligent birds and mockery of their owner.  She concocted a story about the journal belonging to a deceased relative who knew the sage when he was younger.  The sage's family was content to let her take the journal, thinking it little more than the personal diary of a human spellcaster.<br><br>As it was though, the enchanter gave no further thought to the old man or his birds, only to what content of a forgotten book in Felwithe's archives could possibly be of interest to him.  She opened the journal and began to read...<br><br>Hours later, she closed the book.  The implications in the journal were unexpected to be sure and if they proved to be true, the power she stood to gain would be remarkable.  Some of the spell research was incomplete or experiments were flawed but the former would be corrected with some modifications to the latter.  The only thing the enchanter needed was a suitable test subject.  Someone who's existence was inconsequential to her long term plans and meaningless to the people she currently threw in her lot with as she did not want to risk alienating them for the time being.  She opened the journal again to reread the requirements of the spell, already someone in mind, she began mentally formulating her experiment procedure. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uautumncrescendo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Autumn Crescendo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Auty the Primadonna</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/14/02 3:16:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Curse</span><hr size=1> Great Divide - <br><br>  Despite the enchantment of a magical skin Shiobahn was slapped to the side by a large paw that nearly encompassed half of her torso.  The second slap hit her and again though unscathed by her shielding it did not stop her from getting a bit dazed.  It would break through in a few more hits, but what was it.  Pulling herself up from the deep snow that bogged the pass, her eyes lifted to face her assailant, and she was face to face with the Kodiak.  Its eyes gleamed with raw fury, and its claws were in full extension from its paws, and again it tried mauling and maiming in large swinging strokes, a third and fourth glancing off her shield.  <br><br>  Millikin was swift on the scene; she knew this type of combat was not one her cousin would last in.  Shiobahn was uttering the words to shackle the beast while dodging blows, and just as the spell took off Millikin was in control.  Energy crackled from the duel blades she wielded and she went into a fast and furious combat, the beast scarcely landing a solid hit on the nimble elf.  Shiobahn regained her composure as swiftly as she could, reaching her arms out as she called upon the power of the elements and invoked them into a fiery rain pelting down upon the Kodiak in waves.  Before she could even utter another spell though the beast was run through and crumpled to the ground.<br><br>  Millikin gave a quick assessment of her cousin, assuring that there was nothing more than minor damage to be had.  Her eyes scanned down either side of the pass before falling more particularly on the snow.  Her tracking skills were keen and she wanted to make certain that their attacker had been alone.  Satisfied he was simply a wanderer she glanced back at her cousin.  <br><br>"Perhaps you will want to use a shield of invisibility until we are safely at the city lines."<br><br>Shiobahn nodded in agreement, glanced around a moment with some trepidation, then withdrew her spell book flipping with haste to the area she had her invisibility spell marked.  It took but a second to refresh the incantation to her mind before she felt certain enough to cast it.  Her fingers traced a series of runes in the air and in a moment she was cloaked in the stealth of invisibility.  <br><br>"I am ready."  Shiobahn murmured to her cousin.<br><br>"This way then."  Millikin gave a small tilt of her head to indicate direction before again into the snow.<br><br>  Shiobahn marveled at how many people she saw in a mimicked fashion, skirting in the shadows of invisibility with her.  She touched the slim bone hoop earring Quasqueton had brought her as a gift from his travels, the enchantment allowing her the sight to spot those hiding in the folds of invisibility.  It was good to know she was not so alone as she lurked in the cold wastes.  The frozen stream caught her attention ahead.  The water was crisp and an icy blue, and the sounds of the waterfall that kept it moving came into hearing distance.  Curving around the river they ended up at the base of the falls and Millikin turned to regard her cousin.<br><br>"Follow me around back, we will go behind the falls."  She called out over the heavy rush of water.<br><br>"Behind?  This is what you spoke of when you mentioned their protection from the Giants, yes?"<br><br>  Millikin nodded then slipped behind the falls, and passing by the guards that held the outposts at the front of the city.  Shiobahn scampered behind the waterfall as well and blinked coming into site of the Dwarves.  She was raised not so far from the city of Kaladim, and these Dwarves looked nothing like the ones of her homelands.  Their skin was so pale it was near transparent coming from years of never seeing the sun.  Their features were harsher, and more chiseled, almost a reflection of the world that surrounded them.  It was after a series of gates that the two parted ways.  A brief discussion on where the basic essentials could be found took place.<br><br>"Be safe cousin, and good luck finding Quas"  Shiobahn gave the ranger a quick embrace.<br><br>"Thank you."  Millikin murmured, taken aback by the affection of her cousin.  "I should not have too much trouble finding him, he leaves a trail of disaster in his wake."<br><br>"I know, isn't it fantastic?"  Shiobahn beamed.<br><br>"I will never understand wizards"  Millikin muttered as she walked off in search of a few fletching supplies for the road.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umillikinerreene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Millikin Erreene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Arrowbringer </span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/17/02 1:10:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Curse</span><hr size=1> Millikin exited Thurgadin, Shiobahn's letter was safely stowed in her backpack.  By nightfall she had reached the Eastern Wastes and the temperature was dropping rapidly.  Millikin looked at the rapidly darkening sky, a storm was approaching.  She smiled grimly to herself as she made her way to a Coldain shelter she knew was nearby.  An explosion and flash of orange light caught her attention.  The aroma of burning flesh and charred fur assailed her sense of smell and made her eyes water.<br><br>The ranger quickly headed in that direction.  On occasion she saw the corpses of tundra kodiaks, dire wolves, orc scouts, even a snow griffin.  She sighed inwardly as she knelt down and inspected the snow for tracks.  None were visible, which means the perpetrator was most likely a spellcaster.  Why didn't people make use of the remains?  Corpses tended to attract scavengers.  Soon the snow was falling faster and the wind grew louder so that she almost didn't hear the approaching Kromrif.<br><br>  &quot;Die Outlander!&quot;  The sight of forged velium flashed before her and ripped through the chain mesh tunic she wore, spilling blood on the white snow in front of her.  The ranger fell backwards and immediately rolled sideways to avoid the follow-up strike.  In moments she was on her feet, weapons drawn, a healing cantra passed her lips and the wounds immediately began to close.  Millikin circled behind the Kromrif as he turned with a slashing arc towards her.  In a blur of motion, she ran between his legs and slashed at the back of his knees.  The giant howled in fury and lashed out with his fist to connect with a solid crunch to her back as she ran in front of him.  The ranger stumbled a few paces and spun around in time to block his weapon thrust and counterblow to his elbow with Swiftwind.  The giant was wielding a dagger, but the blade was long enough to be considered a short sword by the elf's estimation.  The Kromrif scout swung his foot sideways to sweep the elf to the ground and was mildly surprised to see she only staggered slightly.  <br><br>  &quot;By Rallos, you are more resilient than I expected, Outlander.  Mayhap there is a place for you alive as a servant.&quot;  The giant bantered as he saw the outline of the ranger backing away, he could hear her breath was ragged and grinned thinking this encounter would be over all too soon.<br><br>  &quot;I've no intention of finding out.&quot;  Swords still in hand, the elven ranger traced a sigil in midair.  Magical energy coalesced briefly then flickered out.  Somehow she had miscast the spell.  &quot;Valdayana's thrice damned curse.&quot;  She sighed again.  Swiftly wiping her blades and sheathing them, Millikin turned and ran relying on the darkness from the approaching storm for cover.  The giant quickly followed, though his vision was not as good as the elf's.  The protective enchantment the ranger had enabling her to regenerate from injuries at an accelerated rate without calling upon a healing cantra would fade soon.  She quickly pulled herself up into the branches of a tree and readied her bow.  Soon she saw the Kromrif's outline and took aim.  The arrow tore through the giant's chest and he staggered.  He reached for the piece of wood and ripped it out, cursing.  The arrowhead was barbed.  Another arrow found itself imbedded in his shoulder and a third grazed his temple.  Hastily the giant turned and ran.  Millikin watched his departure as she dropped down from the tree more intent on finding cover from the approaching storm than giving chase.  She smelled smoke from a nearby campfire, and unless she was hopelessly lost she was fairly sure that Garadain Glacierbane's encampment wasn't too far away.  She headed in that direction.<br><br>~~~~~<br><br>The Kromrif scout grumbled as he made his way back to Kael Drakkel, limping and bleeding.  Far too many outlanders of late have been seen in the area and working with the Coldain.  And the fact that he had been bested by one would not be viewed favorably by Sergeant Tellsren.<br><br>  &quot;Kromrif.  I want a few words with you.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Eh?&quot;  The giant turned around and looked down to see a small framed creature hidden beneath a hooded travel cloak and his brow furrowed.  Another outlander.  The person was armed with a stave of some sort, he couldn't quite make out the details.  His first thought was to step on the person and move on, hoping this one's death would salvage his reputation somewhat after his defeat at the hands of the Feir`Dal.<br><br>  &quot;The ranger you fought earlier.  Her blood is still on your weapon, no?&quot;  <br><br>The giant glanced down at the dagger in his hand.  The blood was slowly drying on the velium blade.<br><br>  &quot;Yes.  What of it?&quot;  The giant rumbled, tightening the grip on the hilt in anticipation of challenge.<br><br>  &quot;I require that elf's blood.&quot;  The speaker spoke quietly.<br><br>  &quot;Then get it from her yourself, Outlander.&quot;  The Kromrif sneered.<br><br>  &quot;I do not have the time for such menial activities.&quot;  <br><br>  &quot;You mean you lack the ability to get it from her.

The freezing winds were biting and there were not many architectural structures or arboreal features to serve as a windbreak out in the Western Wastes.  Millikin whispered a few words and her features contorted as shaggy cinnamon colored fur grew from her body.  Her teeth elongated and were noticeably sharper as she dropped down to all fours, the transformation into a dire wolf complete.  She sniffed the tracks she had found in the snow and after detecting the same scent on the wind she ran off in the direction of one of Veeshan's Scars.<br><br><br>  &quot;I hate this place.&quot;  Autumnwyld Crescendo repeated for the umpteenth time.  She had spent the past few days tracking and killing the savage velium hounds for their furs.  They had proven to be annoyingly difficult to find.  Adding to her aggravation was the fact that rangers and druids, with their superior understanding of animal behavior and habitats, were often able to locate the dens, hunting territories, and watering holes of these creatures and dispatch them, ofttimes before she could even find one in her vicinity.  The Coldain's ruler, Dain Colin Frostreaver IV had commissioned the creation of fine armor for the Coldain army and anyone capable of meeting the specifications was rewarded handsomely for their efforts.  Quasqueton Fyrestrike was confident he was one of those people and had spent the past few weeks gathering the materials he needed, preparing the parts of the armor short of formally forging the pieces as time and equipment permitted.  Obsessively lost in his work, he was not paying any attention to the bard, then he jabbed his hand with his leather puncher and cursed profusely.  Autumn snickered.<br><br>  &quot;The length of time it takes me to complete this padding impacts how long we stay here.  Hopefully this will be enough.  But if I ruin a pelt I'll need to replace it.&quot;  The silver haired wizard pointed to the silvery white furs stacked near a plethora of tailoring and leatherworking tools scattered around.  &quot;So we can't leave yet.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Alright, alright.&quot;  Autumn sighed and looked around.  She saw a small outline in the distance.  Even after donning the mask to take the appearance of a dark elf with their superior ultravision, she couldn't quite make out the form but it looked like another velium hound on the prowl.  She readied her sword, once more Quasqueton was engrossed in his work and didn't seem to notice her actions.  Singing the song of Selo's, Autumn broke into a run and headed off in that direction.  After following a somewhat circular path, Autumn realized the hound was heading deliberately for Quasqueton, not in the stalker's pace though.  Slowing down, she figured it was likely someone intent on requesting that the wizard transport them somewhere out of this barren wasteland.<br><br>Millikin saw the wizard some distance away and trotted closer.  She quickly noticed that he was leatherworking and waited silently for several moments.  Feeling he was being watched, Quasqueton looked up to see a dire wolf staring at him.  He quickly jumped to his feet and whispered an incantation.  Motes of flame erupted from his fingertips, when he realized the wolf had not attacked and he closed his hand into a fist to quickly dissipate the fiery energy he was gathering in anticipation of an attack.  He studied it closer.  Druids that were capable of surviving out in the Western Wastes usually opted to travel in the guise of a small jet black wolf.  This one was larger and brown.  <br><br>  &quot;May I help you, Ranger?&quot;  Quasqueton queried after a moment.<br><br>  &quot;I have a message for you.  From...&quot;  Millikin paused, still considering the irony.  &quot;your wife.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Shio?  What did she possibly say to persuade you to track me all the way out here?&quot;<br><br>  &quot;She is a kinsman of mine.&quot;  Millikin mentally willed the transformation back into her elven form and reached into her backpack searching for the letter.  &quot;And for most intents and purposes, now so are you.&quot;  She handed him Shiobahn's note as Autumn came up from behind her, still wearing her dark elven disguise.<br><br>  &quot;A family reunion?&quot;  Autumn laughed.  Millikin turned around<br>  <br>  &quot;You're still wearing that damned dark elf disguise?&quot;  <br><br>  &quot;Oh hush up, Ranger.  You'd be surprised at how well I can see when using it.&quot;  Autumn quipped.<br><br>  &quot;Why hadn't she mentioned it before?&quot;  Quas took the letter and opened it to read.<br><br>  &quot;I found out Shiobahn was recently married.  The entire prospect is rather frightening to dwell on.&quot;  Millikin replied.<br><br>  &quot;Well, it was somewhat impromptu.&quot;  Quasqueton looked up from the letter.  &quot;Don't worry.  Your cousin is in good hands and capable of fending for herself fairly well.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;I was more concerned about the safety of the general population of Norrath.&quot;  Autumn snickered softly at Millikin's comment.<br><br>  &quot;And just what is THAT supposed to mean?&quot;  Quasqueton huffed.  Millikin glanced northwards, in the direction of the Temple of Veeshan, her thoughts distracted.  &quot;Can I send you somewhere, &quot;cousin&quot;?  He asked, his tone laced with a touch of sarcasm.  Millikin looked at him after a moment.<br><br>  &quot;Just the thought of two fire crazy wizards running loose and working in concert is...&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Frightening.&quot;  Autumn stated deadpan.<br><br>  &quot;... disconcerting.&quot;  Millikin tacked on.  Grinning slightly to Autumn.<br><br>  &quot;I'll be sure to torch a tree or two just for you.&quot;  Quasqueton gazed poignantly at Millikin, his eyes glinted with a trace of humor.<br><br>  &quot;I know of a very large one you can't possibly miss.&quot;  The ranger replied dryly.  &quot;It's called the Earthmelder.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Hrmph.&quot;  Quasqueton sniffed, knowing exactly the &quot;tree&quot; that the ranger was referring to.  <br><br>  &quot;Actually, I don't know if you're familiar with her or not, nor if you keep up with practitioners of enchantment but do you know the Luhtmauyar Valdayana D`Varr?  I've something for her.&quot;<br><br>Quasqueton tucked the letter away into a pocket and a sudden rumbling was heard in the distance, indicative that a storm was approaching.<br><br>  &quot;D`Varr?  The name's familiar but I'm fairly sure I haven't met her formally.  Sorry.&quot;  He replied.<br><br>  &quot;Its almost as if she's fallen from the face of Norrath.&quot;  Millikin shook her head.  Snow began to fall at a steady pace and even gave Millikin pause.  Why didn't the animals seek cover beforehand?<br><br>  &quot;It seems almost unnatural.&quot;  She remarked mostly to herself.<br><br>  &quot;If you've a hunch of where she is, I can send you there.  Or close by.&quot;  Quasqueton offered, presuming that Millikin was speaking of the one whom she was searching for. <br><br>  &quot;If you could, the Nexus of Luclin please.  It will be easier to start from there.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;I really hate this place.&quot;  Autumn mumbled.  Quasqueton Fyrestrike gripped his staff and began another incantation, summoning energies to tear through the borders of time and space.  He calmly watched as they gathered around the ranger.  <br><br>  &quot;To the Great Divide, Autumn?&quot;  He paused.  For a brief second the eldritch beams that gathered around the ranger had disjoined but they quickly reformed and then she was gone.<br><br><br>~~~~~<br><br>Autumnwyld Crescendo is the sole property of her creator and used only for roleplaying purposes with prior consent.
