<br>
I opened my eyes momentarily staring at the dim light from the candle on the small table at the side of my bed, the closed my eyes again. I felt myself leave the bed suddenly as the covers leaped off my body and fell to the floor at the side of my bed.<br>
<br>
&quot;I saaIID!!&quot; the voice proclaimed starting out small and ending vicious as I felt a deep pain in my back. I fall hardly to the bed as the man broke the Dead Man Floating spell &quot;WAKE UP&quot;.<br>
<br>
My eyes quickly opened as I became super aware almost morphing to me back looking up at the smile of the rigid dark blue face of my father. He stood there with his lips wide apart showing me his bloodstained fangs as he smiled darkly.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is time for your final lesson before you go out into the world,” he said as I sat up slowly watching him intently waiting for his next show of love. I rubbed the now sore middle of my back where he planted his staff to wake me &quot;if you are ever going to master the art of plague and disease, you are going to start learning a little discipline...after all, you are a Bonedancer&quot; he finished. &quot;Meet me in hall&quot; as he called the training room as he turned and left my room.<br>
<br>
I blinked and sighed in relief as he left still rubbing my back. Today would be my last day in this foul city...this plague infested house...this...vomit eating... I hated my father. The way he laughed when he knew he had beaten me, the way he smiled and walked around talking aloud to the air about how great he was in his day and how I will never be as good a Master of the dead as he. I even remember him saying once &quot;I should have killed you when you were born&quot;<br>
<br>
I entered the large room with the small wooden char at one end and a podium at the other. My father stood there behind the podium in all his glory. His short gray hair finely combed, he glared at me with fiery hatred as I enter the room not moving a muscle. He thought he was so god-like. The long red and black robes fall perfectly from him while he stood there with his fingers weaved together at his waist.<br>
<br>
&quot;By oath of our bloodline, today I am giving you your last lesson, but if you think for a single instance you filthy little squeezings from the arse of a troll, that your success matters to me, then you would be better off throwing yourself from the castle of Mistmoore while proclaiming to the world that your life was a waste of a poorly made soul&quot; he said as the look in his eyes spewed hatred for me.<br>
<br>
He made his way from behind the podium as he picked up the staff that lean against the tall wooden box. &quot;Summon your pet&quot; he said as he came to the center of the room and stood there smiling evilly with some sort of wicked plan to just defecate me yet again. I made a slight gesture as I closed my eyes to form a skeleton from out of the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;At least you can do that,” he said with his lips tightened wanting so much an excuse to defile me, as he so loved doing. &quot;Now make your pet attack me&quot;. This was a trick order. If I forced my pet to attack me, he would easily banish my pet and then in some fashion or another hurt me, but if I disobeyed, he would punish me for that.<br>
<br>
I had not spoken yet this morning, so I replied &quot;yes father&quot; and knowing that this would be my last day here, there was nothing to lose. I watched as I commanded my pet to run at him and then fall to the ground just as it came to his feet. Hatred suddenly welled up in his face as he stepped forward to charge me with his staff raised. &quot;YOU WORTHLESS...&quot; he began to shout as my pet raised from the ground and thrust the tips of its fingers into the base of his neck. &quot;AaaHHH&quot; he yelled as he turned around and shattered the walking skeleton.<br>
<br>
Turning back to me he stepped forward as he raised his hand cursing me with disease with one hand and throwing his other into my chest causing me fall hardly into the chair behind me. &quot;You know what really pisses me off&quot; he began to say, &quot;you cant even follow a simple order. I tried...I have done all I can to make you a great Necromancer, but you FU**** it all up. My efforts were a waste of energy. Look at you in all your retardedness. How dare you sit there in my presence filthing the air that I breathe with your intolerable existence&quot;.<br>
<br>
I lay there in the chair becoming weak from the disease spell, sores beginning to open up on my face. He walked around the chair pacing in all his self-proclaimed wisdom as he stops and gashes a finger into my throat infecting me with poison. He walked around to the front of the now puss dripping chair to stand in front of me and spoke again. &quot;I should have killed you when you were born&quot;<br>
<br>
Then with one swift stroke, be busted me in the mouth with his staff. I made a painful sound as blood spurted from my lips knocking my front teeth lose. He hit me so hard that my head hit the back of the chair and caused me to bounce forward and land on my hands and knees. I blinked as tears welled up in my eyes and tried to regain sense from the dizziness in my head. I gasped trying to catch my breath as pieces to teeth and blood string from my mouth to the floor.<br>
<br>
Quickly he finished by kicking me in the stomach and then bashing his staff to the back of my head where there was already an open wound. I staggered as I made another hurtful cry. I began to sob quietly through the tears and blood welling up in my throat, then fell to the ground to lay in my own pool of blood and disease.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your lesson is over, I can teach you no more, you will never learn...NEVER,” he said as he walked from the room.<br>
<br>
I lay there for 2, maybe three hours slowly bleeding to death before I began to think again. I had to leave before he came back, but didn’t have the strength. I blinked, as I lay limp watching a rat lapping at the now cold blood that had seeped from my mouth and ran along the seemline into the corner. Whispering to the rat in his mind, I tried coaxing the creature to me. &quot;I need you,” I thought to it &quot;come to me&quot;.<br>
<br>
It took me perhaps 20 minutes before convincing the rat t come to me. Still broken and barely able to move, it took all my might through the pain to move my arm around and take hold of the fury little beast. It squealed and squirmed as I sunk my longated fangs into its belly. &quot;AAAAHHHH&quot; I thought as the warm blood poured into my mouth giving me life and strength again. <br>
<br>
I lay there for awhile as the blood from the rat creeped through my body slowly healing my wounds. It took longer than normal, as I was poisoned, diseased, and beaten. An hour or so I think.<br>
<br>
Swiftly and in one motion, I rose to me feet, new life pulsing in my veins. I smiled wickedly as I look up toward the door. My father never taught me that I could heal myself from the life of another. I really don’t think he expected me to recover from this one.<br>
<br>
I fled with almost light speed through the door toward his study chamber with the roar of the air trailing behind me. I WAS faster, stronger, more powerful than he knew. He didn’t expect me.<br>
<br>
The door to his study shattered into splinters as the force from my mind blew it from its hinges. &quot;Hello father&quot; I said as I smiled coldly at him &quot;I have something for you&quot;. He quickly turned around in his chair trying to stand. I stepped forward and pressed my foot against his chest and bent forward looking him in the eyes as I began to speak with my lips only a breathe way from his. &quot;If there is one thing you underestimated about me it is this father. All this time you assumed I was weak...you knew for certain in your heart that I did not have the strength or the knowledge to be what you so wanted me to become&quot;.<br>
<br>
His lips began to tremble in fear as he tried to push off me and was unable. I wasn’t weak, or slow, or retarded...I was saving my power, all my might for this day...for this one single moment when I would watch you defecate yourself in fear when you knew what was about to happen&quot;.<br>
<br>
Without so much as a movement or word a Skeleton rose from the ground and materialized beside me as I spoke. &quot;You thought you were so powerful, so wondrous in all your might. Did you not think for one moment that I would not remember, that I didn’t know what you were up to, that I wasn’t watching you, that I wouldn’t learn from you even when you tried keeping the truth from me&quot;?<br>
<br>
I pushed off him and took a few steps back and watched as me pet moved in front of him. I couldn’t help but laugh with such great pleasure as wind welled up in the room creating a deafening roar as I shouted through the fury, &quot;you see father, you weren’t a failure after all...you got exactly what you wanted&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH&quot; my father roared suddenly as I smiled wickedly and whispered &quot;kill him&quot;. With one rigid movement, the skeleton thrusted its hand into my father's chest and tore out his heart. I closed my eyes and whispered &quot;thank you&quot; as his heart fell from the pet’s hand into his lap. Then opened my eyes to be standing at the Entrance to Nerak in Nektulos Forrest Pet at my side.<br>
