Vis hasnt always been perfect but we try very hard to be fair.  Its not hard pleasing everyone and doing the best for yourself.  We never would intention hurt someone.  The wyvren incodent is just silly.  We got all these accusations thrown at us right off the bat too.  Personaly I dont want to help someone thats being rude especially when no one felt it was our fault.  We never put the wyvren outside HoT it always goes in a unoccupied alcove.  Mistakes happen and a lot overreacted and accused.  =/  And we did consider going out of our way to go back and go out of our way to move it but you were just so rude we didnt.  Can you blame us?<br>

Comunication is a very big key to this game since we cant talk or use body language things come off wrong.  Think before you type the world would be a better place.<br>

And damn, i send him tells and he NEVER Responds!!!!!<br>
Like he is always zoning when i send him a tell? WTF? he should learn to stop when i send him a dang tell!<br>
And like this one day i was in seb, and i asked this guyz if my friends sisters twink could group with him and he said no. W T F?? i meen O M G HOW RUDE!<br>
<br>
And so like this one time this guy in  ViS Moiarr! He was training, and i had shout turned off!! and the little gerk didnt even have the NERVE to say train in ooc! i meen come on! Like its my responsibility to turn on shout just for him!. Hes such a jerk all he does is train all day i just know it, i bet you if i played for more then 1.5 hours a day i could see him training<br>
<br>
and like W   T   F   there was this mob some idiot trained us but like i know it was this Vis Maeorr guy, like i never seen him but im so sure!!!!!! IT WAS HIM OMG!!!!~~~<br>
<br>
SO like and umm... This one time i sent him a tell calling him a (*&amp;*(&amp; then said i did his mom in a *(&amp;#$ like manner, and he has the nerve to get mad at me? COME ON FOLKS! Cant you see?<br>
<br>
And like he his this weapon, like WTF? just becuase he has this weapon he thinks hes the best of all servers! well inever actually asked him what he thought of himself BUT IM SURE he thinks highly of his self hes so conceded.<br>
<br>
And so i was at the zone, And me and 5 of my buddy's wanted this camp, we were just waiting for our cler, chanter, mage 3 more wars, and the rest of our melee, and the rest of our guilds and freinds to log on. But we were there! all 5 of us. Just needed 25 more to kill this guy. And like WTF? like vis zoned in and had 40 ppl, so i didnt think much of  it, then they went and killed my mob!!!!!!!<br>
And like man i had my 5 guyz there. So i petitioned so from now on the GM will save the camp from the entire server, just so my friends and guild can log on, Cuz its not fair! i should be allowed to log on whenever i dang well please and have Aall MY mobs up. <br>
<br>
Man Vis mioarer is such a crappy guild, ive never seen so many newbies, im mean come in its obvious! Just becuase ima  looser and ive been playing this game 5 times longer then any one else, and the most biggest raid i can get is a juggs raid DOESNT MEEN i suxor&gt; Man i am so much better then that entiure guild, just becuase i never got any where cuz all i  do is talk @#%$ about ppl and flame ppl for the pure fun of it. still WTF? man i swear im gunna petition for GMS to make me equivelent to Vulak. And while im at it i want his loot. <br>
<br>
So like another time i remember. My friend needed this camp so we just zoned in and went to camp it, but we didnt check to see if any one else was camping it. but i shouldnt have to the entier server i think should resolve around me<br>
oh wait leme add that to my petition<br>
any how so like on the other side of the  hill was vis, but since i failed to check to see if any one was in the zone.<br>
<br>
NO WAIT ya.... thats it... i did check.... VIS WASNT THERE... i swear on my honor!~ they werent there<br>
<br>
*Vis guy says, dude we been sitting at this hill for 3 hours'<br>
<br>
OMFG U LIAR I WAS HERE FIRST THIS IS MY CAMP<br>
<br>
Man this Vis Major guild is just sick. i meen come on, t<br>
<br>
Any how this 1 vis Meoar guy is such a looser, man i bet the entire guild is just like him. I only know about 3 out of the 60+ members, and i havnt talked to either of them since i last traiend them *errr *couch* ya those bastards were in my way and i was pulling~~<br>
Any how i bet the entire guild is just like that one gerk off from vis maear. But i never really made an effort to talk to any one in that guild to see what peeps are like, its much easier to assume they are all jerk offs!<br>
<br>
Soo leek man!!! SO NEVER TALK TO THEM<br>
THEY ARE ALL THE DEVIL<br>
Especially ARKINIA AND TIPU. Man tipu sent me a tell once<br>
*Tipu tells you, 'Heya mate how ya doin <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> '<br>

Ya i remember it excactly. it was in Maidens eye in september 1st on year 2001. YA YOU TRAINED ME THEN I REMEMBER HAHAHAH I GOT YOU NOW<br>

That's really all I was trying to say.

Baeananaanon, there's no way I'm going to read your 50-page post.<br>

And Mella/Malla, you're seriously one of the only people in Vis that I can and do respect (other than my friends Mugen and Gorce).  Remember when Combac ran into your little 8-person meeting in Toxx and Hits tried to duel him?  And I told you the only reason I left was because of you?  Because I respect you.  Why?

<br>
Vis is Vis is Uber.  They do what they do, and 90% us never actually see them... nor honestly care.  Sure, they had some really notorious individuals in the past... but last I checked, the Moho's and the Biffins are long gone from the guild.<br>
