Regardless of the person's attitude... isnt it kinda well... rude to be recruiting with several guilds at once?<br>
<br>
I don't think there's anything wrong with putting feelings out, to find out that &quot;guild x&quot; &quot;guild y&quot; and &quot;guild z&quot; are recruiting... that you have a friend in &quot;guild a&quot;, etc...<br>
<br>
But when you sit back and go... &quot;Gee... all these guilds are nice... but I like 'guild c' best... I think I'd like to join them...&quot; (for whatever reasons, you like to raid, don't like to raid, the atmosphere is good....).... shouldn't you see where that goes?  Instead of trying to join several at once?<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
Again, I don't think there's anything wrong with scoping out guilds... but when you say &quot;I'd like to join you&quot;... I think you should stick with that one until you join, they decide they don't want you, or based on further meetings with that guild, you decide they are not for you.<br>

Rhes, Your are the punk who thinks nothing but of himself, I can remember time and time again YOU sending me tells about no one was helping you and you thought it was BS, and then you tried to make it off as if it were a WT or some bull crap like that, Your just as worse as me <br>
<br>
Auggust, Your a bitch...Nothing i can say to that but I was never needy in MC, if needy about anything it was to raid and have fun and get things moving, I even have text saved where people thought what i was saying was whining and have showed alot of my friends who think other wise <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Drevis, Your just as worse as they are, you never forgive anyone. what I did wasn't as nearly as i've done now/or in the past after u booted me from VOR and you know my beef i have with you so i will just drop you<br>
<br>
to the stupid bard, I dont know you, but i left SM because they were a bunch of morons who didnt know how to do anything and kept trying to camp low lvl stuff and i was freakin lvl 55<br>
<br>
to Sephrok and the Paladin, you know my beef with you guys and you didnt really say anything so i will leave you two alone.<br>
<br>
To the Valhalla's Pyre Member, I did NOT flame anyone in VP nor there friends, if anything they flamed me. If you wanna look down upon me for that then go screw yourself. I tried approaching them as a friend, Not anything else...not my fault that some of them hated me, but hey thats life!<br>
<br>
To the person who made a comment about what i'm doing isn't really wrong, Thank you maybe there is hope out there for the best of you.<br>
<br>
To anyone else who has read this bull crap , the person who posted is either Nitch or Nerve. either one they did a excellent job of covering themselves even if it wasn't but something tells me it was them.<br>
<br>
You people who posted about me is the reason why our server is known as bunch of idiots, because NONE Of you listen to anything good, you go straight to the bad. You all forgot to mention the endless times i have helped you with epic stuff or items or anything, or for christ sake (in your sake Auggust) Listening!, thats the number one thing I did best out of all of you. I was a friend, You will all get what you deserve in the end. maybe not today or tomorrow but it will come to you and i hope then you realize that its not nice to flame other people.<br>
<br>
Until then, I hope all of you who posted to this mindless bull crap post rott in hell some day because I know what I did wasn't as bad as the way you've all acted towards me.<br>

Lindril is one of the sweetest ladies i know on this server. There was no call to bash on her for stating what from the post here would appear to be true...Although I couldn't find  the post on VP mb, I have many friends in VP and I know that they are a class act group who generally dont flame at all. <br>
<br>
IF you dislike this server so much then why dont you go do a /servermove and get away from these so called idiots. I have found Many Many people on this server who are the complete oposite. <p><center>

One thing I have found out about this board is although not many post, there are a lot of people that read it.  All you have accomplished with your profane posting, Rainwynds, is a total alienazation of the readers of this board.  You may curse me all you like, and I am sure you will find quite a few people that will cheer you on.  However, when you call Auggust a *bitch*, you have stepped over the line.  <br>
<br>
You are a scoundrel.  Calling you dogshit would be an insult to the animal that it came out of.  I for one am sick of your presence, and I despise you in the utmost.  From this moment forth, you or anyone that aligns themselves with you is persona-non-grata to me.<br>

Rhes is one of the most giving and helpful people I have known in this game. Yes, he can be blunt..but I have found that only people who cant handle the truth have a problem with that.<br>
2. NO WAY would he ever have complained that people weren't helping him..not in his nature to do so.<br>
3. Yes, I kept talking to you even after you caused so much disruption in MCs..because I felt a bit sorry for you after the story you told me of your sad real life problems. But to say you 'listened' to me..well, I would not have shared any of my life with you. I was trying to be civil..and give you the benefit of the doubt..that your behaviour was more a result of plain immaturity than of flawed character.<br>
