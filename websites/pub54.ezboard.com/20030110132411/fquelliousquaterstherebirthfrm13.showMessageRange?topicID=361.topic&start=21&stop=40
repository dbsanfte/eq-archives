If a law were drafted today that respected God as the endower of rights I believe that should be struck down.<br>
<br>
I believe that the &quot;In God we trust&quot; should be stricken from the bills because it is a lie.  If I am included in the &quot;we&quot; then it is not true that we all trust in god.  If I am not included than I have to wonder who gets to make the decision that I am not.<br>
<br>
The seperation of church and state is an idea that emerges from the first amendment.  It is not enumerated in the constitution but is found in a supreme court decision (Everson v Board) by Justice Black (usually a stark literalist) who wrote, <br>
<br>
&quot;The &quot;establishment of religion&quot; clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;a wall of separation between church and State.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
It might not literally say it, but according to the Supreme Court that is what it means.  By creating an official time to say the pledge the state is forcing people to profess their belief or disbelief.<br>
<br>
Linking to Mcarthyism is not far fetched in the least.  'Under God' was added to fight against atheist-communism and nothing more.  <br>
<br>
To say that it isn't coercive is to say that there is no peer pressure.  I got in many arguments with people when I refused to stand for the pledge or say 'Under God.'  Most people just assume you're a stupid little punk or rebel and don't understand the insult it is.  Imagine being the lone child in a class who does not believe in God and feeling suddenly out of place with society.<br>
<br>
Removing 'Under God' is not forcing my views on anyone else.  I'm not making you say, &quot;one nation, under absolutely no creator, ...&quot; I'm advocating for state neutrality in the issue where they make no assumptions of religious matters, not that they assume that there is nothing.  It is the Judeo-Christian belief that is pushed upon people by knowing that congress officially assumes a creator which is preposterous imho.  <br>
<br>
Schools can and should teach tolerance and good citizenship, but must not favor one religion over another or belief over non-belief. To do otherwise would, in the words of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, “send a message to nonadherents that they are outsiders, not full members of the …community.” <br>

When deciding on the constitutional nature of a law, the court will look into WHY the law was made. <br>
<br>
Congressman Louis C. Rabaut from Michigan was the House sponsor of the bill which added “under God” to our Pledge. Rabaut testified before a congressional committee in support of the legislation. He said <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
 “the children of our land, in the daily recitation of the pledge in school, will be daily impressed with a true understanding of our way of life and its origins.” <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The President of the United States in 1954 was Dwight Eisenhower, who said when he signed the legislation <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
 “From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural schoolhouse, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty.”<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
From this, it seems that they knowingly were inserting words to inject into schools a belief in God. This can be construed as Congress passing a law to endorse a religious point of view.  While in this case it happens to coincide with my beliefs, I'm certain that another case in the future could contradict my beliefs.  <br>
<br>
We do have to be wary of indoctrination by our government schools, but honestly, this &quot;under God&quot; phrase is probably the smallest worry in a long list of things that bother me about what's taught in our schools these days.  The current government school agenda appears to want the next generation to be disrespectful of our founding fathers and their beliefs, those who have died to protect us and our liberties, and too dumb to know better. <br>
<br>
What our founding fathers achieved is an amazing document and system that was greater then themselves. Our nation was founded with radical ideas, about freedom, liberty, self-determination, and economy. They took some of the best ideas about government from history, wrapped them up and put them to work. Our founding fathers were extremists, because extremeists make dreams become reality.  They were also for the most part Christians of one flavor or another.  That CANNOT be discounted when appraising what they created, because to allow freedom is a radical belief built upon by faith in God and man.<br>
<br>
From what our kids seem to be taught these days, our founding fathers were a bunch of bigoted slave owning scumbags, and today's America is oppressive, isolationist, domineering, imperialist, weak, corrupt, and warmongering zealots. Or so they say.  <br>
<br>
The arguement made by the man behind the court case (I heard him on the radio today) is that so much evil has been done in the world due to and in the name of religion, so he feels religion should be stricken from the Pledge.  He totally fails to realize that evil is evil, and is not tied to religion, any more than massive fires are tied to Mrs. O'Leary's cow.  Yes, it does happen, but Stalin and Mao were anti-religion (more accuratly, pushed a religion of The State) and killed a combined 50+ million people.  He also seems to miss that Athiesm is a belief system too.  <br>
<br>
In a way I feel sorry for him, because he seems to have missed that it's not religion in these cases that was bad, it was Power.  Powerful men in powerful positions who abused that power.  Torquemada, Bin Laden, Stalin, Mao, Jim Jones, and many others have committed terrible acts, not due to their professed belief systems, but due to the corruption of power.  By being able to kill or imprison a man with a word.  Being able to enforce their convenience on others.  <br>
<br>
And in this case, isn't what this man is trying to do to the country?  <br>
<br>
And the constitution is not only there to protect the minority from the majority (it doesn't do that all that well) it's there to protect the majority from the minority.  (See South Africa:Apartheid)<br>

<br>
All quotes Varro's.<br>
<br>
&quot;No one is taking away your right to say a single thing. All this decision does is allow those who do not believe to be included in taking the pledge.&quot;<br>
<br>
Where did they take a kid's right to remain silent (no pun intended) in this entire ordeal? This ruling could open the lawsuit floodgates. An atheist’s rights are violated for the mere mention of a word? Can I sue Bush for liberally sprinkling his speeches with God? Non/Religious tolerance is a two way street, to include atheists.<br>
<br>
When I *do* hear of a kid being kicked out of school or sent to the corner for refusing to say the pledge with his peers I'll take this matter more seriously. Even then it should be handled locally, and if it isn't it can gain momentum. But a new incident shouldn't sweep the nation in contempt overnight.<br>
<br>
&quot;All day I've heard congressmen and others talking about the consensus of opinion in this issue [snip]&quot;<br>
<br>
It's called majority rule. That's how officials are elected. That's why Petco stops shelving cat food with a brand that doesn't make money for another that may and your pet is s hit out of luck, but the company will remain. I'm all for everyone's opinions/issues to be heard, but god damn, some side has to give.<br>
<br>
&quot;100 years from now, maybe 200, our descendants will look upon this decision as the correct one, and whatever backlash comes against it today will be looked upon with sadness.&quot;<br>
<br>
You want to know what's really sad? The lack of foresight on your part to see a domino effect in political life. This ruling isn’t going to silence fundamentalists. It is extreme and baseless bumps in American politics like this one that recharges the GOP and like-minded supporters. It’s a great opportunity for Republicans behind on approval ratings to pound a podium, tuck a Bible under their arm, and sing the national anthem to cheers of voters that want their newfound patriotism reflected in laws rooted in religion I can’t stomach, like chipping away at Roe v. Wade. No doubt this father’s ego swelled. But who the f uck cares for consequences in the immediate future? By your suggestion, it’s right to inconvenience greater society--yeah, go ahead and claim that I mean to say you are “less than great”--on behalf of the minority.<br>
<br>
“Under God” doesn’t rank up there in importance to murder and theft, a basic infringement on a good life that different peoples from different places can come to an agreement on. It’s trivial. It’s a relic. It can be compared to bylaws and rule of thumbs in state ordinances reaching back to the beginning of the last century that are so insipid, so fundamentally stupid no one bothers to recognize the flaw of their congressional predecessors, let alone lift a finger to take them off the books.<br>
<br>
“Leaving 'God' everywhere in government suggests that 'Americans believe in God'…”<br>
<br>
Is this false?<br>
<br>
“…and being that I don't it must mean that I'm not a ‘true’ American.”<br>
<br>
Hard-line racists and similar dregs aside, Eleanor Roosevelt once said, No one can insult me without my permission.<br>
<br>
“School children are very impressionable and while they are not forced to pledge allegiance, they are forced to make a political statement if they choose not to speak.”<br>
<br>
If you were anything like the kids in my school you didn’t give a monkey dick about the morning ritual. Your thoughts were on the straw inside your desk and rolling the ball of paper, ready for wetting, in your free hand as you barely managed to conjure the words in your head for the pledge.  <p>______________________<p>

<br>
If you'd actually pay attention you might figure something out.  It isn't that a word is mentioned, it is the authority that mentions it.  The authority to teachers is granted by the government and the pledge was authorized by congress.  I don't see why your personal religious beliefs have to become part of doctrine from a body that represents the total population, especially given that the seperation of church and state demands that the authority be seperated from religion.<br>
<br>
As to Majority rule, i'll quote Madison, &quot;[M]easures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.&quot; This is why we aren't a democracy and are instead a republic<br>
<br>
Yes murder is more important than 'under god', but do we ignore theft because we should really be worried about murder? That argument is the last resort of those who have nothing to say.  <br>
<br>
Drevis, I'd like you to make an actual argument at some point, it'd be interesting to see if you could.  It'd be like seeing a monkey talk, or some other interesting novelty.  If you have nothing constructive to say except to prove you've got a big dick with an american flag on it then shut the f uck up.<br>

No one is ever forced to say the pledge, no one is ever thought less of for saying it so why worry about it? <p><p align="center"><a

<br>
That's part of it, but even moreso because, as I stated previously, the pledge of allegiance is an oath of loyalty.  If your convictions or beliefs preclude you from reciting such an oath then you shouldn't do so.<br>
<br>
and  &quot;I don't it must mean that I'm not a ‘true’ American.”<br>
<br>
Well, since you want to try an extremist method as justification of trying to erase the fact that a belief in God is what inspired the establishment of this country (Revisionist history), unless you are a Native American then no, you are NOT a true American.  If you are, then you might have a legitimate claim of disenfranchisement as an American by the U. S government in my eyes.  If you embrace the concept that Americans are anyone who accepts and defends the ideals of freedom and basic liberty for all regardless of race, nationality, or religious beliefs, why do you care what others believe?  The pledge is an oath of loyalty to those ideals not a demand for you to renounce your beliefs simply because of a reference to a deity.  You're not even asked to swear that loyalty by said god, unlike swearing an oath to tell the truth in court.<br>
<br>
&quot;BTW, read up on some Jefferson before you attribute Christianity to all the founders, Jefferson was quite a deist in many ways.&quot;<br>
<br>
At no point did I attribute Christianity as the practicing religion of all the founders.  Acknowledgment of the existence of the Christian god does not make one a Christian.  Secondly, Thomas Jefferson was a Freemason and many of their basic ideas are similar to deism (Another philosophy/religion that acknowledges the existence of a god.)  While Freemasonry does not espouse one god over another, (They only require you to believe in one central divine being.  Usually generically referred to as the Creator or the Architect.) they claim their origins trace back to a sect of Judaism that arose at the time of King Soloman's reign.  Sounds to me like he was a believer in a single god.<br>
<br>
Varro states:  &quot;Now that is one big stupid stupid stupid statement. It appears you don't understand the difference between espousing the existence of a god and asserting that some people believe in and are motivated by God.&quot;<br>
<br>
No basis of fact?  Is my assertion that a push for removal for books of any sort of &quot;religious&quot; theme be called for removal really so stupid?  Take a look at the rise of different empires/regimes in history.  People with agendas to fulfill always attack some national or cultural symbol first.  Then it's on to books with different ideas, then intellectuals/scientists who support borderline, unpopular, or opposing views.  It's a gradual progression.  They aren't going to target the mundane everyday items (like money) that everyone sees on a daily basis until their ideas have become entrenched in the minds of the average majority.  <br>
<br>
Books are banned in communities across the U. S. for usage of words like &quot;nigger&quot;, references to witchcraft (A religious practice that sometimes espouses the belief of a higher power), even expressing an unorthodox view of some of the different mainstream religions in the world today.  You have people swearing up and down that events like the Holocaust didn't happen or that the moon landing was faked and they're taken seriously.  Delthanor and I can't possibly be the only people who are noticing this current trend of vilifying of this nation's founders as justification to try and eliminate and all references to its foundation.<br>
<br>
Varro states:  &quot;Most people just assume you're a stupid little punk or rebel and don't understand the insult it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Most kids refusing to recite the pledge were stupid little punks simply trying to get a rise out of their teacher and disrupt the class.  However, where I lived, refusing to say the pledge quickly got old when Jehovah's Witnesses started attending the school and they refused to recite the pledge for religious reasons. The one I knew stated she didn't recite it because they didn't believe in swearing any form of oath to anyone other than God.  At least she has a legitimate reason why as opposed to &quot;Nyah, nyah you can't make me say it so I'm not gonna say it.&quot;  And it wasn't really a big deal.<br>
<br>
Varro states:  &quot;This is an argument with no basis and is just to inspire a fear of religious persecution by an atheist minority when the truth is that atheism is much more likely to be persecuted.&quot;<br>
<br>
and  <br>
<br>
&quot;Imagine being the lone child in a class who does not believe in God and feeling suddenly out of place with society.&quot;<br>
<br>
Historically, it's people who have taken a stand on supporting their religion who have been persecuted and/or murdered for it, not people denying the existence thereof.  If are you implying that atheists don't try to push their beliefs on others, insult, or persecute those who do believe in a god then I'm going to have to tell you from personal direct experience that you're dead wrong.  I've been singled and called a stupid fool in front of the entire class for believing in a god by a professed atheist teacher.  Anyone who has the courage to stand up for their convictions is going to find themselves shunned when it goes against the status quo.  That's a fact of life.  Deal with it and move on.<br>
<br>
Gaelron states:  &quot;If you were raised without religion would you believe in the same way?&quot;<br>
<br>
I can't answer that accurately.  My experiences involving religion have influenced my beliefs.  Just as my parents were influenced by religion as they grew up.  I think the only person who could probably answer that most accurately would be someone who was raised atheist, but even then I think that religion would have impacted their experiences and beliefs.<br>

If they tried to do this back when the Constitution was written, they would have been tared feathered and ran out of town on a rail {and since there was no rail roads back then, it would have been quite a feet}.  In short, Christianity can be seen almost every where you look, when looking at the goverments of the 1700's, 1800's and most of the 1900's.  This nonsence is just resent BS from people who do not want to acclimate into America's society, but want us to acclimate into whatever they feel is the right way of doing things {please note this is Americans of many generations here as well as imrigrants that have just arived} <br>
<br>
The seperation of &quot;Church and State&quot; and &quot;Freedom of Relgion&quot; was never supposed to be interpreted this way at any streach of the imagination.  It was meant to protect individuals with diffrent views from the majority, not to force us to live like them or in a community where the citizens are afraid to say something in fear that they are going to be sued or fired for it.<br>
<br>
This is wrong.  They should leave it as is and tell the people who do not like it to go find a place where they feel comfortable, not try and to force the rest of the Country to live up/down to the stanards they think are right.<br>

<br>
<br>
Millikin, thanks for being 100x the arguer Drevis is<br>
<br>
My point with the book issue is not that I doubt the possibility of books being banned, but that I believe that issue is seperate from the one we are talking about.  It is a what if claim that really has no basis in this argument because the reasons for banning a book are quite different from the reasons for removing &quot;Under God&quot; from the pledge.  Removing under god is to ensure the impartial nature of state authority when referring to religion.  God has a place in school, but it would be in a comparative religion course, or history, etc... not in a pledge.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not suggesting that atheists don't attack religious beliefs on a personal level, but that is protected speech, just as it is the right of a guy at my uni to carry around a sign saying that I as an atheist am a disgusting creature to him.  I respect people of faith and I'm glad this topic hasn't degenerated into a pro/anti Christianity thread.  If your teacher ridiculed you for your beliefs you have the right to protest and some would argue the responsibility to do so, so he doesn't ridicule any other people of faith.<br>
<br>
People of faith have historically been oppressed, I agree with that completely, but I must argue that they were oppressed by people of a different faith in most cases.  The issue is more related to the beliefs of the majority or elite vs the beliefs of the powerless.  As you said, it is a battle against the status quo.  <br>
<br>
I believe in the constitution.  There is a school of thought that true patriotism is criticizing and evaluating the government to keep them true to the ideals this country was founded upon.  For those who want to argue that we aren't following the intent of the framers I ask what do you know about the original interpretation of our bill of rights.  For a while people thought freedom of speech just meant you couldn't be arrested prior to writing offensive material, but you could be afterward.  Search and siezure rules were unenforcable because if evidence was taken without a warrant it could still be used in court.  How about seperate but equal, dread scott, and other cases involving civil rights.  The Supreme Court is given the authority to rule on the meaning of the constitution for a reason.  Times change and ideals change.  The founding fathers are at a disadvantage of 200+ years.<br>
<br>
How the majority can misconstrue this as the tyranny of a minority group is beyond me.  In those western states affected by this ruling you as an individual can still say the pledge of allegiance until your tongue goes numb.  At my old highschool students used to pray around the flag pole every morning.  These are perfectly fine to me and I salute those who wish to express their beliefs.  The only thing that changes is that you can not set aside spacific class time to say the pledge because that is government endorcement of religion, if not a specific religion, then at least the existence of a higher power.  That government endorcement is what is wrong, not the expression of belief.<br>

<br>
Anytime any law is in acted, the Constitutional question should be simple.  As the founders of this country ment the Constitution, would they say yea or nay to this given law {whatever law you are refering to}?<br>
<br>
If you think they would have said nay, you are lying to yourself.  Is the Constitutions perfect? No!!!, but it is our Country and that is the law of this Country.  I wish I could declare this the end of the discussion, but our infamous courts and their judges who think their interpretation of the Constitiution is better than the people who wrote it, will probably prove me wrong before I can hit the &quot;Add Reply&quot; button.<br>

<br>
the issue here is one of the constitutionality of the act that added the words &quot;under God&quot; to the pledge of allegiance.  as we saw from the quote from President Eisenhower: &quot;From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural schoolhouse, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty,&quot; the motives behind its inclusion were questionable at best from a constitutional standpoint.  It was a political move by vote-coddling republicans that passed this act, and it is a political move of today's politicians to slam the new ruling without ever addressing the actual issue.  President Bush, our leading politician, showed his typical capacity for understanding the complexeties of an issue by simply calling the ruling &quot;ridiculous.&quot;<br>
<br>
the ruling was not ridiculous.  it was unpopular.  the ability to look past the surface at the details of an issue, and to go against the popular opinion if need be, is something our populace seems to be sadly lacking in.  it is the responsibility of each American citizen to exercise their powers of discernment, to think before they speak, and to constantly examine their thought processes.  differences of opinion will always exist, as they must in a democracy, and if those opinions are all educated and well expressed, our nation will be continue to be refined and bettered.  if the opinions of the masses are not educated, but are based rather on fear, dogma, superstition, or simple hive-mind syndrome, then our fragile democratic republic is in grave danger.<br>
<br>
this is what scares me the most about this entire episode; there has been so little difference of public opinion, so few people willing to look logically at the facts of the case.  everyone hears their leaders denouncing the ruling as ridiculous, and their opinions follow suite directly.  i'll admit this case is an easy target for the politicians to build popularity be denouncing it.  attacking an institution like the pledge of allegiance, at a time when feelings of nationalism and love of tradition are very high in our country, was unwise at best.  the timing was poor, and it is indeed of somewhat trivial importance compared to the other problems our nation is facing.  still, the band wagon jumping, hive mind mentality that i see happening here is truly frightening.<br>
<br>
Millikin, i challenge your assertion that our country was founded solely upon a belief in God: <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Well, since you want to try an extremist method as justification of trying to erase the fact that a belief in God is what inspired the establishment of this country (Revisionist history), unless you are a Native American then no, you are NOT a true American<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->.  many of our our ancestors came to this land from european nations who had a strong state-sponsored belief in God.  the new nation was founded in large part by persons believing in God, but it was not founded <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> on that belief</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  it was founded, rather, on a belief in freedom, an idea which was indeed radical in the european countries that harbored a strong belief in God.  this concept of freedom transcended in importance specific religious beliefs, and from it a country eventually emerged that is now a haven for free speech, freedom of thought, and freedom of religion.  it would be a terrible mistake to give away any of these aspects of our republic to satiate any party, be it the minority or majority.  <br>
<br>
is a belief in God too closely incorporated in our government?  i'm not going to debate that here, but i will say that it is a subject deserving of the attention and honest assessment of all american citizens.  to so readily dismiss it shows a mental lethargy and an unhealthy dependence on the consensus to form our opinions on important matters of state.  a democracy comprised of individuals such as this can not stand long.  please, think before you form your opinions, it is your responsibility to your nation.<br>

<br>
1) We should worry about kids learning to read and write before we worry about them pledging allegiance to a national symbol or praying.<br>
<br>
2) Yes, The president can say &quot;god&quot; whenever he wants.  The House and Senate have prayers before they open a session.  Why?  Because they are not establishing any religion, rather they are exercising their religious freedom.  When you have the schools endorsing religion by having children profess allegiance to a symbol and then make it religious you have a problem.<br>
<br>
3) As to other references to religion in the schools, they are in relation to history.<br>
<br>
4) As long as there are tests, there will be prayer in public school, but do you trust the government to provide the religious training to kids?  I don’t, and I work for the government.  How many people would object if the school would have the Children recite “under Allah?”  Why not have them say “under Jesus?” Because that would offend large minorities of people. <br>
<br>
5) As important as freedom of religion is, it is equally important to free from religion – ask the Afghans (people, not dogs).<br>
<br>
6) The bill of rights is not there for the majority it is there to protect the minority.<br>

A few points to make.<br>
<br>
1. Under God. Really folks, if you are not forced to say it, what's the big deal? It's not even saying what or whose god it is. People need to get over it.<br>
<br>
2. I'm a Christian. I can't pray in school. Why not? What about MY rights? <br>
<br>
3. If I weren't raised in a Christian family, I would still think this is all stupid. Like someone said earlier, (don't remember who, sorry.) we should be feeding the starving people out there and helping the abused children, not focusing on this crap. <br>
<br>
4. I forgot my other points. Sue me!  Oh wait, this is America.. you could. Nevermind. <p><center><img src="http://www.relinpor.com/sigs/zeiksig.jpg">

<br>
Last time I checked, America was founded by religious outcasts from Europe... people who fled their homelands in order to be able to practice their religious beliefs.<br>
<br>
These people believed in God.  His size, shape, and temperment varied a bit from demonination to demonination... but it all came back to God... and the freedom to worship him in the manner that people chose to do so.<br>
<br>
To deny this, is to deny the very foundations of American society.<br>
<br>
In the American society, we have norms... for right or wrong.  You are free to be a Jew, Christian, Athiest, etc... but the bottom line is that this freedom is the direct result of God, and people who came here to worship him.<br>
<br>
Included in your freedoms is the freedom to pack up and leave.  If you're unhappy with the use of the word &quot;God&quot;, or it's implications, why not try Great Britain?  No?  How about Russia?  No?  Hmmm... what about Iran?  Naw.  Turkey?  Yeah!  Turkey is a wonderful place.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day, and ummm... God bless you.<br>

You CAN pray in school.  No one is stopping you.  It is when the GOVERNMENT is assisting or directing prayer that it is a problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Quas--<br>
<br>
Incorrect -- you better check again.  This country was founded by PROFITEERS and CORPORATIONS.  The Pilgrims were about intolerant of relgious freedom as there was.  One colony -- Rhode Island -- was founded on the basis of religious freedom.  <br>
<br>
The people did not flee england becuase of religous persecution, they can over here to be separate from the religion of the day.  What you recite is the myth that was created in 1826 by Felicia Hermans after she read an article in a two year old paper that was used, literally, to wrap her fish.<br>

Just thought you might like to know.<br>

After seeing all sort of useless and idiotic drivel in other OT threads, I expected this one to sound off witht he same brand of muddle-headed chest-pounding. I am pleased to say that, for the most part, it hasn't.<br>
<br>
1) By _strict_ interpretation of the Establishment Clause (this whole seperation of Church and State thing), the phrase &quot;Under God&quot; in our Pledge is very much Unconstitutional. I say this because of the intent behind the addition of the phrase in 54 (I think). The intent, as others have covered, was to actively promote religion in the face of &quot;Godless Communism&quot;. Nuff said about the phrase's Unconstitutionality.<br>
<br>
2) The court's decision was not bone-headed, it was right. What was boneheded was the lawsuit. The jerk-off bringing suit is a rampant publicity hound. Look at his history of Mikey vs The US Govt type lawsuits on damned near everything even vaguely related to the Establishment clause. What a pud. It is my hope that his daughter grows up and rewards this man's callous manipulation of his own child with a great &quot;Mommy Dearest&quot; type book. He deserves it for this act, IMO.<br>
<br>
3) Any time &quot;God&quot; is brought up, people do tend to get overly excited. This is because many people are inherently and horribly insecure about their beliefs. Do you know which group gets the most excited and voluable, and thus looks the most insecure? The atheists. It has been a long time since atheists were actively persecuted for their lack of beliefs. It has been mere minutes since the last time an atheist persecuted a Christian for their state of Belief.<br>
<br>
4) To quote Varro, &quot;I don't see why your personal religious beliefs have to become part of doctrine from a body that represents the total population, especially given that the seperation of church and state demands that the authority be seperated from religion,&quot;. Interesting thought, Varro, considering you are espousing the use of that self-same authority to enforce your lack of religious beliefs on everyone else. Atheism, though it is a thoroughly bankrupt non-philosophy, has become a religion just like any other. It is simply less organized. Atheists use different terminology for their actions, but anyone with a bit of intelligence can look at atheism and see Missionary Work, Spreading the Word of No-God, etc. Give it up. Admit it. Atheism is a religion.<br>
<br>
5) Whenever this sort of argument comes up, people, again like Varro, love to bring up wonderfully poetic quotes about the Tyranny of the Majority. Yessiree, our nation is a Republic precisely to prevent the tyranny of the Majority. The problem here is that crap lawsuits like this swing the pendulum the other way. We have been victims of something far worse in the latter half of the XXth century and the start of the XXIst century - the Tyranny of the &quot;Oppressed&quot; Minority. How, precisely, do you rate? Do you pay that much in taxes? Do you support the pillars of society SO much that your every whim must be catared to? Are your sensibilities so delicate that you simply cannot abide by something so trivial? Yes, the phrase is Unconstitutional and should be struck, but why does this give you, the atheist, any right to &quot;pound the podium&quot; or &quot;preach from the pulpit&quot; as you accuse the Religious Right of doing. <br>
<br>
I am not one for Moral Relativism in the slightest, but this is one of thoce cases where the &quot;oppressed&quot; party is no better in the slightest than the &quot;oppressing&quot; party. They rail against the vile majority &quot;forcing&quot; majority beliefs on them, and thus seek, like Nietzche's Priest, to supplant Majority beliefs with their own Minority beliefs and then require the govt to enforce them in equally oppressive fashion. History will generally show that the laws tend to become even more restrictive after such a cry for &quot;freedom&quot; from &quot;oppression&quot; is heard.<br>
<br>
The bottom line here is that we have become a society which caters desperately to anyone with enough of a lack of self-esteem to claim &quot;victim&quot; status. This Nudrow (sp?) wacko has finally found himself a path by which to assault the Right/Conservative side. He sought to assault it via various lawsuits before, none of which got anywhere. Thus he chooses something so intransically American as the Pledge to assault and finally gets the attention he so desperately craves. Pathetic. Equally pathetic as the craven minority &quot;victims&quot; that seek to become the Oppressors.<br>
<br>
So, in all, the decision was right, the motivation was wrong. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>
