I booted Rain out of VoR when he petitioned against us on a loot issue.  We had just killed a mob that dropped a melee item.  We had two other melee there that needed the item and he wanted to roll.  When asked why he wanted to roll, he said he wanted the item for his girlfriends twink, which by the way wasn't in VoR.  We explained need before greed and denied him the roll.  AFTER I logged off, he petitioned against VoR claiming that our ways of doing loot wasn't fair.  When I logged back on and talked with him, he kept telling me it wasn't fair and that he should have been able to roll for his girlfriends twink.  I booted him after that.<br>
<br>
Dude, the only beef you have with me is because I will not allow loot whores into my guild.  After seeing these post and reading your post on other guilds boards, no self respecting guildleader would allow you in.  <br>

If you would just stop to look at your problems with everyone you might just find that YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.  <br>
<br>
When you interact with people on the scale that you do in EQ, you are going to come into contact with many types of individuals.  When you find yourself, as you have, with many of those individuals sharing a common dislike of you, it is totally wild of you to assume that EVERYONE OTHER THAN YOU IS AT FAULT.<br>
<br>
Try looking at yourself in a mirror, Rainwynds.  You may just not like what you see.<br>

Rainwynds was in At Death's Door for awhile, can't remember why he left.  Then he tried to get into Simurgh Re`em (which morphed into Fifth Eclipse) and when his name was brought up in guild, like 15 people had negative comments, so he was rejected.<br>

<br>
If my account is ever hacked, and all my toons deleted, it will upset me, sure.  I have over 18 months invested in my account, untold hundreds of hours of play time spent helping others, levelling, raiding and questing.  I have spent more hours than I can count helping perfect strangers with quests, finding NPC's, Epics or just something as simple as a CR.<br>
<br>
I have accumulated a lot of things, but the things I value most of all are the friendships that I have made.  People like Auggust and Cenydd, acquaintances like Sephrok, Bulvai, Montyy, Quasqueton, and others too numerous to mention.  With friends like these, all the loot, plat and items are just candy added to it.  With friends and acquaintances such as these, if my account was ever hacked, I know that I would be able to start all over again without even breaking a sweat.<br>
<br>
You have to be the most bitter person I have ever encountered in this game.  Quellious will be a better place without you.  I hope you can find happiness elsewhere, cause you sure are not happy here.<br>
