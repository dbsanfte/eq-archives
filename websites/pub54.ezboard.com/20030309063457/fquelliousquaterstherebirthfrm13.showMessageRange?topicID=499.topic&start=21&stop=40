<br>
No Im not talking about exp groups here, Im talking about raids.. Yes I had AAXP, Mipp is a &quot;veteran&quot; with nd3 and over 4200hps.<br>
<br>
Clerics whined, bitched, moaned all their lives.  While they are the ONLY class that is 100% needed. <br>
<br>
&quot;And Mipp, I can tell you are completely ignorant of the tribulations of being stuck in the CH rut so I won't bother to respond to your mocking clerics getting bored.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry, like most MTs of guild I usually had to play my own cleric as well. since well they were all too bored to show up.<br>
<br>
If you strive on stress its a class for you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<br>
But my point, and you basically proved it <br>
<br>
&quot;Clerics can solo 3 primary ways.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wars are so one sided.. THAT was boring.. you had 1 method to kill something solo.. hope you get in more damage then the mob does to you..<br>
<br>
<br>
Ever played a 60 druid?? I could not even keep Mipp healed against mobs in howling stones with a druid.. Because of CLERIC ranting and being so afraid that they will not be the &quot;MOST NEEDED&quot; druids BLOW for healing.  Tired of your CH rut? stop bitching about other classes getting better heals and perhaps your role will change. <br>
<br>
<br>
  Lovely quotes from clerics on their board when druid 75% heal (which is nowhere NEAR  75% to me) and that crappy shaman heal were things like &quot;Hope they like pally rezzes cause this goes live Ill delete my cleric&quot;.<br>
<br>
THAT is why you all got hammers of uber damage, because you whined and complained and look what druids and shamans got? NOTHING.. Look what clerics got? turned into paladins with cleric spells....<br>
<br>
  Guilds, just like VI have been catering to clerics far too long. The entire raid game revolves around them. Give druids and shamans the spells they need to compliment or in my angry world replace them. <br>

<br>
Salubre, obviously you play your cleric for different reasons than I do, and have become sick of meleeing with Sachem or something.<br>
<br>
<br>
   Back in 1999 I opened my EQ box and created a warrior, because it was listed as a class of easy difficulty.  I named him Snarglebargle, and after falling off kelethin a few times and getting murdered by orcs while trying to find my brother in felwithe I gave up and created Elsa.<br>
<br>
   I was to be a cleric, a class of moderate difficulty.  I would be a crappy version of a warrior who could cast spells and heal!!!!  ok /cough that didnt happen, I finally realized I had to be main healer when i was about level 19.  After this I was never able to stand back up again until my late 50's about a year and a half later.  <br>
<br>
After all teh nifty buffs like clarity 2 and bard song c2 I started to stand up again and beat on stuff.  I was then  the Battle Cleric of Death!  And still to this day I fight by whatever means I can and try to maximize my damage output grouping or soloing.<br>
<br>
These days I am certainly not using my mana for healing very often in most experience zones.  So i nuke and beat on stuff as much as I can.  And I do awful damage compared to a lvl 2 gnome bard!!<br>
<br>
And no Mipp, clerics do not have 100 spells to choose from for things to do.  Our spells are quite basic in use, and most are pretty damn useless.  Ask Sachem!  i am sure she can provide a rundown of useful utility spells that actually do something besides heal and buff.<br>
<br>
i dont really mind having most of my abilities totally gimped just becasue I can CH and rez for 6% more than a paladin.  Hmm come to think of it, if you want to play this class envy game..  So what spells does a Paladin not get that a cleric does besides larger heals and the best version of the Aegolism buff line?<br>
<br>
I really don't care what they get.  I have lived though a LOT of caster balancing, enough to see that very little has been done to adjust clerics besides giving them bigger heals and buffs.  I remeber a LOT of melee/hybrid balancing that occured numerous times that greatly improved the powers of many underpowered classes.<br>
<br>
Cleric have recieved attention as well, but most things given have been taken away.<br>
<br>
i am sure everyone knows what they are hehe..<br>
<br>
Broken record goes as follows:<br>
<br>
Mark of Karn = overpowered = nerfed to uselessness<br>
<br>
Donals Chestplate Effect = overpowered = nerfed<br>
<br>
Velious CE Effect= overpowered = nerfed to Mark of Karn!! oh wow 9 sec DS removal spell!<br>
<br>
Hammer of Death = overpowered = nerfed to a &quot;toy&quot;<br>
<br>
Hammer Pet = crap for 2 years = fixed! = still crap<br>
<br>
Some of that stuff I can care less about, or had not gotten til after it had been nerfed.  Sure Clerics have gotten some nice heal upgrades we dont need in every day life at all, and sure we have recieved some nice spells like Mark of Karn, but nothing ever so fantastic as that hammer.<br>
<br>
That hammer gave me some more options.  It gave me a lot of fun, and a reason to want to dust off a character which I had invested 3 years into yet had left for dead, mostly due to utter boredom.  <br>
<br>
Clerics are an extremely one dimensional class, and that being said I can sympathize with warriors, who have a limited purpose, and a very important job to do just as a cleric does.  But why cant you just be happy for clerics for finding joy in playing again, in a new ability that doesnt outbalance us anymore than a fungi tunic outbalances a melee?<br>
<br>
I parsed my logs of nerfage and post nerfage today on Shissar Thingies in the grey.  Prepatch I was doing 27-34 DPS on average, 75% of that coming from the weapons proc, 15 point reverse damage shield, and ring Nine 8 pt DS; while 25% came from my actual melee damage including bash.<br>
After nerfage I got a 50/50 result.  50% coming from those damage sheilds and procs, the other 50% from melee damage.  i clocked in at about a Maximum of 24 DPS, averaging about 20 DPS in melee, procs, and damage shields.<br>
<br>
Please someone tell me how that is so amazing?  How the hell does that infringe upon a Paladin or any other Melee?  My understanding is that your average Melee is doing a lot more damage than that...<br>
<br>
Fyi I have crit2 which effects the weapons proc, FT9 +6botr+MC1, and was swapping in primal at the end of every fight to reproc avatar to get 250 str and 255 dex with 1071 attack.  oh yeah and im level 60..  so oh boy amazing...<br>
<br>
but that was better than anything I had before that point =) and it was fun as fuck!<br>

Groups can become more dynamic and versatile depending on what classes are available. Also, check the attack level on any cleric, and I bet its not very high. Unless Yaulp V boosts that up a couple hundred points, clerics can't hit all that often, 40% if they are lucky. The only problem that this is causing is keeping the clerics from meleeing when they are low on mana. I think that issue will die down when the novelty wears off. <br>
<br>
I was in UP today and we had 2 shaman, an enchanter, a druid, cleric and a monk. Normally we couldn't pull off named mobs and live. We even had adds and didn't have to zone (not all were able to be mezzed). I doubt in raid situations that clerics will be in there meleeing, and group makeup will determine whether they can in exp groups. <br>
<br>
Melees will never be replaced. We NEED you guys. With our help as healers and buffers, we form a team that can accomplish a lot together. I am intriqued by the class tweaks and we shouldn't feel threatened. Of course my main is not a melee, but I find it nice we don't have to rely on you all or the wizards to do most of the damage. Now we can all be equally valuable. <br>
<br>
It seems though that increasing the power of a melee is in the gear, and I hope that they continue the class tweaks to include straight meleers before PoP, I have a feeling you will need it. <p><table border=0>

Well over 150 total. Do I have a problem with clerics ? maybe.. Do I have a problem with clerics causing other classes to be not upgraded for years.. YES. <br>
<br>
Eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums go read it sometime.. read the threads from 3 years ago to now.. <br>
<br>
I also started in 1999, I have played paladin, shaman, warrior, shadow knight, wizard , necro, monk, rogue .. and 2 boxed druids, chanters, clerics.<br>
<br>
My first character took 26 days to get to level 27! My second character was a shaman.. Now that was a class that was a blast to play!! I reverse kited with him LONG before kunark, long before snare and fear were on items.. Heres a hint - you get blind at lvl 1 as a cleric!!!<br>
<br>
A clerics spellbook contains some GREAT utility spells, Blind , lulls, roots, fears, a decent nuke and a VERY damaging pet for a non pet class. I really do not believe that clerics are as one dimensional as you clerics want to claim, use some innovation and see what you can do!<br>
<br>
Druids are getting the shaft BIG time here, in my opinion two druids should equal one cleric. How many to equal one now? 2? 4? 6? 8?<br>
<br>
<br>
Ever try the evil city guards in echo caverns? with full warlords/ss and my epic with dragon haste I could keep 3 dead .. I came back the next day to see a ranger meleeing full spawn to death, came back the next day to see a cleric clearing the entire place.. next day the same.. next day the same. This was long before yesterdays patch.<br>
<br>
I quaded with wizard, I was able to get more exp with him solo in 2 hours then it took my warrior grouped in UD or US 4 nights of ~6-8 hour nights.<br>
<br>
I was able to kill 3-7 mobs in skyfire using no more then 100 mana per mob .. and kill them all simultaniously..<br>
<br>
I was able to solo spiders in velks at 1 per 7 mins IF I could find them up with mipp..<br>
<br>
AAXP is HUGELY biased towards casters, and clerics sir - are casters. I am not saying that clerics can get exp as fast as wizard or warrior, but all casting classes have options and tactics whether it be root dotting with epics, quad kiting or other innovations that a warrior simply does not have. <br>
<br>
So you have regen mana at 16 a tic standing not counting innate? isnt that over a ch every 2.5 mins so effectively if you find a blue you can melee in 2.5 mins you are effectively fm after every fight? I guess pet costs 250 more so add in a bit of time?<br>

I dont feel any class should have it both ways to the extent of being powerful in both areas. <br>
A cleric being able to melee(with procs) the way I did the other night and still being able to heal (even better with the new spells) was unfair, and im glad they changed it.<br>

I love healing and I love buffing, I made a group dependant class on purpose and have never been sorry for it, frustrated yes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but never sorry.<br>

I just wanted to say a few things about what Elsatia Diotallevi was said.<br>
<br>
From what i recall, the main classes to be upgraded were Rogues (yeah they used to suck), Monks, Rangers, Paladins, and Shadowknights. what did the Warrior's get, those weak little damage bonuses on the weapons. Oh wait all melee/hybrids got those right? So that means us warrior's are still as weak as we were. yeah we can tank the best sence we have alot of HP's and an AC bonus, but what good is that if all the clerics whine about CHing us?  (correct me if i'm wrong here)<br>
<br>
Also i wanted to say, FINALLY. i've been waiting for the day druids get shafted for over a year now. my reasons are my own. i don't dislike all druids, i mean they are a great class, but they were way overplayed and overpowered. <br>

<br>
Do I agree with the cleric upgrades ? yes I do .. it gives them a FURTHER viable option for soloing.  <br>
<br>
Do I think that clerics are right to say clerics are/were the worst solo'ing class ? <br>
<br>
Hell no, they never have been.  Although possibly between 25-42 ish they were a bit dodgy.  <br>
<br>
I dont think clerics have been given that much of an upgrade in the past, so this is a welcomed upgrade.  Not that it will really matter in groups, they will still perform the same function....<br>
<br>
And to the above poster who mentioned rez, DA etc....DA is a pure 100% defensive skill and it is not used soloing at all.  If you are soloing and use DA (unless you intend to run with SoW on) its useless.   Your better off rooting stepping back, healing yourself .... or gating whichever.  <br>
<br>
And a lot of the focus in this thread has been put on raids - clerics role will not change as far as raids are concerned. <br>
<br>
In general grouping situations, it dosent really change either - I for one will still have 3 stuns up, I will still have 3 heals up and 2 DAs.<br>

I never got how clerics can be so upset playing one when basically you have one of the most important roles there is and one of the most loved classes.<br>

Ok so not all spells, but kind of shows you the comparison. Fact is we arent even close to the percentage of cleric we are supposed to be OR percentage of warrior we should be. You play a cleric to keep groups/ single tanks alive...that is pretty much your role. Sure you can get melee, but not what that patch gave you off a store bought spell.<br>

<br>
At the same time, Verant has designed it so that ridiculous proportions of clerics are needed for raids.  This is a design FLAW, not a gift.<br>
<br>
CH monkeys are destined to burn out with the state of cleric class today.  That's why recruitment is always open and clerics go in and out the raiding guild revolving door.<br>
<br>
You don't have to be in a tier 1 guild to see cleric burnout, either.<br>
<br>
Raiding clerics are all work and no play.  The kicker is that most of these raiding clerics aren't good for much else.  Many are so tired and frustrated after raiding they don't bother to consider exping.<br>
<br>
It's not true in all cases but its a &quot;class trait&quot; moreso than any other.<br>
<br>
The real upgrade clerics needed was to reduce that burnout curve that is inherent in the design.  Alleviate as much stress and pressure on clerics in the raid scene as possible and compensate them with something FUN to do in their free time.<br>
<br>
And everyone saw clerics having fun and screamed NERF!  What are you thinking?  Do you WANT burned out clerics that the game is STILL designed on you having to rely on?  That's burning YOUR bridges, buddy.<br>
<br>
I can only shake my head.<br>
<br>
And STOP this crap about &quot;I feel so oppressed cuz you're getting YOUR issues fixed.&quot;  It's like you basically expect any decent-minded cleric to stand up indignantly at these changes and say &quot;I cannot accept this!  Fix &lt;insert class here&gt; first!&quot;  You're like a child, a sibling, who can't stand it when his better half gets a lollipop and you don't.  Bleh.<br>
<br>
Then you blow up at him for having the lollipop only to find out mommy had one in her pocket for you.  Then you sit there licking YOUR new lollipop and your brother hates you.  A little patience would have gone a long way in this case.<br>
<br>
That nerf was bad for the health of raiding guilds all over.<br>

ya that was my issue too. i mean if verant wants to weave in more power to cleric with uber mob rare drops.  cool.  thats one thing to consider<br>
<br>
giving every cleric the same exact powerful increase gives no bonus to a cleric *playing the game*.  it just doesnt fit.  if i see an LC cleric meleeing what weapon would that cleric be using? the same exact one a cleric that just dinged 56 in his mostly level 45 guild is using.  What is right bout that?<br>

Instead of considering the spell be moved to 60 and made a high level mob drop, Verant simply responded to the backlash cry for it to be nerfed into oblivion in its effectiveness.<br>
<br>
I agree.  I think 56 clerics have no business with this spell!  If Verant didn't want to move it to 60 they should have scaled the proc rate/proc damage from 56-60, only being as powerful as it was pre-nerf to a level 60.<br>
<br>
They also had plenty of time during testing to consider making it a Class AA skill to be earned and purchased with sweat and blood, instead of 5pp.  Did they consider this?  Apparently not.  This lack of creativity continually makes me sick.<br>

<br>
You need more clerics per raid than any other class period.  Once the raid is over and you have 8 clerics for your 50 person raid force to exp what are all the rest of the clerics supposed to do?  Groups would rather get another melee than a second cleric since adding a second cleric doesn't efficiently help them kill any faster.  Clerics didn't 'stack' well in groups.  So in my opinion you need to give them some sort of alternative.<br>
<br>
And Mipp to be complaining about casters exping in general is pretty weak.  For some reason or another you're completely forgetting the rangers/pallies/sks/wars/monks who have gotten hundreds of aa points SOLOing in FG.  These same melee chars chose to solo rather than grouping with a cleric or other healer because it was less efficient exp-wise for them.  Now that clerics can solo and have a chance to accomplish the same thing everyone else did solo it needs to be nerfed.  You're also comparing your experience in a crowded velks zone to people who are pulling easier mobs of the same level nonstop in FG.  Of course a wizzy quadding is gonna make more experience in a wide open less crowded zone than you are in a crowded zone like velks.  Of course a cleric soloing somewhere outside of velks with more spawns to kill is going to get okay exp.  You're comparing apples to oranges... put yourself in the same situation and then test out this horrible exp you claim to be getting.<br>
<br>
I won't even talk about how unbalancing some procs on weapons are.  You're telling me clerics have all these spells that they can use to solo really well (not minding the fact you still only have 8 spell slots) when you have the following abilities just by equipping a weapon/item:<br>
<br>
slow<br>
root<br>
fear<br>
steelskin<br>
avatar<br>
arch shielding<br>
tash<br>
snare<br>
<br>
Dont' even mind all the 100+ dd procs and dots there are on weapons, too many of those to even mention.  You basically have lower level versions of everything a chanter can do... slow, root, a rune, arch shielding, tash, etc.  <br>
<br>
I'm sorry you feel so done in by this patch Mipp.  I just want to know why you didn't bother using one of those clerics you had to 2box when all the rest of your guild's clerics were &quot;too bored to come raid&quot; to rez your twinks.<br>

<br>
Clerics are THE class in this game, the number of clerics in a guild directly correspond to what that guild can accomplish.<br>

You are correct, two clerics in an exp group means about the same as two warriors on a raid.<br>

<br>
As far as warriors soloing...well I don't having anything that would be considered uber.  I have no Vellious quest armor.  No really cool weapons.  And I can solo.   I know your gonna say &quot;Yah but you 2box a shaman&quot;.  Yes I do.  You had the option to 2box numerous clerics also.  You could have soloed as well or better than I can.  And even without the shaman I can still solo a lot of stuff.  <br>
<br>
As far as clerics...Every single one of you that every for one second says that clerics are Verrants child class needs to take some of those fuckin memory drugs.  Clerics haven't gotten shit in SOOO long while almost every other class (with the exception of warriors) has gotten some upgrades here and there.  Now yes I think Druids and Shamans need some work too.  Oh and playing someone elses cleric on raids is not the same thing as playing a cleric for 1-60.  Do that get around 35 or so AA points because you HAVE TO HAVE MGB! and then see how interested you are in playing a cleric anymore.  I can't tell you how many patches I sat their reading wishing there was something in there for me as a cleric and most times all I saw was nerfing.  I don't fucking care if it's overpowering.  The bottom line is this is a game and games are supposed to be fun.  If Verrant puts something in the game that makes it more fun for a bunch of people then I say KICK ASS and fuck anyone else that wants to bitch and cry and moan cause little brother got a lolipop.  <br>

They were quite similiar to what a paladin is now in EQ only they used blunt weapons.  They were holy warriors.  The notion that a cleric is a heal bitch is something that is inherant only to EQ.  I never liked it much.  I used to play a cleric in D&amp;D and I thought I was getting much the same thing with my EQ cleric at first...unfortunately I was vastly decieved.   <p>Gimily Smashfist 60th Cleric (retired)<BR>Gimilly Smashfist 59th Warrior</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ushunyaatma.showPublicProfile?language=EN>shunyaatma</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/6/02 10:03:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=499.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IMO...</span><hr size=1> Not that its particularly pertinent to this thread, but two warriors on a raid &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 clerics in an exp group.
