Mostly the Brits.  I meant no disrespect to the efforts you made against the forces of evil during the last 100 years.  I wasn't saying you didn't give it your all.  You certainly did.   (Those cheese-eating surrender-monkey French, however, are still on my &quot;no rez&quot; list. )  But without such events such as the US supplying destroyers and smaller fast warships (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq59-23.htm)">www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq59-23.htm)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> to protect the sealanes supplying Britain with supplies, y'all were awfully close to going under.  Stopping the German Operation Sea Lion was crucial to your immediate survival but that did not guarantee your long-term one - those U-boats were wrecking the shipping lanes.  <br>
<br>
I was merely commenting on the fact that *criticism* of what America is doing against the forces of terrorism should be curbed.  I'm not saying that there is no torture going on. Hell, I hope there is.  I'm just commenting on the fact that the REST of the world should STFU and STFD because *no one* out there is innocent.  Britain has their Bloody Sunday and we have our own little dark secrets.  If our pundits criticized *your* government when that thing went down in Ireland, well they should have stopped poking their nose in your business and STFU and STFD too. <br>
<br>
Woo, regardless of whether or not Europe waited for the &quot;American supermen to save them&quot;, the fact remains that without American support, the odds were better than good that Germany would have eventually isolated and destroyed Great Britain.  There was no one else left to help them. <br>
<br>
Now, onto the folks who are drawing the Afghan people into this conversation.  Stop it.  I'm sure than most of the populace of that country were not aware what was going on.  Lots of them are definitely suffering for no good reason and that just plain sucks.  I'm talking about the folks who have declared a jihad on the Americans and our way of life.  I'm talking about those who raised weapons to our troops and our civilians.  They are the ones who need a little tune up with a switch out behind the woodshed.  And if that happens to break a few of the Geneva Convention codes... Good.  F*ck'em.  They gave up that right when they failed to hand over the terrorists and their supporters.  We made it painfully clear to their political leaders for a long time that we wanted the folks who did the dirty deed on Sept 11.  &quot;You want to harbor terrorists and support their way of life?  Fine.  That's your choice.  But don't send Mr Bush sad f*cking emails when a GBU Mk84 bomb sails through the window of your dirty clay hovel.  He doesn't wanna hear it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, Amnesty International does some very good deeds and some honest work.  But by the same token, they have to acknowledge that these are not the best years of our lives.  Extreme measures might be less the exception and more of the rule until we get a little bit more world order and teamwork on the global gridiron.  It's not the right time to start criticizing how the U.S. treat the prisoners who just a couple of months ago revolted while under more leniant prison rules and ended up killing many of their captors before being killed themselves. (Yes, you remember that event.)  The prisoners are extremists and will probably stop at nothing to harm their enemies. Thus the stricter policies.  &quot;Fool me once...&quot; I say.<br>
<br>
Laur, I'm not sure if your metaphor really depicts the spirit of my original post but I'll respond anyway. (Doesn't that broken glass-encrusted dildo now drop in Maiden's Eye? )  I was only referring to the prisoners-of-war being held in Gitmo and the folks criticizing (actually ostrasizing) our methods of detention.  I'm sure we aren't collecting all of the Afghan peoples and interring them.  We're just grabbing the folks who are firing heavy-calibre weapons at our troops and biting our guards.  Justifiable force I believe is the term best used to describe what's happening here.  (BTW.. your end-quote, from the Bible, is more recognized as SLJ's vocal prequel to his assassination of people in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  Not quite the most appropriate closing to your &quot;don't hurt the innocent&quot; diatribe.   But I digress...) <br>
<br>
Mieranna, thanks!  You're eyes are sharp!!<br>
<br>
Aspro, Hell, no.  America is not populated by virgins.  We're not saints.  I know that.  I'm no saint either.  But we did and still do help a LOTTA folks around the world and get very little if anything in return.  All I'm saying is... if you were starving and someone gave you free food when no one else would, shouldn't that person be one of the LAST on your list of &quot;people to @#%$ upon today&quot;?  If you're not perfect, then you shouldn't be squawking about the next guy.  'Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Shag, you're balls-on right.  It would have taken a LOT longer and the Germans screwed the pooch by attacking Russia. BUT there's a difference between having air superiority over Great Britain and having air superiority over your trade routes.  Hint: Think oil and rubber.  Anything coming around the horn of Africa or through the Meditteranean was at the mercy of the German navy.  Stick a few pocket battleships in the English shipping lanes with their 11&quot; guns and you'll see how willing merchant ship captains were willing to set sail at a blindingly fast pace of 8 or 9 knots.  No, England was not going to suffer defeat from the invasion of their land from the coast of France but that doesn't mean that they were well-to-do on their own either.  We'll never know because that's a &quot;what-if&quot; scenario - - but if you run the numbers and make even the safest assumptions, it didn't look good for England circa mid-1941.  And it wasn't getting any brighter.  And that line about the &quot;chest of tea and Hollywood&quot;... ahahahha.. THAT was good.  /hat's off.<br>
<br>
Zyon, no offense but... screw the UN.  They are a bunch of posturing, hollow blowhards who wrap themselves in their own political agendas and celebrity.   I've seen their ability to help world order (NOT!).  And I am rather unimpressed with their ability to simply be common citizens of the City (NYC that is), nevermind model citizens of the world.  If the fanatics who drove the planes into the WTC instead decided to veer 20 degrees to port and instead drive their planes into the UN Building (which, btw, is 1 block away from me) you would have seen a MUCH different reaction from the world-at-large.  You would have seen many governments come down on the Taliban like a bunch of 10-pound sledgehammers.  It's easy to play the critic when someone else is actually doing the work.   And I vote that we screw &quot;the world's ire&quot;.  Wanna see ire?  Go talk to someone who went to 6 funerals for dear friends.  In 4 days. That's ire.  Wanna see anger?  Let that person loose in that prison in Cuba.  Those prisoners in Gitmo should be THANKFUL they aren't being held in Riker's Island... they'd end up as blood clots splattered against the walls.  They want to be martyrs?  There are about 9 million people in NYC willing to help them achieve their goals.<br>

Good point by Cyl about the Government of Afghanistan being the problem, not the people.  In the USA, many people don't realize (are ignorant of) the fact that much of the world's population doesn't enjoy the same freedoms, liberties, and creature comforts that we American's take for granted every day.  Most people in the USA take a shower in and flush more clean water down the toilet than much of the world's population sees in a day, or a week.  I've been places like that.  <br>
<br>
The average Afghani isn't in a position to protest Jack.  Here in the US, if I don't like something the government does, I can walk down the street shouting or carrying a sign in protest.  In many third-world countries, a citizen would be dead within 5 minutes if they tried that.  <br>
<br>
However, those people going into the stockade aren't just Afghani citizens, they are people who fought for the Taliban or Al-Qaida. Now they are essentially in jail, awaiting a hearing.  I don't think that's outside the bounds of human rights.  Of all the places we could have put them, by themselves is about the safest.  <br>
<br>
As for Human Rights, while I won't claim the USA invented the concept, we did put it in our Declaration of Independence, and it was a pretty damned radical idea then that People have rights that are God granted, not government (king) granted.  What a concept!  If the rights aren't granted by the government, they cannot be taken away by the government in a just society.  (Ok, I don't want to get into due process, etc.  )  I'm all for Human Rights advocates as long as they don't go crying wolf.  <br>
<br>
As for the media, oh yes the media is liberally biased, and yes, a surprisingly large percentage of the media is influenced by Jewish people.  Certainly they have an agenda, but they aren't making it all up either.  As for Israel and land, much of Israel's expansion since 1948 has been in wars that they didn't even start!  Jerusalem was won as part of the six-day war, which was a surprise attack launched against Israel.  And they take darned good care of the land they own.  In an area where there were fewer than 15,000 trees when they arrived in 1948, there are now over 3,000,000 trees.  They also have given some land back.  I haven't seen anything to support that Israel's Law or Return is causing internal population pressures to aquire land.  Most of their current fighting is reactionary.   <br>
<br>
After having traveled to several other countries, some third-world, I can understand how they could see America as a fount of decadence.  We do live in the land of plenty.  However, I have seen so many people in small, poor countries, who see America as the land of plenty, and a wonderful thing to strive for.  Thankfully, while some of the world hates us, it tends to be due either to jealousy, or a fear that if we gain influence, we will help educate the populace, and an educated people are not easily controlled.  Why did Mao Tze Tung kill off all of the intellectuals and scholars?  Because they would be the ones able to debate the &quot;truths&quot; of communism.  Ignorant people will believe almost anything said with enough authority.  <br>

<br>
Did I at any point say we should murder or treat <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Afghani poorly? No.  All I said was I know who my enemies are and they are the people who knowingly harbored the terrorists that killed 3000 of my people.  Did your average Joe in Afghanistan willingly decide to stuff bin Laden in his cave? Probably not.  Therefore I have no personal hatred towards the average Joe.  As a matter of fact, I feel terrible for Afghani women for being forced to pretty much wrapped themselves up like a burrito to the point where they can't even see to cross the street and often get run over with no remorse.  I am by far the bigot against all Afghani you'd like to perceive me to be.<br>
<br>
I'll say it again incase you missed it the first time.  I know who my enemies are.  They are the people who knowingly harbored terrorists that masterminded a plan that killed 3000 of my people.  If your average Afghani Abdul didn't play a role in it, I have no reason to hate him.  However, do keep in mind that plenty of Afghani were shown cheering in the streets of Kabul and burning the American flag when they heard that we got attacked and numerous people died.  Even children.  Is that any way to raise your children?  Condone cheering when their country mercilessly attacks another?  They were driving around in their Ford trucks (American made might I add) cheering as if it was a Cinco de Mayo celebration!<br>
<br>
As for rights, I never once condoned the mistreating of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I merely asked about the rights of all those innocent lives that were lost on Sept 11.  Who gave bin Laden and his goons the right to violate those victims' rights?  <br>
<br>
Take your preachings to the Afghani who has repeatedly attacked my homeland.  Have them take a look in global fact books.  Tell them about OUR rights.  I never intended to argue with you, however, when there are so many families who've lost loved ones on Sept 11, their rights takes precedence.  <br>
<br>
I will never understand how people can think that even though we get a attacked repeatedly, to the point where 3000+ lives were lost, and landmarks, which has been around for decades, has been reduced to ruins, and it'll all be ok if we just sit by the campfire, holding hands and sing Kumbaya. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ubulvaihammersson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BulvaiHammersson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/23/02 10:37:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really steams my clams (off EQ-topic)</span><hr size=1> Hi all. I found these two pennies and decided to toss em in...<br>
<br>
WWII, whew, what a pear-shaped mess that was. Let's clear a few things up. The USA does not win wars by superior tactics. The USA does not win wars by superior equipment. The USA does not win wars by the superior quality of its' troops. The USA wins wars by logistics. Iknow, I know, it's not exciting, sexy, to think about winning wars by logistics, but it's how we do it. We over-supply everything as much as possible. The units in the field are always under-supplied, but it beats no supplies at all. While we're at it, we positively bury our allies in supplies. Before the US involvement in WWII in the European theatre, how much tonnage did we dump on the fine shores of our favorite ally, Britain? (and I say that with zero sarcasm, we love the UK here) How much tonnage did we ship and drop to France? We paid our dues good and heavy pre-war, and then backed em up later in the field (much like WWI, but that's another, uglier, story).<br>
<br>
But I digress. Look at things objectively, kids. If the US had never set foot in Europe in WWII, Britain would NOT have been rolled over. I doubt any German soldiers would've even set foot on British soil in any significant way. France would not have stayed a puppet of Germany. Alsaice-Lorraine would likely be speaking even more Deutsch than it already does, but that is as things are. Poland would've eventually been retaken by the Soviets (they did every few decades anyway). Things would be different, yes, but wildly different? Not in my opinion. <br>
<br>
The US's involvement primarily allowed for two things. First, it made the war end sooner than it likely would have. Second, it meant the total defeat of Germany, instead of Armistice. History repeats itself though, as US involvement in WWI is what upset the balance of power in Europe and lead (with a LOT of help by idiotic French diplomats enforcing truly UN-F*CKING-BELIEVABLE reparations demands on Germany) directly to WWII. I rather doubt that WWII would've occurred without our sticking our nose into what should've been a purely local affair simply because the post-WWI negotiations destroyed German self-rule, set up a power vacuum that gave Hitler an eventual opening, AND ravaged the German economy into hideous depression through the flames of war reparation demanded most heavily by the French.<br>
<br>
So, in the long run, we save no country's bacon in WWII. We did save an awful lot of good young men from dying early and saved some innocent people (not just Jews, but homosexuals, idssenters, and other undesirables) from an unspeakable existence and death at the hands of limited elements of the SS.<br>
<br>
As far as treatment of prisoners goes, you may not believe it, but we will be more humane to those sh*tbags than we would even to our own people, in similar circumstances, simply because we really do believe in fair and equal treatment under law. Certain things have changed in the security measures in transport, but it is simply because these are the type of people who would gladly die to kill their captors. Silly us for being extra strict to prevent that.<br>
<br>
War? It happens. Get over it. You have war to thank for 80% of the technological advances you are so used to living with today. War, the greatest level of human conflict, also inpres the greatest level of human endeavour and creativity. It's a fact of life. That endeavour and creativity is pure though, as the people producing the marvelous technical advancements for war are doing it so the war will end sooner and less people will die. High-tech weapons, contrary to what you might think, save more lives than they take.<br>

I didn't meant to say US didn't help in WWII at all.  I was trying to point out that US didn't do it alone.  US couldn't have won the war alone without the help from some other countries too.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you're not perfect, then you shouldn't be squawking about the next guy. 'Nuff said.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since nobody is perfect...guess everyone in the world should just mind their own business.  So...why do we have to keep sticking our nose to every single event in the world?  I don't think US is perfect in anyway.  If I remember correctly, US is, and has been one of the most out spoken country about human right--even prisoners.  How many time in the past US has help accuss other country of their way of treating their prisoners? I can't even count.  Rules are all good until others apply to us...and we say shamlessly, proudly---THEY STARTED IT FIRST THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE NO RIGHT.  O..also--WE HELPED YOU LONG LONG LONG LONG TIME AGO SO YOU SHOULD JUST STFU AND WATCH US BREAK THE RULES THAT WE FORCE OTHER PPL TO FOLLOW.  That doesnt sound convining to me.<br>
<br>
And Bush, i still can't believe he made some of his statements.  he said something like...you are either with us or with them. if you are not with us, you are with them.--can other country NOT with either side? afterall, it's none of their business at all.   That statement made me mad, made US look like a bully--not that we didnt look like one to a lot of countries before, but this just make it worst.  Afterall, we were trying to ask for helps from other countries.<br>
<br>
Afghan people....if everyone tells you the sky is black since you are born, you would think the sky is black too. That's how I look at them.  Blame the leader, not the ppl, not even the soldiers.  I dont think a soldier get much choice when a order is given--or he wouldn't be a soldier at all, he would be just another dead corpse.  <br>
<br>
&quot;But we did and still do help a LOTTA folks around the world and get very little if anything in return.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trust me, we get more than our share in return.  By helping other ppl in the world, by war, by supplying them stuff (whatever it is)--we helped our OWN economy (make you wonder why CA's econ increase whenever there's a war? =P). we raised our image to other countries. we get a lot of 'free passes' from other countries.<br>
<br>
This whole thing...i was mad and sad when NYC got attacked.  But after seeing how US deal with it and seeing how US ppl react, I am not so sure about it anymore.  Afghan terrorism kill US ppl. US soldiers kill Afghan ppl.  Afghan ppl cheered when US ppl get killed/attacked.  US people cheered when Afghan ppl get killed/attacked.  Finger pointing flying everywhere.  We are basically doing the same thing as them, and the best excuse we come up with is: THEY STARTED IT FIRST. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugurunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurunt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/24/02 3:20:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bleeding Heart Liberal &lt;--- Someone Call a Cleric</span><hr size=1> <br>
The reason behind &quot;with us or against us&quot; is.. terrorists don't have borders.  If we're being attacked by terrorists from a country that won't help stopping them, we have a right to stop them ourselves.  See Afganistan. <br>
<br>
Otherwise, we could do ANYTHING and have no responsibility, train a fighter pilot, and sell him his own nuclear equipped bomber for a dollar, let him nuke some country we don't like, return home, and go &quot;The US didn't bomb you, BOB bombed you.  It was BOB, not us... he's not a soldier and he wasn't using our plane, it was HIS.   Bob is in Denver with his family, no, we won't extradite, nor commandeer his plane.  I don't know if he has any more nukes, but if you try and mess with him, remember he's a US citizen and we won't take kindly to that&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you kept up with the events you would also know Bush has said (paraphrased) &quot;I don't expect all of our allies to contribute equally&quot;.  It's not an issue of 'you must fight with us or we will kill you'.... it's a matter of 'if you are not doing what you can in your own region to be terrorist free, you are risking the US clearing out your terrorist problem for you'<br>
<br>
I'm anti war, pro peace; but I'm fully behind our actions against the terrorists and the Taliban.  I don't *want* to be at war, I don't even want the terrorists killed.  I want the WTC back, the thousands of dead back, or at LEAST steps taken as necessary to minimize the risk of an equivalent or worse event.  Can't have what was taken back, and the ONLY way to decrease the chance of another attack is to remove those that would do it.  We tried talking, and sanctions, and every other recourse.. this didn't start on 9/11, they've been killing us overseas and bombing our military for a decade.  When we let them kill hundreds of people with no consequence, it only makes SENSE for them to kill thousands... what are we supposed to expect if we let them kill thousands with no consequence?<br>
<br>
I don't believe in the only-victims mentality that seems to be prevalent in the peace activists seem to have.  If Daku punches me in the nose, I'm a victim.   The fact I was attemptign to rape his mother at the time is irrelevant, he hit me and I'm being hurt and mistreated!<br>

I wonder what people  feel about having police at all, or any kind of jucicial system/penal system, as MILLIONS of folks are currently incarcerated, their freedoms revoked, unable to live the lives they want.

Even if we captured Osama Bin Laden himself, no matter how much we may want to drive hot nails through his eyelids, we are in a country that recognizes that human beings have a right to not be treated with cruel or unusual punishment. After reading that article, I really can't say whether those prisoners are getting humane treatment or not, but it is certainly not ok to torture PoW's *pre-trial* in the name of &quot;payback.&quot; No amount of rhetoric in the world is going to make it alright for the United States to torture people. It doesn't matter that Osama and his men did not respect our rights, we still bear the responsibility of being a (supposedly) civilized nation, and *not* a terrorist organization, therefore, we are obligated to treat even prisoners of war in a humane fashion. <br>
<br>
Organizations like Amnesty International exist because sometimes we like to forget that certain people have rights. Maybe in America these people are afghani soldiers, in afghanistan they are women, in China they are political prisoners, etc. AI does not condone terrorism, they are against any inhumane acts upon any citizens of the world, including people who may or may not be associated with terrorism/Osama Bin Laden. Like it or not, part of what makes America the supposed bastion of freedom and goodness that we like to believe in is the fact that we do (supposedly)respect basic human rights, which sets us apart from many other countries in the world. So before you knock organizations like AI for trying to uphold those rights, imagine where the US would be without them.<br>

There has been absolutely NO evidence of any torture whatsoever.<br>
<br>
How do you define torture?  Being securely detained, and blindfolded?<br>
<br>
Being told that your job for the next two months is to watch over folks who will outnumber you 10 to one and have shown a willingness to martyr themselves in order to secure a weapon from guards to stage revolts?  To do this without securely restraining them, and being that poor guy in the picture there with the rifle having to walk by twenty or so prisoners?  <br>
<br>
There have only been what?  3 MAJOR revolts from taliban/al queda prisoners so far?  One of which went on for days and ended up killing hundreds.... I remember the bus incident first, the big one where we found mr Walker, and one other prison that had an uprising that was quelled a lot quicker....<br>
<br>
Yet ppl get thier panties bunched because of the restraints we are now putting on them when out in public?  There have been nothing even hinting at torture, or mistreatment outside of how we are sedating and securing them when they are being moved.... do you think MAYBE the fact these guys revolt every chance they get may be a factor here?<br>

<br>
I agree with this. But what about other countries?  Can't they just be not with either side? They should have a choice.  Siding with us may make them terrorists' next target.  They have to protect their own ppl and have their own interests too. They shouldnt be forced to side with us (that would be a stupid time to go against us, right?).  <br>
<br>
'if you are not doing what you can in your own region to be terrorist free, you are risking the US clearing out your terrorist problem for you'<br>
<br>
this is a bad statement too.  using this statement, you are basically giving US an excuse to send troops to ANY country we want--w/o the permition from the goverment of that country--just because we can...all we have to say is, &quot;we think there are terroroist in your country&quot;.<br>
<br>
War thing.  I still dont like it.  There must be some way to deal with things w/o starting a war.  It's just that most ppl think War is the only way to go w/o thinking of another possibility. O well, of coz...war makes good money for US too...<br>
<br>

<br>
This is totally different from what's going on in that report.  I don't think those prisioners are on trial yet.  Our law is, everyone is innocent unless proven otherwise, and they should be treated as one.  I am always not very proud of some of our poltice officers beat up 'suspects', and then let the 'suspects' used the 'officers beat me' excuse to get by the law eventhough they are actually guilty. And if our 'prisioners' use those lame excuses to get past our &quot;jucicial&quot; system, I don't think any of us would be happy. <br>
<br>
If you gonna do something, do it right.  Don't put up a law and try to enforce it if you are not going to follow it.  Don't agree to follow a law/rule and give lame excuses to get by it when it doesnt fit your need.  (These are also the same thinking i have for the &quot;jucicial&quot; system, as well as the 'report'. =P). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=161.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=161.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=161.topic&start=61&stop=66>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=161.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=161.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=161.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=161.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=161.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=161.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm6">Fear<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm7">Hate<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm8">Sky<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm11">Private Discussion <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm12">Posts Moved</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-freecouons&BL=print>PRINT FREE COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
