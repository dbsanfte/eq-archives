With you.</span><hr size=1> And, because I've gone back through and read your posts, Treelan... I'm going to answer back.<br>
<br>
First, let me just say, holy jesus. Take that as you will. It was the first thing that popped in to my head when I actually read your posts, instead of just skimming. While I try not to argue politics these days (because people get very wound up about it), I am going to make a special exception.<br>
<br>

<br>
Happily, this speaks for itself. Practice what you preach, my friend, and you may find people more willing to listen. As it stands, you've come across as so brainwashed by the radical right-wing, that you're as bad as you seem to think us &quot;liberals&quot; are. You spout ideas without knowledge, logic without reason, and you counter facts (slanted though they may be) with petty personal attacks, opinions, and half-truths (EG, &quot;Anyone who thinks the homeland security bill is bad is an idiot&quot;, &quot;our * Allies * our becoming more and more useless&quot;, &quot;We have way to many holes in our security and something needed to be done&quot;).<br>
<br>
Needless to say, this is not the way to engage in debate. Especially when you point out that the liberal &quot;point of view isn't the only one there is in the world&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If I had nothing better to do with my time I could go through all the ultra right wing media and find a bunch of distorted info about liberals<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Look no further than the Clinton impeachment hearings a few years back. A $10 dry-cleaning bill is no reason to ruin a man's life. Or try, anyway.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Always the people that are not affected complain, one would wonder if your wife, husband, child, mother, or father had been in one of the towers how you would feel about hunting down terrorists and improving our border security<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I have a great friend who lives in New York, where she goes to college. She lost friends in the attack. Lost weeks, maybe months, of her life to the terror that came with the thought of it happening again. And yet, she still protested the &quot;war&quot; with Afghanistan. She realized that we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>cannot win a conventional war against terrorists</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Bombing an already broken and abused people even further back in to the Stone Age is not the answer to the worlds' terrorist problem. In 20 years' time, the US supported regime will be another terrorist haven, the president appointed Dictator-for-life, and the infrastructure destroyed by corrupt cronnyism. And again, we will have to fight.<br>
<br>
Nothing short of a full on black ops mission will get Osama Bin Laden. And I doubt even that will work. He's had a lifetime of avoiding people who want to kill him, and we have very limited experience in trying to capture him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> for the people in Kuwait, would it not have been better to stop Saddam before he invaded them?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not only was Bush I not a psychic, he also knew that doing something stupid like attacking Iraq outright (without the Kuwati provocation) would have earned him a UN reprimand. Jr would do well to learn from his example.<br>
<br>
I have a lot more to say, but I'm tired and I'm fast running out of self control. So I'll end with this.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Your so out of your mind you aren't even worth my time lol.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well said. Good luck, Treelan, these are the last words I'll speak to you on this subject.<br>

<br>
Sapper, your suggestion for the mass eradication of muslims sort of reminds me of Nazis calling for the mass eradication of non blue-eyed caucasians... it's not the religion, but the interpretation of it where most people turn astray.  <br>
<br>
Islam is a very zealous religion, and that fervism can be redirected towards not-so-good things (i.e. killing people).  The religion does preach peace, but it also says to defend your religion from &quot;attackers&quot; of any kind with your life.  The key misinterpretation that these terrorists usually have is seeing the West as some sort of encroaching force hellbent on the destruction of Islam.  Is it unrealistic?  yes.  But the environment in which these people grow up is amazing in terms of the community zeal against the West.  I've lived in Pakistan for a year or so and visited a few times.  I can tell you how utterly unsettling it is to see the hate, how profoundly disturbing it is to see how deeply rooted this hatred goes.  Is the hate based on unrealistic reasons?  Yes, from our perspective.  But not from theirs.  Every time we go into another country, we always masquerade around the sign of &quot;we're here to fight for peace.&quot;  Bullshit, we're here to defend our interests and to keep our asses safe.  And that's the way it should be;  we're not a holy knight crusading around to save the world and keep the peace.  And if you think we are, I point you to the SERBIAN genocide in the late 1980's... where were we then to keep the peace?  What about in 1915, with the armenian genocide by the turks?  Oh wait, we had airbases in the ottoman empire and didn't want to upset our neutrality with them.<br>
<br>
I'm not justifying any act of terrorism or evil.  However, I am trying to point out that it's a very different world outside the US.  For most of us, our primary concerns involve keeping our bills paid and making sure to walk the dog.  In most of these countries, your primary concern is to have enough food/water to live until the next day.  College professors in pakistan get paid about $50 US per month for example. PER MONTH.  With the West trying to globalize everything, how can you expect there to not be antagonism towards us?<br>
<br>
So my point is this.  There's no way to remedy the uneducated masses there.  Is intervention going to be necessary?  Absolutely, especially as we continue to devise more deadly weapons that will trickle down eventually to third-world countries who have nothing better to do than to use them.  But is a wholesale slaughter of everyone of a particular religious preference really necessary simply because we view them as a threat?  Take note, motherfucker, of why this country was first established.  Remember the Holocaust.  Remember the Inquisition.  And then think of what you're suggesting, you Nazi.<br>
<br>
Go watch American History X if you want an expose` on hatred and what it does to people.  Until then, be glad you're hiding behind an internet alias, because the thought of smashing your thick skull into a bloody pulp simply to rid the world of your uneducated nazi ass has crossed my mind, as I'm sure it has of any other person with half a brain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kuluvien>Kuluvien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/30/02 3:35:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=708.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm neutral in this argument..</span><hr size=1> And on another note:  go live in a third world country for a few months.

 Laur, just because your a guildie, doesn't mean I agree with your politics, nor would I engage in that sort of debate in a game such as EQ, really I wonder why it is even on a game flame board, I saw it and got sucked into it. I believe it or not have many liberal friends, I don't agree with them, and we often have heated debate but in the end we are still friends. Just because your ideas are goofy ( as I'm sure you will say about me ) doesn't mean your a bad person. <br>
<br>
 I am a conservative, however I am not a radical, I also think that the &quot; middle &quot; so many liberals and democrats want people to venture into is a crock as well. In my opinion, the middle is for people that have no belief or views, or can never make up there mind...or want to get elected ( Al Gore ) sorry shameless poke...<br>
<br>
 The poster of this thread has asked this not be debated here, should you wish to continue mail me a link to a board where it such discussion is wanted. Until that time...<br>

<br>
Im in the GWB is a freaking moron camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
1)  We have failed since 9/11 to accomplish our number 1 goal.    <br>
Bin Laden slew the Great Towers;  Bin Laden must not live.  Remember that?  That was GWBs #1 priority post 9/11.   Death to Bin Laden.   Fine.  but we failed.  No proof either way.  Bush's branch says he is alive.  A swedish company says he is dead.    No proof either way.  Now bush is like a distracted baby.  Must crush iraq  must crush iraq.  But where is his focus?  Its not on bin laden any more.  WHy? cause if bush focus's on whether hes accomplished his goal with bin laden he has to come to terms with the sloppy job he's done.  Im not saying he is &quot;wagging the dog&quot;  im saying hes avoiding the area he failed in.    But a true leader wouldnt have got to this point.  A truely wise leader would have hounded that man to the ends of the earth successfully; simply because he said he was going to.<br>
<br>
2)  Setting ourselves up for 3 aggressions in 3 years.    <br>
2001  we agress/counterattack afghanistan.<br>
2003 we agress iraq.<br>
2004 a muslim country announces its giving refuge to the remeants of the taliban.  what do you do? agress?<br>
2004 iran becomes militant along with fundamentalist.  what do you do? agress?<br>
<br>
The first decade of the 21st century will be marked by 3 campaigns by one country?  What does history show such countries turn into?  An axis.   The great superpower axis of the early 21st century is a real potential write of our future historians.  In negotiating with russia for an attack on iraq we agreed to support by ignoring russias aggression against cheknyia.   How isnt that an axis when 2 countries align by dividing up what countries each can attack?   Democracy so peaceful la~  must have been a phase.<br>
<br>
3) Saddam falls and all the kings men cant put iraq back together again.<br>
<br>
Iraq has 3 ethnic groups.  1 is an incredible minority and has traditionally ruled iraq.   1 is is a huge majority and has serious relation issues with all of middle east.  1 lives in north iraq next to turkey.   Turkey artificial divides that group in half.   In all of this is a web of militants and h8rs.  Splinctering this will create terrorist in new found freedom.  years of propoganda + loss of central control = major actively prosued instability.  iraq will never be a democracy. This is a complicated long term project that bush wants to embark on.  this from a man that couldnt bring another man to a known justice and now wants to move on to something more complicated?<br>
<br>
<br>
4) Homeland security is foolish.  <br>
Defense department was created after ww2 not during ww2.   A massive reorganization of duties and intelligence while you need those duties performed in a big way is dumb.  Further there is no real reason to think it would have prevented 9/11.  big agencies are traditionally slower moving then smaller ones.  Dept of HS will have 70,000 employees.   Also inherit in this is bad design of federalism imo.  the department is to big.  Any high level infiltration of that thing in the turmoultous decades to come will have serious consequences to america.<br>

Really that's the dumbest thing I've ever read. The Muslim belief is in no way evil or wrong. It's a religion and not a bad one either. It's the people who take it to the damn extreme and use it to justify the murder of others who need to be eradicated.

Fact is over 75% of americans support George Bush jr's actions taken on afghanistan and Iraq. Polls dont lie, and the people that answer polls are the people that vote and matter when it comes to democratic elections for the most part.<br>
     I know people that used to live in pakistan and frequently went to afghanistan and the Taliban were terrible people, The US takes cheap shots here and there from just about every other country because the manner in which we push world peace is very agressive and mainstream. Goes for anything, the more action done the more critism.<br>
   To say that any President of the United States wants to go to war is ignorant. War and the stuff that comes with it hurts the economy, puts more burdens on the president, and makes his job 100 times harder. <br>
   Bush doesnt want war with Iraq, why would a president that pushes world peace want to blow up innocent civilians in Iraq, Innocent civilians which he often expresses his sympathys to on the count of Saddam using chemical weapons on them, yes, on his own people. Saddam has been bucking and weaving his way out of weapons inspections for years, lieing and cheating his way out of a RULE, MADE by the United Nations. Obviously this guy has dangerous weapons and chemicals that he'd most definatly use on other countries that oppose him, if he uses them on his own people. Bush wants Saddam to abide by the rules which he said he would abide by, not war.<br>
  GWB may have said a few times that Getting Osama bin Laden dead or alive is a important goal, But it all leads to terrorism. GWB has quoted this agression twards Terrorism the &quot;war on terror&quot;, not the &quot;war on osama bin laden&quot;. Osama leads a islamic radical terrorist group and Saddam funds them and gives them a safe place to sleep. <br>
   Regardless of what GWB wants, the UN voted 15-0 (yes that includes most of Europe) on sending weapon inspectors back to Iraq, and to give Saddam one last chance. To not follow this resolution, would result in Military force. All 15 countries in the UN backed this proposal 100%. So the people that say that GWB is a warmonger, dont forget to include the presidents of those 15 countries as well.<br>
  I challenge some of you guys to get your information from unbiased and moderate sources, its alot more interesting then reading peoples opinions all day and you might learn something. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=303416">Tenalin's Shit</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Done with backroom deals imo not neccessarily on the merits of invading iraq.  *If* it can be shown that america traded a non critical official United States stance on russias treatment of cheknia in exchange for Russias not using veto power on the security resolution and quietly supporting/aquiescing  to the resolution wouldnt that change your opinion of the value of detirmining right with the UN vote?  Its tainted then.  The merits of UN voting in favor of enforcment against iraq should be independant of russias treatment of rebels.   yet its not.  <br>
<br>
Or excuse me it &quot;may be&quot; not.   But keep in mind this resolution was favored by a russia whos populace has a skeptical eye aimed at america and whos major industries have had deals with iraq.   A skeptic is compelled to stay critical.   <br>
<br>
I hold most likey the UN vote was an example of power brokering and international politics.  I hold that the UN vote had little to do with whats right about what to do with iraq but rather what america wants to do with iraq. and what america is willing to trade for it.  <br>
<br>
i guess the gist of my counter argument is that the UN resolution cannot be used to favor bush becuase bush influenced its outcome.  Its like saying judge this post.  judge right and you get  a million platinum pieces.  TY for loving this post.<br>
<br>
Of course someone might hold that nations might not be so easily bribed.   thats a sophisiticated question but i got ten bucks that says a survey would show examples of countries trading ethics on one issue for agreement on another issue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gypsysongman>Gypsy Songman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Lout<br><font color=blue>QC Supporter</span><br>  Posts: 491<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/1/02 4:58:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=708.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.houston.rr.com/neuromt/pwned.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm neutral in this argument..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Polls dont lie<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

yeah its a new age, world peace is the goal, international diplomacy yada yada... but for everyone that has any doubt... dont forget you are american first. i vote for the leaders of this nation to represent me. not to have some delegate from other nations dictate my leaders policies to us. if it seems gwb is manipulating the votes of the UN... i say its about damn time. if UN or other nations dont like it... get off american soil, defend yourselves against the hitlers, husseins, bin ladens of the world. put &quot;return to sender&quot; on our aide packages and let us get our money back as tax payers instead of funding your military, govt, and economy.<br>
<br>
and if you dont like this great country, name one better... yeah we have our problems, our flaws... but screw the world when i say this is the best damn place to live and be called a citizen. our time may end someday, as all world powers and empires have before... but rest assured, that day isnt in the near future.<br>

You mean... the fact that they don't want us interfering with their politics has nothing to do with their dislike for us? It's funny how some of you think they ought to be grateful for the U.S. dominating the political arena. Pick up a history book and put yourself in their shoes for a minute. I know it's hard because it requires an attention span that can outlast CNNs news snapshots, but you may actually come out of it with a new perspective. It's also quite funny how Americans believe they have the right to make war on a nation because we can't sifter out the terrorists networks, yet just this summer the President thought India and Pakistan were not sovereign enough to declare war on one another over the matter of Kashmir and urged them to handle it peacefully. But we'll be damned if we listen to other countries! Do as I say, not as I do.

Gah. Here we go with credit where it isn't due again. Bush Sr. <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">lost</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> because of the economy. After all, if he could win a war, why couldn't things back home get back on track on their own? A lot of Clinton's success with the economy could be attributed to Alan Greenspan. During the 90's Republicans wondered why Greenspan didn't do more to move the economy out of recession while Bush Sr. was in office. Does that sound like Reagan's administration planned a flash in the pan for Bush to you? Neither party wants a one-term president.<br>
<br>
As for saying those in the Clinton camp think he was cool for busting a nut in the Oval Office (which I bet is no Guinness first), IMO Gore lost the race not only because he was a self-absorbed little prick, but also for losing the women's vote when his captain pissed off one too many mothers by forcing them to censure the evening news from their children for months.<br>
