Which is preposterous to anyone with even a passing knowlege of objectivism. Which is why I commented on the irony. And a passing knowlege is about what I have. I have read her more 'popular' sermons.. err novels. As well as a couple of critiques.<br>

A claim is a statement of fact or proposed statment of fact. If I say there is this thing called objectivism and from what I have read its X, is saying - here is what I have read - its categorically not a claim to be a total synopsis of the entire subject. Additionally, saying the word Objectivism, does not imply expertise in the subject nor does in make any claims. Particularly in the light that I said I was no expert on the subject.

<br>
I disagree with stating that one's allocation of their resources for future use is greedy.  First of all greed is defined by excess, wanting or taking more than you reasonably need.  It does not have to be at anyone's expense necessarily but it doesn't usually become an issue until that point.<br>
<br>
Your first duty is to meet the basic needs of survival and relative comfort (Not to excess.) of yourself and your family.  Saving for the future, or in the event of tragedy (No one lives forever.) to ensure that your needs and those of your family are provided for so you or they can maintain the current lifestyle is not greedy.  Rather it's greedy to simply presume someone else tomorrow will and should provide for your needs.  Placing the blame of poverty and disease (Which will always be present.) and the burden of eliminating them upon a select few solely because they currently live better off than someone else is ridiculous and ultimately results in nothing more than transferring the problem from one party to the next. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontyydaogre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montyy Da Ogre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>fat ass</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/5/02 1:53:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=304>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> *head explodes*<br>

I certainly do not disagree, but how do you quantify what is enough?<br>
<br>
Certainly the lifestyle I enjoy would be viewed as 'excessive' by anyone not living in america, yet, would be viewed as entirely substandard in Manhattan or parts of California<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I know for a fact that I make much more than I need to survive. Anyone that plays EQ could be argued to as well. Clearly they earn enough that they do not have to work during the time they play EQ. Hence they make too much and are hoarding resources. So there needs to be a tax on anyone who plays EQ<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Reality is we americans enjoy a superior standard of living. The rest of the world views us as 'greedy' because of it. We have resources to spare and they are starving. Dying.<br>
<br>
In EQ no one is dying. No one 'needs' anything in EQ. It's a game, there is no need. Whatever the word 'need' connotes, it is not relevant to EQ.<br>
<br>
Whatever you want to call it, 'greed' is either right or wrong. RL is certainly a zero sum game at any point you pick. Some have excess, and some are starving to death. We accept this as ok, not wishing to give up our own resources, despite the fact that the people that lack them think this is about the definition of evilness. To give to some we would have to take from others.<br>
<br>
The one universally true thing about the word 'greed' is it is used by a person when someone else has something they want.<br>
<br>

Ultimately, it's not. As soon as guilds get enough burners in house it will be the only reasonable way to kill these mobs.<br>
<br>
Ragefire, for example, which is not contested, is already regularly burned. And why not?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> yet Sev gets ganked 2 times in one week <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You know damned well the first wasn't a gank. The one Saturday sure looks gankish. I don't know the details, we can hope the guilty parties are chastised and it won't happen again. If not I am sure they will gain a rep appropriate to their activity. If they do they will stop getting invited to burns because other burners will not want to be associated.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You still can't come up with a better defense than that guilds should camp dragons and mobolize faster...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
How would you advise people whining at you because they were trying to compete with you and failed?<br>
<br>

<br>
You post a lot for being so bored<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
MB will become the tool of choice for killing these mobs. Right now there is not a lot of competition (though there is some) between burners because usually there's barely enough free to kill any mob that's up and unclaimed. Often they cannot be burned for lack of people. But in time there will inevitably be competing teams, much as I will hate to see it. These competing teams will sort along guild lines. When this happens and single guild burn team will have no overweening reason to be considerate and demur to another guild setting up an MT raid. It will be guild vs guild. All this MB vs traditional raid discussion will be obsolete, since eventually, no one will try to kill them the traditional way, unless they just don't have enough burners. Which will be an untenable situation for guilds involved in acquiring epics.<br>
<br>
VI has reiterated at Fan Faire once again that they have no intention of nerfing MB, and think it's fine the way it is.<br>
<br>
They have been known to change their mind, on occasion, but I doubt this is such an occasion.<br>

<br>
I'd agree with the definition of greed but do you really know anyone like that? Even Bill Gates doesnt sound like that and you will commonly find an opinion on the streets that he is greedy.<br>
<br>
Killing a kunark dragon for loot every once and a while doesnt even fit the definition.<br>

Anyway I have no problem with thread drift. MB is old but the topic of greed is interesting because so many people talk about it but don't really think about it.<br>
<br>
Like Fkin..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Taking stuff you dont really need out from under the nose of people who do need to - thats greed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok tell me 1st how you can appropriately use the term 'need' anything in EQ. There's nothing in EQ that anyone 'needs'.<br>
<br>
Second what does it mean 'that you don't really need'. How much money do you 'really need'? A frugal person can live perfectly well and retire making 35k. But people want more. Single people compete just as strongly for raises as people that support a spouse. People that only support a spouse compete just as strongly for raises as people with 2 kids. And those people compete with people with 6 kids and supporting mom and pop back in the mother country on top. <br>
<br>
Why is this ok? Where do we draw the line?<br>
<br>
In EQ no one will starve. Hell no one will even not have fun. If they fail to have what they consider enough fun for their $13/mo they'll just make another toon, or play another game.<br>
<br>
As much as anyone 'needs' anything, burners 'need' dragon loot as much as anyone else. They 'need' spells (like Blal I still do not have all my Kunark spells), they 'need' a white dragonhide, they 'need' epic drops and dragon haste for guildmates. Their EQ family.<br>
<br>
Still, individuals get these drops. Anyone with any sense will, and has, camped these mobs and then called in their guild and friends when the mob pops, or else if they can't get enough, call in a burn team. In fact with a burn team their chances of getting the drop is much much higher, since if the item drops they get it, and they do not have to roll. That's the usual arrangement anyway. A warrior can even pull for sev.. if he has soe or a sow potion and strafes, tho a bard is better.<br>
<br>
Who is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> suffering?<br>
<br>
Any individual can now camp these mobs with some assurance of success. Used to be there is a window of opportunity where they have enough support to get the mob, which made it less appealing to camp it, since if the mob popped when you had no help.. you were screwed. Now, they can get their guild, if they are online and not busy, or call in burners if they can't get enough support otherwise. So a_warrior_01 or a_paladin_02 or a_bard_03 now finds it much easier to get these drops. I have received tells a lot from people I do not know saying they are camping some mob and would I burn it when it pops. Knowing this I save burn, and when it pops that person is one step closer to their epic.. for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  free</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> if it drops. They also have the option to purchase them since the price has dropped due to the increased turnover of these mobs from increased competition. Also some rich people that don't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  feel</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like camping the mob they need have sent burners tells saying they want such and such drop for such and such amount. In these cases that information is disseminated and usually the next time the item drops for a burn team the item is sold and then divvied up to the team that got it.<br>
<br>
Thus there are varying levels of work someone can do to get these drops to get the item for free if they want to camp it from 'commisioning a hit' if they are flush and want it asap.<br>
<br>
So who really has reason to complain?<br>
<br>
Guildleaders and would be raidleaders who used to have no competition for these mobs. And who don't have enough burners themselves because they had melee centric recruiting biases.<br>
<br>
As for a &quot;feeling of accomplishment&quot; from getting it yourself?<br>
<br>
Ask anyone who has camped a dragon then pulled a dragon to a burn team for their epic piece if they feel like they &quot;didn't participate&quot;.<br>
<br>
It's a heck of a lot more personal than being one of a dozen melees zerging a dragon. 1 of 6 is more participation than 1 of 25. Sorry.<br>
<br>
Moreover they do serve a purpose other than pulling. They DO tank. It's only 30 seconds but it's a very important 30 seconds. With a non burning puller the odds of fear ruining the kill is less.<br>
<br>
The only bad thing about this situation is that if some guild comes in fast your burn team may get cold feet. I can see some pressure to lie to the burn team in this circumstance.<br>
<br>
Which is why I think anyone camping these mobs should spam the zone that they are camping them, and resolve conflicts before the pop even happens.<br>
<br>
But in most all instances where someone camped a mob and called burners in as soon as it pops there have been no contests.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Manaburn doesn't unbalance the game in the least, nope....<br>
<br>
Fact is Manaburn needs a nerf, plain and simple. <br>
<br>
All Verrant needs to do is give manaburn a debuff icon on the mob that lasts 30 seconds or so. This way only one burn lands at a time. This would make burning the kunark dragons a lot harder from what i understand, not impossible, but lots harder, making the risk vs. reward more in line with a dragon encounter. It would also STILL allow wizzys to use this awesome skill for which it was intended, to burn down them really BIG mobs that take 10 minutes to fight. <br>
<br>
I like wizzys fine, and I think this ability is great for them, however bottom feeders like those idiots make me sick. Some wizzys (note i said SOME) have got this &quot;Look who's got the big dick now!!!!!&quot; Syndrome from 50 levels of LFG with no response. <br>
