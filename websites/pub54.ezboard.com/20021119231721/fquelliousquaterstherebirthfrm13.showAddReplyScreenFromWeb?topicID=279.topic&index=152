I have put everything from my logs that were said in OOC by trist/add/me (unless I unintentionally missed something), a conversation between me and Neo in group chat (others could confirm this), periodic /who of the zone, and the attack made by me on the Shissir.  I stress again how there is NO way for me to have taken agro unless everyone is lieing totally about how things went about when Verbo pulled - the only time I had a chance to cast anything on the Shissir was when I initially agroed it (damn I wish I woulda taken screenshots), it runs very fast, and I only got up within casting range again when it was running past the Fetid Feind house on the western wall, but by that time it was nearly being attacked by ADD's force.  The only time I could have been in range to attack it was when it was unagroed - I could not have gotten within melee range to attack at any other time.  If Verbo could post his logs of when he attacked it, we could perhaps compare the logs and see who truely engaged first.  From a comment about Trist training him, he must have had logs on.  However, I feel all these words are wasted on most of the people from ADD, specially Feadorn, who has proven to take no consideration of what someone said when making a response.<br>
<br>
Anyways.. here are my logs.  Again, nothing is left out, nothing but what I have down was said by ADD to me or in public channels while I was in the zone is in the posted logs.  Admittedly I gated to Misty for a few minutes.. which I will put in the logs. If I missed anything, it was from that time.<br>

Just a point to ADD folks....<br>
<br>
Even if we are to believe you had your raid force just outside fear for hours on end just waiting for the good word to move in.... you surrendered the &quot;moral right&quot; to the spawn doing so.<br>
<br>
<br>
If any raid guild wants a mob, they move in to it.  If we want tomax, and someone spots Vis in kael, it's followed with a &quot;how many?&quot;... if there isn't a raid force active there, we don't send darkoor tells asking him to roll for the mob before either of us have a raid force in zone, we mobilize... if there is a raid force there when all we got is a spotter, or an xp group....we go spot something else, or we  get some xp.<br>
<br>
&quot;rolling for rights&quot; or whatever compromise and diplomacy,  is for when 2 raid forces trickle (or flood) in at the same time.<br>
