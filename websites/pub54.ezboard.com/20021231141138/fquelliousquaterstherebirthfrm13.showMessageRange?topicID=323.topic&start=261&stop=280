<br>
I play the game to have fun and to help my comrades. Why do you play?<br>
<br>
I suppose you would refuse to help a comrade or guildmate who needed something that it would be much easier for you to get for them than it would be for them. That's not the kind of person I am tho.<br>
<br>
The fact is everyone needs help, a LOT of help to get their epic drops. How much does a Druid contribute to killing Jade reavers? How much does a Wiz contribute to killing the EG? They go on a raid and win a roll or someone else wins a roll when they aren't there and they get it MQ'd if the piece is not droppable. Pally's have gone on burn raids to loot a book, they can even help by holding aggro, lowering the risk of wiping.<br>
<br>
They may have been one of 30 or one of 6 or even not there.. what is particularly significant about this?<br>
<br>
The shocker is that some high AA characters are more help in some situations than mid fifties characters.<br>
<br>
Who does this really hurt? Individuals are getting the drops they need that much faster. Mid level guilds can more easily mobilize because for every burner they have that they can get there thats about 5 less 55's they need. People in uber guilds who mostly cannot be bothered to kill these mobs now have a viable option to complete their epics.<br>
<br>
Who is suffering? Really?<br>
<br>
The guildleaders of melee centric mid level guilds that mistreated their casters and are now finding they have a lot less power to decide who gets what epic drops.<br>
<br>
I don't see anyone else suffering, on Quelious anyway.<br>
<br>
To those guildleaders I will just say: things change. Send a tell to your wizzies sometimes and say hi when you don't need a port. Ask how they are doing. Invite them on a fear raid, and not always hate raids. For that matter be nice to your mages and necros. Just be nice to people, period, and your guild won't get lopsided.<br>

<br>
This seems to be about classes that get one big ability that tends to dominate in raids.<br>
<br>
First Warriors got defensive, which allows them to take a lot more damage and still keep aggro.  Lots of people thought this was overpowered.  With this ability and CH, a mob can be kept on a single target and under control, allowing huge mobs to be dealt with in realitively smaller groups than before.<br>
<br>
VI had two choices, they could nerf defensive, or adjust mobs around it and increase the power of other toons so they catch up with the warrior.  VI had a long history of nerfs and taking flack from those nerfs.  VI decided not to nerf defensive.  Therefore other toons need to be upped in power.<br>
<br>
With AA, warriors didn't get much in class abilities, nothing really overpowering.  Seems like AoE taunt is the nicest, but really just a convenient ability, nothing overpowering.  Some toons though were targeted for upgrade it seems.<br>
<br>
Wizzards got MB, and like wizzards, nothing subtle.  Because of this, it is going to be one of the first &quot;class defining&quot; abilities to be noticed.  One note here, MB takes alot of post 60 work to get to, unlike defensive which comes along to every warrior at level 55.<br>
<br>
Chanters, necros and druids got dire charm.  A bit more subtle, and with limitations, but potentially as deadly if not more deadly than MB.  Mobs are alot more powerful than toons, and properly controled and buffed, can do alot more for alot longer than a wizzard manaburn.  Of course this is only starting to be of concern, again because it takes a while to get the AA for it, and longer to really know how to use it.<br>
<br>
Rangers got increased arrow damage and endless quiver.  I'm speculating here, but it seems like a group of rangers on the fastest horses and best arrows can kite about anything if they have the room for it and it doesn't summon.<br>
<br>
What does all this mean?  Well VI can either nerf, or try to pull all the other classes up to the highest power classes.  Given VI's recent trends, I would say they won't nerf.  This means that people start complaining about the how unfair the other classes abilities are, and with the next expansion, other classes get &quot;class defining abilites&quot;.  Also mobs will be tuned to provide more of a challenge to these abilities.  Look to see even more mobs summon and hp to go up even more.  Maybe even special abilites or resistances to compensate.  Then those abilities become manditory to take down the uber mobs.<br>
<br>
The moral of this is that one class seeming to overpower other classes is just part of the cycle of evolving and not nerfing.  The first toons to get the treatment will be left behind as new toons get the treatment, kinda like computer upgrades, those that got the latest will be the best.  The first ones to get it won't get upgraded until everyone else gets the treatment.<br>
<br>
When PoP comes out, I predict mages will dominate the game (but maybe I'm wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
Is manaburn too powerful?  I guess it just seems that way to alot of people at the moment.  It won't stay dominant. People will discover other dominant abilities, and with upgrades class x will dominate with special ability y.  Just the way the cycle goes.<br>

<br>
Excuse me if I take this a bit personal, but when I come on this thread to initially voice my opinion about how MB can be a bad thing in certain situations, and then get bombarded by people either telling me I have class envy or even saying that its all ok becuase they are 'better' than me since they have more AA. The mobs effected by MB in this fashion in NO WAY effect my EQ gaming experience, I have no need nor want of anything from them, cept maybe a green scale which I'll get one day in VP anyway.  But they still do effect many people in our EQ community, and I dont see how it is fair to them how a few people can run around virtually uncontesteed and blast mobs that they might try to kill.  I guess younger guilds will just have to start out raiding Velious mobs cuz most of those are safe from MB.<br>
<br>
And as far as epic bits not being sold for profit, I think that I saw Rapiki selling a Vox pally book for MQ just tonight, and I've seen a lot of dragon haste items up on the auction boards  from MB wizzies.... heh oh well, I guess wizzies are gonna have the best twinks running around the server now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1 ) I need the hide for my Damage III cloak.  About the only option until I can get to NToV or Luclin boss mobs.  Spider fur cap from cazic is the last option but I dont want to replace my circlet of falikan.<br>
<br>
2 ) Spells... The allusive Sunstrike which I've been trying for 5 months to get comes off of them.. as well as other 60 spells I'm still lacking.<br>
<br>
3 ) Plenty of people in my guild need the epic pieces as well.  No charge to them if I win the roll<br>
<br>
4 ) If I get a CoF then I might use it to buy some of my spells... If they are ever for sale.<br>
<br>
Would you rather me fork out 40-50k for these? <br>
<br>
I just find it really funny to listen to melee bitch about their epic piece crying about how the mobs are never up.  Then when they are up for awhile... and they have been a few times.  Those same melee weren't rallying forces to take the mobs down.<br>
<br>
That's just crying to be crying.<br>

<br>
For guildies fine, I agree - but go make your 50k elsewhere and more honourably than frying Kunark dragons.  <br>
<br>
Dragons contrary to what you said specifically in Kunark, do not remain up long at all because of the MB skill.<br>
<br>
Do I think MB should exist ? yes I do - do I think it should be catergorised not to affect trivialised mobs - yes I do.  <br>
<br>
And to previous poster, do I think warrior defensive skill is overpowered ? jesus no - thats the only think that stops up from being obselete in the game. <br>

If wizards didnt have MB would they become obsolete ? no definitely not. Would they be underpowered if MB was unable to be used against trivialised mobs - no again.  <br>
<br>
Do I think you are being a tad unreasonable Pal - well you have made some valid points which is good, but you are not really looking at the bigger picture.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/upalaziousfrydaddy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palazious Frydaddy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/28/02 7:07:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=323.topic&index=268>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This may touch some nerves, but WTF lets see what happen</span><hr size=1> Not looking at the picture?<br>

I need the hide... I need my spells.<br>
<br>
So you would suggest I buy them rather then kill a mob for them?<br>
<br>
Ya dumbfuck. laff  ..  Thats like telling those who need epic pieces to buy them rather then hunt for them.<br>
<br>
If your disgusted in someone wanting to 'kill' for their stuff then you've been playing the 2-faced penis-envy prick-from-hell this whole thread.<br>

I guess you can be disgusted all you want at someone who wants to hunt for their stuff rather then buy it.  I guess that would put you favoring e-bay over leveling your own character.<br>

Monty it just shows the difference between you and me. In point of fact it is EXACTLY for those reasons that I have killed dragons. Maybe YOU would never think to give a scale or a dragon haste item away to a guildmate. But I assure you everyone is not as selfish as you. I have gotten spells I need from them and still have one yet to get that I need. I have gotten gear I WEAR from them. I have gotten epic drops and drgon haste items and have given them to guildmates. In fact all that I have gotten has gone to guildmates.<br>
<br>
I have not sold one <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> single</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> thing I have won from a burn hit to date. Know what you are talking about next time.<br>
<br>
Should I tell a cleric in my guild, &quot;no sorry I can't burn the PP for you, that would trivialize the encounter for you and I can't be part of that&quot;?<br>
<br>
I thought guilds were about cooperation and people that people helped each other.

So piki sold a pally book. Does that make him a farmer? Piki seems like standup cattle to me, I personally don't begrudge him selling a book. How much did he sell it for? I bet the price is a hell of a lot lower than it used to be.<br>
<br>
Personally I think occasional book sales serve a purpose. The top guilds can rarely be bothered to kill these mobs and most of the members are loaded, but they want epics why shouldn't they be able to get them?<br>
<br>
Have you never sold ANYTHING Montyy? Well I assure you the person you sold it to needed it, thus you took content away from them that you DIDN'T need. You just wanted PP. How selfish of you.<br>
<br>
As for getting personal, you did it. I didn't attack you. Take some responsibility for your actions. By all means respond if someone attacks you but go after the right person, not anyone who happens to disagree with you.<br>

With the mobs having thousands upon thousands of HP, MB will be effectively worthless... and we'll be right back to the Warrior/Cleric methods.  With the Warrior AE Taunt, wont that trivialize the MT Swaps since the use of the ability instantly moves the Warrior to the top of the aggro list?<br>

Not only will the swaps be flawless, but the replaced tank gets to stay alive, and thus continue the battle.<br>

<br>
This whole thing started by Ral posting an opinion on how he thought that MB could be problematic in the future.  He was immediatedly attacked by the wizard comunity as having class envy because he had these thoughts, and when others voiced similar opinions as Ral, like myself, they were attacked as well.<br>
<br>
At least some wizards (like Montague) have at least admitted that they can see a problem with MB on pre velious mobs (less than 32k hp) and I see this as a good thing, yet the majority of you still see this as some sort of pissing contest, or my penis is bigger than yer penis dispute between wizards and warriors (seeing as its mostly warriors that have spoken here)  <br>
<br>
I call you a farmer because that is what you are period. Farming Kunark dragons or farming the AC in SRo or farming hounds in WW....its all farming.  I never really liked it back in the day when it was only dr00ds doing it, and I still dont like it now that wizards are doing it on a grander scale. If you really give away everything you've gotten so far from burn raids(sorry i find that highly dubious <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), that doesnt make it any better....MB wizzies account for less than 1% of our EQ server, yet they are killing at least 80% of these mobs in question.  So are you saying that if I were lvl 55 and wanted a CoF or a RBB, Id have to suck up to a MB wizard to get it? Cuz theres no way a mid level guild can compete otherwise.<br>
<br>
I have nothing against wizards as a class, in fact I quite like them.  This has to do with verant giving one group of people the power to do what 99.5% of the rest of the people cant do. I would think it sucked if it were dr00ds who could do it, or rangers, or even /gasp warriors.  <br>

<br>
You've taken your definition of farming to the most outrageous extremes.  By your own definition, if you've killed a willowisp and sold the greater lightstone, then you're a farmer, and have taken content away from some caster who could have turned it in to Mrysilla for the concordance of research.<br>
<br>
You've slowly whittled your own argument down to nothing more than a petty nit-pick of you hyperbolic anti-farming code of ethics.  Quite frankly, if people weren't killing mobs for their drops there would be no in-game economy.  Verant has stated many many many times that that want a healthy in-game economy, and have designed the game to support it.  Your insistence on imposing your fundamentalist loner agenda into all of your replies is a red herring, and it's starting to stink real real bad now...<br>
<br>
You have also Indeed gone out of your way to make your argument personal against FK..  FK is a 250 smith, guilded with a 250 tailor, and another 250 human smith..  FK has ZERO need to farm for her daily bread..  You obviously do not know her, and are talking out of your ass when you say that you &quot;find it highly dubious&quot; that she hasn't sold a drop from a burn encounter.   What on earth would make you say that...?  Perhaps everyone just /cons dubious with you.  You sling the word &quot;farmer&quot; at FK simply to get a rise out of her, because you've long since abandoned even the facade of reason.  You've used the most generalized and extreme analogies to support your argument that MB wizzies deny game content, and seem to be blaming FK for some dark future of EQ that you have alone have prophesized.<br>

If you want a CoF or RBB, go kill the mobs.  Just like ADD and EHL have done the past 2 weeks, and I'm sure they arent the only guilds.

Penis envy anyone?  They didnt give us Defensive or CH either, do you see us whining about it? Probably the 2 most high-powered skills/spells in the game?  Why not? because thats your jobs!  Wizards job is to make @#%$ blow the @#%$ up.  It's called 'class defining skills' in case you've never heard of them.<br>
<br>
Our arguments have been posted repeatedly now... but you seem to avoid them like they are cursed.  If you want to convince us MB is overpowering, confront those issues and show us why we are wrong instead of pulling @#%$ outta your ass to cloud the issues.  Hell, convince me.. show me how those arguments of ours are wrong and you might even convince me your right.<br>

I believe that both Garaddor and Sephrok are guild leaders for their respected guilds. As such, they would have the authority and possible need to sell excessive guild items that the whole guild may have received over time in its actions. What they are selling by far does not indicated any farming what so ever, IMO. It indicates an active raiding guild with excessive amount of items. The majority of the guilds on our servers do this as a given.<br>

<br>
Just to let you know, Palazious. Sunstrike does drop from the Guardian Wurms in Skyfire. We got Ylferdin his copy last week while camping Ragefire for Mysses. We actually had a very good set of spells received while camping Ragefire from these Guardian Wurms. We received Tears of Prexus and Sunstrike for Ylferdin, Torpor and Malo for Tapes as well as several other high level shaman, druid, cleric and enchanter spells.<br>

Just because manaburn isn't being abused (yet) on our server doesn't mean that it isn't being abused  elsewhere. I now change my stance on the issue and think that there should be a nerf on manaburn. I think they should make it NOT work on mobs that are flagged as *dragon* and have less than 32001hp.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
While this is very possible as to a way they could reduce the effectiveness of manaburn, I personally think this would be the worse way. As I stated before, the best trait of manaburn is that it is available to small guilds to use in what to them would be major raid events. As Gurunt is stating, these dragons ARE major events to some small guilds. Manaburn allows them to possibly defeat these events easier. Restricting it to not work on mobs that are flagged as a dragon would be restricting it from working on the mobs that you would only use it on. Lets face it, no manaburning wizard would use their ability on a spider in Velks. No, they will save it for the major (to them) event that they could possibly participate in within the next hour.<br>
<br>
I think the major thing that most people have with manaburn is not necessarily that is does major damage. Wizards are supposed to do major damage. It is that this major damage is stackable with other wizards and is cummalative with them. That makes it possible for a group of wizards to do something that no other single group can do. Kill a Kunark (or Velious) dragon without the possibility of that dragon getting a counter-attack. If there was a way to make it so that these mobs could get a counter-attack against a group of wizards using manaburn, I believe the reasonable people who dislike the current state of manaburn will have no problem with it. The only way I see for this to be possible is if they placed a 1 tick buff on the mob it was casted against. This removes that insta-kill technique that is currently occurring with 6 (or 12) wizards that seems to upset so many people. It removes the stack-ability of manaburn.<br>
<br>
-Wadin Pureheart of Quellious<br>
Warder<br>
<br>
PS&gt; Rather if manaburn should be nerfed or not and rather if our own wizard in the Quellious community are abusing the ability, I personally believe that manaburn WILL be nerfed. Why? Because it IS being abused on other servers, and Verant generally does not make a change to a class ability that affects only a couple servers. It is sad, but it is true. And I do not think Graffe website is helping much with changing this state. From what I seen, it has been more of a challenged to see which server can do much bigger and more showy things with the ability over on that site.<br>

If enough people whine they will nerf it. Maybe. Even though they are on record saying they have no intention of diong so.<br>
<br>
There was an incident of a burn team on some server that steamrolled a raid on VS. (I forget the server but it's all there in gory detail on Graffes)<br>
<br>
The fact that guilds steamroll other guilds everyday will be overlooked, and instead it will be all burners are bad.<br>
<br>
I may be a polyanna but look at what is happenning with Ragefire.. I think this server is at least slightly better than average and I really cannot envision a burn team steamrolling a raid. Burners back down a lot and never even say anything.<br>
<br>
But the fact of the matter is when one guild steamrolls or merely honestly beats another to the punch it is because they have more powerful toons so the need to organize fewer people and are thus quicker, or else extremely good mobilization. Burn teams are just a continuation of this trend.<br>
<br>
Burn teams are easier to mobilize, on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> paper</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but the fact is that a lot of the time these poeple are doing stuff with their own guild and are not free to flit off.<br>
<br>
A guildleader can call a drop everything, but burners have no way to push other burners.<br>
<br>
(When a lot of guilds can field burn teams in house this question will pretty much go away anyway, it will become normal to send a burn team to hit a dragon, and it will again be the same people contending as before, but that's another issue)<br>
<br>
Anyway Wadin you have some good points but you have made one incorrect assumption that seems to be rampant:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ..Kill a Kunark (or Velious) dragon without the possibility of that dragon getting a counter-attack..- Wadin<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is unbased. Dragon fear is longer range than Manaburn and if one burner gets feared, it's a good likelihood of a wipe. If two do it's almost a certainty. It's not at all a sure thing, and if it wipes, its over. There is no do-over. In a regular raid you rez and go again. On a burn raid you pack it up.<br>
<br>
Now back to our regularly scheduled inanity rebuttal.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ..yet the majority of you still see this as some sort of pissing contest, or my penis is bigger than yer penis dispute between wizards and warriors - Montyy<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
And I am not at all suprised you do. The interesting thing about people is they assume everyone else suffers from the same character deficits they have. Thus a thief is always concerned that other people are trying to steal from him and an honest person rarely is concerned until they are forced to deal with it.<br>
<br>
A greedy person cannot envision that someone else may not be greedy, and moreover it makes them uncomfortable to consider that another person might not be greedy since this spotlights their own avaricious nature. Not pleasant.<br>
<br>
Yet nevertheless not everyone is greedy.<br>
<br>
I will admit a bias to believe other people are also not greedy and perhaps thus have an overly optimistic view of my fellow burners (but i know for a fact many occasions where drops were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> given</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to guild mates and not just by me) but I also recognize you will have a very difficult time comprehending that not everyone is as greedy as you.<br>
<br>
Which makes your whole argument very understandable, though certainly not logical.<br>
<br>
But again for the record I will categorically state I have not sold one SINGLE piece of dragon loot. Not even a spell. Nothing.<br>
<br>
I have been asked to sell. I have not sold. What little I have gotten goes to my guild. Period.<br>
<br>
This is probably unimaginable to you, but nevertheless it is a fact.<br>
<br>
Do I expect all other burners not to sell a piece from time to time? No. May I someday sell a piece that no one in my guild can use? Possibly. But it has not happenned.<br>
<br>

So you are saying if you were a burner you would not burn a dragon to get an RBB or CoF for a guildmate???! What kind of guildmate is that?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Cuz theres no way a mid level guild can compete otherwise. - Montyy<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Get real. Last night was the first burn I have been on in a while and we waited almost an HOUR for all the burners to get there. They had other things going on. They had just burned in a raid or were otherwise occupied. Who knows how long the dragon had been up before that. You saying that a mid level guild can't beat an hour mobilization time?<br>
<br>
The keystone kops could beat an hour. It turns out burners just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> aren't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> available 100% of the time to burn something at the drop of a hat.<br>
<br>
But you will disregard all this, and make more unfounded accusations that I am a farmer. Really I am one of the last people that anyone in their right minds would accuse of that.<br>
<br>
This is about you. This is about what you would do if you had the power to, and it is just totally inconcievable to you that other people might not do what you would do. Despite the fact.. that they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> haven't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> been.<br>

Correct.  It does have a chance.  Its very rare to do so too.  We take out lots of guardians.  Including when our guild was there for 6 days for Callandre's Ragefire.   We killed every guardian that spawned... just didnt get a Sunstrike or Malo.  We kill them other times too, along with Protectors/Tola/Trak and havent gotten them.  They are rare.. and we haven't had much luck at it.  And until we get some copies for the guild we'll be back...LOTS.  Hopefully, we can knock on VPs door soon as well.<br>

Turns out that there was one wizard that was late for the burn, while the others were in the prep room already.  The guild that supposedly got steamrolled was still at the zone buffing, etc.  They saw the one wizard go past them so asumed the mob got ganked when in fact the people who got the kill were already there in the prep room.  Its more of a he/she said kinda thread now so who knows what really happened.  Sounds just like some unfounded bitching from a guild that got beat to a mob. <br>

If this is wrong let me know. As I see it the wizard crew sounds like it was there first. So I don't see how it was unfair.
