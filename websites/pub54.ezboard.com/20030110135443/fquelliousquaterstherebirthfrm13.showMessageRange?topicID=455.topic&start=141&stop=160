Simple fact for me is though people who do that are not my friends.  THEY have to care about the friendship too.  Otherwise its a hollow friendship that really means nothing to them, only to you.  You're apparently willing to sacrifice for your friends.  But if they arent willing to give you the same, then they obviously don't care as much about your friendship as you think they do.<br>

Lets say YOU were screwing people over for personal gain, would THEY remain your friends (even if YOU screwed a friend of theirs?)<br>
<br>
I doubt it.  Not because I think people are hollow, but moreso because it is human nature to protect yourself first, THEN help protect others.<br>
<br>
If all this &quot;heat&quot; was coming down on YOU, MOST of your friends WOULD abandon you.<br>
<br>
again... It is the lack of action, as seen from the outside, that gives the impression that a guild will condone the behavior of it's members. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804>Impudent Blasphemy</a><BR>

<br>
I didn't intend to tell the NToV story again because as tattle said it is too far in the past.<br>
<br>
Gurunt you brought it up like a fucktard hoping it would somehow make you look good.  Kailynn told the story as it actually happened.<br>
<br>
Oh and just FYI most people would agree that NToV doesn't start untill after you get passed Aary.  If you can't pop that cherry you got no business bein there, which you obviously couldn't at that time.  You really think we gave a shit about Iki and Eashen at that time?  That was like our 20-30th NToV Clearing.  Iki/Eashen, while they do have some decent loot, don't compare to the shit you get later on down the road there as you well know.<br>
<br>
My comments were not to rehash that old subject though, they were simply to show how completely full of shit (and yourself) you really are.  How do you expect anyone to put any worth in any thing you say when you can't get explain one single fucking incident without changing some facts to suit you?<br>
<br>
Now I am by no means an angel.  I've been pretty rude to a lot of people in my time.  I've never intentionally trained anyone.  I've never KSed or stolen a camp...well least not that I remember might have been drunk though.  I think the reputation of Lotus Cult stands without equal on Quellious.  Trying to compare Waif to LC is simply ludicrous.<br>
<br>
Everyone knows your full of shit accept your little circle of friends that actually believe you because they are just as full of shit as you are.  <br>
<br>
So the moral of this story?  Keep your fuckin mouth shut if the only thing that pours out of it is...well shit.<br>

There's always ONE missionary who goes in to the cannibals' pot still preaching the gospel to them...  To some folks, no one is ever a lost cause.<br>

Also, there are some folks who depend on the association with the good natured friend to cloak them in some form of legitimacy (&quot;See, Angel likes me?  Why dont you?&quot;).<br>

<br>
When the Uber1 crew is forming for something and they see a group with Uber2 tags zone in, thier shields go up and they assume a defensive posture.  No need really to see WHO is in the gruop, &quot;It's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> their</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> tag, so we gotta watch out.&quot;<br>
These two groups have a history, and they're going to judge the current crew by that history.<br>
<br>
Now, Uber1 or Uber2 are NOT going to react the same way to a crew zoning in flying the &quot;Snow Bunny Hunters&quot; tag.  Partly because they're not the same &quot;teir&quot; and partly becuase they do NOT have that history.<br>

I am sorry for bringin NToV up. <br>
<br>
I should not have brought it up at all, I didn't intend for it to cause problems but should have known better.  I've no interest in continuing that discussion.  My version is as accurate as Kailynn's, we both just highlighted what we wanted.   Which is typical of these conflicts.  Everybody sees themselves as the &quot;good guys&quot;.<br>
<br>
The point (which I obviously made a poor decision to use a real example).. is nobody is pristine, and most conflicts in game are very 2-sided.   When one side sees a raid force somewhere and moves in it's justifiied.   But when that same side is starting to gather somewhere else and another crew moves in, they are being abused by horrible, horrible people.  People feel they can claim a mob with 12 but the other guy can't with 30.  That covers a good 90% of conflicts in game.<br>
<br>
<br>
LC has a great reputation. They have the least conflicts of any guild that's raid-active.  That speaks for itself.  <br>
<br>
I'll take whatever flak is deemed necessary for using a real conflict, however old,  in what was meant to be a neutral discussion.   <br>

(sorry, I know how important it is to keep people from interfering with the quest, but attempting to forbid people from traveling in the zone is plainly unreasonable...it's not our fault Verant made it the hub of Velious.  People need to get to Thurg).<br>
<br>
Aside from the rather over-tense remarks that one or two of them made in said war, I've found the people in LC to be some of the most down-to-earth on the server.  I believe that once a guild grows in size and accomplishments, there's always going to be somebody that wants to sully their name.<br>
<br>
There are exceptions, however.  People who constantly cause grief to other players should be banned from their guild...if the guild wants to maintain a decent reputation.  I won't go into my thoughts on this guild called &quot;New Alliance&quot; or whatever that Obsedianx is a part of.  Anybody that's crazy enough to take up with that cunt is either supremely naive or a glutton for punishment. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kailynn>Kailynn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/7/02 1:17:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=455.topic&index=149>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/goddesskailynn/Gunnm.txt WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guilt by assocation</span><hr size=1> Actually Gurunt i pointed out the bad things about what we did a well.

As to the ring wars I dont know if I was there for that one, but they are extremely tense.  Especially for the person whose ring is on the line.  Its 2 - 3 hours of fighting and one messup can cost the whole event.  My appologies if you felt attacked by those people.  Best thing to do imo is follow the zone walls.  You can get to any of the zones that way and avoid the mess that we call ring wars. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143487">
