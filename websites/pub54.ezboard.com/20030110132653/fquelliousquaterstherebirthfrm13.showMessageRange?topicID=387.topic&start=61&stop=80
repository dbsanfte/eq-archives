We went to the camp to find Charmi sitting there, by herself, telling us that planks were camped. So you mean to tell me that if I want to hold a camp, I'll just send my rogue or chanter up ahead to sit there and call it? hmmm not how it works.  Would YOU have backed off if you went down to planks and found Taim siting there by himself, and only our cleric at the zone? hmm, I really dont think you need to answer that, we all know already <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And Mont, again our cleric died cuz there were 12 people in a spot that is tight for 6,  you yourself said that it was tight cuz you were using your stupid horse to med.

<br>
I've seen quite a few people get pissed when they're on CR and their camp is taken.  I've also seen people get pissed when they leave their camp and replace a member or two and have to fight back down to their camp.  There's people who claim that taking a camp in such a way is within the rules since no one is technically &quot;camping&quot; it when they get there.  However there's also people who claim that it's a pretty dishonorable thing to do.<br>
<br>
I don't really care who did what to whom, I just raise this because of the following... I noticed Montyy made the comment that the people that were taking their camp from them were &quot;vocal supporters of first come first served rules, so I thought it was ironic &quot;.  On the other hand can't you also call it ironic that in other cases you'd expect someone to respect a camp that you may need to cr to or need to replace members for?<br>
<br>
My point is that they've come to the boards and apologized and you've continued to tear them apart over it.  It's really funny that uber guilds are the most criticized for doing the &quot;first come first serve to get whatever camp they want&quot; deal but when you do it back to them you're heralded as some kind of hero.  /shrug you can't have it both ways.  Either you want to play with respect and honor for someone else's camp or you want to play by the &quot;well we're playing within the rules so what's wrong with it&quot; style.<br>
<br>
As you said you never called a camp check and it was pretty obvious they didn't intend to leave the camp completely (charmi was sitting there camping it).  You can make the claim you were within your rights to take the camp since they didn't have sufficient force but if you'd like every encounter to be dealt with in this way well then grats on all the bitching we'll hear whenever someone from Vis/LC/Wraith takes a camp from someone else that may have been on CR or getting new members into the group.<br>
<br>
It's only wrong when ubers do it don't ya know.<br>

The orginal people at the camp were all gone, gone outta zone and gone from game, I checked and none were online, cuz we wouldnt have gone down and tried to take a camp that was on CR.  Charmi wasnt part of the original group that was there, she came after they left /shrug<br>
<br>
As far the whole apology goes, I can hardly call it that now, basically they said &quot;I'm sorry&quot; but added in comments to get over it, and even trying to spin the story so it looks like im some sort of greedy camp jumper that doesnt want to share.<br>
<br>
Once again lemme summarize:<br>
1. Vis group had planks<br>
2. Vis group left<br>
3. My group went to planks<br>
4. Mont and co. got there after us and set up camp on top of us<br>
5. We offer to roll on camp, Mont rolls, gets a bad roll, then imediately says he wants to share spawns<br>
6. to avoid needless aggrevation, my group leaves<br>
7. I came here to vent<br>
8. Mont and Tald try to justify being asses<br>
9. I dont buy it<br>
<br>
This really has nothing to do with uber guilds or not, just a few people who are selfish and lact respect for other gamers in the Quel comunity. <br>

Wasn't there something on this thread that said Charmi was there waiting for VM to leave?  Kinda like getting in line at the grocery store kinda thing?  Soon as VM left Charmi made the call and they got there, not long after you did and from further away at that.  I'd call it respect.  Somebody was patient enough to wait, why can't you respect that?  I'm sure you'd be pissed if you sat waiting for a spawn and i came in there and KS'd it with my &quot;greater force&quot; wouldn't you?<br>
<br>
What you did is what lots of people say the &quot;uber guilds&quot; do.  Might makes right.  You saw one person there and decided to claim it because you were mighty isn't that so?  Did you bother asking Charmi why she was there?  Probably not, or probably didn't want to hear it because you were ready.  Now if they were sitting there and pissing around waiting for the group to get there and minutes just tick away I'd say screw them they had no intention of really being there, but as you said yourself, they got there quick which means they were prepared for it.  Anywhos it's a done deal and can't be changed.  Best to just move on and everybody can learn from it so it won't be as ugly next time it happens ya?<br>

I also sent you a tell in-game and got the reply back something to the effect of &quot;no prob bro&quot; or something like that... If you can't accept what I said originally (which was sincere at the time) and wanna continualy bash me, then yeah... i'm gonna be an ass to you here.<br>
<br>
And in your little list of what happened, you forgot to include that Charmi and our cleric were in the zone at planks when you got there, and they told you we had been waiting on it, etc.<br>
<br>
Basically, you ignored us when we told you we had been waiting on the vis group to leave - but you get all upset when we ignore you... respect does go both ways you know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontyydaogre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montyy Da Ogre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>fat ass</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/12/02 11:11:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Inconsiderate people suck...</span><hr size=1> Nope, just Charmi was there, cleric was at zone.  We woulda repsected the camp had your group all been there, or hell even all in the zone, but this was not the case. We got there first you didnt. Again Mont, would you have respected our camp had just our chanter been there, and only one more even in zone when your full goup was there and ready to go? Noticed you dodged that question before....<br>

I was in Montyy's group that day.  I can confirm that there were only 9 in zone, 7 of which were ours.  I can confirm that of the 2 that were not ours, one was indeed at the zone line, and it was a cleric.  Charmi was at the planks, but she was alone when we arrived.  We had already pulled 2 mobs and were in the process of killing our 3rd when Montague's group arrived.  I can confirm that the space in that small hallways is tight even for 6 folks that are shrunk, and with the other group that was there, I can imagine targeting for mez would be difficult at best.<br>
<br>
The one question that I have in the whole of this thread, is this.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  IF THE GROUP I WAS IN HAD JUST TWO FOLKS IN THE ZONE, ONE OF WHICH WAS AT THE ZONE LINE, THE OTHER AT THE CAMP IN QUESTION AND WAS CLAIMING THE CAMP, WOULD MONTAGUE'S GROUP HAVE RESPECTED THE CAMP???? </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If past experience is any indication of the answer, I think we can safely say that the answer is no, and that is the entire point of this thread.  <br>
<br>
It is done, in the past and through.  Hopefully, something like this will not happen between us again. <p><center><a target="new"href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30880">Rhes Olooshun - 59th Preserver</a></center>

Charmi, why don't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> STFU or remember to use punctuation the next time you extend the life of this thread? Hint: If you want this <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> flame</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> locked on the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> flame board</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> offer to suck off one of the moderators.

<br>
&quot;i do remember rel sitting there for what 48 hours non stop so would that be rel monopolzing planks&quot;<br>
<br>
So what.. and i thought you didn't care about the camp in the first place Charmi? And if your so against &quot;Monoplizing&quot; it why did you group with us for a while there? So we camped it for a prolonged period of time, big deal, thats no reason to use it against us... explain to me how a group of people camping it for a prolonged period of time, has ANYTHING to do with a different group wanting to camp it.. but with the same guild tags.. omg.  You camped shrooms in FG for a long period of time.. YOU ARE SO #)%* EVIL.<br>
<br>
If you wanna bitch at someone monopolizing the camp bitch at Eternal Holiday (no offense to EH btw).. they probably camped it 10x as long as we have. <p><center>
