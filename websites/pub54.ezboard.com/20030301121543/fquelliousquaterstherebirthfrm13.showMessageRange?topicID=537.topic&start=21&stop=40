<br>
One of our members happens to have personal contact (as in, a phone number to reach him at on the go), and we contacted him via that.  We also traded a cell phone numbers and a few more email addresses so that communication lines may stay open a bit more in case of future issues of any kind that face our guild.  I personally gave him this URL to get on via a laptop and post his own defense, since the worth of someone's name and reputation is a worthwhile enough cause to call him.<br>
<br>
For those doubting the veracity of my statements in my prior post, all I can say is that the folks who have known me for the last two years playing have a fairly good idea of my sense of moral and ethical conduct...the point of my post was simply to point out that the Fohtweny a few folks had run into was not the *real* Fohtweny at all, but an impostor.  I came to this site after a close friend brought this URL to my attention, knowing my close personal friendship with Fohtweny and my status as an officer in Knights of Trinity would demand that I take action to start resolving what has been going on.<br>
  <br>
As to my creation date, yes, I had to create a global account with ezboard because, up to now, I had a local account only with my guild board...therefore I never had registered to go on other sites.  I've never felt a particular reason to read through all these boards...the same friend who sent me the URL also happens to send me URLs of the highlights as she's reading them at work =op<br>
<br>
The good rule of thumb and object lesson: don't give your account password out...period.  It is just not a good idea.  The havoc wrought by this entire incident is proof positive.  As of last night, Sevanthian no longer has access to either account, and it is going to *stay* that way.<br>

<br>
In the &quot;Real&quot; Foh's thread, by his own admission, he says he was there during the incident.  &quot;I was present and saw what was going on ...&quot;<br>
<br>
Yet you made reference to him not being available &quot;for quite some time&quot; in your first post, and again in your second post, with these words... &quot;Actually, Fohtweny has been unavailable&quot;.  So I'm just wondering why, if the &quot;real&quot; Foh is not available (and presumably hasn't been able to play EQ) , how he could have been &quot;present and saw what was going on...&quot;?  And if he WAS watching, (playing another toon presumably) and saw the incident, why the hell didn't he do SOMETHING right then and there to stifle the situation and keep his good reputation intact?  Especially when he sees Foh KSing and as he put it, &quot;didn't approve of it&quot;.  And if he WAS watching then obviously he IS available.<br>
<br>
You see, it just doesn't make sense.  It appears to me that either a) Ubunoa is NOT the &quot;real&quot; Foh and is just using the account and claiming to be the &quot;real&quot; Foh, or b) someone is claiming to be both Ubunoa and the &quot;real&quot; Foh and they've managed to get themselves caught in a &quot;page 8&quot; quandry.  I'd be curious to know what the IP address is on some of these posts.  What I'm reading here just doesn't make sense.  Either Ubunoa's post is complete bullshit, or something in your story doesn't add up.<br>
<br>
So which is it?<br>
<br>
Is Ubunoa the &quot;real&quot; Foh?  And if he is, why didn't he step in and stop someone from ruining his rep by KSing when he was right there watching it?  And again, if he is the &quot;real&quot; Foh, why do you keep saying he's unavailable, like he doesn't play right now, when he obviously does?<br>
<br>
If Ubunoa is NOT the &quot;real&quot; Foh, then he needs to admit his post was complete bullshit, take the sure-to-follow flames, learn from it and move on.<br>
<br>
And besides all that, what the hell is a guy like Sev doing using Foh's account?  There's another story in there somewhere and I bet it's full of bs too. <br>

<br>
I would tend to believe Doldrum is not lying, as people are vouching for him and he seems to be making an honest effort to see this resolved.  That makes Ubunoa (has anyone ever heard of this clown?) a REALLY big liar.  Is it possible Fohtweny ebayed?  Or did this guy hack him, or is he a former RL friend who is now jacking his account?<br>
<br>
I'm still confused about some things from your initial post, Acturian.  How do you draw the conclusion that Sevanthian=Fohtweny?  Are you sure that Yirrerar=Sevanthian?  It seems obvious to me that Fohtweny's account has been compromised, possibly by this Ubunoa character, and who knows who else.  <br>

Zak - When you train people in UD you would do well to kill them, not just bring a big pull and die in the process. You know the people that were killing Velk that night just wanted to be rid of you, they didn't need you to train us. <p>Death before dishonor<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=161711">Slasra Cha'kalla</a> - 58th Luminary of Reviviscence<br><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=255278 ">Sskarth Ecrusher</a> - 31st Legionnaire of Reviviscence<br><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163893">Megonna</a> - 50th Test of the Swifttail</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uraenoir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raenoir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/25/02 4:34:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=537.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sevanthian</span><hr size=1> BACK in your Cage LEEZARD!!!!!!!!! <p>Raenoir DuShaine<br>

He <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> banned from Quellious on Sevanthian. He plays Fohtweny a little bit (or a lot as I can see now) but is not the original. He didn't ebay him or anything but I believe Fohtweny is Sev's step brother or RL friend or something like that.<br>
