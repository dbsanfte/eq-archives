<br>
How long does it take your MB team to gather for a kill of Sev?  2 minutes?  Less?  How often must I spam OOC so you will know that a raid is gathering?  Why is it my responsibility to protect my kills from you when you KNOW that you are going to MB, where I might just see a wizard on his way to Sebilis.  What is to stop you from doing this on Ragefire - which is just as easy for you to get to and even more hotly contested.  The &quot;it wasnt engaged yet&quot; BS is all VI is willing to do because they don't want to ban players (and limit profits) for what they consider to be more of a social issue - cant get rid of all the asses, so dont get rid of any.<br>
<br>
Make what excuses you want Mont and FK, you are by your own admission pissing on the rest of Quellious.  Personally, I don't care - I expect wizards to KS at 60 the same way they KSed at 30.  Some wizards are asses, some are not.  I will say that I only know 2 mana burn wizards on the server well, and both have enough class to avoid this type of garbage.  By the Pnp, you can do what you did and nothing can be done in game about it, but dont try and sell &quot;It wasnt our fault&quot; crap here - I for one am not listening.<br>

<br>
Yes Talasar. This is what I am trying to tell you.<br>
<br>
We would have done just that.<br>
<br>
I have in the past.<br>
<br>
I will do so in the future.<br>
<br>
And your use of the word 'another' is disingenuous. There haven't been any cases (yet), and this is not such a case either.<br>
<br>
We didn't see 3 VoR as a raid. Sorry. No we didn't camp check but we had 4 burners when I looked and 5 within a minute after. Neither did VoR camp check.<br>
<br>
I'm saying that if you had said something *I* would have backed down, and I am pretty sure most of the others would have. Mont said he would and I certainly believe him.<br>
<br>
The only real difference in this situation is that a burn team might back down where another raid would not likely do so. Which is good because a burn raid can get there faster. There's probably a connection there.<br>
<br>
The point is we were there first with MORE people. We had a right to the mob. That said, if you had said something, (politely!) we would have backed down. I can't speak for Ferd and Cukak since they had been camping the mob over 12 hours and might have felt differently.<br>
<br>
I have zoned in many times and seen an obvious raid forming for some mob and just left. Naturally.<br>
<br>
I'm not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  apologizing</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for what happenned. We were there first, had more people, and our spotters were there for hours. I do regret the situation however, and I'm telling you one way how it can be avoided in the future. And further offering my help in the future as well.<br>

You had right to the mob, apparently no one made noise about it, MB crews are ALWAYS going to have more people in zone then a raid in the first 2 or 3 minutes.  So MB crews could claim any camp and their right to it anytime they wanted.<br>

Not asking for an apology, I wasn't there.  But if I ever do decide to work on my epic, I would be extremely unhappy to see this happen because 6 wizzies got there first.  Anyway, would prefer to get people to think about what happened rather then get any apology. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>

We <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> there <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> first</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> more</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Why do you think you have a right to something when you have 3 ppl and someone else has 4? To say nothing of the fact that when the 5th arrives the raid force is full?<br>
<br>
No one said anything on either side.<br>
<br>
It's likely neither side even knew the other existed as comptetition at the point when we first pulled. I certainly didn't see 3 VoR as being a possible raid. Although on the other side if I saw 4 sorcerers in zone if it were me I'd have talked up quick.<br>
<br>
It's assinine to think you have to ask anyone to have a mob.. unless they were there <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> first</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. It's called being second. If you are second well you have to do something fast.<br>
<br>
The only difference here is that frequently burners will back down even if they had sufficient force first, if the other party establishes intent, either by obvious numbers (not in this case) or verbally (again not in this case).<br>
<br>
Which policy this whole discussion is making me start to question.<br>
<br>
VoR lost fair and square. They were slower than we were. It's not suprising. What both Mont and I were trying to say is that if you had SAID something or we had KNOWN we would have been good citizens and backed down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> even though we were there first</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
For saying this we get thrashed.<br>
<br>
I guess we could have simply said. 'We were there first, we had raid forces assembled first, we engaged first' and it might have been more understandable to people.<br>

<br>
Sorry the MB team got to Sev before you VoR. My suggestion to something like this would be along the lines of this:<br>
<br>
Raidleader007 types /who all 60 wizard<br>
<br>
Raidleader007 tells 60Wizard005: Hi, my guild, XXX, has enough on to attempt XXX Dragon. Would you let us have a shot please?<br>
<br>
60Wizard005 tells Raidleader007: Sure man, tell us the result at the end.<br>
<br>
This of course, would only be applicable if the guild in question does have a good enough force ONLINE. No good saying 'hi, were waiting for xx members to get online so we can kill xxx dragon'. Thats just not fair.<br>
<br>
NB - every kunark dragon raid should do a /who all 60 wiz, just so that the wizzies KNOW you're raiding. We dont wanna ruin your raid, but were not gonna leave the dragons up for days. Before Manaburn, Gore was up for weeks at a time, and there were 6 or so bard epics on the server. Now look at it.<br>

Last pick for the group, now nagged for translocates waay more than druids (I actually had someone ask for an xloc to WC, was going there with my druid and offered a free ride and got turned down /boggle), and are fragile, mana dependent creatures. <br>
<br>
They plug along and finally get some attention in the 50's from AE groups -- but that's assuming an AE camp's open, they can find and enchanter or two and a cleric and can make the whole thing work. But it's still not glamourous.<br>
<br>
And then after a heck of a lot of blood, sweat and tears they might just manage to hit 60 and plow through the AAXP points and get manaburn. Which is seems to be the big brass ring of wizardry in EQ (that and maybe an epic and a manarobe). <br>
<br>
And all that gets them is grief over killing stuff that almost everybody wants a piece of: the Kunark Dragons. VI has a cruel sense of humour. <br>
<br>
Good luck to you Faith -- hope your efforts to stick to a moral high ground are successful. I've noticed both you and Palazious have been eloquent and patient advocates for your class on the subject. But, between the virtual urban legends building up around MB wizards (my friend's friend's guild was ks'd last week by a MB crew) and the growing number of MB wizzies it's an ugly situation that's been created by Verant. Saints are in short supply all over and the inner pessimist in me (and many others) are just waiting for enough amoral individuals to get wizards up to MB and some real problems begin.<br>
<br>
I don't think it's fair to the Wizard class to nerf an ability that a lot of individual wizards have busted their hump to get. Flip side is that 5 button clicks and dead dragon doesn't hold up to the smell test either. Cap the amount of damage a dragon can take from manaburn to 70% of it's total hp? (That's just pulled out of thin air). Unfortunately I don't see a solution for this that isn't going to be win/lose in the long run. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105663"><B>Aeloryn Dreamsculptor</B></a> Phantasmist<BR>

And in Luclin, wizard damage &gt; all. Armor class on mobs is just too high for any melee's to come close. (MAYBE rangers with AM3 and endless quiver could come close, but I don't know.) <br>

Why do MBers place the burden on raid leaders to speak up? A large force is the norm, the until-hither picture everyone imagines necessary to bring a dragon down. Up until now 3 or 4 wizards in the same zone NEVER set an alarm off in anyone's head, so stop acting like it's always been a commonplace occurance and people should know better because they have no example with manaburn to draw from. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 7/26/02 10:19:59 am<br></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font> <br> <br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
