These people are quite willing too say that its not for guildies or friends just for their greedy selves.<br>
<br>
 I just think you are all pathetic - this is a rare mob with a rare drop that has little use to these people - its hard enough competing with people actually hunting the zone for exp without competing against high level characters who want to complete their wardrobe or some other pathetic reason.  Saying that its VI's fault for making it all/all is also pretty pathetic - VI doesn't make you go to SK to hunt Quillmane - and what about the Mages in your guild that you are ripping off (most people I have spoken too admit that they have non-epic Mages in their guild ).<br>
Im sure that the Mages in Reviviscence would be pretty angry if they were aware that a fellow guild member - Kaesha - an epic holder was hunting Quillmane for the cloak and had no intention of MQ with guild Mages (stated in tells when asked why she was hunting Quill)<br>
Mages are a grossly underpowered class after level 50 and the epic is the only way of getting some balance back - so please if your not a Mage go do something else and leave Quill alone.<br>
For all the people who will flame me I don't care what you have to say - you would be angry in the same position <br>

I completed the third mage epic on the server and I did the whole thing guildless. The Quillmane cloak was even more hotly contested then than it is now (with introduction of Spirit of Eagle, componentless EB etc). I went through the camp. I stayed up 3 days pretty much. I killed 6 Quillmanes (all legs), I lost race to 8 of them (3 had cloaks). I gave up and bought it MQ from another mage in exchange for a Burnt Wooden Staff I had picked up in a group in Chardok. I never blamed the druid, ranger, and warrior who got the 3 cloaks. They have a right to the Right Click Levitate, Unlimited Charges as much as I do. The item is unique in every respect and indeed you should blame Verant. They should have made out quest piece a seperate drop off Quill just as rare so that when someone else kills him they can shout &quot;Any mage here who needs this&quot; instead of the horrid camp it is. <br>
<br>
Live with it, and move on. Your complaint has no substance. Kaesha is one of the nicest persons who plays EQ. It's unfortunate you don't know her better and it's highly unlikely anyone will get upset over her wanting a levitate item.<br>

While I don't have any particular problem with someone camping Quillmane so they have the cloak to use, (I've zipped through S. Karana numerous times to see Quillmane up and not a single magician even in the zone.) I think it's in extremely poor taste to yank the camp from a magician capable of killing him working on their epic.<br>
<br>
And personally, I'm not surprised Wraith supports monkey wrenching others trying to complete their epic since I watched them KS one of their own members on Lodizal yesterday.

<br>
it annoys me how in the example i gave above (white scale) verrant introduced the exact same problem (epic piece highly sought after by others) into the bard epic by adding damage 3 to the cloak. did you see how fast they fixed that? but they can't fix the mage cloak piece? after years of grief?<br>
<br>
i remember after months of complaints and pages of bitching on whineplay abashi stating to just buy it in ec. he was so ignorant of the whole problem he didn't know the cloak was no drop. Then in response to mages asking that quill be made higher level, he responded that mages should've gotten it while they were the appropriate level, of course that's crap since mages are the first class in game to get a componentless levitate and would be the last class to loot the cloak had it dropped in a SK exp group. <br>
<br>
sorry to hear about your troubles masten, mage epic quest is nothing short of a joke. hell most classes epics were made easier before mage quest was ever solved by anyone on any server... feel free to post the name of any non mage who competes with you for it, i'd like to know who it is<br>

I have spent a lot of time there both with friends tracking and solo and most of the time at quieter hours.<br>
<br>
It might be an all/all item - thats a hang over from before epic's were introduced - and Verant maybe should have changed it.  But because VI didn't change it doesnt excuse the behaviour of people - their not holding a gun too your head.<br>
<br>
As for Kaesha - might be a nice person I don't know - I dont care - she is an epic holder and shouldnt be denying others there's <br>

<br>
That was a long time ago.  Now that I'm working on my epic, I see things in a bit of a different light.  I can't begin to tell you how angry I would be had it been my epic piece being farmed by a player who wasn't the same class.  It's hard enough competing with players of the same class for epic mobs (hello, Ragefire!)  <br>
<br>
More often than not, I believe it's personal gain (selling an epic MQ) that drives people post 50 to seek out Quillmane.  Unfortunately, farming isn't going to go away because we want it to.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and in the event I'm wrong about the motives of a non-mage camping Quillmane, you might consider the following first.   <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2482">everquest.allakhazam.com/...?item=2482</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

Or, even ask your friendly neighborhood guild mage for this:<br>

<br>
and then graciously, thoughtfully, considerately ... offer to help with tracking or give up the camp.<br>
<br>

(even though i haven't asked her about it) Granted you both want the item, it's a nice item. But If she didn't jump in on your camp or KS anything from you, I find it hard to understand why you are upset at her.<br>
<br>
I mean, I don't get pissed everytime I see someone killing the Froglok Lord for his Ghoulbane just so they can sell it. I figure, if the cmap is open, it's open to anyone. Now, if someone rolls up and tries to butt in on the camp and lets say this person is a cleric and the other is a mage, then there is an issue.<br>
<br>
An open camp is an open camp. You can't get pissed at someone becuase they want an item too. <p><BR> Ravenark <BR>

I consider it my home away from home.  For ages now I have been running from camp to camp handing out water and food to those that are in need.  It is my time to relax and enjoy the fresh air and mostly the cool rains. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In my time of running every inch of the lush green lands of South Karana... I have killed Quillimane many times... have seen his cloak twice.. all which I searched for a mage in his 50's to give to.. gone as far as sit on the body and /who all mage 50 60 if none were in the zone. This of course before there was a mage in Bound by Honor.<br>
<br>
Now I have a guildmate to hunt Quillimane for... and I have been KS'd a few times.  It is so sad.<br>
<br>
There is so much more to this game then the loot.. there really is.  Of course it feels great to get an awesome item.. but at times it feels just as great to watch someone jump up and down in front of you unable to stop thanking you.  I love making people's days... in a game that can cause so much frustration and anger at times.. it is nice to see the wonderful side of this game from time to time. <p><a href="http://bound-by-honor.tripod.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/boundbyhonor/images/AlleyneSig.jpg" border=0></a></p><b>~.~  51st Ranger of Tunare  ~.~</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uclaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Claver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/4/02 11:47:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=385.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: QQ</span><hr size=1> It's kinda like the thing with casters wanting the Vox/Gore dragon scale for a cloak when it's part of the bard epic.

<br>
Btw there are no Reviv mages worried about this since there are more than enough people that are willing to MQ theirs. I have one on my druid who got it before there were epics in this game.<br>
<br>
Bringing up a persons name and guild on this board is in poor taste. Knowing Kaesha she probably answered all you questions with a smile yet you still chose to single her out here.<br>
<br>
Tristipoo, we don't need another thread that has nothing to do with Wraith to end up as such.<br>

<br>
Masten, i feel for ya man.  for the time being i'd say forget about it since it is causing you so much stress.  when you get the rest of your epic done, i'll pay for the cloak MQ myself, if i don't manage to nail Quill by then.<br>
