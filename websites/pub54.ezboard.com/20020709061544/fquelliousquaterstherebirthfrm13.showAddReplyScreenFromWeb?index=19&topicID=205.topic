<br>
   First off I would like you to know I'm not a jackass, second off I would like to make the facts you stated more clear to the people that actually took time to read your post on a Different topic which oviously shows you need attention...<br>
<br>
1.) Sebilis is a zone where you call your camp evertime you see someone call Camp Check...We did this and claimed Chef. You even admitted you were in Crypt and working your way out. So you sneak out of crypt, into the hall of Chef where you were medding while our group was ready to move in. We moved down to Chef were you guys sit, since we called camp its considered ours by most people. You said you called Chef which Me and Ssasy can tell you thats a dead lie when we sat at zone in watching every camp check. When we get down there and you guys fell pretty stupid sitting near our camp trying to move in all you can say is...we called camp and moved from crypt to here...MY WHOLE GROUPS ACTIONS:<br>
We ignored the fact you guys were being ignorant and past you to our camp, since we had an AE group we trained OUR OWN CAMP in CHEF where you guys followed closly behind and got backlash of our mobs...not smart and you knew it so don't call it training when you run into the train...Heard the Joke of the Dumb dumber and dumbiest Indians? Well i'll tell you:<br>
Dumb went out and shot a deer, brought him on the same day, Dumber and Dumbiest said &quot;oo how did you do that?&quot; Dumb says &quot;I shoot deer, deer stop i bring him home&quot; So dumber goes out and shoots a bufflo comes back in one day others ask how he did it, &quot;I shoot bufflo, bufflo stop, i bring home&quot; So DUMBIEST goes out and comes back with broken up bones and limping, the others said &quot;oo what happened?&quot; Dumbiest says &quot;I Shoot Train, train not stop&quot; ....See my point?<br>
<br>
2.) Using shout in a zone to yell cuss words at me, since i was pulling, and stealing mobs off my train and since you aren't 60 expecting to get 1 single mob off the train isn't very sage on your part. So don't call me out in the zone again for being a dumbass yourself...I'm trying to refran myself from calling you out here since i'm a pretty nice guy and i know this is a public board, but just watch who your talking about and know your story before you say anything...<br>
<br>
3.) Spamming my guild leader isn't going to do anything but get you added to another person's ignore list other then mine...And for your information, my guild leader (droz) did confront me of the situation and i've told him my story, basicly this same one here but in shorter detail...<br>
<br>
4.) Wraith is a good guild and i'm a proud member of it, i'm sure all the members are glad to have me in it or i wouldn't be apart of it. I never saw any of your other group complaining of this matter but you and just so you know an group consists of 6 people, so i was 1\6 of your problem here, why not speak/cuss/spam the other group member's guild leaders? That I dont know and i'm not waiting around to hear about, plz refrain from calling me jackass before you fall into the grave your digging, thx<br>
<br>
worthless - Anyone else got a question?<br>
<br>
ps, I don't know what happened with Wraith/VM but I know we both should move on and just try to stay our of each others way in the future is the best solution to this problem... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uquasquetonfyrestrike.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quasqueton Fyrestrike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Road Kill Cabbie</span><br>  Posts: 137<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(2/26/02 4:02:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To the dumb guy flamming me...</span><hr size=1> ROFLMAO!<br>
<br>
Dude... you really shouldnt have crawled out from under your rock, cause now your ass is mine!<br>
<br>
First off, let's look at the situation as it really happened.  Yeah... we were in Crypt.  We were in recovering a corpse when we heard the ooc the Chef was being vacated.  Chanto ooc'ed that we were intending to take it over.  Never saw anything from you... and since there wasnt much battle spam at the time, I can very safely say that I's have seen it.<br>
<br>
In fact, I do remember seeing about 2 or 3 Camp Checks in a manner of 5 minutes or so... to each Chanto ooc'ed that we were headed to Chef.<br>
<br>
Well... we got Chanto's corpse, and then started over to Chef when another Camp Check got ooc'ed.  This time, you claimed Chef.  Interesting.... ESPECIALLY since you did it from the zone... and we had all but cleared the way there.  Soooo... next thing you know, I see you go running past us and fly into the Chef camp.... and then start pulling.  For the record, we were NOT medding... we were actively engaged in mobs that were in the way.<br>
<br>
As far as shouted profanity goes, nice try.  Well... maybe I did make mention that your mom was a gnome... but I know for a FACT that I immediately apologized (not wanting to insult gnomes like that).<br>
<br>
As far as the trains go.... you were pulling crap from basically everywhere, and pissed off half of the camps in the area.  The best part was that it camps other than mine that were accusing you of trains.  I was just happy to laugh at yer sorry ass in OOC... esp when your cleric bailed on you, and you couldnt find a replacement.<br>
<br>
As far as Droz goes, I sent him a direct tell asking if he had a moment to talk.  He said yes, and I sent him a total of FOUR tells on the affair.  Considering his slothlike intellect, I guess you could term that spam... but since it was my first time dealing with him, how was I to know?<br>

I have not a clue who you are, but seriously the comments you make about (me) Kefkah are pretty childish. If I done something wrong to you or anyone.. it was probably because your IQ was below the general standard in the first place. <br>

Seeing as how you've been very vague in just what has gone on with the Kefkah account it's hard to make any sound judgments on the matter.  <br>
<br>
Are you saying it was hacked for a short period of time and this person had used the account just long enough to go to HoT and screw with its rep there?  Are you saying you bought the hacked account from someone else?  Are you saying that the reputation of having a piss poor attitude from years past was earned but then the account was hacked by someone out to do good (ie yourself or whoever you bought the account from)?  <br>
<br>
Very confusing if you ask me, just like your attitude towards people you feel are intellectually inferior to yourself.  Claiming that anyone with a below standard IQ deserves to be wronged by you is quite a ridiculous point of view.  <br>
<br>
&quot;You told random_GM_01, &quot;but that guy deserved to be trained cuz he's not smart!!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
I've never had a run in with you but after my friends told me about how you/hacker/&lt;insert person you want to blame here&gt;, the brilliant chanter kefkah tried to train them and got no one killed but yourself I had to laugh.  Funny how excuses of being hacked show up now but months ago when it happened no one was around to shed any light on the subject. Well I'll just leave you alone now to come up with a good story to tell in response. =D  Sad thing is I thought I was done with this thread when Desi ended it in a respectable way.<br>

I said that the camp was ours, and you reply was simply &quot;haha no&quot; and you ran past and trained everything in with you.<br>
<br>
Now granted ours wasnt a AE group, we were an old fashion tank/rogue/cleric/chanter group, so we didnt have the luxury of pulling every mob in with us, we had to take the time to clear like regular people, but we were actively clearing to a camp that was unoccupied that we had claimed in /ooc.  Thats camp stealing IMO, period, If we were still sitting on our arses at the zone in, then fine more power to ya, but not halfway there already.<br>
<br>
Also, I realise AE groups need more mobs, but c'mon dont be an idiot.....you guys were in Chef and you were over pulling mobs outa the portal and the D1 hallway....thats just downright rude to begin with, it's not like this was downtime and there were only 12 people in zone, it was Sunday afternoon and there were 40+ people in the zone.  I understand that a lil concept called curtesty is lost to you, but maybe look it up someday and figure it out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for training, it was other people in /ooc bitching about you training them, which is no small wonder seeing as you had so many mobs randomly aggroed on you that aggro going on to other people would be very easy, again I refer to the 40+ people in zone...did you really think that you aggro was gonna NOT go to other people in the zone with that many there? or are you just that stupid? hell, I cast on one frog and ended up getting 6 somehow....I was impressed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh well....dunno why I bother, some people just dont get it I guess /shrug<br>

/em notice desi loves to post everywhere hoping to get ppl on his side and then delete everything say it's best to forget about it when things backfire or doesnt go his way.<br>
<br>
you were hoping ppl to come here pity on you and flame Vis, right? Sorry it didn't work out that way.  Because you provided so many false informations that I don't even think all your guildmates believe in you.  Go to the ADD vs SOTU thread, re-name them to Vis and Wraith and read through them.  hope you feel better.<br>

I didnt lie. I didnt provide false info. The only reason I want this to go away is because this only creates further ugliness, which apparently a lot of my guildmates want to avoid. Nothing's changed in how or others feel about the incident. I might be confrontational in nature but others in my guild are not and I will respect that and am trying to rectify the situation. That's it. I dont need pity or sympathy from you guys. if you knew me as well as I thought you did, you'd know that. I will not be responding further on this issue here or elsewhere.<br>

The whole incident was dumb.<br>
<br>
The 20 minutes to server down made both sides rash, if Vis had asked we'd have likely just given them Myga cuz as was mentioned we didn't have a 60 wiz available.  What happened happened.<br>
<br>
Making it frontpage on our site and here was not needed and is being rectified.  Not like many others past haven't done the same thing.. and it always makes the guy trying to use the soapbox look bad.  I stand by Desi totally, at the time of the incident I felt just as he did.  But it's done and both sides worked it out. Posting publicly was just a mistake made in the heat of the moment, which messageboards turn into a drawn out issue.  <br>
