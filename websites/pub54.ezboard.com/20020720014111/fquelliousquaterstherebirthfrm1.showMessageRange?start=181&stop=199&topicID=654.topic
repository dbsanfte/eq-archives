If you did read the posts on the cleric msg board then you would have seen where we ask for feedback on how to imporve this.  <br>
<br>
With all your criticism, i did not see a solution in your post but rather a rant.  Ranting is easy, creating a solution is hard.  What we have  done is try to create a solution.  Is it perfect? no.  Will it improve? Yes.  But i dare you to find something in this game that is perfect.<br>

I guess this is peer pressure.  This is really the only type of enforcement that anyone can have in a non-pvp environment. What is wrong with waiting a turn?  Lets look at the alternative.  You decide to scratch the system and go for the next rage.  What we would do is flood the zone with people that support the system 24/7 in order to support this system.  There are alot of big name guilds that are supporting this and i bet they would be there to help.  Even more so, are the smaller guilds.  They would be even more apt to flood the zone with their members.  <br>
<br>
Does Honor mean anything to you?  Does respect mean anything?  Because that is what this system is about.  We are here to support one another in any manner that is necessary.  My guilds 100 members will be more than happy to help anyone that is following this system.<br>

Now imagine a sign in front of you instead of that little ol' lady that says, &quot;Be right back in 2 months, maybe more, wait your turn, I'm too busy doing other things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Solutions? I offer none, the list is ridiculous pure and simple.  If a GM has to deal with every single Rage issue from now on atleast we know that person is an authority and not just a bunch trying to implement their own will onto others, because they believe &quot;its the moral thing to do&quot;.<br>
<br>
Again no solutions from all the pro's out there on how to fix 22 people on the list?  What are the rules?  Who is going to enforce it?  Did Quellious turn into a democracy a month ago and I am unaware where I can vote on these &quot;o so important issues?&quot;<br>
<br>
Feadorn you talk about these solutions, I have none, where are yours?  Flood the zone with people 24/7 waiting for Rage? what a novel idea! That would atleast prove who has the desire for their epic - not this line up, drive through, wake me up if it spawns, epic service that is happening now.  I'm sure they would be damn sure to be in zone 24/7 not &quot;come back in 2 month's pls thx! list r0xx0rs!&quot;<br>
<br>
Here we go with this &quot;honor and brotherhood&quot; line. Again I am instantly without either seeing I don't agree with this system being forced down peoples necks.  So VM/LC/Wraith have no honor because they leapfrog each other over spawns if the other is not ready?  Whatever, it's called competition, it is desire to try your best and be your best.  Does it suck sometimes when you are beat?  Sure does!  It is apart of Everquest like it or not.<br>
 <br>
There are a number of people that need to quit trying to create this &quot;utopian&quot; atmosphere in game, it doesn't exist outside my window, I'm pretty sure you're not going to forge one inside a video game.  Play the game.  Play the rules.  Play the challenges that pop up, quit trying to change everything that is hard or you don't agree with.<br>
<br>
If you want some brotherhood head on over the Army Recruitment site or perhaps China would be willing to take you as a citizen.  I'm sure they would be glad to help you.<br>
<br>
I apologize if it seems like I am ranting, however  I still have yet to receive any solutions to any of the points I brought up and many regarding how I should &quot;wait my turn&quot; and &quot;your a F UCKER if you don't&quot; both of which are apart of the problem.  <br>
<br>
Why are you the authority?  <br>
<br>
My mind is open convince me please with viable solutions or alternatives, and not with this rhetoric &quot;it's cause we are brothers, I love you man.&quot;<br>

Karador, your analogy is false and infact you can choose ANY real life analogy and yo will come up short. You do stand in line. Yes first come first serve. BUT what if the person infront of you tells you to hold that spot and then goes away for 4 weeks ( yes the line is 4 weeks long in the supermarket) and comes back to take the spot. You get to stand in line and they dont ? Will that fly ? No. You have to STAY in line and put in your time. All queues are governed by the fact you stay in the line and put your time in. <br>
<br>
Try and go stand in line for some concert ticket for which the line starts 2 days in advance and the ask someone to hold your spot for 2 days and say you'll be back and tell me how it goes. Now extend that to 4 weeks and who knows this will be 8 or 12 or 16 weeks soon. <br>

<br>
 &quot;So VM/LC/Wraith have no honor because they leapfrog each other over spawns if the other is not ready?&quot;<br>
<br>
Well if I am not mistaken, one of the LC clerics in fact did get on the list and did get the epic.<br>
<br>
We ADDer's were almost not going to abide by the list, but in the end we decided to give it a try and become better at server faction. In essence it is better to try and get along with the server community than try to be wankers in the long run.<br>
<br>
I understand what you are saying about competition, but come on, what kind of competition is it for a guild of Wraith's size to just come into a zone and try to gank a camp or mob away from a cleric who was sitting there previously.<br>
<br>
And dont hand me that bullshit about, well folk's should join a bigger or more powerful guild. That is total BS if you ask me to use that line of thought. A person's guild affiliation should not stand to be the determining factor on what they get out of this game. There are alot more folks and guilds who are in favor of this list than against it that we know of. So just learn to play nice and all will be fine.<br>
<br>
I applaud Ivaana's decision to jump on the list, aye i know 21st or 22nd in line really sucks, but in my opinion it's better than putting up with the bullshit that comes with ganking or ks'ing. Also, each cleric on this list have met people from other guilds that wouldnt normally have met, and bonds and alliances have been formed. <br>
<br>
I know this is a rant and I apologize for it, but in essence of guild harmony , i decided to open my trap and say something.<br>
<br>
Beside's, there are alot more important things in life than this pixel laden game, its about the bonds and friendships we form either in real life or on this game that is important to most folks. If you dont think that it is, then you must be one lonely bastard, and should just drive yourself off a cliff and end everybody's agony of your company. <p>Garaddor Ghoulbane

Competition is a good thing... but theres a point where its just plain ugly and not a game to anyone any more.<br>
<br>
While ragefire started out with the gank/first to tag/kite methods it just got way too plain ugly.  Very ugly, it wasnt a competition, it was more of a zerg Ragefire back and forth and try to let the GMs figure it out.  The GMs ended up saying pretty much... work it out or we will despawn Ragefire.  I was there when they said that. ( Ragefire version Shaekee )<br>
<br>
The clerics came up with a solution that they felt was best.  Perfect? not even close, but the majority feels that its the best they have to work with.  The masses of guilds supported their solution.  With ADD joining the support it looks like Wraith is the only descension on the server.<br>
<br>
That is their solution.  You keep asking for their solution but its already being established.  If you want to modify it, then come up with a better solution versus tearing down the whole structure that the servers clerics have built.<br>
<br>
Wait in line Versus Gank is what it boils down to.<br>
<br>
Yes, the line is very long at the moment.  Personally I'd like to see some kind of a way to keep the line in check so it doesnt become a 2 year wait to get a cleric epic.  But I'd rather see a long line then the uglyness that was there before.<br>
<br>
I don't personally have a solution to the 'long line'.  Maybe you could help everyone come up with one without tearing down the whole system.<br>

I don't see people pulling their names off the list, then back on in the same spot, the names are staying on the list infact.<br>
The fact people aren't trying to jump in, would show most people are respecting that the list IS in fact the line.<br>

If I put my name on the list for concert tickets, when I get there, infact no matter who jumps infront of me, I *will* get my tickets because I signed in advance of the concert time.<br>

<br>
Its a mutual understanding that you park your butt there for the cleric that is there in front of you and also during your camp. <br>
<br>
You do NOT stroll in on your appointed day and have 50 peeps standing there to hand you your piece. That is stupid.<br>
<br>
What we do have is a system where people sit their butts down and wait. You don't show up...sure, move someone else into that slot. That only makes sense, and thats what the clerics have been doing.<br>
<br>
The clerics themselves are doing a much better job of handling these issues than the other members of their guilds are so please stop coming in, whipping it out and saying MINE IS BIGGER !!!! All that does is make us realize just how small you are.<br>

Well so be it. No one listens on this forum and I dont know why I expected better. There's still not one guy who cared to respond to why what I propose wont work or how it's not more fair. I wish I had a more ................ receptive audience. <br>

Oh well. It's EQ. I forgot. Anyway, I wont be posting on this topic again.<br>

Part of the agreement is that the next cleric on the list supports the cleric currently camping Ragefire.  That cleric has to be in Skyfire and has to be able to assemble force to take down Ragefire within reasonable amount of time.  Neither of them just walks in on the last day to lay claim to spawn.  They both work together the entire time.  If one of them fails to live up to their end of the bargain then by all means, it would be someone else's turn.  That's like leaving the line.  Nobody is expected to hold your place if skip out or decide to go back for something and the next customer is ready to be waited on before you return.

<br>
Many of the mob hunts remind me of taking a bucket of potato peelings out and throwing them out one at a time to a flock of chickens.  They all run around like mad trying to get that one peeling, stealing, attacking and running over each other for a single peeling.  I play the game for the friends and for fun.  When I am reduced to acting like a chicken to get a piece of equipment, then it's time for me to find a new form of entertainment.<br>

I detest the ks'ing, greedy, backstabbing, I've-got-more-than-you-so-I'm-better-than-you  attitude some people have.  Even a modicum of civility and cooperation is quite refreshing for a change.<br>

<br>
This was never meant as a list where you merely post your name at the bottom and then show up on the day when your Ragefire is due to pop. This is simply not true. It is also not expected that Cleric #20 must sit 24/7 on Cleric Hill and assist all those in front of him/her. <br>
<br>
What is expected is, that as you turn draws near that you start assisting more and more. If all clerics continue upon this path I see no reason why this system cannot continue. <br>
<br>
I held watch through 3 clerics in front of me. I had guildmates and friends spell me while I went to work and slept. The clerics keeping the watch directly behind me would stand in while I would take a break. At each Ragefire spawn there were at least 30-50 people in zone within 20 minutes.  The people were from all the Guilds who were keeping the &quot;watch.&quot; It is this cooperation between the various Guilds that makes this system possible. And I have no doubt that it will continue. <br>
<br>
Until VI sees fit to reduce the waiting time for Ragefire I see this as the only viable way of sustaining some semblance of honor and civility between all the Guilds in Quellious. <br>
<br>
Feadorn was present when I was the &quot;sitting cleric&quot; atop Cleric Hill and now his turn  has arrived.  The clerics in attendance now, as well as those who have gone before, will all assist him with his quest for his epic battle.<br>
<br>
I wish you well Feadorn and also to all the clerics presently participating with this &quot;Ragefire Watch.&quot;<br>
