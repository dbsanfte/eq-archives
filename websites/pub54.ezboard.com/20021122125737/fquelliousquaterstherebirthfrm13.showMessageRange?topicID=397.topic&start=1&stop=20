Tips? Just plain good reading maybe?</span><hr size=1> Ever wonder what devotes a scammer to do what he does? Be it an account or some petty item scam in EC. Some say its the greed. While others say its the matureity factor of the acne faced 13 year old behind that computer desk. Few know the real reasons why they do what they do. The reason they do it is pure and honorable. The sole purpose for any cona rtist/scammer is for the challenge. It seems it is also the same in this fake reality we call EverQuest.<br>
From the begining of time there have been the bad apples of the bunch. The outkast that no one wants around. The ugly duckling everyone pokes fun off. This my friend is your typical Everquest scammer. They have stabed so many people in the back they have forced themselfs into a dark corner. While in this dark corner there is no one but themselves. They are revolted by normal patrons of the game. Even the &quot;noobies&quot; despise the dispicabel scum we call scammers.<br>
When someone looses htheir account or items from their account they usually instantly go around advertiseing they hav ebeen hacked. 99 out of 100 of the times this happens it is from scamming and not hacking. <br>
Shall I define scamming for you? The art of scaming is the process in which you manipulate or use what we like to call social engineering to get something that you want. Be it for the greed or for the challenge.<br>
Ah the great art of social engineering. The term &quot;if theres a will, theres a way&quot; best suites the term social engineering. This simply is just geting other people to do your work for you. With just mere words you can bend a person into beliveing anything. With just a few solemn words you can make them do your every bidding. Is this a skill that can be learned? Sadly no. You either got it or you don't. I will go over a classic exampl of social engineering that I have seen work time and time agian.<br>
I call this the &quot;Ladder Branch&quot; technique. It is where you obtain the account information to one account and use that account to branch out and get others. Example. You have been in a guild for a litle over a month. You start to gain alot of the members trust and loyalty. So you scamper over to one of your new friends and ask them to share accounts with you. Ofcourse them being niave like most of the Everquest community is they will GLADY just hand you the info to their account over. Sound to easy? Try it and be amazed of the stupidty. Once you have acess to the account log onto it ASAP. This part may take a bit of research but it will be worth it for extra loot. First you need to find out the persons &quot;best bud&quot; in game. Soon as you have done so then you send them a tell once you are loged on to the account you already have gotten, and ask them if they would let you use their account for a bit. Some common things I find work alot are &quot; Hey I've never played xxxxclass before, mind if I try your xxxclass?&quot;. Or &quot; Hey I need your xxxclass to help me with xxxthing, mind if I use him sometime?&quot;. Sounds stupid ya? Well be amzed when this litle trick works. Wow so far you have two account? All you had to do is..type a few sentances and log onto Everquest a few times? Not bad so far? Now just keep branching out those account from the friends of the accounts you get. You can get DOZENS of accounts like this if you learn to master this technique and practice your reasons for useing the targets account.<br>
Next ace in the hole we will talk about will be the ever popular phone call scam. It is when you call up targetX and simply parade yourself off as someone else in order to get their info. You might be thinking..people are to smart for that, well think agian. Here is a nice example I once used. Sorry for the use of te names, but heh lessons need to be taught right? this example is a true account of what happened. All names are true.<br>
Well me and my friend Greg Knight decide to team up on this upcomeing project he has approached me with. We somehow caught wind of some precious Lotus Cult members section information on their messageboards( Thanks Jesibelle!). Well looky here they just happen to have a list of half the guilds real life names an phone #s. Now that we had the tools it was time to go to work. So pick a few names out of the list. Colach and Arreanors named poped out of the list of many. Jesibelle also gave us some information to her ex-lover, Wyen. Such as his real life name,age,parents etc etc. So I tihnk to myself a bit and planed it out. Then we were ready to execute the plan. So we give Colach a ring. He answers and I parade my self to be Josh (Wyen, an officer of the Lotus Cult). Being 14 years of age the younge colach eaisly bought into my social engineering dialouge that went something like this. &quot; Hey bud its Josh here, you know me as wyen on everquest. Well to get to the point, I need a good monks account info handy just incase something is up and we need a puller for it, and we voted on you for the monk for the job.&quot;<br>
Let me point out a few things. When I siad &quot;we voted on you&quot; That just flatters him and helps him buy the scam that much more. We chose to target Colach for the sheer purpose of his age. Well it didin't take much for the litle bud to hand over his account info.<br>
Then we moved on to the ever popular Everquest player Arreanor AKA- Carlos from Texas. This one was just that much easier. I call im up and simply tell him we are collecting Lotus Cult members account info for &quot;just in case&quot; emergencys. Sure enough he hands it over. One heart one love right Carlos?<br>
Sounds to easy right? Well right you are it is that EASY. It surprises even me how niave people are of all ages.<br>
I get alot of questions about such things as &quot; How do you jakc the items of an account and still keep them? Won't the GMs just take them.&quot;<br>
Well my answer to that is &quot;not if you do it the right way&quot;.<br>
The right way was not ane asy thing for me to find. Three accounts banned and a few friends down the hole. Eventully I found the way. Just becuase I could careless I will gladly share it with you all! Youw ill need a total of three accounts to pull this off. The account your jacking and two dummy accounts with a few small items on them each. First you use dummy account1 to auction WTS item01. Then you send dummy account1 a tell from the account your jacking saying &quot;Hey I'll trade you all these uberitems01 for that item01.&quot; Then simply reply with a simple yes on the dummy account1. Then do the transfer. Then rinse and repeat with the other dummy account to the other dummy account. This way they GMs will be forced to rollback the account that was jacked and can not take the uber items 01 away from dummyaccount02 simply becuase it was alla legit trade. They have no basis to take items away from people who traded for tem &quot;honestly&quot;.<br>
Well thats all for now folks, but await more of the saga from Casey Croft- Scammer extroidnare<br>

Yay! Another failed upbringing. I'm not sure this story is true, but you can try me for a challenge and see what happens.<br>
<br>
P.S. Con artists don't lift a finger and push a spec of dust for the challenge. They're simply too lazy to earn anything themselves.<br>
<br>
P.S.S.

Have fun on Quel getting booted from guild after guild. Hope you had fun ninjaing aow as well.

If you're going to announce yourself as this great scammer why don't you try hiding your identity a tad better.  Seems I win, you lose.  Seems there are quite a few people you've scammed who would kill for that information.  Seems you're going to be looking over your back quite a bit.  Seems your dad (John) has already had a nice convo with quite a few people already today.  Seems you are a complete and total fucktard who has been nothing but owned by the friends of these people you were oh so smart enough to scam.<br>

And say what you will, Casey, what you did was not honorable. You abused someone's trust (and in the LC instance, the trust of the entire guild) to get accounts. You outsmarted no one; you simply lied and manipulated your way in to their confidences, and then shattered them.<br>

This doesn't really seem legit, guys..  The poster didn't even try to conceal his identity.  He did everything BUT include the whois info from the domain, jakenkc.net.  This looks like a set-up, maybe someone who knows the guys who maintain www.jakenkc.net.  <br>

Tips? Just plain good reading maybe?</span><hr size=1> I've taken that completely into consideration but posted the info anyways.  I personally don't think someone would go through the effort of setting up a completely bogus website more than 2 months in advance using someone else's contact information.  To load his signature onto the site he has to have access to the server his domain is hosted on.  There's also racist remarks on the site and even if it's not really him I hope whatever sick individual would put up a site like that would suffer just as much.  I think the boy is just naive and screwed up but I don't put it past him to &quot;frame&quot; someone else. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=397.topic&start=181&stop=195>10</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=397.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=397.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=20><img src=http://quellious-collective.com/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=397.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=397.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=397.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=397.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm23">Archives-General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm24">Archives-Flames</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.91<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
