Do I tank?  Hell no.  I occasionally get in the way and soak some hits up to keep the cleric alive 'til the tank can regain aggro.  You better believe I'm not nukin' or swingin' back though, I want that aggro OFF of me!<br>
<br>
3.  Healers of any flavor that think it's a good idea to start healin' the puller when the puller's only half way back to camp.  Congrats, you just gained aggro, and now the tank's gotta chase XYZ mob around.  You DON'T need to keep a puller's or tanks life bar maxed out!  They've got more hp's than you fer a reason.  Take a chill pill, med, let 'em get beat on 'til they've solidly established aggro, then have at it.<br>

Barm's Tips for Melee Management <br>
<br>
There are times during your career as a shaman that you'll find yourself grouped with those crazy melee type classes. I offer the following tips for working with the gate-inhibited: <br>
<br>
Melees are poor at math and don't understand that 20 mana is less than 100 mana, thus they keep pulling. You can help the tank visualize your mana bar by keeping his health bar at the same level. Some warriors cannot comprehend this either and pull anyway. This is called natural selection. <br>
<br>
Paladin get a very annoying ability called Lay of Hands that they carry around like a personal get out of death free card. They will happily pull Venril Sathir to your right courtyard group confident that LoH will save the day. It's imperative that you &quot;fizzle&quot; a few heals, forcing them to burn this right away. Now, your group is relatively safe from your pally for one game day. <br>
<br>
Monks get a similar ability called Mend. They tend to be more selfish in its use, so make a hotkey saying “Monk, please cast MEND on %t.” and click it every two minutes. If they try to claim they can’t, tell them your brother’s 16 monk can Group Mend. Then accuse them of being ebayed. <br>
<br>
Tanks think all casters med at something like 500 mana a tick. When you report your current mana they, despite being poor at math, mentally tack on another 30% to compensate for .003 second delay your message spent traversing the internet. To correct for this, subtract 30% from all mana reports. This is called the &quot;Scotty Principle”. <br>
<br>
Rogue twinks are your enemy. They join the group with 15 hit points left dual wielding 10/10 weapons that proc Insidious Taunt and immediately demand haste. You cannot afford to heal rogues. Give them something with a boot icon -- Scale of Wolf for instance. <br>
<br>
Many people do not understand the Ranger class and think they are like that dirty, unshaven guy from Lord of the Rings. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Rangers actually follow very strict principals of honor like Shaolin priests. Under their Bushido-like code, nothing brings more shame than being healed by another. Pat Morita explained this all at the last Fan Fair. He did say they were kinda dirty. <br>
<br>
Keep your pet alive over all other group members. You can justify this by explaining that your 55 pet costs 50 mana more than Reviviscence. Be warned, they will try to confuse the issue by pointing out that you can’t even cast Reviviscence. Go into a long dissertation regarding the concept of “community mana” and the respect thereof. <br>
<br>
If melees ask for strength say something like, &quot;Yeah, that would be sweet -- maybe this drolvarg will drop it?&quot; [Optional] Then cast Maniacal Strength on your pet. <br>
<br>
Some shaman suggest casting buffs on yourself or you pet as timers so you know when to refresh. While this may sound good on paper, it does not factor in the warrior who clicks off each buff every few minutes trying to check the names. <br>
<br>
Don't get angry at the tank who responds to your &quot;OOM&quot; with &quot;haste plz&quot;. What they really mean is, &quot;Hastily get thyself to the zone while I buy you precious second with my unworthy life's blood, Good Priest.&quot; It's just hard to type all that between the crunching sounds. Respect the dying request of this proud roleplayer.<br>

<br>
I may not be a tank in the true sense of the word, but I believe with 3500 HP and almost 1100 AC, I do pretty well.  That is my own buffs and cleric buffs, nothing outstanding.  <br>
<br>
Something you will have to get used to is this: The spells you will have to use post 50 gains aggro!  There is no avoiding it.  You can control it to some extent, but it's unavoidable in the end.  <br>
<br>

<br>
I defer to your greater experience, Kumadarra, but this is my experience.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I clouded my point within my rant above; the &quot;tankin' shaman's&quot; I refer to would be the ones that actively try and tank (hell, I've heard a few Shammy's claim they can out-melee a rogue, &quot;if only they didn't have backstab.  Bah!)Gainin' aggro through Slows, Malo's, DoT's (if the 'chanter doesn't mind, or you don't have a chanter), and Incapacitate/Cripple, and the higher versions of these lines WILL gain you aggro.....  does it do any good to sit there and try to tank that mob?  Only if it's an add that was after da cleric or caster.  <br>
After you're sure the fight's goin' well, is it ok to stand up and pokey-pokey Mr. Bad-Ass-Barny-Monster in the ding-ding a few times?  Sure, as long as you got enuff mana fer the next pull, which should already be halfway back to yer camp by now, if yer in a good group.  <br>
As fer doin' the canni dance.... maybe it gets easier after Regrowth and Canni III come into my spell book, but fer now, I do the Canni dance, and med, and pokey-pokey when I hafta.  <br>
<br>

That help clear it up?  I've never had a way with words, sorry.<br>

<br>
Most classes undergo a lot of minor to major changes in gameplay after they get in the 50's, just like when they break into the 40's.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sometimes when I hang out with my (until VERY recently) under-50 buddies I often forget how many buffs/spells/tactics I take for granted at 60 are simply not even an option for them yet.<br>

Yes, Wulf that does make your point a little more clear.  And I do admit, I forget how different things are pre-50 sometimes.  Please forgive me.  Cann and Chloro can be pretty effective still.  <br>
<br>
As for outdmg'ing rogues with melee? lol, well I could but only if the rogue was lvl 10 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I can outdmg a rogue easily with spells..and do tend to keep aggro on me when duo'ing with a rogue.  Makes their dmg higher.<br>
<br>
I think the lvls between 45 and 50 should be a training period of sorts.  You'll start grouping in higher lvl places where slow is needed.  The mobs will hit you and if you haven't already, you learn to deal with the aggro.  I have seen shamans of this lvl cower in the corner when this happens!  That comes from too much circuit xping..you know the one...LoIO, FM, OT, DL... Shamans are good solo, but they excell in groups.  That route to 50 doesn't teach much, I'm afraid, about the post 50 situatioin.  Anyway, a little OT there hehe.  I will shut up now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwooweewoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wooweewoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(3/25/02 3:54:12 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Random garbage</span><hr size=1> i beat moho in melee duel~ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ujurorb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>JurorB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tall, Dark, and Hairy</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(3/25/02 3:54:45 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Random garbage</span><hr size=1> The way I see it, a shaman's primary role in group or on raid post 40 is to buff and debuff.  We can do lots of other things - heal, dot, nuke, use pet (as long as it's properly trained), and even melee.  But those are secondary roles.  Don't start tanking then decide maybe you should have slowed the mob first (seen shamans do that... bad mojo)  Always look at your group and what it needs then decide what else you are going to do when you have the mana.  There are times when not only is it OK for shaman to melee but the shaman actually should step in and use melee skills (why else you would have 1HB, 2HB AND piercing, dodge, defense... you did master them, didn't you?)  Same goes for casting offensive spells.  You better believe I am going to nuke mob for 655 or dot it for 1200 if I know that I can get away with it.   <br>
<br>
Even if you wait until tank says he has aggro, you are going to get on the mob's hatelist.  Sometimes that means that you will get summoned and pounded on.  Hiding in the corner will do you no good.  As a matter of fact, sitting down is usually the worst thing that you can do.  At that point you have a choice, back off a little and let someone else try to take aggro or stand there and fight.  Personally I give the tank a chance to taunt but if I know I am going to die (and believe me, there will be times when you are clearly doomed), I want to go down swinging.<br>
<br>
Medding is less efficient than using regen and canni.  Only time I really sit on my butt is when others take med break (why should I cannidance then sit there and wait) or when I am helping lead raid and need the time to do something.<br>
<br>
All shamans have to decide for themselves post 40 whether they want to be battle shaman, healer shaman, or mix of the two.  There are numerous debates on AC vs. WIS gear on shammy boards so I won't bore you with that.  Pick what you want to be and be the best at it that you can.<br>

The life of a shaman changes drastically throughout the levels. <br>
<br>
In my life pre-30, I did a lot of tanking, healing, buffing, dotting, etc. My ac was good, I had a good weapon, and if we had another shaman in the group and another healer, I would stand up there in Lake of Ill Omen with my Ogre War maul and do almost the same damage as the tanks. I was able to do many things all at once in South Karana at the spires. My strength was that I was versatile. I could buff, heal if necessary, ghetto mezz, DOT a mob quickly to claim aggro from the enchanter...etc.<br>
<br>
During my 30's, I was primarily a healer, even though life sucks before Superior heal. The damage being done by the tanks far surpassed my own, and my mana was best spent on healing and buffs. I did spend a few levels tanking with a druid, but I was insanely buffed and that was not the norm.<br>
<br>
In my 40's I learned to deal with groups that wanted everything from, on a limited supply of mana. I only meleed when I was full mana and no one needed heals, or I was the buffer, not healer, and had time on my hands.<br>
<br>
Now I am in my 50's and I can NOT melee worth a damn. while I am a master in 2 melee skills, I just can't hit the mobs we fight now. I can occasionally hit the giants in Kael for *gasp* 30 points. I can get aggro easily (gotta love slows) and frequently get the crap beat out of me. One good thing that came of me meleeing at a young age long ago, and getting beat on during all my levels, is I can take a hit, I can Channel thru most damage and still get that slow off, or that crucial heal.<br>
<br>
I am a buffer, I am a non melee damage dealer, I am a debuffer, I am a healer. I am strong not because I am better at any one thing than another class (buffs not included), but because I am well rounded. I have been given the tools to be useful to many people in many different situations, and because I am really a pure caster now, but have been blessed with the AC and hitpoints and strength to stand up to mobs. I don't drop to most foes immediately before tanks can regain aggro, and if I can live just long enough to get one more heal off...my job is done. <p><BR>

 <br>
I think the best way to play your class (as long as your hybrid, with some exceptions) is being versatile and playing the strengths in whatever seems to be needed most.<br>
In fact thats what I loved so much about playing a class like Shaman, the versatility...the decision.<br>
<br>
I feel all those that say you need to play this way, or play that way are just stupid, mmmkay? <p><BR><img src=http://sachem.freewebspace.com/images/sach2.jpg><BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usfemwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>S Femwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 3/26/02 1:09:56 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwulfgyrdracokyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wulfgyr Dracokyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.psynical.com/17anidot1b.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(3/26/02 6:52:13 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.psynical.com/WulfyFace.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Random garbage</span><hr size=1> /laugh Sachem<br>

point taken, m'lady<br>
<br>
I solo'd &quot;old world&quot; up 'til around 43, 'til I moved to Luclin fer a bit on this damn twilight sea scavenger huntin' quest.<br>
<br>
1 word 'bout stuff in Luclin (Scarlet Desert, Mons letalis, mostly):  undercon.  <br>
<br>
Had a greenie-beanie mob take me to 1/2 hp's 'fore I knew it (proc 130 hp DD on my ass twice, was doublin' fer 50+, OUCHIES).  I'd heard of stuff like that happenin' from some of my higher level friends, but that was the first I'd had it happen to me.  <br>

4. See number 3, substitute nukers that like to blow XYZ nuke off at the mob while it's bein' pulled. See that stain on the KC wall? That's the last dumbass that did that.<br>
___________________________<br>
<br>
Piss off hippy!  I ALWAYS click my Assist Key and start nuking as soon as I see the puller coming to camp.  Once I get aggro, I scream and run all over the place.  This is NOT a random act of cowardice or stupidity.... it's caring and devotion to all those fat bastid tanks I gotta stand behind.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry... but have you been living in a cave or something?  Take a long look at the ogres and trolls bro.  They're HUGE!  That just ain't healthy at all.  I make em run around to help keep them healthy.  Have you even seen a fat bastid ogre topple over from a heart attack?  It's not pretty... and I wont even get started on the proiperty damage that the tremors cause....<br>
<br>
Quit being a selfish noob, and start looking out for your fellow fatties.  Nuke/tash/slow/CH early... and then run allllll over the place!  You MAY just save a fatty's life!  <p><center>

<br>
turn on Luclin models, it's easier (and less hazardous)<br>
<br>
I did get a kick outta that though.  hehe.<br>
