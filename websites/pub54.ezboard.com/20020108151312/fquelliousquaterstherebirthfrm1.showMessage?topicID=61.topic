I regret and it sorows me but its time for me to move on.<br>
Everquest as not done me any good lately, I was unable to attand raids cause they where guild members only, Wraith , Lotus Cult and Vis Maior have refused even my trial period to join them, and the guilds i have worked my ass for Knights Crusade and Pretorians did not go as they where planed too, and also was my great pain that one of these guild have members who litterly hated the guts out of me cause i left and after some time applied to a guild.<br>
I all time i played eq last few months i was never after Exp and niether loot, all I wanted is to raid and be in big groups and close frinedship with members of the guild and see gods, dragons and uber mobs drop one by one, see guild members cheer as they acive there goals of Epic quests.<br>
I spent months working for others, and was also the only person who from August and January manage to lead raids and  kill vox and Naggy, but when it came to me have the fun i was refused to this I guess people forgot the pain and time i spent to help them but this does not really be important.<br>
Also atm I have a very bad time in real life, a family argument has brough me to move out of my fathers house, so i lost a place to live, my car , my job , and my internet time, not to say that my girlfriend is not realy bothers about it iether.<br>
To all the friend i have made I give you all a very special farewell hug especialy to these people  <br>
Xanox, Kenuw, Tanye, Arise, Trinadi, Lakars, Raluvin, Catminx, Banelion, Spellquester, Fder(valiance), Gewain, Bokain, Blushield, Gardile, Celeloth, Laughter , Sizare , Gunycke , Gunsoul, Drevis, Lanla, Anri, Fenroon, Trilian, Gudbash ,Soulreviver, Merlin, Alsy, Lorek, Matadus, Giostur, Edrahil, Pantera, Sharac, Myyan, Drakinn , Buggette,Daarkwood, Ryhoki, Helm, Gypsum, Havusin, Tunset, Malla, Lutosbloom, Lyten, Paeg, Andiana, Anadian, Stefy, Poper,  well and to all others i really cannot get to name all <br>
An extremly SPECIAL thanks to and a massive huge hugs go to vandyana, Kinini, Tamika, Ariella(Ariellina), Levina and Catminx <br>
who gave me load of moral support in the past months when i lead riads and the guilds and all the fun.<br>
To those who hate me when today you smile you got what you want you see Trex leaving, guess a huge realf, but tommorrow you cry cuase i would not be there to be hated no more.<br>
To all of you i hope you get the fun i had when we where first to ever charge vox or naggy to be in the planes and all the massive fun.<br>
I miss you all i miss Eq in the old days i miss it.<br>
And to close this up last night I was on a Vox Raid with a few friends and to our bad luck the raid failed and Trex was last seen charging on Vox shouting Glory to all, but he disappeared with a vox from Vox saysing. <br>
I WILL NOT KILL YOU, BUT I WILL BANISH YOU. BANISH YOU FROM EVERQUEST. <p>~Trex Goldenknight~<BR>

<br>
I don't know what to say.  You started Knights Crusade with a good vision.  You kind of pushed folks to achieve.  You ran raids on Nagafen and Vox which had their set of wins and losses.  You got too big for the guild and decided to leave Knights Crusade and the people who had felt you were a pretty decent leader.  Of course, you left Knights Crusade under the pretext that you were taking some time off.  And the next day, I get sent about five or so emails pointing me to your applications into various guilds.  You didn't get into the uber guild of your choice, so joined Omega and then Praetorians.  Now you are leaving again.<br>
<br>
I could be quite venomous in my response to your leaving, but what would it accomplish.  Several people who really looked up to you were upset when you left Knights Crusade but learned true hatred when they found out you applied to the other guilds the day after.<br>
<br>
I don't really think you are leaving (because I believe I have heard this type of thing before).  I think you are probably just starting other characters and possibly going to another server.  All I have is a bit of pity because this seems to be another attention-getting ploy.<br>
<br>
I can't help but notice that a couple of people are not on your list of farewells....Cadfiel and myself for that matter!  I seem to remember Cadfiel and I camping Upper Guk with you to gain Ghoulbane, I seem to remember us both also being there while we worked for Mistmoore Granite in Mistmoore for Armor of Ro...I seem to remember us both on our FIRST guild raid in Befallen.....to name a few things that we did together....yet our names are curiously absent.<br>
<br>
All I can really say is good luck (as I wished you when you left Knights Crusade).  I have no advice to offer because it was rarely heeded in the past anyway.  Regardless, you still have my best wishes no matter what...if you need help, you know my email address, my friend.<br>

I remember you giving this farwell speach a few times already. I remember you on a fire giant raid with a few freinds looking a item by mistake. I remember you leading the euro planes raids, where it was pretty much almost all fear raids. I remember you stop doing it after you got your final peice of planes armor. I remeber you telling your guild you were taking a break from the game, then posting on Vis boards stating that you wanted in there guild.<br>

I should probably stop here, but instead I&quot;m gonna go on.  Increasingly more often, there isn't just someone leaving, but more and more often, it's Trex leaving.  I don't know you personally, but I think this is the third time you have come to the quellious board and announced your departure.  That in itself is not surprising, people leave eq all the time and at least half of them come right back.  What IS surprising is that each time you leave, lots of people seem shocked and say all kinds of stuff about how they are sad to see you go and all these things.  While I'm sure you are a great guy, you have a very good reputation, as I said I don't know ya meself, I think saying something along the lines of see you next time would be more appropriate. <p><html>

The reason for this is your reputation with most people.<br>
<br>
For the Fear/armor things. If you are going to take response ability for a raid then yes, however you took it for ONLY personal gains. You were able to make sure that you got on the raids you wanted. You were able to pick the amounts to which planes. It was greed plain and simple for what you did. and everything that I have seen you do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uyezudstygia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>YezudStygia</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mister XX</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/12/01 5:36:25 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Farewell to all everyone.</span><hr size=1> You don't know him Thay <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ....did u see Trex with Fiery Avenger?....mhh no.....<br>

And also thanks for telling anyone who doesn't agree with the way you lead raids to f*** off, it shows real maturity. Oh, and I did keep leading fear raids after I had all my armor solely to help others get their armor and because they asked me to. Nagafen raids too for that matter...<br>
