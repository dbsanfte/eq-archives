<br>
As an aside, and for those who might be technical purists, this thread is an example of the Fallacy of Composition - an erroneous reasoning of part ot whole. In other words, the idea that the actions of one person may be accurrately ascribed to every member of their social circle is a fallacy of composition as it ascribes the actions of one to the actions of all in a blanket fashion.<br>
<br>
Another fun fallacy we see here is the Fallacy of Shifting the Burden of Proof. Any person making an accusation assumes the burden of proof by virtue of making the accusation. When said accuser finds his task to weighty to prove, the easy way is to attempt to fallaciously attempt to shift the burden of proof to his opponent. And example of this would be...<br>
<br>
Person A makes wildly improbable accusation against person B<br>
Person B refutes it handily.<br>
Person A responds with the line &quot;Well, it's quite obvious that I'm right, and if you disagree, prove me wrong!&quot;<br>
<br>
We won't even go into specifics or the various other Fallacies of Equivocation seen here, but your friend will no doubt find some enjoyment picking out the many lovely examples of argument gone horribly awry.<br>
<br>
(Still I agree with the idea of guilt by association in the singular aspect that a truly distasteful action by a guildmate would certainly give me pause to question my continued membership should the officer cadre not respond) <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

I reply directly to what you *say* Fkin.<br>
<br>
Most of the time it's not rational.  You don't think before you speak, and vague rhetoric doesn't prove any points, man.<br>
<br>
Yes I say it's a misunderstanding a lot, it usually is.. odd tho when LC or Vis, or Explicit, or the Alliance, or ADD, or Rel do shit it's lies or perfectly justified, because they deserved whatever toys more than the other guys.   I'm sure the truth is since we all do the same stupid stunts at different times, we all either miscommunicate or we all are just fucked up assholes.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm the only one that thinks &quot;gee, when my team gets caught doing something fucked up, I know firsthand our motivation isn't just to screw the other guy, usually it's miscommunication or just 2 sides not willing to back down.... maybe, just maybe... when the other guys do fucked up things.. maybe they aren't out to get me&quot;... <br>
<br>
NAAAAAH!   When we do it it's perfectly justified.. it's all you other assholes doing the same shit that are the bad guys!  That sound about right?  That's the the general consensus here.<br>
<br>
<br>
What facts do I ignore?  That the other MB wizards are completely clueless or in on the act?  That DB doesn't know or won't say where their camp was?  That Pala in his own words says he talked to manteca, responded in agreement, yet never agreed?  What other facts are there I am not aware of, or  are not vague or hearsay?<br>
<br>
<br>
I think this word fact, it's meaning is not what you think it means.<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact is that I talked to people in game about this on both sides (all who were available and willing to), and listened to both sides inclucing the flame boards... the fact that nobody else has done jack shit to resolve this but Lalian talking to me, and Jama...well, that doesn't matter does it?  <br>
<br>
<br>
If talking to the DB people, talkign to Jama, and listening to mindless flames are NOT what I'm supposed to do,  what am I supposed to do?  Here I was hoping to find some more DB people online tonite, but obviously Fkin thinks that is counterproductive and since my already talking with those that I could is proof I don't want this resolved, trying to talk with them more is just more proof!<br>
<br>
<br>
Finding out some kind of timeline, and where the DB camp was isn't going to help, is it?  That would be logical!  That might put some solid sense into what happened!  That would be a very anti-Fkin kind of thing to do!<br>
<br>
<br>
I know I'm gonna get flamed on a flame board.  Flames are harmless, and baseless, and pointless.   They are insignificant.  They are your forte.  I deal with people, directly.   That is the core difference with you and me.   I resolve (as best I can) issues with people..... you create and prolong issues (as much as you can) with flames.  <br>
<br>
Don't believe me?  Tell me Fkin, were you on the MB team or the DB team in this?   Did Pala or Lalian ask for your representation?  Did Jama or the other MB wizards?   <br>

So you have zero room to make this a discussion between the principles only. If you want examples of how you contradict yourself I would submit that Esm and others have done a pretty good example of this in these threads without even having to look at my posts. I also ponder how proposing an honerable alternative solution (as I view it) is so wrong. Perhaps its just because it puts your position in such a bad light. Hell Gaelron is no particular friend of mine but at least he posted that perhaps I had a point there.<br>
<br>
<br>
 True enough Esm I added the extra junk when I was called a bad guy for questioning the process and frankness of what has gone on. At least I am not the only one who has asked these questions. If Gurunt and Denia wanted to turn up the heat so to speak I didnt particularly mind.<br>
 I do agree that we are straying from the actual point(s) though, and I will reserve judgement until I see if anything is actually done. I wont hold my breath though.<br>

Perhaps if you didnt give such vague and retractable answers/statements to the people whom were wronged you would find more of them willing to speak with you about it.<br>

<br>
Fkin never has stake in anything on this board... how many people really do? This is a flame board.. You don't owe it to us to give us an explanation on what happened but it would be in your best interest to find out what happened and make it known some way.<br>
<br>
and is Fkin using me as justification for being here? so you do need me ha!<br>

You are right though, I have no stake in this besides hopefully seeing that maybe this one time some accomodation is reached. Take it or leave it. Kudos to Karaway and Azile for their honesty. Kudos also to Gaelron ironically enough - he presented the best case scenario (sort of) for the pull. To be honest it looks to me that one person managed to decide he was going to walk over another raid with a flimsy excuse - but again thats just my perverted opinion.<br>

Some of the analogies made in this thread are so incredibly moronic that i marvel you people don't walk out the door every morning with your underwear on your head.<br>
<br>
p.s. if that philosopher friend of an eq junky does read this entire thread, i take it upon myself to apologize to him for such a collossal waste of his time.<br>
