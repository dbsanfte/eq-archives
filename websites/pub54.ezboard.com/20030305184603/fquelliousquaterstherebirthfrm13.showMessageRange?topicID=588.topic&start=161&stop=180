Hi Seph! Butting heads again I see, you and I. I would be very curious to know whether you are saying you heard things about Draug or his guild. Either way, don't be a tease.<br>
<br>
As for this thread...<br>
<br>
I'm not on LC's side. This wasn't exploiting a bug, it was taking advantage of human error while it lasted. Sure, they should've gone through the same pains as LC, but roll the incident back a few months, before LC killed the emp, and LC would not have passed up the opportunity. -Any- guild would have done the same thing and I couldn't hold it against them for putting a dent in the Luclin timesink.<br>
<br>
As for Wraith...<br>
<br>
Fast on the heels of any fuck up, small or large, comes Gurunt, best spoken of the lot, with words of peace and compromise on Explicit's website. In exchange he asks for patience and understanding, but there's a point where everyone's patience and understanding begins to wan. Too bad Gurunt doesn't care enough to call for disciplinary action within his guild whenever he feels the need to defend its leaders. Empty words, all of them, if your crew does their own thing. Lucky for you, Gurunt, you can fall back on the &quot;I don't have power over my guild&quot; defense. You can assume the role of spokesman on message boards and continuously explain the actions of Wraith, asking other guilds to be reasonable without making a promise yourself. A nifty diversion to cool the blood of everyone who crosses with Wraith until the next fuck up. Rinse and repeat.<br>
<br>
At this point I would like to see nothing more than the top guilds form a loose alliance with one goal: Block Wraith from progression at every opportunity, push them out of the rotation until they are forced to train or /petition to share a spawn at every turn even if I didn't see one drop. All you need is a common enemy, set egos aside, and a little trust. It's a very spiteful thing for me to say. But I'm also clear on my intentions, an area Wraith severely lacks in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usephrokdapathfinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sephrok da Pathfinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Da Pathfinder</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/20/02 10:51:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=164>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One man's words.</span><hr size=1> I was using the names that Draug provided, Woow.<br>

Whether Ketel was a part of the training i dont know.  But yes, Getcha from RIP was.  I'm not for training, and as a guild we havn't like.. condoned it as a general consensus.  But that is one situation where training was EASILY justifyable.<br>
<br>
Esmalyn: Read through this post and other posts regarding Explicit.. those are the things i've heard that they (as a guild) have done. (Whether its true or not, i dont know)  The actions of one man should never be held against a whole guild... however.. the actions of the guild as a whole can &amp; probably will be held against people within the guild... if you honestly say you dont, and never will, do those actions, and seem to be *STRONGLY* against it, then you shouldn't be in the guild doing those things. <p><center>

<br>
It's kind of sad labeling Wraith as a 'zerg' guild because they have alot of people.  Wraith is a large guild mostly (IMO at least) due to the fact that raiding isnt required, so they need more members since alot are part timer players/raiders.  So what if on a given night more people log on than the 'accepted' amount needed for an encounter, are they supposed to tell people NOT to come to a raid for fear of 'zerging'? Geez people get a grip.<br>
<br>
And for all you old school haters, get over it.  The make up of the guilds today are much different then they were back in the day, and are always changing.... holding a grudge agaist a guild for so long is just sad....that would be like me hating some of my friends that are newer members of Vis for the actions of their predecessors (sp?) may have done back in the day, that aren't even IN the guild anymore.... don't make sense does it?<br>

&quot;especialy things that i have *heard* that you've done...&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't care for Explicit personally but I've known Draugrim a good deal longer than this game's been in existence to where I won't hesitate to say right now that if the likes of you or any other no-name pinhead slithers out of the woodwork with accusations that Draugrim has ever intentionally trained or cheated anyone for personal profit I'll flat out call you a liar.<br>
<br>
and &quot;Speaking of your point... you are a part of a guild.. when that guild does things as a whole... especialy things that i have *heard* that you've done... you definetly are going to be branded by your tag.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not that I need your permission on how I form my opinions of a person or group but this is exactly why I think Rel in Por is filled with a bunch of profane childish brats who only &quot;play nice&quot; when they're afraid they might get run down by larger guilds but don't hesitate to train or kill-steal from smaller groups in their way. That is how their leader portrays himself and is the behavior he publicly endorses. <br>
<br>
<br>
Regarding the planar rifts...<br>
<br>
While it's not the way I'd personally want to get my Vex Thal key if I were so inclined to pursue one, I wonder how many people would NOT kill them for the piece if some kind of bug had them randomly appear around the temple every few hours or so or after any named mob was killed.  Verant has done enough repair patching in Ssra for it to be featured on This Old House, so I wouldn't think anything one way or the other of any group doing it and chalk it up as them revamping the key quest again since they are claiming to do away with time sinks.  And whichever group did kill those wraiths is still going to have to go after the Emperor for his loot and more key pieces anyway so it's not as if they're skipping steps in progression.<br>

What personal profit?  You obviously know nothing of the situation so i dont know why you are sticking your nose in it with your ignorance.<br>
<br>
As for Draugrim... yup he's a nice guy, I like him &amp; respect him.  I never said he trained or KS'd or anything, but he's affiliated with a guild who has been accused of those actions.<br>

Right.. explain why we helped a lesser guild that has never killed Cazic THule before, clear Plane of Fear, then let them have a shot at CT first because they were in PoF first?<br>
<br>
Or when we backed down to Wraith's &quot;smaller group&quot; on a hellish patch day in the ssra basement.. when they had like &lt;20 people there, cos login servers were all f'd up...<br>

Can you explain why you felt you had a right to call for a roll with Alliance on Dozekar back in July when you admitted on your own board that you were not in HoT first: &quot;Just pointing out that RIP &amp; Alliance arrived in HoT at about the same time. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     (we definetly weren't there first)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> But the fact still remains.. I offered them to team up and share loot in a fair way, and they refused, I offered to /random for Doze and they refused... I told him (Senwen) I guess the competition goes on...&quot; <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub131.ezboard.com/feqrip85890frm1.showMessage?topicID=693.topic">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, then leapfrogged us after we cleared the pit?<br>
<br>
And to think we didn't sink down to training you although we felt we had every right to the mob, unlike that pussy move you pulled with Wraith in Kael. But I breathlessly await your reply, which will no doubt contain personal justifications on your &quot;eye for an eye&quot; view and simultaneously excuse yourself of any wrongdoing.<br>
<br>
As for playing that &quot;I heard so-and-so did this and that,&quot; coming from the guy who believed, for a moment, in Marcuse's weak story that our monk's strings were being pulled by FH like some fucking puppet show, yeah, you'd likely suspect the first thing you hear. <br>
<br>
Perhaps acts of generosity, such as bowing out for other guilds, depends on the likelihood of that guild succeeding.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 10/20/02 12:44:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usephrokdapathfinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sephrok da Pathfinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Da Pathfinder</span><br>  Posts: 187<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/20/02 12:44:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=170>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One man's words.</span><hr size=1> No, we weren't in HoT first.

Maybe I'm reading this incorrectly: &quot;(we definetly weren't there first).&quot; Would you care to elaborate for someone as ignorant as I?<br>
<br>
&quot;I did my best to work out a FAIR AGREEMENT, but all efforts were /veto'd, so the competition rolled on. We won fair and square. You lost, and continue to dwell on it.. not my fault you are a sour looser.&quot;<br>
<br>
You had as many chances of winning as we did. You won by jumping down the stairs and engaging the mob first, using PNP to your advantage, probably knowing we would respect Verant's terms. Too bad when a better puller draws aggro away from your intended mob, KT, while the other monk loses aggro, and can single pull the damn thing, you don't hold yourself to those terms and resort to dropping the arena on a raid's head when the other &quot;competition&quot; beats you to the punch. But like I said: &quot;...I breathlessly await your reply, which will no doubt contain personal justifications on your 'eye for an eye' view and simultaneously excuse yourself of any wrongdoing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And funny you are bringing that up when, Mosa, infact, trained us.

<br>
Sorry darlin'. I told you on your board that I was not there to defend Mosa in the past, just bring to light what happened that night, and dispel that idiot's inflammatory remarks that won the anger of Barthin along with the idea that Mosa was training you behind the doors on purpose. But if you want to continue believing Mosa trained on purpose, you're welcome to it, as well as believing Mosa was an undercover agent for FH.<br>

<br>
I'm more than LC, Vis, or Explicit have to apologize for what they do.  <br>
<br>
I argue with my guild (including officers) from time to time. It happens. <br>
<br>
I'm one of the very very few (Woow, Desi, Seph are the only others I see from this thread) that understand we ALL pull shit off in a big grey area.  We didn't feel Explicit had near the force needed, they disagree.. we fight.  The ONLY difference between that and when LC moved in on us for cursed, or Ntov, or any number of incidents with any number of guilds over any number of mobs over the years... is nothing... WE ALL DO THAT CRAP.  Cursed wasn't the first time Wraith has done it either, and I know of a ton of incidents like this with all guilds.  Not even &quot;uber&quot; guilds it happens on Trakanon, Venril Sathir, Vindicator... everything.<br>
<br>
I don't blame Explicit from not liking what happened on Cursed.  (compare this to some others that so vehemently defend what they do as absolutely right.. or totally the other guys fault for not leaving when told)... What upset me is the next day.  The blatant revenge stunts.   When we got pushed out of both Ntov and Cursed we followed up immediately asking to join the rotation.  We weren't *offered* it up front  to make peace, we asked (and were accepted, credit to all involved).   We didn't go follow LC around and pick fights at all their raids the next day.  We understood what happened, and yes it sucked for us.   We disagreed with LC, but thats the game we all play.   <br>
<br>
The game most of us play is how the server has run the last few months... the biggest fights we have is when a rotation gets juggled due to some swap, and arguments are kept between officers.  The last rotation mix up we had, the guy who was mistaken owned up 100% on it and apologized.<br>
<br>
The game Explicit played the last few days is the game the server is gonna be if any one of the big raid guilds can't grow up and get along.   Only takes one guild to break a rotation, or to force all of us to spawn-camp mobs.  <br>
<br>
It really doesn't matter what we all did yesterday or last week or last year.  We can all mudsling and point out incidents and defend our part in them.  All that matters is... does Explicit want a spot at the table with the other top raid guilds, and will the other top raid guilds let them?   <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

As for my quote about not being there first (In tov for Doze).... I dont lie, i was pointing out that RIP was NOT there first, neither was the alliance raid, we arrived at nearly the same time, i wasn't goign to make false claims and say we were there first and try and force your raid to leave.

&quot;Jeez Esmalyn, Explicit said they were in the wrong in Kael and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> probably deserved the train</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, HOW FUCKING STUPID CAN YOU GET?&quot;<br>
<br>
Am I speaking for Explicit? Do you see a guild tag in my signature? I haven't played in about a month. Your guess is as good as mine if I'm still &quot;recruiting&quot; or not, probably not after I posted on Wraith's board against Shouja's wishes. Just as I can't speak for them, Explicit can't speak for me, so don't try to get me to bob my head like a fucking monkey to what Explicit said. Explicit wasn't there when you leapfrogged Dozer and doesn't have the same perspective I have.<br>
<br>
And for all that talk, I've yet to hear Wraith/RiP admit they were wrong for training. Desi, care to reply, or post a mystery link I missed in my board perusals that admits you were wrong for training?<br>
<br>
&quot;As for my quote about not being there first (In tov for Doze).... I dont lie, I was pointing out that RIP was NOT there first, neither was the alliance raid.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's pretty simple Seph. Two raids show up for the mob. You admit you were not there first. That would leave Alliance, unless there was a third party I'm not aware of. *Someone* had to be there first and by your own admission it wasn't you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usephrokdapathfinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sephrok da Pathfinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Da Pathfinder</span><br>  Posts: 190<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/20/02 2:46:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=177>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One man's words.</span><hr size=1> for Dozekar: No one was there &quot;first&quot;.

Perhaps now a few more people other than Wraith/Rev/LC will be able to go to VT now.   A little competition is nothing bad.  Time to start getting used to it folks.

Go back and quote *anywhere* I said &quot;RiP KSes/Trains smaller guilds.&quot; The closest I came to mentioning your behavior around other guilds, aside from the two examples I used, was this: &quot;Perhaps acts of generosity, such as bowing out for other guilds, depends on the likelihood of that guild succeeding.&quot;<br>

Grats on winning the competition by competing against others who, lucky you, played by the rules. BTW, unless there have been scientific breakthroughs made in pasteurization, milk has not gained the ability to take human shape and type.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kael: Yes training is wrong, Getcha was wrong for training, happy? And what does that prove? Absolutely nothing.&quot;<br>

It may not prove much, certainly not bring anything new to light, but it's quite useful. You won't be able to say, &quot;RiP never trains.&quot; You won't forget you can't claim you took the high road with that one, and if your memory slips, I'll be nice enough to remind you.<br>
<br>
Don't worry, Seph. I just want to make sure you are not part of a guild that trains or approves of training so you won't get branded by your tag as you brand others by theirs.
