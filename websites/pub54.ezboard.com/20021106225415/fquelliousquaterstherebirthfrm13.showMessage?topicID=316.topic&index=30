Wow Stylee, you're very talented at taking something out of context!  If you take the first one within its entire sentence, these two statements are not mutually exclusive.  I will rephrase them to make this more clear: Everyone is an amateur film critic to a certain extent since we can all post our opinions here.  What I should have said in the second was that I never claimed to be anything more than that.<br>
<br>

Sorry, but CGI characters still lack a large degree of realism, especially when used as main characters such as Jar Jar in Ep.1 but even more so Yoda here in Ep.2.  Frank Oz' work is amazing and I do prefer it.  They crossed a significant line when they not only made a fight scene between two characters almost entirely of CGI, but one of those two principle characters in the scene as well.  <br>
<br>
Now I know they couldn't possibly do an action scene with Yoda using a muppet, and this was the tradeoff.  I accept this; I just don't think it turned out all that well.  Esmalyn put it best - it was funny as hell seeing Yoda walk in and do a lightsabre fight, but as an action/fight scene it was ridiculous.<br>

Im just curious what is used to determine the realism of a &quot;being&quot; that doesn't actually exist. Yoda doesn't exist. We have no real Yoda to compare this one to. We cannot A-B movements of a live Yoda and a CGI Yoda for accuracy.<br>
<br>
Why nitpick the actions of characters in what is a fantasy world? The fact that the movements are &quot;alien&quot; to us, or &quot;seem fake&quot; is only due to the limitations we put on ourselves in making an attempt to compare it to real life.<br>
<br>
Thats the enjoyment of fantasy films, and worlds, and creatures. They do not have to be human-like or lifelike...in fact, they arent supposed to be.<br>
<br>
Let them break the rules.<br>
It is a fantasy world you know...<br>
<br>
Imaginations never hurt anyone, you know. Using some of the logic Ive seen in this thead, I wonder what some of you guys (And gals) childhoods must have been like. I can just imagine playing &quot;War&quot; with you for example and then arguiing that just because I pointed my finger at you and went &quot;boom&quot;,  you arent dead.<br>
<br>
Loosen up, loosen you mind, enjoy thinking outside of the lines, it really is quite relaxing and enjoyable. Otherwise, I fear you will be suing someone for shooting a spitball at one of your kids someday....<br>

haven't seen this latest installment of SW yet but it wouldn't need to be very impressive to better Phantom Menace.  Episode One was the biggest load of crap ever because put simply it was  made to appeal and pander to todays generation of children who grow up on pokemon and other rediculous junk being spewed out.  If the Episode 2 is anything like Episode 1 with its pretty graphics , lame acting, pathetic dialogue then George Lucas should be congratulated on destroying the SW dream while laughing all the way to the bank.<br>

Shrek was also rated PG and it was a helluva lot better. PG or G doesn't have to mean only kids will enjoy the movie. They could've kept all audiences in mind when they made it. It's the nice thing to do, ya know, since I'm sure faithful fans who grew up on the old Star Wars generated considerable profits for the Episodes. The tension between Leah and Solo was all right because they didn't take themselves as seriously as Anakin and Amidala.<br>

This story line which hits  ANYONE with or without a religious background could not be used in his new episodes, they were played out.<br>
<br>
Thats why nothing seemed trite in the old ones (eventhough EVERYTHING is better in the new ones, including the writing), the first three stories were grounded on the basics of human nature and psychology. Each character represents a key aspect of society and the battle between good and evil in us all.<br>
Please refer to Joseph Campbells , &quot;A Hero with a Thousand Faces.&quot;<br>
Lucas based his characters and their struggles on this mans life work. Campbell was very proud to play a part in these epics movies displaying that the nature of humanity,when stripped to its purist form, is the same in all societies. The roots of every religion.<br>
<br>
I have yet to speak with one child that doesnt LOVE TO DEATH these movies! So what if theres a lot more bells and whistles, thats the new generation, deal with it.<br>

<br>
as for the fight scene with Yoda.. i liked it.  you know why? cause i have a @#%$ imagination.  how would you have had Lucas depict Yoda in a lightsaber duel?  He is a funny character only because of his physical appearance. (small green and wrinkly) &quot;judge me by my size, do you?&quot;  but you have to remember he is a jedi master and the most powerful force user alive other than palpatine.  i, for one, loved seeing him bust out his powers, and i think the computer animation was the best possible way to depict him in a lightsaber duel.<br>

I thought ep2 was absolutely brilliant with 4(ish) exceptions.<br>
<br>
(1) NO EWOKS!!!! What was the bearded one thinking?? There'd best be some in Ep3 or I'm gonna cry.<br>
<br>
(2) Jar-Jar does't die messily, or indeed at all. You think by now the Yardies would have caught up with him and given him a headectomy for taking the micky so badly out of their accent, too.. *shrug*<br>
<br>
(3) The whole Titanic thing. If George Lucas thinks that's romance, I pity his other half. I'm sorry, but Mills and Boon has NO place in Star Wars. Yes, the love story is obviously essential to the history of the SW universe, but it was done about as tastefully and subtly as Quas' dress sense.<br>
<br>
(4) Lucas has apparently kept the tradition of having a large block of wood cast as anyone with the surname &quot;Skywalker&quot;.<br>
<br>
(5) WHERE THE HELL WERE THE EWOKS???? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I am also just incredibly glad that I was in a very dark room when Natalie Portman was wearing the white Princess Leia costume and doing bouncy acrobatics with no bra. Honestly Catalyn, I was just shifting in my seat because my arse had fallen asleep. Honest.. <p><body>

With that in mind, I intend on seeing it again...if anything else, to see if some of the lines were as badly delivered as I remember...and to see why none of the other Jedi kick near as much ass as Yoda.<br>

Oh, and if you can, at all costs see this via Digital Projection.  The Cinerama in Seattle offers this neat new tech...and it's WORTH the trip/wait.<br>

First, who expects a star wars film to be an art film?  They and Indianna Jones are the biggest examples of blockbusters.  I watched Mulholland Drive the night before I saw episode 2 and I can honestly say that Mulholland Drive had more to add to the world of cinema (OMFG it was good) but episode 2 was damn amazing!!  I don't judge the acting and writing of a jet li movie with the same scrutiny that I judge a coen brothers film.  Episode 2 was a star wars film, it had it's beyond cheesy moments and some horrendous one liners, but at the end of the day it delivered the jedi love and clone trooper goodness I desired.  To say it sucked just shows that you haven't been paying attention to John Travolta movies lately, and that you really have to get off your high horse.  Complaining that Star Wars isn't artsy enough is like complaining that your popcorn is missing a zesty duck sauce.<br>

I put this section in a p.s. because it has more to do with my own bias and less with what may be present here, but it bothers me when people attack pop pieces by art standards when the intention was never for them to enter the art world.  It usually suggests to me that the person involved either has an absurd ego or just wants to badmouth a popular item so they can feel good about being in some &quot;elite&quot; minority.  I could throw around things like mise en scene and the auteur theory of film, or I could discuss teh ramifications of the German Expressionist film movement of the 20's or the french new wave of the 60's to show my supposed membership in this elite.  This is all unnecessary because we're talking apples and oranges.  Star Wars is not an art film and should be held to a different standard.  Evaluating star wars by the same criteria as 8 1/2 is like comparing shostakovich to george clinton, one is obviously technically greater and a more momentous achievement, but the other one has the FUNK! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usfemwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>S Femwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of Beer</span><br>  Posts: 257<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/25/02 5:31:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=316.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Episode 2 sucked</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uqutsemnie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/25/02 10:59:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=316.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Episode 2 sucked</span><hr size=1> ya i agree you sound like an art critic cause<br>

<br>
jeez. i dont even have a cut and paste from the lead of post cause for actual quotable criticism it had NONE!  notta. zero intellectual value other then &quot;im artsy. i didnt like it. i rock&quot;<br>
<br>
BUT! you gave us more in a followup! i combed it for DETAILS. and i got:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
But when it came down to the body of the film - script and acting - it fell short. The script was so full of trite, simplistic lines that got delivered like they were reading off a damn cue card, I cringed. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You see whats odd is you had a laundry list of details for things you liked; however when it came down to what you didnt like you gave us &quot;script sucked. ty. move on now&quot;<br>
<br>
WHERE?  WHERE!  WHERE FOR GOD SAKES!!!<br>
where was it trite?<br>
where was it simplistic?<br>
<br>
lol i saw a professional review that said the script sounded to sophisticated that the love anacan had was to sophisticated for the boys age.  i suppose you might mean that such a sophistication is simplisitic.  possibly but you gave no details. <br>
<br>
its well known that if you dont commit to details its easy to avoid being wrong.  its a political trick. you have commited to knowing that the script is failed yet provide no substance.  your artsy background it seems alarms you inwardly yet provides no objective meat in the matter.<br>
<br>
how are we to react to that?  surely its nothing worthy of a rant.  <br>
<br>
are ya a faulkner? do characters have to conflict with themselves in some failed way before they have resonable depth?  that method is false in general. i remember a statement i read once by sartre:<br>
&quot;i can no longer believe in Faulkner's man. there is a trick and the trick is in not telling--in telling just a little&quot;<br>
<br>
you see with faulkner's &quot;depth&quot; he invariably created characters that couldnt exist in reallife.  But we accepted them because faulkner never gave us meat beyond action.  he never came near the &quot;why&quot;. the result is the reader has no &quot;why&quot; to disagree with: no &quot;why&quot; to find unbelievable.  the reader has to accept the character as insanely complicated having depth. surely deep emotional development if they could appear so much more complicated then ourselves. <br>
<br>
To steal a tone from your post. eventually sophisticated people like myself (humph) find this sort of character to be hollow.  if the author will never reveal insight then what worth is the character?   the reading is little more then an emotional version of a romantic novel.  Depth through self conflict is a recipe: once the genius of an extrodinairy man, then parlor trick of the gifted man, finally the sidewalk fair of the pedestrian.<br>
<br>
ill take what appears  simplistic and trite as artsy long before i will except an apparent complexity that the original author couldnt explain or understand themselves.   atleast with the simplistic the perception is by design of the author.  the communication is genuine.<br>

Personally I enjoyed Lord of Rings better as a movie.  Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed Star Wars very much and will probably see it a second time.  I felt that with Lord of Rings they put a lot more effort into it.  It seemed to me that there was movies first and foremost and the graphics came in second.  Star Wars relayed to me a sense of graphics first and movie second.  Whats everyone else think?<br>
