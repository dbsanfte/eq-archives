Did you people get a degree in the Philosophy and Morality of MMORPG's?<br>
<br>
Or were you just forced to share when you were a kid, and have harbored a deep-seated resentment against any sort of person that accomplished something you were:<br>
<br>
A)  Too scared to try<br>
B)  Too lazy to try<br>
C)  Too busy being A &amp; B<br>
D)  Couldn't even conceive of such an act, because in your little flock of sheep-like friends, no-one had the balls to stand up and say &quot;Fugg it, let's give this a whirl!!&quot;<br>
<br>
These long, quote-filled, insomniacs wet-dream, garbage replies need to stop!  <br>
<br>
Granted it's the flame boards... so make it a flame.  A short one.  You neurotic hate-filled creatures that keep spewing rhetoric about what's right or wrong, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah......  <br>
<br>
Try this:  Give Sephrok the congrats due his accomplishment.  You don't have to agree with his post, but by god, he did something impressive, that 80 percent (or more) of the rest of the server couldn't.  <br>
<br>
If you feel that sorry for faithkillz 'cause someone is &quot;gloating&quot;...  get in touch with him/her, and let them make their own reply, instead of tryin' to re-write the bible, and apply it to EQ.<br>
<br>
Bah.  This is why I rarely bother to read this supermarket tabloid crap anymore.<br>

I called FK a farmer for constantly MBing dragons (that was farming, no brainer there) but by farming these dragons it was RUINING CONTENT for mid level guilds.<br>

People farm, heck I've farmed stuff before to raise cash or get drops for friends or what have you, but I never stole content.  When you all accused me of being a hippocrit for selling a Jade Reaver, that was NOT stealing content since Reavers are uncontested spawns.<br>

Oh yeah, those poor mid level guilds who were 'denied' access to the same dragons that are now up for days at a time, wasting space.<br>
<br>
&quot;hell you should thank him, since he proved me wrong when I said that Rangers can't tank.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't care what he proved to you.  I've tanked mobs ignorant people like you think rangers can't tank and I am aware of my own capabilities in that area, thus I don't care what you have to say on the matter.  Subject closed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sephrok is the best ranger on this server, bar none.&quot;<br>
<br>
You don't qualify to make any sort of judgement on who the best ranger is considering your ignorance of a ranger's capability as anything more than a Sow/Predator and Trueshot dispenser.  Thus I'm not surprised someone like you would be impressed with him tanking Wuoshi.  <br>
<br>
<br>
and &quot;RIP is one of the top guilds on the server, and is known and respected by other guilds for doing more with less.&quot;<br>
<br>
The rampant number of incompetents I've seen wearing your guild tag tells me otherwise about being a guild worthy of my respect in that regard and when their leader is incapable of expressing himself without resorting to a barrage of profanity, that's another reason too.  Your guild's corpse count and childish behavior is not worthy of my respect.  <br>
<br>
&quot;next time you chose to clutter the boards with cut and paste posts to try to make me look bad&quot;<br>

She doesn't need to &quot;try&quot; and make you look bad.  You do that on your own with your sellable standards so just go back to farming Ssra and Sleepers telling yourself you don't farm.<br>

You got some good stuff in your post but some flaws so i will try to keep excessive quoting down..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>  Probably because, like me, they're sick of being stereotyped and told by others how they should and should not play their class and what they can and cannot do.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
exactly.. I for one was tired of the stereotypes that locked down every wizard as farming, loot whores, who didn't care about anyone but themselves and didn't have any skill.. I was also tired of being called a manaburner even when i wasn't killing a dragon.. I'm a wizard not a manaburner thanks.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> PvP skill has little to do with your ability to play a class in the so-called high end game or how well you work with others. [/quote<br>
<br>
True. I don't want to insult Draugrim here but the Title he got was for a lame ass event that was dominated by bards.  very few people showed up that were from top guilds on the server and when our group showed up we just did it halfassed for fun not to win.  test of tactics was also a group event too.. hardly something to judge someone on. <br>
<br>
 If there was a best of the best today and Draugrim and Sephrok went head to head.. It would be close I'd tell ya even though Seph has superior gear atm.  Also a little best of the best history.. No one expected Sephrok to finish in the top 4 let alone win it all.  He was one of the few people to win in the event dominated by Vis at the time.  He wasn't as well equipped as them and was missing a level or 2 and still managed to win... thats an accomplishment.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>  why ARE they still up for days at <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  Towards the end I'd say it was borderline monopoly but when manaburn was just beginning it was far from it yet people still complained then weren't getting ample chance to get their epics when in fact they were then.  I still think manaburning dragons is still good in moderation but it has been proven no one could moderate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Sephrok revels in the fact that he is immature and has no respect for others and thus is undeserving of my respect. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Thats a partial lie.  First of all &quot;most&quot; people don't have a negative impression of him.. There are definitely those out there but many of them are outside the guild and go on either rumors or jealousy.  There are some people with legitimate negativity.  Sephrok is in a position of power and therefore people will just hate him for that fact alone.. The decisions that make sense but people hate or because some lone person was trampled over by accident and didn't say anything.  <br>
<br>
Guildleaders are historically hated especially of uber guilds.  On the question of his maturity.  I would be lying if he hasn't displayed some immaturity at one time or another but who hasn't?  If he was really so immature do you think 50 people would follow him on raids and continue to stay raiding? If you say its loot then you are BSing because this guild wasn't always so uber.  It never would have reached where it is today without Sephrok.  <br>
<br>
He definitely has respect for others but they need to earn it and he may not display it but its there.. If he really didn't have that respect then he'd run over every guild in his way and as you can see thats not the case.  He always talks it over with other leaders in conflicts before proceding.<br>

That offends me.. No one in the guild is incompetent or I'd ask for them to be removed.<br>
<br>
I'd also say Sephrok is the best ranger on the server.. There are definitely good ones out there but Sephrok was trying to be his best when his class was considered to be one of the worst and he stuck with it. The hard work paided off.<br>

I'd say many people credit him with being the best. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

I would type whole long page worth of stuff here, but M.E. would entirely miss the point, probably even on purpose, just to say how stupid we all are. <br>
<br>
Also, thanks for bringing insults to guilds into this M.E.. Starting crap is Salta's job you know. :P  (J/k Salt... although not entirely lol)<br>
<br>
Btw, regarding gear in the BOTB fights, what about it? Strategy &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gear. Seph had crap back then, and so did all the other rangers.

I didn't mind sharing. I also didn't hound other kids for months on end when they &quot;stole&quot; toys out of the closet supply and refused to share. (/wave Seph!)<br>

Not the first time I say it... Pity's for whipped dogs. You think that's my motivation? You're harping about preaching morality and that is exactly what ticks me off about this thread; the naysayers likening burning dragons to nothing more than selfishness and admit to farming other content in the same line, fuck, even taking the &quot;stolen&quot; content themself; the naysayers who think they're on the moral high road and call FK on his/her actions for having the balls to disagree with them openly. It's a tad more complex than a gloat. But since you mentioned the Bible, we can buy a version for Sephrok and Montyy and they might actually STFU about the subject forever.<br>

But yea, the BOTB was about skill, not equip.  Zolina (lvl 57 at the time) was probably the worste equiped ranger there (no offense zolina), but she put up the biggest fight against me, she almost had me.  She didnt even have epics.<br>

Edit: Forget it. Montyy can keep absolving his actions, Quas can go with the pretense that this thread is one of sportsmanship. Sportsmanship without respect, go figure. And Seph can continue to feel he has the right to brandish his measuring stick at someone who does not agree with how the game should be played according to him; you know, the whole &quot;now working as intended&quot; thing. Maybe I was wrong about his age and he actually holds a position at Verant. Tough shit if the wizards in his own crew feel antagonized in the process with blanket statements. I think I will make this my last post unless someone comes up with a blockheaded statement that surpasses what I've seen here. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=esmalyn>Esmalyn</A> at: 11/13/02 12:17:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=impudent>impudent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Uber guild basher <br><font color=blue>QC Supporter</span><br>  Posts: 289<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/13/02 11:47:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FLAME ME BIATCH~ (faithkillz)</span><hr size=1> Can't we all just get along?<br>

I dunno about this one....<br>
<br>
I mean.. how many times does a tank, on the verge of dieing, have to keep being told not to run out of range of a heal?<br>
<br>
(for the answer.. ask Montyy)<br>

j/k<br>
<br>
(edit)  Actually.. EVERY GUILD has incompetent people in them.  EVERY GUILD!!!!<br>
<br>
NOW... the level of competency as well as the definition of skill of the person judging competence is a whole other matter.<br>
<br>
For instance.. <br>
<br>
Level 60 cleric lets MT die because heal was late.<br>
<br>
Right off the top... incompetent..<br>
Behind the scenes.. the cleric is also boxing a chanter and druid... outside circumstances prohibited a correctly timed heal.  Maybe a slow or mez didnt land<br>
<br>
My point is.. YOUR definition and MY definition of the word incompetence are different.  (definition = level used to determine skill) <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804">Impudent Blasphemy</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
