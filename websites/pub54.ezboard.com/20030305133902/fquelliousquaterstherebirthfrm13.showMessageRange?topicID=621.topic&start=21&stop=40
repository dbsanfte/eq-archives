<br>
Snare-kiters take up much, MUCH more real estate than any other group type. They seem more likely than other group types to train out (although I think that's because of the nature of PoV and not the technique), and when they do they give no thought as to where the rest of their mobs might be left. They are MUCH more likely to pull through or right beside others, simply because they need so much space. The play style is inherently sloppy. We've seen more people trained by a loosely-held snare kiter than by any other means, including deliberate training (howdy Citto, you fucktard!)<br>
<br>
The rumour is planar mobs are going to start summoning. As much as I'd hate that nerf, as it means an end to soloing for classes that were play-balanced with soloing ability in mind, I'd support it just to get rid of all the morons out there that are causing so much grief for anyone near them. Hopefully if it is implemented something will be done to ensure that the affected classes have something to offer groups that makes them competitive with others in the same role. Because the last thing I want to hear is another round of whining from Graffe's. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

 The other day PoI graveyard was looking like KC with the endless train in the graveyard. A GROUP got too many mobs and zoned leaving all their new friends for the people sitting at the graveyard recovering from rez effects. Half dead people zone out, new people zone in and get aggroed, new half dead people zone out...rinse/repeat...Karnors. Finally a warrior zoned in and was able to tank them until enough other people were able to zone in without aggro that the mobs were killed. It was totally ridiculous though and this crap shouldn't be happening. People should be more considerate (yeah, right). I was duoing close to the zone in PoI that night and when my partner died and the two mobs aggroed me I ran away from the zone to die so the people at the graveyard would not get aggroed. Its not like CR is hard in the planes and almost any cleric zoning in with a click stick will rez you if you ask nice. There is absolutely no reason to train others. Quadders, groups, soloers, duoers accept your damn mistakes and die. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaelron>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tolapumj wanna-be</span><br>  Posts: 914<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/29/02 6:08:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=621.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Graveyard Trainers</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> That's what guildmates and friends are for, no? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

My guildmates won't go out of their way to res me.. Not insulting them but we each have our own thing to do.. So I have to rely on in zone clerics and on my work days I can only play at night and at night while peaceful there are virtually no clerics let alone Enchanters around to c3 me so i can keep my camp which groups like to try to steal from me (another topic for another day)<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> As an example, the house where you zone out of PoN has the GY on one side and the entrance to the house on the other side. Why the fuck does anyone HAVE to kite THROUGH the GY? It's not like there isn't any place to kite. Or do you want the easy out by having zoneout really close? I don't know anything about you, Gaethan, but you don't seem like the type to pull a kite though other people, but I could be wrong.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't kite directly through the GY.. I was thinking you meant anywhere near the house in PoN.. Because groups will still complain they got trained even if I go WAY back around the back of the house..  training directly through the GY is stupid not only because innocents will die but also its too damn laggy anyway.  When i get in trouble and get more adds than 4 then i need to stretch out a lot because i only got run 3 and these things run fast so I kite all the way around the zone as safely as I can until I can either gate or get enough hp back so I won't lose buffs.  Sometimes people who are pulling get trained and whine.. I'm gonna do what is safe for me above all others.. Though again I don't want to get innocents killed.<br>

Yes you are.. You think its okay to nerf everything that doesn't affect you.. Other people play this game and play it the way they want to.. If all mobs in the planes summon they it completely removes a way people can get exp the way they want to.  It has nothing to do with trains.. You just don't want to see people soloing do you? Jealousy?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>  Snare-kiters take up much, MUCH more real estate than any other group type. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
depends on the zone, the creatures they fight and the trouble they are in.  some mobs are fast so more space is needed..  In PoN where I kite..  I only need about 20 yards of space.. Which isnt much but is still more than a group..  Quaders aren't likely to train if they prepare and are careful.. Only when things go bad do quaders train.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> The rumour is planar mobs are going to start summoning <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Thats only for Plane of Valor I believe because the exp was way too good I heard.  Thats okay I guess.. Its not fair for quaders to get WAY more exp than their group counterparts, but if soloing is removed for quaders in PoP.. Then I will consider quiting.<br>
<br>
I do think its unfair to flame people who quad only.. Plenty of groups and single kiters have trained zones too..   People should definitely not be kiting directly through the GY but sometimes going around is necessary and things may train. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

  I dont know you and have never met you...  But the truth of the matter is that quad kiters ruin any zone that they try to kite in.  <br>
  A perfect example is ME...  Has anyone tried to group in ME recently?  It's almost impossible to be at the zone for more than 6 mins without having some quader train the zone cause he cant handle himself.  <br>
  There is only one zone that quaders havnt ruined, even then its hard for any group to hunt there cause mobs get scarse, and thats CS...  I solo there alot for meat, gems, and skins.  This is a zone that was almost designed for quaders, but I understand at your (and my) level that the EXP there sucks.<br>
  Back to the reason I directed this thread your way...  I sincerly hope they DO make quading in the planes impossible.  And your liitle threat about quiting if they do..  save us all the trouble of listening to it and just cancel now. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.webspawner.com/users/davidsnyder01/Sig%2daalex.JPG"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END-->&lt;BR&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gaelron>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tolapumj wanna-be</span><br>  Posts: 918<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/31/02 3:48:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=621.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ketel's sig</span><hr size=1> gee thanks..  well i don't watch other kiters but how many times have you been trained by people just running through the zone or by regular groups in ME? stop blaming everything on the kiters...  if quading is removed then its unfair to only wizards and somewhat druids.. sks rangers and the whole lot and still solo and don't get me started on 2boxing with EQw. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

As youve stated before xp outside these planes for the post 60 lvls sucks ass which means they pretty much have had their soloing days put to an end already.  Quit crying cause you may have to actually group with other people now to get your xp like jsut abotu everyone else.<br>
<br>
As to 2boxing with eqw....  You dont need EQW to 2 box.  you actually prob wont be using EQW if youre 2boxing.  At least not to play 2 toons at the same time I would venture.  I can't 2box and dont use EQW so /shrug.  But, they are a totally different issue because they are available to everyone no matter what class you play.<br>

The designers know that kiters sometimes get out of control and wind up leaving a ton of mobs at a zone (hell not just kiters but groups who pulled one mob and got a few  adds by mistake and then there the groups that pull mobs right by the graveyard in PoN....but i digress). SOE should have known that tons of mobs would inevitably been left at the zone out and that putting a zone in/rez area so close to the zone out would cause this type of flame over many boards.<br>
<br>
So please, when you zone in and die, or rez in and die...say a few choice words to your group/guild/rezzer (i'll be happy to take the abuse as long as you donate to my cause) about some &quot;kiter&quot;, it may have be a group, and then maybe log or go exp somewhere else for a while to calm down. <p><center>

This is an example of someone skipping the post and going straight to reply which I knew someone would do.  I believe I said it wasn't about the exp.. It was about the ability to quad blues no matter what exp they give.. As long as its reasonable because I don't want to gain exp more so than other groups..

This my folks is an example of bias.. read it.  Hello, warriors are a grouping class. Wizards not are..  So what is that ae that only targets 4 and that snare that targets 4.. That for show or is someone suppose to do that.  Oh and wizards are fine in groups despite what others say in my opinion but thats not the way I wish to level.<br>

I want everyone else to have fun too... Its a game right?  However makes this unsnare hurts druids and wizards and someone rangers and shadowknights.  This really doesn't hurt anyone else.  It isn't only about my enjoyment. Those camps in PoV will still be open. People will still be trained because its a hard zone.<br>

<br>
I'm thinking about all the other wizards and druids out there who enjoyed soloing their entire life time  are suddenly not to be able to solo blues at 63ish.<br>
<br>
How would you feel?  Let go of your bias and think about how others would feel for once when things get nerfed.  If you want to say I'm thinking of myself.. How will anything be different for non quading classes with the nerf?  I don't want any nerfs at all but some are warranted.  Was the exp was too good?  Yes it was.   Was it okay to make it so people can't play the game the way they want to? No it wasn't<br>
<br>
Come on Tovarich.. Pretend you are a wizard for a second and try to think how you would feel about this.  Then you will see what I'm saying.  Let go of the bias.<br>
