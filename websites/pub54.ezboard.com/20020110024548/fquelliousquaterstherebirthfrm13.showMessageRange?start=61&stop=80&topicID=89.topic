I killed the bankers 3 times.  They have a respawn time of 5 mins.  The thing about the 300 hitting mob, the last time I did anything with the bankers I didnt kill him, just merely ran him around the city, Colach felt it was the smart thing to stand there and let himself get hit hoping i'd KS the banker so they would have something to petition about.  When I ran the banker around the corner the guy had aggro'd which I did not know, I ran past bank and he attacked Colach for fighting the banker.  /shrug not much else to say here, I dont deny it because none of it was illegal, if you all wanna get bent out of shape for having to wait 10-15 mins to bank go for it.<br>

Is that why you sent him a tell saying &quot;good job&quot; when you saw the banker tell Colach how he's ruined his own lands etc thinking that he was doing the same exact thing you were?  /sigh For someone who didn't know Colach had aggroed the mob you sure were quick to congratulate him when you thought he had sunk to your childish level and taken up your holy crusade against bankers.  You ran by Colach at least 15-20 times and for someone who is as good of a puller as you are to completely miss a banker sitting there swinging on a lizard is pretty unbelievable.  Sorry but that's a blatant lie and you know it.... if you had no intention of training someone who had aggro then there was no reason for you to keep running past the same spot and FDing on the bridge over and over again while you were &quot;looking&quot; for the zone out.  That lie doesn't fly... you're gonna have to come up with something more believable than that... I'd say take lessons from Gaelron but he seems to have trouble keeping his stories straight as well.  How many times did you get the banker today?  Count was 3 or 4 spawns or so wasn't it?<br>

If you had been on the throne fighting we would have left but you were outside doing nothing when i arrived.. I thought your leader (a liar) had told you all to let us pass but that wasn't the case.. <br>
<br>
He did say it was a mistel after everyone was at the camp like 10min after i asked him.. If he had immediately said it was a mistel then i wouldn't have gone in but he only said it was a mistell..<br>
<br>
The manor is more than one camp.. You cant call the whole thing if you aren't even inside.<br>
<br>
I real guild would have helped us get inside so they could have started pulling again instead of whining that we were stealing their camp.<br>

If NP were there for 2 hours and still outside the keep, they weren't pullign from *that* deep in.. not past the throne room anyway (much easier and better loot/xp by clearing *to* there and holding)...<br>
<br>
I really don't understand *why* this post was started, esp by RiP... they mucsle in on a camp, bitch about their shaman not getting to loot a nodrop SK-only spear, have Sirinab as a freaking character witness (and accomplice)... and got wiped out with a more-than-6-person crew in the freaking manor!   And you want people to know this?  All I know for sure from this thread is you hang out with trainers, don't know what drops where in Kael, and want to call attention to the fact you bully in camps and get wiped out in relatively tame areas.<br>
<br>
Not saying NP tried very hard to work things out either, but...this is hardly an incident like the staboo or Torras thing currently running.  <br>

I guess the only reason im here is because I like to think of myself as a friend of Norraths Pride.<br>
<br>
Gaelron, frankly, I think your post was one of the biggest accumulations of mindless garble I have seen since Mohogany's most intellectual sentence. You have so little evidence that it is truly, sad.<br>
<br>
&quot;guildmates said they saw someone run by but didnt get a name&quot; - now that proves nothing. Absolutely NOTHING.<br>
<br>
And the giants spawning together like that? How can you know that was NP? Frankly, from the amount of intelligence coming from every RiP member ive met, I wouldnt be surpirsed if one of your own members did that, and had their armor between their legs because they were too scared to admit it.<br>
<br>
And to Sirinab: You make me feel bad about being a monk. To think that people like you represent monks like me makes my stomach churn. Killing bankers? Mmmkay, yes, you can do it, Verant made it so you could...but whats this about your &quot;deal with it&quot; attitude. You dont think thats just a little immature? I cant even put words to how fexxing stupid that is.<br>
<br>
But to Norraths Pride members. Be careful about your attitude towards criticizm. Ive seen this many times, where a person leaves, and gives criticizm, and NP members go so far as to flame the person leaving. Be careful.<br>

<br>
First Gurunt.. <br>
<br>
You are right in the first paragraph.. We should have worked together but NP was rude from the second we got there maybe if Gemlin actually read what he said in game he could have warned his team there.. We didn't muscle into damn camp.. NP was outside.. We wanted inside 2 different camps nuff said..<br>
<br>
In the second paragraph is where i found what I didnt like..<br>
<br>
We were whiped out by 8 giants and our team did really well to the end we almost had it.<br>
<br>
As i said we didnt not muscle into the camp as i told Gemlin we were coming.. Not until we got there and started pulling he said it was a mistel... Please tell me what we should have done..<br>
<br>
and now for Minishi..<br>
<br>
Are you comparing me to Mohogany? Dont even dare..<br>
<br>
You are obviously biased toward NP since you are friends with them.. And you were not there..<br>
<br>
I am not bothered by the training thing if it was that.. I just mentioned it cause it was a part of the events..<br>
<br>
<br>
Secondly did you just insult Rel In Por? Dont even dare again.. <br>
<br>
If the guild wasn't great I wouldn't be there... I could be in any guild I want... I have older friends sprinkled in guild around the server who would give me a good recommendation but I chose Rel In Por because I felt they were the best option for me..<br>
<br>
If you have a problem with Sirinab start another flame dont bring it up here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And on a final note...<br>
<br>
This is really sad this happened as NP and RIP will probably be enemies now.. It was probably just a misunderstanding and mistake by Gemlin.. But instead of trying to resolve the problem He made it worse.. Good work Gemlin.. <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh and Take a look on the Rel In Por's member list to see how many &quot;dumb&quot; people you find on there.. you will find none..<br>

&quot;We should have worked together but NP was rude from the second we got there...&quot; - turn it around, and you might have a better version of the truth - Sirinab attempts to Ninja Loot a spear that she can't use and Luftacos' brilliant use of &quot;STFU&quot; to avoid straining his pea-sized brain to remember how to spell &quot;Up&quot;<br>
<br>
And now, the infamous &quot;train&quot; that doesn't bother Gaelron (or so he claims), but for some reason, he brings up in every post...<br>
In his initial flame-attempt: &quot;In the middle of the sequence 4 mobs appeared out of nowhere all stacked up so you could only see them as one...&quot;<br>
And in his last post: &quot;We were whiped out by 8 giants and our team did really well to the end we almost had it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Four or eight - you decide - is Gaelron's ability to count almost as diminshed as Sirinab's ability to observe common courtesy?  Or more accurately, can Gaelron come up with an even BIGGER pack of lies than he already has?  Either way - don't ask for any proof, because he'll have to go format his hard drive... <p><img src = "http://www.protectorsofknowledge.com/images/TovarichJones.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/6/01 5:57:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Norrath's Pride or lack therof</span><hr size=1> oh please..<br>

I have not lied about one thing... I just mentioned the train thing because it was a part of the events..<br>

Obviously you will believe your guild first over mine.. I thought I was nice throughout the whole ordeal I cant speak for my guildmates but I was.. <br>
<br>
I haven't lied about one thing, I have posted the events in my eyes.<br>
<br>
I put this post up to show how NP acted that day.. Obviously no one will believe me unless I have some blood samples and finger-print analyses..

&quot;..a poor player<br>
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br>
