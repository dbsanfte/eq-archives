Monks have this nifty ability called Block. It works like dodge or parry (can't remember which cause I'm tired) but works a lot more often than the equivalent melee skill. Even in the not-so-high-end, monks have become better tanks than most warriors and hybrids. This was Not Right, and I'm glad to see it's getting fixed.<br>
<br>
The Ch nerf doesn't make sense to me, as it's a little late to be saying &quot;Hey, hold on a minute...&quot; with a spell that's been in since beta. But it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> broken, so I guess it was just a fix that was a long time coming.<br>
<br>
Mod rod nerf, eh, I guess. I think VI will fail miserably to balance the encounters where this was an absolute necessity, because they always do. <br>
<br>
And, finally, the bard nerf. What bard nerf, you say? The one Absor will forget to mention in the patch that the rest of this goes live with! And then he'll come apologize on TCH and he'll ask for our feedback, and then won't do anything with it but use it to wipe the laugh-drool from his chin. I swear, if I meet him at this Fan Faire, he is going to get <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SUCH</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a swift and brutal kick in the ass he won't be able to sit for a week.<br>

One more good reason that the mod rod 2 changes is just BULLSHIT. I can't stress this enough... NOTHING WAS BROKEN... VERANT WAS MAKING MONEY... FIGHTS WERE BALANCED AND STILL *VERY VERY* CHALLENGING... WHY @#)%*!)%*#%)!*#% FIX IT?<br>
<br>
All of my guild's accomplishments will soon go out the windows.. these changes will make or even break my guild, as well as others.  I&quot;m afraid RIP wont have the #s to compete anymore, because it sounds like they are turning EverQuest into a zergfest where if you can stay alive for simply 5 or less minutes you'll win.  If that's the case, this game isn't worth playing.<br>
<br>
Everyone says how boring the ARch Lich fight is.. well if its so boring why do you continue to play EQ? continue to kill Arch lich?  Arch Lich is one of the most fun fights for me for the sole reason that i am PROUD that i am with my friends / family / guild killing arguable one of the hardest mobs in EQ (only 1 tier below emp / seru).   We had to come up with a decent strat, we had to exectue it flawlessly 100% ... and we did it.. without a zerg force of clerics... and now this nerf will pretty much break our healing power.. which means they better make fights a ton faster/easier or we're fucked... it'll be forcing me to AE invite people to make up for the loss of rods.... while those guilds with high #s can walk in, stay alive for 5 minutes and win nearly without a strategy.<br>
<br>
Mod rods BALANCED raids imo.. without it, mages are useless other then COTH.  Mages made it so you only need a REASONABLE amount of clerics... instead of an insane assload of'em which is stupid, since there should never be sooooo much dependancy on one class.<br>
<br>
Arch Lich would require 15 or so clerics, even if the fight was cut in half.. i'm sure Emperor would require double the amount of clerics as well (you already need an assload for emp if i recall correctly)... Just how long can 8 clerics last in a 2 second CH order for AoW without rods?  This is going to throw what little we had of class balance on raids out the window.. as clerics will rise up to be superior than any other class (as if they already weren't).<br>
<br>
If Mod Rod 2 &amp; High HP on mobs counters each other.. then LEAVE IT AS IS. <p><center>

I never understood the mentallity that giving anything other than uber_guild_01 a chance to get great loot was somehow wrong.<br>

But anyway, with PoP/EQ2 coming out, I think Verant will do a fucked up job of tweaking these encounters and we'll be left to sort it out on our own. <p><TABLE><TR>

<br>
The CH change will affect what...5 warriors on the server tops? And only then because if they are at 1% HP it will not *quite* completely heal them heh.<br>
<br>
Manaburn. I like the ability. The wizards on our server, for the most part, didn't abuse it. Wizards on other servers effectivley locked down the green scale market, and pretty much anything that could be burned. Wizards have only the members of their own class to blame for this change. Sorry guys =/<br>
<br>
Mod Rod2. Strange one. If they tune the fights so you don't need endless mana, this is awesome. Let mages have some damn fun for a change instead of summoning mods for 45 minutes. I don't think by any means that this change means encounters require more clerics, at least not once the tuning is done. Re-read the post. They said they want to cut down the long fights, and huge numbers needed for them.<br>
<br>
Monks. Should monks be able to take damage as well as a non /disced warrior? Hell no. A change to the monk class was not uncalled for, but perhaps an improvement to the warrior class would have been better,. Althought I'm having a lot of trouble having any sympathy for monks after reading monkly business and the safehouse. Biggest damn whiners I have ever seen. Monks will no longer pull. Monks won't be wanted. Monks will suck. Yea, well....the bad ones will suck and won't pull, but then, what will change? If you sucked before, you will still suck after this. Now go threaten to quit like all the other monks.<br>

Basically that's how I see it.  We all know it's verant and they won't retune the encounters properly the first time around but these changes do have the possibility of bettering the game in the long run.<br>
<br>
Manaburn:  Needed to be done.  This doesn't break manaburn at the end game in any way shape or form, it does change the trivial encounters that manaburn shouldn't be used as the sole weapon for anyways.  So you're going to have to coordinate your burns on raids, it's not the end of the world.  Smaller guilds can still benefit from manaburn, they just won't be able to instakill their targets.<br>
<br>
Mod rod:  I've played a mage, it sucks to summon mod rods for 30-40 minutes plain and simple.  If they properly retune the encounters to be doable without the kind of mana mod rods provided I see this change as being decent.<br>
<br>
CH:  Dachunker, Grongl maybe a few others?  CH rarely hits for full anyways, this is going to affect a very very small percentage of all ch's and hopefully it will make for more creative healing in PoP.<br>
<br>
Monks:  I can duo with a monk and my dc pet.  In that time I can kill upwards of 20 BLUE conning mobs with zero downtime.  You're saying that is in any way shape or form balanced? =P  It needed to be done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uimpudent.showPublicProfile?language=EN>impudent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sebilite Protector</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/9/02 9:07:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=567.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: omg</span><hr size=1> Few things here...<br>
<br>
As I only have a YOUNG wizard I cannot comment n the whole MB thing. However, many a thread have been started because a few &quot;yahoo's&quot; MB'd a dragon as another raid was getting ready to engage. In lieu of this, I welcome the change.<br>
<br>
Also, VI stated that they are NOT getting rid of the skill, they are only making the burnable mobs gain a &quot;latent&quot; effect from being burned, so they can't be burned again within a certain amount of time (1 minute was used as an example).<br>
<br>
As a cleric, I have never understood why a complete heal would heal for 10,200 hp's, when NO ONE (pc) in the game had that many hp's (most i've seen is like 6,500 buffed). I welcome this change as it allows VI to introduce and tinker with newer more aggresive heals.<br>
<br>
Personally, as a Cleric, I usually have issues with monks. for some reason they think they can &quot;take a lickin and keep on tickin&quot; better than warriors. IE.. They gain agro in a fight AND KEEP IT!! They refuse to FD, until JUST after I healed them (go figure), and even then they would complain. Some monks can take 4 maybe 5 hits before I need to heal them, thus wasting my mana if I need to heal them every 5 hits. For god's sake.. learn to FD.. tanks are TANKS for a reason!!<br>
<br>
I see many monks switching classes.<br>
<br>
I also have a YOUNG mage, not yet able to conjure mod rods. However, being on many raids, I see this as a double edged sword. Many a Magi complained that they were tired of having to mod rod through an entire battle (in reality it was usually prior to battle, they just had no mana during battle). Well, THOSE Magi's got their wish. No longer will they be forced to Mod Rod for the entire raid prior to battle. NOW.. they will do it DURING the actual fight. (see the double edge?)<br>
<br>
I do feel for the Magi's, as having played a younger level, I see great potential in them. But CoTH and mod rods do not do them justice.<br>

<br>
We all know AC is softcapped, which means in raid envirorments AC wont do a damn thing up to a certain point.  The only thing seperating SK/Pal/Ranger/monk/Warrior are HPs, and Warrior's tiny bit of innate mitigation/ defensive.<br>
<br>
No matter what your AC is, Vindi (for example) will pretty much always hit you for 700, yet in exp group situations, your AC will help a tad bit, but the extra HP that Warriors have would make things more efficient with CHs etc.. probably save some mana.<br>
<br>
Will monks ever take the place of Warriors tanking ubermobs? No, no way a monk is going to be tanking AoW in this expansion, no way any guilds in ntov or less loot are going to be using a monk to tank anything... and why would it matter if a guild that can clear Vex thall has a monk strong enough to tank in NToV? They deserve it imo, its called progression... the monk doesn't surpass a warrior but... still.. things should get easy enough so that you dont have to go by the book anymore (and use a diff class over a warrior to tank).... in the tiers below you at least. <p><center>

<br>
Manaburn:  It's about freakin' time.<br>
<br>
Mod Rod's: I think Mages were getting pissed that all they do is summon mod rods for 40 minutes.  This gives them some more interaction in battles.  (Believe me, I'm a necro and i get pissed if I am used in a raid as none other than a mana battery)  We like to participate once in a while.<br>
<br>
Complete Healing:  How many tanks have more than 7500 hps anyways?  5 on the whole server?  I don't think this will affect much especially now that secondary healers get semi CH's.<br>
<br>
Monks:  Never played a monk past level 8.  So I can't really comment on this nerf.  But it was my understanding that monks weren't a tanking class so I don't see the big deal here.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp. <p><img src=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/sashcro1/Grabem-staff.gif> <BR>

If it's a &quot;less than complete&quot; heal, shouldn't it loose 25% of the aggro it initially creates? Perhaps allowing CH's to be started alot earlier? That would make alot of encounters for smaller guilds (like General V`Ghera, Zelnithiak, Lord Doljon) alot easier, in my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uimpudent.showPublicProfile?language=EN>impudent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sebilite Protector</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/9/02 9:57:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=567.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: omg</span><hr size=1> Sephrok...

Most of the people bitching and moaning about this nerf is from Uber_guild01-05.<br>
<br>
OOhh... now they can't squish Semi-Uber mob's as easily, they MAY have to actually plan and raid the &quot;below them&quot; content..<br>

Take *5* minutes to think about the REST of the server.<br>
<br>
Stop.. Take *3* minutes (since obviously your too uber to think for 5) to think about the rest of the server.<br>
<br>
The way I understand your opinion, and please.. feel free to correct me...  Because I have not played EQ since beta (or whenever), I dont deserve the opportunity to encounter Uber_mob03?  THATS just bullshit.<br>
<br>
Stop..  <br>
<br>
I don't care that it's because your in a large guild.<br>
I don't care that it's because you have better gear than I may ever have.<br>
I don't care that I am not of a high enough level to be there yet.<br>
<br>
*MY* point is..  ALL content should be available to ALL players, not just to those that have been playing since the ice-age thawed.  <br>
<br>
** NOTE **  FOREWARNING... UBER-GUILD leap-frogging is about to commence.<br>
<br>
THAT is why RIP, LC, VM.. etc.. are complaining... NOW... you have to SHARE mobs with other groups.. (<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/nerd.gif ALT="8o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

I dont get it... the long asss fights are some of the best in the game... It does not allow zerging.. you have to deal with pops... more mistakes and failures can happen.... <br>
<br>
Yes there should be rewards for playing since the ice age.. building up your gear and your guild.... to turn around and make encounters that any group of people can do takes away all the hard work it took to build a guild up for those encounters... <br>
<br>
manaburn - should of happened long ago.. but after umpteen promises that it would not be nerfed... confirmed over and over again that it would not be nerfed... then it should not be nerfed... KEEP YOUR WORD OR WHAT GOOD ARE YA&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Monks should get hit less and have better defense... A big as dragon claw is heading straight for you.... Monk can dive, jump over, duck.... A tank in full armor... what is he going to do... hope that his armor protects him..... do not nerf the defense.. make ac count for something... All that is worth while right now is HP.... AC helps... but it does not keep you from getting hit for full dmg.... <br>
<br>
Mod rods... yea magess... but it is a necro nerf in disguise.... less mod rods, more necros.... sucks for me.. but hey necros used to the VI nerfing treatment.... <br>

<br>
Verant gave us almost a year since luclin came out to build up our guilds around the abilities / skills they gave us.. it is really too late to change it now.. this is something that should be addressed in EQ2, not EQ.<br>
<br>
If they are doing changes as drastic as these after a year, why dont they remove the SK class and any other classes that they &quot;dont like&quot;.. i remember reading before saying they'd have liked to make EQ with less classes, well, why not change something as drastic as that and refund the time spent for thos epeople who owned those classes and &quot;fix&quot; EQ that way? imo that is just as drastic as this stuff.<br>

It's just that RiP ain't *that* big, and it ain't *that* strong. They just, much like other guilds such as SoTU, like to try to cut it fine on the minimum number of toons per encounter. Nothing wrong with that.<br>
<br>
The GodRod nerf affects their current set-up and strat, nothing more. I personally think that Seph and RiP (and the rest of the upper end guilds currently feeling abused by this change) will adapt and overcome. Well, assuming they don't just quit and cancel (*smacks Moro* What's up, bro? =)<br>
<br>
I look at nerfs more philosophically. Not being uber doesn't mean I don't get to play with my kids, don't have a roof over my head, don't have food on the table. It just means that my EQ experience isn't quite so easy. Hey, don't we play these games for the challenge? VI is just taking you out of your comfort zone, nothing more.<br>

Adapt and overcome - Change, create, move =)<br>

The problem with the top end encounters getting a flood of new guilds killing them is a problem simply because of overcrowding.    One week spawntime on a mob with a 10+ long waiting list.  Like old PoH/PoF reservations/fights... <br>
<br>
It throws balance off whack.. right now it's reasonably well balanced.... RiP and Explicit are breaking in to ssra as we are breaking in to Emp, for example... as RiP and Explicit finish up in ntov other guilds are gearing up to start.... <br>
<br>
If we cast eveyone but LC (who were able to get their VT keys...assuming VT is still doable..thankfully they have the cleric army to handle it) back to ntov.. guess what?  The old guard wil be back farming the stuff lots of others were ready to start.  That sucks...  Especially for us who have worked  on Emp keys... gotten 4 shots in, got him figured out... we are set to kill him.. should have gotten him last week really.. and then at BEST we have to relearn from scratch.... or jesus Vis who've been whittling away at emp for months.... it's either gonna set both of us back a good while (meaning we'll be competing more with everyone else for other mobs still)... or it's gonna become a gimped encounter that will be little challenge for us and we'll see other crews incapable of the old emp immediately step up and conjest the spawn.<br>
<br>
In the end, we'll bounce back... ironically I've seen nobody more happy about any change in EQ in the last year than Desi over these changes... so I'm sure Wraith will adapt as well as anyone.   But I don't want to wait 8 months for them to retune the mob we are just now ready to take down. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>
