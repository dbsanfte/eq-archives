The basics of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> story</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have been written for years - each script/screenplay has only been written as the individual movies have moved into production.  There's a big difference there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> and it is hands down the most original fantasy story ever. It makes J.R.R. Tolkien look like an amateur in fantasy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Whether or not it is the most original I don't really care, though I would put the originality of concepts on par with Tolkien.  To say that it makes Tolkien look like an amateur is blasphemy.  First and foremost, we're talking about an author vs. a filmmaker - two completely different playing fields.  Tolkien's world is just as rich in creativity and detail as Lucas' galaxy.  You're entitled to your opinion, but I don't think this is a fair comparison.  And just for the record, I thought the first LotR movie was fantastic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have one thing to say about this. If you have even wasted your time watching the Mummy or Wild Things, then in no way, shape or form would I EVER consider you to be a) artsy or b) a respectable amatuer movie critic.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Lol, so if I like artsy films I'm not allowed to watch anything else?  That's ridiculous, if for no other reason than you can never account for the tastes of your roommates.  I never claimed to be an amateur movie critic or to know everything about this subject matter.  What I meant by my statement was that you shouldn't berate me for holding Star Wars to a standard for artistic value as well as entertainment value.  And by the way, I've seen three of the four movies you listed.<br>
<br>
Yoda's litesabre battle - this is a matter of opinion.  I thought it looked fake and silly since it was a computer toon flipping around in the air making moves against a live actor that didn't look like he was fighting anything when his part was shot.  Episode 1 - Obi Wan, Qui Gon, and Darth Maul - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was &quot;one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You are just mad because you felt betrayed after Star Wars 1 didn't meet your expectations.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Please don't attribute thoughts or emotions to me that I have at no point expressed.  Episode 1 didn't underwhelm me as much as this one did.  While I thought it could have been better, I actually thought it was pretty decent, though obviously more of a kids movie.  This one should have been a lot better just because this portion of the story is more interesting - and I'll say this once again, I thought the plot/story was set up very well.  The actors had the potential, but the script and acting (therefore the directing?) didn't deliver IMO.<br>
<br>
N'Sync: I shuddered at the thought of it...the rumor I heard was that Lucas actually had given them roles as Jedi.<br>
<br>
Filch: Did I expect too much?  Possibly...but I would rather have high expectations that are met only some of the time than have low expectations that are met all of the time.  It's just the way I am. <p><center>

You seem to have to keep brining up the New Computer Animated toys and how much you hate them... I don't think it is the story or the plot or the cheesey one liners that really bother you. I think it is this movies total lack of Muppets. I would have to agree with you there. Every movie could use more muppets, screw all these cool new animations we should just use puppets and midgets in suits for everything. And screw color movies for that matter! I say bring back black and white. And sound? Bah, who needs it just play a little bit of the movie then flash some words on the screen like they did back in the day. <p>[60 Rogue] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=91273">Filch McPain</a> Barbarian of Quellious <BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/17/02 7:33:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=316.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Episode 2 sucked</span><hr size=1> So you don't want to see another opinion? Too bad. I'm going to give it a shot while I suck on lemonade and slurp Ramen noodles.<br>
<br>
I'm not a Star Wars geek. I just like good movies. What bothered me were the love scenes. I'm a sap for mushy scenes. I'll cry watching <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Fried Green Tomatoes</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Steel Magnolias</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> no matter how many times I see it. But the &quot;tender moments&quot; in EII were so lacking, so artificial. ::hits her chest to dislodge a moldy blackberry:: I have to hand it to Hayden Christensen for keeping a straight face--and those strings playing in the background...overkill! (That's not despair, Anakin. It's lust in your crotch, boy!) I'm not sure if Lucas or whoever wrote the script did it with a 12 and under audience in mind. Heavy suggestions wouldn't have made it better, either. The dialogue between Amidala and Anakin was forced and childish for two prodigies. Except for Amidala's ever-present parted lips *begging* to be kissed while refuting Anakin's advances, sort of a betrayal of her feelings for him and yet so obvious it was crude, body language could be measured in proximity more than facial expressions. Maybe the actors weren't allowed to flesh the characters out if Lucas felt it deviated one inch from his vision.<br>
<br>
Other than rolling my eyes each time the camera turned to the stiff pair (I wanted to take their pulse), waiting for the scenes to get over and done with, I liked it. The scenery was beautiful and detailed, the action very nice, and Yoda gave everyone a laugh. I wonder if Lucas intended people to take Yoda seriously as a warrior. If he did it failed miserably.<br>

Wow Stylee, you're very talented at taking something out of context!  If you take the first one within its entire sentence, these two statements are not mutually exclusive.  I will rephrase them to make this more clear: Everyone is an amateur film critic to a certain extent since we can all post our opinions here.  What I should have said in the second was that I never claimed to be anything more than that.<br>

Sorry, but CGI characters still lack a large degree of realism, especially when used as main characters such as Jar Jar in Ep.1 but even more so Yoda here in Ep.2.  Frank Oz' work is amazing and I do prefer it.  They crossed a significant line when they not only made a fight scene between two characters almost entirely of CGI, but one of those two principle characters in the scene as well.  <br>
<br>
Now I know they couldn't possibly do an action scene with Yoda using a muppet, and this was the tradeoff.  I accept this; I just don't think it turned out all that well.  Esmalyn put it best - it was funny as hell seeing Yoda walk in and do a lightsabre fight, but as an action/fight scene it was ridiculous.<br>

Im just curious what is used to determine the realism of a &quot;being&quot; that doesn't actually exist. Yoda doesn't exist. We have no real Yoda to compare this one to. We cannot A-B movements of a live Yoda and a CGI Yoda for accuracy.<br>
<br>
Why nitpick the actions of characters in what is a fantasy world? The fact that the movements are &quot;alien&quot; to us, or &quot;seem fake&quot; is only due to the limitations we put on ourselves in making an attempt to compare it to real life.<br>
<br>
Thats the enjoyment of fantasy films, and worlds, and creatures. They do not have to be human-like or lifelike...in fact, they arent supposed to be.<br>

haven't seen this latest installment of SW yet but it wouldn't need to be very impressive to better Phantom Menace.

Shrek was also rated PG and it was a helluva lot better. PG or G doesn't have to mean only kids will enjoy the movie. They could've kept all audiences in mind when they made it. It's the nice thing to do, ya know, since I'm sure faithful fans who grew up on the old Star Wars generated considerable profits for the Episodes. The tension between Leah and Solo was all right because they didn't take themselves as seriously as Anakin and Amidala.<br>

Thats why nothing seemed trite in the old ones (eventhough EVERYTHING is better in the new ones, including the writing), the first three stories were grounded on the basics of human nature and psychology. Each character represents a key aspect of society and the battle between good and evil in us all.<br>
Please refer to Joseph Campbells , &quot;A Hero with a Thousand Faces.&quot;<br>
Lucas based his characters and their struggles on this mans life work. Campbell was very proud to play a part in these epics movies displaying that the nature of humanity,when stripped to its purist form, is the same in all societies. The roots of every religion.<br>
<br>
I have yet to speak with one child that doesnt LOVE TO DEATH these movies! So what if theres a lot more bells and whistles, thats the new generation, deal with it.<br>

<br>
as for the fight scene with Yoda.. i liked it.  you know why? cause i have a @#%$ imagination.  how would you have had Lucas depict Yoda in a lightsaber duel?  He is a funny character only because of his physical appearance. (small green and wrinkly) &quot;judge me by my size, do you?&quot;  but you have to remember he is a jedi master and the most powerful force user alive other than palpatine.  i, for one, loved seeing him bust out his powers, and i think the computer animation was the best possible way to depict him in a lightsaber duel.<br>

Far too much time spent on Anakin chasing Amidala and Amidala protesting too much*shrug*...and the lines were delivered very dryly (mushy mushy mushy-gag gag gag).  The light saber scene was the best part but why....please tell me.... did Yoda walk away with the aid of a cane after flipping all over the place LOL, that just made the scene so unbelieveable :P  But what do I know, I hated Titanic *shrug*<br>

I thought ep2 was absolutely brilliant with 4(ish) exceptions.<br>
<br>
(1) NO EWOKS!!!! What was the bearded one thinking?? There'd best be some in Ep3 or I'm gonna cry.<br>
<br>
(2) Jar-Jar does't die messily, or indeed at all. You think by now the Yardies would have caught up with him and given him a headectomy for taking the micky so badly out of their accent, too.. *shrug*<br>
<br>
(3) The whole Titanic thing. If George Lucas thinks that's romance, I pity his other half. I'm sorry, but Mills and Boon has NO place in Star Wars. Yes, the love story is obviously essential to the history of the SW universe, but it was done about as tastefully and subtly as Quas' dress sense.<br>
<br>
(4) Lucas has apparently kept the tradition of having a large block of wood cast as anyone with the surname &quot;Skywalker&quot;.<br>
<br>
(5) WHERE THE HELL WERE THE EWOKS???? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

With that in mind, I intend on seeing it again...if anything else, to see if some of the lines were as badly delivered as I remember...and to see why none of the other Jedi kick near as much ass as Yoda.<br>

First, who expects a star wars film to be an art film?  They and Indianna Jones are the biggest examples of blockbusters.  I watched Mulholland Drive the night before I saw episode 2 and I can honestly say that Mulholland Drive had more to add to the world of cinema (OMFG it was good) but episode 2 was damn amazing!!  I don't judge the acting and writing of a jet li movie with the same scrutiny that I judge a coen brothers film.  Episode 2 was a star wars film, it had it's beyond cheesy moments and some horrendous one liners, but at the end of the day it delivered the jedi love and clone trooper goodness I desired.  To say it sucked just shows that you haven't been paying attention to John Travolta movies lately, and that you really have to get off your high horse.  Complaining that Star Wars isn't artsy enough is like complaining that your popcorn is missing a zesty duck sauce.<br>

I put this section in a p.s. because it has more to do with my own bias and less with what may be present here, but it bothers me when people attack pop pieces by art standards when the intention was never for them to enter the art world.  It usually suggests to me that the person involved either has an absurd ego or just wants to badmouth a popular item so they can feel good about being in some &quot;elite&quot; minority.  I could throw around things like mise en scene and the auteur theory of film, or I could discuss teh ramifications of the German Expressionist film movement of the 20's or the french new wave of the 60's to show my supposed membership in this elite.  This is all unnecessary because we're talking apples and oranges.  Star Wars is not an art film and should be held to a different standard.  Evaluating star wars by the same criteria as 8 1/2 is like comparing shostakovich to george clinton, one is obviously technically greater and a more momentous achievement, but the other one has the FUNK! <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=316.topic&start=21&stop=26>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=316.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=316.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=316.topic&index=20><img src=http://xtctripp101.homestead.com/files/qc/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=316.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=316.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=316.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=316.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
