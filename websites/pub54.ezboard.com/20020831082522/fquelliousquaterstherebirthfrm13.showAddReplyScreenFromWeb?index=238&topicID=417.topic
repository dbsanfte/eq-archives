<br>
oh and Montyy.. no a ranger's job is never to tank in the high end game, but that does not mean we cannot.  a well equipped ranger like Sephrok will surprise you if the main tank goes down and he ends up tanking.  a ranger with average gear like me will usually die fast in that scenario, but i am still a situational tank.  there have been mobs against which i have been able to keep aggro and survive where warriors/ pals/ sks were unable to do either.<br>
<br>
oh and Millikin you took that tanking comment from Montyy way too personally <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Why? Because the burn team can fail and not have a second chance where a regular raid can repeat until successful? Because if it doesn't fail a burn team is a more efficient? Because a regular raid uses the same tired old MT strategy and the burn team doesn't? VS is the only one that's even the slightest bit interesting.<br>
<br>
What is magic about 30 that's different from 5 or 6?<br>
<br>
To me a traditional MT raid is the REAL gimp encounter. A regular MT raid <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> suceed. May screw it up the first time, but then more ppl are there and you go again. Wash, rinse, repeat. Rarely does it take 3 tries.<br>
<br>
If burners fail that's it. Game over. Not too likely the mob will be still up in 2hours 20min.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> .. but at least we have a CHANCE. - Montyy<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Newsflash. There are not always enough burners available to kill these mobs. Usually burners don't camp these mobs. Someone hears it's up and then sees who is available. Who knows how long they have been up at this point. If burners show up and there's a raid forming they have simply left. Today Faydedar was up until he suicided on the Iksar Master and no one bothered to kill him. Red scale down the tubes for lack of interest.<br>

This whole don't have a 'CHANCE' thing is cowchips. VoR wanted Sev they camped him they killed him. Wow. Amazing.<br>

Competition, yes, it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Well how convenient that YOU get to decide who is a valid competitor and who is not. Who is farming, or bottom feeding, or wasting a spawn trying to take something that you think they have no chance to take.<br>

<br>
Well I wouldn't like it if I had camped VS or Phinny and they steamrolled me. Because, you know, I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> did</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> camp those mobs. You know old fashioned wait for the mob to spawn because I need the drop. How <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> unjustly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I sufferred in having to actually CAMP the mob.

But I really don't think most clerics would steamroll me, any more than I would steamrol anyone else.<br>

<br>
But regardless there is a very complicated and closely guarded secret of how someone may get one of these mobs for their epic, and yes, even get to use the marvelously innovative MT strategy on them if they wish.<br>
<br>
I will let the secret out now. Here in public forum, for all the world to see.<br>
<br>
The secret is: Camp the mob.<br>
<br>
Yep. It's tricky, I know, but what you do is park your butt in the zone with a tracker.. and you wait around until the mob pops, and here's the kicker.. then you get some people to come help you kill it. Bet you never thought of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> did you? Well I felt generous today, it being Friday and all, so I thought I'd let the cat out of the bag. It's all very complicated but I have confidence most people can manage it if they just try.<br>
<br>
Not only that, if you don't happen to have enough friends online at the time that the mob pops, which is certainly possible, you can even, if you have to, send a tell to an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> evil farming burner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and ask her to help you. Burners have been known to take short breaks from their relentless orgy of greedy farming to help people get thier epic drops.<br>

<br>
These mobs are over two years old and two expansions old. They are not a challenge anymore, sorry.<br>
<br>
Because they can try until they succeed, traditional raids almost never lose to these mobs.<br>
<br>
But burners do.<br>
<br>
There's more risk involved in a burn raid. You have 5-6 fragile wizards against one dragon. Many factors can go wrong. (One can even accidentally burn herself;P) And if it fails, it's over. No do over.<br>

Read back, eh?  The VoR druid WAS camping Sev in this case, just as you point out to being the secret....wait, also posted that he was the ONLY one in zone several times during his camp.  Seems to not have helped him does it?  You all still burned it, right?  Or did that change now too?  Yes, this post has been up a while, but it all started, if you care to remember, that the druid WAS in zone, WAS camping it, just as you big secret today says to do.  But you still burnt it.<br>
<br>
I'm beyond that case in question.  You my friend, are a moron.  They are not a challenge??  lol  Hang on while I get back up off the floor.  There are LOTS of guilds/people out there that would find the Kunark Dragons a great challenge still.  Again, keep justifying it for youself anyway you need to feel better about what you do.<br>
<br>
Now, if you want to finish my quote....I said they want to WORK for it, not have someone hand them their epic pieces.  Not have to BUY them because the MB's decided that the Dragons aren't a challenge, therefore they belong to MB's. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>

Maybe a few. I have known of two cases where a raid actually couldn't succeed with what forces they could get and were afraid of another guild taking it and asked burners to help. Who did help. And one other where we offerred to help because we saw they were giving up on VS. VS is tricky to MT, and is the only one who is remotely a challenge.<br>
<br>
But the vast majority of the time if a guild claims one of these mobs they do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> lose. It's a foregone conclusion that they will win.<br>
<br>
Whereas burns <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> do</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fail. Dragon roar is hard to resist. One LD or techinical error will not doom a traditional raid, but it certainly will doom a burn.<br>
<br>
Burns fail a lot more than traditional MT raids.<br>
<br>
Talasar, I happen to know what I am talking about. I've done both. You do not know what you are talking about, yet do not seem to be aware of that fact. If I am a moron, sir, what then are you?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 24-25 more people having fun playing EQ. - Gnobbi<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The logical result of that is that it is wrong for any single guild to kill a mob instead of inviting everyone that wishes to come, because the goal after all is to allow as many people to have fun as possible.<br>
<br>
It is wrong to kill something with 1 that 6 could or with 6 that 30 could or with 30 that 60 could or 60 that 200 could. It's just wrong and it's stealing content.<br>
<br>
Please the next time you think to kill a mob be sure to ask in /auction channel if anyone wants to come.<br>
<br>
Otherwise you are robbing people of potential fun.<br>

You slam Montyy for saying what he considers competition, yet you take it upon yourself to declare what is no longer a challenge, therefore it is just fine for MB's to farm them.  Sure, you know what you are talking about and you have god syndrom.  So feel free to continue your burns, because I do believe there is nothing said here that could convince you otherwise.  You will continue to justify being a loot whore anyway you need to so that can keep burning the Dragons.  Whether you've burned 1 or 100, it doesn't change the facts.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, the VoR thing, I believe it was posted by VoR that they just camped a force in zone so that there was no need to worry about someone beating them to it again.<br>
<br>
And I read the thread, if you read it yourself, the druid, I believe, posted that at times, he was the only one in zone.  Which would lead me to believe, that necro didn't camp it from server up, but just hopped in off and on. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>

<br>
Vox/Naggy were put in when there was a level 50 cap.<br>
<br>
They put a cap on them because they introduced other mobs higher level that dropped the same things.<br>
<br>
They can't put a cap on kunark bosses because there is no where else to go to get epic pieces.<br>
<br>
I would be fine if they but a cap on these mobs that if you were 60 and had more than 12 AA you could not fight them.<br>
<br>
As long as there were somewhere else that people that level without epics could get those drops.<br>
<br>
I would absolutely NOT be in favor of nerfing high AA Wizards but not high AA other classes. If it's to be a nerf it should be class neutral.<br>

This keeps getting asserted, but no one can say WHY.<br>
<br>
I don't get it. Why is 30 a magic number and not 5? Or 60? If it's wrong for 5 to 'steal' content from 25 people then why isn't it wrong for 30 to 'steal' content from another 30 people? Or 100?<br>
<br>
These mobs are two expansions old. They <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> trivial. Mudflation has trivialized a while ago.

I can't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> give</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> away weapons that are better than the uber weapons that existed when these mobs were intorduced.<br>

The thing is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> it doesn't matter</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Soon there will be enough burners to go around in most guilds and it will just not make any sense for any guild to organize a raid of 30 when you can send 6.<br>

<br>
Four to six drops from a dragon go to four to six people, not thirty.  You can't tear a spell scroll in pieces and give a piece to each and every spellcaster, or snap a sword in half and give one piece to a warrior, the other to a paladin.  As far as killing a Kunark dragon, you're saying Lotus Cult, Alliance, or Vis should not be able to kill one with eighteen to twenty people because it requires thirty or more of your members?  Excuse me while I laugh.  We don't need thirty people for Dozekar or Aaryonar.<br>
<br>
I have never seen any dragon on any television program, movie, or read in any book as stupid as the ones in EQ.  I've seen AI features in other games that have dragons behave more intelligently.  <br>
<br>
and  &quot;Now the excuse that a MB raid can fail? Wtf is that supposed to prove?&quot;<br>
<br>
It proves that manaburning dragons is not trivializing the encounter because the argument supporting it, being that there is no risk to the wizards participating, is false.<br>
<br>
Faith, you should quit wasting your time arguing with warriors who are jealous that the precious warrior tank/cleric heal scenario to killing everything has irrevocably been proven to be a less efficient means of taking down a raid encounter mob.<br>
<br>
Or better yet, have them kill their brain cells trying to prove that toggling an auto attack key (effect is instantaneous) and punching a taunt button while a cleric pushes a heal button is somehow more challenging and riskier than timing a manaburn with 4-5 others to kill a dragon before it wipes you all out.  It's not like manaburn is continuous like auto attack on or refreshes every few seconds like the taunt or heal keys.<br>

Only way you are goign to fail MBing a dragon is if you are retarded or human error.<br>

I'm definetly not jealous taht wizards can MB a dragon down, whoopdy do thats gimp... i'm bitching because MB shouldn't be in the game its ruining some things.. bunch of the same class shouldn't be able to kill ubermobs.. not the way it was meant to be.

<br>
I have only been on one burn that failed from human error. I know because I was the human that errorred;P<br>
<br>
So that means we have a lot of retarded burners on Quellious<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Some retarded burners in RiP for that matter<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I recommend you immediately /guildremove all burners from RiP because I know for a fact most have failed dragon burns and therefore must be retards. And it doesn't do to have retards in your guild.<br>
<br>
I am sure other guilds will be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> very</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> glad to hear of your decision<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But in fact burners do fail and it's not because they are retarded. Really, you don't know what you are talking about. (although this doesn't seem to be slowing you down any) Burns fail much more often than traditional raids.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 30 was a generalized example thx - Sephrok<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't care what number you pick, you still haven't said why 30 is ok and 6 isn't. And then why is 30 and not 60? And I mean, like, a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> reason</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Stating it again is not a reason. Proof by repeated assertion isn't going to fly.<br>
<br>
Yes MT compared to MB doesn't compare. Because MT almost never fails. MB fails annoyingly often. For several reasons. Since you didn't bother to read them earlier and aren't aware of some basic facts regarding these dragons I will make one of the reasons plain for you. Dragons Roar AE has a range of 300. It has lure(6) resists, which means it is very hard to resist. If it is not resisted it automatically interupts spells, and lasts for 18 seconds. MB has a range of 200, and has a 6 second cast time. This means a feared burner must survive a minimum of 24 seconds to try again. A Wizard's life expectancy in this cirumstance is generally considerably <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> shorter</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than 24 seconds. ;P If the dragon roars and only one burner fails to resist (unlikely) then possibly another can crit, and make up the balance. Assuming most burners have SCF3 on average, that's close to a 30% chance. If two or more fail to resist there is practically no chance. If you die while casting MB you lose it for 2:20 even tho it never went off. So the whole team is limp for that period, whether they got it off or not.<br>
<br>
Generally there will be some guild come to get the mob in question before 2:20 elapses, unless it's the wee hours. No burner would even think about trying to get a guild to hold off for over two hours so they could get another go. And if they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> did</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> think to try what do you think the chances are that the guild in question would say 'oh sure, we'll wait'? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Thus failures are not uncommon, and those failures are usually total, with no second chance.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, when's the last time you led a raid on a Kunark boss that didn't succeed in killing the mob? Even if it did take more than one try. MT <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> succeed. It may be a hassle to rez, buff, and try again, because people were sloppy the 1st time. It's annoying, but that's all. You still kill the mob. You still get the loot.<br>
<br>
The fact is burns fail on these mobs much more often than MT, which rarely really fails.<br>

ROFL. You think so<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Nothing is safe. :P<br>
<br>
In any event it would be easier for most folk to simply camp the mob.<br>
<br>
Yes, I know, it's a revolutionary idea. But people find it works.<br>
<br>
Moreover there's more REASON to camp the mob, because if for whatever reason too many people of your guildmates are offline.. it's not a tragedy. Because of the existance of burners you can still get your epic piece.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ..and you basically belittle him by saying that dragons are 'trivial' - Montyy<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Don't be absurd. I have respect for anyone that offers no disrespect to me first. Montyy I think you are forgetting again that you are a human and not a toon. You really aren't an Ogre Warrior. You just play one on TV.<br>
<br>
The mobs are trivial. Even you recognize this. I am not belittling anyone by pointing out the obvious. Am I belittling Warriors by pointing out they need better AA abilities? I mean after all there's the implication that something must be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> wrong</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with them if I say they could use some improvements, right?<br>
<br>

<br>
Somehow I doubt it. She'd camp it like everyone else camps their mobs. Or track it and have it burned. I suspect Milliken has no ego that would suffer from having to get 'help' to kill the mob in question.<br>
<br>
Like <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ever doesn't have to have help to get an epic drop.<br>
<br>
And yet.. Interestingly more people than ever before are getting these epic drops because there are more people competing for the mobs. They stay up less time and cycle more often. Green scales always seem to find their way into the hands of a Warrior. Whether given by a guildmate or sold by an evil greedy farming burner. More supply means lower prices. I don't really like the idea of selling epic drops, but it has always happenned, and truth be told the people selling them now are selling them for a lot less than they used to be sold.<br>
<br>
So claims of 'unable to get' these drops are specious at best.<br>

But guess what if it wasn't for a guild how easy would it be for a wizard to get that group in it?<br>
<br>
also 20k a week? maybe if you are involved with each dragon.. If you are lucky and get a high roll you may get a good item to sell give away or do whatever you want with. If not a high roll you will definitely get something but it won't be very good.. Remember these dragons drop old world stuff.. meaning a few good haste items a load of crap and maybe a few good spells and a scale or a shield. I have made a grand total of 40k off around 10+ burnings.. thats hardly 20k a week though it is a nice sum. I used it to prove myself.<br>
<br>
Sephrok that would all make sense if this wasnt everquest.. This game has no logic(makes you miss the vision). Dragons in this game aren't very scary and most if not all are pretty easy.  There are lots of broken AA abilities but the only one ever mentioned is manaburn? is that because it can be used to get dragon loot?<br>
<br>
At the complete risk of sounding egotistical and waving the guild flag... You know how easy of a time we have in ntov minus the flurry drakes. Does a CHO really take a lot of talent? I'm no cleric so I don't know just like the people who don't play wizards don't really know all the truth about manaburn.<br>
<br>
Again this game isnt very hard. Its really sad how we all fight amongst each other cause of the mistakes Verant makes. It makes you wonder how &quot;balanced&quot; EQ2 will be.<br>
<br>
As for the greed comments.. What is so wrong with greed anyway? it makes you want to improve yourself and others around you.. whats wrong with that? <p><center>
