Much to my suprise, the place was packed.  It was then that I remembered that Verant buffed the heck out of the drops to keep people from all leaving for DAoC.<br>
<br>
As it turns out, the only place that wasnt camped was the Betrayer Tunnel.  Well... even in normal times, it can be a death trap... but we decided to give it a shot (with 3 gaters, we just bound at the zone and would gate out in case of an overrun).  Luckily, things went very well.  We pulled mainly singles, and kept a great watch on the repops.  Once the cycle was set, we rolled right along... until a Vis Maior group screwed everything up.<br>
<br>
We were just finishing a kill (the warrior was doing a mana check), when Ffat comes running out of nowhere and starts running circles for a sec.... then heads down the tunnel a bit and proceedes to solo a mob that was to be our next pull.  Well... even though the Warrior got rather pissed, I kept a cool head, and sent Ffat a tell... asking him what's up.  To which he replied that his group was heading deeper into the zone.  Ok, no worries.  I asked him to please invis up so that he wouldnt interrupt our spawn cycle.  He said sure... but didnt.  He just left the tunnel, came back a min later, ran down the tunnel a bit, and started engaging mobs that were in our kill cycle.  The rest of his group (uninvised) sat around right at our camp, and sat there for a bit.  I ask them to please invis up, and after a few minutes, they finally did... but not without saying a few words to our warrior, who basically made a biting comment about &quot;big egos and small minds&quot;.  Harsh, yeah... but still appropriate.  <br>
<br>
So... was there a KS?  Nope, but that's not the point.  The point here is respect for fellow gamers, and common courtesy.  Vis marched right through a camp, took mobs from that camp (claiming that they were just moving through), screwed up a carefully laid kill cycle, and then had the nerve to make comments when we got pissed about it.  <br>
<br>
What I want to know is how hard is it to see a group camping a known camp area, inform them that you need to pass through, then allow said group to clear the way for you (or if we are killing too slow... to at least ask if it's ok to clear your own way) ?<br>
<br>
It's called respect folks.  It's also common courtesy.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<br>

<br>
  Invis past chardok dogs? pretty sure the dogs that were down there see thru invis, so walking down there and having a dog agro on us would mean all the mobs we invis passed would agro, and that would be bad.<br>
<br>
  The tunnel you guys were camping is sorta one from which the rest of the dungeon is accessed, and all the &quot;camps&quot; were not taken.  If you're going to post please use accurate information.  My group was, contrary to what you posted, able to crawl through the dungeon through maybe about 70 uncamped spawn, which could support about 4 or 5 more XP groups.  Also, did we steal your camp? No.  We were trying to move further down but to avoid trains you don't just invis down until you run into a dog that's going to waste you and fight a train of 5-10 mobs.  If the mobs you were camping were dead then we wouldn't have had to fight them now would we?  So why complain if you're in downtime?<br>
<br>
  The &quot;big egos, small brains&quot; comment by your warrior was unnecessary, crude, prejudice, and said out of stupidity and ignorance.  This comment was not said just because we were moving through your camp, but merely because I'm a member of Vis Maior and that's the stereotype you people make up.  You know nothing about us.  Name at least 5 of the members, what they're like, what level they are, and a specific story you've had with them where you actually talked to them.  Can't do it? Wow, imagine that.  It's people like those (sorry for the harsh analogy and sorry if it offends anybody but it's true) who label the USA as &quot;evil&quot; and fly planes into buildings.  Please read Ellison's &quot;Invisible Man&quot; if you still don't understand what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
  See Paragraph 3.  Read it? good.  This applies to everybody who makes a post like the 2nd one on this thread.  Igngorance if fine: I don't know much about the daily customs of a Muslim for example.  But the people who stereotypes are the same as these people that burn Muslim worship buildings (Masques if I have the right word).  Open your eyes and stop labeling people.<br>
<br>
  If you truly have a problem with Vis and have had bad experiences with MOST of it's members, that's fine.  I don't think I've run into a person like that yet.  Most of the people who have problems are like the 2nd post.  You met one Vis member, had a misunderstanding or difference in vies, see that they're a noted and powerful guild, blame them for all your problems and decide to jump on the &quot;bash Vis&quot; bandwagon.  Novel concept.  Hmmm... looks familiar.  Ever heard of Adolf Hitler?<br>
<br>
  Hate begets nothing more than more hate.<br>
<br>
  As for the group waiting at the tunnel, I'm sorry we had to move through your camp but there was no other way we could get deeper into the dungeon to explore.  That's no reason, however, to make the crude statement and have the hate sentiments you have right now.<br>
<br>
  Feel free to post Vis bashing after this or any more hate posts.  I don't enjoy reading them as I don't like knowing there are more and more people like that in the world, but you have every right to continue to prove my point.  I hope you change your ways and open your eyes.<br>

There's a phenomonon (found on flame boards especially), for people to point at someone/thing they don't like, and shout &quot;Nazi!&quot;. Which tends to make anything else they say, no matter how valid, look petty, childish, and uninformed.<br>

This is exactly what I'm talking about &gt;8(.<br>
<br>
You don't bother understanding the fact that I'm complaining about people stereotyping other people, and ironically you stereotype me.<br>
<br>
From what I recall, and what is hopefully common knowledge, Nazis murdered over 11 million jews in death camps simply because the Fuhrer told them to.  Additionally the waged war on the US and killed several of my relatives and I'm sure each person reading this can name somebody affected by that war.  If you don't support the murderous and &quot;master race&quot; ideals of Hitler, then why call yourself a Nazi?  Obviously, I pray, you aren't defending these people - &quot;The Nazis have changed&quot;.  So what are you really trying to say? I don't understand from the post you made.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to guess what you were thinking when you made this post, but, sorry to say, nothing logical or reasonable comes to mind.  What phenomenon?  How have the Nazis changed, and then why do they still call themselves Nazis if they aren't a hate group?<br>

What I'm saying is, you make a valid point about people sterotyping VM (which, I'll agree, is ~FOR THE MOST PART~ unfair), and then you throw in a reference to the September 11th attacks on the world trade center/Pentagon, which killed an as-yet unknown number of people and injured countless others. To say nothing of the scar it left on the American people. You then use this reference to compare people who stereotype Vis Maior to consciousless, cold-blooded, religiously fanatical killers.<br>
<br>
Do you see my point now?<br>
<br>
Also, please bear in mind... VM did used to be full of people who were absolute, utter, cockknockers. People who would think nothing of stepping on the toes of other people for no other reason except they could, and there was usually nothing the stepped-on could do about it. Things have changed; VM is no longer a bad group of people, but they still bear that burden. It's something you know when you accept the tag, and it's something you'll always have to fight. A lot of players on the server accept the anti-Vis sterotype because of a reason you yourself sighted- we frankly don't see much of you guys.<br>
<br>
If you want people to stop their bitching, think before you do things. I'm not saying you were wrong (regarding what happened in Chardok last night), but I am saying you could have handled things a little more sensitively than you did. And telling someone that they're in the wrong because they had a comfortably broken spawn (and weren't killing fast enough for your purposes) doesn't help either.<br>

And sir arn't you nothing but a hypocrite by calling me ignorant when you dont even know me...but cough that is the type of arrogance I have found very typical of many Vm members<br>
<br>
I have no problem with having a difference of opinion with another person we are all entitled to them but when you say that it was with only one person, I know quite a few people who have friends within vm...I've lost one or 2 to vm and later they gained the arrogant attitude...<br>
<br>
I in no way blame VM for anything that happens to me unless of course one member purposefully trains me then maybe I can blame them :P. What happens to me in this game is a reaction to what I do and possibly what others around me do....<br>
<br>
Ohhh and I love being called a blind sheep that follows around everyone else...every person makes their own decisions and that is based on life experieces... I take shots at vis because It takes a HELL of a lot to get me pissed at anyone and numerous times i have just walked away from a camp just to save time on a argument over a camp and such. <br>

You think these people think, &quot;Hey, it'd be really cool to run a plane into a building a kill 10s of thousands of people&quot;.  You don't think Hitler believed what he was doing was good?  These people may be &quot;cold-blooded&quot; and &quot;religiously fanatical killers&quot;, but they are NOT &quot;consciousless&quot;.<br>
<br>
Under the circumstances it is a crude analogy; I don't expect these people to wage genocide on others.  But really, how much does it take?  Hitler was able to convince an entire nation using these hate techniques.  This may be minor compared to what happened, but I'm just pointing out that this is human nature and it is a bad trait.  The extreme example was meant to show what happens at the end of the spectrum.  If everybody thought to themselves &quot;I wonder what it would be like to be ______&quot;, they might start to understand others and there would be no wars or hate in the world.  Unfortunately, ignorant and blind people don't understand.  In short, I'm saying that this trait in people has lead to atrocities for millinea, from ancient Greece to today.  If there weren't stereotypers, this stuff wouldn't happen.<br>
<br>
You can't stereotype terrorists as consciousless - In fact, they do this outright believing that they're in the right.  And do you know why? because they fear the unknown.  That unkown is the USA.  That fear eventually leads to hate (thnx Ishan, sorta ;p).<br>
<br>
OK - I've started to ramble and repeat a little, so if you're going to read anything out of this post read this: Stereotyping a group of people simply because of fear, what you've heard, what you've been told to believe or anything of that sort, has been known to lead to worldwide disastors.  Form opinions based on your own, personal, observed facts, not off whatever other people believe or whatever you want to make up.  I'm tired of people saying &quot;VM, I met one @#%$ from there (probably a misunderstanding) so they all suck&quot; or &quot;VM, i hear they all suck so I'm going to say they suck&quot; or &quot;My guildleader says that VM sucks so I'm going to believe him&quot;.  This is not as extreme as Nazism but it's the same concept.<br>

&quot;but cough that is the type of arrogance I have found very typical of many Vm members&quot; -- Which members? specific incidents? How many is &quot;quite a few&quot; out of a guild of over 60? How is pointing out that stereotyping is wrong considered arrogance?  How is this stereotype well deserved?  And why does this necesitate my being arrogant? Or all other Vis members being arrogant?  Basically, how does this post make me arrogant?<br>
<br>
&quot;I take shots at vis because It takes a HELL of a lot to get me pissed at anyone and numerous times &quot; -- this is a contradiction.  You claim that we're all arrogant, but then show that you yourself are arrogant in your beliefs and that if somebody is wearing the &lt;Vis Maior&gt; tag you take shots at them.  I have taken no arrogant stances in my posts, believing myself to be above you.  On the contrary, my post was exactly about being against that.  Arbitrarily lashing out at a group of people out of ignorance is bad, any way you slice it.<br>
<br>
This is my last post of the evening. It's been fun.  You all take care of yourselves and try not to get too sick from all that candy. =)<br>

<br>
Specific incidents....having to evac due to over pull and when we zone back in 6 members of vis had moved into the camp. argument proceded when we got back and I left in disgust.Truely its not worth the hassle. <br>
<br>
I fully admit I am arrogant in rl and highly Sarcatic...in game I at least hope I am humble...I try to stay in the background in game.<br>
<br>
Nice way to take bits and pieces of my comments and use them, you should e a writer for a newspaper.(read sarcasm) <br>
<br>
And to the we are all arrogant that includes me!!!! hmmmm all generally involes everyone wow amazing concept.(wow more sarcasm)<br>
<br>
And your saying I'm ignorant is smacking of arrogance...you do not know my histroy with your guild. You are defending by lashing out...<br>
<br>
I apoligize for saying the whole guild...when i meant the few members (a good dozen) of which only 5 are on ignore. No excuses I said something off in a moment of being slight peterbed. <br>
<br>
And isnt it arrogant to think your above me? Ins't that the stereotype given to the rich when they look at the poor....that they are better and above the common lot?<br>

<br>
Now to me that is arrogant to not even try and understand my history with the guild until much later...just to assume that It was only with one member. but that is me and my Opinion.<br>

<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Folks, quit reading into things.  All I said was that it was damn rude of Ffat and his group to march through us and take our mobs without asking... or even stating their intentions.  The fact that they didnt even make the first attempt to work with us was rude and inconsiderate.... period.<br>
<br>
Additionally, as far as Invis Seeing dogs go Ffat, maybe I was drunk, but I seemed to have noticed that the new Chardok dogs werent seeing my Invis.  Of course, since you at no point invised yourself, you wouldnt know that.  Again, thanks for the consideration.<br>
<br>
In closing, let me yet again restate (since if I dont, the next posts will prolly wind up being about the KKK, and the slaughtering of baby seals with wiffleball bats) ....<br>
<br>
It was damn rude of Ffat and his group to march through an established camp and slaughtering mobs in an established group's kill cycle without so much as saying hello.  You made no attempts to show ANY respect, consideration, or common courtesy... and you make me sick!<br>
<br>
And yes... Big Egos and Small Minds DOES apply to you.... and that has NOTHING to do with the guild tag you wear.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<br>

Shag - Good catch on the instance of Godwin's Law.  That provided a nice bellylaugh.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as the original post goes, the point which Quas was making was one of civility and not of 'guild'-ism (the latest in the parade of &quot;ism&quot;s to plague our fair lands).  Yes, he made a reference to the &quot;Vis guild group&quot; but it was not an anti-Vis statement but rather an anti-group one.  The group just happened to have been made of Vis folks.  The object of his story was &quot;the Vis group&quot; of which Ffat was part.  He never made disparaging remarks about the guild.  If someone infers from his remarks that the entire guild is responsible for that group's actions, then that mistake in logic is theirs and not Quas'.<br>
<br>
As far as the rest of the comparisons to past and present day evildoers (the Germany and Afganistan things) - that's just sooo uncool.  Drop that stuff from this board and lets try not to associate death and destruction with that of this game.<br>
<br>
One last thing to remember - stereotypes and stereotypical actions don't appear out of nowhere.  There is always a basis in fact, however small, upon which stereotypes are derived.  If ones allies themselves or joins a group of people who have a certain stereotype, then it is that person's burden to bear the brunt of that stereotype AND CHANGE IT if he/she cannot cope with the stigma.  By falling into the comfortable arms of complacency and making no attempt to right the wrongs of one's ancestors, you are only perpetuating the stereotype.  And that, dear reader, is the travesty.<br>
<br>
Anyway, good people are out there.  Bad people are out there, too.  The goal is to embrace the prior and educate the latter.  It's how *you* react to bad situations which determines your own moral fibre.  And playing the game well is what it's all about.<br>
<br>
Play well.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  Ffat, as far as your challenge of knowing who the Vis folks are, I think I qualify to answer you.  I've never been a big fan of Vis Maior.  But the guild has its stars.  Take Chikkin for instance.  Damned nice guy.  I've known him for a while and he's a good egg.  I've met quite a few Vis people in my 2.5 years on Quellious - I can't say that I've had a good experience with many of them.  Occy seemed to be a decent guy but has failed to impress me.  Karre has always been good to me - never a problem with him.  Poper was a good guy too.  Baaguk, Ggan and Ffat I've actually grouped with before and I had good experiences all around.<br>
<br>
However, I DON'T remember the faces of the many dozen times Vis members have been unsportsmanlike and downright rude to either myself or someone next to me.  Those nameless folks found their way into the pile of stereotypical debris normally reserved for my &quot;No Rez&quot; list.  Yes, it's a shame but at the same time, it's normal.  Bad players will exist no matter what their guild or affiliation.  In the immortal words of Winston Churchill, &quot;@#%$ is as @#%$ does.&quot;  (ahahaha... no, fair pundits of history, he didn't really say that.. I just made that up.)<br>

I've already apologized for that misunderstanding; I saw you guys were in downtime and my group wanted to move through.  That was a mere misunderstanding, but I don't really see how much we inconvenienced you besides helping to break up some of your spawns.  There were still plenty of spawns down the tunnel, etc.  Regardless of whether or not invis would have worked, if we had started to make our way down there and just 1 person's invis dropped (thnx random timer), we would have had a train on our hands, not to mention any new see-invis mobs.  As you can see there are lots of ways an invis disastor can happen; it was not a viable option.  Also, you can see that there are many points of view on a particular subject.  There was no need, however, for the comment made, and yet it was made anyway.  That's why I thought the following needed to be said.<br>
<br>
My argument is against statements like these:<br>
&quot;vis bashing woo hoo always fun to do....&quot; and the fact that the &quot;big egos small brains&quot;, whether directed only to my group or to all of vis at this time, has been a common sentiment given by many people on this server towards Vis, and any other labels put on other guilds.  Therefore, whether or not it was directed at vis or just me/my group, I felt it needed to argued.  Here's the argument.<br>
<br>
Stereotyping people because of things you've heard or have seen from a small percentage of those people is bad.  Somebody said, a couple posts ago, &quot;if you're part of a group start to change it&quot;.  The sheer numbers of the people in the given group and peoples' already cemented opinions of them, make this very difficult.  In &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, the narrator has to contend with the racism from wherever it comes from, whether his own kind or from white people.  No matter what he does, he's labeled as what he is without people trying to understand him for who he really is.  Wherever this labeling occurs, violence and sometimes death takes place.  I'm saying this is how it starts.  You label a group of people, Vis, as &quot;assholes and powergamers&quot; then every time you see a Vis person you think &quot;big ego, small brain&quot; or &quot;oh boy let's bash this person because he's in Vis&quot;.  Then an anti-vis group formed, and eventually hate tells etc. start happening to these Vis people.  This is what I'm talking about because this is what the thread was turning into.<br>
<br>
I hope this reiteration of my previous points is more clarified; I apologize if my point was not getting across correctly.<br>
<br>
As for whatever law was found, you simply saw the word &quot;Hitler&quot; and decided that my post was bullshit.  Try to think for yourselves and not do stuff like that.  You can't just use that law that somebody else made up as an argument against mine.  That's just saying you're not making your own thoughts and actions and letting somebody else do it.  That is not a defense.<br>
<br>
For the last time, this was NOT only directed towards those people I've offended, whether they deserve it or not.  I've already apologized for the misunderstanding.  This is directed towards everybody, whether you participate in this kind of behavior or not.  It's just something I see that comes up a lot in human nature, has come up on the boards, and frankly I'm tired of watching it.  Please stop it.<br>
<br>
I want to thank Herrick for his responce, he hit it right on the nose.  &quot;Basically I show just as much respect to VM as I do any other guild or player.&quot;  I've shown respect by apologizing already; that's what I'd do for a VM member as I'd do for anybody.  This is what I was hunting for.<br>
<br>
Daku and Quas, thank you for actually trying to answer some of my questions and developing a good argument.  However, the analogies I brought in are extreme examples like I've already said.  I'm talking about people who stereotype - this has gone beyond that of a the simple misunderstanding we had that night, of which I had and have apologized (I'm sorry for the mess down in Chardok.  I hope you read this this time).  Also, the analogy was brought in simply as an extreme example of one type of behavior.  I already said, I don't believe these people would commit the atrocities I mentioned.  But how much does it take?  You have to remember that each and every one of these atrocities was commited by a human being from the same human behavior that has caused the nonsense Vis bashing I've seen since they had started on the server.  This is not just about this post or simply Vis for that matter, this is about human behavior.<br>
<br>
Gaelron - You missed my point bro.  This has nothing to do with just VM or this particular issue.  It has to do with any type of labeling.  I don't think 95% of the server is out to bash VM; on the contrary, 95% of the people I run into are extremely nice and would give Herrick's response.  However there is that 5% or however many there are that have developed this labeling issue, and I run into them and get to hear flak from them, or I hear other guildmembers get their feelings hurt and tell stories.  This is what this post is about.<br>
<br>
This may not be suited to the original post, but when I saw the &quot;oh boy, vis bashing what fun&quot; post, I wanted to give all my thoughts out on the table.  I'm sorry if I confused you, but keep in mind this is not only about the incident in Chardok.<br>
<br>
I don't know what else I can say on the subject.  I've tried to repeat words and ideas a few times so people will read them, but that just doesn't happen.  I just want everybody to watch out for stereotyping/hate and think for themselves so any type of hate can be avoided, whether towards a group or a particular person.<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>

and btw, VM earned their rep and their hatred from other players. i have been, and have seen, VM push around other players so often its sickening. i'm not saying ALL of vis is bad, i have a few friends in there. but generally the population of the guild is NOT respectful to other players. dont automatically assume we FEAR vis and therefore hate vis. i dont know anyone that fears vis lol. but i know MANY people including me, that have been stepped on and pushed around by vis. <p><B><FONT COLOR="#009900" SIZE=-1 TYPE="ARIAL"> ~Nitrouz Oxidiouz~ <FONT COLOR="#999999">60 Warder of Karana ~ Half Elf Bastard Whore of Quellious<BR>"He was there, and then he faded into the forest... leaving no trace that he had been there... just like that he was gone<BR><BR>
