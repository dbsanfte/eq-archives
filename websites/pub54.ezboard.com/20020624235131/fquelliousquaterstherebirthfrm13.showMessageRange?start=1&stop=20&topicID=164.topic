He says to ask Field. He says im 1st on the list. (well obviously there's no one in the zone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) So after a short while Shihhan tells me someone is leaving and i should be up. So i ask Field should i come up now? He states im next on list and their are no openings. One person from US leaves and is replaced by a guildy of Fields. I pretty much blow this insult off it happens alot in this zone. <br><br>Not long after another member leaves and I am finnaly invited. From the moment i enter the group, Field is whining like a 2yr old who needs a nap about everything in general. Fine nobody is perfect at least he knows where the complete heal button is. Soon velks has 15 people in it and some come up and ask to get on the list (lists suck but what ya gonna do?) Field informs them he has 19ppl on the list and he's not adding anymore. Now i can count on two fingers the number of people who came up and asked to be on the list and i checked no GM /broadcast Fields US group now making a list So i dont see how he has 19 people on it. /who all &lt;hisguild&gt; shows 8 total members online. This is where i did wrong. I should have spoken up when he lied i did not. <br><br>Time goes by and Field keep whining. So i do what i always do with complainers, i tease the @#%$ outta them. Nothing nasty just small ribbing that most normal people can laugh at even when they are the brunt. Things like /em plays a really small violin for Field and would you like some cheese with that whine? Apparently Field is taking these as major insults so he decides to complain some more. He tells me my pull message is offensive (a montyy python refrence &quot;I fart in %T's general direction&quot;) Christ if he finds THAT offensive i suggest he NOT get HBO. But hey i stop using it cuz we all know just utterly foul that kind of language is.<br><br>Now also during this time Field has decided that any spider he see's engaged or not should be his. Including pulling spiders from INSIDE BR's camp while they are busy with others. So i start giving him some @#%$ about it but it doesnt help. At this time as well, several people have moved on from the group to be replaced ONLY by his guild members. That's fine really but dont tell people they're on a list when they arent. Be honest and tell them you arent keeping a list. But alas honesty is lost on the stupid. So after my 3rd cheese refrence, he boots me from the group. His reasons (this is the best part)<br><br>1. I was making sexual jokes (nope Puvil wasnt in the zone and i save those for him)<br>2. I called him gay (nope i wouldnt insult gay people like that)<br>3. I was harassing him (must have been those imaginary tells)<br><br>One of the other members who had witnessed the event quit the group in disgust at Field. I send a tell to an officer in his guild concerning this nut job. Which im sure this officer did the smile an nod thing (hey no biggie people have more important things to do than listen to someone rant about the stupidity of a member) Afterwards i start getting tells that Field is saying he knows me in RL and i got fired from my job for sexual harrasment. &lt;pause for effect&gt;<br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA... wait....<br>AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH oh damn that's funny.<br><br>I shouldnt even dignify his stupidity whith a response but i will anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   1st off ive had my recent job for close to two years. I just recently left them (with 2 weeks notice and the option to re-hire thank you) For another job with less hours and tuition reimbursment.<br><br>So i ask Field what exactly he's saying. To which he replies that that's what he heard from someone who knows me. a WHOPPING 2 people who play EQ know me. My roomate who doesnt play anymore and an old friend i havent talked to in over two years and im not sure he really plays much either.<br><br>So to make a long story longer, i hereby deem Field @#%$ 6.5 with a major upgrade in stupidity over the previous models. And maybe just maybe his guild can set him straight.<br><br>Anywhoo this is a flame board flame on please!<br><br>Edit changed the title <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ulorddrunkeness.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Drunkeness</A> at: 3/29/02 1:54:36 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/unervewracked.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NerveWracked</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Former Wave Caller</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/24/02 1:54:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=164.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Field</span><hr size=1> Moho has been modified yet again!?!

Hes been in guild a few months now, and is generally a very helpfull and good person. I like to call him a grump, as he always seems to be grumpy about something.<br><br>In my opinion, he shouldn't have booted you from group, and he shouldn't have misled people to think that they would be able to join to the group (this bothers me.. and will be taken care of). These i think were his errors. I dont support his choices in doing these things, although him being group leader -- it is his choice to disband you or not.<br><br>The stories im getting are somewhat conflicting. but mostly seems the same as the way your post went. Like i said, i talked to him -- but he is quite stubborn, hes going to do what he wants in situations like that.
