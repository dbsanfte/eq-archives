<br>
Anyways... whole point of this post is to post my thoughts/views on roleplaying. So here goes:<br>
<br>
I am a roleplayer.<br>
<br>
*hears the snorts of amusment from assorted friends*<br>
<br>
Let me explain. I do not mean in the sense that I use archaic speech or whatever, I mean in how I act when I am on one of my characters (and yes, I do act differently on different chars. Some more than others). I do not use 'thees' and 'thous' (well, unless I'm in a particularly whimsical frame of mind), I commit the apparently horrendous crimes of saying 'pls', 'thx' and 'ur'. I use |33+ 5p34|&lt; and various evil acronyms. If there's a way for me to type it quicker, I'll use it. Usually with misspellings (is that one 's' or two?).<br>
<br>
How dare I call myself a roleplayer? I hear you ask. It's simple. When I'm playing Mordi, I act like Mordi. In a lot of ways he's like me, which makes it easier (though hard-core roleplayers might say this isn't true roleplaying to play yourself.. /shrug). But regardless, there are several things which make Mordi, Mordi.<br>
<br>
1) He's a good guy. He has a *major* good guy complex, can't stand having bad faction in a good city. Willing to risk life and limb for friends and strangers alike. (In fact, I challenge anyone to name a time when Mordi turned down a cry for help. If he did, it was cos I was either helping someone else already, or asleep at the keyboard. Zaethliss on the other hand...)<br>
<br>
2) He's everything a barbarian warrior should be to my way of thinking (he got rejected from shaman school... his mother has never let him forget it either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). Strong, Loyal, Brave, Humorous (to himself at least), not overly bright, not to mention an absolute Stud. He has an ego the size of Norrath and then some. He thinks it's well earned.<br>
<br>
3) Generous. If someone does something for him, he rewards them. I rarely auction for a port for cash at first. I'll normally just &quot;/ooc Looking for a port to WC&quot;. If someone offers me the port not looking for anything in return, they'll likely find themselves around 100pp richer plus if I notice anything I have in my packs for a twink is an upgrade for them, they'll get that too. SoW, likely 20ppish. If I'm forced to auction a value for a port, then there are no fringe benefits. I'll quite often go into a newbie zone and unload any gear I have on me. I truly, truly, truly hate selling gear (I got my fill when I was a little tacker... level 9 warrior with a langseaxe in hand, a spare in the pack and mixed armour.... ahhh the good old days) so I prefer to give it away. Never to beggars of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So... all this (to me at least) makes me a roleplayer. I have an avatar and I play it the way I think it should be played (My secret is out... I'm not that funny, sexy or dumb in real life!). I may not play it the way AD&amp;D'ers might, but then there's no right and wrong way to roleplay.<br>
<br>
So, the whole point of this is... how many people out there consider themselves roleplayers? And how does your type of roleplaying differ from the 'standard' roleplay?<br>
<br>
Just wondering if I'm a no good freak, or if there's others out there like me! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13112">Mordi Tashkarii</a><br>Warlord<BR>

By that, I mean that I created personas and background stories about my characters.  I played both male and female characters of different classes, races, and alignments.  What they did and what they said was mostly determined by who they were in game not who I was in RL (although who I am in RL definitely had an impact on the characters that I created.)<br>
<br>
As my main and secondary characters got older and grouped more with non-roleplayers, I found it harder to stay in character especially during combat and raids.  The game is somewhat to blame in that there are few rewards for roleplaying and unless you play on a PvP - teams or deity server, you mostly likely will end up grouping with someone whom your character would never give the time of day ordinarily.  I still roleplay but the level to which I do so is based on who I am with at the time.  The more you act like a barbarian warrior, the more I will act like a barbarian shaman <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Juror<BR>

It is very hard to roleplay, I gave up at 20th or so saying &quot;Knight of Darkness from the 20th tier looking for companions to pillage the bird men of the Karanas&quot;.  55th sk lfg is so much easier, but I generally only use the ooc channel for that stuff and do tend to try and maintain myself as a wayward mercenary and practitioner of the eldritch heretical arts.  It is hard to maintain with the &quot;Dood&quot; players, but when you do run into the few that make an attempt it can make for great fun.  I find some of the ironies that exist in the game were certainly self defeating for roleplaying purposes (i.e. Ghoulbane on the Froglok paladin, with all the do-gooders killing him for it does present a conundrum for the ethos most paladins profess).  It's a bit easier for evils...except when we are being charitable or overly generous, when I give a pinkie something I have.  I had a real problem killing my god, until I realized what better way to venerate his teachings and visioin than patricide.  I remember once running into a necro that would refuse to interact with our group in najena unless we roleplayed, &quot;Are you camping so-and-so&quot; wouldn't get a respone, but &quot;We hear so-and-so is rumored to dwell here, are you awaiting their return?&quot; would.<br>

I have stories that cover the background of all of my characters on Quellious. They all tie into each other at one point or another, pending on the level of the character. <br>

I tend to play my characters as individuals, but they are all basically good. I try to go out of my way to help people if I can spare the time, and I had a blast once in Everfrost doing a quest for newbies in roleplay, and giving out rewards. I remember not too long ago I was traveling thru NK and a little warrior needed a bind. When I got to the gypsies, I roleplayed the whole conversation, and to my surprise and enjoyment, he went along quite well with it. Then I proceeded to give him buffs, also using roleplay. Needless to say, I enjoyed the interlude, and it made the long-assed trip to Halas seem a bit shorter. I like being flexible and being able to just be myself, or roleplay a situation, but even then, I am still me just in the circumstances I have created. It may be fun to create a Dark Elf and just be evil all the time...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Tis the question I always ask meself before I hit the button on this board....<br>
<br>
I'm a roleplayer. Always have been. I craft a different personailty, accent, an' speech pattern fer each o' me toons. I stay dead in character wi' em on raids, big hunts, solo, groups o' friends, strangers, etc. I use acronyms, dinna use &quot;ur&quot; or &quot;dewd-speak&quot;, an' dinna give two shites if some piker in me groups doesna like it.<br>
<br>
Aye, I've backgrounds stories fer me toons. I've reasons why they hang out wi' the folk they always hang wi'. Family lines, etc, people I, like a lot o' role-players, am generous wi' time, money, gear, etc. Heck, I'll e'en give te a beggar if they rp it well.<br>
<br>
An', before ye decide that I'm bein' pretentious, there's quite a few folks on these boards that know me well enough te say that I type like this all the feckin' time =)<br>

Me point te this ramblin' an' pixellated organ wavin', is that ye can roleplay wi'out bein' a goob, wi'out usin' the hated &quot;thee&quot; or &quot;thou&quot;, an' still communicate effectively. Tis mostly how ye think ye sound. The voice I normally use (an' sign te me posts) is that o' me main, Bulvai Hammersson, Initiate o' the Tribunal o' Justice (Barb shaman). I always think o' him as havin' a thick Scottish burr. Works fer me, feck em if they dinna like it.<br>
<br>
Me guildmates took te callin' me accent &quot;Bulvaic&quot;. It generated a lot o' good jokes, funny posts, people jibing me. Doesna matter. Part o' roleplay is havin' the good humour te accept the consequences o' bein' a tad different from the 31337 ones what dinna think roleplay has a place in EQ.<br>
<br>
The finest reward o' role-play? Seein' yer mates start te do it. While I'll not claim te be the sole reason why a lot o' me friends started role-playin' more the more they knew me, I will say that me use o' accents an' speech patterns caught on. More'n one o' me mates used &quot;aye&quot; an' &quot;nay&quot; instead o' bland &quot;yes&quot; an' &quot;no&quot;. More'n one uses distinct an' consistent colloquialisms. More'n one is bold enough te have a skosh o' flavour now.<br>
<br>
Mission accomplished.<br>
<br>
As an aside, some o' the finest roleplayers I've met used not noticable accent at all. What made them good was the fact that ye could tell a serious difference when they switched toons. Hell, I know one bloke what had two toons in the same guild fer almost two years an' not a soul knew they were run by the same player. That's role-play =)<br>

But as many of you have stated, it just gets hard to roleplay every day.  The only roleplaying I do now is giving my characters different identities.  My ranger hates my cleric and flames him in every zone for being a greedy selfish ass for not rezzing him (they're on same account btw).  My bard, who at 15 wears better gear than my cleric, acts like a true n00b and is amazed with everything he sees.  And Gaeaan, well G's either an ass or a hella guy dependin on who ya talk to, but I love playin him.  But if I truly feel like roleplaying, I log in the ogre, just cuz it's so damn easy to roleplay a fatty &quot;Barshen be guud&quot; <p><Br>Gaeaan<Br>The Simpler Templar<Br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22094" target="_blank">GUBER Gear(tm)</a>

<br>
They all have completely different names and different personalities.  That is why I do not let others know who my alternates are (with the exceptions of guildmates) to keep them true so to speak.<br>
<br>
Since roleplaying does take much typing... it depends on the the situation I am in on how much I actually do roleplay.  But in the end, they each stay true to their characters and respond to their comrades and situations how I created them to.<br>
<br>
It is much fun.  Although some people just do not understand roleplaying at all.  I am starting to keep a tally of how many times my stuck up High Elf Enchanter has been called the B-word just because she lets everyone know how beautiful she is.  Oh she has a huge ego alright.  The guys like her... it is the gals that have problems with her... go figure. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In conclusion,  the game is very enjoyable if you get into your character.<br>
