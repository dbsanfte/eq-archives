Ok, I was not the center figure in this incoddent but there were over 40 (FOURTY) of us and I was just the first to get here.  The plan was to meet in SG at 8pm EST Aug. 11th. to go to POM for a week long raid. You wont understand what happened until you have read to the end of my post (short post this time).  That being said..<br>
<br>
Koyork.. She is one stupid #$)!# #!)@# of a @($#@ @#$)(# mother.  She #$(@'s #$)@# for fun, and eats @)$#@ $@)!(#! during her spare time.<br>
<br>
This is the 2nd time she has done this to Koly and I too.<br>
First time was about 2 weeks ago when we were going to take 2 groups up early and we waited.. waited.. waited for her to find out that she had fallen ASLEEP!<br>
Then came tonight. The raid started PROMPTLY at 8pm EST.  EVERYONE was there on time.. EXCEPT Koyork.   She knew she was the only one able to get us in, and she had to leave to go eat dinner.  THEN, when she logs back on, she is invited to a Vox raid and goes on that leaving us high and dry to wait for her for 3 hours.  10 o'clock rolls around. VOX IS DEAD! WAHOO! She is comming!  11 o'clock rolls around, Koyork decides that she is NOT comming and bails on us.  She ruined 40 players weeks, and 3 hours of our personal time!  What a #)@$@ @!)$#.<br>
<br>
I requested off of work 1 month ago for tonight.  Well, that may not seem so bad, but where I work we are REALLY short-handed.  Infact, only 2 people work in my department, so I stuck 1/2 the day to someone who knew what they were doing, but the other 1/2 the day someone had to cover for me cause I wasnt there, and he had no idea what he was doing!  You can begin to understand how angry I am with Koyork.  And you all know, i am sure.. that I have temper problems <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   (j/k)  But this is seriously disappointing.<br>
<br>
Her name is KOYORK &lt;Pretorians&gt;.  DO NOT trust her for anything.  She too, can burn in the pits of HATE. <p><b>Stehe McNorn</b>

Ya they had a BIG crew going... it still sucks to be left like that.<br>
<br>
Only a few of them were gonna stay (so I'm told)... while the more ppl up there means the less stuff for the ppl up there, I definitely feel bad for Kolyenyo and others who waited so long for tonite just to get ditched like that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If PoM is gonna get ruined because of overcrowding, it's not the ppl going there that should be blamed, it's the design of the zone.  Everyone that can make it there deserves to check it out, it's a nifty place... (just don't expect much loot and come to play nice, please)<br>
<br>
I feel really bad for all you guys on the raid.. Kolyenyo and I talk a lot about PoM, and I know it killed him to get screwed like this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ukolyenyoriftkeeper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kolyenyo Riftkeeper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/12/01 4:46:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BAAGUK.. here is a new b*tch of a thread to read.. again</span><hr size=1> Aye, this bitch left us high and dry after uhm a month of assuring us she would be able to make it.. I know the zone can be done with 2 people and this was not much of an armor farm but for people who just wanted to check the zone out.. and BTW Nilerek, I am pretty sure I can solo most of the zone with a druid :P<br>
<br>
Well enough about that, some details.<br>
<br>
1) I contacted Koyork about a MONTH AGO giving her date times and she said she would be able to make it for tonight, AND for an earlier date.<br>
<br>
2) The earlier date, she SLEPT THROUGH, she apparently decided to take a little nap on a Kael raid (ROFL) and slept through the time. If she had not slept through, we would have indeed been the first ones into Mischief <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
3) Talking to some people in Pretorians she apparently likes to take naps a lot.. in fact she is afraid of being booted out cause that was the third (fourth, fifth, sixth?) time it has happened.<br>
<br>

I really do doubt I woulda ran all the way over to tov before she was actually there too<br>
sooner or later I'm gunna get my monky butt up there though, just you wait! the zone actually sounds pretty interesting and fun to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
hopefully on a run like this.. so I can have a dr00d to prevent cards from rotting.. but if it comes down to it, I'll get just my self in and go lfg and share cards like a good apeman <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
as for Koyork.. well I hope she dosen't end up needing help while anywhere near me.. it's not that she wronged me personally too badly.. more for the fact that she backed out AND waited till 2 hours after the set time to tell us she wasn't coming.. those kind of dick heads don't deserve help<br>

I went along on the vox raid to buff them (unfortunately) because I got asked nice and I'm a sucker.  I plead temporary insanity.  Koyork was supposed to be doing some cleric buffs, but wasn't able to handle that complicated job possibly due to being asleep, possibly afk, or possibly simply not caring I donno.  Then for a while she decided that telling people where they could sit was more important than buffing them.  Then she quit the raid and left the zone for a while I think, or maybe that was just hope.  But she was back in time for the dragon so she could get in on the loot, half of which was ninja'd anyway LOL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
