<br>
 i remember when i first met you.  it must have been 2 years ago at least, i was in a giant fort group in frontier mountains.  you wormed your way into the group by being annoying and harrassing us to let you in.  once you got in the group you were even worse.  then, a forest loop dropped.  this was very nice loot back then, and of course you looted it since you were looting every giant before it hit the ground.  well, we all agreed to roll, and the sweet poor druidess in the group, who had absolutely @#%$ for gear, won the roll.  immediately after this, you rolled again and laughed, oh look you beat her with your 2nd roll.  funny guy, right, so hand her the earring.  but no, you set up a hotkey to spam us with /ran 100s so that by the time we figure out you are stealing the loop from the poor druidess, the original rolls have scrolled off our text box so we can't /report the original rolls.  we do anyway, and i heard later that you were suspended for this incident.  don't know if that is true or not, but i hope so.  after you had spammed us to death and made it clear that you weren't giving the loop back, you had the gall to stay in front of the giant fort.  i think you even whined when i disbanded you from the group.  you are the only person i have ever cursed at in /shout.  later i had trouble getting into a guild because the guildleader saw that and thought bad of me, but when i mentioned it was targetted at Libra, he instantly changed his opinion.  <br>
<br>
anyway, i have a long memory and i still hate you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    that was unfortunately not the last time i saw you f uck innocent people over, just for your own sick sadistic pleasure.  You represent to me everything that is wrong with this game, and with the real world.  die please, many times, and rot in agony in whatever terrible place you will go when you are dead.<br>

Everyone on quellious who knows about this board seems to be posting about your loathsome character..  You've been called out for account hacking, ninja-looting, roll fraud, lying-- am I missing anything..? <br>
<br>
I find it hysterical that you are actually responding here, trying to do PR for yourself.  Do you actually think anyone here believes your drivel about you wanting to make amends and fix your trashed reputation..?  Much less, do you think anyone gives a s hit now..?  You've been called out on a flame board..  It's TOO LATE now, you silly little dumbass..!  You had ample opportunity to make amends in-game, but you never figured the people you jerked around would actually remember you, and take what little recourse they have.  <br>
<br>
Now you're trying to smooth-talk your way out of your black hole of a reputation.  Well, you won't be forgotten..  You're name will always be on EQ flame boards..  You're deeds will be spammed in every zone you're found to be in..  Guildleaders, Groupleaders, Raidleaders, Grandmaster Tradeskillers, Clerics and MB wizzies will be alerted to your presence the moment you're seen in a zone.  It's little recourse, but it's what we have.  <br>
<br>
You f ucked yourself..  Live with it..

You don't remember all your scams.  Wow, that's a surprise.  After all, it must get confusing creating new characters all the time and trying to come up with different ways to ruin their reputation.  <br>
<br>
You want to be a model citizen now and make amends?  Sure, you do.  You got caught and betrayed someone who knows you in RL.  Boy, that was really dumb.<br>

You are a waste of pixels.  You have already taken up too much of our time.  You aren't worthy of more flames.  Why should we care or pay any more attention to you?<br>

I just feel you shouldn't be playing this game until you can pull your head from your scphincter and figure out who your loyalties are still to. If you really did return my stuff as an act of friendship and hoping to gain trust, I will tell you one thing. I am *not* a person who hates or holds grudges (except puvil, i still dont like him and never will. bastard =P ) , you of *ALL* people should know this man. When you f*ck up bad enough to get banned again, you know I willl be the first person you send the tell to, and the first person to help.  I know you can be a good guy, i've defended you and been on your side many times. Be reasonable about a few things. If I was you, take this one suggestion: For everything you've been &quot;accused&quot; , yes, not even if you have, ninjalooted, make a raid and get that person their item. From the gladiator armor, to the lodi map peice .  realize that saying things to help with your image will mean dick all to the many people who your greed has touched, but if you even make a sliver of effort to actually right your wrongs, then you will start to come back. Ever hear of Karma? I've had a short life but a shitty one so far, i beleive in karma and know eventually I'll be all right. You my friend have a dismal future =(<br>

If you want to talk to me, you know my email. I will talk to you about anything, I still do consider you as a friend, the good Michael I knew is who I remember, who helped me through some rough times when no-one cared. You can be a nice person man. Other times, you can be, well, as your name says, a fucktard.<br>

<br>
Acturian, it seems like you're a really nice guy, but Gnibblet is a boil on the ass of EQ, and needs to be lanced..  Look at how many people have posted about the many things he's done intentionally to jerk other players around.  He has a known history.  Being associated can only ultimately hurt your reputation too.  Helping him out will be helping him to f uck over others in the future..  Walk away, and let him fade away like the little fart he is... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uhappyflappy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>happyflappy</A> at: 6/26/02 1:31:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontaguethesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montague the Sorcerer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Social Butterfly </span><br>  Posts: 286<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/26/02 1:52:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=358.topic&index=30>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: boo</span><hr size=1> There are language filters on these forums for a reason, putting a space between the letters f and uck make no greater point than @#$%. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugypsysongman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gypsy Songman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Lout</span><br>  Posts: 242<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/26/02 2:07:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=358.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.houston.rr.com/neuromt/pwned.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: boo</span><hr size=1> Well yeah, there is a reason.

<br>
Yeah I did get a monitor, i posted that at Hopp's and am posting this at another friend's house, trying to get some AOL bullcrap hooked up so I can use it to get back to my guild.<br>
<br>
Happyflappy, I am a nice guy (at least I feel I am), and I dont like to hold things against people, or hold a &quot;grudge&quot; . In this case, I will remember forever what he has done to me , which effected me on a personal level. Even though it was a digital game, with fake items, it was still *MY* digital game and *MY* fake items, he commited theft against me , which I hold as one of the highest personal offenses one can commit, 2nd to murder and rape. If anyone that comes here knows me in the slightest, I wont turn my back on anyone , ever (except puvil, personally i smiled when I heard you quit, you made many weeks very hard for me. Puvil actually got his champion BP due to Beetten, just an FYI. Fucktards holdin hands, like kissin cousins), and except that small exception, I know you can be an enourmous selfritious sonofabitch but I feel if you turned around and even tried to fix HALF the @#%$ you made (without causing more) , you'd feel what I mean.<br>
<br>
You wanted my trust back, I told you that you would have to earn it. Understand I will never trust you half, or 99% as much . But even 1% of trust is a fuckin hell of a lot, A LOT more then anyone will give you back if they were in my shoes. Consider what Im saying, if you can attempt to fix the damage you've done, you wont heal old wounds, but dude the old wounds cant scar up if you keep cutting the same f'in spot. Use your head man, if I can find out all your info , imagine what others can do.
