Ill explain a bit of my side, and yes im <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   NOW</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> responding to accusations that i said didnt deserve a response.  Its late, and i feel up for a bit of arguing.  Gurunt was not there when Wraith killed the first taskmaster.  Gurunt probably didnt know that we had even done so.  The first TM aggrod on someone coming to camp from zone in, and was killed by people not yet in the loop on what was going on.  It was then explained to us by our leadership, and we went about waiting for them to try and handle a compromise with you all in tells, which apparently was bs, since lc had no intention of compromising...Salta you arent uncovering some &quot;scandal&quot;, grow up and act like an adult....<br>
<br>
The issue you so graciously formed this thread over is something better dealt with between officers of our respective guilds...not from some halfwit, who gets a boner from trying to look like a big shot on the messageboards...go ahead salta, throw out all your wraith sucks BS, and your lame attempts at being witty, it gives all something to laugh at.<br>

I'll talk with you privately.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fkin, I din't bring vis into this.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Salta, what Denia said isn't what I was told when I got involved, and what I was told was not refuted by Binedina.  What I was told I got from a number of LC folks as well as Wraith.  It's what you and Delores said happened yourselves in the first place. You and Delores said you attacked the first taskmaster here.   I was told you guys started killing them when Boldair and Binedina were talking.  I asked Binedina why you guys did that. I know we never made it a secret we intended cursed.  I know the only options available with you guys was we leave or we fight.  I talked with binedina awhile, and intend to talk more.  <br>
<br>
I need to  talk more with my side, too, apparently.<br>
<br>
I also take a different view about jumping on other ppl gathered somewhere for a raid than you seem to.  To me, not doing it isn't worth a merit badge.  When you do move in and provoke fights, fights is what you get.  It's like if you only steal from the corner store on Thursday, the 6 days you don't doesn't make you an honest customer.   We have never had a conflict where you guys gathered somewhere and we crashed.    <br>
<br>
We crossed paths with RiP on yeli twice.. once we both gathered and they got first shot, second time they had 12 people, we stayed away about 2 hours, they had less than 18, and we got him.<br>
<br>
All I care about is ending this crap.  I've got no halo to wear in this I'm pretty pissed at things on my side of the fence also.  Both sides acted shitty.<br>
<br>
I know we don't look for fights, but we don't back down easy either.   Both sides in this feel wronged.  <br>
<br>
At the end of he night  I had talked with Binedina awhile, we left the basement with an agreement, and we both seemed to want to work on avoiding stepping on each other's raids in the future.  Message board drama doesn't help.  Both sides have reason to be pissed.  <br>
<br>
I can only speak for my side when I say this is not the game we want to play in the future.  If you guys are determined to fight, then we'll fight.   We can't force each other to work peacefully, and we can't make each other dissapear.  I would rather we drop this here, and if you need/want talk to me in game.  I want to put all this crap in the past. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

<br>
As far as my reasons for posting.....  I post not because I get a big boner off of making certain people look pretty stupid.  If I did post to make people look stupid, I'd certainly pick a harder target than Denia.  I post because you all wasted 2 hours of my night on Monday.  I post because in your responses to Delores you made blatant lies (it couldn't have happened both the way Gurunt and Denia said, one of you is a dirty liar or just flat out ignorant).<br>
<br>
Anyways grats to Denia on using intelligent words like &quot;grow up and act like an adult&quot; mixed with accusations of me getting off on simple message board posts.  It's always great when someone tries to play the cool mature person only to realize their own words make them look that much more retarded.  On the one hand you repeatedly make references to me being immature.  On the other hand, I merely pointed out a discripency w/out getting into personal insults (something Denia can't seem to do).  I applaud your performance, the way in which you respond makes it that much easier to pick apart than someone who posts intelligently like Gurunt.<br>
<br>
Karma wins though as I assume you spent just as much time going to watch Vis kill creator as we did sitting around waiting for trigger repops.   <p>Salta

Just have three points to make.<br>
<br>
1) coordination between the guilds.  I believe the whole situation could have been avoided if we just all got along better.  LC and VM has a nice little relationship going, where we generally know where the other is going, and work stuff out so we both don't waste 3 hours fighting over a mob.  It ain't about asking permission or whatnot. just a little communication.  Going /anon or /role is silly at this level of the game, because 9 times out of 10, we know where ya going anyways.<br>
<br>
2) I am really glad LC got to kill the Cursed, cuz i got the Cloak of Dark Shadows off of it. NYAH!<br>
<br>
3) Ishan &gt;&gt; Tanithelas.  And I owe him an assbeating from waaaay back. (and if you read this Tanith, i wish stuff was no drop, so i can give you a weapon with a damage better than the delay)<br>
<br>
so to sum up:<br>
<br>
Communication is good.<br>
Ishan is good.<br>
Tanithelas sucks.<br>
<br>

      90% of your posts on this message board are either to fuel a flame or to start one yourself.  Dont try to play yourself out to be some valiant fact finder.  WTF is with the, 'grats on getting to watch VM kill the Creator!&quot; statement.  It seems to me that all your out for is a childish fight.<br>
<br>
     Everyone see's things in a different prespective, no one here was &quot;blatantly trying to lie&quot; or &quot;being ignorant&quot;, i was simply trying to state the truth as i saw it.  Maybe i was dead wrong, maybe we didnt kill a taskmaster first, maybe it was second, or third or whatever, i saw it from my perspective, and was trying to give my side of the story.  I now realise that things like this are better left alone.  These kind of arguments, especially with people like you, leave no one better off.  All it does is give drama happy people like you more fuel to flame off of...<br>
<br>
  Anyway, i await your next post, where you try to make yourself seem better than me.  Fun fun fun!!<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>

Well, If Denia is right, both me, you, and Delores were given misinformation by our people.  Delores and you both said you jumped the triggers first also.  Ledrone also has complete misinformation if he thinks your guys didn't know we were there for cursed, and thinks you had any intent other than to try to force us out.<br>
<br>
I know you guys knew we were there first, and knew we were there for Cursed, and made an informed descision to move in anyway.  Before you had one group in there, Binedina knew we were not backing off cursed, and that we had a crew that had been down there ahwile while we got ppl on for cursed.   I got this directly from Binedina, and from logs from before you guys came to Ssra and she talked with our officer who was already there.  It wasn't something Binedina was happy or gung-ho for, but both sides wanted that mob, neither side was going to back down.<br>
<br>
My crew escalated it with the spawn sabotage... I don't consider us to have any room to talk ourselves up as the &quot;good guy&quot; after that.  That was a conscoius decision on our part to make the matter worse.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Vis was another issue Salta.  Please stop bringing them into this.  At the end of the day Ellise and I talked and things are worked out. <br>
<br>
<br>
The base problem is, you guys and Vis talk the day before/early and go your separate ways... you dont' talk with us.   This worked to an extent for awhile cuz you were still killing things we hadn't progressed to yet.  Now, we are killing the same things, and if you go one way, Vis goes another, one of you is bound to run into us.   Most conflicts with any raiding guilds happen when one steps up into anothers level.  When new folk start making ST keys, when new folk move in to ntov the first time, when new folk start working (&quot;blowing&quot;) AoW spawns, whenever new folk start killing anything that someone else has on their 'priority mob' list. <br>
<br>
That's why there is &quot;wraith hate&quot; pretty much.  When SOL came out Wraith was barely farming Juggs and PoG armor.  To come out of nowhere and grow and improve as fast as we did.... in the last 4 months we've hit every 'hot spot' encounter there is.   The only way to avoid this kind of conflict is to not do the mobs.  <br>
<br>
Folks like Delores and Denia that seem to get thier kicks stirring up the pot on the boards is a separate issue really.  Notice they are both relatively new to their &quot;uber guild&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I just want this over.  Talk with us. Sharing three ways isn't as good as sharing with two, but it beats the hell out of fighting over everything. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

I apologise for trying to stir the pot, that wasn't ever my intention, but my blabbering did seem to just make matters worse.  It just angers me when people make one sided posts or stories, and i feel the need to defend.  I guess i should just realise that this is gonna happen and live with it....<br>

Communication is good and I agree. Trust me there are people on all 3 sides which want to avoid this and I for one promise to make a better effort in future. We must co-exist more amicably or we'll all just burn out faster. <br>

Grats on the cloak Ishan. All others, please give it a rest. <br>

You're right. It may not have happened if someone spoke up the day before. So why wait for someone else to take the initiative and see for yourselves that you're a guild worth acknowledging through someone else's eyes? &quot;The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Man</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is trying to keep us down&quot; attitude is getting a little old. Admit it. Vanity is a hindrance except for the occasion[s] when you get to cry fowl play. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/unajir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Najir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/10/02 12:57:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get your stories straight~</span><hr size=1> I dont think Tattle was lying when he said we all were under impression that you were there to do ore/mines and key parts.<br>
Despite the apparent lack of communication, LC clearly had the larger engagement force there ready to take on Cursed cycle. Just by PnP alone we could have started the cycle. It was clearly evident that your guild attempted to hijack the spawn by holding a taskmaster &quot;hostage&quot; and not killing him, thus blowing the spawn for us, and buying you guys more time to get people there.<br>
<br>
You KNEW you didnt have enough people for cursed, and instead of give it up (as PnP states), you decided to be nasty about it and try and blow the spawn for us.<br>
<br>
Its the actions of your guild officers in instances like this that shape the server's opinion of you. Theres no wonder you are regarded so poorly by the server population, due to your childish acts like these. Apparently you guys were never taught to &quot;share&quot; or &quot;play nice&quot; when you went through kindergarden.<br>
<br>
LC and Vis have a working relationship on spawns just for this reason, so that we dont bump heads like this. Our officers are mature, and know its better time spent looking for other spawns than fighting, which is why we set up the system in the first place.<br>
<br>
So now a new kid enters the sandbox and needs to learn how to share. As your guild gets more efficient at taking down spawns, the one thing they havent done is to get more mature, particularly when relating to others. Maybe its time you guys got some new officers who are more mature and work well with other people, so that you can better interact with LC and vis, so that things like this dont happen again.<br>
