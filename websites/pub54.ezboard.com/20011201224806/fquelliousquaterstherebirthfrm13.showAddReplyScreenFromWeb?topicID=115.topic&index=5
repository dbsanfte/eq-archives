One of the 2 continent rez requests I had was done in complete RP, everything he said right down to his thank you and the offering of dots at the end.<br>
When he approached me with his almost paragraph tell asking me for a rez 2 continents away I was so impressed I didnt think twice about paying for a port to get to him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
hehe I use that one all the time..<br>
<br>
&quot;Sure I'll res you, can you drag to me?&quot;<br>
 <br>
I have gotten tells from people that say, &quot;OK&quot; then about 10 min later they say, &quot;I cant drag through the zone, can you come to me?&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Honestly I'm a little tired of this &quot;Pissed Clerics Club&quot; that seems to be forming, two posts in the last what..month or two? <br>
You make a cleric to help people, eer didnt you? <br>
I mean who would lvl a character whose class is completely dependent on other players and was obviously designed to help other players then get pissed all the time when people ask for help? <br>
Yes, it can get frustrating, I have even flamed as a cleric on these boards, but it was only about a paragraph and it was only about ONE thing...<br>
People asking for a res., you traveling a couple zones to do it and wait while they pull their body only to give them a tell about 20min later asking them how its coming for them to say &quot; oh I got a res., thx.&quot; I got that twice in one day. <br>
<br>
It wasnt a list of requirements 12 paragraphs long that seems to be floating around through clerics heads these days, sorry for ranting at a rant, you are prolly just blowing off steam.<br>
Do a couple push-ups turn that negative energy into laughter. <p><BR><img src=http://sachem.freewebspace.com/images/sasig1.gif><BR>

I've always went out of my way to rez someone a couple of zones away.  It's the requests to run my butt 2 continents I'm complaining about.  And as for the &quot;Hail, friend&quot;.  The ppl that send these to me, don't know me, and as soon as I heal them and wait for rez effects to drop so I can leave I never hear from em again.  And Raalf, that greeting would actually work a lot better on me just cuz I woulda laughed.  I had one guy send me a tell &quot;Yo, rez bitch&quot;.  I rolled and then went and helped him out.  And as far as helping ppl out, it's why I play a cleric.  Just don't get pissed at me cuz I won't leave my raid, run 10 zones, look for your corspe for 2 hours because I can't find that tree you died by, and not accept a donation.  Like I said, common sense, most were blessed with it. <p><Br>Gaeaan<Br>The Simpler Templar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/udakuinochi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daku Inochi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/29/01 4:50:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Rezzes and You&quot;, brought to you buy Wakarez(t</span><hr size=1> I think that Gaeaan posted this tidbit here (in the Flames section) BECAUSE of the sarcastic rant nature of the post, so admonishing him for it's placement might not be the best example of someone's situational prowess. <br>
<br>
And as far as any assumptions that he &quot;became a cleric to help people&quot; goes, there is a basic flaw in that theory.  We became clerics because of the abilities of the class and the potential to make a good group great.  Rezzes, heals and buffs are the main tools employed by clerics but are by no means the only ones.  Clerics can solo quite often if given the right circumstances and available zone mobs.  (And if it goes sour, we can just rez ourselves! )<br>
<br>
We became clerics because it is our nature to help others - our friends and groupmates as well as to roleplay as a character &quot;with divine goodness&quot;.   (Ever since my days of Gary Gygax' D&amp;D games my main character has ALWAYS been a cleric.  After 20 odd years of doing it, I'm damned good at it too.)<br>
<br>
But this does not mean that we have to help every single Norrathian who trudges our way with corpse and/or sad story in hand.  The time spent (notice the careful choice of verb) in EQ is of paramount importance - it's my two and a half year investment in effort.  How and when we spend our time helping others is our choice.  There is no rule which says that &quot;all porting/rezzing classes MUST help others&quot;.<br>
It's a choice we make - and not by ANY means a requirement.<br>
<br>
The balance we strike up when we choose to be a buffing/rezzing cleric is that we are limited in both combat and travel abilities.  Naturally, these two types of characters should want to support the other since we are always looking for the other's help. <br>
<br>
Right?  Right!<br>

I agree with you both. As a non cleric (I have one level 6, so she doesn't really count yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and someone who occasionally needs a port or a rezz for someone in need, I am on the receiving end of the great clerical (and druidic) abilities. From the perspective of someone who would ASK for services, I myself realize the time invested, and how time consuming helping others can be (I do it when I can with my Shaman, and have even died helping do CR in the dumb undead zone off of WC). I would not expect a cleric to come running across two continents EVER, unless they knew me personally, had the time, and I was completely desperate. I also do not ever expect a cleric to come running even in the same zone. I do not generally expect to give nothing in return. If I am going to take time out of a cleric's day, I will make it as easy as possible, and if I have means, give them something in return of use, be it pp or sow potions (or peridot, which I will start keeping a stack of at all times). When asking a cleric for anything, we don't know what they are doing, and it is not fair to assume that just because they CAN do, doesn't mean they have the time. There are times when clerics are just hanging around, and most jump at the chance to help someone, but it is not a requirement. I have probably asked 40 different clerics for rezz's at one time or another. I do the /who cleric thing, and check zones. trying to get someone as close as possible, if they are more than one zone away, I don't even bother them. Then I send personal, respectful tells. I have never gotten a rude response, and I have always accepted declines with grace, thank them for their time. I can respect that someone is busy. I don't spend all day hanging out doing nothing, why should they? I have actually gotten clerics to come in from another zone to rezz someone, and I showed my gratitude, thanked them for their time, made sure they were compensated. As a Shaman, I rarely have time to run across a zone to buff someone, much less go to another zone to do it. I would expect no more of a cleric. There are a lot of wonderful people that are clerics, who help us in so many ways. We shouldn't take advantage, and we should respect their right to play when they want, and how they want. And as for those people who don't use their head when asking for someones time, it's their loss, and they only serve to make me look better when I ask. Keep it up! lol<br>
