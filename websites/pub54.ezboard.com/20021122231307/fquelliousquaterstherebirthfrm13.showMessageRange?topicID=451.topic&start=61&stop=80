<br>
You'll notice that when Verant thinks things are abused they are nerfed... <br>
<br>
Take Nagafen and Vox for example. Verant was worried it would be too easy for high level characters to kill Naggie and Vox so they said, &quot;Ok, if your 53+ you get booted from the zone when you have aggro from them.&quot;  I don't think they meant Kunark dragons to be a piece of cake either, but who can tell the minds of those at VI?<br>
<br>
AEing in many dungeons as well. The Grey and Acrylia were both changed to make it unsuitable for people wanting to AE.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there's more, but I'm not willing to sit and dig through my past 3 years of EQ experience to try to remember them all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

-- Gurunt quotes<br>
<br>
That's 5 more chances than Gray Soldiers had to pull CT. =P I would assume that, if DB wasn't in the zone in full force when Jama started, they would definitely have enough people for the kill by the last try. During those six tries and alleged trains, Jama didn't hear anything about DB's intentions?<br>
<br>
&quot;Pala said in the first post Manteca sent him a tell saying if he got 20ppl he'd back off, and Pala replied saying ok, and they'll back off if he gets 20. So Jama tells the MB team he has a deal worked out with DB.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let's say that Palaz' guild made a mistake by jokingly saying they would back off if Manteca (or is it Mantica?) and crew got 20 people in. There are 2 discrepancies. Palaz said it occurred in OOC, Mantica said he sent Palaz a /tell. (As an aside, Mantica must've never intended to keep this promise. I may not know what all entails burning a Kunark dragon, but any player can guess it doesn't take more than 6 burners to bring the dragon down as MB teams gain widespread notoriety, or infamy in this case.) Which leads me to my next question: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> there 20 people on the burner side when the pulls began? So far, no one has eluded to there being more than 6 on the burn team. That means if this &quot;deal&quot; could be defended as a done deal between DB and the burners, the burners (and puller) did NOT hold up to their side of the agreement. <br>
<br>
&quot;How is this a Wraith flame?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, how is this a Wraith flame? I replied first not knowing or caring what guild the puller(s) was/were in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are the other MB wizards saying they had no idea DB was there? That the 6 times Manteca died pulling that caused the 2 trains they were ignorant of what was going on in zone?&quot;<br>
<br>
The other burners aren't saying much, just like your guildmate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sebilite Golem</span><br>  Posts: 665<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/5/02 5:58:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=451.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: trend</span><hr size=1> so much to respond to.. hope i remember<br>
<br>
First as stated before not everyone visits this board.. I didn't expect a statement from Ryohki but would like Wraith leadership to actually investigate the whole thing objectively and come to a conclusion..  Guild rep is important to me but I don't know how important it is to other guilds (not a flame).<br>
<br>
Mipp the manaburn channel is commonly hijacked so no one can use it.  There is a new channel I'm not suppose to discuss cause we want only good people in there. Also for people who are talking about the wizard channels.. There is usually no more than 5 people in the manaburn channel and the wizard channel.. Its not like we have twinks probing each zone when a dragon pop is near..<br>
<br>
We cannot police other wizards some Wizards are so bad they almost ruin the wizard name thats how Druids, monks and rogues got some bad reps too. People who don't respect others or who don't care about their play skills. We can't take these bad gamers out back and beat them.. The best we can do is come post here like Palaz did and spread the word... Guilds can do more by disbanding these people but it still isnt nearly enough.  Manaburn will probably never be nerfed.. Nerfing is ALWAYS a bad thing.. Cause you know verant likes to ruin completely things that are nerfed.  What happened to the days when people who called for nerfs were yelled at?<br>
<br>
You remember what necros use to be like or manastone?<br>
<br>
Some who said they were too overpowered but look at them now (no offense to the necros I think they are good)  <br>
<br>
Remember the paladin spell Thunder of Karana? Do you even know what it does now?<br>
<br>
instead of the continued and endless fighting can't we just remember that there will always be more dragons and there is usually a nice day outside.  Manaburn is considered balanced by the dev team so why do we continue to argue.. It won't change anything, but I do encourage people to post bad situations with burn raids so it all can get straightened out. This is what this board is for not to argue the same points over and over again in a endless manaburn thread but to bring those out who wronged and make them explain themselves.<br>
<br>
And I do trust Gurunt to find out what happened cause I'm sure he will want to know and I trust what he says on what happened.<br>

Point being if both sides agreed (joking or not) that they would back off if the other side got 20... neither side got 20, so neither side lied or did wrong on that count.   Neither side said they would not engage untill they had 20 ppl.  Either side could have engaged at any time...<br>
<br>
<br>
Pala says he responded to and acknowledged Manteca's offer, and in the same post says it never happened.  That is the biggest discrepancy.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's back to the &quot;is it fair that 5 wizzies can do what it takes 20 non-porters to do&quot; argument.  Whether or not the MB team should have taken Sev at all.   I do think the incident is fishy, but I don't buy that it's somehow all jama's fault.   It would require a lot of effort for mediocre loot from a guy that has next to 0 loot aspirations, and an incredibly stupid and deaf/blind MB team to pull off the way some ppl are making this out.  <br>

<br>
In Palaz' first post he says after the second train they had over 18 people in the zone and more coming. If you want to quibble with numbers Gurunt, go ahead and call Palaz an exaggerator or hallucinating pothead at the time this was going on. Deal or not, jokingly or not, you can't escape the fact any MBer or MB puller is lying through their teeth when they say they will back off if they are not capable of bringing 20 wizards in. Lying or stalling, take your pick.<br>

Which would mean loss of money and bad rep for Verant too.  <br>
<br>
As someone posted before not sure on this thread or another, When Naggy and Vox became easy and were doable by groups of 6 it was nerfed so those above lvl 52 couldnt participate.  They could very well nerf MB's usefulness on certain mobs and leave the skill there.  Do I want them to?  I dont really care at this point.  But then its not the mobs i want for epic pieces that are being Burned and its not my AA skill.  I feel bad for the people that are getitng shafted thanks to this skill though.  Albeit for some it makes things easier.  The good and the bad.<br>

<br>
     This is Azile.  Before I say anything at all, I'd like to apologize to all those that were trained, died, and didn't get to kill Sev.  I had no idea things were going as you state they were.<br>
<br>
    This was the perspective from which I saw everything...  Ryo sent me a tell asking if I wanted in to manaburn Sev.  I said &quot;sure&quot;, as all my big mob manaburning experiences had been good ones, thus far.  Ryo had told us that she worked a deal with the raid in progress that if they had sufficient numbers first, that we would back down.  I had no reason to believe otherwise.  She also told us that she had a druid puller, but that the druid had died.  She told us nothing of passing the other raid, or of training the other raid.  I can only assume that 1 of 2 things happened: 1) the training was accidental, in a failed pull, or 2) the training was malignant.  In either case, I see that the raid that was forming was sorely wronged.  I am sorry for that fact.  I will try to send tell to Ryo in game, and settle this with tells.  I suspect that Ryo may have been dishonest with me, but I don't want to point any fingers without having gotten the other side of the story.  In the meanwhile, I'd like to make ammends if I can.  The loot isn't that important to me, especially if so many people were hurt.  If the raid leader could send me a tell in game, I'd be happy to work out some type of compromise.  Again, what I'd most like to emphasize is that I am very sorry that people were needlessly and thoughtlessly trampled upon.<br>
<br>
         I am not likely to come back to this board, as I generally do not read the flame boards (eq can be stressful enough).  If you still take issue with me personally, then please send me a tell in game.  I am online MANY hours, and can be easily reached.  I'd much rather try to make ammends with people, than have someone angry at me.  Again, I'm so sorry things went so wrong.<br>
<br>

<br>
omg my name is in here.<br>
<br>
ok, heres my side of what happened.<br>
<br>
like azile i get a tell from ryohki asking if i want to mb sev, i figure sure since ive been promising noobas a green scale for 3 weeks now,and possibly ill get it today.so i port to ej and evac to our normal spot, i believe i was 2nd to last to arrive.i get rdy and sit and wait. in group after we got all settled and rdy were 5 wizards, no puller in group but was told we had puller so cool. someone in group mentions db in zone and ryohki says she made a deal with them that if they get 20 peeps in zone before we are rdy we will back off. i think they had like maybe 12-13 peeps in zone at the time, i honestly dont remember. then ryohki says sev inc so we get into position, puller dead. sit back down. get tell from pala asks me if manteca is in group or with us i say no,which at the time i didnt know was our puller.puller was bound in zone i guess so sev inc again pretty soon after death, another puller death. ryohki then tells us to follow her up a little closer cause her puller is to slow or something, i really dont remember, so we all move up, for some reason sev runs by us as we run to new spot ryohki wants us at, i figured our puller had her kited, this is when things get a little confusing,she said puller lost track so she has us following her around platue till we see sev again,we burn loot and bail.<br>
<br>
about 5 min goes by and i get a tell from pala,asking if we mbed sev, i say yes and he freaks. im like wtf, that was the deal wasnt it? he tells me what deal?  this is when i start to feel like shit and realize ive been duped.i should have known something was up,but being in the state of mind i was at the time, i had just woken up from drinking all night,and was excited to maybe get a scale for a warrior that has been watching for sev for 3 weeks, i didnt do what i normally would have. i didnt ask raid myself,i didnt question what i was being told. all mistakes i see now and i apalogize to db for this.i didnt win shit for loot that day, a dragon bone bracelet, but ill hand it over np regardless,what happened i feel isnt right and im ashamed of myself for not questioning what was going on.<br>

Is when the other raid was joking about the 20min thing Ryohki thought they meant it and went ahead like that and after the 20min tried to pull and died... guess the other raid was in the way or something and died... then kept trying to pull and finally got it.  <br>
<br>
Once again it seems there was a total lack of communication on both sides or atleast a misunderstanding..<br>
but again if a regular raid is already there... should just let them have it... all these rolling things and 20min things really arent fair to that raid... if wizards get it you got 30 disappointed people... if the raid gets it you got 5 disappointed people.. see the difference? There will always be more dragons that there is no raid at. <p><center>

<br>
now that you see im a good artist,most of the time raids gather on the steps,and the puller has to pull next to the steps to get the dragon to burners,lets say the pull dies sumwhere in the middle,dragon starts roaming back and bam aggros other raid if unlucky.Picture is not perfect but you get the idea.And about the nerfing thing,I was just proving that whatever VI does its usualy because money,and 2 of the things you stated(server changes and changin your name) costs 50 bucks,and alot of people would pay for that.<br>
