I was mad because they (Wraith in early 2001) told us one thing and did another.  Then when we complained, they basically said it sucks to be you... you aren't an uberguild so get lost.  We were there first but we weren't after CT and had no problems with them taking him as long as they waited for us to finish clearing other side of the plane.  I realize now that they were worried that someone else would come in and take CT if they were nice to us and kept their word.  I still don't think that excuses their actions but why in the world dig up ancient post?  Cuz we kill gods now?  <br>

<br>
My point is: <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  neither do I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. And I don't understand where you get the idea that I do. Where do I say 'OMG you must sux bcuz you have primals?' Where do I bitch and moan because I don't have something that you (or someone you know) do? I responded the way I did because you assumed that my post was driven by a blind hatred of &quot;uberness&quot;- there are a lot of people who can tell you otherwise.<br>
<br>
Am I inclined to fly off the handle on a message board, where what I say makes no difference and will be forgotten in a week? Yes, yes I am. Especially when I'm provoked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  This attitude is who you are Laur. You are bitter, you are hateful, you are jealous. I base this on your words, your actions, your lack of reason behind them.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, totally baseless. I am not bitter- life has not dealt me some evil hand. I'm certainly not hateful; I'm less inclined to hold a grudge and/or more likely to forgive people their pasts (and btw, you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> should learn the facts of things before you try to smear someone for them) than most, including you apparently. And as I've stated before, I'm not jealous. You evidently think that anyone who dislikes Wraith does so because they don't have what you do. <br>
<br>
You couldn't be more wrong.<br>
<br>
There are plenty of other reasons to dislike people.<br>
<br>
Words are just words, Gurunt, although in this medium they often mean more. You have yet to meet me in game, so you can't base anything on my actions. And I rarely do anything without a reason. All of this has been brought on because I made a flippant one-line post and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> went on the defensive and attacked <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  me</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>
<br>
And... thank you. You totally confirmed what I said about being a classless cretin.<br>

My opinion of you is not baseless.... you insult me and my team without provocation, without reason.   You fly fly off the handle.  <br>

Maybe you just act like an ass here but are totally different in game?  <br>

If I didn't have ppl I know in game confirming you are a real player, I'd think you were one of the SZ or brawl hawl fucktards.  You have all their class, wit, and maturity they do.<br>

You started insults with no basis.... you are the one being profane and flying off the handle.  You started the mudslinging on a subject Wraith did no wrong in over a year ago..... <br>
<br>
What did I do?  I *ASKED* why you have a problem, and got a kindergarden response, that did not include any form of answer.<br>
<br>
I cited an example of what *I* would consider grounds to think of someone poorly...  I named nobody, but obviously when I say &quot;harrasses women&quot;  SOMEBODY popped immediatly into your mind.  I do know more than one side and one source about that issue.   I think there is a glass house analogy that would fit here.<br>

You generalize about me and insult my intelligence, before I ever respond. You get defensive about a flip comment. And you insult my friend who did nothing more than defend me, and that quite reasonably. Sure, you didn't name names, but there isn't a person who reads this board that didn't know what you meant.

Hrm... I make a general and somewhat humerous statement, and you immediatly assume I'm attacking not only the then-Wraith, but the now-Wraith, for &quot;using the system&quot;. That reads like you feel guilty about something, to me.<br>

Edit: Oh yeah, and you're still insulting me, instead of trying to make points. I explained why I came back at you, perhaps a little more vehemently than was expected, and you continue to say that I bitch, moan, and insult with no point (despite the fact that I haven't actually bitched or moaned on this thread, and rarely on these boards). I have refuted the points you've made, and you continue to attack me personally rather than respond with new ones. If you'd like an example of how to deal with something like this for future reference, see Ketel's post.

My first post on this was &quot;wow that was a long time ago&quot;<br>
<br>
Your first post here was &quot;was this before wraith started sucking&quot;<br>
<br>
Flip comment?  No more so than saying the thread went over your head.  You responded in perfect Sullon Zek form.  <br>
<br>
Your friend has been a dick on more than this thread, for no reason.  To me and my guild, for no reason.  We did nothing to him, his guild, his friends.  He has driven friends of mine from this game.  I've had more than one friend come back  being careful not to let him know who thier new char was. That's all I'll say about that.  If he wants to mudsling, he needs to move out of the glass house.<br>
<br>
I admitted I made the apparently incorrect assumption it was petty jealousy.   There hasn't been an alternate reason for your ire given, but I will go along that it's not jealousy. <br>
<br>
You have yet to back one insult, one criticism with anything but &quot;I was responding to your response to my insulting you&quot; or &quot;just because&quot;.<br>
<br>
I don't feel any guilt over using the Ragefire system in place now.  It's no worse than ffa at this point.  It will grow to a 6 month plus waiting list, and I only hope Batto (who set up the boards) and company are up to the task of keeping it in order and don't try to pull a pick-and-choose of who can and cannot be a part o fit.  They are setting themselves up for a permanent job, I hope they realize.  <br>
<br>
I wasnt' part of wraith when they supported QQ.  I was part of QQ, and had a number of criticisms of that system by the end.  It was truly a best-effort attempt, but it got too cumbersome, and the game evolved to a point it could not work without being some kind of authority, and players being in authority over other players is never gonna work.<br>
<br>
What you apparently missed was, Wraith is being dragged thru the mud over questioning a new system..... By folks that helped break the last system... people with a history of breaking and abusing lists *exactly* like the ragefire one are pissing and moaning about Wraith maybe not wanting to follow *their* list, even tho wraith IS following their list.   Think about that.... <br>

Yes, it's got me short-fused lately... <br>

And, well, I made my first post for no other reason than just because. I could have left it off, but I didn't. After reading your last post, I think we've been flaming each other over a misunderstanding. <br>

You will have to forgive me for saying that the new Wraith sucks. In my experiences so far, I have been trained time and again, died a few times, and been wholly unimpressed so many times that I can't believe it was just coincidence. That, really, is my whole problem.

<br>
Ive been in the guild for a few months now...and ive yet to see us as a guild do anything to harm another guild or person.  Hell since ive been with wraith ive seen us help tons more than anything..but for some reason it is just the &quot;in&quot; thing to hate wraith...people call us names, say we suck, tell us how we cant do things, whatever...and i dont really understand why...anyone wanna explain?  We've killed just about everything in this game, as good or better than our opponents at one time or another, so why not say, &quot;hey wraith, good job!...this may open up a can-o-worms but, im honestly curious...<br>

Let's examine what you did last night in Ssra.<br>
<br>
Lotus Cult and Wraith are both trying to assemble sufficient force to do the Cursed cycle. To trigger the cycle, ten mobs must be killed within a certain time frame. Lotus Cult beats Wraith to getting more people there to do it. So does Wraith say &quot;Good job LC, next time we'll be ready for this and beat you to the punch&quot;?<br>
<br>
No. They take one of the ten mobs and pull him into an area teeming with blue-at-60 mobs, in essence holding the mob hostage. They do this AFTER we've started killing the ten mobs, ensuring that we need to wait two hours to re-start everything.<br>
<br>
In short, you griefed us.<br>
<br>
THAT is why we all hate you. Because of the childish moves you pull to try and get your way. Actually mobilize before LC, and start the cycle when you have enough? Not when you can grief and hope we get tired of your antics and go away!<br>

<br>
We were there first.  We had 18 in the mines and 2+ groups also in zone before you set one foot in.<br>
<br>
You ran us over... we were trying to talk to Binedina, and you started to try and trigger.<br>
<br>
We were there first, we both had plenty when we were trying to talk to Binedina.. and I'm gonna give Binedina the benefit of the doubt and not assume she was just snow jobbing us to keep us from starting first , but while we were trying to work it out peacefully you just started killing the triggers.  At that point we stooped down to fighting with you and I'm not real happy with our own part in that either.. but in the end we left it to you guys in hopes that Binedina was being honest that you guys might actually want to work something out.<br>
<br>
Wraith has never, EVER... seen you guys already gathering for something, then decided to rush in.  That is what you have done to us more than once.  See 30 wraith somewhere, you start running ppl in and tell us to go away.  <br>
<br>
We don't like playing that way.  We are happy to leave something alone if someone is already there.   <br>
<br>
If LC insists on fighting for spawns, we'll just have to adapt. <br>
<br>
We didn't want to fight.  <br>
<br>
LC chose to fight.  LC made the conscious decision both to rush in after we had already gotten a glyphed capable force, and then INSTEAD of talking just start ganking mobs and make it a straight up fight.  We were there, and we didn't rush to trigger even when we could have because we were talking.  LC got exactly the type of gaming experience they wanted last night.  You have no reason to be upset if you pick a fight and get a fight.  <br>
<br>
The encounter was no fun for us, and we took the high road and left rather than have a KS-fest on each mob.  I talked with Binedina during and after and we came to a reasonable understanding of each other's sides.   <br>

Its funny to hear such righteous arguments from the people that perpetrated the whole thing....We were in ssra yesterday from 2pm on...and had a glyph force show up at the same time you did....we tried to talk it out...you guys are the ones who decided to act like children and pick a fight...Well, you all got what ya wanted...but please dont make it sound like LC can do no wrong...lol <br>
<br>
ps: even if this misconstrued story is a reason to hate wraith, that happened last night 7-8-02, Wraith hating has been going on well before that, and no one ever gives a reason why...Even old friends tell me, why are you joining wraith..omg anyone but them...but honestly, i couldnt be happier and i have yet to hear a reason from them or anyone else why wraith is so bad....<br>

you just started killing the triggers... At that point we stooped down to fighting with you....<br>
<br>
This seems to indicate to me that we were pulling the triggers first and you purposefully held a trigger out of our reach so we couldn't spawn the basement.  We engaged the mob, we were on our way to spawning the mob and you interfered.  I personally could care less what kind of &quot;conversation&quot; was going on, you pulled a cheap ass move and since LC is honorable enough to not ks you we got to sit around on our asses for 2 hours waiting for respawns.  Grats Ragnarz for tanking a taskmaster for however long he did it.  It's ashame the Reviv members are such sheep (demonstrated by quite a few members' complete lack of knowledge as to what was going down last night).  <br>
<br>
Try and give as many excuses as you'd like for your blatant interference... we engaged, we started cycle, you intentionally prevented us from doing so by taking advantage of the fact we're an honorable guild who wouldn't ks the pull you had no intention of killing.  <br>
<br>
It really is funny that the only real guild anyone seems to have direct spawn problems with anymore is Wraith.  LC/VM seem to work things out and LC/RIP seem to work things out and I dont think VM/RIP have had too many issues but Wraith has problems because everyone else is so unreasonable... it couldn't possibly be them! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umocean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mocean</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/9/02 5:02:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: go go admission!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> there are always two sides to every story, Delores. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
