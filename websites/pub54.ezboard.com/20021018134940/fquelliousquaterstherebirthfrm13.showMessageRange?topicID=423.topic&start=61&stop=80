On another thread we're supposed to trust Monty not to abuse MB but according to this, he can't leave CT up long enough for you to buff.

Thanks for proving my point Biffins, you are contstantly losing your cool over the dumbest stuff. You're quick to blow your top but really slow to realize when not to fan the flames. I'm not saying Salta is right by starting the fire, but if you and others keep dumping gas on it you're just as guilty when it spreads.<br>

Strange, it looked like that's what Balily implied. But hey, when we're all prepped up for an important pull and a joker starts kiting the mob, I'm sure any misgivings are caused by people who overreact. Can't Wraith take a joke? You're such a swell guy for trying to lighten things up.<br>
<br>
&quot;But what have I done up to this point to abuse manaburn? Please, tell the audience.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nothing technically. When it comes to Tiqua's thread I maintain that /ooc'ing or /shout'ing your intentions to burn a dragon is not too much to ask, just like asking a raid to do the same thing is not too much to ask.<br>
<br>
&quot;Learn the facts first dumb ass, then come back.&quot;<br>

I learn them as people post them.

<br>
I flamed Moncleared for performing an extremely dishonorable act in which he purposefully killed a quest mob and then mocked my guild in ooc.  My flame was in direct response to that.  If you don't want me stirring stuff up on the flame boards then here's a hint... DONT GIVE ME ANYTHING TO START IT OVER SINCE THESE ARE IN FACT THE FLAME BOARDS.  Act honorably, play nice, and I won't have a thing to talk about.  Did Citto or Denia say anything about how lame of an act Moncleared performed?  No they said &quot;there goes Salta with his big mouth stirring stuff up&quot;.  Did Droz or Biffins say &quot;we're sorry Moncleared was such as ass&quot; nope they flamed me as well.  The only reason this issue is still ongoing is due directly to the lies they posted about things I haven't even said.  Do you expect me to sit by and let them say stuff about me that isn't true?  Oh let me just sit back and take the false accusations that they can't back up.  Hell Droz didn't even know I had talked to Gurunt (go go ignorance).  <br>
<br>
If you don't like to see stuff stirred up then wtf are you doing reading the flame boards for?  Every last one of you who complains about the stuff said on a flame board obviously needs to understand what a flame board is.  You don't complain when other people flame things but since it's against Wraith we have to say &quot;Salta's just stirring stuff up&quot;.  The answer is not banning me (hi i'm a mod for those who are able to read) the answer is to either stay away from this section of the boards or give me nothing to flame.<br>
<br>
Honestly if I did flame every single little thing Wraith did you'd have heard a lot more from me.  Have I mentioned the time you &quot;forgot&quot; that the next Creator pop was supposed to go to LC?  Nope, you haven't heard a thing about it.  Was I the one who started in with how lame it was to engage a mob and keep it alive so we couldn't start the Cursed cycle?  Nope that wasn't me either.  Did I ever mention the nice training that went on in NTOV /wave Marleena?  Nope wasn't me.  Basically what I'm saying is get a @#%$ clue Balily.  Your guildmate performed an utterly fucktarded action and I let the rest of the server who browses these boards know about it.  Get some honorable guildmates if you have problems with what I post or stfu and dont read here.<br>
<br>
If everyone in Wraith had the kind of class that Gurunt has this never would have become an issue, ever. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontaguethesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montague the Sorcerer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Social Butterfly </span><br>  Posts: 379<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/30/02 12:55:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=423.topic&index=70>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Esmalyn,<br>
Have you ever even killed CT?  Get a god damn clue already.  Balily, and correct me if im wrong hun, in no way implied that I KSed Cazic Thule from them.  Lol<br>
<br>
And about me /ooc'ing my &quot;intentions&quot;... well, sorry but it aint gonna fuckin happen.  We had 5 manaburn wizards in the zone, they had some sort of force going on somewhere else (take note, it wasnt at Sev pull spot) but it wasnt anywhere near big enough to kill sev.  Sorry, i never called my camps in seb unless somebody did a camp check - and i sure as hell wont do it with my mb pals.  And don't even try to start @#%$ about why didnt I do a camp check, because - again, like in seb - i'm not waiting on some gimp ass half made group at the zone in to get more groupies there to move to disco while my group is already ready to go.<br>
<br>
&quot;I learn them as people post them&quot; - quote<br>
<br>
Nobody said it was a KS, like i said above... nobody implied it was a KS either.  I'll ask again, have you ever even killed CT?  no no wait, have you ever even SEEN him?  sorry hun, one wizard cant solo him.<br>

You can still kill a mob with no prior knowledge but that which you gained yourself testing as long as it hasnt been spoiled yet.  UNfortunately right before you killed those the strats ofr all the Ssrae boss mobs (minus Emp) were spoiled on safehouse (which you admit getting info from) and deleted by the mods later that day since it was stolen from another guild and they wanted their strat info removed.  Kudos to the safehouse mods.  Now, im not saying you took the strat but its seems pretty coincidental doesnn't it?  /shrug.  But you still contradicted your own comment on your mainpage <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Either way its stil something to be proud of.  Having a strat and executing it are two different things.<br>

I have no idea what you were trying to do with CT in fear that day.  I know it wasnt ks because we all know ya cant solo him.  At the time i was pretty pissed, as were all of us.  Now i kinda think it was funny, just cause you died lol.  I guess if i was Salta, i would have booted up the other comp and written an essay about how much your a complete waste of space, and then tied it in to how your guild sucks too because of what you did, but, i guess we all dont have that much time or just general need to be noticed on our hands.<br>
<br>
Kailynn, many apologies for leaving the second 'N' off of your name.  I dont know why you insist on making this a flame between you and i, i have nothing against you, i dont even know you for that matter.  <br>

That was posted after our kills of the Ssra bosses and Shei.<br>
<br>
But ofcourse I'll admit. We DID have SOME prior info on all the encounters. The rest we learnt during the fight. If I exaggerated on the news page and said &quot;little to no prior info&quot; when I should have technically said &quot;little prior info&quot;, well that's just that... exaggeration. All of VM / LC etc too tend to slightly exaggerate their own achievements on the sites. In my opinion it's all good if your guildmates look at the site the next day and get a feeling of accomplishment.<br>
<br>
Right now we probably have a lot more reliable information at hand about the Emperor encounter than either VM or LC did on their first attempts 2 months ago. I am fully aware that doing a mob in 10 tries is a greater accomplishment then doing it 2 months later on the first try. I doubt we'll take as many tries as either VM or LC do when we start working on him end of next month some time, but I do know that in the annals of history that means little. If we're able to kill the mobs faster it allows us to catch up faster, but we do know that we're still trying to catch up.<br>
<br>
It'll be more interesting in Planes of Power. We wait with abated breath.<br>
<br>
Heheh and thanks for the kind words. We are indeed very proud of what we've accomplished.<br>

<br>
If you got such a big problem with Salta flaming why don't you give it a rest too?  You can't go one post without tossing something out there and you KNOW he's gonna respond.<br>
Before telling somebody else to grow up etc etc look at yourself.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I guess if i was Salta, i would have booted up the other comp and written an essay about how much your a complete waste of space, and then tied it in to how your guild sucks too because of what you did, but, i guess we all dont have that much time or just general need to be noticed on our hands.&quot;<br>
<br>
Salta sits at the docks with a fishing pole just waiting to see what he can reel in next.  <br>
<br>
Why do you keep falling for the same bait?<br>
