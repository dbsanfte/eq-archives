<br>
Monty, I ask again...<br>
<br>
After someone beat you to the camp, why did you stay IN the camp, and IN their way?<br>
<br>
Bottom line was that you were unable to get your full group to a camp spot before the other team.  The other team was there, and pulling before you got there.<br>
<br>
I find it convenient that when you get beat by the &quot;First Come&quot; rules that you and yours have always fought for, that all of a sudden you 180 your story and go Rodney King with the &quot;Cant we all just get along&quot;.<br>
<br>
And please... cause I'm obviously spacing here... enlighten us as to why you setup camp in the middle of the other camp?  Personally I dont care if Montyy's team asked you nicely, rudely, or whatever, to move elsewhere... my question is why did they have to do so at all?  You KNOW better.  You were beaten to that camp... yet you stood there and drove them outta your camp.<br>
<br>
And to think I considered you a man of honor.  I guess when the phat lewt is to be had, yer as bad a whore as the rest.<br>
<br>
It's a shame. <p><center>

Were you even there with the group? I think not... your taking it more serious than most of their group and you weren't even there. To answer your question that still remains as you say, 2 of our members were there, charmi was sitting there alone and cleric was at zone with no invis. Montague was porting us in, dont even say you have never been in this situation. When 2 members are at the spot and the porter has to port people to the spot. So we didnt really run them over, but in a way we did but we also had people there. But anyways, its the past, we cant do nothing about it now, all we can do is say sorry and thats the most. It would be best if we just drop it, but then people have to keep replying and making it worst and trying to lite the fire even higher. Thats all i got to say really, peace.<br>

<br>
You had a chanter at the camp, and a cleric at the zone.  This means what?  You did not have the forces to engage and hold a hotly desired camp, and you lost it to a quicker force... and then you behaved in a disgraceful manner, drove out the other team, and have the nerve to post here and make it seem like Montyy was a jackass for not &quot;politely&quot; asking you to leave.<br>
<br>
And as to why I am harping on it... why not?  Oh... cause maybe I should just keep quiet, cause it wasnt a big deal?  Maybe not to you.  But then again... yer the folks that rolled over another team to get yer lewt... so obviously it's nothing much to you.  Just another day in the life.<br>
<br>
You're a collective group of gimp hypocrits.  Period.  Ya make me sick.  You say to get over it, and to let it drop... but did YOU let it drop... when you got beat to that camp?  Nope.  You didnt let it drop.  You made their camp hell, you got them killed by being in their way, and you drove them off.<br>
<br>
You need to take a nice tall glass of reality now, and chase it with a glass of STFU.<br>

You act like this is the first ever stunt pulled ever on the server, it happens MANY MANY times, happens to me all the God damn time. Raiding or Xping. If I were seriously in their shoes, Hell i would be freakin pissed off the hook, but I wouldn't post it on a board (not trying to flame anything here, i know u people gonna try to quote me or somethin) but it DOES happen and you HAVE to get over it. Put them on ignore or jus never help them again if your really that pissed. But what i'm trying to say is, ONE stunt doesn't make the person you are and if you hate me or one of the others posting against you, so be it, I dont even have no clue who the hell you are. I know your gonna reply to this, no doubt, I am trying to stay away from the boards but your making it more worse. Peace for now~<br>

Okay! Like I previously said, I think Charmi would live as long as a pull would not see adds. It's not enough to hold the camp. You can't claim it, however many other developments (Monty &amp; posse on the way, cleric stuck, whatever).<br>
<br>
&quot;Montague was porting us in, dont even say you have never been in this situation.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've been in this situation. Ya know what? It sucks, 'cause I lost the race and did not presume the other party would be okay with an insistance to stay on my part. I wonder if Montyy's group wouldn't have hung up on it if Monty asked if it was okay to share when they got there. Did you Monty?<br>

<br>
Using, FCFS on something like AoW, Worm, THO, AL, HP, hell Vox, Naggy... is completely different from using FCFS on something like NG, North Wing (in HS), discos, PLANKS, etc... You can't share a single mob like I think your referring to - planks however is a large camp and can easily be shared, I'm not sorry in the least that my group found it easy to fight in the small area while Montyy's group didn't... if they found it difficult to function then they were more than welcome to leave, otherwise we were more than happy to accomdate them in the hall where we were.<br>
<br>
As for us &quot;setting up camp&quot; right on top of them... well, its simply not true.  We were fighting at the end of hte hallway, they were fighting at the front... we were pulling mobs fine to our spot, and so were they up until the point montyy continually tries to run into me and Sparkles - much to his disappointment - whereas shortly after (VERY shortly after, like withing 15 seconds) his cleric dies to 3 goos... I doubt he could out-taunt complete heal in that amount of time anyway, i've played a war before.<br>
<br>

It wasnt totally our fault that we got their cleric killed. If you have ever fought in CT, taunt is horrible. If you CH once while the tank has no aggro, cleric = dead if they don't use any source of Divine aura or Divine barrier. You cannot taunt it off a cleric once they have aggro unless you memblur/divine or even root or whatever. You weren't even there, you DIDN'T see what happened, you are jus hearing things and rephrasing it. Peace~<br>

<br>
Mont says were were 'sharing' the camp, you had the front and we had the back....well we're talking about a space that I can fill 50% of when I'm not shrunk, how can 2 groups share that, and you being on a horse to boot....yeah LOTS of room to work there.  <br>
<br>
And cleric died for 3 reasons 1: I couldnt get to the pool in time to taunt it off.  2: Chanter couldnt target to mez the extra ooze that I brought in with me cuz it was so damn crowed. 3: she got aggro on the 2 goos I pulled, plus the one you already had in camp. which shouldnt have been there in the first place, but you all were being asses and pulling on top of us.<br>
<br>
You two make me sad. really you do, you symbolize all that is fekked up in EQ.  This all boils down to respect, of which niether of you obvioulsy have for anyone but yourselves.  If you had any, you would have respected that we did indeed beat you to the camp and left, as we would have done had you gotten there before us (and no just the chanter there don't count) <br>
<br>
And Tald, why did I bring this to the boards? cuz you both pissed me off to no end and I needed to vent...had I been a ass like you I would just pulled the whole damn goo camp ontop of you and called it even, but instead I left and channeled my anger in a more constructive way.<br>

I left to go port Tald in and you took it from us - I understand that what you did wasn't against the rules, however it was still a rude thing to do.  Because of this, we also - breaking no rules - became rude (on purpose) and made you share with us... Don't make it sound like we're the only ones here who were inconsiderate, if you didn't want any trouble you should of just respected the fact that we were at/claiming the camp... we didn't ask you to leave your own old exp camp.<br>
<br>
And also, tald kept agro on the goo we pulled the entire time, go look at your logs or have the cleric look at her logs if you think she died to our goo, because she didnt.  I'm almost positive you are not aware that the spot you had just pulled from was a 3 spawn, not a 2 spawn... if your cleric died to 3 goos then its because you pulled the third one, not because tald lost agro... if that was the case then our own cleric would of been dead long before yours, given the fact that tald had already been CH'ed once or twice before.<br>
<br>
<br>
You earn my respect, i don't just give it - and you didn't get any by running over us to the camp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uquasquetonfyrestrike.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quasqueton Fyrestrike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Road Kill Cabbie</span><br>  Posts: 348<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/12/02 1:45:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=387.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Inconsiderate people suck...</span><hr size=1> Ummm... first off... saying that it happens all the time doesnt make it right for you to do it as well.  If anything, it makes you even worse for KNOWING what you were doing, and doing it anyway.<br>
<br>
As far as CT experience and Taunt.  Ive fought in CT both before and after they fixed that Taunt problems.  As Montyy said, he wasnt able to Taunt because he could get past all the people in his way.<br>
<br>
Monty says that you were in a diff area, while Montyy says you were right on top of them.  Someone has their story wrong.<br>
<br>
Picking the person to believe is easy for me.  <br>
<br>
1. Montyy is my RL brother, and he has nothing to gain by lieing to me.  I also know that he's one of the most honorable people on this server (even with his temper)  snicker<br>
<br>
2. Tally has all but admitted that they did what they did with intent and malice.<br>
<br>
As far as letting this drop, or chilling, I ask you this... why?  Why should I?  Maybe YOU condone camp stealing, etc... but I dont.  You have no honor, and I have lotsa time here at the office to sit back and make sure as many people as I can know what kind of people you are.<br>
<br>
As for Monty's silly sex comments, well... not sure what to tell ya bro... but while creating a female woodelf and spanking off to her from the title screen might be your idea of the ideal friday night date... it just doesnt do it for me.<br>
<br>
Sowry.  Now go clean your keyboard... cause that's nasty.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
***EDIT***<br>
<br>
&quot;You earn my respect, i don't just give it - and you didn't get any by running over us to the camp&quot;<br>
<br>
Do we earn it by overrunning the camp?  That seems to be how Explicit is trying to get respect. <p><center>

I don't really wanna bring your guild into this, but I will use it as an example. The week you guys camped planks for a straight week, you guys did not have a capable force 24/7. I could have just brought my group and have done the same thing, but I didn't because they claimed it. Yes it might have been wrong what we did, but this is the same situation.<br>
<br>
Montyy - You could have vented in another way, but you posted on the boards which caused so much drama which is bullshit over a stunt that happened once. We both had our rights, maybe not verant's way, but we both did and people agree both ways. I'm not saying you guys are the bad guys, nor us, its something that happened and needs to be forgotten. Yes, I know you guys are gonna say that &quot;you are jus saying this because it didn't happen to you&quot; or bullshit like that. But what can we do now? We said sorry, we both had our chances at the spot. This is causing more drama than ever and it isn't fun. If you havn't noticed, I have never been in a flame post, and all my 6 posts on this board is on this thread. Thing that gets to me is, you are trying to make us look like super bad guys when we aren't. Everyone does this at some point, whether it's to get that item done with or whatever reason. I don't want to post again, but I am pretty sure someone else is gonna post even more questions and stuff.<br>

<br>
What were your rights please?  The people who had the camp left.  You were moving in and had one person at the camp.  This is not enough to claim said camp, and you know it.  Monty being off to port people means nothing... cause the fact remains that he WASNT at the camp.  <br>
<br>
Sorry... <br>
<br>
Montyy's team heads in and all members are accounted for, and in camp.  Camp goes to Montyy.<br>
<br>
Again... where are your &quot;rights&quot; in this issue?<br>
<br>
Sure we can argue whether or not Montyy's team should have given you time to gather forces.  They chose not to.  This was well within their rights, as they had been in CT a while, saw the spot open, and decided to upgrade their camp spot.  It didnt give you the right to do what you did.<br>
<br>
Period.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day. <p><center>
