I have never in my long standing EverQuest career trained (intentionally or otherwise) anyone. Thats ANYONE. And I stand by my claim, dating back since beta. This is a GAME...I can take a death for a few pixels if it means 10 other people can enjoy the next 20-30 minutes of playtime. You don't know me, and from the looks of your cocksmart elitism, you never will. Regarding the Hate incident, I have NEVER seen such blatant stupidity on your part. We came into safe area along the outsides, and I *PERSONALLY* heard a loathing lich casting stuns, and it was definitely not on me, or anyone around me, because I didnt see any spell effects. I have run circles around Hate on the side wall hundreds of times, pulling corpses from under Inny's nose while dank ass pissheads like you waited at safe camp (or your bind point) for me to bring home the bacon. I believe its safe to say (hard as it is to believe, on your part) that I've zoned into Hate more times than your whole guild has been to their bind points. No offense on your guildies that aren't missing that special chromosome, but if I see all your clerics sitting down to camp and 2 UP members running in from the buildings, I KNOW something is up. <br>
<br>
Granted, we're not the &quot;uber&quot; guild of the server, but that was a damn mighty fine train you guys brought in. And, after most of yours were dead, which, would most possibly mean these things were all aggroed on *blink blink* you guys (for some insane reason, your squad pulled them perhaps?) We took them all. This was no mere train, people at home and reading this board, this was a &quot;Holy Hell&quot; train. There were at LEAST 15 or so mobs, including most all the revs, cleric house, and roamers. This stands to reason someone WANTED all this in camp, for some bizarre reason. But we took em, took em all, and then took more from the screwed ass aggro your dead and camped had left in the buildings. We ended up clearing *most* of the first floor in a total of what, 10 minutes? Tell me then, why the hell would we need to train your gimp butts to get to where we needed?<br>
<br>
What I find even more amusing, to add to the story, is later, on the second floor, which we had promptly moved to and were killing along happily...all of a sudden, here come 15 or so big ass DE NPC's. Yes, we fought the good fight, offed as many as we could, and died, then started the CR process. That's not the strange part. The strange part is the lil' guy standing in a doorway behind us as we're doing all we can to salvage the situation, with a nice little UP tag below his name. Thats all I could see in the short amount of time before I fell. I know it wasnt one of ours, as (for those of you that can read) &quot;Unruled Power&quot; is a quite bit longer than &quot;Radiant&quot;...so, as it stands, I'm thinking it was another of YOUR squad, doing stupid shit. I'll come to where I was resurrected, and while watching people loot their corpses, turned and saw quite a few UP members standing in the doorway, doing nice little childish emotes of giggling and laughing. Yeah UP, I bet you had nothing to do with that, either. <br>
<br>
On a further note, do any of the older players remember way back when the term &quot;cheese breaking&quot; was formed for the planes, where a guild would wait for another guild to clear a bunch of crap, leave, then the waiting guild would run in and secure a camp, having to break nothing? I do. That said, it's really not such a big deal anymore granting the difficulty of the game and the time involved with some areas. But, doing it in Hate just to spite another guild *while* they're in there, is just retarded, plain and simple. We were working towards and I believe IN VIEW of the last mini-boss we wanted to work that night, and all of a sudden, hes gone. Nice cheese break, UP...of course, it wasnt pulled yet, so its not against the rules, but just showing how utterly lame and pathetic you guys truly are. <br>
<br>
Screw Cazel. I don't care about that situation, yeah, I'm part of Radiant, and you guys are part of UP, but watch your pathetic little mouth when you bring me into a situation kiddo, it'll only get you hurt in the end. As the lurkers and old timers here know, I simply don't and won't put up with that kind of crap from a nothing little pissant, especially from the likes of you. Furthermore, you think everyone here and 99% of the Quellious population likes and gets a kick out of Radiant because we train/KS people? Get a clue, man. <br>
<br>
Finally, as you may not know (showing even further the depths of your depravity and utter stupidity) Tristadorn and Maeve live together...hello! Of course he saw it all...are ye daft? Not to mention our guild actually has...*shock* communication! It's a wonderful thing, you guys should try it sometime, seeing as you obviously don't have it now, with your little &quot;Kiting Cazel for a good while&quot; incident. What the hell could be so hard with getting a druid there, having the druid add some damage, then having a melee run behind him and whup on him a while? If you had any clue on game tactics, you'd know this is EASILY done, and requires a couple of people, and is VERY effective. <br>
<br>
Well, I saw something else you've very moronically added. You hope to see Trist at another Ragefire kill rolling on loot. Well, dinky dau, You're obviously too closed minded and simple to see that Radiant doesn't roll on loot. We give our loot based on attitude, respect, and need, and we pass down or guildbank what we aren't using. What the hell does Trist need personally from Ragefire anyway? If it was an open raid I'm willing to bet he was there for SOMEONE ELSE's needs or wants, and using HIS time for SOMEONE ELSE. Which is just about all Trist does these days. Don't ever slander my guild leader and friend, you'll never grow high enough to even touch that man's boots. before I just read that, I was here only to defend myself from your idiocy. You entered a vein where the blood courses fiery and deep red, and now you're going to ride the wave. Get ready kiddo, the fun is just beginning.<br>
<br>
I've seen plenty of tits in my life, but never any tits quite as stupid as you guys. <p><img src=http://www.webspawner.com/users/zodiack/zodiack.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font> <br> <br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
