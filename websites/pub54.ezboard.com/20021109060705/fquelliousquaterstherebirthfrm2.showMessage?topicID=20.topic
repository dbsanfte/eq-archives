<br>
As Millikin was demonstrating a technique for hunting in a tundra environment to another Northman shaman she met recently named Tindaila, an abrupt mental mandate distracted her attention and the snow leopard she had been stalking, moved out of sight.<br>
 &quot;That medallion you have.  I'll take it off your hands.&quot;  The demanding tone was unmistakably Valdayana D`Varr's.  <br>
 &quot;What medallion?&quot;  Millikin's expression was blank.  She specifically remembered that she had at least three medallions in her possession and the arrogant enchanter's presumptuous manner immediately annoyed the ranger.  A sudden warcry from one of Tindaila's companions as he drove his spear into a mammoth diverted Millikin's attention to the hunt.  She watched the group, occasionally reciting a cantra to heal them if they were seriously injured but after a few moments the mammoth collapsed into the snow, dead -- killed when Tindaila delivered a crushing blow right between the mammoth's eyes.  The snowy ground reverberated from the beast's sudden impact.<br>
 &quot;The one Dermonar let you have from that skeleton that roams near Fironia Vie.&quot;  Unless Millikin's perceptions were off, she thought she detected a hint of annoyance at having to elaborate on something that should be elementary to the ranger.  'Let me have?...'  All of a sudden her attention was undivided from Valdayana's words.  Time to clarify something.  <br>
 &quot;One, I helped kill that skeleton.  Dermonar didn't give it to me.  Two, how do you know about it?&quot;<br>
The two of them had obtained the medal for Exilia and Millikin volunteered to deliver it, only to find out Exilia didn't need it any longer.  The ranger had all but forgotten about it and didn't attribute any significance to the tarnished piece of metal.<br>
 &quot;You told me you had it.&quot;  Was the careful response.  Immediately Millikin's eyes narrowed in suspicion.<br>
 &quot;No.  I know you didn't find out from me as I am very certain I didn't tell anyone I had it.&quot;  <br>
 &quot;Then Dermonar did.&quot;  Valdayana stated dismissively.  &quot;You can meet up with me and hand it over this evening.&quot;  <br>
Millikin's mood was rapidly deteriorating.  Her response to the enchanter was less than cordial and laced with sarcasm. <br>
 &quot;Thank you so much for planning my evening for me, without even consulting me, first, dear.&quot;  <br>
 &quot;You're quite welcome.&quot;  Valdayana was either oblivious to or chose to ignore the ranger's flippancy.  'Probably the latter.'  Millikin thought which irritated her even more.  <br>
 &quot;I'm in the middle of Hell Frozen Over right now, so meeting tonight is unlikely.  I also don't have the medallion piece on me.  It's hidden in a cache somewhere.&quot;<br>
 &quot;Then fetch it.&quot;  That was the final response from the enchanter before the mental communique ended.<br>
<br>
 'Just who in the Nine Hells does she think she is?'  As the ranger's temper was about to boil over, another thought occurred to her.  'What is so special about that medallion piece?'  In spite of the fact that Valdayana's patronizing manner had the extreme effect of either amusing or (as in this instance) irritating the ranger,  (After all, you can only excuse venerable age so much from someone who often talks down to you before your own patience runs out.  And while patience was generally considered a mandatory trait of a long lived race, compared to most older elves of all subraces, dwarves, and halflings, Millikin had yet to refine it.) Millikin would have cheerfully handed over the medallion to Valdayana without another question except one thing...<br>
<br>
She lied about how she knew the ranger had it. (Millikin figured that the enchanter really used some form of divination magic to ascertain who had the medallion piece.  Not unbelievable in her mind since the Valdayana eerily knew things about her that no one else did and seemed to delight in unnerving the younger ranger with that fact on occasion.)  An obvious conclusion was that she didn't want her to know it's real value.  And the manner by which the luhtmauyar asked, indicated she wanted the ranger to think she was doing her a favor.  In all, Valdayana's high handed command, which was her usual effective tactic of browbeating compliance from others, only served to trigger a streak of contrariness in Millikin.  <br>
<br>
Later that evening, she fished the medal out of a box she had hidden away and studied it closely.  The markings thereon meant nothing to her so she decided to show it to someone she could trust who might be able to provide her with more information about the medal.<br>

<br>
  Travel did not bear the same time consuming meaning with the Minstrel as it did most.  Her abilities under the compositions of the bard Selo graced her with movement that merely left a trail of stunned onlookers in her wake.  And so upon the simple summons of the ranger, Autumn designated their place of meeting to be Qeynos.  Upon her arrival in the plains of Karana she withdrew her small travel drums of stretched walrus skin and wood from her packs and cradled it snugly under one arm.  A baleful glance was cast upward as the clouds threatened rain and she determined Karana needed a new hobby since she felt like a mushroom each time she traveled through his domain.  She picked up the beat on her drums and swiftly the music wrapped around her, covering her in a mist and raising her feet from the ground.  With the echo of bongos in her wake she took off with a speed unknown to most.<br>
<br>
 Her arrival in the city was swift, and the welcome of the guards of Antonious Bayle were warm as always.  Her eye did not miss the occasional glower however and she met their gaze with equal resolve, and placed a threatening hand upon the hilt of crystalline blade at her hip.  It was enough to make the guard keep walking.  The politics, intrigue and very corrupt nature of half of the city was nearly as bad as Freeport at times.  As Autumn had dabbled in the Freeport quagmire, she also had here, always with some measure of cost.<br>
<br>
 Weaving through the narrow paths and allies a hand reached up to pluck one of the pink flora that grew upon the wall ivy and she tucked it neatly behind one ear as she set foot in the South district of the city.  She spotted Millikin at once, sitting across from the clock at the well in the heart of town.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Millikin!  What is this you have me running half way across the world to discuss?&quot;  The bard quipped with a smile, as both she and Millikin knew that the run Autumn boasted of was hardly that.<br>
<br>
 She took a seat beside the ranger at the well, stretching her legs a moment to recover from her run.  Her face betrayed her curiosity as she watched Millikin withdraw a small wrapped item from her pack and then slipped it in the hands of the bard.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I had hoped you could divine something of the meaning behind this.&quot;  The ranger shrugged before recounting a brief history.  &quot;Dermonar and I battled the skeleton that roams near Firiona Vie.  I discovered this on its remains before we continued on our way.&quot;<br>
<br>
 Pushing aside the cloth that protected it, Autumn studied the piece a moment.  It was indeed from the lands of Kunark, and while the bard could not decipher the writings, they were also not unfamiliar to her from the time she spent questing the coins for the tambourine of Nostrolo.  She admittedly could not read all of those coins without the aid of song either.  Exhaling softly she then drew in a long breath from parted lips before an almost eerie melody pervaded her lips.  From the music a soft golden glow sparkled around the bards eyes momentarily and as she surveyed the piece the golden shimmer seemed to move across it in a flash.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Hmm.&quot;  Autumn squinted at the piece a moment more before looking up at Millikin.  &quot;A unique piece here Mill.  I sense many hands upon it.  The writing is old, one of the original Iksar tribes.  It bears some holy significance to them.  Since they are of a primitive culture I would assume it derives from a shamanic nature.  I also sense the wrath of Sathir upon it as well as the seeking eye of an emperor long lost.&quot;  She paused letting her words sink in a moment before tacking on a touch more information.  &quot;I would seek the spirit of Emperor Ganak... he is still within this world... and I gather he is really looking for this.&quot;  <br>
<br>
 As soon as the words were done the luster of the song was gone, the window of information abruptly shut before the bards eyes.  Shaking off the effects of the song she wrapped the piece once more and pressed it into the hands of the ranger.  &quot;Seek Ganek my friend, as I doubt Sathir would grant you an audience.  He is too busy toying around in that undead infested worm hole of a castle that smells like wet dog.&quot;  She grinned at her last comment which also brought forth a smile from her companion.  <br>

<br>
Skyshrine.<br>
<br>
     The dark furred timber wolf padded beyond the golem sentries and guardian drakes found on the first floor of the fortress that served as home to the friends of the Dragonkin and the lair of Lord Yelinak, leader of the Claws of Veeshan.  Unretractable claws clicked in a rhythmic pace as the wolf wandered the labyrinth passages and up the large winding marble stairs and across the stone floors.  Occasionally the wolf would blink out of sight whenever she stepped on a marked panel designed to translocate a traveler to another section of Skyshrine.  Finally the wolf arrived at her intended location within Skyshrine.  She reached up to push open the door with both forepaws enabling her to slip through the door in a blur of motion before it closed behind her.  The wolf deliberately sniffed the air and nodded slightly.  'She was here.'  She then stalked silently across the carpeted floor towards the one she sought.<br>
<br>
     The Teir`Dal enchanter was sitting at a table, engrossed in reading a book of some sort and didn't seem to indicate she noticed the door of the library open.  Grinning wolfishly, she dropped down low to the floor and silently crept over to the table. The enchanter gave no indication of awareness to anything beyond the contents of the book before her; despite the fact a wolf was stalking her.  Suddenly the wolf sprang upwards putting both forepaws on the table beside the Teir`Dal.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Hi.&quot;  The wolf did not actually speak verbally but employed a form of spirit speech, audible only to those for whom it addressed or whom the speaker willed in proximity to hear.  The Teir`Dal never looked up from her book.  She knew perfectly well who it was (And it was no one who warranted her undivided attention at this time.) and her only response to the greeting was an expert poke in the wolf's ribs.<br>
  &quot;Oww.&quot;  The wolf, or Millikin Erreene as friends and associates knew her, recoiled from the jab and dropped to the floor.  That one hurt more than normal and she glowered up at the enchanter when an idea seized her.  She had watched the spellcaster often enough in the Halls of Testing to know where she kept the material components for her favored protective spell and before the enchanter could react, the timber wolf had snagged the pouch holding several tiny periodots and gulped it down.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You will make yourself ill eating so many of those.&quot;  The warning was not spoken out of actual concern for the ranger's physical health.  Personally Valdayana D`Varr wouldn't have cared one iota if the ranger died in some alleyway somewhere vomiting up all of her internal organs in the street, but periodots were a rather costly gem to purchase from jewelers.<br>
  &quot;It's worth it.  Since you won't be able to recast your rune spell.&quot;  Millikin replied triumphantly.  Valdayana looked up from her book to watch in mild amusement as the wolf finished swallowing her component pouch.  She still had several periodots kept in her pants pocket in case she needed them, in the off chance a skilled pickpocket (Or aggrieved ranger in this case.) managed to pilfer her regular supply.  There was no need to tell her that though.  Especially since the foolish girl may take a notion in her head to try and eat those next.  And entertaining as the idea was, she did not feel inclined to wasting her magical energies on the ranger this day to teach her proper respect for her power.  Particularly while she still had plenty of other equally amusing ways to torment the ranger.<br>
<br>
     She looked back down at her book and poked the lupine ranger in the side once more, knowing perfectly well it would annoy her.  Sure enough, the wolf started gnawing on her hand in an effort to bite her finger off.  The attempts at actually sinking her teeth into flesh were frustrated by the protective barrier designed to block physical and many forms of magical damage to the enchanter.  Valdayana rested her chin on her free hand and watched dispassionately.  Most times, it only took a few bites until Millikin would desist, realizing the rune spell was not going dissipate anytime soon.  Other times, like this one, when the wood elf's mood was more... feral, she would continually try to wear down the rune shield in hopes of breaking through.  Until Valdayana shoved her finger further down the wolf's throat to trigger an involuntary gag reflex so she could disengage her hand during the inevitable choking fit.  <br>
<br>
<br>
     For her own part, Millikin shook her head as her eyes watered from the gag spasm, and mentally counted to ten.  She was forgetting the reason she was here.  The first thing she saw as her vision cleared was Valdayana's smug expression and it gave Millikin pause.  Maybe she should trust her instincts and refuse.  But the ranger's own personal code of honor dictated that she repay a favor if she could, even though it came to her as a demand.  That same sense of obligation did not extend however to allowing someone with evil intentions to further foul agendas.  She was willing to give Valdayana D`Varr the benefit of the doubt.<br>
<br>
  &quot;What are you looking for in Veeshan's Peak?&quot;  Millikin stared over at the enchanter and waited for an answer.<br>
So, she figured out what the medallion was for, did she?  No matter.  She probably doesn't know much else.<br>
  &quot;I like dragons.  And they like me too.  Surely you know that?&quot;  The enchanter replied with artificial seriousness as she closed the book before her on the table and stood up.  It was a deliberate maneuver to make the wolfish ranger dispel her wolf form or look up at her.<br>
  &quot;The Ring of Scale has differing views than the Claws of Veeshan.&quot;  Millikin was not ignorant of the split between the dragons that led to the formation of the Ring of Scale.  Nor was she going to follow Valdayana's lead in the mental dance.  She climbed into another chair nearby and sat down.<br>
  &quot;The Ring of Scale likes me also.  I wish to learn from them.&quot;  Valdayana stated.<br>
  &quot;And how did you manage that?  By slaying your own kind or bards?&quot;  Millikin scoffed.<br>
  &quot;If you must know, I spent time lurking in Mistmoore, helping to thwart Mayong's plans to become immortal.  And steal his knowledge.&quot;  The enchanter volunteered with skillfully staged reluctance.  It was no secret to her that Millikin harbored a hatred of the vampire lord and his minions, mostly Teir`Dal, that claimed dominion of a sizeable realm near her homeland and decided to play on that.<br>
<br>
      Instantly Millikin's thoughts shifted to the Avenging Caitiff she had met in Mistmoore.  A caitiff was an individual who pursued the path of vampiric immortality but were eventually cast out by the vampire master as unacceptable, usually before being turned but after acquiring a measure of unholy power.  Why they were not destroyed vary in reason from each individual.  Some escaped final death, others who had simply fallen out of favor with their master and must regain it.  Others became a caitiff because they (Like the one she had met.) seek vengeance on a vampire.  <br>
  &quot;I see.&quot;  Millikin's eyes narrowed darkly.  Was Valdayana a caitiff?  She sniffed cautiously, knowing those marked as Mayong's Agents by scent or glyph if she looked for it.  An aura of poisonous death clung to them that could not be casually concealed even if they abandoned him.<br>
  &quot;What?&quot;  Valdayana looked at her with practiced innocence.<br>
  &quot;Do you seek immortality?  Or a way to extend your lifespan beyond what is natural?&quot;  Millikin replied to the question with another question of her own.<br>
  &quot;Not anymore.&quot;  Valdayana replied slyly.<br>
  &quot;Then what are you looking for among the dragonkin?&quot;  <br>
  &quot;I can't tell you everything.&quot;  She poked the ranger once more.<br>
  &quot;If you want something from me, I want to know why and what for.  I can't simply hand it over if it's going to be used for some nefarious purpose.&quot;  Millikin stared at her once again.<br>
  &quot;Such is your choice.  It's probably wise considering my history.&quot;  Valdayana stated dismissively.  &quot;But I told you I wish to learn more from the dragons.&quot;<br>
  &quot;If not immortality, then what object or device of power are you seeking?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Knowledge.  I understand you cannot comprehend that though.&quot;  Valdayana crossed her arms in front of her and took her usual tone of condescension with the ranger.<br>
  &quot;You do not seek knowledge for its own sake.  Even I am not that naïve as to believe such of you.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;If you've already come to your own conclusions then why do you have to question me?  You obviously know it all, right?&quot;  <br>
  &quot;I'm not arrogant enough to claim to know everything.  That's your venue.  What makes you think I've come to any conclusion?&quot;  Instantly Millikin became defensive.<br>
  &quot;You are dismissing what I say as I say it.&quot;  Valdayana poked Millikin once again before sitting in her chair once again.                <br>
  &quot;You are dancing around the question.&quot;  She snapped at Valdayana's hand, deliberately missing it.<br>
  &quot;Am not.&quot;  The enchanter reopened her book.  Her response was in lilting singsong mockery to Millikin's statement.      <br>
  &quot;Stop playing games with me.&quot;  Millikin snarled angrily.  Valdayana looked up from her book and fixed a contemplatively appraising look at the wolf sitting across from her.  <br>
  &quot;No.&quot;  She stated flatly and resumed reading her book.<br>
<br>
     Millikin stared in disbelief.  How had the conversation turned around like this?  She dropped down from her chair and moved closer to the enchanter.  What was that book?  Maybe it would be more informative as to the luhtmauyar's intentions.  In the blink of an eye, she transformed back into a wood elf.  Valdayana ignored her and Millikin looked down at the pages.  She couldn't quite make out the words as the letters kept crawling around the pages like bugs.  As she tried to follow their movements, she suddenly staggered back stunned momentarily.  Valdayana smiled to herself as the warding seal placed on the book to prevent unauthorized perusal of its contents took effect. <br>
  &quot;What specific knowledge are you looking for then?&quot;  Millikin persisted in her questioning.<br>
  &quot;I hear they make a mean Mountain Giant stew.&quot;  Valdayana quipped, turning the page of her book once more.<br>
  &quot;Maybe I should rephrase.  By what reason should I hand over the medallion piece to you?&quot;  Millikin sighed.  <br>
Valdayana had to give her credit for determination in trying to ascertain her business in Veeshan's Peak.<br>
  &quot;You should let me have it because it's the right thing to do, of course.&quot;  Valdayana poked her in the arm.  &quot;Because I've done so much for you.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Like what?&quot;  Millikin looked at her skeptically.  The ranger was most curious to hear Valdayana's observations on such matters.<br>
  &quot;I've made you an accepted and tolerated member of the community.  You were an outcast dark ranger before, but I brought you back.&quot;  Valdayana stated sagely.<br>
     Millikin blinked several times then laughed openly at such a ridiculous statement.<br>
  &quot;Accepted by whom?  And more important what community?  That's not necessarily a good thing.  And since when was I ever considered important, particularly to you?&quot; <br>
  &quot;Oh you're not, I'm just trying to make you feel better.&quot;  Valdayana replied.<br>
  &quot;I feel fine.  You are the one obviously in a delusional state.  Look, Valdayana  I&quot;  Millikin was about to explain exactly why she had misgivings about handing of the medallion piece to her.  No response was forthcoming and the ranger paused and looked at the dark elf spellcaster still reading.  Why should she waste her time explaining the concepts of her own personal honor to someone who would doubtless make a mockery of them as surely as she had done so to her just now?  Millikin's eyes narrowed in resolve at her decision. <br>
<br>
     Millikin Erreene would not willingly give Valdayana D`Varr her medallion piece without being convinced it would not be used for a sinister objective.  The ranger abruptly turned on her heel and departed the Skyshrine librarium without another word.<br>
<br>
<br>
Disclaimers:<br>
 - White Wolf's Vampire the Masquerade defines a caitiff as a clanless vampire who was sired by another outcast vampire or their generational bloodline has thinned to the point where they don't possess all the standard powers (called Disciplines) of their sire's clan.  This matches, to an extent, with the European vampiric lore that defines a caitiff as I have used in the confines of this post.  <br>
They should not to be confused with a vampeal, the offspring of a mortal and a vampire who also possess some of the powers of a vampire. (D from Vampire Hunter D and Blade from Marvel comics fit this definition.)  Vampeals are born with their powers, caitiff develop them over time.<br>

<p align=right>When I set out to lead humanity along my Golden Path I promised a lesson<br>
their bones would remember. I know a profound pattern humans deny with<br>
words even while their actions affirm it. They say they seek security and<br>
quiet, conditions they call peace. Even as they speak, they create seeds of<br>
turmoil around them.<br>
--The God Emperor from <i>Chapterhouse Dune</i></p><br>
<br>
“Do you know what you’re doing?”<br>
<br>
Esmalyn secured a runaway lock with her upswept ear. <i>If she asks one more time...</i><br>
<br>
Niedre stood in the hallway, arms crossed under her chest. She was surprised to learn this assignment required the skills of a <i>shebale.</i> In a flash of hand signals Esmalyn insisted she check the wing upon entry. There was no time to argue. Leaving Niedre to nurse personal doubts, Esmalyn returned half an hour later and led them to the chamber.<br>
<br>
She glanced askance at Esmalyn. Disheveled hair, hood thrown back. A bandoleer housing balanced daggers crossed her left shoulder and came down at an angle, buckled around the right thigh. There was a softness about her face not common to Tier’Dal, but the scar across the eye surely diverted attention to it. As far as habits were concerned, rumors about her reluctance to work with others were right on target.<br>
 <br>
A warm air current brushed Niedre's cheek. She snapped out of her daze and faced the direction. The fidgeting nature of her movements was not lost to Esmalyn. “What is it?” she asked offhandedly.<br>
<br>
"I saw... Nothing.” <br>
<br>
Esmalyn moved her hands away from the opaline coffin and sat in silence.<br>
<br>
“Although long exposure to strong odors such as the bodies of slaves, incense, and mold will erode your sense of smell over time, you will learn to stretch the limits of other awareness. You were not born with extended ears simply to clip exploits onto them for bragging rights!”<br>
<br>
<i>Oh shut up, Hekzin. Why am I thinking of you now?</i><br>
<br>
Twenty meters ahead a stagnant pool supplied by a stalactite, the sound of dripping water amplified by the hollow, dark metal that formed the Tower of Frozen Shadows. Somewhere to the left the groaning of rotted wood. After a minute, she picked up the needle-thin knife and shim and slid them between the lid and casket. Inching slowly, deliberately, she came full circle. No surface defects, no triggers.<br>
<br>
She exhaled. “I need your hands.”<br>
<br>
Niedre entered the dome-shaped burial chamber. They faced each other across the dead. She was tall for a dark elf, one hand taller than Esmalyn. And vain.<br>
<br>
<i>Unwilling to crop that brazen long hair. How impractical in our present surroundings.</i> They reached down for the lid. Esmalyn caught a glimpse of cobwebs clinging to the fanned bottom. <i>She won’t even stoop to a braid.</i> <br>
<br>
”On three.”<br>
<br>
<i>Worst of all, she’s with the Mask.</i><br>
<br>
”One...two...” Esmalyn nodded once.<br>
<br>
The lid came free with an unnatural swoosh of air, chased by the crackle of eldritch magic. Neither of them moved. An amusing idea struck Esmalyn in spite of herself then: <i>This is why we reserve the right to charge so high a tariff.</i><br>
<br>
From the hallway blared a female voice, laughing, cajoling; ranging from a resonant child to the tear-streaked heaves of an old woman and ended with the wail of battered swine--each delivery pitched to freeze the marrow in bones. The transparent hair on the backs of both rogues’ neck rose to the occasion.<br>
<br>
<i>Tserrina.</i><br>
<br>
A knot twisted in Niedre's throat. The initial stun and the realization that she may not live passed, had been accepted. She spat, "Why didn’t you check for dweomers!”<br>
<br>
Esmalyn, canting her head to the side, asked, “Did you take care not to step on a sigil?”<br>
<br>
Niedre looked down. A marker illuminated the heal of her right boot in green light. Her eyes shot up to Esmalyn's. <i>Anger in those eyes,</i> Niedre thought. <i>She means to kill me if we live.</i> <br>
<br>
The wheezing from the hallway eventually faded. Their arms trembled from the extended hold. Of one accord Niedre and Esmalyn discarded the lid just as they put the pretense of stealth behind them. The lid cracked in half against the raised effigy of a dark knight, hairline cracks spread from the center.<br>
<br>
There lay an Erudite male in the coffin, the claymore in his hands extended beyond his feet. It had a demystifying effect on the riddle of the long, opaline coffin. Esmalyn almost sighed. He was dressed in velvet finery down to gold-dipped gloves.<br>
<br>
“You see?” Niedre pointed into the coffin. “The Gashrek Scrolls do not lie!”<br>
<br>
Esmalyn seized Niedre’s wrist away from the circlet and yelled: “The dance is just beginning!” It was the first time she raised her voice above a whisper since crawling through one of the chutes concealed by the talon-like buttresses outside.<br>
<br>
Niedre jerked her arm back. The source of Esmalyn’s agitation began in the hallway once more. Except it was not ethereal, but the real clash of metal striking stone, running inexorably towards them.<br>
<br>
Niedre reached for the circlet again. The skeleton’s neck snapped at the base and, taking a sword in her left hand, she shook the skull free. It bounced down the hallway and spun on its crown a few times before a giant boot crushed it.<br>
<br>
Arming her dagger, Niedre backed away until she hit the wall. Likewise armed, Esmalyn positioned herself behind the casket. She quipped, “How does one kill armor?”<br>
<br>
That decided the armor’s first target. Minus well take the brunt of it now, she thought. The...thing ducked into the chamber. Its helmet ground against the entry and loosened a piece of stone. Once inside, it turned a glowing-white stare on Esmalyn. A closed fist swooped at her. Easily dodged, but as it flew overhead the hum of air in its passing was a testament to the power behind it.<br>
<br>
Niedre crept forward on her toes. Normally inclined to open an assault with her dagger, she opted for the sword’s longer reach. It drew a line of sparks across the armor’s breastplate. The armor whirled on her, a fist striking down.<br>
<br>
<i>She cannot hope to stop it!</i><br>
<br>
Niedre caught the gauntlet by the handle of her sword. She nearly fell on her knees from the force, and her balance tipped. The other gauntlet caught her swordhand in an iron grip, squeezed until bones snapped by the numbers. The sword fell from the crushed fingers.<br>
<br>
Esmalyn had no intentions of dragging dead weight around, but the circlet still sat on that inbred's brow. She thrust dagger and sword into their sheaths with a <i>snick.</i> Hoisting a shield from the effigies nearly as long as her and twice as wide she slid a wrist through the handle and bashed the armor. The effort did little more than annoy it, but at least it turned around. Esmalyn saw Niedre hobble out of sight, the expression on her face full of spite. <br>
<br>
It was Esmalyn's turn to get tossed around like a rag doll. By chance she ended up under the shield. The pounding wouldn't relent, and it would not be long before the shield gave out. She would scream, but to what avail? Niedre would likely not return even if uninjured. In all probability, she was cutting the rope right now.<br>
<br>
Esmalyn promised herself not to return without good cause. <i>No, better cause. And alone.</i> She timed the next punch and scrambled out when the gauntlet reached its zenith. Her hand produced a tiny dagger and her wrist flicked for the eyes. It sank deep, breaking the plane of the visor. The armor clawed at it, moaned, and pushed the coffin over in a fit of rage.<br>
<br>
She leapt to her feet and abandoned the room, the treasures inside suddenly unimportant. She found Niedre at the chute's mouth, the rope cradled in her injured arm while her good hand cut.<br>
<br>
"I wouldn't do that," Esmalyn warned.<br>
<br>
”I should have never agreed!"<br>
<br>
<i>She sounds so petty.</i><br>
<br>
Esmalyn turned around. "Who's there?"<br>
<br>
"What?" It was Niedre. "How could they even consider you?" Accusing.<br>
<br>
Esmalyn looked up, eyes narrowed. "You spoiled <i>elg'caress.</i> Don't blame your incompetence on me."<br>
<br>
<i>That's the spirit!</i><br>
<br>
<i>I am going mad,</i> she thought.<br>
<br>
<i>Not quite. We are simply sharing a link.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Who is this?</i><br>
<br>
<i>Valdayana, none other. You'd better take action. Your friend is coming soon.</i><br>
<br>
Esmalyn blinked.<br>
<br>
<i>Pleasantly surprised, I take it.</i><br>
<br>
<i>I'm not a damned telepath. Neither do I remember inviting you into my mind.</i><br>
<br>
<i>D on't carp with me! Get the circlet.</i> The last word was accompanied by a mental jab.<br>
<br>
Esmalyn took a step back. Gathering herself, she unsheathed the dagger, turned Niedre around by the arm and drew a clean line across her throat. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 1/15/02 10:16:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/15/02 10:19:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fragments - The Frayed Ends (Part II)</span><hr size=1> <h4>© 2002 L.H.</h4><br>
Valdayana. The pretentious enchanter stricken with delusions of godhood. Not that it made a difference to Esmalyn. The closest she came to accepting a credo was a brush with the clergy of Luclin. But since then their fundamental belief had shifted, a signal that the goddess had as well.<br>
<br>
She sat in the corner of the dragonspire, waiting for a wizard to chance by. During the exchange she polished the circlet to its former luster then wiped the soot off her face. She could still taste the grit in her mouth from the chamber floor and periodically leaned over to spit. She also took care not to conceal her opinion of the enchanter during the conversation.<br>
<br>
<I>Wipe that grin off your face.<br>
<br>
Does it offend you?<br>
<br>
You are not worth my consideration.<br>
<br>
Obviously.</I> Sarcasm. Esmalyn wrapped the circlet in a cloth and tucked it underneath her tunic.<br>
<br>
<I>The arrangement has been made. Will you accept the terms?<br>
<br>
What of the ranger?</I><br>
<br>
A pause. <I>She is resourceful. She may be of use yet.</I><br>
<br>
The rogue felt the other's influence diminish. <br>
<br>
Esmalyn stepped away from the spires of Shadowhaven holding her gut. Travel by magical means wasn’t kind. She leaned over the waters and washed her hands and face while her innards anchored themselves to the lighter gravity on the moon. It was possible Millikin was away from the city on one of her many excursions. And highly likely that her quarters was clear of theft deterrents, mundane or otherwise.<br>
<br>
<I>Reasons why the witch asked for me.</I><br>
<br>
She did not break into the flat. She didn't ask after the target. Esmalyn browsed the merchant tents outside and replaced some items, but always with an eye on the corner door on the second floor. No telling what setting Millikin's inner clock had adjusted to without the sun to guide her hours.<br>
<br>
It was an hour before she approached the flat. The lock was fashioned after a popular design. She turned the doorknob and entered on the ‘click,’ shutting the door behind her. Waiting a moment for her eyes to adjust to the darkness, she took in her surroundings.<br>
<br>
A small flat with a single room. There were provisions for cooking and washing, the furnishings sparse and simplistic. In the rear and under a window Millikin rested on her back, eyes occasionally blinking in the meditative state of reverie.<br>
<br>
It wasn't long before Esmalyn found the medallion in a satchel. <I>How very trusting,</I> she thought. She rolled it between her fingers as she went over the conversation with Valdayana.<br>
<br>
<I>She did not only want to keep her alive, but ignorant of the folly for as long as possible.</I><br>
<br>
Esmalyn kicked the railing at Millikin's feet so hard the pegs shunted.<br>
<br>
<I>I spin my own chaos.</I><br>
<br>
Millikin sat bolt upright, shaking the reverie off. Her hand intrinsically reached for Swiftwind.<br>
<br>
<I>Ironic. We serve Innoruuk from time to time, whether or not we swoon to the sermon.</I><br>
<br>
Esmalyn waited for recognition on the ranger’s face.<br>
<br>
"You?" she asked.<br>
<br>
The rogue raised the medallion by the string. "Regards from your friend."<br>
<br>
Recognition changed into betrayal. Millikin tried to run Esmalyn through. Swiftwind struck the gaseous vapors of gate spells.<br>
<br>
A bottle crashed on the floor. Before the outline completely faded a distant voice whispered, "You should thank me." <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/15/02 10:20:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fragments - The Frayed Ends (OOC Notes)</span><hr size=1> Posted with the permission of all involved.<br>

<br>
Shadow Haven<br>
<br>
Millikin crumpled into a chair after her latest spate of vomiting.  A handful of blood flecked pale green stones were scattered on a table in front of her alongside the majority of her equipment.  The last thing the ranger expected she would be doing this evening was dry heaving periodots at a secluded inn in the Fordel District in Shadow Haven.  The elf leaned back in the chair and stared up at the ceiling.  She had been warned that eating them would make her sick.  At the time it seemed to be a worthwhile consideration. Hindsight, as always, proved to be 20/20 though and she mused that eating Valdayana’s supply of periodots was not the most effective and worthwhile means of dealing with her.  While Millikin didn’t begrudge the fact that she was paying the price for eating those gems in her wolf form, it did irk her that Valdayana was right about the end result.  She looked out the window of her rented room from old habit.  Neither the stars nor the moon was visible, and only served to remind her that technically she was in a subterranean series of caves and tunnels on the moon of Luclin.  ‘Why did she always have to be right?  And furthermore how did she always manage to get the upper hand in any dealings with her?’  Millikin slumped forward in her chair and closed her eyes.   <br>
<br>
Well, not entirely this time.  Millikin had something the enchanter wanted.  And she wasn’t going to get it with her current attitude.  A while back, Millikin had acquired a medallion section that Valdayana currently needed.  The piece itself was worthless to her but was a means to acquiring something of more immediate worth to her.  After going through a somewhat tangled skein to unravel what, Millikin learned that the enchanter was looking for entrance to Veeshan’s Peak, a sealed sanctuary for another sect of dragons and dragonkin called the Ring of Scale.  The Tunarean ranger would not be a willing party to any plot the Teir`Dal was scheming to undermine the interests of her goddess or further the objectives of whichever dark power the spellcaster had aligned herself with to increase her own personal powerbase.  When she questioned Valdayana as to her purpose to going to Veeshan’s Peak, the enchanter manipulated the direction of the conversation with off-the-wall statements, appeals to what the ranger owed her, and even placed Millikin on the defensive for questioning her motives in the first place.  The ranger eventually left in frustration, knowing nothing more as to the enchanter’s intentions as before she went to ask her, except that she was not going to give her the medallion piece as originally intended until she was sure its use would not be for some sinister means.  Feverishly she sat up and poured herself a glass of water from the pitcher on the table and swallowed it down, hoping she would not resume vomiting.  After a few moments she staggered over to the bed and wearily reached for the blanket lying at the foot of the bed.<br>
<br>
As a rule, Millikin was not one to question the concept of deific intervention in the lives of mortals.  Though she did tend to view that the objectives were ultimately for good or ill depending on the god involved and that sentient beings would (and should) react according to their nature but everything that happens is for some larger purpose.  As such, she did wonder at this very moment what possible reason Tunare could have for Millikin to be acquainted with an enchanter who would slander the goddess and denigrate her chosen servants.  The only thing she could think of was that Valdayana D`Varr was an example of how Millikin should NOT behave.  The ranger kicked her blanket aside as she mentally replayed the conversation in Skyshrine once again.  This time, mostly angry at herself that she allowed herself to be so utterly led astray from the topic at hand.  ‘Dark ranger.  Trust such a concept to come from a Teir`Dal.’  As the wood elf ranger fell into a disturbed state of reverie the talisman she always wore around her neck flickered briefly.  <br>
<br>
From the Demi-Plane of Nightmares, Terris Thule watched the world of Norrath, ever vigilant to find those who could satiate her desire.  Like many of the deities of Norrath, she drew sustenance from mortals.  For some it was not enough to have their worship, they required more from their devout and either fed off their emotions or the ones their followers engendered in others.  Whether or not such consumption of emotional energy actually strengthened the deity or simply a habitual facet of their persona to demand of their worshippers was unknown and certainly a subject of debate amongst religious leaders.  But what was a known fact is that Dream Scorcher sought the mental distress of those who experienced nightmares and a preferential taste for the nightmares of the innocent and good.  Whenever possible, she drew the spirits of such people into her realm for consumption.  In such a case, one could only remain in her realm for as long as their bodies physically slept, thus Terris Thule would expand one’s nightmares to astounding realism to convince her victim they were not dreaming and she could continue to feed from their fears and uncertainties.  Since Terris Thule’s power was not infinite, she selected her prey carefully to ensure she could keep them in her custody for as long as possible.  Those prone to fear would awaken themselves in a fit of terror or would be light sleepers where the slightest distraction from the material world would draw them from her clutches.  Those who were extremely strong willed tend to realize where they were and shatter the illusions of her nightmare world with their departure.  Therefore Terris Thule tended to steal away those who were both mentally and physically weary.<br>
<br>
Falling…<br>
<br>
‘Somehow… this isn’t my place.’  Millikin thought to herself<br>
‘Of course not.  You’ve been spirit shifted.’  The spirit wolf replied.<br>
‘To where?’  Millikin looked around.  Everything seemed to be a fugue.<br>
<br>
Falling…<br>
<br>
‘I do not know yet.  Allow me the control.’  The spirit wolf spoke into her mind once more.  <br>
<br>
Falling…<br>
<br>
‘I am more experienced in traversing different realms in this manner.  You cannot even find your way out of the Shadow Realms.  The spirit sensed the ranger’s hesitation.  ‘I will get us back to our own realm.’  In a second’s time the wolf spirit subsumed the elf’s.<br>
<br>
Falling… <br>
<br>
The lift stopped moving and without a word, Millikin Erreene stomped past Guard Pineshade.  The Kelethin guard watched her go with barely a nod in greeting.  The ranger’s reputation for mercurial mood swings was as well known as her reputation for ruthless efficiency.  Dressed in dark leathers and wielding serrated short blades, she made her way towards the Butcherblock Mountains.  A flash of eldritch light off to her right briefly caught her attention.  She turned to see a high elf wizard casting a fire based spell.  Millikin’s eyes narrowed when she saw the wizard’s target - a black wolf.  The wolf yelped in pain then leapt at its attacker.   Apparently this wizard was a novice to the Art because she was unable to cast another spell as the wolf continued to claw and bite her.  The wizard desperately turned to run towards the gates of Felwithe, when Millikin started to recite an incantation.  Grass and weeds shot up to wrap around the wizard’s ankles, slowing her flight to safety considerably.  The wizard watched horrorstruck as the wolf lunged for her throat and dragged her to the ground.  A twisted grin appeared on Millikin’s face as the wolf continued to maul the unconscious elf for several more moments before trotting off.  &quot;Next time stay behind the safety of your marble walls, Koada`Dal.&quot;  The ranger remarked coldly as she continued.<br>
<br>
Millikin was, once again, being sent on messenger errands to and from Kelethin, Kithicor, and Highpass Hold.  Acting as courier between the master rangers patrolling Kithicor and Faydark's Champions to keep tabs on the Teir`Dal activity in the area.  Initially she had been surprised to learn that a dark elf stronghold existed within Kithicor and that numerous dark elf agents ran between Highpass Hold and Neriak.  Surprise quickly turned to contempt when she also discovered that the orcs of Clan Schralok were permitted to live near the mountain pass to Highhold Keep.  Then at night the forests were overrun with undead.  <br>
<br>
‘These humans are useless.’ she concluded.  They could have easily called upon assistance from Freeport or even Qeynos to eradicate the Schralok orcs who hunted the tigers and wolves that once populated Kithicor forest to nigh extinction and then further worked to drive out the Teir`Dal from the forests.  She was fairly sure that even King Tearis Thex would have dispatched a contingent of troops to assist in that endeavor.  <br>
<br>
One day as she prowled Kithicor’s forests she ducked into the tunnel entrance leading to the halfling’s village to avoid the sudden downpour, when idea began to take shape.  ‘Water.’  She would contaminate the orcs’ water supply.  Instantly she thought of poisoning the entirety of Lake Kithicor to take out both the orcs and the dark elves but immediately decided against that.  Such an act would be too time consuming and likely have adverse effects on the animals that still remained relatively untainted by the corruption that permeated the forest.  She would lace their selected watering holes and decide on how to handle the dark elves later.  The ranger quickly decided on strychnine as the poison of choice.  Within a few weeks time, the orc population declined dramatically as many of them suddenly fell ill and died inexplicably.  A month later, the sudden plague that had stricken the orcs in Kithicor and spread to their kinsman in Highpass and on to the Mucktail Gnolls in Highpass caught the attention of the Church of Rodcet Nife.  By the time Millikin returned to Kelethin to report this incident to the guildmasters, several residents of Kithicor and Highpass citizens had fallen ill as well.  They had learned that the water supply had been poisoned.  Rumors persisted that the Teir`Dal were responsible and this was a prelude to another attack on Highhold Keep.<br>
<br>
She quickly resumed her old habits, terrorizing Crushbone orcs and prowling the fringes of Mistmoore Castle, slaying Mayong Mistmoore’s unwary retainers who lingered too long by themselves.  One day, her hunt went badly.  A band of fools had decided to raid Mistmoore castle.  They never made it beyond the main gates before the standard retinue of guards drove them off.  One of Mayong Mistmoore’s vampiric minions opted to oversee the slaughter and caught sight of the ranger hiding in the shadows of the outer wall.  In a blur of motion, she was upon the ranger cursing and clawing.  The last thing Millikin felt was a bone jarring kick…<br>
<br>
… Jumping to her feet, she reached for her sword and had it clear of its sheath before one could blink.<br>
<br>
‘Why was Esmalyn in her room?’  Confusion turned to anger as she saw her medallion dangling from the dark elf’s fingertips.  Without thought, she lunged towards the rogue only to strike air as she disappeared.<br>
<br>
A rage filled howl echoed through the passages of Shadow Haven.  “Valdayana!”<br>

<br>
     Enraged at learning Valdayana had stolen her medallion piece, the Feir`Dal ranger slammed out of her room and stormed to the Trade Commissioners' Office of Shadow Haven, scrawled two messages for delivery and ran towards the Luclin Nexus, reverting to wolf form en route.  As she approached the Antonican Scion, the wizard responsible for activating the portal that leads to the continent of Antonica on Norrath she heard a troll dressed in black plate mail inquiring how long until the portal would be reactivated.<br>
  &quot;Approximately fifteen minutes.&quot;  The portal guardian replied.<br>
  &quot;Activate it now.&quot;  Millikin stated in a dangerously calm tone to the wizard.  He blinked in astonishment.  Usually the ranger sat quietly abiding by the pre-established schedule of portal activation.  Never before did he hear a word of complaint issued forth from her about the length of time required to summon the energies required to transport people back to Norrath.<br>
 &quot;Did I stutter?&quot;  She growled at the wizard.  Now that he thought about it, he never recalled seeing her in wolf form either.  Perhaps it was a grave matter requiring her attention in Antonica.  Without another word the Scion began tracing an arcane pattern of sigils in midair to call forth the magical energies needed to transport the latest group down to Norrath.<br>
<br>
     As motes of eldritch light coalesced around the lupine ranger, Millikin entertained thoughts of tearing the luhtmauyar limb from limb, then searching through the remaining pieces for her medallion.  The momentary disorientation that quickly followed the teleport brought some semblance of rational thought.  <br>
  'Her thrice damned rune spell would make that a difficult feat to accomplish immediately.'  Millikin bolted towards the western plains of Karana.  As another downpour of rain started and she ducked into a barn to wait out the storm.  She shook her fur dry and sat at the barn door, glaring at the rain.<br>
  'Get rid of the rune spell.'  Conversations of this nature with the wolf spirit that had taken up semi-permanent residence within Millikin were often in this vein of late.  And truth to tell, a part of the wood elf longed to allow the spirit to take over to do precisely what he would suggest on occasion.<br>
  'Easy in theory.  Harder in practice.  Particularly if she recasts it.  And she has other spells.'<br>
  'Her magic is weak.'  The wolf spirit spoke with a note of disdain as he began to take a visible though ethereal form beside the ranger.<br>
  'Then you quite clearly don't pay much attention to the physical world.'  Millikin remarked dryly.<br>
  'It is devoid of faith.'  The wolf spirit spoke.  'What does she do when it fails?  Eldritch magic does not function the same way as yours and hers is almost purely eldritch.'<br>
  'Yes, yes.  Mine is primarily elemental.  As are druids and wizards.  And<br>
necromancers and shaman draw upon forces of entropy and spiritism.  All forms of magic are counterbalanced in some way.  I want the medallion that she stole from me back, not a lesson in the concepts of magic.'   She snapped at the spirit.  <br>
 'Then think.'  The wolf spirit growled in response.  Millikin paced around<br>
inside the barn.  <br>
 'Why would she steal something I'd have given her had she been forthright<br>
about it and asked.'<br>
 'Because she doesn't respect you.'  The spirit spoke matter-of-factly.  'One does not steal from someone they have a modicum of respect for.  Her ilk only respect power and in her eyes you are lacking.'<br>
Millikin bristled and turned to the spirit but did not respond.<br>
<br>
     As the storm continued, Millikin circled the barn muttering to herself.  <br>
  &quot;Strengths that's easy.  She's a spellcaster specializing in mind control through charm, illusions and alteration and also augmenting allies and deteriorating foes.&quot;  <br>
She walked around in a circle recalling the spells she knew and had seen enchanters cast.  Different protection spells, charm, mesmerization, fear, root, stun, spells to deplete one's mana necessary to use magic.  Countless illusions, invisibility, divination spells, levitation, a personally much hated gravity reversal spell, a distracting spell that erodes one's resistance to magic, some mind warping spells that triggered pain, dispels to eliminate various protection and enhancement spells cast upon them.<br>
  &quot;Now, to get around them.&quot;  Enhanced resistance to magic was an obvious initial conclusion.  Though some spells would not be so easily bypassed nor did Millikin think she had the strength of will to withstand a perpetual onslaught of spells.  But she knew a few tricks.  She  was well aware that spells required line of sight to take effect and decided she could use that fact to her advantage.<br>
 <br>
'Become the hunter, not the hunted.'  The spirit wolf said calmly as his form dispersed in the rain that had slowed to a light drizzle.  Millikin continued her trek across the Karanas.  It was common knowledge that spellcasters were physically weaker than the average person.  They spent so much time studying to expand their intellectual ability that their strength would atrophy from lack of physical exertion.  Their overall health would deteriorate due to exposure to magical energies, strange substances used in research and spell components, and in some cases pacts with dark powers.  Eventually they would have access to magic to enhance their physical prowess to an extent but they were still a far cry beneath their non-caster counterparts in those areas.  <br>
<br>
     For some reason, Millikin suddenly recalled a threat the enchanter had made against her once about poisoning her with a contact toxin.  The ranger dismissed the threat as an idle one as she had withstood Trakanon's poison breath on numerous occasions.  She also had means of dealing with poisonous wounds that Valdayana was clearly ignorant of.  That recall brought another idea to mind and Millikin detoured on her trip to Qeynos.  <br>
  'Can't have her knowing what I'm up to.'  The ranger purchased a tiger eye from one of the merchant vendors in Qeynos, keeping a wary eye open for zealous Bloodsabers or corrupt guards.  She looked over the stone briefly before slipping it into her pocket.  Tiger eyes possessed the ability to block anyone from scrying or using other forms of clairvoyant and divination magic to ascertain the possessor's activities or whereabouts.  Which was not to say more traditional means of employing someone to tail them would not be as effective, but very few people had the ability to follow a ranger who did not wish to be found.<br>
<br>
     A few days later at the entrance to Blackburrow, Millikin sat waiting for another's arrival.  She listened to the sound of combat around her.  The Blackburrow Gnolls defended the entrance to their stronghold against all outsiders.  That defense entailed attacking the human and half elven populace of Qeynos and Surefall Glade as well as any travelers through the area on sight.  At least if they thought they had the advantage.  Some, however, were lacking in wisdom.  Like the two who decided that the head of the wood elf sitting on the ground would make a great trophy.<br>
 &quot;I claim your blood in the way of my Father!&quot;  The first gnoll yapped as he took a swing at Millikin's head.  In an eyeblink, the ranger had drawn her sword and plunged the blade straight through the gnoll's chest.  In a fluid motion, she withdrew her blade and kicked the corpse forward to remove it from her blade then turned to the other gnoll.<br>
  &quot;Erm...&quot;   The second gnoll turned tail to run at the ranger's glare as she wiped off her blade and sheathed it.  She picked up the bow that had been siting on the ground beside her, nocked an arrow and let fly.  The arrow ripped through the gnoll's leather backing, stopping only after imbedding itself in the gnoll's lungs.  His death was more painful.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nice shot.&quot;  <br>
<br>
     Millikin turned around to see Kinderfeld standing behind her.  The dark haired Feir`Dal was wearing dark tinted armor, the preferred style of those who share his profession.  She personally thought his polite mannerisms and bearing were a stark contrast to the general attitude of rogues.  But then he's not adverse to placing a dagger in someone's back should the need arise.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Diole lle.  Thank you for agreeing to meet with me.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Your message sounded urgent.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;I'm not sure about urgent.  But its something I feel must be addressed quickly.  Do you make poisons?&quot;  The ranger asked.<br>
  &quot;On occasion I've been known to dabble in them.  Why do you ask?&quot;  Kinderfeld was curious as to why a ranger would seek to use poisons.<br>
  &quot;I need to replicate the effects of one in particular.  Of the few rogues I know on a personal basis I either cannot trust them as far as I can throw them, or they simply don't have the inclination for the practice.  And I need discretion as to its creation and the reasons.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;Which poison?&quot;  Millikin handed Kinderfeld a battered old book she had come across years ago.  <br>
  &quot;The page is dog eared.&quot;  The rogue thumbed through the book, scanning the page contents.  Some of the poisons he knew by the component listing alone.  He stopped on the one page that was folded over and read it.  He looked up at Millikin and raised a questioning eyebrow.<br>
  &quot;Unusual request.  But yes I can make it.&quot;  He closed the book and handed it back to her.<br>
  &quot;Can you modify its method of application?&quot;  <br>
  &quot;That depends.  Possibly with some experimentation.  Who is this for?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Valdayana D`Varr.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Now this I simply must know.&quot;<br>
Millikin looked around to ensure no one was in earshot then related to Kinderfeld about the medallion piece.  How she obtained it and found out its purpose.  Her attempt to find out why Valdayana wanted it, who then hired an acquaintance of hers to steal it from her.  The rogue listened quietly to the ranger's story.<br>
  &quot;You think this will work?&quot;<br>
  &quot;No reason it should not.  I want my medallion piece back, and despite being furious with her at the moment, I don't particularly want her dead.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I hope you realize what you are jumping into.&quot;  Kinderfeld warned.<br>
  &quot;Yes, where angels fear to tread.  I know.  We'll see soon enough I suppose.&quot; <br>

It did not shock her, the dark elves always lived in such a web of deception, lies and hatred.  Once in a while a few found their way out of the tangled mess, but then this one was a rogue after all, and her reputation was not the most savory.  It was the pure betrayal to Millikin that struck her so deeply, and now Millikin would pursue the source of the theft, and Autumn vowed to pursue its instrument.<br>
<br>
She stalked from the inn in the North quarter of the city of Freeport, and in passing she grabbed a young lad by the back of his shirt that she spotted running mail for the League of Antonican Bards earlier. He was still earning his way amongst the ranks.  He turned startled then smiled at the minstrel as she let go of the runner and smoothed his shirt.  Autumnwyld looked at him with a moment of serious consideration of his skill then pressed a small folded parchment in his hand along with a few platinum coin in way of payment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Take this to the Ranger they call Millikin, your instructions on are the envelope.  I have asked her to compensate you further once the message reaches her hands.  Let her know I will be quite unreachable in Neriak for a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
She ignored his startled glance as she was rapidly whisked away with drum and song to a speed that was a force to be reckoned with.  She was grateful at least Millikin provided her with an inkling of where to find the rogue, now it was a matter of getting there.  Her song shifted as she rounded the bend into the western half of the city, a soft mist concealing her while she continued her pace and dodged through the filth that patrolled this end, her destination to the land of the dark elves.<br>
<br>
====================================<br>
<br>
Autumnwyld picked her way through the gloom and doom of the infested excuse for a forest muttering more than once about the stagnant smell of the water that was filled with piranhas.  She paused long enough to spot one of the border patrols on his rounds, and a wicked grin crossed her face as she quickly exchanged hand drums for swords.  He would not have noticed the bard were it not for the sudden binding his body experienced, musical chains surrounded the guard as the bard advanced, her song already shifting to one of a battlecry.  She swiftly cut the dark elf down, his own attempts at defense meager at best to her skill, and as he slid from her blade to his death, uttering vengeance.  Autumn's baleful glare followed as she shortly remarked...<br>
<br>
&quot;Bring it on.&quot;<br>
<br>
As she drew near the entrance to the city she quickly reached in her packs and withdrew the mask of deception she was often fond of, and covering her face with the object she spoke the words that would activate it.  With some sneaking, hiding, and the gift of the mask she neatly slipped in to the city without incident.  She bit her lower lip a moment, one small slip and she was surely in a significant amount of trouble here.  She approached one of the less-than intelligent looking parlors as she made the effort of appearing a warrior from her plate armor.  After a moment of query and the exchange of a few platinum Autumnwyld was already skirting her way across the edge of the city and into the inn he mentioned seeing Esmalyn disappear into.<br>
<br>
After a moment's haggling, the parting with a small gem, and quite a trial on her patience, Autumnwyld was heading upstairs to room number four.  She had no doubts the rogue was waiting for something, or someone, but she was most certain the rogue was not expecting this.  Using the key that she had more than overpaid the innkeeper for Esmalyn's door opened with a click, and Autumnwyld softly stepped in, ready to duck a flying dagger if need be but speaking her mind in the process.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you and I should have a small chat Esmalyn.&quot;<br>

She rubbed the liquid on a pulse-point and raised the wrist to inhale the aromatic sample. She heard the steps on the stairs, and the unexpected turn of the doorknob. Autumn stood in the doorway with a key in hand.<i> I must pay the innkeeper a visit.</i></font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     "I think you and I should have a small chat Esmalyn." </font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     "What a pleasant surprise." Esmalyn slowly lowered her hands. "What boon brings a bard to our dappled gloom?" She stood the bottle on a crystal tray chased with silver handles.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     From Autumn's perspective, the dark elf in front of the mirror wore a translucent, shimmering robe that   left little to the imagination given the heat-sight nature of ultravision. The wide sleeves nearly covered her hands and the front parted down the middle. The reflection with wet, clinging hair did not bother to cover herself. Autumn relaxed a little when a flying dagger did not materialize, although Esmalyn's greeting was a threat in itself; she knew her real identity and was willing to use it to her advantage.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     As if reading the bard's thoughts, Esmalyn turned away from the dresser and said, "A message within a   message. Quite in character for my ilk, yes?"</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     "I don't want to tarry," Autumn admitted as she closed the door behind her. "Cut to the chase and I will  leave sooner than later."</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     "Kindly drop your instruments."</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     Autumn turned her nose up at that. These were not store-bought pieces of wood, brass, and metal. Like the rest of her valued possessions, there was a history to their acquisition paid in sweat and blood. She sighed, though, and complied, letting the backpack slip from her arm to the floor. She was more than a match for an unarmed Tier'Dal with her voice alone.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     ”If you merely hum a note I will tear your tongue out by the root--" By Marr, was she that readable? The threat was nearly enough to move Autumn to the challenge. Could Esmalyn react that fast? No telling what secrets the strange drawings on the walls harbored "--and personally see to it that it ends up in a cleric's stew. Besides," the rogue stretched her arms above her head, "I paid well at the <i>El'lar d'Ssinssrigg</i>. Don't spoil it."</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     Autumn had enough of the debauchery. It was apparent Esmalyn's present boarding was provided in part or whole by Valdayana D'Varr. To add insult to injury, Esmalyn flaunted the fact. "Why did you do it?" Autumn forced the words through her teeth.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     "Some fruit?" The rogue proffered a wicker basket with one hand and raised a fluted wineglass with the   other.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     "Why!" Autumn's hands balled into fists at her sides.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     "Watch your temper, Songweaver." Esmalyn took a sip, let the wine sit on her tongue, swallowed, and deliberately took her time answering. "There's a foreign inflection when you raise your voice. Do you need to ask why?"</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     "Millikin--" Autumn whispered the name; the Erreene's habit of felling Tier'Dal guards was common knowledge this side of the continent “--trusted you. Does that count for so little?"</font><br>
<br>
<font face=”Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif”>     "She holds no love for me or any Tier'Dal, just as you don't. We used each other. Yes, used is as good a word as any other. A convenient system to gain access where the other couldn't by herself." </font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     Autumn was about to protest. The rogue had time to interrupt, but decided to let the truth of her words sink in like water through sand. A moment later, Autumn snapped her jaw shut. "It was unnecessary," she insisted.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     "You'd rather she continue blind to the truth, that the charade drag out?" Esmalyn dropped into a chair, tucking her legs in. Her arms hung lazily over the armrests as she waited for a response.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     "You disgust me." Autumn couldn't find a justification for the rogue's actions no matter how she presented  it. "You could be responsible for untold pain and suffering." She took a step away from Esmalyn with her back to the wall, and plucked her backpack by the strap.</font><br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     Esmalyn's eyes flickered, but her mouth did not move.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">     Moment's later she was alone again. The rogue glanced at her few belongings. Valdayana was due to collect  the medallion in the halls of the Ebon Mask in five hours. The <i>El'lar d'Ssinssrigg</i> did wonders for the knots in her back, but it never balmed the weary mind. Jamming the chair against the door she crawled into bed to get whatever rest she could find before the road called again. It wouldn't be long before the city's nobles caught onto her lie about the missing Niedre, and she would not willingly tell Valdayana that retribution was right around the corner. Autumn's visit proved that much.</font></p> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 2/1/02 2:18:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(2/1/02 2:06:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fragments </span><hr size=1> El'lar d'Ssinssrigg: House of Pleasure<br>

<br>
<br>
The Bazaar<br>
<br>
     The dark furred timber wolf entertained herself by running along the cobbled pathways past the various vendors stalls and stables, occasionally she would sneak into the stalls to startle the more skittish horses before being chased off by one of the stable hands.  As she contemplated heading to the Dawnshroud Mountains, a familiar scent crossed the lupine ranger's olfactory senses.  The wolf ran her tongue across her teeth and followed where her nose led.  Millikin had unfinished business with her and was prepared to complete it and deal with the repercussions.  Or so she believed.<br>
     The dark elf enchanter glanced over at the wolf and traced an arcane pattern in midair in the ranger's direction.  The ranger blinked at the surge of mental energy and reciprocated the gesture.  Millikin invoked earth elementals to surround the enchanter with an invisible protective barrier, those attempting to strike her physically would find out how sharp durable rocks could cut.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;I want my medallion piece back.&quot;  Millikin announced bluntly in spirit speech.<br>
  &quot;Then go get it.  I loaned it out.&quot;  Valdayana replied cheerfully.<br>
  &quot;You get it.&quot;  Millikin was really not in the mood to play mind games.<br>
  &quot;I will.  In a week or two.  Or three.&quot;  The enchanter sat down, folding her legs beneath her, now eye level to the ranger currently in wolf form.<br>
  &quot;Now.&quot;  Millikin growled softly, clicking her teeth.<br>
  &quot;It's not as if you can do anything here right now anyway.&quot;  Valdayana reached over and poked the ranger in her side just below her shoulder blade.<br>
  &quot;You are certain of that?&quot;  Millikin replied, the beginnings of a wolfish grin appearing on her face.<br>
  &quot;The guards enforce this area as a neutral zone.&quot;  Valdayana stated matter-of-factly.  Millikin, of course, already knew that, and also knew that there was a discordant amphitheater for duels should parties be so inclined.<br>
  &quot;...unless of course you can manage to get me to the arena in the back.&quot;  The last part was stated with an air of smug confidence.  Millikin wasn't sure if the enchanter was secure in her knowledge that Millikin couldn't get her to the arena or that such an encounter would be totally one sided.  In any event, Millikin had her own plans.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Who said I'd be spending time in any arena?&quot;<br>
  &quot;You won't get the medallion from me here otherwise by force.  Not that it matters since I don't have it.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Who said anything about force?&quot;  Millikin grinned evilly.<br>
  &quot;Said.  Hinted.  Same difference.&quot;  Valdayana shrugged.<br>
<br>
     In an eye blink, the dark furred wolf transformed back into a wood elf and began to search through her backpack and extracted a steel flask.  Whistling nonchalantly, Millikin unscrewed the lid and tossed the contents onto Valdayana.  The pale white liquid seeped through her clothing and in her skin, leaving a trace coppery smell.  The Dark elf ran her hands over her clothes.  The aroma was quite strong and she quickly changed her mind about attempting to identify the substance by smell.  In the back of her mind, Valdayana felt the effects of the aroma trying to disorient her thinking, but centuries of fine-tuning her mental fortitude enabled her to expel the effects, but not before the sinister poison served its true purpose.  The substance quickly crystallized with exposure to air and if done so on flesh or if swallowed, the poison would render the mana or magical energy of a spellcaster useless.  The enchanter looked over at Millikin as she realized what was happening.  Too late to do anything.<br>
<br>
  &quot;If you had asked, I'd have given you the medallion piece back.&quot;  She calmly stood up after a few moments. <br>
  &quot;You mean like when I asked you what it was for in the first place?&quot;  Millikin responded.  <br>
  &quot;You never asked me.&quot;  Valdayana stated.<br>
  &quot;Yes I did.  And it took nearly all my restraint to keep from tearing your head off when I got your response.&quot;  Millikin gazed straight at her.<br>
  &quot;You were hostile.  How was I to make a rational decision with your fearful visage hovering in front of me?&quot;  <br>
  &quot;Don't patronize me.&quot;  Millikin would not be swayed by Valdayana's false words of the ranger's skills of intimidation.  Valdayana poked her in the arm, several of the tiny crystalline droplets shattered at the contact.  <br>
  &quot;Dammit.  You got it on me.&quot;  Millikin looked at her arm; already she noticed the faint coppery aroma.<br>
  &quot;Oops.&quot;  Valdayana replied with a look of innocence on her face that belied her tone.  &quot;I'll wager you're more susceptible to it than me too.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;Lets just say you're more susceptible to the effects than I am since it takes away the one thing you value.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;It hasn't hampered me though.  Watch.&quot;  Valdayana employed a bit of prestidigitation (unnoticed by the ranger) and traced another arcane pattern in midair at the ranger, subtlety activating one of the myriad magical items in her possession.  Millikin felt the effects of the previous spell ebb, the effects replaced by a similar weaker spell.  <br>
  &quot;I'm still capable of removing my blessings from you by replacing it with an inferior spell.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Already you're weakening.&quot;  Millikin rocked back and forth from her heels to toes, hands clasped behind her back, grinning.<br>
  &quot;Don't be ridiculous.  I simply forgot where I wrote the incantation for Breeze in my spellbook.  Back when I was rising to power, when trakaraptors still roamed the Commonlands, &quot; Millikin hid a smile at that remark, trust Valdayana to somehow know a comment she made to Autumn in reference to the luhtmauyar's age.  &quot;Breeze didn't exist as a spell.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Suddenly Millikin's vision blurred momentarily.  She shook her head slightly as the dark elf came into focus once again.  If Valdayana noticed the poison's secondary effect taking hold on the ranger she gave no outward indication as she sat down once more.  For her own part, Millikin found it difficult to focus on a singular thought pattern for any great length of time.  She carefully watched Valdayana D'Varr for several moments.  'She's not attacking… She took something.  What?… A friend?  No…  who is she then?  Millikin's thoughts were a jumble when suddenly the Teir`Dal spoke to her.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Why are you disturbing my meditation now?&quot;  <br>
  &quot;Who me?&quot;  Millikin looked at her quizzically.  She didn't say anything in the past several moments.<br>
  &quot;Yes you.  The only ugly ranger around here I can see.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I'm ugly now?&quot;  Millikin's eyes crossed momentarily and she started wavering momentarily then stopped.<br>
  &quot;You don't match, and your ykesha is beyond outdated.&quot;  Valdayana replied with all the authority of a fully sworn officer of the fashion police.  Millikin looked down at herself.  She wore chain armor of various craftsmanship tinted in shades of green, brown, and grey - ideal coloration for one who finds themself at home in the forests.  She looked at her swords at either side, confusion etched on her face.  'A ykesha?   I thought it was a Swiftblade.  Or was it was called Swiftwind… '<br>
<br>
  &quot;That's what this is?&quot;  She studied the Swiftblade of Zek closely for several moments.<br>
  &quot;Now run along.  I have mysteries to comprehend that extend beyond what your meager intellect can fathom.&quot;  Valdayana waved her off.  'Now that sounded interesting.'  Millikin looked over at the dark elf.<br>
  &quot;Like what?&quot;<br>
  &quot;For instance why certain annoying rangers aren't culled by their kindred as children and grow up into adults who make their family wish they had done so.&quot;<br>
    Millikin's eyesight blurred once again.  'Was that an insult?  Maybe it was a comparison of civilization versus savagery.'   <br>
  &quot;Oh that's easy to answer.&quot;  Millikin responded.  &quot;I think.&quot;<br>
  &quot;From your perspective, not mine.&quot;  Valdayana replied loftily.  &quot;I have to judge the reactions of many since my personal actions can impact the world, as you are no doubt aware.&quot;<br>
  Millikin wavered slightly, taking a half-step to keep from stumbling.<br>
  &quot;As I said, its beyond your ken.  Run along now before I forget myself and make your mind more liquid than it already is.&quot;<br>
  'Liquid… slippery like quicksilver…  Why was the name Quicksilver familiar?'  Millikin's thoughts raced.  'Why can't I think straight?  The poison?'<br>
  &quot;Your perspective is irrelevant.  You aren't a ranger.  Or are you?&quot;  Millikin responded, somehow the realization that she was being denigrated started to register with her as the effects of the poison began to wear off.<br>
  &quot;Dark elves can't be rangers.  That should answer your question.&quot;  While the Feir`Dal mulled over that statement, Valdayana discreetly hid her stave and replaced it with a shortsword she had absconded long ago.<br>
  'She's right.  They can't be rangers.'   &quot;Maybe you aren't really a dark elf.&quot;  Millikin countered after a few moments' thought.<br>
  &quot;Maybe not but then if I was a ranger wouldn't I run around with a sword?&quot;  Valdayana suggested.<br>
  &quot;Like the one in your hand?&quot;  Millikin pointed.<br>
  &quot;How did that get there?&quot;  Valdayana quickly put the shortsword away and once again held her Shissar staff in her hand.  &quot;Besides, I wouldn't be caught dead in the chain mail tunics rangers wear.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Well no self-respecting ranger would carry a shield.  Nor would a warrior, now that you mention it.&quot;  Millikin said after a moment's pause.<br>
  &quot;So call me a paladin and be done with it since that's the obvious conclusion.&quot;  The Teir`Dal announced.  Millikin nodded momentarily as she continued.  &quot;I AM devoted and selfless, constantly taking time to listen to you and the other meaningless people around me.&quot;<br>
     That didn't quite seem right.  Millikin shook her head.<br>
  &quot;No, that's not right.  Paladins can't be dark elves… err that is, dark elves can't be paladins.  Who exactly are you again?&quot;  Millikin looked over at her quizzically.<br>
  &quot;Valdayana D`Varr, second-born daughter to the D`Varr family of Neriak.&quot;  She stated grandly.  &quot;You may have heard of us.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Hrm, I don't think so…&quot;  The Feir`Dal ranger shook her head once again, though the dark elf's name was familiar.  'She's a spellcaster obviously.  Her hideously ugly tunic would preclude any other occupation on sheer eccentricity alone if nothing else.  And she was making comments about MY wardrobe?'  Millikin cleared her throat but Valdayana continued.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You may wish to watch your back.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;Why?&quot;  Millikin turned around but saw nothing but the vendor booth behind her.<br>
  &quot;You've failed to take into consideration that while I may be a loving and caring paladin…&quot;  Valdayana quietly snickered to herself then took a more somber mien.  &quot;My sister is more wayward, and has pursued the necromantic arts.&quot; <br>
  &quot;So…&quot;  Millikin looked at Valdayana blankly.<br>
  &quot;If she were to learn that a ranger was trying to attack me, I fear the end result would be that she would acquire a skeleton pet wearing ugly green chain mail.  She isn't bound by the same constraints of morality as I.&quot; <br>
     Millikin rolled her eyes.  The last thing she was worried about was Valdayana's sister.  Necromancer or otherwise. 'What was it this dark elf stole from her again?' <br>
  &quot;If you were really a paladin, why would I attack you and why would you associate with…  She paused momentarily to recall the word.    …a gurthagular?&quot;<br>
  Valdayana glanced at Millikin with an air of superiority.  <br>
  &quot;You'll have to ask yourself that.  I can't read minds.  Well, I choose not to in your case as it's devoid of substance.&quot;  Millikin's eyes narrowed darkly at the insult as Valdayana stood up.  &quot;As to my sister, well the ties of family are binding.  You should know that since your own family opted not to slaughter you even after your display of ill traits.&quot;<br>
  &quot;You know my family?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Knew.  How long has it been since returned to Kelethin?&quot;  Valdayana asked innocently but the statements implication was obvious.  Millikin grinned to herself.  As it just so happened, she had visited her parents and sister earlier that day after learning a new spellcasting technique from one of the hierophants in Kelethin before meeting up with… 'What was her name again?  Saldaria.'  Had Millikin taken the implied threat seriously, the enchanter would have found the ranger's fingers around her neck, ready to snap it like a twig before she could draw another breath.<br>
  &quot;You probably don't even know who I am.  Much less my family.&quot;  <br>
<br>
     Inexplicably the enchanter walked off, trailed by the ranger, to the duelists' arena before she sat down in the stadium seats.  Millikin looked down to the main combat area.  Despite the fact that her thoughts were a jumble, one word stood out in memory as she looked around.<br>
  &quot;Discord.&quot;  She whispered, mostly to herself.<br>
  &quot;You may be brighter than you look.&quot;  Valdayana commented, her eyes half closed.  Millikin turned to her.<br>
  &quot;Why are you here?&quot;<br>
  &quot;For some peace and quiet that is not happening.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I can't remember what exactly I'm angry with you about.&quot;  Millikin closed her eyes, consciously trying to remember the specifics that seemed hidden in a mental fog as the effects of the poison were dissipating.<br>
  &quot;Hmm?  If you were angry with me, why didn't you say so?&quot;<br>
  &quot;I was certain I did.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Speak up next time.  Now what is it?&quot;  Valdayana spoke briskly.<br>
  &quot;You though I can't quite recall what.&quot;  In her mind's eye, the ranger saw a metal shard marked with glyphs.<br>
  &quot;Let me know when you do.  As always I'll be more than happy to help you.&quot;  She looked over at Millikin, studying the elf's appearance, stance, mannerisms, and facial expressions.  Quickly she analyzed them to ascertain the ranger's possible reaction.<br>
  &quot;You stole something from me.  A piece of metal.&quot;  Millikin opened her eyes; her voice's inflection changed from accusation to a more questioning note in the last sentence.<br>
  &quot;I don't engage in petty theft.  I have minions for that.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Same difference.  You're still a thief.&quot;  Millikin replied.  &quot;Now if I could just remember what…&quot;<br>
  &quot;This?&quot;  Valdayana stood up and held out a necklace she had around her neck for the ranger to examine.  Millikin leaned closer to take a look and immediately her eyes widened in recognition at some of the markings visible on the pendant.  Instantly she remembered the battle with the skeleton with Dermonar where she had lured the skeleton around the riverbanks that fed into Ill Omen Lake while the paladin dispatched a drachnid that had approached during the melee.<br>
  &quot;That's it!&quot;  <br>
  &quot;Not quite.&quot;  Valdayana corrected, releasing the necklace to fall back into her clothes.  &quot;You had only a piece.&quot;<br>
  &quot;From the skeleton.&quot;  Millikin nodded.<br>
  &quot;A useless piece of a shattered relic… I had the means to restore it to its glory to help unravel the disappearance of the iksar tribes.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Yes, and you stole a piece from me--&quot;  Millikin paused at the mention of the iksar tribes disappearing.  &quot;I thought they killed themselves off.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Sometimes people get stepped on in the pursuit of knowledge, unfortunate but true.  You've overreacted in your response I believe.&quot;  She shrugged.  &quot;It's your call to make, and I really can't argue but when your friends start dying due to my current inability to protect them, you know who's head the blame will lie on.&quot;<br>
  &quot;What?&quot;  The last statement in particular struck a nerve with the ranger.<br>
  &quot;I'm not going to explain it to you unless you're really as daft as I insinuate.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Why do you care one way or another?&quot;  Millikin was not about to admit that Valdayana's statement caught her unprepared.<br>
  &quot;The question really is, why don't you.&quot;  Valdayana replied.<br>
  &quot;You go through a lot of trouble to display your contempt of the world.  Why do you care about anyone else's welfare.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Perhaps I get angry because I do care?  Valdayana suggested, poking Millikin in the arm as if to physically emphasize the mental jab to the ranger's conscience her statement was.<br>
  &quot;Because you don't care.&quot;  Millikin's eyes narrowed slightly, but the self-doubt at her own actions was evident to the Teir`Dal.  <br>
  &quot;It doesn't really matter what you think though.&quot;  Valdayana poked Millikin once again, noting the ranger's silence.<br>

<br>
<br>
  &quot;Do you follow the Winding Way?&quot;  Millikin asked after a long silence.<br>
  &quot;Define the Winding Way.&quot;  Valdayana poked Millikin.  The ranger reached up to run her hand along the back of her neck trying to think of how to summarize the philosophy she was referring to.<br>
  &quot;Well basically, there's no purpose but to seek enlightenment… &quot;  Millikin started, pointedly ignoring the luhtmauyar's jabs.<br>
  &quot;I'm not that far gone.&quot;  Valdayana poked her again, knowing it would not be long before her prodding would incite the young ranger. <br>
  &quot;It's called the Winding Way because you progress at your own pace, but the general belief is things come around.  Someone you learn from may be someone you teach later in life.  And vice versa.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;I do my own thing.&quot;  Valdayana poked Millikin once again for emphasis, who nodded slowly and bit her bottom lip once as Valdayana continued.  &quot;As I said you can do what you want.  I won't lose my temper, I'm not that kind of person.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Maybe I misjudged you.&quot;  Millikin spoke after a few moments, frowning slightly, mostly at herself, when Valdayana poked her yet again.<br>
  &quot;And quit poking me.  You're getting that stuff on me.&quot;  The wood elf knelt down and began to rummage through her backpack, oblivious to the fact that Valdayana was grinning like the Cheshire cat as she stood over Millikin watching her with skillfully feigned disinterest.<br>
  &quot;Do me a favor please?&quot;  Millikin asked as she found the desired item and she worked to fish it out from beneath the plethora of items stored in her backpack and looked up at the enchanter.<br>
  &quot;Hmm?&quot;  Valdayana's eyebrows rose speculatively as she waited for Millikin to continue.<br>
  &quot;The next time you want something from me, can you dispose of the condescending attitude?&quot;  Finally pulling out the vial, Millikin stood up and held it up to the light to inspect briefly.&quot;<br>
  &quot;You have more poison for me?&quot;  Valdayana grinned at Millikin smugly.<br>
  &quot;This is the antidote.&quot;  Millikin spoke quietly.  <br>
  &quot;Ah, you've come to your senses.&quot;  Valdayana watched as Millikin tentatively offered her the antidote but made no move to take it.  &quot;Are you sure you want me to have that?&quot;  <br>
  Millikin nodded.  &quot;Yes.&quot;  Her fingers closed around the vial slightly but she still held it out.  &quot;Why?&quot;<br>
  &quot;It seems against your usual nature.  If you truly want to give it to me, I'll take it.&quot;  She held her hand out after a few moments.<br>
  &quot;What do you mean?&quot;  Millikin dropped the vial into her hand.<br>
  &quot;You are very hostile to me.  As evidenced by this evening.&quot;  Valdayana answered, poking the ranger.<br>
  &quot;You have a talent for bringing out the worst in me at times.&quot;  Millikin bristled.  &quot;And quit poking me.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Then perhaps you should work on your self-control.&quot;  Valdayana admonished.  Millikin glared at the dark elf but bit her tongue to refrain from responding with an insult.  She couldn't refute the validity of the advice, solicited or not.<br>
   &quot;And what would you have done if someone stole something from you?&quot;  Millikin asked.<br>
  &quot;That wouldn't happen.  I'm not careless.&quot;  Valdayana responded immediately.<br>
  &quot;I'm not careless either.&quot;  Millikin snapped.<br>
  &quot;Believe what you want, that's your right.&quot;  Valdayana slipped the vial into a pouch.<br>
  &quot;You hired someone to break into my room and go through my personal belongings.&quot;  Millikin growled.<br>
  &quot;But I asked first, did I not?&quot;<br>
  &quot;And I refused.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Which demonstrates your hostility towards me.&quot;  Valdayana watched in slight amusement as Millikin trembled in barely controlled rage.  The ranger clenched and unclenched her hands into fists a few times before responding.<br>
  &quot;You've given me ample reason not to trust you.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;You're welcome to believe that, if you wish to be paranoid, that's your right.&quot;  Valdayana spoke calmly.<br>
  &quot;I am NOT paranoid.&quot;  Millikin replied angrily then took a deep breath.  &quot;You did steal from me and bragged about the thief being willing to kill me in my sleep but didn't on your word.  I honestly wonder why.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;To see how you would react.  And better understand and predict the emotions of lesser races.&quot;<br>
  &quot;That's why you provoke me?  As an experiment.&quot;  Millikin's hands twitched once again in anger.<br>
  &quot;Well, &quot;  Valdayana paused thoughtfully at the question.  &quot;That and it's fun.  Really though, you should know by now its not malicious.&quot;  As she sat down once more, she poked Millikin in the side, who seemed suddenly lost in thought.  <br>
<br>
     'Not malicious?'  Millikin weighed the statement.  Which was worse - the pursuit of power or materialism?  While Millikin didn't mourn the loss of the medallion piece overmuch, she was disturbed over another aspect of this entire situation.  The enchanter, in her search for power, violated the ranger's privacy and personal sense of security.  While the act itself was committed by someone Millikin trusted to an extent, (even if she did not share her ethics) it did not change the fact that the act was done because Valdayana wished it so.  One thing about money is that there was never a shortage of people willing to take it when offered.  If not Esmalyn then certainly another would have.  That, of course, begged the question of why the luhtmauyar went to the trouble of hiring someone known to Millikin in the first place.  She found herself thinking of the caustic comments Valdayana made about Millikin's family earlier.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You are no closer to understanding me now than the day you first met me.  I do wonder though...&quot;  Millikin's hands burned and she found herself shoving them into her pockets.<br>
  &quot;Wonder what?&quot;  Valdayana inquired without opening her eyes.<br>
  &quot;Your family doesn't like you do they?&quot;  Millikin kneeled down beside her. <br>
  &quot;Aside from Elegy, my family is dead.  Does that answer your question?&quot;<br>
  &quot;That explains a lot.&quot;  Millikin looked at Valdayana intently who merely shrugged.  &quot;I don't know if I should feel sorry for you or wonder if it's the result of your karma.&quot;  Valdayana opened one eye and poked Millikin again.<br>
  &quot;Do not poke me.&quot;  Millikin whispered softly.<br>
  &quot;Then step back a pace maybe.&quot;  <br>
Millikin stood up and took a half step back, still watching her, contemplating.<br>
  &quot;I have studies to attend to, you know.&quot;  <br>
  &quot;What's so secretive that information is kept in books that are enchanted to keep others from reading them?&quot;<br>
  &quot;They aren't enchanted.  You simply can't understand them.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Letters don't move around on the pages of normal books.&quot;  Valdayana didn't respond, nor did Millikin really expect one.  Her thoughts turned to the different things she had experienced (good and bad) or learned in recent months directly or indirectly due to Valdayana's interference.  She pulled her hands out of her pocket as the enchanter stood up to leave.<br>
  &quot;Anyway, in case I never told you, thank you.&quot;  Millikin said quietly.<br>
  &quot;For?&quot;  <br>
  &quot;For what you've given me.  I'm not referring to tangible things though.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Good work, you're learning that knowledge is power.&quot;<br>
Millikin blinked in surprise.  &quot;I think that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Don't get used to it.&quot;  Valdayana poked Millikin once more then walked away, leaving the ranger to her contemplations.<br>
