<br>
I am not fixated on anything, Fkin. Specialization is for insects. His &quot;point of principle&quot; is entirely bogus and fabricated as his daughter was in no way harmed even in the slightest by the Pledge, by her mother's admission. His entire pretense in bringing forth this suit was to protect his daughter from something that we've since seen that she needed no protection from. The ruling is still technically valid, but the case that caused it is not.<br>

Amusing since you have neither proven that the lawsuit was ill conceived, frivolous or any of the other many things you have arbitrarily declared in the past - it appears that the ninth circuit at least doesn't agree with you. Perhaps they are all pinheads as well.

   Seeing how you have already admitted that you are *not* a lawyer I assume the statement above pertaining to the relative merits of the case is as made up as the rest what you say /shrug.

<br>
   The point was, as many other people have said, this is an old topic, and to continue to chortle over the perceived shortcomings of this guy at this point is certainly a reasonable basis for calling you fixated. I personally doubt your own life could stand up to the level of scrutiny this person is enduring so once again you are taking the hypocrites part.<br>

   I suppose that since you cant address what I said about you being fixated on this guy and this topic perhaps calling me 'pinheaded' is a good way to make yourself feel better. Call it empathy welfare for those who have nothing to say. Feel better now?<br>

Perhaps they are all pinheads as well.<br>
<br>
You have not done your research, Slick. The 9th circuit is the single most overturned, overruled, and reverse Federal Circuit in the Nation. They aren't exactly credible.<br>
<br>
As to the suit being frivolous, do the math. While I may not be a lawyer, I deal with torts on a daily basis. There are certain basic elements of a tort that Newdow's suit does not show, thanks to his wife;s revelations.<br>
<br>
The three basic pillars on which a tort is based would be a Legal Duty Owed (here, this would be the Givt's Duty to not establish a State religion), a Breach of that Legal Duty (here, this would be the Govt passing legislation to include a phrase that refers to a God in such a manner as to establish some existance), and, lastly, there must be Actual Damages (here, the mental anguish of Newdow's daughter being forced to posit the existence of God).<br>
<br>
While the Legal Duty and Breach of Legal Duty are present, there are no Actual Damages according to the child's legal guardian.<br>
<br>
By default, this lawsuit is thus frivolous.<br>
<br>
&gt; In addition while it is quite apparent that you do not 'agree whole-heartedly' with this persons position - your repeated propaganda like declarations on the topic - several of which have been sighted as *false* by persons other than myself, speaks considerably more loudly than your assertion here<br>
<br>
Actually, the only person that attempted to asert that anything I'd said was false would be you. Get your facts straight. And, to state again, as you cannot seem to get this fact straight either, I said that I agree with the overall decision and its' grounding in reason. You will not find anywhere that I have said that I agree with Newdow.<br>
<br>
Do stop trying to attach your lack of perspective to my arguments.<br>
<br>
&gt; Furthermore, considering the amount of vilification and outright propaganda being perpetrated by people like yourself about these folks, its not really that surprising that they would say things like this is it? - or is that to difficult for you to comprehend?<br>
<br>
Not in the slightest. While I would not expect you to be bright enough to understand it, I prefaced my comments with a few lines about how I cannot fully confirm what I heard yet. I posted what I did simply because I appreciate the rich irony. While I am aware that you are painfully deficient of a sense of humour and I feel badly for you, please don't assume that everyone else is as challenged. Try reading some Schopenhauer. He writes extensively about humour and irony and does with so dead a tone that even you would not be insulted by inclusion of anything even remotely humourous or ironic.<br>
<br>
&gt; I suppose that since you cant address what I said about you being fixated on this guy and this topic perhaps calling me 'pinheaded' is a good way to make yourself feel better.<br>
<br>
Actually, I asked you if you were less pinheaded, I'd feel much better.<br>
<br>
&gt; Call it empathy welfare for those who have nothing to say. Feel better now?<br>

Except of course the bit about the 9th circuit - while how many times they may or may not have been overturned had *nothing* to do with what I said, I will say that I find them more rational, credible and certainly more educated than yourself. <br>
 You forget as usual Bulvai that the author of this thread and several others presented material that contradicted many of the things you asserted in the past. Much like everything else with you, since it is outside your particular word-view, you pretend it doesn't exist - grats!<br>
 I already told you I wasn't going to waste my time with you. If your ego is as wrapped up in this case and this person as it appears to be, perhaps you should seek help. Though I of course reserve the right to 'snipe' if you continue to be fixated on this subject, I dont see much point replying to you to be honest unless it amuses me.<br>
<br>
 As for Empathy Welfare I didn't lift it, I coined it as far as I know, and it appears that you still need some, since your still making various personal attacks on me. Since you have asserted various things in the past about such attacks in the context of an argument, I can only assume that your simply being hypocritical again.<br>

Where is your logic, Fkin? All you continue to say is &quot;I'm not listening to you, so there&quot;. Where are your posits, your points, your proofs?

If you'd like examples, I can go back and quote page and verse from various posts of ours.<br>

Still, if you cannot refute anything logically and simply need to attack, so be it. Forgive me if I remain unimpressed and continue to point out your lack of logic and argumentative ability. You continue to fail to debate this issue simply because you cannot do so. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

Your general style of argument has been &quot;Quote and Run&quot;. Essentially, you hit a search engine, find some quote that may or may not have anything to do with your point, post it sans notations as to author or source, and then leave it be sans explanation of relation to your argument. You have made little attempt to present your point in any structured fashion, preferring instead to ask your reader to infer your point by presenting and then decrying its' opposite. Your tone is so very negative and contrary that you cannot even admit to the few areas wherein we've agreed.<br>
<br>
The reverse of what you proffer would be the arguments that I have presented to you which have consisted primarily of relatively structured logical discourse and point by point logical proofs. When I have chosen to quote in support of my arguments, the quotes have been directed related, annotated properly as to author and source, and their relation to and place in my discourse is extensively documented. My stance has been exquisitely clear time and again, and does not depend on another point of view to be contrary to.<br>
<br>
So, yes, I am a paragon of logic when compared to you.<br>
<br>
Oh, and as you wrote, &quot;Theres an amusing thought at least&quot;, I'm also funnier =) <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

<br>
Certainly more valid than dumping an anonymous quote and refusing to relate it to your lack of argument.<br>
<br>
Fkin wrote further, &quot;As usual you give yourself more credit than you are due. At least I quoted things to support my arguments, and quoting web sources at least make it easy to read what I am quoting.&quot;<br>
<br>
True, quoting web sources designed for the simple-minded to read and then quote does make for easier reading. I think however, no one would consider my posting of actual hard data from well researched scholarly sources  (case in point being the text on Hinduism) to be a bad idea, unless, of course, they were incapable of understanding all the big words.<br>
<br>
Fkin continued, &quot;I suppose this is a difficult thing to understand for a person who quoted next to nothing in these discussions. (and no 'I heard a report' and such doesn't count.)&quot;<br>
<br>
Silly Fkin. I've said no less than three times that I was not quoting a source. This is more than what you did as it referred to the information as having some vague origination, as opposed to simply placing quotations marks around some line and assuming that your audience will believe you.<br>
<br>
As far as quoting little, well, I'm sorry that your discursive ability is too weak for your logic to stand on its' own. It is a shame that your alumnus' curriculum failed so miserably to prepare you for an argument. Simply quoting someone else's work does not show that you have any ability to reason. It merely shows that you know how to use a search engine.<br>
<br>
Lastly, Fkin admitted, &quot;Either way you are right about one thing - you make me laugh.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm quite glad to read this. I'd hate to think that sheer venom is the only reason that you continue these feeble assaults. My first impression was that you decided to start up again due to the bitterness still welling up inside you. The knowledge that this is done for entertainment purposes soothes my worries as to your emotional condition.  <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

Hardly, I clarified my position since you obviously didn't (and still don't) understand. Again, I cited my sources - you never did, and you admit that. This prooves my contention that you are making up your assertions on the spot - a dubious practice at best. <br>
 I suppose that thats how you got your degree in theo-philosophy or whatever it was, or was it a mail order arrangement? Scholarly indeed. So which is worse? Quoting an accessable source, or making up half-assed definitions when you patently havent got a clue what you are talking about?<br>
 We have been over all this though. The 'web quotes are all for the simple minded' remark is fairly typical of you though. You are a past master of the blanket generalization at this point, and it is truely sad. Considering that a huge percentage of 'scholarly' work is now being published to the internet as well as print I suppose we should just add 'the internet' to the long list of things you havent got clue one about. Perhaps you should consider things on a case by case basis like most rational beings.<br>

&quot;At least I quoted things to support my arguments, and quoting web sources at least make it easy to read what I am quoting&quot;<br>

<br>
Quotes are all well and good... and the best part of quotes is that we can all dig up really neat quotes from most any source, slap them into a post, and use them to make a point, or prove a case.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just not too bright, but I think what Bulvai was trying to get at is that quotes are a dime a dozen, and that you tend to spit out the quotes as if they are the end-all-be-all of the argument.  Rather quotes are simply meant to illustrate your own views and points... of which you've been way less than clear on.<br>
<br>
Bulvai, on the other hand, is quite easy to understand.  Whether or not people agree with his views or not are their own choice, but he's been clear in his presentation, and has backed up his comments and views using his own penned thoughts, rather than throwing out a barrage of other people's quotes (and little to nothing of your own material).  <br>
<br>
While I think your prose is splendid, it's seriously lacking in depth and original thought.<br>
<br>
Maybe if you would take the time to replace all of those quotes with direct thoughts of your own... and give us some substance... maybe... just maybe... you and Bul will come to some agreement (even if it's to agree to disagree), and finally let this thread die.<br>

However, citing a source (as opposed to just quoting someone), builds a foundation for discussion. Making up things on the spot, insisting they are true, and then declaring that anyone who does not agree is 'stupid' is hardly a new trick or original thought.<br>

I think you are still missing the point though.  If you want to debate, then do so.  Fire away.  Present your thoughts... note that I said your's... not anyone else's.<br>
<br>
Your error is that you are using quotes to make a foundation.  In that respect, you are basing your argument on the rhetoric of others, and not yourself.  Try giving us some of your own thoughts.. in your own words... and then use your quotes, not as a foundation, but as a gloss... to add that extra oomph to your side and view.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, all you have is a foundation that isnt even your own... and nothing built upon it.<br>
<br>
While yes, Bul has been taking pot shots (as have you), he's simply stating his own views.  Again, you might not agree with him... but you know what his views are.<br>
<br>
What are your views?  So far, I still cant tell what your views are.  All I see are an assortment of quotes that show what other people think, rather than what you think. <p><center>
