The flag system turns fights into rigid &quot;means to an end,&quot; and that imo sucks.<br>
<br>
Here's what I mean.  Pre-PoP, a guild goes to an encounter X.  Some loot will drop, but only for a few people who are either awarded it or who buy it with long-saved-for points.  So why is rest of guild there?  Well, this is where &quot;roleplaying&quot; in EQ (such as it was) comes in.  The guild gets excited about the fight itself, the challenge of doing it well, etc.<br>
<br>
The flag system fucked with this system.  It turns mobs into means to an end, something you are **already looking past** even the first time you attempt it.  What used to be ends-in-themselves turned into &quot;let's get this done with so we can move forward.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, you can say, &quot;well sadre, so don't think that way about PoP encounters.&quot;  But my point is that verant has *designed* it so that it is *hard* not to think about encounters this way.  They have created an incentive system (flags) that turn encounters more into chores.  To turn them back into pure encounters one is doing strictly for the gameplay fun of it all is to &quot;swim against the current&quot; of what verant has designed into the encounters.<br>
<br>
That's why I think the Teaching of the Zerg Buddha is wise.  Just zerg through the flag process, so that, with ***that*** now out of the way, guilds can go back to playing the game in a more pure way.  Just for the fun of it.<br>
<br>
I remember when wraith/rev was doing ring of vulak.  In my opinion, we were not doing it cause the loots were fabulous or anything like that.  We were doing it strictly to take on a challenge in itself, the fun of the encounter itself.  And we had tons of fun, even though we weren't &quot;progressing&quot; through any flag or key scheme by doing so.  <br>
<br>
This is now what can happen with PoP, now that we have punted away the fucking horrid, lame, offensive flag grail that verant must think we are all shuddering, grunting drones to think we would actually buy into it and smile about it.  <br>
<br>
We are &quot;just saying No&quot; to the flag system.  We are not saying no to trying to play better and to focus on skill combined with fun.  That is my point: we are zerging the flags precisely so we *can* now focus on those things that make eq fun.<br>
<br>
We will be doing rallos &quot;seriously&quot; in the future now, and without the grim downer of flag bs turning raids into festivals of people who are &quot;looking past&quot; the encounter so badly that they can't even enjoy it while it is happening.<br>

Gimick:  If we were left to fight the mobs without fighting other guilds, we'd be even happier.   You are the sole guild that had been in the way of that.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure the flag system was desinged with the idea it would help slow down progress.  It backfired here.  Guild #1 gives its' 2 rivals a hard time... since it's a 3 way battle it makes is easy for Guild #1 to stay on top.. see emperor.  <br>
<br>
Our Emperor and Rallos situation were almost identical.. you guys got him first... and Vis and us had to wait for shots.. you guys were rude pretty often but Vis and us took it because neither of us *wanted* (or due to internal conflict were unable to effectively) fight.  Vis and us were also not on good enough terms to team up.  So we got stuck months at Emp instead of a week.<br>
<br>
Rallos was different.. us and vis (along with the other server guilds) had been sharing flags, allowing each other access to the mobs we wanted/needed without races.. and just having fun.  The game in pop has been more fun than I've ever had it in a fulltime raiding guild.  The stupid shit we used to fight over seems silly.  Everyone benefits when we work together.  So.. we're back to looking at a potentially months-long roadblock that should again take us a matter of a week or two... this time tho, relations are good, and vis and us have no problem teaming up.  It's a good thing we can get 100+ flags a shot, since if we were limited to 72 we just would have teamed up on him 4 or 5 times to get it done.<br>
<br>
As for people mocking us for it.. if you are upset and concerned and all about it....please post... you are pure entertainment to me.  Who cares?  This is a game.  I don't care how well other folks do... it is not a threat to me, in my video game.  Yes, having the time to learn rallos in peace would have been great.  The payoff on Emp was huge... but teaming up with Vis was fun also, and it was more fun than dealing with LC in any fashion over Rallos.  More fun = the way to go.<br>
<br>
I honestly don't think you LC people understand how the rest of the server is playing together...  we aren't helping each other out under protest or waiting for our moment to take over the server or anything.. we just playing, having fun, helping each other out.<br>
<br>
This game is so much better when &quot;rival&quot; guilds share and even encourage/help each other than when they fight and dickmeasure.... <p>Gurunt Bangoo &lt;Wraith&gt;<br>

<br>
Dividing 2 loot items amongst 150 people will get you geared up faster than dividing 2 loot items amongst 60 people? Or even 80 people? Is this the &quot;new math&quot;?<br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;So, to recap: you're getting loot slower than if you were separate,&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
My Question: Are you a loot whore?<br>
<br>
Wraith is not, and we probably have the lowest loot whore consensus on the Quellious Server.<br>
<br>
&quot;you're getting no &quot;props&quot; from other players,&quot;<br>
<br>
Incorrect. We are getting plenty of props if it at matters, those rediculous posts on every other major message board had a overall majority of people either saying, good for you, grats, or who gives a shit. Plenty of VM gave props to Wraith and likewise. We even got some props from some lotus on our webpage! <br>
<br>
&quot;and you're enduring rather than enjoying the stuff you face.&quot;&quot;<br>
<br>
No, teaming with VM was fun, and it was something weve never done to that degree. <br>

I think you need to find something worth flaming about before you come to these boards, talk out of your ass, and make your guild look like even more of a joke. &quot;<br>
<br>
I've known her a bit as well, and her comments make her sound as if she was one, thats all.<br>
Ntin, you are the only joke here, you have nothing to do with Wraith/Rev/VM and LC's issues, you dont play EQ, you critisized uber guilds while you played, now you chose to critisize someone that does critisize uber guilds (Impudent).<br>
You have no friends , you are a follower, your short bus is full of just that, you, and constantly suck the virtual cock of Lotus cult, your nothing more than a nuisance, and a hemroid. I'd go on but you seem to like it when someone proclaims how much of a fucking rediculous loser you are friend.<br>

I read her post doesn't make her sound like a loot whore she has a good point it is lame how the system works now verant ups the risk and doesn't add more reward its a common problem that has been bitched about since sov. <br>
<br>
I don't critisize uber guilds I like alot of them. I couldn't honestly join them cause I don't like all the raiding, I tried once for lc but after a week and half of emp key raids I was sick of it. Again you make a dumbfuck judgement I have alot of friends in the game and out of it. Sounds like me you are just stabbing wildly at something from your self. <br>
<br>
You are right I do like it when people say I suck or loser. It's a little sadistical pleasure I get cause I know I have done something to piss you off or get under your skin and you if reply to this saying I don't get under your skin your full of shit because some one doesn't write a reply like this for no reason.<br>
<br>
Sucking the virtual cock as you put it of lotus cult.

You should look at the rosters of all four guilds and make that calculation again.......LC has maybe 20-30 full-time raiders, the rest is made up of part-timers who can play when they can (some more, some less). <br>
