I was the one who dragged grim's corpse.   Do you know what exactly happened to grim?  Our group were hunting in RC, YES..RIGHT CORNER!!!  You know where that is, right? That's like AT THE ZONE IN.  That's like NO WHERE NEAR THE CASTLE.  Grim was pulling spiders (he wasnt even close to safehall!) and he suddenly got summoned to god know where (does this sound like he got trained to you?).  As as scaried little troll, he tried to run-but he didnt know where he was, he tried to FD-and you know how good SK FD is. Then he died...and got accused of training... He didnt even know where happened, took me like 15 mins to found his corpse--and we didnt know how to get back out to zone from there, ask Vorkun (grim even fell down to LD when we were trying to look for way out.  I had to run down to gate him out, there was a LD group there who can prove this).  Why shall we apologize for something we didnt do?  You have no clue where VM was hunting.  You see VM tag in zone, You see VM corpse near you, You get trained, and you assume it's VM's train and you demand an apology.  When there is no apology from VM, VM is evil.  Thanks Logic.  <br>

If you bothered reading the entirety of my post before assuming someone was guild bashing you just because you were VM, you would have realized that I even mentioned a comment along the lines of &quot;pathing is really screwed up, sucks you guys got caught up in that&quot; being sufficient in dealing with the situation.  My point was that rather than telling us what happened you completely ignored any comments about the train and didn't even bother to offer up an explanation as to what happened.  But you have this idea that you're a member of the &quot;oh so hated VM&quot; and everyone is against you.  Rather than taking my post for what it was.... a simple plea for some kind of courtesy/communication in the midst of a situation that got some of my friends killed, you decided to cry &quot;guild bashing&quot;.  Maybe if you weren't so stereotypical and ignorant in how you think everyone views you, you wouldn't have completely missed the point of my post.  Thanx reading comprehension.<br>
<br>

<br>
Add edit....<br>
I even pointed out that it was probably pathing/stupid eq bug that caused the train and it WAS Grimblades' getting summoned and running (by some Verant display of genius) that caused the castle mobs to move.  You accuse me of assuming it was VM's train just because I see VM in the zone and a VM members corpse being dragged through our camp, but you made it very obvious in your post that Grim was summoned and ran and died and the timing of that was HIGHLY coincidental to the subsequent train on UD.  So cheers for trying to make me out to be some sort of VM hater despite never having made any derogatory comments about VM in guild chat or on these boards ever.  Oh but I must be a VM hater because I assumed it was their train when you admit in your own post that these so called assumptions I've made are 100% correct.  /cheer your own logic thanx.  <br>
<br>
The thing I do apologize for is assuming you were fighting in the castle and thinking the train was a direct result of that...... I just thought a group from a guild of your caliber was a lot more likely to be fighting there than in some place like RC and in the future I wont make an assumption based on the amount of respect I have for the skill level of the members of your guild. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A> at: 11/5/01 1:10:50 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwhytspirit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whytspirit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Buffin' Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/5/01 2:21:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My two cents...</span><hr size=1> I wasn't going to stick my nose in this, but has it escaped anyones notice, that the VM bashing comment was done by Astalus, and sounds pretty sarcastic in the first part of his reply?

I was still a little carried away from the /occ that night.  It was totally unfair to grim and VM.  And some comments here doesnt help at all.   To make it clear, Grim didn't start the train--he got trained.  He didn't train you on purpose, I dont think he even know he trained someone.  If his big troll ass did accidently trained you guys, i apologize for him.<br>

Playing a twink with a pick up group, i dont think we have much choice on where to camp.  If we have a VM group, i doubted you will see us in Velk at all.  It's an easy zone with no skill required.

Sorry Gael somehow i got the idea you were flamming those ppl who dont really deserve flamming. I still think you're a dick but you're no Mohogany nor a Mohogany 2.0 (we all know who that is).<br>

As for Vis. As a whole i dont know em. Ive met some very nice ppl and for sure ive HATED some of their members (Mohogany, Juzzam) but hey i hate lotsa people. Especially the people responsible for Old Navy commercials. <p>     Ravenark <BR>

Your tag is your association. And yes, a few bad apples will spoil the entire uuuh.... barrel? Bucket? I have had rough issues with people in VM. Want me to name 5 I know, and call friends? I can. Want me to name 5 I think are total assholes? I can too. Want me to name 5 more I would kill in a train repeatedly? I can. Want me to name 5 I would walk naked from Queynos to TOV to rez? I can. What would I have proved, other than there are good people and arrogant jerks in VM.<br>
<br>
Big @#%$ deal. So some are assholes. Don't get a rez from someone because they say yer vis? Ask em why. Explain to them you're not Moho, or Occy, or whoever pissed them off! Or, if you're so badass that you dont *need* them, call your uber_cleric05 to sebilis.<br>
<br>
My opinion? Move Vis to another server. I know sure as hell I'd leave Quellious if the playermove allowed to any server (euro server don't count, heh, i play odd enough hours as is!). <br>
<br>
So what am I saying? Perhaps Vis Maior has both good people, and freaks. It takes a lot to be that good at EQ. Perhaps at the cost of their social life. It's something they WANT to succeed at. I was that way a while, during school breaks. I WANTED the best. I wanted respect. But I NEVER stomped toes. Some people will do anything. I know of many occasions (over 20) that Wraith Vs. Vis Maior was a major battle over a spawn, or an issue. I don't care anymore. But ya know what? I will remember those who trashed me. My guild? Yea we had assholes too, I fully admit. And if I get blasted for being ex-wraith, so be it. Thus, I try to avoid guilds with problematic people.<br>
<br>
Woow tends to speak his mind, clearly and concisely. I respect that. Very inflammatory, but @#%$, it's a flame board! I think Woow needs to just beat the @#%$ outta someone in RL, and he'll calm down <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Nitrouz, I have had issues with Vis as well. I now avoid the forementioned players like the plague. I suggest you do the same, and ignore the tag issue. Trust me.<br>
<br>
Gaelron, You just got misunderstood, no biggie. Shrug it off, and take a few days from the board. Let peeps post a bunch of @#%$, and laugh at how this post became a thread about hog dog meat origins....<br>
<br>
Ffat, dude, who @#%$ cares who likes who? This aint high school, although a large player base is. Thus, the Fierona Vie server was made. I truely admire the thought behind it, and I'd move there in a heartbeat. Just to avoid the loot @#%$ and whoring that occurs on Quell. Not vis, just in general. Too many people loggin on, KSing spawns, etc. @#%$ em all. Just play to enjoy yourself, yer getting caught up in the nuances...<br>
<br>
Ravenark, you're right. I need more naked chicks in my life. (Ok, well, if my gf sees this, i'm @#%$ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
To the ladies from &lt;Far Daries Mai&gt;, omg. Sig heaven. Thank you!!!! *hugs*<br>
<br>
Rest of ya, I have an IDEA!!!!<br>
<br>
We should make ALL flame threads be in Haiku format. Damn, that'd be cool. And not just any moron could post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
