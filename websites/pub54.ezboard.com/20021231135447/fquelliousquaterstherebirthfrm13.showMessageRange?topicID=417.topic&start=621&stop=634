<br>
No, but a lot of nerfs were the result of complaints.<br>
<br>
&quot;Neither is it Verant's job to make it easy for me, or as easy as it is for the next class. It's your shortcoming.&quot;<br>
<br>
Truly spoken like someone playing a class that enjoys a large chunk of the game revolving around them without any real drawbacks to playing it.  It is Verant's job to make the game balanced and fun.  Quite frankly it isn't fun when a raid doesn't take place because there isn't enough warriors, clerics, rogues, a shaman, and an enchanter present.  Nor is it balanced when a class with very efficient soloing ability, high desirability for XP groups, and raids, while other classes don't have any such appeal in any category and have the one thing they excel in given to a generalist class that already excels in multiple areas.  <br>
<br>
I know you (as well as a large portion of the rogue community) would have a lot of profane things to say about Verant if they opted to give bards the backstab ability because they feel that the bard's class DPS is lagging too far behind other melee classes.  <br>
<br>
&quot;you have complained about the hardships of finding groups&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't go looking for groups anymore and stopped grouping for experience unless it was with friends several months ago.  Once a blue moon I managed to get a group that would disperse within an hour but more often than not, it was a waste of my time night after night and listening to the inevitable drivel about the ranger class that followed and the unsolicited sexually explicit comments sent to me in tells.  I sure as hell don't miss the soloing XP grind and wouldn't envy any class forced into that role especially when they made their class initially knowing they would be needed for groups.  It's like being the victim of a bait and switch scam.<br>
<br>
Unlike you, I don't go around discounting claims of the difficulties other classes have with getting a group.  Because I've experienced and/or seen it myself, dabbled in playing the class already and know what its like, or have a friend who plays or played the class as a primary.  You call it whining, but have yet to offer a shred of proof to refute that it's typically the same few classes that spend hours on end looking for group in most post 50 zones and often end up leaving to play alts.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;let's pick my rangah, currently up to 45. Can't complain about picking up groups that were not my friends when I wanted and solo'd when I wanted....  And since you haven't ruled out epics I'll assume it's okay to start with them at 50. &quot;<br>
<br>
It's a pretty arrogant presumption to assume you'll have both your epics at 50.  You planning on not leveling past 50 until you have them and soloing all the mobs yourself or is someone else holding all the pieces for you?  And no, your soloing toy/mobile radar unit doesn't count.  Rangers don't qualify in the category of being unwanted in groups AND lacking the ability to solo.  Of course the ability to solo viably only came about by what you term as whining, though your ranger alt enjoys the benefits of it -- from Panic Animal to Spirit of the Wolf.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe dying to the Chancellor a few times prior to getting my epic along with /counterattack was a figment of my imagination. Along with my total dependency on a partner/group that continues to this day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Speaking of whining... (Oh yeah, it's coming from a rogue so it's a legitimate complaint about being underpowered.  Not.)   Cut the crap about rogues being totally group dependant and unable to solo, I see more than a few rogues soloing quite well at all levels and they are not all decked out in fungi tunics and wielding some post epic weapons.  Whereas, it was uncommon before Luclin came out, it is noticeably more prevalent now.  And it's going to be even more commonplace with the plethora of right click heal breastplates, Bloodpoints selling for under 1k and the ability to make lifedraw proc weapons out.  But if you're really so desperate to solo why did you make a rogue in the first place?  <br>
<br>
&quot;Some classes will forever remain vital in many situations and will be subsequently--the horror!--chosen over others.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yep.  It doesn't even have to be a &quot;raid&quot; situation.  People are going to be picky about who and what they want in their group and no amount of skill at playing your class, in depth knowledge of the zone, mob pathing and agro range, or witty commentary is going to get you a spot.  Why are you trying to push the concept that advertising your class is going to change anyone's perceptions?  <br>

<br>
Well, since I only play one of the five classes you named capable of raiding I have been in situations where there were not enough healers or slowers and we had to call it a night while we waited around hoping for someone to show up. You know what I say to that? Boo fucking hoo. I'll just have to wait for another chance, but I won't use the occasion to carp at Verant for being unable or unwilling to place all classes on the same bar as far as desirability/necessity for raids/XP.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know you (as well as a large portion of the rogue community) would have a lot of profane things to say about Verant if they opted to give bards the backstab ability because they feel that the bard's class DPS is lagging too far behind other melee classes.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bards are now capable of sneaking like rogues. I was surprised when I found out about it but didn't take it as a sign that Armageddon was right around the corner. The only thing I would raise hell about is a melee outdamaging me under any circumstance. That would pretty much eclipse the rogue role. But since you know me as well as you think you do, what you say must be so. =P<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't go looking for groups anymore and stopped grouping for experience unless it was with friends several months ago.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good for you. Now if you could just strip months of angry /tells from my memory that'd be great.<br>
<br>
&quot;Once a blue moon I managed to get a group that would disperse within an hour but more often than not...&quot;<br>
<br>
Why do you think these circumstances apply only to you and are special enough to make mention here? It's happened to me and every player at least once. Regardless of gear, guild, and class.<br>
<br>
&quot;...it was a waste of my time night after night and listening to the inevitable drivel about the ranger class that followed..&quot;<br>
<br>
Sticks and stones...<br>
<br>
&quot;Unlike you, I don't go around discounting claims of the difficulties other classes have with getting a group... You call it whining, but have yet to offer a shred of proof to refute that it's typically the same few classes that spend hours on end looking for group in most post 50 zones and often end up leaving to play alts.&quot;<br>
<br>
So when I turn to an alt because Es is LFG in ME or wherever do I get to whine? I haven't discounted anything. I've been trying to say that it's up to the player to pick up where Verant left off. You -really- underestimate human relations and don't want to hold that accountable as far as successes go, regardless of class played, in the least.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's a pretty arrogant presumption to assume you'll have both your epics at 50. You planning on not leveling past 50 until you have them and soloing all the mobs yourself or is someone else holding all the pieces for you?&quot;<br>
<br>
Aside from two foraged items I don't have anything on her epic. I don't think it's arrogant for anyone to shoot for an epic at 50. Maybe crazy, but not arrogant. Sorry if I don't lower my expectations to appease the world and come off as something other than meek.<br>
<br>
&quot;And no, your soloing toy/mobile radar unit doesn't count. Rangers don't qualify in the category of being unwanted in groups AND lacking the ability to solo.&quot;<br>
<br>
I thought it'd be a little poetic to take the bid with Sil seeing as you swore up and down that rangers were the least wanted class in groups/raids for a very long time. Not only that, but you can pretty much kiss your solo'ing days goodbye post 50 without Earthcaller unless you want to spend all your time in WW.<br>
<br>
&quot;Speaking of whining... (Oh yeah, it's coming from a rogue so it's a legitimate complaint about being underpowered. Not.)&quot;<br>
<br>
I wasn't whining. I like grouping. Having my character, a pixilated Fembot get hit on and other various moments that made me roll my eyes never wounded my sensibilities so deeply that I gave up on groups. And in this game, giving up on groups is as good as giving up on people and having fun.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cut the crap about rogues being totally group dependant and unable to solo.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is true for Es. Didn't you write: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  I'm sick of being called overpowered because some Super Ranger from Afterlife or Fires of Heaven can unload arrows of death into some computer generated monster most people playing this game will only see on website screen shots</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->? You don't want your class to be defined based on the achievements of the top 1% yet you presume I speak for all rogues?<br>
<br>
&quot;People are going to be picky about who and what they want in their group and no amount of skill at playing your class, in depth knowledge of the zone, mob pathing and agro range, or witty commentary is going to get you a spot.&quot;<br>
<br>
And I suppose somehow that gives me the right to blame player habits and perceptions, no matter how skewed, their discriminating process and the dishes they left in the sink on Verant. Quit making VI responsible for everything. I thought you of all people would be in favor of holding others accountable for being jerks.<br>
<br>

<br>
Of most of the other garbage you spewed that I won't even dignify with a response because it's been purposely twisted out of context, flat out ignorant, and/or irrelevant personal attacks, this statement takes the cake for sheer stupidity on your part.  You've proven my point that people will not readily change their perceptions regardless of what is staring them in the face.<br>
<br>
Did it escape your attention in the past eight months since I'd been wielding Swiftwind that I was well over level 50? (Level 55 when I received it.)  And since I know you look for any reason to harp about my use of /roleplay, I'll just kill that and give you a Captain Obvious clue.  Red con at 51 means the subject being considered is at least level 54.  <br>
Earthcaller only came into my possession about a month after I hit level 60.  Yet somehow I managed to solo well enough without it and it didn't involve using the Panic Animal spell in Western Wastes.<br>
<br>
&quot;The only thing I would raise hell about is a melee outdamaging me under any circumstance. That would pretty much eclipse the rogue role.&quot;<br>
<br>
But it is perfectly acceptable to you for paladins and shadowknights to outdo warriors in tanking situationally, which is a warrior's defined role.  Ah, the smell of hypocrisy.  While your ignorance is bliss I can't resist stating this.  <br>
<br>
Holy Forge + Slay Undead + Divine Might &gt; Rogue Backstab on undead mobs.<br>
<br>
Go Paladins!<br>
<br>
&quot;Having my character, a pixilated Fembot get hit on and other various moments that made me roll my eyes never wounded my sensibilities so deeply that I gave up on groups.&quot;<br>
<br>
1.  An example here of you purposely twisting what I said out of context, I never said I gave up on groups, I said I quit wasting my time looking for them.<br>
2.  When did Looking for Group suddenly mean Looking for Cyber?<br>
While you may enjoy it when some skeeze whom you don't know starts talking smut to you, I personally don't care for it.  And after said person ignores my non-response and continues to the point where I say &quot;Leave me alone, I'm not interested.&quot;  I do NOT mean &quot;Maybe.&quot;  And if you or any other scumbag thinks I should have to sit there and allow myself to be harassed on the grounds that 'it's just a game' you can go straight to hell.  End of discussion.<br>
<br>
And just to save you the trouble of taking the time to try and come up with some more irrelevant ad hominem attacks on me, I won't waste any further time responding to anything else you have to say on this thread because you completely trashed your credibility on this subject and you've proven beyond a shadow of a doubt your complete ignorance of the difficulties other classes experience trying to level post 50.<br>

<br>
Es has quite a few valid points, and you just totally ignore all of them instead of stating any facts against them.<br>
<br>
But rangers and grouping isn't what this thread is about anyway, I don't know how we got here.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I can solo..... one mob every 5 minutes. Ranger in equal gear? One mob every 1-2 minutes. <br>
<br>
/shrug. Considering that, grouping is ALOT more efficient for a Rogue... but I hate grouping. Half the people you meet are, well, not that bright. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I'd only consider grouping with friends or people I KNOW are good.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I've seen Paladin's outdamage me on Undead mobs.... which is perfectly fine. Paladin's, according to GENERAL roleplaying AND Verant, are all superior when destroying undead. The skill is perfectly balanced in my opinion, considering how rare undead ubermobs are, heh.<br>
<br>
And for crying out loud, can guys play guy characters please. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

What else does a Rogue do traditionally? Everything you could think of would never be used on a raid. I pick maybe 1-2 locks on a raid per week. Only use disarm traps in 2 different zones period.<br>
