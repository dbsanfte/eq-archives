Furthermore the mother has absolutely no proof at all that EQ had anything to do with her son's suicide. She may have facts that show he used EQ as an escape from his RL, but he could have chosen any other escape had EQ not been available. Books, TV, drugs etc. The fact that he needed an escape, points to RL as his problem more than EQ. <br><br>But without any  communication from the person, who can ever say for sure WHY they kill themselves. With out that it's all guess work. <br><br>Suicide is always a tradjedy for those of us left behind. Mom's attempt to find a place to lay the blame is understandable, but I suspect she will be laughed out of court over this one... <p><img src="http://www.home.earthlink.net/~jewellzz/_uimages/DENSIG.jpg"border="0"></a> <BR><i>Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take,<BR> but by the moments that take our breath away. </i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uaidiene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidiene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hot woodelf</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/9/02 11:37:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=275.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shawn Woolley's mother is an idiot, I'm sorry...</span><hr size=1> People sue Colt when someone they love is shot with a weapon Colt manufactures...it's the same logic.

Without the quick take down of Guy, he could have killed those hostages with his own Colt .45.<br><br><br>Sometimes people are having trouble in real life, I've known a few of these people.  They use EQ as an escape to get away from real life abuse, neglect, peer presure, whatever.  They log in when they get home from a day at school getting picked on, etc to talk to their friends, to have a good time - sometimes the only reason (and this isn't a good thing IMO) these people have to trudge thru the day at work/school is the simple fact that they know they will have real friends to turn to when they get home.<br><br>I think the &quot;Parker&quot; guy from the article was very wrong when he stated that:<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>&quot;The social component is big because it gives players a false sense of relationships and identity,&quot; Parker said. &quot;They say they have friends, but they don't know their names.&quot;<br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>Everquest relationships are very real, even if the identity is false.  I could compare this to talking on the telephone - is a telephone friendship you have with an inmate in the federal prison &quot;false&quot;?  Of course not, you know that person is there on the other end and you talk to them every day.  How is it different from EverQuest?  Its not.<br><br>Maybe he says EQ relationships are false because he doesn't think they last forever?  And in most cases, they dont last forever, but neither do real life relationships.  Think about it, over the course of your life you, or at least most people, keep close to their parents -and MAYBE 1 or 2 lifelong friends they've known since gradeschool.  Everybody else they simply meet along the way, get to know, spend 2-10 years of their life with then things start to shy away.<br><br>It kinda brings a tear to my eye when I think back to all the people I use to know, all the friends I've had - and now have forgotten (but never REALLY).  Hell, I remember swinging on the swingset in school with, at that time, my best pal.  I wish we woulda kept in contact.<br><br>But I digress, I'll stop swaying away from the topic.  The point is, you log on to EQ to talk to your friends, they talk back and you know they are real.  Who cares if its really the opposite sex on the other end?  Or who cares if they are really a 46 year old mother of 2 who in your era (assuming the subject of my ramblings is, a GenX kid) is considered &quot;old&quot; but who you in EQ think is the coolest person.<br><br>I guess it all comes down to not knowing all the facts.  I challenge this &quot;Parker&quot; guy from the news article to play EQ himself for 2 1/2 to 3 years like I have, then tell me if all these friendships I have in EQ are &quot;false&quot;.<br><br><br>I dunno, maybe nothing I'm saying makes sense.

A friend of mine killed himself.  His mother at the wake(whatever it was called) blamed the whole thing on D&amp;D but yet failed to mention anything about her husband beating her, her drinking and drug problems, the emotional abuse my friend took from his parents and sister and to top it off his girlfriend broke up with him just prior.  First attempt at death he failed and was admitted for the mandatory 72 hours (nurses were on strike and just let him go cause was &quot;deemed safe&quot;) and the next day he finished his plan.<br><br>Siting there listening to her BS was so painful.  I wanted to stand up and tell the bitch to STFU and tell her EXACTLY why he did what he did.<br><br>I can understand needing something othe than yourself to blame cause Shawn's mom probably knows deep down it was her neglegance that her son is gone.  NOTHING could have been done to prevent Shawn from killing himself short of locking him up. GET OVER IT Mrs WOOLLEY.<br><br>I myself am addicted to EQ and play extensive hours and yet I am a &quot;normal&quot; functioning individual with no problems short of lack of outside RL stimulation.  Most of us use EQ or another gaming ideal to escape and do things we could not do in RL.  If you find a dragon in RL and manage to slay him CRAP HOOK ME UP. Not knowing a EQ player's real name is of no consequence and does not faze me in the least.  Not knowing does not mean they are not my friend.  <br><br>BABBLE BABBLE BABBLE...time to STFU myself<br><br>Gaidal Cain 55th level Paladin <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucolach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Colach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/9/02 3:16:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=275.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shawn Woolley's mother is an idiot, I'm sorry...</span><hr size=1> people are people whether or not they are on eq or in rl and it's the people you know.  <br><br>yah the fact that the kid was using eq as a escape evinces clearly that his problem was not eq. <p><a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13808">Colach Dakai</a><br>Grandmaster<br><a href = "http://www.lotuscult.com">Lotus Cult</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uafropyrm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>afroPyrm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/9/02 10:22:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=275.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shawn Woolley's mother is an idiot, I'm sorry...</span><hr size=1> Montague:<br>&quot; Everybody else they simply meet along the way, get to know, spend 2-10 years of their life with then things start to shy away.&quot;<br><br>Wise words, my man.

This may come off a bit raw, but as messed up as this situation sounds, EQ may have actually helped to keep this kid alive for as long as he was. <br><br>When a family loses a child to suicide, the question that runs rampant in their minds is &quot;Why&quot;. This mom is trying to answer that question, and has locked in on EQ as the answer. It's somewhat typical, even if there isn't an obvious reason, the families will &quot;trick&quot; themselves into believing they have found out what it is that caused the loss....<br><br>It's understandable, no one wants to go to bed with the weight of their own child's death on their shoulders.<br><br>I know this firsthand. One of my closest friends killed himself when we were 18. Did he have problems, yes. Does anyone really know why? Nope, several of us talked to him that day, some people only minutes before the time of death.  Talking with his parents, they were unsure. Even though it was years ago, I still really don't know...and neither does anyone else.  However, within 24 hours of his death the local newspaper knew though-it was drugs.

Your wife or hubby glares at you because you can't do something together...cause OMG you have a raid!!  How many meals have you taken at the comp or worse yet, skipped?  How many of you have laid out of work or school because you played too late.  You kiddies, how many of you have missed assignments and let your grades drop?
