I even logged my wizard on and jumped into fear to watch first hand if you got him.  Unfortunately, CT got the better of you and your right, the last person hadn't even fallen yet and GS had VM zoning in to take over.  In a way i guess they were right, you guys had been in there for a long time, and they gave you plenty of time to try, but i also know how taxing a raid like CT is on people who arent used to these types of raids.  It takes forever to get people to do what they are supposed to do.<br><br>We in wraith talked about going for Cazic, and came to the conclusion that we would not make any advancements toward fear untill you guys were out of the zone or had given up, afterall there were tons of things up yesterday besides CT.  I was very happy with the decision to leave CT alone till you guys were completely done with him.  We could have probably set up shop right outside fear and waited there to be the next ones in but we didnt.  <br><br>I like to see the smaller guilds go after bigger things, and its even better when they win!  I wish you guys would have gotten another chance, but allas it doesnt work that way usually.  <br><br>Being uber these days, or from at least what i notice, is all about being fast and efficient.  If you guys woulda been able to engage earlier in the evening, maybe you might have gotten a second or third try.  When i heard you guys were going to engage Cazic it was around 8pm.  I know you guys didnt make the first attempt till around 1am.  By that time people were barking at your heals.<br><br>Technically right, ya VM was technically right in taking over after you guys failed once.  Morally right, no not at all...The way i think it should work is the uber's should push each other around.  For instance if Wraith was in fear and f'd up on CT, VM or LC or whatever SHOULD be in there and kill him after our wipe.  But i hate to see the little guys ran over like that, because to them it is a learning experience, and the way things are killed on this server, most mid level guilds have no way to ever practice or try on these types of mobs.<br><br>I would suggest, if Gray Soldiers wants to test out some upper end mob tactics, try Derakor the Vindicator.  He is an 8hr spawn and is a challenge.  IMO that is a good stepping stone to learn on and measure your ability to try other mobs.<br><br>Anyway, these are my own personal views.  I dont call the shots for wraith, and who knows maybe we woulda been in there if VM hadn't of beat us to it.  Personaly, i woulda thought it was wrong if any uber guild, even us, rushed you guys out of fear last night.<br><br>Denia/Dolf<br>Wraith<br><br> <p><a target="new"href="http://www.wraithguild.com">Wraith</a><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=134663">Denia's Stuff</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwooweewoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wooweewoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/4/02 1:02:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=452.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some Uber Guilds</span><hr size=1> last i heard was that VM was asked to go help in fear.  but i didnt go, so i dont know for sure.  might have been a mis-communication.  i just know for a fact that VM hasnt even bother with Ntov for a long time, i doubted we would fight with another guild for CT.  =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ukalliasylurian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kallia Sylurian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/lig/g/r/greenvix/Thingie.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/4/02 1:04:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=452.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/lig/g/r/greenvix/bookfaerymini.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some Uber Guilds</span><hr size=1> She did say that had to clear the zone first.

If it is a top tier guild like VM, Wraith, Lotus Cult or the new ones like Rel and Explicit, Yes im all for it.

Taking over on smaller up and coming guilds, i dont agree with regardless if it is Wraith doing it or anyone.

We can agree it's not okay to do that, or that it's fair game.  We can think as poorly as we want of each others tags... but we (the guilds.. I wasn't in ssra and you weren't in fear or cazic) both done it.<br><br><br>Some of us would rather end that kind of behaviour, some of us would rather escalate it.   <br><br><br>Some of us also play the game for fun.  (talk to Reaggane she has a completely different view of this game than you do... I guess opposites attract)   I don't judge ppl by how &quot;uber&quot; they are, or how few ppl they choose to kill a mob with.   I don't like the spawn fighting, I don't proclaim wraith saints but we don't do anything ppl haven't been doing to us.   We haven't done anything to any guild that hasn't been done to us... that doesn't make it *right*... but it makes those that cheer and insult us and laugh when we take it on the chin quietly  look like assholes when they come here and flame away when we do it back.   I'm very happy we're working with the other &quot;big two&quot; more or less now, rather than competing heads up.<br><br><br>BTW harbo, if the biggest guild you ever were a part of before riding the vis-veterans coattails couldn't manage to get 2 ST keys... I wouldn't puff your chest out too hard and come down so harshly on folks about how un-uber they may or may not be.<br> <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith><br><a href =  "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=283979 "> My Stuff </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ukeenebrightblades.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keene Brightblades</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/5/02 4:50:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=452.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some Uber Guilds</span><hr size=1> Psycra, you rock.<br><br> <p><html><address><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13689"><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">Keene Brightblades</font></a></b></address><address><i><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">60th Season Warder of Tunare</font></i></address><address><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=128238"><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">Sahazar</font></a></b></address><address><i><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">60th Circle Phantasmist</font></i></address><address><i><font face="Tahoma" color="#000080">Gray Soldiers</font></i></address><address><font color="#000080"><i><font face="Tahoma">Quellious</font></i></font></address><address><font color="#000080"><b><font face="Tahoma"><i><marquee>Never EVER Panic!!!</marquee></i></font></b></font></address> </html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwarlordette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warlordette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/5/02 4:57:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=452.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some Uber Guilds</span><hr size=1> Well that explains alot then =) .<br><br>Looks like it was a win win situation.

When we first got there I thought that there was a problem with CT trying to be ks-ed, but vis was nice and let us clear the golems and the rest of fear without even being in the zone.  Then, we engaged Cazic Thule, and although we didn't succeed, it was a hell of a fight.  It was a lot of fun and we all learned a lot about ct for next time.  After we failed, Resa had already rezzed us all before our corpses had been sitting there for 2 minutes.  Seeing as how we didn't have enough tanks and clerics for the fight, we couldn't give it another attempt and then vis went in.  I've had mobs taken by uber guilds before, however vis was really nice in fear this time and imo didn't take anything. <p><p><font size="2"><b><font color="#FF1100">Fendien Elliminster<BR>Evoker of the 59th Rune</font><BR><font color="#9000"><b>Master of the Arcane</font></b><BR><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=42118">Look at my equipment</a></p></b><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~mscott1/Fendien.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=452.topic&start=21&stop=21>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=452.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=452.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=452.topic&index=20><img src=http://xtctripp101.homestead.com/files/qc/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=452.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=452.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=452.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=452.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
