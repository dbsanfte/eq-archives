<br>
I was not on that raid that you are referring to.  I am sure logs can be presented as evidence.  But if I ever am on a riad where we are or have leapfrogged you, plz send me a tell and, as I said, I will give our officers hell because I don't play like that.  <br>
<br>
And maybe I should say, leapfrogging a place-holding grp is not the same as leapfrogging a raid.  A raid is full-force, ready to kill assembly.  A place-holding grp is something a lame guild does to try to make up for the simple fact they don't got the numbers or mobility to strike fast.<br>
<br>
And, woowhatever, are you saying you are messing with us because of that raid oh so long ago?  When was that?  June?  July?  Do you actually enjoy playing EQ as if it were some sort of pro-wrestling grudge-match?  If so, you really need to take those WWF posters down off your wall (ask for mom's help tho, thumbtacks can be sharp, and you should always ask for mom or dad's permission before changing anything in your room!!)<br>
<br>
And gimilly, pudding for brains, I made that comparison because I *have* perspective.  Here is your vocabulary lesson: something can be compared to something, without being equivalent to it.  Sociopathic behavior is a huge category, and I mentioned terrorism to indicate how serious I think such behavior is.  Whenever a person or group treats another person or group without respect for their rights and happiness, that is sociopathic.<br>
<br>
I've already promised: I will never be part of a raid that leapfrogs or tries to otherwise thwart a superior or equal force that is clearly in gear for an encounter.  I will also promise, I will not allow 4 month old grudges determine how I play the game now.  Be nice if you explicit people could utter the same pledge.<br>
<br>
The sad fact is, explicit seems to be saying that in order to show people they &quot;mean business&quot; or are a &quot;serious guild,&quot; they need to employ just these same tactics.  They need to leapfrog to be taken seriously.  They need to try to place-hold mobs they do not have forces for in order to &quot;play tough.&quot;  They need to play for the sake of grudges in order to &quot;show people we mean to be a force.&quot;<br>
<br>
They have fundamentally misunderstood the basic good sportsmanship that holds on quellious.<br>
<br>
I would hate to play a round of golf with explicit.  They would say I was taking to long to tee off, and jump in front of me and quickly whack a shot that goes into the rough, then they would run ahead to try to whack their ball out of the rough before I can walk down the fairway, then they would send their caddies to race me to the green so they can block my put.  Then they would claim they &quot;won&quot; because they got in the hole first.<br>
<br>
It's time to stop playing grudge-matches explicit.  You are the only ones doing it at the high end these days, and just like many of you did way way back, you are stinking up the server.<br>

<br>
From what I have read this is in essence exactly what W/R is doing.  They are just saying that Explicit doesn't have enough people so therefore it's okay for them to play through.  <br>
<br>
The fact that you think anything that ever happens in the game of Everquest is anywhere even remotely serious as a terrorist act PROVES you haven't got one fucking iota of perspective.  <br>
<br>
Actually here is your vocabulary lesson for the day.  A Sociopath is simply someone who is either unable or unwilling to behave in a way that is acceptable to society.  Now in essence you could say that what BOTH guilds have been doing is sociopathic, but that still gives no credence to your comparison of this behavior to that of terrorists that kill thousands of people or someone that eats his victims.  Your mind is pretty fucking warped if you actually think your analogy is anywhere near in perspective.<br>
<br>
Here is one more vocabulary lesson for you.<br>
<br>
Perspective:  the capacity to view things in their true relations or relative importance <br>
<br>
This is what you lack.<br>

Or we should have just moved out of your way since you have more ppl than us? Any more thing to say to bash us?<br>
<br>
&quot;They need to leapfrog to be taken seriously. &quot;<br>
Sadly, yes...that's how it end up due to your F-ed up leadership.  If we didn't leapfrog you guys, will we draw so much attentions?  VM/LC take use seriously, maybe some words exchange..but at least we respect each other in public. Wraith? nah..just ignore and insult us.<br>
<br>
Warlordette, so....i gave you some numbers... We killed AOW with 40s yesterday, that's what kind of *force* we have--small but get things done.  now..honestly, you still think we didnt have enough?  and one last time...WE DIDNT KILL TM with a group to camp cursed.  VM killed TM for bags and we were waiting for repop when wraith poke in. You guys should know better coz you were doing creator at that time.  Why dont you just admit you guys made a mistake?<br>

Ok...back to first grade.  Two wrongs dont make a right.  Thank you.  Just because someone did something to you doesnt mean you have a right to do it back.  If you do, youre just as bad as they are.<br>
<br>
As to having 8 extra keys, yes it DOES make a difference in VT.  40 keys isnt quite enough to raid.  You wont have quite the class balance you need to kill some of the bosses, and then taking into account that not all keys may be online at the time.  8 extra keys makes just enough to field a decent raid force in VT  So yes, 8 keys does make a differece.  But then only people who have BEEN to VT would understand this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usadrespinegnawer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sadre Spinegnawer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Bok Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/18/02 5:10:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=112>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTB planar rifts</span><hr size=1> Gimily said: &quot; The fact that you think anything that ever happens in the game of Everquest is anywhere even remotely serious as a terrorist act PROVES you haven't got one fucking iota of perspective.&quot;<br>
<br>
Gimily, I am maybe a cold-minded person, but I am rational.  This is a simple philosophical debate we are having.  Let me clear you up, and then we can debate.  <br>
<br>
I view everything on a continuum.  I take how I brush my teeth &quot;seriously&quot; but not as seriously as I take the question of, say, what I think I owe to other human beings, etc etc.  But as a matter of simple logic, given this, how I brush my teeth **is** &quot;remotely serious&quot; to, say, the evil of terrorism.  Is it *as* serious?  Lol, no.  It is &quot;remotely&quot; serious.<br>
<br>
I was speaking of a general class of human behavior, sociopathy.  It is a broad category, and it extends from the mildly serious (having bad sportsmanship) to the very serious (terrorism).  I gave a couple definitions of sociopathy that are broad enough so that we can talk about these two cases as existing along a single-continuum.<br>
<br>
Now, you can either debate my definitions of sociopathy, or you can argue that it is, for reasons other than cold logic, what we could call &quot;unethical&quot; to speak of poor sportsmanship and terrorism in a single breath.  I would entertain that argument, and it has merits for sure.  But as I said, the way my mind works, I see things on broad continuums, where I can compare (note: this is different from &quot;equate&quot;) two vastly different things because they share a common trait.  But to compare is not to equate, and I am sorry (for you) that you did not see that distinction operative here.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is no such thing as &quot;totally insignificant&quot; sociopathy.    Trivial sociopathy does not require things like war or prison, but it does require public disapproval.  So I am gonna publicly call guilds who leapfrog and such poor sportsmen, and take that garden-variety sociopathy with a modicum of seriousness, because I view such things on a broad and serious continuum.  <br>
<br>
If my mind's tendency to see things on broad continuums offended you, I apologize however.  But that is my &quot;perspective,&quot; so I don't think its accurate to say I have no idea of a perspective.  I most clearly do, at least of mine, and I think of yours too: your mind does not like to see things on broad continuums.  That's a perfectly valid perspective to have, but don't try to claim the moral highground over those who organize the data of the world differently than you.<br>

<br>
We killed the real (not nerfed) AoW with 45.  If you ever brought near 40 to a mob and we ran you over, you haven't mentioned it yet.<br>
<br>
When we went to basement, you were claiming with 18+ a few recruits.  Not 20 recruits or 30... not even 10 unless they were hiding or you tried counting the group that was killing under the ramp.<br>
<br>
You didn't just leave HP either, GM was involved. <br>
<br>
I remember clearly Salta insulting us and making comments when LC tried to run us out of basement with 35-40 people.   That's tagged ppl in-zone before they were... not 18 people with 30 &quot;going to log in soon&quot; or &quot;will be here later&quot; as we were being told in the basement.  So don't play that it's a wraith game.  Oh and same in Ntov... but of course it's only a bad thing and worthy of flames when we do it.   Of COURSE nobody EVER did that in old Vis.. that would be... completely hypocrical of Woow!  Woow is not a hypocrite, Vis never ever did anything of the sort, right?<br>
<br>
<br>
It's the same old story when old wraith caught up to vis, when LC caught up to vis, when we caught up to LC... it's the same scenarios over and over.. the new guy comes in with some folks and the old guard doesn't deem them &quot;worthy&quot; with what they have and tell them to leave.  Everybody with significant server kills have been involved in this same setup.<br>
<br>
Old Wraith and Old Vis fought each other till wraith disbanded and Vis nearly fell apart. It sucked.<br>
<br>
LC/Vis had their spat and started sharing.  Seemed to work good for them.<br>
<br>
We had our spat with LC and we started sharing.  Worked great for us, and with a few exceptions seems to make LC and Vis happy also.  <br>
<br>
Now Explicit is having their spat.   I am not top dog in Wraith, and I certainly wont' speak for LC and Vis.. but IMO it would be silly to not offer you guys a spot at the table.  You guys kill the majority of what we kill, and are getting better.  Everything esle is he said/she said bullshit.  <br>
<br>
Is the last few days how you *want* to play, or do you want to stop this crap?<br>

Must i repeat desi's reasons for being there? &quot;everbody wants a gimped cursed&quot;  Desi FLAT OUT lied to the guide when he said he killed all 10 triggers. Honestly im sick of this he did so we did crap...it's not why i log in everyday. You guys label explicit so bad...we've had a few issues with wraith(who hasnt?). 1 or 2 issues with vis and rel, and nothing with LC, besides maybe leader paranoid of our shop players or something. (on a side note...we had more then enough for a tormax...and vis is zoning in and we get a &quot;lucky darkoor isnt on, so i will back off&quot; &lt;--not exact quote)<br>
<br>
Must i rehash Wraith running past us killing statue after we killed vind? We would have passed on idol if not enough after statue(but how about trying to talk to a guild). Must i bring up us wiping on a creator and as we were buffing/finishing up res, desi brings his crew up to us and demands we leave? ...Does any of this justify anything any guild has ever done wrong to another? absolutely not....but unless your stupid blind representitive wants to actually be serious for once, then issues will keep happening. I have NO problems working with any guild including wraith, but i do have a problem with attitude desi throws off.  and gurunt only time we hold a mob w/ less then needed is when nobody is around, b/c we tried with HP no? you came up with enough we left. We've done every mob except emp/seru with less then the expected #s...it's what we do, so Im ver sick of the insufficient #s bs.<br>
<br>
and ward..tte ...if we have 20 on cursed, what's wrong with working with us? let us start our cycle you can easily take cursed b/c we wont have enough.

First thanks for apologizing to block the door in ogre form, it was unnecessary. Otherwise we didnt train each other when we both ran in initially, we just didn't deal with the traps properly and people died to the dots.<br>
<br>
Now I had no problems with Explicit running past us. We've competed before and the status quo has been to get ready and engage first. I'd like us to not be this confrontational but it hasn't come to be yet. We managed to get ready first and engaged like you said. The part you are wrong at is &quot;while we waited and watched&quot;. I'm sorry you are wrong and I can dig out logs and possibly screenshots showing soullance and few others running around in the room. We were fine till the mob reached 80 at which point the other golems in the room were trained. Although it is possible that someone in my raid messed up and agro'ed them but given the fact Explicit had ppl running around in the room, when they had no business being there, leads me to believe that either intentionally OR accidentally it was a explicit members.<br>
<br>
To all the Desi-haters in the room, Wassaaaaaap !!<br>
