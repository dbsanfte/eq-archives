<br>
&lt;snaps out of it&gt;<br>
<br>
As far as explicit goes, I can only say, explicit has some weird attitude thing going on.  Maybe some old grudge or belief that makes them think wraithrev needs to suffer.  <br>
<br>
But  what I constantly see with them is this, and you can either believe me or, like explicit will do, think I am lying: wraithrev does not leapfrog guilds that are already clearing to mobs, nor does wraithrev try to claim mobs that another guild already has a superior force in zone.  We do not do this to any other guild, including the macho, he-man explicit.  Explicit does both of these things, however, at least with us.  <br>
<br>
Anyone ever been on a raid where a guild leapfrogs past you as you are on the way clearing toward a mob, and maybe even only a few mobs away from that mob?  (like last night on creator.  how lame, explicit, how very very lame).  Or, ever have a small grp of people try to rush to a room to claim a mob even though they have but a bare couple handfuls of players in zone?<br>
<br>
What is truly pathological about explicit, and these core players in the guild have been like this their entire time on quellious, is that they do things to people that, if they were done to them, they would be furious.  Technical name for that is: sociopath.  A sociopath hurts other people, but thinks, since it is not hurting them, everyone who is complaining about their actions is not making sense.  Jeff Dahmer could not understand what all the fuss was about.  After all, he didn't mind what he did, so what's everyone getting upset about?<br>
<br>
Explicit will continue to grow, because, sadly, sociopathy is attractive to some people.  They think it means &quot;being tough.&quot;  No, it means being a sociopath. Also, some people will buy into the core membership's storyline and believe explicit is always in the right.  But let me ask them this: when is leapfrogging past a guild ever right?<br>
<br>
Let me ask that again: when is leapfrogging past a guild ever right?<br>
<br>
Hint: &quot;But it's wraith&quot; is not a rational answer, mmkay?  That's like the answer that Osama tries to give when answering the question, &quot;when is it ever right to kill innocent people,&quot; except he says, &quot;when they are americans.&quot;  And before you think that's an inappropriate comparison, think closely about your own actions.  Hatred and sociopathy come is small and large sizes. <br>
<br>
Messing with other guilds as they try to raid is always wrong.  Here is something explicit has never understood: if you log in to a zone, and find another guild has significantly more people than you there, or is already more than halfway to the mob you want, LEAVE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.  That's what us non-sociopaths do.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your adolescent sociopathy explicit.  You so tough!!<br>

I do believe the &quot;misrepresentation&quot; to the GM is all hearsay.  How does someone from explicit know what was said in tells to the gm? If i ran into some level 20 druid in lake of ill omen and said, &quot;hey man, Salta from LC is a warrior with like 3000ac!!&quot; to that guy, salta is a warrior with 3000ac, but thats just what he percieved from hearsay!<br>
<br>
 i along with alot of other people, percieve Explicit to be fucking scum, or at least the people that were there the last couple of nights.  Hops not Hype might think Explicit are the coolest cats on the scratch'n post, because explicit hooked them up with free stuff, went out of their way to help them, etc....<br>
<br>
anyway...um..yea<br>

edit: Barthin, your wrong, and right...Dolf and Denia were sold away, when i decided i was quitting a while back.  that lasted all of 2 months i think.

<br>
yeah right, i recall at least 5 times wraith leapfrog exp before last night and the cursed thingy.  I recall when I was in VM how wraithreviv tried to leapfrog KT from Rel and rel asked VM for help.  Btw, not only time either.  Everytime we tried to talk with wraith, biffins/grunt shut us off or just totally ignore us, and then run us over.  And afterward, desi just click his hotkey telling us, &quot;we don't think you guys have enough force so we decide to kill mob ourselves&quot;.  So everytime you ran us over, it's always our fault for not have enough.  Our usual raid number is in the 30s to 40s, it's nothing compare to wraitreviv--but that doesnt mean we dont have enough. And using the same excuss to run us over and over again is getting old.  Let's say if you have 60 ppl buffing for cursed, we suddenly show up with 100ppl and tell you to back down because we have more number, how will you feel? That's what your leaders have been doing to explicit past couple times we had run int.  I don't blame wraith member that their leaders are assholes and I feel sorry they have to deal with this kind of craps (maybe you have a diff view becoz your leaders keep lying to you). but no way I am backing down anymore.  Desi wants to play it dirty, he got it last night.  I hope he's happy.<br>
<br>
&quot;if you log in to a zone, and find another guild has significantly more people than you there, or is already more than halfway to the mob you want, LEAVE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO. &quot;<br>
<br>
No wonder you think wraithreviv never leapfrog other guild..coz there's no way a guild has significantly more ppl than wraithreviv....<br>
<br>
I talked to at least 2 wraith/reviv members last night after the conflict.  Bascially I told them I am sorry for what they have to deal with.  I am also sorry for posting craps like this in QC--i think this is the first time ever that i start a flame toward a guild. I dont think it's right, but I was mad.  so, too bad.  Anyway, I told them...I am willing to work with wraith/reviv, but only with someone I can trust, have a say in guild decision, and will show respect.  and I dont trust Desi/Droz and they never respect us--not that i respect them in any form, so i am guilty too.  Anyway, i dont want to get backstab and lied to again.  If you guys don't want to work it out. doesnt matter with us.  Just don't expect us to back off anymore like we used to.  Hope we made our statement very clear last night.<br>

<br>
are you denying that you guys last night followed us in as we cleared mobs on way to creator, then ran up the tube past us as we cleared the tube room?  Or are you admitting it?  Keep in mind, your case is not lost if you admit it.  You can always say that &quot;tough, we beat you to it by leapfrogging you, as you have done to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
But I have never been on a wraithrev raid where we leapfrogged another guild.  If we were to do so, I would log, since I don't play that way, and if ever you see me on a raid where that is happened, plz send me a tell, because I will tell the officers that I don't want to be a part of that kind of gameplay.<br>
<br>
I have been in wraithrev since May.  I have been one of the longest advocates of non-ffa gameplay, so I hope my word can count for something here.  You guys in explicit seem to be either grinding an axe by trying to mess with us, or you actually universally think tactics like leapfrogging are totally cool.  Either way, just admit what your approach is here.<br>
<br>
I will stand by my initial position: following another guild to a mob, then jumping past them at an opportune moment, is the lowest of the low.  Clearing to a mob is part of the definition of an encounter.  We were more than halfway cleared to creator when you all ran through us.  And are you denying that that is what explicit did last night?<br>
<br>
Plz let me know, wooowhatever, exactly what the dimensions of your self-delusions are here.  I need to know: have you convinced yourself you did not leapfrog, or have you convinced yourself you were justified in leapfrogging?  More stable minds want to know.<br>

<br>
The current Wraith and the current Vis are getting along well, and have a solid working relationship, with Lotus included in our tripartite love-fest where the big mobs are concerned.<br>
<br>
I personally have respect for the scrappy, up and coming guilds like RIP who are willing to fight for what they want, but doing it with style.  RIP, you may notice has not made legions of haters, nor do they inspire mass postings on QC.  Explicit, on the other hand, has and does.

<br>
Wrong on Tomax.  Rel had less than 20, they knew they didn't have the force to take him and we did.   They teamed with VM and got him before us.  More power to them.  We didn't follow them around the next day (either guild) and try to rush a mob every time we saw them move toward it.   We weren't even mad at them or VM.... what they did was SMART.. they had too few to do it themselves, knew they couldn't take him first alone, called Vis in (who had numbers nearby but realized Rel and Wraith were already there).. and got the job done.   Sure we would have *preferred* to have gotten him, but we didn't go on a tirade about it.<br>
<br>
Your only statement last nite was you don't care if ppl are at a mob in full force, you will rush it anyway.   Your only statement last night was you want to fight, and do not want to work things out.  <br>
<br>
None of the other top guilds camp ubermobs anymore BECAUSE it leads to fights.   It always has, always will.  Nobody agrees on how many ppl minimum it takes for a mob.. either for themselves or others.  <br>
<br>
Cursed is different from a lot of mobs... you can trigger and tie him up with almost nothing... that is why he is still on rotation.  (I know this is a broken record at this point)... nobody rotates HP or AoW or Arch Lich because nobody (cept Explicit) moves in to claim these mobs before they are ready to kill them.   <br>
<br>
If Wraith were to send 18 ppl to every ubermob as soon as it popped, you think Vis and LC would leave them all alone?  We're all past that.  We all know we'd fight over crap if we rushed an early holding crew to claim mobs, and none of us WANT to have to sit at a spawn for hours waiting for the calvalry to log on knowing we'll have conflict with the other guilds.<br>
<br>
I don't blow off people.  I *am* honest when I'm not the one in charge and can't make a final decision.  Desi may not be the greatest diplomat in the history of Quellious, but he is hardly unreasonable when you come to discuss things rationally.  Not jump another raid then try to talk, or try to talk when you can't kill the mob and hope the rest of your team logs in while you chat.   <br>
<br>
You want in on cursed?  Just ask.  Not when he's up and you have half a force there trying to hold of a full raid.  Ask tonite, this weekend.. when he's not up... when nobody is mobilizing at the time to kill him.  <br>
<br>
Don't want &quot;leapfrogging&quot; fights?  Don't camp the mobs... move in and kill the mobs instead.   Vis/LC/Wraith can have a group or two at every ubermob within minutes of  a pop to camp it until the calvalry arrives... you think mobs are left alone for hours at a time because we don't know they are up?  If LC has a force on sooner they will move in and take it.  If if Vis has a force on sooner they will move in and take it.  We won't bother sending a placeholder team to try and fend them off, and they don't do it to us.   <br>

Where you see me denying we leapfrog you? i am not desi, i dont lie.  We did leapfrog you, on purpose, to make a statement.  We are not going to back off from any of desi's 'you dont have enough' crap anymore.  I don't like it, I don't want to do it, it's not fun for me.  But if wraith don't want us to have fun, we are not going to let you guys have fun either.<br>

how did you justify the cursed conflict then? we started the cycle -----&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;part of an encounter, desi lied to GM, wraith leapfrog us to kill cursed.../em wait for someone to say 'we have more ppl than you so you should back off'.  So..now, you tell me. have you convinced yourself you did not leapfrog, or have you convinced yourself you were justified in leapfrogging?

<br>
<br>
There was precedent on this with GM's repeatedly.  You can't claim a mob without the force to kill it.<br>
<br>
Cursed is a majorly f'ed up mob cycle when it's ffa becasue 2 people could claim it if we played your way.   We could send 2 ppl to the  basement at any time, kill a TM, then say &quot;we'll be able to kill him by the time he spawns later&quot;.   You *would* respect that, right?  <br>
<br>
Obviously we don't.  History shows at least LC don't.  So to keep things civil since Cursed has the best pre-emperor drops and is so easily tied up, we rotate him.<br>
<br>
One problem with rotations... they are GREAT when the mob is exclusive.... they get to be a problem when it is not.   You guys have no choice BUT to bust into the rotation if you want a shot... so conflict at some point is inevitable.   Unlike other mobs, if we say 'ah fuck it' and leave.. we don't get to come back next spawn... we gotta wait for our turn again.  So we're not gonna back down unless you are clearly there with the immediate intent and capacity to kill.  Cursed is a 3 week spawn for us.  18 is nowhere near a cursed force.  With one cleric it may not even been an ae-less cursed force. <br>
<br>
You don't want to fight?  Stop fighting, start talking... start playing with the rest of the server.  <br>
<br>
Name calling and bitching here is meaningless.... all the big 3 have made novels worth of it.. but the fact is we get along as a whole and we don't jump each other.   Fact is you do.  So continue, or stop.  Don't matter how much Desi and Darkoor may not *like* you, don't matter how much you don't like them... come to the table to work things out, they'll get worked out... and the random MB trolls who get off on this sort of thing (/wave salta) will be the extent of it from then on.<br>

Please answer that question..because it is a FACT that you had 17 guild members online when you started to try and trigger the cycle...YES you killed the first Taskmaster.  Wraith had 54 people Ready in the zone to your 17 TOTAL ONLINE!<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you saying we were wrong because your 17 (actually 15 because 2 people where not in ssra) killed the first taskmaster? and therefore are entitled the entire cycle?<br>
<br>
Wraith was moving down to the basement as the TM's were reportedly FINALLY spawning...We had 20 to 30 in the basement and everyone else enroute...but IN THE ZONE!!  Explicit saw that this was happening, and decided to start killing triggers with 15 people...EXPLICIT was NOT ready to engange the cursed cycle, Wraith/reviv WAS...We engaged it, you didn't.  You wanna petition GM's and try to be civil when you know your getting beat...bullshit...we were ready and we killed it...end of fucking story...You wanna race, untill you are getting beat...then you wanna be a diplomat...BULLSHIT!! k?<br>

But they just didn't have enough to show &quot;significantly more people&quot; than wraith.  Knowing wraith is going to leapfrog them no matter what they said to wraith, they called for help. yup..smart of them.  VM/Rel buff up, showing &quot;significantly&quot; more ppl than wraith/revive. Did wraith/revive back down? nope.  VM/Rel Started clearing.  Did Wraith/Reviv back down(clearing is a part of encounter)?nope.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Your only statement last nite was you don't care if ppl are at a mob in full force, you will rush it anyway. &quot;<br>
<br>
Just like what Wraith have been doing to us. Except with an excuse &quot;we think you dont have enough force&quot;.  What goes around, comes around.  You guys only had 40s, &quot;we didnt think you have enough force&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your only statement last night was you want to fight, and do not want to work things out.&quot;<br>
Hard to work things out when your leaders either ignore or insult us.  Good..at least you notice us now.  We tried to be fair, we tried to work things out.  But can't you guys be any more unreasonable?  I remember one time, HP and creator both up.  We saw wraiths in zone, do camp check, send tell to desi asking what you are killing..no respond.  OMG..how nice of you guys.  So we thought we may as well clear up since wraith can't kill 2 mobs same time.  We cleared up, have coth set up, buffing for hp...guess what wraith did? LEAPFROG us after killed creator and kill hp...yeah, now that i think about it, wraith really wants to work things out. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't camp the mobs... move in and kill the mobs instead&quot;<br>
We did exactly that..last night.  Didn't camp, just move in, you like that? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/udeloresmulva.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delores Mulva</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Reet Knight</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/18/02 2:27:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTB Planar Rifts</span><hr size=1> Acturian - you might want to check that portal again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The events I detailed happened between two and four weeks ago, IIRC - Arianwen was on the raid with us, she might remember her first time up there for an exact time.

<br>
He was trying to back up his earlier comment, that Explicit had killed some of the Taskmasters yet Wraith claimed to the GM that Wraith had killed them all and thus was entitled to the spawn. He didn't really care who was &quot;entitled&quot; to the spawn - he just wanted to point out that the leadership of Wraith are two-faced sacks of shit.<br>
<br>
It's something that's hard to get across when flaming Wraith/Reviv, but Woow touched on it in this thread. The guilds that &quot;hate&quot; W/R don't hate most of the people in W/R. They hate one small group, the leadership group of Wraith, and the sorts of crap that one group pulls. I wish more people would be specific about that, since it might open some eyes in W/R as to the assclowns you have representing you. Instead you get people in the two guilds who have done nothing wrong but follow orders from their leaders feeling like they are personally hated, and a bunker mentality forms. Like Denia's. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
