Just a thought here is a little tidbit of the type of thing im talking about.<br>
<br>
The child of darkness unfolded himself from the shadows as the last of the day’s light slipped below the horizon. He stepped out of his temporary crypt and surveyed the landscape around him. His dark skin and black robe blended in with the night perfectly, his bone white hair a sharp contrast to the darkness. His blood red eyes glowed in the night as he walked out into the plains. He knelt in the darkness, bowing his head, whispering words in the dark language to his god Innoruuk. He promised his Prince that much blood would be shed in his name on this glorious night.<br>
After his nightly prayer, he rose, his eyes full of power. He began to weave the threads of the dark magic, chanting softly the words needed, feeling a part of his soul torn from his body as he created his loyal servant. He opened his eyes, glancing once at the skeleton that stood before him. He sighed softly, eager for the day he could call forth a minion of such destructive force that Lord Innoruuk him self would take notice of the carnage the dark servant has set upon the lands. He knew that would come soon enough, he only needed to prove his worth to his Lord.<br>
He moved out into the plains, darkness his cover. His blood red eyes penetrated the night, searching for prey. Soon, he spots his victim. He moves in closer, under the cover of night. He called forward the dark magic again, gathering the darkness and surrounding the creature with it. It lunged for him, but his faithful minion steppes in front of him, slashing at the creature. He smiled as the skeleton cackles in glee. It’s thirst for blood almost matches his. He weaved the magic, sending tendrils of his soul into the creature, and sucking the life out of it. Within moments, the creature lay dead at his feet. His minion cackles, and grinnes at him, it’s eyes glowing. He needs more magic to kill again. He whispered to his lord, offering his life for magic. He stumbled a second as the life slowly begins to drain from him. He sits, allowing his life to be exchanged for more power. The pact sent ripples of blinding pain through his body, and he enjoys it. <br>
Soon, he had the power he needed. Weakened from the exchange, he searches for his next victim. Suddenly, he staggeres as teeth tore into his skin. His minion quickly jumping on the attacker, pulling it off of him. He quickly sent tendrils of his soul into the creature, regaining his own life by depriving the creature of its own. It died quickly, and he allowed his pet to feed for a moment as he entered the death pact once again. <br>
As he sat, he remembered. He remembered his first encounter with his lord. He remembered his voice… {Childe, know ye who I am?} Aye, M’Lord. You are the Prince of Hate, the Bringer of Death. You are the darkness. You are the incarnation of death. You are Innoruuk. He had knelt before him, trembling inside, fearful that he would not accept her as his, fearful that he would not be granted the power of death. {And ye wish for the power?} He swallowed, controlling his fear. Yes me lord. I wish to learn the power of death. {Ye are but a childe. There will be much learning before ye are granted the full power…} I understand, my lord. I will grow, I will learn, I will become your most powerful servant. {Then look at me my childe.} He had looked at him then, his dark eyes widening at the sight of him. He reached for him, placing his powerful hand upon his shoulder. The knowledge of the darkness flooded into him, ripping into his soul. He released him, and he almost collapsed. His eyes shut for a moment, seeing the visions he had sent him. When he opened his eyes again, and looked at him, the childs eyes were as red as fresh blood. The agreement had been made, he was a child of Innoruuk now, a child of darkness. He stood before his lord, power flowing though him. He heard him say one more thing before he sent him back to his world. {Ye will be a powerful one, childe. Go, learn. Soon, ye will stand at my side and we will reclaim the land in darkness.}<br>
He opened his eyes, smiling at the memory. Indeed, one day, he would stand beside his lord as the world is reclaimed in the name of darkness and death. Fear me for I am the chosen one he chants before my day is done the world of Norrath shall know true fear. Hail Lord Innoruuk.<br>
