<br>
I refused to camp Sev, because I didnt want to waste my guilds time to kill a mob for ME, period.  Everything I've gotten from my guild has been when we were doing something for the GUILD, I personally think its silly to ask so many people to come kill a mob just so ONE person (me) can get a drop.  This is just a personal thing for me, hence the reason I never got my epic until now....all the pieces I got for my epic was during raids helping others, not raids you get ME drops.... thats not how I run shop.  I stated I would get my scale in VP because my GUILD would be there clearing it for my GUILD, not for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
No, I'm not missing or overlooking the point at all.  I don't consider it a valid excuse to nerf a class specific ability.  What do you call it when guilds more than capable of clearing NToV and Ssra mobs continue to kill first brood dragons and farm keys for Sleeper's Tomb, a zone clearly beneath their capabilities?  It's certainly not being done for the challenge.  It's being done for the easy to get loot.  It's stealing mid-level content from other guilds for whom the encounters were designed.  And as long as farming is openly or tacitly endorsed by Verant, be it in the form of time sink quests to obtain multiple rare drops, incessant half assed revisions of encounters after players find ways to beat them faster or more efficiently using the spells and items they put in the game for it, allowing coding defects/bugs for mob advantage while simultaneously classifying it as an exploit when players use them, or hideous gaps in equipment progression as groups advance in the game, I openly reject the concept of &quot;stealing mid-level content&quot; as a justification to nerf class specific abilities.<br>
<br>
But let's just continue to cloud the issue that Montyy was flat out against manaburn yet turned around and endorsed it the moment it turned him a personal profit.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dont you think he'd want a shot at MTing Sev for his own epic?&quot;<br>
<br>
I should think this because...<br>
1.  He stated flat out he refused to camp or bother with checking on Severilous.<br>
2.  He was going to wait until/if his guild got around to going to Veeshan's Peak to get his scale and lacked the initiative to bother with organizing a raid there himself.<br>
3.  He stated he didn't need his epic and had better.<br>
4.  He ranked completing his epic important because it cleared out bank space.<br>
<br>
Perhaps when he started his quest, it was something he wanted but times and equipment upgrades changed that.  I don't know or care but either way, that doesn't strike me as someone with the motivation or inclination to complete their epic.<br>
<br>
Sephrok states:  &quot;montyy accepted an item to complete his epic from a friend&quot;<br>
<br>
Obtained using tactics he publicly denounced and slammed people for using.  It's called selling out your beliefs for personal profit.  <br>
<br>
&quot;how can they make a 32khp mob harder then any other 32k hp mob when it dies instantly?&quot;<br>
<br>
Just on manaburn alone, aside from partial or full immunity to manaburn?  I don't know, maybe something like the mob having an ability to deflect half or full damage into an AE.  Gee, that makes manaburn useless as a tactic for that mob now doesn't it? (I think that would be a great ability for Solusek Ro personally.)  How about instead of doing damage the manaburn actually heals the mob.  Again rendering manaburn situationally useless in that encounter.<br>
Giving mobs the ability to fly out of melee range but still remain in archery/spellcasting range.  (God forbid we break away from the main tank strategy though.)<br>
Only allowing certain weapon types to do maximum damage (Not bane weapons but blunt vs. slashing vs. piercing.)<br>
Verant took the lazy way out though.<br>
<br>
and  &quot;However i do feel sorry for other wizards and understand why they'd be pissed, they did nerf it on an extreme level, but.. it had to be done, it was just to late though.&quot;<br>
<br>
You don't get it do you?  They didn't nerf it because wizards were farming Kunark dragons.  If they cared about people farming Kunark dragons they'd have done something long ago when it was single guilds monopolizing the spawns on a given server.  Wizards are still capable of using manaburn to kill Kunark dragons in under a minute, they proved that on day one of the nerf.<br>
<br>
They did it because they don't want wizards on a raid burning their precious PoP mobs with the insanely high AC and damage output.  Verant doesn't want manaburn to be used on the very content all the self-righteous anti-manaburners think manaburn should only be used on.<br>
<br>
<br>
And Montyy, I could have a field day with your last statement, but will be uncharacteristically nice (Get your ice skates, Hell froze over.  No wait, that's hailstones.) and tell you that you may want to take a closer look at what you just said because the way you phrased that, it sounds like you're saying you aren't worth your guild's time.<br>

If you weren't an ignorant dumbass you'd know that i do get it =)<br>
<br>
My argument vs Manaburn is it allowed for a mob to die INSTANTLY... which mean the mob's abilities didnt matter... one 32k hp mob was the same as a giant rat or another 32khp mob that hit for signifigantly greater and had different abilities.<br>
<br>
If Wizards are still capable of killing dragons in under a minute... props to them... no objections here.. as long as its not instantly with a group of 5.<br>
<br>
It is too late for them to care about guilds farming Kunark dragons, because as i said above, the economy is already f'd beyond anything fixable regarding loot from those dragons.  So what is your point Mr. Ignorance? Ooo you are outsmarting me by re-iterating what i said in different words trying to turn something around on me.<br>
<br>
I believe we have a term for that, dont we Zeik? FLIPPANT!  Stop being flippant la~<br>
<br>
Manaburn got nerfed, you were wrong biatch... and now you are scraping up every little thing you can to try and turn it around on others... how about you just stop your stupid child games and leave this with some dignity... too bad you wont and you'll likely follow up this post misquoting me.. using half of my sentences.. etc.. trying to turn this around and dilute whatever is left there is to dilute.<br>
<br>
And with that said, i would like to leave you with the following to ponder:<br>

&quot;Esmalyn... yer a bit off track.&quot;<br>
-- Quas<br>
<br>
This whole fucking thread is off track. It all started when FK was angry MB got nerfed &amp; said Nazi, a no-no word right up there with nigger. (Time out for an obligatory and hearty FUCK YOU to anyone who may insinuate I'm a racist while spick, ho, and other racial/sexist slurs continue to play loud and clear on local radio airwaves.) Montyy had his kicks, and it's been going in circles since. Work has kept me from playing as much as dedicating a new thread to him. <br>
<br>
&quot;If yer armor or levels are great, you do it with one group. Otherwise, it's 2-3 groups.<br>
<br>
&quot;The POINT is that the content is still there.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you get the POINT yet?&quot;<br>
-- Quas<br>
<br>
Well, I wonder what new insight we were supposed to glean when Montyy revealed through superior powers of observation: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Quas and Autum and co. <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>were able to clear 5 of the 6 reaver spawns and get 3 jade reaver drops with FOUR people.... and all four are at around HoT Armor level gear wise.</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> Sorry that idea don't work either</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. My sarcastic reply under the quote followed.<br>
<br>
But anyway... my beef hasn't specifically been with Reavers or selling loot. ::sighs:: I feel like all I'm going to do is repeat myself, have someone try to redirect my focus, and get asked do I get the point again. I might even get lucky and get called a bitch/cunt for refusing to let it drop. (Hi FK!) We're a nuisance when we won't play along.<br>
<br>
I'm not focused on scales or Reavers.<br>
<br>
I'm not focused on the evil MB teams at the moment.<br>
<br>
I'm not focused on selling -any- epic items.<br>
<br>
And contrary to what Montyy et al may feel right now, there isn't a triumvirate between Milli, FK and myself bent on bringing low the ogre. I could, if I had a mind, start talking all kinds of trash about him and do a better job of pissing others off that way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Now <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>montyy</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->... regardless of past posts etc, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>is not against manaburn itself. He's against the burn squads that use it to remove content from the midlevel guilds...</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> and make the warrior epic all but impossible to attain without paying for it.&quot;<br>
-- Quas<br>
<br>
Ohhh.. right! So when Montyy made statements like this one: &quot;Wow, so FK you are not a farmer? hmm so you are burning dragons for what then exactly? epic drop....hmmm nope not that....to get gear for yourself? hmm well maybe you are in dire need of a torbins eyepatch or something...<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>or maybe you are continously killing them just becuase you are a nice person and want to get epics drops and dragon haste items for guildies.....hmm naw dont think that's it either. Well sounds like a farmer to me</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->&quot; on the first <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=323.topic&amp;start=251&amp;stop=300">manaburn thread</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, what he really meant was manaburning wizards were greedy farmers serving their own purposes except Gaethan! Of course it wasn't the fact that he got a free scale off a burn crew. The key was Gaethan all along! Man, how did I miss that? Then again, he could have also meant he was against manaburn when it removed content from other warriors except himself. That's a possibility.<br>
<br>
C'mon Montyy baby. Admit that you were willing to benefit from actions that you publicly condemned when it suited you. I'll leave this thread.<br>
