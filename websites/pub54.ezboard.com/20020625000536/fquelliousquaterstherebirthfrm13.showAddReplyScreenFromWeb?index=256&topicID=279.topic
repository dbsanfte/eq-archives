Exactly ... thats what started this entire thing. had yall waited and let reliant take a crack at it and then killed the Wraith after they failed i doubt there would have been a flame this big. (im not sayin no flame you can get flamed for anything just not one this Huge or valid)<br>
<br>
Q i have no problems with you personaly i do belive that i have replaced you in groups b4 all of which were well buffed and chanter friendly so dont take my flame as a personal attack you are the only one i have seen so far that is Actually standing up and saying ok maybe we were wrong heres what i am goning to do to fix it, rather than sayin we won screw you. <br>
<br>
as to the other things i posted  i only post facts .. as you saw when i mentioned the Yael thing .. we raced you won and whiped we moved in and got kill then resed your people.&lt;no problems here still respected your guild&gt;<br>
<br>
your people DID open the door in hot repetedly when we were fighting other mobs. &lt; i was pissed at the time but was willing to let it go&gt;<br>
<br>
your people did tell us good luck and then pull sev out from under us. &lt; id like to get mad at you for this but you pulled first it is a contesed spawn you won congrats&gt;<br>
<br>
your people did enter fear with the intent to &quot;take' this mob from another enchanter. thats just not right. its just as rude to walk up on some druid camping halv in sfm and ask him to share everyother spawn. sure you can but you would be a jerk for askin cause its just gona waist both peoples time.  <br>
<br>
this could have been avoided had the guilds involved just agreed to roll from the begining. Yet another attack of the Blue Falcon.<br>

You said it is rude to just walk into a plane and take a mob from another ench. I agree totally ... i would never have done it if i wasnt deceived, been issued false promises and generaly been shitted on with what i feel was the sole purpose to delay ADD to go into the plane first. As qindien said while i was negotiating with trist and he was going what i understood as stalling they suicided into pof with insufficient force only so Trist could say later we went in first we dont want agreement anymore. Later he agreed well wait for GMs decision on it ... while i waited for GM to respond he went ahead and tried to get the mob anyway regardless of his own proposal to which i agreed. When i asked guild to go in and kill the mob my plan was not to kill it and have Qin loot but rather to kill it and force that agreement i was promised. Only when i heard reports of Tristadorn training camp and ppl saying its gonna be a wipeout i told Qin to loot it. Was i nice? Personally i think i was nicer than Tristadorn in this. Was i fair? I tried to be but was screwed at every turn. In the end it all columinated in qindien looting the piece still by verants rules bo not really in what would be considered nice manner ... because of that he offered to give the piece to Maeve if they did not get the piece untill tuesday. He got full officer support for that and i think that was a BIG gesture. He even went to PoF with Radiant to help camp shissar. But guess what ... im told next day that if shissar pops that day they wont give the head to Maeve but instead just use Qins niceness and try to get 2 pieces out of it (rumor not necessarily true but worth a mention). Bottom line as you said Kroud .. had Tristadorn agreed at any point during the entire fiasco (about 20-30 min prior to Radiant entering the PoF up to the point when he allegedly trained us) to ANY of my proposals or simply have stuck to what he himself proposed and i agreed on nothing of this would have happened.<br>
<br>
Lack of comunication is what causes most of crap on this server. When there is competition for a mob always have one person from one party and one person from another party discuss it. Just someone sending tells to random ppl in other party doesnt achieve @#%$ if they dont have the executive power to back up what they promised. As was said  ... when rage was pulled the leader of opposing force didnt know that Grim got tells promising him first try. The tells were obviously sent by someone who wasnt in charge and had no place to talk about it with Grim. Hence the misunderstanding and bad blood between the guilds.<br>
<br>
I wasnt there so i cant give accurate description but same thing could have happened with Sev .. i dont know who /oocd the good luck for your guild there but i suspect it was random guildie #004 who had absolutely no insight in raid leaders thoughts or had any knowledge of the comunication between the 2 raid leaders if there even was any.<br>
<br>
As for yael thing ... as you yourself said it was a competition to which we agreed ... you beat us fair and square after we messed up and pulled yael while oom hhe. Problem is that several of your guildies attacked me for a liar for saying exactly what you said. Its all in perception and the level of information you posess. They were not informed well and they almost made me look a liar with nothing more than relaying flawed perceptions of something they had no idea about. Even on the points on which they had 1st hand information which is very plain to see they couldnt agree (time of arrival and size of respective forces). <br>
<br>
Im not trying to bash anyone im just trying to point out that if ur not 100.1% SURE dont post or post simple facts. Notice that i didnt ever say in my posts that tristadorn DID train us .. i actually dont know that for a fact .. i simply said my guildies reported him training us. That is huge jump in discussion ethics ... while i simply state facts there are many people here who have posted with the intent to force their perceprion of events on other people (so they would not even try to form their own opinion) even though they cannot possibly posess the information relevant and needed to describe the happenings. Sadly as is populistic gossip is read more willingly because it doesnt charge the reader with the effort of forming his/her own opinion over the matter and can rather lazily accept for granted what someone else says and what coicides most approprietly with what the reader is feeling at the moment (mother pissed him off 2 hours ago about something he perceived unjust so he is far more inclied to beleive ADD is @#%$ especially there are people stating yes ADD IS @#%$ while i only post dry and boring facts which wouldnt make good movie material).<br>
<br>
As for the HoT training ... i wasnt there again but i aknowledge it did happen. I find it foolish to beleive we would have done it on purpose though. For every action everyone needs a motive and there was no possible motive there. If our force went into the hall away from zone we had no contact to door camp nor did they inhibit us in any way nor we them. When train/door opening happened it must have been an accident or some inexperience coupled with uncertainty of what to do sprinkled on top with panic. We are not accomplished raiders in ADD. We are not even what a person would call a raiding guild. We have many people that are still to low to be allowed in HoT or some other higher level raids with us and when they are allowed for the first time they are like infants at that particular task. Mistakes happen and we are all sorry for that ... i have no idea why everyone assumes the worst even in spite of common sense.<br>
<br>
Well the moral of the story would be communication is the key ... always have ONE person talking to ONE person and dont do anythig untill those two are done talking. Even when those two people are trying to reach an agreement it isnt civil nor diplomatic to go ahead and try to do what is still being discussed. Once something is agreed stick to it no matter what or reach another agreement with same person before you change your course of action.<br>
<br>
Well in my characteristic post when i have something to say (LONG) i hope tossed out some food for thought at least for those of you who do your own thinking and i hope those who do the thinking are the shepherds not the sheep. Please do thake the time to read this heh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I am not trying to open up this thread again, but plz you need to read what Bane has posted as well, and not jump on the ADD ks'd bandwagon. Even the gm's have said they checked the logs and it wasnt a ks situation. <br>

If i seem to remember somebodys post earlier, somebody said that folks even group up for exp in Fear, well if thats the case, and Banelion tried reasoning with folks, whats to say that Radiant wasnt there getting experience and also trying to reserve a mob, which you cant really do.<br>
<br>
This all harkens back to certain instances from when the server was young, some may remember this and you newbs may not. But when you were in Highold Keep killing orcs, just waiting for that one named orc to spawn, when he did, you had that one wizzy on that one rock invis who nuked the crap out of it to get the kill<br>
<br>
Now some of you may say no it isnt the same, but in essence it is. We had two guilds vying for the same spawn, and we, ADD, wanted to compromise for it. Actually now that I think of it, how can you say they were in the zone enforce just because they were there. They might have been just doing an exp group. Who are we to second guess them, and if Banelion contacted them and said hey Tristadorn, what are you doing, lets compromise on this situation, and then you get stalled....how many of you would have acted the same in the heat of passion.<br>
<br>
I may keep rehashing this, but I wont stop arguing over the fact that there are always two sides to the coin. What you may hear because they may be your friends, might not always be what really happened. We all like to go thru life thinking that our friends would never give us any disinformation, no no not them. But when it happens, then what. Act like an adult and fess up like people have done in the past.<br>
<br>
I wasnt there myself so what do I know, I am defending my guild. Qindien has gottem emails from the gms stating that there is no case of ks'ing but he, so far to this day, will try to hand over the item in question. He spoke with Radiant from what I was told and if they didnt get the shissar by Tuesday than he would give it back. But Radiant was in Hate camping the shissar , but not for Maeve but for another chanter in the guild, seeing that Qindien put forth a deal and they were still confident they were gonna get the piece.<br>
<br>
I havent logged in the game for awhile today so I have no clue what happened to dat, but if Radiant did this then it really sucks.<br>
<br>
I have no love fo rthat guild. I had my cleric rezzed them after the Fay incident and not one thank you from Tristadorn did I recieve. I did get one from Shaekee who I feel is a very nice person. But Tristadorn that bastard can't even be the man, and know when it is better to save face than save pride.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have taken alot of crap from you folks on this board, which I find quite amusing. But I still try to find a common ground which we all can coexist, but even that is slowly fading away IMHO. <p>Garaddor Ghoulbane

While I will defend Maeve to the bitter end (when Tristadorn isn't playing her), and I will likewise defend other members of Radiant - Shaekee above all others, Tristadorn's conduct borders on unconscionable (as usual)<br>

<br>
Brazin, your ramblings remind me of a chicken clucking as it pecks at bugs in the dirt.<br>
<br>
Banelion, I'm sorry to have come into conflict with you.  I wish we had met under better circumstances.  Perhaps if you had been in attendance on the fear raid, things would have turned out much better.  /salute<br>
<br>
Qindien, I'm sorry your epic quest has been tainted by this nonsense.  If you need help acquiring the piece in hate, i would be willing to assist you (though i do not speak for my guild in this).  I know you tried to return the epic piece to Maeve, and the GM-admin said that he will not transfer no-drop items regardless of the way in which they were acquired.  It was a nice gesture, but it seems you will get to keep the piece.  While I am upset and angry that my dear friend Maeve will now have to wait much longer to finish her epic, I don't hold any grudges against you personally.<br>
<br>
to those who complain about the length of this flame thread: obviously some people are pretty upset about this whole thing, on both sides.  The reason I and my guildmates are upset is more the principle of the thing than the loss of the epic piece (although we did sit in fear all weekend, no shissar argh).  being trampled over and feeling disrespected by other players is bound to create some negative emotions.  In my opinion, it's better to get that out in the open rather than let it stew into an intense hatred for eachother.  perhaps this way we can avoid future mistakes and unecessary conflict.<br>
<br>
i'll leave you with this final thought... it's only loot, a pixel in a game.  if you step back and look at it from that perspective, is &quot;lewt&quot; really worth disrespecting, lying, cheating, flaming, and wasting eachother's time?  i don't mean this to be an accusation solely at ADD, but rather, a question to all high end players in EQ (including myself).  i've come to the conclusion that the game would be much more fun if we could all just relax, and quit tearing at eachother's throats.  i sincerely hope i am not just dreaming, and that this is really possible.<br>
<br>
send me a /tell in game if you want to discuss anything else in this matter.<br>
