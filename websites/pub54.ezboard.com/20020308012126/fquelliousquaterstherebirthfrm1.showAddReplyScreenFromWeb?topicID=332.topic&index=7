If someone is willing to put in the time they can gain most of the things I pay a penalty to get without the draw backs I have. I am not complaining about that as it goes both ways to a degree, with the skills and gear available I can make up a lot of short comings.<br>
Maybe a better example of my complaint is to say that with the people I used to play with I pulled for most raids we did. While pulling I die a lot because my FD doesn't recycle fast enough to give me a second chance usually if it fails, this mask would save me a lot of deaths (meaning exp too) and would allow me to keep pulling faster and steadier meaning the other people on the raid are happier because they aren't sitting around waiting for me to recover yet again.<br>
Enchanters are a class that dies as much or more as pullers from what I've seen, wouldn't you be pissed if you were denied an item that would cut down significantly on that?<br>
Maeve you say we shouldn't complain about needing to swap spells but at least casters and healers get  break to do it either during a fight or while pulls are happening. If I am pulling and doing a good job of it I never have a break, I am either fighting or bringing back the next mob so it is something I would appreciate.<br>
Salta I know it is my choice to play this char and I don't want to have to start over. You say choosing a religion has been a benefit but I bet there is more times it has been a disadvantage. I am sure there has been times you were unhappy with your choices and if you chose not to voice your opinions that's your choice. I am not happy and I am sure there is a lot of other people that aren't happy about this same thing and I am choosing to say something. I am not making comments about a class/race that I haven't played to the end game so I think my opinion is valid.<br>
If I was making comments about chanter's issues then you'd have every reason to trash me but how many of you have a 55+ troll or ogre SK?<br>

My statement still stands though, and I'd reference it with examples except I don't know all the details. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But I'll try.. there's a shadowknight one-handed weapon that drops in the Plane of Hate for small race shadowknights, and a two-hander for large races.  With the new Alternate Advancement skills that allow shadowknights to bash without a shield (I'll assume it exists since you hinted at it), the small shadowknights would be upset because they'd want access to the better damaging two-hander from Hate that the large shadowknights can use, as they're not longer forced to use the sword/shield combo to bash.  Of course, the small shadowknights aren't complaining, because there's other items in other zones that fill the void.  Perhaps there's a similar item in another zone to the Feign Death mask for bigger shadowknights.. more likely, as mentioned earlier, it's going to be nerfed with a 3 or 4 second (or more) cast time, now that people are starting to raise a fuss (and I agree that monks likely will be complaining too).  It goes back to the advantages and disadvantages..<br>
<br>
I see the point you're trying to make about wanting access to an item that prevents you from dying, but that doesn't really apply to me because I like to take stupid risks (like tanking in the Halls of Testing) and see exactly how far I can push my fragile form.  But forgetting that.. yeah, most enchanters would like to have an item that casts Dazzle in 3.2 seconds and has an instant recast (which Dazzle normally doesn't have), or an item that casts a Colour stun in 2.5 seconds and has no recast.  But even if such items came out and were restricted to, say, high elf enchanters (because they're the wussiest, of course), it wouldn't really bother me because it doesn't take anything away from my personal skills at playing, and also because I know that if I raise a big ruckus, the item would likely be nerfed and then everyone (high elf and dark elf alike) would be back to square one.  If an item is so powerful that people without it complain, then in the views of the designers, it's probably too powerful for the game.  Whether that's right or wrong isn't my place to judge (though I'm inclined to say it'd be right, if the complaints are truly valid).<br>
<br>
And one last thing since it was brought up.. I want more spell slots too!  I have to swap too much.. especially with the new agro/deagro spells that everyone wants to try out.  &quot;Okay, use the agro boost on the main tank.. then when we do a tank switch, deagro the old tank and agro the new one.. and don't forget to Tash, and redo Clarity on these groups, and have mez up in case we get adds, some will require Rapture, a big charm might help turn the tide, and I really want Gift of Brilliance and Enlightenment and Visions of Grandeur, not Shissar!&quot; All that makes it hard for me to keep Curse of the Simple Mind memorized.. but it still is, because nothing beats seeing the emote &quot;King Tormax looks stupid&quot;. *Looks innocent*<br>

As for Valdayana.. did you call paladins a useless class? I can pound any other class into the ground in a duel when i was a paladin and still could even with inferior gear.. Paladins are the best duelers no contest.<br>

I cast it at completely random times for the hell of it and I still get a good laugh now and then.<br>
<br>
As far as the main point of this topic goes I can understand why you're frustrated but understand you still get advantages that other races do not.  The bash w/out shield thing is a skill (from what I understand).... something you as a troll/ogre get by doing absolutely nothing that someone else has to sink hours of extra exping into.  Your base sta is insanely high translating into extra HP you'll have to take a beating with while the little sk's that fail a FD die after one round of trying.  You got along before SoL even came out and you'll find a way to get along regardless of what the smaller sk's can do with SoL.  <br>
<br>
If you want to raise issues of ways people got screwed w/ SoL look no farther than my main's class.  All the melee classes got nice dmg and skill upgrades.... wizards receive the ability to increase their dmg output twofold with crit casts, and I don't really know enough of the necro's and mage's skills to comment on those (they probably got just as screwed as chanters did).  You know what we got?  <br>
<br>
1.  We get the ability to completely refresh our mana pool every 2 hours (for those oh so common mana downages that come on the hour every 2 hours.  I could possibly see this useful for just after you died but that's about it)....<br>
2.  the &quot;chance&quot; to permanently charm a sub 49 mob every 72 minutes (the only reasonably useful looking skill we get which still has the chance to get resisted and which is still breaking for people despite it being called a &quot;perma charm&quot;).... <br>
3.  the ability to keep an illusion as I zone (because if you're unlucky enough to run into a city with a kos guard there we all know how difficult it is to run right out... better yet we all know how hard it is to invis before you zone so you can scout for guards ahead of time)<br>
4.  the ability to have a group buff become an ae buff every 72 minutes  (mind you the only group buffs enchanters have are resist magic and c2.... both of which have a duration of under 30 mins.  Can you imagine the tell hell for buffs once wears off if there isn't anyone w/ the skill popped to rebuff?)<br>
<br>
I know that's more of a class unbalance issue rather than a race one but my point is that we all have things that just aren't fair to us that we have to deal with.  You've survived to this point in your eq existence just fine with the way things were and nothing has been done to hinder your ability to do that.  So a few other people have it a bit easier... how is that ruining your playing?  We all get that message when we first create our characters telling us how difficult our race/class/diety combination is and I'm sure you were told that being an evil large race would be more difficult than being a boring plain old human.  <br>
<br>
And I still stand by my statements in regards to spell swapping.  You can't tell me that the success of your group's exping would be ruined by you sitting down for 5 seconds, memming a spell, taking 5 more seconds to cast it on yourself and a final 5 seconds to mem the original spell.<br>
<br>
You are right, I have not played a sk beyond level 24 or so.  I have played a monk to 50ish and the high end game for monks is FD pulling/splitting.  If an item is going to make another class better than me at something that is the basis for my existence then it needs to be nerfed across the board, plain and simple.  As far as my religion hurting me goes I'm kos in a lot less places than most of the lighties I know. =D <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46578"> Salta </a>

Unfortunately, level 60 spells seem to be a lot rarer in Luclin than they were in Velious, not to mention that the spell can be overwritten by Breeze. *Looks innocent* I'll still get it someday though, I just see myself yelling at younger enchanters &quot;No, you did NOT do me a favour by Breezing me, now leave me alone!&quot;..<br>
<br>
And Gaelron.. you hit the nail on the head, paladins are completely and absolutely useless because they're wishy-washy goody two shoes who can only be weaker races and who usually are too strong willed to be easily bent into submission (with a few exceptions.. hi Arclight!).  That's why paladins stink. *Poke* Doesn't have anything to do with their good tanking ability, nice healing, Lay on Hands' emergency potential, and buffing power.  They still suck!

Dont have kodiac's yet and I dont actually know anyone who does so I left it out of the picture since it's not a common occurrence so far.  It actually looks to be the only useful buff we could use the AE effect on since it's the only group buff that lasts longer than 72 minutes.<br>
<br>
As far as those overwriting by lesser buff spells go I surely do hope that gets fixed soon.  It's so frustrating to get the circle of seasons cast on me (+55fr/cr) only to have someone else in group trying to get their cr/fr by getting CoW/CoS cast on them.<br>
<br>
I wonder if kodiac's works like group c2 where if you try and cast it on a greenie it will be too powerful but if you cast it on yourself w/ the greenie in your group they get the spell to take hold on them.  Something just seems wrong when you can have level 10 wizards running around w/ c2 for 150 minutes. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46578"> Salta </a>

As it is I have an easier time splitting mobs with snare and FD than they do FDing 20 times. Although they'll always be wanted for the obnoxious amount of damage they do.<br>
When it comes down to it the only things that SKs are truly good at is taunting and dueling, neither of which get you far =p.<br>
I don't know the 2hs sword from Hate you mentioned but I thought the 1hs was useable by fatties. I have only been able to think of one crappy BP that is fatty only but there's quite a few items that we can't use, granite spaulders being the one that bugs me the most. I really can't think of anything that's ever been put in the game to specifically help fatties. I think a lot of our problem is the PvP servers, they don't want to give SKs anything usefull because they'd be too powerful in duels so we all pay the price. Before you all say SKs suck in duels remember that quite a while ago now they nerfed the damage our HT does against PCs. My HT is getting close to 1400pts of instant damage, that will take a serious chunk out of anyone that isn't buffed and could almost kill some casters outright. <p>"I'm not going to lie, I'll not be a gentleman.

Allow me to go over the wizard ones briefly<br>
<br>
1. Quick Evacuation- Reduces evac casting time.. <br>
-useless usually.. May save lives<br>
2. Exodus- Free instant group evac<br>
-useful for emergency situations<br>
3. Quick damage- Reduces casting time on nukes greater than  4 seconds.. -very useful for a lvl60 wizard...<br>
4. Manaburn- Channels all mana into a  10 second unresistable nuke..  Rumored to do around 7k dd<br>
-Mostly useless unless you want to finish off a mob for exp or may have uses against Kunark dragons<br>
5. Improved familiar-makes familiars immune to spells.. Finally can use familiar in ToV and AEing situations<br>
6. Nexus gate.. a free gate to nexus for 0 mana..<br>
-useless<br>
7. Spell casting fury mastery.. increased Crits on nukes<br>
-useful but disappointing that its in class abilities<br>
8. Strong Root- casts a lure like root<br>
-useless unless its an emergency.<br>
<br>
The only ones i really like a quick damage and exodus.. <br>
<br>
Ok maybe Necros beat paladins in duels but its more important how good the dueler is than the class.. <br>
<br>
PALADIN POWER!.. you forget one of the moderators of this board is a paladin heh.. Ban Val! =p <p><center>
