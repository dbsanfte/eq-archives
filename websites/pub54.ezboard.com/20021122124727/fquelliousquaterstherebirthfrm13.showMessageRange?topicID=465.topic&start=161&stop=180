<br>
The ragefire camp cannot be compared to any other camp in EQ because it's drops are one of the most precious, but the access to it is both easy and its not a tough mob to kill.  <br>
<br>
If anyone remotely thinks about KSing it, I would hate to find out what the repurcussions are especially when some of the largest/more powerful guilds support it.  <br>
<br>
Whether Verant supports this or not is completely irrelevant, that reputation will stick with the guild for ages.  <br>
<br>
Rules are there to be bent or taken as player perspective in EQ, I am happy to say that Quellious is one of the more amenable servers and we generally work things out between us.  <br>

Hence, her guilds support for this.  I am not sure about RiP's guild leader, but i know alot of there members support it and they have a cleric on the list.  Alot of the uber guilds dont care about epics anyways, people that recruit with them already have their epic.<br>

Couple years ago I believe. QQ reservation system ring a bell? LC and VM? The fact that it turned out for the best just shows that the minority isn't always bad!<br>
<br>
As for the list, who knows. I think it's good in a way because it allows some people who otherwise liekly would never get their epic to have a chance. It also forces clerics who could bring in forces at any time to wait. <br>
<br>
Let's look at it like this. I know at least a couple of LC clerics aren't on the list because they don't have time to camp Rage like that. Now let's say you get rid of the list, one of them is on, and Rage pops. Maybe you are camping him. If we know he popped (and make no mistake, the big guilds would know if it was in their best interests), what are the odds you are getting your piece from Rage that day, assuming we decide we want to take him? VM and Wraith could do the same easily.  <br>
<br>
Would that be a bad thing? Maybe, maybe not. At least we would be out of your way right? <br>
<br>
Finally, take this how you want. if it comes off as arrogant...well, tough shit. I think enough of you know me that it won't surprise you. If my guildleader isn't too good to make use of this list, and park her cleric in Skyfire for weeks, then you damn sure aren't too good for it.<br>
<br>
This is all my opinion. Dunno how the rest of LC feels about the list n stuff. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1965">Tattle</a><br>Quellious<br>

[I am going to recommend that my Guild not follow this list. If two or more clerics want to camp rage then it can be petitioned or go by what ever the correct Vernant sanctioned rules are]<br>
<br>
Can I ask for a clarification of this statement, by saying that you recommend that your guild not &quot;follow the list&quot; one could erroniously assume you mean that your guild plans to gank Ragefire, is this correct? <p><a

<br>
   To start off alot of these threat post are just ignorant most of you didnt read correctly and just started rambling. And I do agree all the Anger/Threats come from the ones who oppose change. The list is a joke, it isnt fair for ANYONE including the people on it... Ill remind everyone FREEDOM COMES WITH INSECURITY.. Best way to put it , this camp should be free. No more communism (LoL) , This shouldnt be for a exlcusive group that got on the list first, I have sat at that spawn with friends s/he was waiting there with 2 AFK Clerics -- The cleric that was next on the list wasnt there, Is there any way you can justify this ? I cant come with one. The list system DOESNT work , not one bit and to brush it off as 'This is the best we can do for now' , I reply without the list is better then what we are doing now, The freedom to go into the camp as you like and camp it your 6 hours and see if he comes up not be excluded from the camp for months because you werent in that exclusive group. For those who say It would still take 6-12months.. Well atleast those 6-12 months you will have a fighting chance, you wont be waiting. Yinta is completely right and Iam backing her 100percent Not only because she has presented her self and showed everyone respect with a well presented arguement but when I turned 46 and was Plane Raid ready there was the QQ system telling me I could step foot in a plane till next year i was crushed , and I THANK the members of Vis who Plane Crashed and destroyed the faulty reservation system  <br>
 allowing me to plane raid, and for those who had to go thru the old QQ rule you KNOW for a fact that its MUCH better now then it ever was . Freedom to raid and have chance for every spawn in the game is the only way to do it. So I Say with everyone who agrees with me and the otehrs Please POST your thoughts and lets work together civily to put a end to this list.  If you want to defend against anything I said please be Civil if it shows apparently your not Ill skip it and your point wont even be effected. Thanks for your time , See you all in EQ . )<br>

<br>
I won't add to this debate - everything has been said - over and over and over and over again.  This subject has been beaten to death.  To those of you out there who only look for negative things to say about the clerics in SF - well - so be it - I assume you are that way in Real life also - always looking for the negative!  I feel nothing but sympathy for you then. Try channeling all that negativity into something positive . . . WOW what a concept that would be <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I choose to look for the positive in everything around me - always have - always will. Notice I said CHOOSE.  Everyone out there can choose how they view what the clerics are doing in SF.  Bad - good - whichever - it is your choice. <br>
<br>
But think of this - I have witnessed more than 5 Ragefire battles now - and in each case - no matter the time of day - no matter the guild that is represented on Cleric Hill - a formidable force has been called into place within &quot;minutes&quot; of Rage's entrance. <br>
<br>
Say what you will friends - but witness the power of the clerics when they band together - in friendship - and comradery - regardless of Guild affiliations. Perfect?  Not Perfect?  - it's your choice -  but step back - and look around you friends . . . and see what is happening out there in SkyFire - you may be surprised <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Look around you friends . .while you are all here spewing all the reasons why this CAN'T happen -  the Clerics are actually out there in SF  - DOING - what they say.  Somehow I find humor in this situation. <br>
<br>
hmmm . . . taxes, politics, religion, and now Ragefire <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that non main characters are on the list, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Of the clerics ON the list some are main and some are not.  As a Main,  I don't have a problem with it.  I dont recall seeing any discussion of it on the quellious cleric boards.    <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that certain guilds seem to be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> overly represented</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on the list, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Emphasis mine, but the above is an opinion. but there IS the requirement that no guild can go back to back... <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that getting on the list is a political exercise, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not political as far a I can see.  There have been a couple incidents that I'm aware of that people did nto get on the list when they thought  they should have.  I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> beleive</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that the recent cases occurred in a  single cyle and were attributed to the alt player not telling the actual player about folks that requested to be added.. and the secondary cleric was asleep or afk at the time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that no consideration is given for having completed other steps of the epic<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
At one time the quest was completly linear. Can't do step N until you complete step N-1.    With the move of Ragefire outta Nagafen's lair, that linear requirement was removed.    Since Verant doesn't have the requirement, I'd actually think they'd frown on any attempt to add an additional requirmeent.<br>
<br>
Btw - do &quot;the server warriors&quot; require that a warrior have the hand of maestro before getting the blade from the queen of Chardok?  Are you barred from getting the green scale until you get the blade from Sky?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that the list creation was controlled by a few individuals on the server, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
not disputed.  I think it was 4 at the time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that the list is controlled by a few individuals on the server, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yup, a few individuals.  2 to be exact.  The list is controlled by the sitting cleric and the second cleric.  THEY add new folsk to the list.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
that stacking of friends and guildmates on the list has been perpetrated by those that control it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, an opinion,   Other than that, if a freind of mine asks me (when the time comes)  &quot;Where are you?&quot;  and I say &quot;I'm one of the clerics camping Ragefire.&quot; I suppose they might  ask how to get on the list (if they're interested).  And I'll tell them  &quot;come see us in SKyfire.&quot;   Is this wrong?  Remember - the sitting cleric and his second add folks to the list. That means they're from 2 guilds (or one is unaffiliated)<br>
<br>
Lets see -I think I refuted one or two -  confirmed one or two - called a couple opinions where we differ. <br>

Thats tagentel to what I said in the first place. What was said was *all* the big guilds were for the list - I pointed out this wasnt the case and made it clear that there were at least some in lotus cult as well as the other two guilds I listed - that are against your scheme - that fact hasnt changed, and no amount of waffleing around the subject has changed that.<br>
<br>
 Its been said before and obviously it needs to be said again - no cleric has to subscribe to your list. If they get a raid force to the rage spawn before you gathering your list forces - rage is their's and verant will back them on that. At best if two (or more) raids are present a GM will make you roll for it - so all this is totally hot air. Rage is FFA whether you like it or not. It just so happens that at least recently there hasnt been an issue with it. Most of the guilds who have the capacity to gather for rage quickly couldnt care less about petty threats either.<br>

This is what I am seeing....<br>
<br>
Some clerics are not allowed on the list after asking, is this an oversite?  If so, then the &quot;list&quot; is faulty.<br>
<br>
Some clerics have the Ragefire piece sitting in bank?  This is assinine, this list should serve clerics that are down to that last piece, it makes me wonder how many Ragefire pieces are sitting in the bank of an individual that has quit the game, moved to Stormhammer, been banned, etc.<br>
<br>
This list is not known by all, regardless of what some of these posters are saying.  No one on Quellious is informed to peruse through &quot;Quellious Quarters&quot; for current server news.  When I pass thru Skyfire, all I hear is &quot;RF is camped by soandso and guild soandso&quot;.  No mention of a list was made.<br>
<br>
What happens if a person on the list has RF pop and not enough force to deal with it?  It despawns?  (I do not want to read up on the rules for the list, but I keep seeing comments about RF despawns in previous posts, has anyone considered this possibility?)<br>
<br>
I think the person who came up with the list did it with good intentions, but because more and more guilds are aware of this list, the list grows rediculously long.  I see many possible ways to exploit this now.  And I think some have taken advantage of the list to get their epic piece way too soon.<br>
<br>
Yinta's post is not about flames, but asking for alternatives, now that this &quot;list&quot; is showing flaws in the system.<br>
<br>
Personally, I like the guild instead of cleric idea.  I'm sure all clerics like this idea as well, but again, it leaves room for possible exploits.  (ex. using a newly created twink to get the epic piece for future use).<br>
<br>
I would like this list if ...<br>
<br>
1)  It were reserved to level 60 clerics, since they worked hard getting to this point.  I know this is too harsh for many to accept.  Just my God given right to an opinion.<br>
<br>
2)  Cleric proves (how?  Any ideas?) that this is the last piece they need at the time they sign on the list.<br>
<br>
3)  The guild can hold the reservation for said cleric only (If we could make sure the said cleric will loot the dropped epic piece, but how do we know?)<br>
<br>
This is my idea of a list, but as you see, it still has flaws, so it looks like the old method of what Verant supports all along is the only solution.<br>
<br>
Again, I repeat, the list is working, but who is it working for and against?<br>
