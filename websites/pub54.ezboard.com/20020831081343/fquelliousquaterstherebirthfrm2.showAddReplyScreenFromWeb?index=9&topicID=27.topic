If you are going to wander in that region beware of the Ry`Gorr orcs and Kromrif giants. The orcs and giants have an alliance and are at war against the Coldain. The dwarves actually built their city in a mountainside and is hidden behind a waterfall to prevent invasion by the frost giants.&quot; The ranger reached for an unused piece of parchment and quill, and drew a rough map as she explained how to access the city.<br>
<br>
~~~<br>
<br>
The Dragon Portal of the Great Divide.<br>
<br>
A tear in the fabric of time and space opened up and allowed the Feir`Dal ranger, the Koada`Dal wizard, and half elven druid to appear within the obsidian ring. Millikin habitually turned and looked up at the statue of the dragon guardian. After an exchange of coin and word of thanks, the druid traced a rectangular pattern in midair and vanished in a swirl of mist. <br>
<br>
The biting chill wind was the first thing to grab Shiobahn's attention as she examined the landscape. For as far as the eye could see was snow, looming black cliffsides or mountain peaks. She pulled her cloak closer around her form and followed Millikin's direction in the south.<br>
<br>
&quot;The mad sorceror Velketor makes his lair in one of the caves that way. The Coldain say he sometimes kidnaps their people for experiments and even his own people, the Kromzek spurn him. I've explored the caves a bit. He has golem constructs and gargoyles guarding the entrances to his castle. Mostly I've encountered giant spiders or kobolds there though. There's also whispers of a dissident sect of Coldain making a hideout in the caves out here. I've not had the chance to confirm that as of yet though.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It sounds as if you've gotten involved in the politics of the Coldain, Cousin. Despite your experiences in Freeport.&quot; Shiobahn smiled to the ranger.<br>
<br>
Millikin shrugged slightly. &quot;They are at war with the those who encroach upon the Tunarean Court. 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' I suppose you could say. And Thurgadin, our destination, is due north. Barring any accidents or delays, we should reach the city in an hour or so. It gets cold out here at night.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the two headed north, the ranger continued her discourse of the local inhabitants and creatures of the area and how to best combat or avoid them. Shardwurms roamed near the mountain peaks near their lairs within and seemed to blend into the background with their white scales. Until they unleashed their chilling breath weapon. The primitive yaklike humanoid tizmak made their home in a network of caves in the western mountain sides. Feral kodiaks wandered the eastern and southern mountain range. Finally Shiobahn saw the outline of a Coldain guard tower near a river and faintly heard the roar of a waterfall. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a shadowy outline rushing towards them...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umillikinerreene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Millikin Erreene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Arrowbringer </span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/1/02 3:09:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Curse</span><hr size=1> Trip to Third Gate (Another Interlude)<br>
<br>
  &quot;Milli, I kind of need your help with something.&quot;  The half elven rogue known to most as Corvariel Nytewisp ran his fingers through his hair and smiled his most charming smile to the Feir`Dal ranger who was perched on the roof of the Hidden Inn in East Commonlands.<br>
<br>
  &quot;With what?&quot;  Millikin called from her vantage point.  She noticed two orcs carrying a wooden crate from one of their encampments.  The sight had apparently become a commonplace occurrence lately from Clan Deathfist and she had decided to find out what was going on.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You remember that wonderful spear you gave me awhile back.  From Luclin?&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &quot;Mmm hmm.&quot;  Millikin replied, her attention had focused on the Freeport Militia guard that was patrolling nearby.  One of the orcs approached him.  Though too far away to hear, Millikin was perceptive enough to realize that a conversation of some sort was taking place.  Then suddenly the guard drew his sword and ran the orc through.  This was not totally unexpected but the fact that the guard had even entertained a parley with the Deathfist was what piqued the ranger's curiosity.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well, I lost it.&quot;  Corvariel paused for dramatic effect before continuing.  &quot;Somewhere in Neriak.&quot;  He leaned against the wall and waited.  Millikin froze at the last statement then jumped from the roof in front of Corvariel.<br>
<br>
  &quot;What in the Nine Hells were you doing in Neriak.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Truth be told he was attempting to pilfer from one of the guildmasters, but he wasn't about to tell Millikin that.  He knew she took a dim view of stealing as a rule.  He smiled once again.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I was uhm -- sightseeing.  Yes.  I'd never been to Neriak before and thought since I was passing by I may as well go ahead and check it out.  Anyway, I was minding my own business but apparently a few of the dark elves didn't much care for my dropping in unannounced.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Uh huh.&quot;  Millikin looked straight at him.  If that wasn't the wateriest lie she'd ever heard in her life, it certainly ranked up in the top five.  Nonetheless Corvariel smiled again at her as if to say 'That's my story and I'm sticking with it.'<br>
<br>
  &quot;Where about did you lose it?&quot;  Millikin sighed, foreseeing a trip to Neriak in her immediate future.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I believe the sign said Third Gate.&quot;  Corvariel stated innocently.  Millikin stared at him.  While she was not familiar with the city firsthand, it was a well known fact that the Third Gate was the heart of Neriak where the rich and powerful lived.  And that included their clergy and practitioners of the dark arts.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Just sightseeing, huh?&quot;  A touch of sarcasm laced Millikin's remark.  &quot;So tell me, did this tour entail visiting the palace of their queen?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Oh nothing so grandiose.  Just their training hall for rogues.  Of course I couldn't pass by and not look in.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Of course not.&quot;  Millikin remarked caustically as the two headed towards the tunnel that led to Nektulos Forest.<br>
<br>
~~~~~<br>
<br>
Making it past the city gate sentries was not overly difficult for either the ranger or rogue but moving silently and unnoticed through an entire city without the use of magic was more difficult.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You could probably use your invisibility spell here -- &quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Camouflage.&quot;  Millikin interrupted.  &quot;Spellcasters use invisibility.  Rangers and druids use camouflage.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot;  Corvariel dismissed the remark.  &quot;As I was saying, it may not be a good idea to cast spells deeper in the city.  They have a lot of spellcasters that might pick up on it.  I just need you to get rid of anyone that might see us.  Maybe toss their bodies in the water or whatever.&quot;<br>
<br>
Corvariel moved towards the stone bridge that sloped down and led into a checkpoint tower.  Millikin grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled him back to whisper (somewhat loudly) in his ear.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;You know, it is activities of that sort which invite retaliation.  While you may not care overmuch, I'd prefer that Kelethin and Felwithe not turn into a site for assassination games.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;If they see you they'll kill you.&quot;  Corvariel added.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Then I'll deal with them then.  But this is their home and we're asking for trouble by coming here.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yaa, fine then.  When you get past the checkpoint go right and make a sharp turn left.  Before you get to the fountain, turn right and head down that passage and stop at the pool.  I'll meet you there.  Don't go much further as there's a guardhouse nearby and the city commons area has a series of portcullis gates to deter intruders and invaders.  The guards control the opening and shutting of those gates.&quot;<br>
<br>
Millikin nodded at the directions and sprinted down the slope and past the check point.  The guards standing at either side either took no notice of her or saw the eldritch lightning coursing through the sword blades in either hand and instantly decided that they would not interfere unless a general alarm was sounded.  Millikin paused at the water fountain just before she could resume in the direction Corvariel had outlined previously, a single guard had come around the corner from one of the shops further down the path.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You there.  Stop!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Millikin paid no heed to the demand to halt and continued along the twisted passageways until she stood at a ledge that overlooked a pool of water.  As she walked down the incline towards the tunnel mouth on the opposite side of the pool, Corvariel waved from the tunnel and began talking quietly.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The guardhouse is up ahead.  There's two you'll see at the far end and two offices at the other end of the main portcullis gate.  One or two guards are in either tower.  But there's two towers across from then that you can't see because they'll be behind us as we approach.  There's usually a guard or two inside those as well.  Once you're past the main portcullis and in the courtyard there are smaller once to either the left or right.  We want to head left this time.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ten guards?&quot;  Millikin inquired.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Uh ... eleven actually.&quot;  I forgot.  There is one who wanders.  He patrols the outskirts of the commons areas and he'll come up close to here then turn back and continue his circuit.  They raise and lower the portcullis for him.  He's the captain of the watchguard or whatever.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Are you sure you know what you're talking about?  Capt. N`Farre is the captain of the guard and he was outside at the gate earlier.&quot;  Millikin looked at Corvariel and her eyes narrowed slightly.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The guard's nobody with any kind of rank really.  He's just in charge over here.  See, here he comes now.&quot;  Millikin heard the clinking of chains and looked up as Corvariel pointed as a dark elf guard in red trimmed silver armor headed their way.  The visor of his helm was pulled down as he strode purposely towards them.  Elf and half-elf alike stepped back into the shadows of the tunnel and suddenly the Teir`Dal did a sharp about-face and marched in the other direction.<br>
<br>
  &quot;We need to move now while the portcullis is up.&quot;  Corvariel suddenly took off running before Millikin could say another word.  Millikin quickened her pace when suddenly the guard they had seen earlier turned around suddenly.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Intruder!&quot;  In a blur of motion the dark elf drew his sword and sliced an overhead arc for Millikin's head.  A guard looked out from the tower and moved towards her.  The ranger brought her left sword, Earthcaller, up to block the swing and twisted her wrist as if to hilt punch the guard with Swiftwind, and the last moment, she snapped the edge of her blade towards his neck and pulled back, slashing his neck.  The Teir`Dal body's stiffened and his sword clattered to the ground as he fell.<br>
<br>
One of the guards called out as two of them advanced on the ranger.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You're that filthy Tunarean ranger&quot;  The guard who had spoken smashed his shield towards her face and caused her to stagger back a step while the other moved to try and flank her.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I'm not filthy.&quot;  The guard suddenly slumped over as one of Corvariel's throwing knives found itself imbedded between his ribs.  He was standing on the other side of the portcullis.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Stop playing around, Milli.&quot;  She didn't notice the two corpses slumped against the wall.  One had his throat slit and the other had a sliver of metal shoved right under his fifth rib<br>
<br>
  &quot;Close the gates!&quot;  One of the guards had the presence of mind to call out and the rattling of chains was heard.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Much as I'd love to stay for a dance or two...&quot; Millikin ducked a swing aimed for her head by her flanking guard and spun sideways to avoid a sword thrust aimed for her heart by a guard who had arrived at the alarm call.  &quot;I must be off.  Another night perhaps.&quot;  The ranger ran towards the lowering gates and dove for the ground, sliding just beyond the portcullis as it slammed into place.  She quickly stood up and dusted herself off, spitting dirt out of her mouth in the process.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I wonder if this is what they mean by the saying everyone eats a pinch of dirt sometime in their life.&quot;  Corvariel smirked at her.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You may find yourself under six feet of dirt sooner than later.  Particularly once they get that portcullis back up.&quot;  Both heard the tell-tale creaking of chains to indicate it was being raised.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Right.  Lets go.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two ran down streets and alleyways of the commons section of Neriak and into the section called Third Gate.  A general alarm had been sounded and Neriak's guards were marching through the streets searching for them.  The two ducked into an abandoned building for a few hours until the ruckus about their presence died down.  Sitting down crosslegged behind some crates Millikin closed her eyes, while Corvariel paced near a window, peeking out occasionally.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You just had to be seen didn't you.&quot;  Corvariel whispered.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Not intentionally.  Besides, it was your idea to rush the gate, not mine.  And you're the reason I'm here in the first place.&quot;  Millikin responded complacently.  As had become habit, she reached up to make sure her medicine pouch was still around her neck, then stood up.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yeah yeah.&quot;  Corvariel grumbled.  &quot;Anyhow, when we get to the training hall.  Just invis us and...<br>
<br>
  &quot;Camouflage.&quot;  Millikin corrected.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Whatever ... and I'll poke around until I find my spear.  You wait outside the hall.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;If you get caught stealing or something I am NOT going to help you.&quot;  Millikin looked at him dubiously.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;Me?  Steal?  I'm hurt you'd make such an accusation of me.  I just want to get my spear back.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two made their way towards the thieves guild.  And once the cantra was recited to render them invisible, Corvariel skipped up the steps unseen.  For her part, Millikin paced back and forth outside, stopping only once to inspect the statues in the front of the guildhall, with mild distaste.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Run!&quot;  Suddenly Millikin caught sight of Corvariel tearing out of the hall, his spear gripped in his hand.  Two dark elves were not far behind, weapons drawn.  She whispered another druidic cantra and one of the dark elves slowed his step.  He turned towards her cursing but she quickly ran after Corvariel.  She readied her bow and nocked an arrow, taking careless aim at his other pursuer.  The first shot missed but the second arrow hit him in the leg.  She lost sight of the rogue after the second shot and ducked down another alleyway.  Millikin was not surprised to see him near the city entrance gates on her way out.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I got what I came for.&quot;  He grinned at her, spear in hand.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I bet you did.&quot;  She looked at him suspiciously.<br>
<br>
  &quot;What?&quot;  Corvariel took a tone of feigned slight.  &quot;Here I was going to thank you and all and you accuse me of having an ulterior motive.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;I haven't accused you of anything yet.&quot;  Millikin looked at him.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well, nonetheless, thank you anyway.  It means a lot to me.&quot;  Corvariel added deciding it best not press the issue to raise the ranger's suspicions right away.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You're welcome.  I think.  Until, later, Corv.&quot;  That said, the ranger transformed into a dark furred wolf and ran into the Nektulos Forest.<br>

&quot;When I came to this place of smooth evil, I understood the powers of the mind better than most men.  Black skies and white water ran across the beast's back. I could use its hidden abilities to touch others, read minds, and change the way they twisted.&quot;  -- Vlanic Kroskos<br>
<br>
<br>
  &quot;Faer mri' kul.&quot;  Raven Yadan swept into her study and raised a single hand in completion of a spell.  A silvery mist outlined the doors and windows of the room, preventing them from being casually opened by anyone, save the spellcaster.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;Good bye, Raven.&quot;  The enchanter discarded the trappings she wore to detail her disguise as her facial features became more angular and her ear tips more pointed.  Her skin darkened as the enchanter reverted to her natural form.  She set the spectacles on the table before her and sat down in an elaborately carved chair.  If the enchanter was inclined to gloat over her accomplishments, (Which is not to say she doesn't.) she would have reflected over how swiftly she learned of this journal's existence and how she legitimately obtained it.  <br>
<br>
The one eyed old human with two raven pets struck her as somewhat senile at first when she overheard him discussing an enchanter's journal one evening with another companion.  Nonetheless she listened, both in amusement and in the hopes that perhaps he may know something else of value.  Then he mentioned that the book was all but forgotten in the library of a sage in Felwithe who died recently.  The man had a half-brained scheme to steal the book but wasn't sure he could pull it off.  An idea quickly took shape in the enchanter's mind and she parted company.  It did not take her long to verify that the claims of a sage's death were indeed true.  The enchanter quickly created a persona and chose the name in homage of the two preternaturally intelligent birds and mockery of their owner.  She concocted a story about the journal belonging to a deceased relative who knew the sage when he was younger.  The sage's family was content to let her take the journal, thinking it little more than the personal diary of a human spellcaster.<br>
<br>
As it was though, the enchanter gave no further thought to the old man or his birds, only to what content of a forgotten book in Felwithe's archives could possibly be of interest to him.  She opened the journal and began to read...<br>
<br>
Hours later, she closed the book.  The implications in the journal were unexpected to be sure and if they proved to be true, the power she stood to gain would be remarkable.  Some of the spell research was incomplete or experiments were flawed but the former would be corrected with some modifications to the latter.  The only thing the enchanter needed was a suitable test subject.  Someone who's existence was inconsequential to her long term plans and meaningless to the people she currently threw in her lot with as she did not want to risk alienating them for the time being.  She opened the journal again to reread the requirements of the spell, already someone in mind, she began mentally formulating her experiment procedure. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uautumncrescendo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Autumn Crescendo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Auty the Primadonna</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/14/02 3:16:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=27.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Curse</span><hr size=1> Great Divide - <br>

  Despite the enchantment of a magical skin Shiobahn was slapped to the side by a large paw that nearly encompassed half of her torso.  The second slap hit her and again though unscathed by her shielding it did not stop her from getting a bit dazed.  It would break through in a few more hits, but what was it.  Pulling herself up from the deep snow that bogged the pass, her eyes lifted to face her assailant, and she was face to face with the Kodiak.  Its eyes gleamed with raw fury, and its claws were in full extension from its paws, and again it tried mauling and maiming in large swinging strokes, a third and fourth glancing off her shield.  <br>
<br>
  Millikin was swift on the scene; she knew this type of combat was not one her cousin would last in.  Shiobahn was uttering the words to shackle the beast while dodging blows, and just as the spell took off Millikin was in control.  Energy crackled from the duel blades she wielded and she went into a fast and furious combat, the beast scarcely landing a solid hit on the nimble elf.  Shiobahn regained her composure as swiftly as she could, reaching her arms out as she called upon the power of the elements and invoked them into a fiery rain pelting down upon the Kodiak in waves.  Before she could even utter another spell though the beast was run through and crumpled to the ground.<br>
<br>
  Millikin gave a quick assessment of her cousin, assuring that there was nothing more than minor damage to be had.  Her eyes scanned down either side of the pass before falling more particularly on the snow.  Her tracking skills were keen and she wanted to make certain that their attacker had been alone.  Satisfied he was simply a wanderer she glanced back at her cousin.  <br>
<br>
"Perhaps you will want to use a shield of invisibility until we are safely at the city lines."<br>
<br>
Shiobahn nodded in agreement, glanced around a moment with some trepidation, then withdrew her spell book flipping with haste to the area she had her invisibility spell marked.  It took but a second to refresh the incantation to her mind before she felt certain enough to cast it.  Her fingers traced a series of runes in the air and in a moment she was cloaked in the stealth of invisibility.  <br>
<br>
"I am ready."  Shiobahn murmured to her cousin.<br>
<br>
"This way then."  Millikin gave a small tilt of her head to indicate direction before again into the snow.<br>
<br>
  Shiobahn marveled at how many people she saw in a mimicked fashion, skirting in the shadows of invisibility with her.  She touched the slim bone hoop earring Quasqueton had brought her as a gift from his travels, the enchantment allowing her the sight to spot those hiding in the folds of invisibility.  It was good to know she was not so alone as she lurked in the cold wastes.  The frozen stream caught her attention ahead.  The water was crisp and an icy blue, and the sounds of the waterfall that kept it moving came into hearing distance.  Curving around the river they ended up at the base of the falls and Millikin turned to regard her cousin.<br>
<br>
"Follow me around back, we will go behind the falls."  She called out over the heavy rush of water.<br>
<br>
"Behind?  This is what you spoke of when you mentioned their protection from the Giants, yes?"<br>
<br>
  Millikin nodded then slipped behind the falls, and passing by the guards that held the outposts at the front of the city.  Shiobahn scampered behind the waterfall as well and blinked coming into site of the Dwarves.  She was raised not so far from the city of Kaladim, and these Dwarves looked nothing like the ones of her homelands.  Their skin was so pale it was near transparent coming from years of never seeing the sun.  Their features were harsher, and more chiseled, almost a reflection of the world that surrounded them.  It was after a series of gates that the two parted ways.  A brief discussion on where the basic essentials could be found took place.<br>
<br>
"Be safe cousin, and good luck finding Quas…"  Shiobahn gave the ranger a quick embrace.<br>
<br>
"Thank you."  Millikin murmured, taken aback by the affection of her cousin.  "I should not have too much trouble finding him, he leaves a trail of disaster in his wake."<br>
<br>
"I know, isn't it fantastic?"  Shiobahn beamed.<br>
<br>
"I will never understand wizards…"  Millikin muttered as she walked off in search of a few fletching supplies for the road.<br>

By nightfall she had reached the Eastern Wastes and the temperature was dropping rapidly.  Millikin looked at the rapidly darkening sky, a storm was approaching.  She smiled grimly to herself as she made her way to a Coldain shelter she knew was nearby.  An explosion and flash of orange light caught her attention.  The aroma of burning flesh and charred fur assailed her sense of smell and made her eyes water.<br>
<br>
The ranger quickly headed in that direction.  On occasion she saw the corpses of tundra kodiaks, dire wolves, orc scouts, even a snow griffin.  She sighed inwardly as she knelt down and inspected the snow for tracks.  None were visible, which means the perpetrator was most likely a spellcaster.  Why didn't people make use of the remains?  Corpses tended to attract scavengers.  Soon the snow was falling faster and the wind grew louder so that she almost didn't hear the approaching Kromrif.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Die Outlander!&quot;  The sight of forged velium flashed before her and ripped through the chain mesh tunic she wore, spilling blood on the white snow in front of her.  The ranger fell backwards and immediately rolled sideways to avoid the follow-up strike.  In moments she was on her feet, weapons drawn, a healing cantra passed her lips and the wounds immediately began to close.  Millikin circled behind the Kromrif as he turned with a slashing arc towards her.  In a blur of motion, she ran between his legs and slashed at the back of his knees.  The giant howled in fury and lashed out with his fist to connect with a solid crunch to her back as she ran in front of him.  The ranger stumbled a few paces and spun around in time to block his weapon thrust and counterblow to his elbow with Swiftwind.  The giant was wielding a dagger, but the blade was long enough to be considered a short sword by the elf's estimation.  The Kromrif scout swung his foot sideways to sweep the elf to the ground and was mildly surprised to see she only staggered slightly.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;By Rallos, you are more resilient than I expected, Outlander.  Mayhap there is a place for you alive as a servant.&quot;  The giant bantered as he saw the outline of the ranger backing away, he could hear her breath was ragged and grinned thinking this encounter would be over all too soon.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I've no intention of finding out.&quot;  Swords still in hand, the elven ranger traced a sigil in midair.  Magical energy coalesced briefly then flickered out.  Somehow she had miscast the spell.  &quot;Valdayana's thrice damned curse.&quot;  She sighed again.  Swiftly wiping her blades and sheathing them, Millikin turned and ran relying on the darkness from the approaching storm for cover.  The giant quickly followed, though his vision was not as good as the elf's.  The protective enchantment the ranger had enabling her to regenerate from injuries at an accelerated rate without calling upon a healing cantra would fade soon.  She quickly pulled herself up into the branches of a tree and readied her bow.  Soon she saw the Kromrif's outline and took aim.  The arrow tore through the giant's chest and he staggered.  He reached for the piece of wood and ripped it out, cursing.  The arrowhead was barbed.  Another arrow found itself imbedded in his shoulder and a third grazed his temple.  Hastily the giant turned and ran.  Millikin watched his departure as she dropped down from the tree more intent on finding cover from the approaching storm than giving chase.  She smelled smoke from a nearby campfire, and unless she was hopelessly lost she was fairly sure that Garadain Glacierbane's encampment wasn't too far away.  She headed in that direction.<br>
<br>
~~~~~<br>
<br>
The Kromrif scout grumbled as he made his way back to Kael Drakkel, limping and bleeding.  Far too many outlanders of late have been seen in the area and working with the Coldain.  And the fact that he had been bested by one would not be viewed favorably by Sergeant Tellsren.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Kromrif.  I want a few words with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Eh?&quot;  The giant turned around and looked down to see a small framed creature hidden beneath a hooded travel cloak and his brow furrowed.  Another outlander.  The person was armed with a stave of some sort, he couldn't quite make out the details.  His first thought was to step on the person and move on, hoping this one's death would salvage his reputation somewhat after his defeat at the hands of the Feir`Dal.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The ranger you fought earlier.  Her blood is still on your weapon, no?&quot;  <br>
<br>
The giant glanced down at the dagger in his hand.  The blood was slowly drying on the velium blade.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes.  What of it?&quot;  The giant rumbled, tightening the grip on the hilt in anticipation of challenge.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I require that elf's blood.&quot;  The speaker spoke quietly.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Then get it from her yourself, Outlander.&quot;  The Kromrif sneered.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I do not have the time for such menial activities.&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &quot;You mean you lack the ability to get it from her.  Begone, before I crush your bones to dust.  You've wasted enough of my time.&quot;   The frost giant turned and headed down the ramp to Kael, ignoring the arcane syllables carried on the wind when suddenly he stopped.<br>
<br>
  &quot;On second thought ... here.&quot;  The Kromrif scout handed the dagger to the stranger. <br>
<br>
  &quot;Bel' la dos.&quot;  A faint note of ironic humor laced the speaker's tone as she whispered an arcane phrase and vanished from sight.<br>

<br>
Authors:  Autumnwyld Crescendo (pseudonymn) and Millikin Erreene (pseudonymn)<br>
<br>
<br>
Millikin poked her head out from the tunnel that led down to Siren's Grotto and looked around, though her clothing had long since dried from her swim through the grotto waterways, she still shivered reflexively.  The freezing winds were biting and there were not many architectural structures or arboreal features to serve as a windbreak out in the Western Wastes.  Millikin whispered a few words and her features contorted as shaggy cinnamon colored fur grew from her body.  Her teeth elongated and were noticeably sharper as she dropped down to all fours, the transformation into a dire wolf complete.  She sniffed the tracks she had found in the snow and after detecting the same scent on the wind she ran off in the direction of one of Veeshan's Scars.<br>
<br>
<br>
  &quot;I hate this place.&quot;  Autumnwyld Crescendo repeated for the umpteenth time.  She had spent the past few days tracking and killing the savage velium hounds for their furs.  They had proven to be annoyingly difficult to find.  Adding to her aggravation was the fact that rangers and druids, with their superior understanding of animal behavior and habitats, were often able to locate the dens, hunting territories, and watering holes of these creatures and dispatch them, ofttimes before she could even find one in her vicinity.  The Coldain's ruler, Dain Colin Frostreaver IV had commissioned the creation of fine armor for the Coldain army and anyone capable of meeting the specifications was rewarded handsomely for their efforts.  Quasqueton Fyrestrike was confident he was one of those people and had spent the past few weeks gathering the materials he needed, preparing the parts of the armor short of formally forging the pieces as time and equipment permitted.  Obsessively lost in his work, he was not paying any attention to the bard, then he jabbed his hand with his leather puncher and cursed profusely.  Autumn snickered.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The length of time it takes me to complete this padding impacts how long we stay here.  Hopefully this will be enough.  But if I ruin a pelt I'll need to replace it.&quot;  The silver haired wizard pointed to the silvery white furs stacked near a plethora of tailoring and leatherworking tools scattered around.  &quot;So we can't leave yet.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Alright, alright.&quot;  Autumn sighed and looked around.  She saw a small outline in the distance.  Even after donning the mask to take the appearance of a dark elf with their superior ultravision, she couldn't quite make out the form but it looked like another velium hound on the prowl.  She readied her sword, once more Quasqueton was engrossed in his work and didn't seem to notice her actions.  Singing the song of Selo's, Autumn broke into a run and headed off in that direction.  After following a somewhat circular path, Autumn realized the hound was heading deliberately for Quasqueton, not in the stalker's pace though.  Slowing down, she figured it was likely someone intent on requesting that the wizard transport them somewhere out of this barren wasteland.<br>
<br>
Millikin saw the wizard some distance away and trotted closer.  She quickly noticed that he was leatherworking and waited silently for several moments.  Feeling he was being watched, Quasqueton looked up to see a dire wolf staring at him.  He quickly jumped to his feet and whispered an incantation.  Motes of flame erupted from his fingertips, when he realized the wolf had not attacked and he closed his hand into a fist to quickly dissipate the fiery energy he was gathering in anticipation of an attack.  He studied it closer.  Druids that were capable of surviving out in the Western Wastes usually opted to travel in the guise of a small jet black wolf.  This one was larger and brown.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;May I help you, Ranger?&quot;  Quasqueton queried after a moment.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I have a message for you.  From...&quot;  Millikin paused, still considering the irony.  &quot;your wife.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Shio?  What did she possibly say to persuade you to track me all the way out here?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;She is a kinsman of mine.&quot;  Millikin mentally willed the transformation back into her elven form and reached into her backpack searching for the letter.  &quot;And for most intents and purposes, now so are you.&quot;  She handed him Shiobahn's note as Autumn came up from behind her, still wearing her dark elven disguise.<br>
<br>
  &quot;A family reunion?&quot;  Autumn laughed.  Millikin turned around<br>
  <br>
  &quot;You're still wearing that damned dark elf disguise?&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &quot;Oh hush up, Ranger.  You'd be surprised at how well I can see when using it.&quot;  Autumn quipped.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Why hadn't she mentioned it before?&quot;  Quas took the letter and opened it to read.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I found out Shiobahn was recently married.  The entire prospect is rather frightening to dwell on.&quot;  Millikin replied.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Well, it was somewhat impromptu.&quot;  Quasqueton looked up from the letter.  &quot;Don't worry.  Your cousin is in good hands and capable of fending for herself fairly well.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;I was more concerned about the safety of the general population of Norrath.&quot;  Autumn snickered softly at Millikin's comment.<br>
<br>
  &quot;And just what is THAT supposed to mean?&quot;  Quasqueton huffed.  Millikin glanced northwards, in the direction of the Temple of Veeshan, her thoughts distracted.  &quot;Can I send you somewhere, &quot;cousin&quot;?  He asked, his tone laced with a touch of sarcasm.  Millikin looked at him after a moment.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Just the thought of two fire crazy wizards running loose and working in concert is...&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Frightening.&quot;  Autumn stated deadpan.<br>
<br>
  &quot;... disconcerting.&quot;  Millikin tacked on.  Grinning slightly to Autumn.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I'll be sure to torch a tree or two just for you.&quot;  Quasqueton gazed poignantly at Millikin, his eyes glinted with a trace of humor.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I know of a very large one you can't possibly miss.&quot;  The ranger replied dryly.  &quot;It's called the Earthmelder.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Hrmph.&quot;  Quasqueton sniffed, knowing exactly the &quot;tree&quot; that the ranger was referring to.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;Actually, I don't know if you're familiar with her or not, nor if you keep up with practitioners of enchantment but do you know the Luhtmauyar Valdayana D`Varr?  I've something for her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quasqueton tucked the letter away into a pocket and a sudden rumbling was heard in the distance, indicative that a storm was approaching.<br>
<br>
  &quot;D`Varr?  The name's familiar but I'm fairly sure I haven't met her formally.  Sorry.&quot;  He replied.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Its almost as if she's fallen from the face of Norrath.&quot;  Millikin shook her head.  Snow began to fall at a steady pace and even gave Millikin pause.  Why didn't the animals seek cover beforehand?<br>
<br>
  &quot;It seems almost unnatural.&quot;  She remarked mostly to herself.<br>
<br>
  &quot;If you've a hunch of where she is, I can send you there.  Or close by.&quot;  Quasqueton offered, presuming that Millikin was speaking of the one whom she was searching for. <br>
<br>
  &quot;If you could, the Nexus of Luclin please.  It will be easier to start from there.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;I really hate this place.&quot;  Autumn mumbled.  Quasqueton Fyrestrike gripped his staff and began another incantation, summoning energies to tear through the borders of time and space.  He calmly watched as they gathered around the ranger.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;To the Great Divide, Autumn?&quot;  He paused.  For a brief second the eldritch beams that gathered around the ranger had disjoined but they quickly reformed and then she was gone.<br>

Authors:  Valdayana D`Varr (pseudonym) and Millikin Erreene (pseudonym)<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;No exorciser harm thee!  Nor no witchcraft charm thee!  Ghost unlaid forbear thee!  Nothing ill come near thee!&quot;  <br>
-- William Shakespeare<br>
<br>
<br>
Valdayana D`Varr struck a match and touched the flame to the first candle.  A black hole opened up from the ceiling and eldritch electricity crackled.  She did not look the least bit surprised to see Millikin fall through.<br>
<br>
  &quot;For once your timing is impeccable, Ranger.&quot;  She continued lighting the candles, watching as the ranger reoriented herself.  Millikin straightened as she looked around.  Eclectic did not begin to describe the laboratory. (Or was it a library?) The room was illuminated enough to permit reading but it was not bright.  One wall possessed several shelves of books from ceiling to floor.  Several paintings that adorned the walls were rather macabre.  One was a graphic depiction of a historical battle, another showing victims of a blazing inferno.  Still another painting portrayed zombies engaging in a murderous rampage through a city that bore a striking resemblance to Freeport.  The ranger shuddered and took note of a few other details;  a table holding jars, vials, and various glass containers, several scaly and furry victims of taxonomy were inside display cases or stands in different corners of the room alongside statuettes of various compositions ranging from clay to diamond.  Located across from the wall of bookshelves was a desk with papers and books stacked on it.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Careful what you touch, Ranger.  Some things here are worth more to me than your life.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;I'll keep that in mind.&quot;  Millikin remarked.  &quot;I'd have never thought Quasqueton could miscast that badly.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;He didn't exactly.  I had to cast a spell that would bring you here the next time you attempted to use magic to travel.&quot;  Valdayana replied as she walked over to a rather grotesque bookstand that resembled a clawed hand tearing forth from the ground.  She opened the book and turned through a few pages.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Where is here?  And what is that ... animal called?&quot;  Millikin's attention had turned to the stuffed brown rabbit with a small rack of antlers affixed to its head.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;You are in my home.  And that is called a jackalope.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;I've never heard of such a creature.&quot;  Millikin studied it for several moments.  &quot;It's not a real animal.&quot;  The ranger announced after a minute.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot;  Valdayana shook her head.  &quot;It is something I created several years ago to catch the attention of the overly curious who are somewhat lacking in intellect.  Once again, it worked.&quot;<br>
<br>
Millikin glared daggers at the enchanter, who smiled slyly and added.  &quot;Though you are the first to realize it is fake.  Perhaps I should name it after you.  How does Milky strike you?&quot;  Finding the page she was searching for, she traced her forefinger along the page's script as she read.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;It does not strike me at all.&quot;  The ranger replied in a flat tone.  &quot;I know misery loves company but why else have you abducted me and brought me to your dismal abode?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Abducted?  That is a rather severe word.  Consider it a nontraditional invitation.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Abduction is an apt term.  You brought me here without my consent.  You do realize that abduction is a crime in any culture?&quot;  The statement was half-inquiry, half threat.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Not if there are no witnesses to the event or anyone alive to claim it happened.&quot;  Valdayana looked poignantly at Millikin to curtail the notion that her idea of a threat would intimidate her.  &quot;Bring me the silver jar on the table behind you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Millikin picked up the jar then paused as she contemplated telling her to get it herself before deciding that humoring the enchanter would be the fastest way to finding out what was up.  The medicine pouch she wore around her neck and intended to give the enchanter had been completely forgotten.  Valdayana took the jar and opened it, she recited a few phrases in an arcane language and passed the contents under Millikin's nose.  Millikin jumped backwards, startled both by the uncharacteristic act from the enchanter as well as the citrus aroma.<br>
<br>
  &quot;It's yuzu.  Used in some purification rituals and helps develop concentration and focus.  It should counteract the effects of your curse.&quot;  Valdayana explained, placing the jar back on the table.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You removed your curse?&quot;  Millikin eyed the enchanter warily.  Valdayana nodded and looked back into her book.  &quot;Why?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;I am researching a spell and you are going to help me with it.&quot;  She replied.<br>
<br>
  &quot;What spell?&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &quot;It's one I found in a journal during my studies.&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &quot;And this journal belongs to a friend of yours?&quot;  Millikin asked.  &quot;And I use the term friend loosely.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;It's not as if you know who Kintaz is, much less Alcina.&quot;  Valdayana answered loftily.  In truth, she wasn't exactly sure who Alcina was either.  The results of her research into the caster's identity was vague.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I know he's an enchanter and he developed the process used by the acolytes in the Temple of Solusek Ro to allow spellcasters to unlearn certain abilities.&quot;  Millikin retorted.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;Alcina is also an enchanter.  She developed her own series of spells that I found.  And if you quit interrupting me with your snide comments instead of relevant questions, I'll explain.&quot;  Valdayana was mildly impressed that a backwater ranger knew more about an enchanter than several fellow practitioners of the same form of magic could claim, though she wasn't about to say that.<br>
<br>
  &quot;What do you need me for?&quot;  Millikin asked after listening to Valdayana's prelect on the different effects of the spells she had uncovered.  Going on the presumption that Valdayana was telling her everything, (And Millikin doubted that was the case.) they all sounded like variants of several spells she'd already seen the enchanter employ so the significance of their discovery was lost on the ranger.  Besides, Valdayana did take advantage of the fact that she could cast a variety of spells (with annoying side effects) on the ranger without her consent, provided they were mostly non-harmful.  The ranger's curiosity at the discovery ended with Valdayana's explanation of their effects but suspicion of some other motive at work took form.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I wish to see if one of them can be used to induce a change in outlook and overall behavior.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;No.&quot;  The ranger stated emphatically, that sounded far too much like a charm spell for her tastes.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You have no choice.&quot;  Valdayana crossed her arms and smiled grimly at Millikin.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I'm not going to waste my breath arguing with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;You're being reasonable for once.  I anticipated that you'd be quite recalcitrant.  This will take less time than I expected.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;I'll show myself out.&quot;  Millikin turned and headed for the door.  Valdayana held up a hand and began another spell.  Millikin whirled around at the first syllables of the spell.  Time and again she heard that particular incantation, so she instantly recognized what the enchanter was now casting and knew what the effect would be, but inexperience in defending against the subtleties of enchantment led the ranger to react instinctively instead of rationally.  She drew her swords and charged towards the dark elf.<br>
<br>
Valdayana D`Varr held her ground, focused only on completion of her spell.  All she saw was the gathering of magical energy, the only sound she heard was her own sonorous chanting of arcane words to direct that energy.  It was a calculated risk because it was not impossible that the ranger could be within striking distance to disrupt her casting before she finished and she knew her protective magic would not last very long against a direct assault.  As the enchanter's attention returned to the physical world, she was greeted with the sound of steel clattering on stone.  Millikin stood unmoving.  Gone, however, was the ranger's taut stance, ever anticipatory of the necessity for a reaction.  The expression on her face was blank.  Valdayana knew the ranger's mind was in a haze and that she would not recall anything that happened while the spell was in effect. <br>
<br>
  &quot;I will make this as quick and painless as possible.&quot;  Valdayana slid the enchanted blades under the table with her foot as she took a vial from her pocket and dabbed her finger into the contents and traced a rune on Millikin's forehead, leaving behind a dark red smudge then recited a few arcane phrases.  There was a brief flicker of light as the rune she had traced vanished from natural sight.<br>
<br>

The spirit wolf paced back and forth.  The mental essence that separated wolf from elf been abruptly torn by a long forgotten magic ritual and it found it could not return to her.  The spirit wolf had watched their exchange and the dark elf's craven assault, powerless to intervene.  The enchanter had warded her from any sort of contact from supernatural creatures.  As the magic that had once called it to the ranger began to ebb, it realized that it had not been expunged entirely.  <br>
<br>
&quot;This act may come back to haunt you, Enchanter D`Varr.&quot;  The dark elf heard whispered as the wolf took corporeal form beside her.  Valdayana paused as she picked up another jar.  She did not hold any semblance of remorse for her actions but she was curious as to what creature Millikin had attracted as a protector.  The wolf was translucent and thin framed.  She knew its connection to the mortal plane was tenuous at best so the enchanter paid it little heed as she continued with her spellcasting ritual.<br>
<br>
  &quot;If you've any true regard for her welfare then you should know it is dangerous for her if you threaten me.&quot;  She held the jar over a candle flame, the contents ignited in a pale yellow flash and burned to make a bittersweet aroma.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Your exorcism was far from thorough.&quot;  The wolf growled softly.<br>
<br>
  &quot;It was sufficient to expel a mere totem spirit.&quot;  Valdayana traced a warding sigil in the direction of the wolf and with a single word banished him from the physical plane.<br>

  &quot;Coactu nutus...  Subsisto...&quot;  <br>
<br>
As the incantation came to a close, the ranger saw and felt a grey fog surround her.  Sight and sound blurred as a chill coursed through her body.  The ranger slouched forward as tension in her body departed, her grip on her swords loosened and they dropped unceremoniously to the ground.  The ranger could see, hear, and feel her surroundings but understanding had fled, higher consciousness had faded to meet the looming threat that faced her, the possible cessation of life as functions like metabolism, breathing, and blood circulation slowed to infinitesimal pace. <br>
<br>
  &quot;Exaudio.&quot;<br>
<br>
The enchanter's touch sent a surge of warmth through the catatonic ranger.  The magic's purpose was to insinuate itself into the wood elf's mental defenses, but the ranger's mind refused to acknowledge the strange force and continued its fugue cycle to ensure Millikin's basic life functions did not stop.  The spell's energy reverberated back to the enchanter.  <br>
<br>
Valdayana blinked, she was surprised to find any resistance considering the ranger foolishly fell to the initial and most obvious.  The dark elf closed her eyes in mental preparation for a contest of wills as she continued the spellcasting ritual, once more a current of eldritch force passed through the ranger, this time it merged with the ranger's mental processes, bolstering it as the magic trapping Millikin in a trance began to fade.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Nossas vontades transformam-se uma.&quot;<br>
<br>
The next thing Millikin recalled was the sickeningly sweet scent of crushed lavender and rose petals and seeing Valdayana with an opened vial in her hand, leaning wearily against a table.<br>
