If I'd had a private channel to do send it in, I would have used it.  Unfortunately, his EZBoard account doesn't allow private message.  So, my response to him was public.<br>
<br>
That you think the response was unwarranted is your opinion.  As I said before, the quoted sections of my post were his words.  He took a great deal of satisfaction from leading the guild that he did.  He implied that the mere fact that he was leader imparted to him greater wisdom. &quot;Are you the leader of a guild?  If not, then STFU&quot; to paraphrase, was his response to a number of issues I raised while in and out of the guild.  I told him a few times that if he kept it up, he'd not have that guild for long.   <br>
<br>
Yeah - it sucks for the ADD membership.  Having the guild fold out from under you is quite unsettling.  I'm sorry for those folks that were happy there.  I'm not sorry for Garaddor.  He was leading it when it went Controlled Flight Into Terrain.<br>

You are mistaken to even suggest this. All I am looking for right now is some peace and quiet, but nooooo its server assholes like you who just won't let things go. Get over it man, cause I got over you and your petty imperfections a long time ago.

Your pretty much talking out of your arse.  <br>
<br>
I have known Garaddor &amp; most of the officers in ADD since pre-Kunark.  We hunted together often and will continue to do so.  <br>
<br>
This elitist attitude that you indicate that Garaddor has is absolutely none existant.   I am talking from experience, taking into account the highest position I have held in a guild is officer in Moonlight Crusaders.  <br>
<br>
That was also an old guild, it disbanded - it happens.  <br>
 <br>
Guildleader jobs (and officers) is actually one of the most thankless jobs you have in EQ.  The bigger the guild the worse it is.  <br>
<br>
Having several guildies send the GL a tell at once I would assume is a nightmare, so he guards himself from his members with officers.  <br>
<br>
Nothing wrong in doing that otherwise he would have 100+ tells at once.  <br>

Suffice it to say that I take a small amount of pleasure in seeing what I predicted come about, and wished to tweak the nose of the one I said would be the cause of it. This being less than 24-hours after the event, the reaction is still a bit new.  <br>
<br>
And as for the painters... is that woman happy about the painters or not? (I suspect that's a regional colloquialism from across the pond.)<br>

<br>
The fact remains that while Garrador had a lot of friends and alliances online, he also made a lot of enemies.  He treated MANY people badly which some feel that they cannot forgive.  Some of you may not have had the pleasure of meeting this side of Garrador and the ADD that embraced those qualities, but I was one that did as were many others.<br>
<br>
There were some good people in ADD and I am sorry for the fact that they have lost their guild and hope they are able to form or find a new one soon.  <br>
