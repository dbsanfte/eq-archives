There are a number of High Quality people in ADD who have been members for long time.  Sadly, they seem to have grown into the minority.  <br>

Garaddor apparantly thinks the way to &quot;Ueberness (sorry no umlaut allowed here)&quot; is to bully into spawns and taking camps... All that makes you is a pariah.<br>
<br>
At least it appears that you are begining to show some leadership, although the type not many should follow.<br>

Im sorry to see noone even bothers to read my and tristadorns post which are the only ones of any relevance in the entire matter. Noone else had the info that we had and we were the ones issuing the orders so how can anyone elses post be of any relevance. Even Bippys ... i respect Bippy a lot and know her to be up and up person and i got nothing bad to say about her. Everyone seems to go like *absurd example out of court* (judge asks &gt; was the other guy first in the shop ... the Accused&gt; Yeh he was first in but only because he shot me in the leg from behind while i was in front of him otw to the shop ... the judge &gt; doesnt matter he was in the shop 1st you are found guilty as charged). I dont think i need to further explain anything other than what i did write in my post im sure ull agree its a very theral description lol even my own guildies told me its time consuming to read that book of a post.<br>
<br>
Id just like to adress that accusation about yael. It seems you are totally misinformed about that lol (as is most ppl that ever post here). That raid of yours was for a paladin whose name now escapes me to complete his Strength of Elements quest. The add raid was also for a paladin for the sme quest. You did not arrive first nor did we ... we both basically shown up in force at about the same time. At the early point neither of us was even aware that someone is shooting for yael so we both had 2 groups each in zone before we even started thinking hey those other guys might be here for yael too. I talked to that paladin who was leading your raid and proposed a rolloff as i always do. He said he has been waiting for yael to pop for months and wouldnt like to lose it on a roll. So we both agreed lets make it competitive and well just race to the mob. The agreement was reached in friendly and sportsmanlike spirits .. personally i thought we didnt have a chance of beating you to him since u were about to coth ppl almost directly to Yael ... if u had a mage camped in safe spot i dont know ... maybe just dragged him there and stick rezed im. Anyway he wished me good luck on breakin and i wished him good luck no the cothing. My force proceeded to fight our way down in what i can only describe as lightspeed since we arrived at yael before you guys were cothed. We hastily decide to pull and got wiped due to everyone being next to 0 mana from the breakin. Quite naturally in the spirit of the race you got in then and proceeded to kill the mob ... it was a fair and sqare race and you won it. I was the first to congratulate your raid and the paladin personally on the quest and kill and we chated for almost half an hour later discussing paladin class, inspected eachother equip and talked about how sad that yael is such a long pop. We did all this in good spirits .. my raid was aware of the race being a friendly competition and we all congratulated you on your kill. What caused you to beleive we were there trying to run over you is absolutely beyond me so please dont even start making accusations over thing u obviously have no idea of. Also please dont mock add ... our alleged huge force was an astounding AoW killing size of 13 people which was roughly the same as your force i would say. I never mocked anyone and much less gloated over someone elses failure and i do not deserve mockery and misstatements from anyone.<br>
<br>
Also even though i asked to be contacted in tells over the matter at hand Radiant did not do this. I made it a point of being online for 18 hours straight to give ample opportunity to do so. I am quite prepared to do something to redeem any wrongs and hurts real or imagined done to anyone by me but i suspect other party doesnt want any of that and will rather pout in the corner somwhere and for the next 6 months try to convince people that add is bad rather than accept what i would offer so we both could salvage some dignity rather than just close off to eachother and hail ourselves with gunshots. As it is in human society bad is always beleived before good so i fully suspect i managed to tarnish my name here no matter the GM ruling or my personal reputation in the past. So i guess i must live with it ... next time i should be less naive and not beleive anyone would even consider the flamed partys standpoint objectively.<br>
<br>
With that the matter is closed to me! Still awaiting in game contacts.<br>
