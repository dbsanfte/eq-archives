<br>
Thundor, as a question, how is this policy enforced?  I have been on many a weekend raid, yet have noticed several members not at the raid, during weekend times, yet logged on.  Unscheduled raids i can see.. but raids known in advance? I might be just confused, but if you could clarify please =P  yes, i'm aware of coming home from work too late to join..however being online before the raid starts, and during?  i'd as soon log so as not to be flamed for such behavior.  If you could shed some light onto this subject i'd be appreciative.<br>
<br>

I have sent tells to every single person who has shown up online and not attended the raid as to the reasoning. some are understandable, some are not. I think showing this post to everyone will clear the confusion that people might have had. so with that I give to you some ideas of good and bad excuses for missing a MANDITORY guild raid.<br>
<br>
Here are some bad excuses<br>
I can't be on long - This is the worst excuse i have seen people use. for shame, for shame. even if you can't be on long, the point is that even the littlest of little bit can help. if you know you can't be on long then tell the raid leader and have him put you in a group with the others who can't be on long so we won't have to keep regrouping people. but DO show up. like i said even minor help for a little bit (yes even conversation with other group mates while groups are formed)  can make all the difference in the world.<br>
<br>
I got here late - ok either one of 2 things happened. either 1. you couldn't get home any earlier to get online in which case you will do everything in your power to make the raid. or 2 you were purposely avoiding the start of the raid so you could go off and do your own thing because you didn't feel like coming. <br>
<br>
if scenario 1 is you then what you can do to prevent missing the raid is camp where we will meet the night before so we can do everything in our power to get you to us. If we can't then thats ok at least you tried and us officers see that (we're not NPC's ya know). stick around and meet in WC for when the raid finishes we can all get together, pass out loot and sing kumbaya.<br>
if scenario 2 is you then FOR SHAME! at least have the decency to play an alt or something so we don't know your online. to me this is just an ultimate slap in the face. I hope this isn't you.<br>
<br>
I'm camping Generic_camp_01 / camping Generic_camp_01 for my friend. I actually get this one alot. as nice as this may seem, i want you to remember something. before you put yourself in this situation remember. the guild raid is always posted in advance and the time will not change. so it is your own fault camping/telling your friend you would camp for  something when you promised YOUR guild that you have commited to that you will be at the raid that YOUR guild needs YOU for.<br>
<br>
I haven't seen Generic_player_01 in ages and i wanted to hunt with them. if they are truly your friend then they will be around for you either after the raid or before it that is the time to spend with them. heck if they are at oracles level bring them along as a guest. we would be happy to have them.<br>
<br>
here is the ONE good excuse that people can understand but make sure you inform the officers before the guild raid begins so we know.<br>
<br>
I am camping Difficult_epic_mob_01. I, of all people, know the heartache verant has given us into the need to quest for our epic weapons. although most of my mobs are not campable and need full guilds to raid, I know there are other epic pieces that are not. again you know the raid schedule before hand so either try to schedule your epic camp/battle well before or after the raid. if you can not (naggy/vox/etc...) PLEASE LET US KNOW in advance<br>
<br>
thats about my 2 cents worth. and obviously if your not online then you can't attend a raid so there is no good or bad excues about not being online. thats your business do with it what ya will. but for goodness sakes if your going to be on, do all you can to attend our raids. believe it or not they are quite fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
thats about my 2 cent's worth on the situation<br>

<br>
It is our responsibility as officers to convey the guild's charter and policies ect to the Oracle's of Truth &quot;family&quot;.  The Charter and other guild related  information is available on our website at www.oraclesoftruth.org.  Conversely, it is the responsibility of the OoT members to be aware of and support the charter, the policy and to do whatever is possible within their means to participate in the raids planned for the &quot;OoT Family&quot; when online during planned raid events.   <br>
<br>
I hope that with this and the response from Whallil, that we've answered your question.  Feel free to ask any officer at any time, any questions you have about this or any other matter related to Oracles.<br>
<br>
Warmest Regards,<br>
