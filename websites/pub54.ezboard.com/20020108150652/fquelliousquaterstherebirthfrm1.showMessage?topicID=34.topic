No, this isn't what the title suggests... I don't have a beef with another player.  It's just a short story of what happened last night in EW.  <br>
<br>
I am sitting on the hill overlooking the entrance to the Ry'Gorr fort in Eastern Wastes, auctioning to buy the ever-camped crystaline silks to further my now-sputtering tailoring business. (Someone smack Yakatizma with a trout - nice friggin planning.) I checked Crystal Caverns and there are about four level 59+ folks in the zone, all farming the silks.  I figure another farmer will just make the situation worse and take off, wishing them well and lots of luck in their endeavors.  I head back out to the Orc Fort entrance and see if folks in that zone have some silks they want to sell me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Healing/Buffing/Rezzing for Silks..  no joke&quot;  I /AUC to the zone every 10 min.  People are asking for rezzes left and right, offering cash.   I tell them that I'd rather have silk.   They don't have any but still need the rezzes.   Oh, well.   &quot;The best laid plans of mice and men...&quot;   I do a few rezzes and make a couple of bucks as donations.  (I have never charged a copper for the service, but will always accept donations both small and large.)<br>
<br>
I'm keeping an eye on the young folks grouping and pulling the orcs from within the fort, just to make sure they don't get in over their heads.  They have no idea I'm stunning/rooting/atoning them from a distance, keeping the aggro off of the delicate casters and druids running in desperate circles.  (So sue me.. I'm a nice guy. &lt;grin&gt;)<br>
<br>
Then, to break the monotony, I see someone (I think named Aurthur?) tell the zone that the invasion is going to begin in 10 min... please vacate at the Orc fort or risk death in the battle.  Cool!! I've heard about this quest but I've never seen it happen before. <br>
<br>
/sits and gets comfortable, waiting for the show.<br>
<br>
I ready an Invisi potion (never leave home without them) and freshen my SoW.  I also swap out my utility spell slot spell and put in Gate.  Being a cleric, I like to keep TWO methods of escape open to me: running and screaming like a little girl for the zone OR gating out when the going gets rough.  These two methods have proven to be effective when crossing long expanses of territory without escort.  Nothing looks as juicy to the mobs as a pale and skinny cleric running by himself thru unfriendly lands.<br>
<br>
Okay.. so with the exception of some heavily buttered popcorn and Pepsi's patented &quot;Tub-O-Cola&quot; movie theater-size soft drink (the kind you can actually soak your feet in during the flick) I'm all set!  Let the show begin.<br>
<br>
The invasion begins... Giants and Orcs pop up all over the front of the fort.  About 10 giants and maybe 20 of their smaller allies line up for battle two deep, facing the wilderness.  Behind me appears a small dwarven army, complete with guards, archers and clerics.  The dwarves attack, arrows fly and spells sizzle the Orcs left and right.  Giants swing mighty swords, cutting deep into the rank of dwarven meat shields.  I run up and take a few screen shots of the anarchy - needless to say, my framerate dropped faster than Roger Ebert skydiving.  I dodged and weaved in and out of traffic, carefully avoiding any AE spells which might make me appear.<br>
<br>
Long story short, the dwarves win the battle, putting down the final giant in a hail of arrows and cleric nukes.  Aurthur gets the ring and &quot;Grats&quot; ring out through the zone.  (That ring, btw, friggin rocks... check out the stats on your friendly neighborhood EQ infopage).  The remains of the dwarven army gather around the outside of the fort, awaiting instructions from the EQ code.  I head into the Orc fort to see what is left.<br>
<br>
Oh.  My.  God.  I wipe my eyes and check the monitor again.<br>
<br>
It's the Oracle of Ry'gorr!!  Spawned in the Throne room.  Still invisi, I head in there and check the upper mezzanine for Elites.  Nope.  None.  The Oracle is alone.  And if memory serves me right, this guy drops SOME friggin cool cloak.<br>
<br>
/is so excited that he gets douche chills.<br>
<br>
I check my buffs. All up. My resist gear is on and my combat spells (as well as Gate) are now memmed.  Mana is full.  Health points maxxed at 2422.  I walk up to the Oracle, flip him an invisible finger and then nuke his hairy little ass to open up the battle.   BAM!  That's 650 hit points he'll never see again.  He immediately comes running after me.<br>
<br>
Stun.  Root.  &quot;Oohh.. sucks to be YOU today, Mr Oracle.&quot;  My magic resist gear does it's job as I see the &quot;you have resisted xxx&quot; spells over and over again. Scourge.  Root.  Wrath.  Yadda, yadda, yadda.  This putz is trying to blast me into snail snot since he can't move.  I see him start to cast another spell. A fast stun interrupts him and leaves him open for another attack.<br>
<br>
I throw a nuke into his gut.  Blam!  He's down to three and a half bubbles of health.   Then I realize I made a mistake.  A classic mistake.  I didn't debuff him first.  Being a caster, he is able to stack up to three buffs on himself.  One of them I found out much to my chagrin, is Spirit of Wolf.  Damn.. I can't outrun this prick.<br>
<br>
I pull him outside the fort because there isn't enough room to play with him indoors and proceed to root park him off to the side.  We exchange artillery volleys, with him scoring twice to my four hits on him.  We both heal up a bit, with the edge going to me.  My nukes and heals are better than his, but... and this is a big but...  his mana pool apparently is bigger.  Okay, I gotta finish this up quickly.  I won't win a long-drawn out fight here.  I'm down to 40 mana and he's at two bubs of health.<br>
<br>
I can't unmem one of my combat spells in favor of Annul because every time I sit to mem it, he hits me with a spell that interrupts my book-time.  Friggin Orcs.  I hated them back in Crushbone when I was level 8 and I haven't lost that seething fury ever since.  This @#%$'s gonna take the dirt nap if it kills me. And I don't want to burn my only invulnerability (Divine Aura) on this cretin - I like leaving that for emergencies only.  And this isn't an emergency.  So I do what any red-blooded high elf would do when facing certain doom from a waaaay underconned blue critter.<br>
<br>
I pull out my Ykesha War club (warriors, please stop laughing in the back..  thank you) and throw myself into battle with the ugly bastard.  I lay a pair of Stuns into him, swing the mighty club as fast as I can - which seems like once a week.  He's down to one and a half bubbles and starts to heal up.  BLAM another stun silences that effort.  He's pissed and hits me for 173.  Holy @#%$ Ouch, Batman.  THAT hurt.  Okay, I need to put the kibosh on this thing before he smears me.<br>
<br>
I step back, pull out my &quot;certified, never fails to send the casters packing&quot; Invoke Fear and quickly send his frightened rump running.  He can't cast heals while feared and since I'm SoWed, I can stay behind him the whole way, tenderizing him with my club.<br>
<br>
I stun him and throw one last nuke into him.  He's down to NO red pixels in his health bar. And I'm down to my last pixel on my blue mana bar.   One or two more hits with the club should put him down.  Root breaks and I figure &quot;this is easy.. it won't take me but 20 seconds to kill him&quot;.<br>
<br>
And then I realized that it won't take the Oracle but 19 seconds to reach the NPC dwarves outside of the fort.   RAT BASTARD!!   I go to throw a last root on him.  No mana.  Stun?  No mana.  I flip him the bird again, hoping to get his attention, no luck.<br>
<br>
As much as I wanted to kill this prick myself, fate has picked me up by my short hairs and flung me into a massive steaming pile of orc dung.  Some little dwarven archer sees fit to Kill Steal my friggin' Oracle.  He shouts in white text &quot;You stinking Orc! I'll kill you!!&quot; or whatever his generic battle line is and kills my Oracle.  My blood-soaked, dying and beaten - and most importantly cloak-laden - Oracle disappears from the screen.  And for just an instant,  I saw a little smile on the Orc's face as that arrow hit him, mocking me unto the bitter end.  Maybe it was just the sunlight hitting the snow, blinding me for a moment... but I could have sworn I saw him smile.<br>
<br>
/is just another victim of the system.<br>
<br>
I sigh and sit down.  Breathing heavy and weary from the fight, I reach for another handful of popcorn and munch away while cursing myself for being such a putz.   One and a half bubbles of health left and no mana.  And nothing to show for my troubles.  But I blame myself for not ANNULing that bastard's ass in the beginning.   That would have been the difference - because without Spirit of Wolf, he wouldn't have made it out to the Dwarves in the short time he did near the end of that battle.<br>
<br>
So what have we learned tonight, ladies and gentlemen?  <br>
<br>
1.  Always, always, always pull a caster MOB with Annul.<br>
2. Don't think that because you are a high level, that you aren't occasionally stupid.<br>
<br>
Learn from my mistakes and have a great day, y'all!!<br>

Inside the fort, we were dealing with a repop of the 3 normal mystics, 2 Kromdiff Commanders, and the nasty 3-some of nameds that pop as part of the quest:  The Orc Chief, Oracle of Ry'gorr, and Firebrand the Black (weilding TWO Dark Embers no less).  Boy, that was fun!<br>

Really enjoyed your story and can feel your pain.  I've done some fairly stupid things in my time as well and have had plenty a mob KS'd by guard or other NPC.  <br>
<br>
What stupid mistakes have I made?  Well...Snared myself, Snared a party member, SoWed a mob, Healed a Mob, fell asleep at the controls and fell off a mountain.  Guess I better stop there, no-one may ever want me in their group hehe.<br>
