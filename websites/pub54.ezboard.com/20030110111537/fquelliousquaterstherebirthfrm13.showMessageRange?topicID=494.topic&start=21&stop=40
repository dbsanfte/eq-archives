As for the ninjalooted map piece,  I dont know anything about that.  they said it was still on corpse but I told them to leave it unless the corpse was about to rot.  All this came down to is a rare spawn that everyone wants, whats done is done. MK got the kill and whatever loot he dropped.  But my opinion is that if there is someone already kiting it around, let them try to take him first.  Its because of situations like this ppl get pissed over nothing... all I have to say is ITS ONLY A GAME!!!! get over it<br>

Four: When we engaged the turtle your force was nowhere near ready to engage, you got wiped. So why should we give you a second chance to wipe only to have the turtle despawn?<br>

Fact is you didn't get the job done. MK did. Your guild members then saw fit to Not only be completely assanine in OOC and shout, BUT decided to openly Ninja loot the map piece from the turtle.<br>

<br>
Me and palazious proved that not to be true when we tried to train off a guardian wurm at a ragefire camp.<br>
<br>
dont know how it happened but i was goofing around the statue area.  The exp group of two guilds. errantly agrod a Guardian wurm. i was invis it ran right through me.  i kept running cause /shrug you dont pull a guardian less your ready for a guardian.  Then i hear ... says in guild &quot;help&quot;. <br>
<br>
I make my way back to the rage camp to see palazious had gated in.  he was trying to kite a Guardian wurm away but kept getting summoned.  Im thinking well why the fook did he damage it.  I check its damage its still like at 95%.  I announce i aint damaging it.  ill kite it off when palazious dies.  <br>
<br>
Pala dies. i break invis at the guardians feet without hitting it.  Guardian tears into me. i run away.  Guardian summons me.  i think wtf.  Palazious says in guild chat that he hadnt damaged it.  I notice a pattern =).  I run it off but eventually die to summons.<br>
<br>
Moral:<br>
A mob you havent damaged can summon you nowadays.  Think once someone engages it. it can summon.<br>
<br>
dont know but i do know atleast two people were summoned for just being around an engaged mob that nite.<br>

1. I wasn't there.<br>
2. Ninjalooting is bad, regardless of circumstances. Worse, even, than killsteal.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to offer an opinion on the whole event, but Qutsemnie is right about summons in general, though perhaps not in this specific circumstance. <br>
Undamaged mobs will not summon, regardless of debuffs. Once the mob is damaged, though, it summon whomever is highest on the aggro list at the moment. Enchanters don't generally do damage, particularly early in a fight. Sure, if it's a big mob, we may nuke later on if we're bored <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Still, if you tash too early, or tash and sit, you get to hear &quot;You will not evade me!&quot; without doing any damage to the mob.<br>
Again, I don't know the particulars of this situation, but it is definitely possible to get summoned without you personally damaging the mob.<br>

<br>
However I have Kited Lodizal on many occaisions, and handed him off to the MA and have not been summoned for my trouble even once when the MA engages.<br>
<br>
I don't know what the kiter in this case was doing to that poor turtle to get so much hate built up that Lodi prefered to summon and eat the kiter over the 60 War and others beating on him.<br>
<br>
Then again if we hadn't engaged Lodi and your raid had you would have died anyway since you had so much hate that he summoned you when MA engaged.  <p>Raenoir DuShaine<br>

They got us after we had engaged and were fighting him.  They dropped in with a wizard, monk and rogue and hit disc.  Looted everything and evac'd out..only to see them auctioning loot 10 min later.<br>
<br>
All we can do is sit and wait for theirs to come around.  It will catch up to them. <p><center><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=76387">Kumaddara Icecaster</A></b></center><center><A HREF="http://www.lotuscult.com">Lotus Cult</A></center>

I'm hoping on getting my hands on a lodi shield sometime this century, but it seems like it's camped the second it spawns.<br>
<br>
Take care everyone and safe journies to you all<br>

2 years after Velious came out I still dont understand the big deal about that stupid shield and the fight that ensued over it.<br>
<br>
Heirophant's Cloak for back and Orb of the Infinite Void for secondary are far superior and more easily and more commonly available. Why expend all that energy (and indeed your guild's energy) to get a Shield with 0 hp/mana ? EB Item ?<br>
<br>
Not trying to berate anyone....... just want to add to my own knowledge since I've always have had many opportunities to loot or roll for the shield piece after I had helped kill it and I've never done so since I believed the shield was inferior.<br>

Hey Desi the secret is the map piece, shield suxxors.<br>
<br>
Frankly, from an endgame perspective the shield is weak. In general, a shield/back slot with wis, resists and EB is very useful to have around <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=185923">Ragnarz</a> - Warlord<BR>
