&lt;&lt;&quot;He did it for fear of repurcussion, not out of generosity. If it was a lower level guild with whom he didn't care about his 'faction' they'd have eatin it. I hate that type of person. Pick on the weak &amp; kiss the ass of the strong&quot;&gt;&gt;<br>
You know that for a fact?  Why would Montyy care what VM thinks, he is a member of RiP, not VM.  <br>
<br>
And Ragnarz, that last bit about Wraith and Reviv was just me poking fun, I realize that they are 2 different guilds.  You just always see them raiding together, relax a bit ;o) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370173"">Why I die so much</a><p>

VM has the levels and clout to extract revenge, whatever form that might take.  That is why he didn't do it.  It wasn't out of generosity, it was out of fear.  Unfortunately fear is the only motivating factor for 95% of people these days; others' rights &amp; feelings aren't even a concept in the pebbles that most people call brains. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucorentheius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Corentheius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Kor Shaman</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/2/02 1:32:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=555.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> to thoes bitching about Invis potions</span><hr size=1> look at this nice little toy<br>

You seem unable to accept that he didnt train them because he was being courteous.  You think he didnt train them out of fear, but you have no base from which to accuse Montyy of cowardice and no way to prove your theory.

As for the 'fear of retribution' theory, you are really not too bright are you gaichin. Do you honestly think that VM would waste their time, as you say, wrecking retribution for a train? Even if it did cause a raid to wipe I'm sure they'd be pist but what could they possibly do to him other than not like him and call him a meany head for dropping a dragon on them? He doesn't type /consent playernamehere and they can't move him. They can't invis his corpse(damn that would be a fun trick) and as long as he doesn't click ok on the Revive then he's ok. <p>Death before dishonor<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=161711">Slasra Cha'kalla</a> - 58th Luminary of Reviviscence<br><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=255278 ">Sskarth Ecrusher</a> - 31st Legionnaire of Reviviscence<br><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163893">Megonna</a> - 50th Test of the Swifttail</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uthaylin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thaylin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Bok Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/5/02 1:25:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=555.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Repeat after me: There is no subliminal message in the p</span><hr size=1> Also you accused oddies of being someone that would train you on purpose just to get back to you.

I can't believe I just read 6 pages about nothing 'cept trains and typing lessons.  What a waste. Of course, I do play this stupid game so &quot;waste&quot; is relative. Personally, when someone is so kind as to pull mobs for me but they bring more mobs than I can handle and I expire, they usually rez me either on their own or after I've asked them kindly if they would do so. I prefer &quot;ubers&quot; as they usually have 5-6 click stickers along with them.<br>
I'm  not going to reveal my toon-so don't ask me, I don't want people to stop pulling for me.<br>
(What the hell is a TRAIN anyway.)<br>
<br>
Can I hijack this thread to talk about a really important subject?  For instance: Hillary Clinton's selection of toenail polish. Seeing as her toe is technically split into more than one section, shouldn't each section be a different color?<br>

UBER GUILD -- FREE FACTION HITS WITH Quellious_PCs<br>
<br>
Call trains. Encourage members to call trains. Come up with cute little sayings if you need to be creative. Keep doing it.<br>
<br>
EVERYONE ELSE<br>
<br>
Quit bitching and moaning about train announcements when you see'em in ooc/shout. If you want to say something, then /shout Good luck.<br>
<br>
Why do all these people seem to pick on UBER_GUILD_01?<br>
<br>
Because after seeing unannounced trains from people with the same guild tag, over and over and over, you start to think that *gasp* there might actually be a connection between events and this guild.<br>
<br>
I BELONG TO AN UBER_GUILD and WHY SHOULD I CARE? (and really anyone can opt in on this one -- no level or equipment requirements)<br>
<br>
Because what some of us non-uber guild people are complaining about is simply feedback. I have had good experiences with most of the guilds mentioned in this thread. However, even those with the best rep, (Lotus Cult in my personal opinion), have this (for lack of a better term) public relations problem. This is my biggest personal complaint about the big guilds. If you can help your guild's reputation out by simply hitting a hotkey that seems like an exceedingly small price to pay for making your guild look better in the eyes of us unwashed masses.<br>
<br>
And for every whiner who bitches about a train message in /shout or /ooc there's a bunch of smart players who're busy moving out of the way and much happier knowing about a train than being surprised.<br>

<br>
As for this &quot;you should have contacted a officer&quot;  *yawn*   it was a griefing trainer.  if i /oocd /tell random_officer for every griefer in the game i would be a very busy person.  thats work and its not my job to work to make lc a better guild.  I mean you already started off by protecting your own.  naturally the first response to any such claim is &quot;oh two sides to every story.&quot; the old wink in the nod here comes the mud if you want to prosue your claim.  and at this point i dont care what sort of people you keep in LC so why would i work so hard?<br>
<br>
These post really havent been bout the trainer.  it was me raising an eyebrow that anyone thought they could assemble 100+ people into one guild and have them all be the utmost honorable people such that not a one of them would train someone in grief. I thought that was interesting.  <br>
<br>
You made a &quot;for all LC&quot; statement and i gave you the exception that disproves the &quot;for all.&quot;  you might not believe it.  But the point is that when your dealing with an outside world that doesnt believe the &quot;for all LC&quot;  now you know why.<br>
<br>
Im not saying that is the goal. the honorable nature of 100+ people being a goal for a guild of that size isnt what im saying.  In fact ive never thought of it as one.  An overall good naturedness perhaps.  But not an absolute.  its impossible.   <br>
<br>
And LC does have a good nature. For the most part as fine as an assembledge of so many people as you are going to see in this game.  Thats saying alot.  But its not a &quot;for all LC&quot;<br>
<br>

My question is if you know the area you are camping is frequently trained because of the location why dont you just move to a train free spot?<br>
<br>
Are there so FEW areas in EQ to actually find spots where traisn cant happen or do you just prefer the safety of a zoneline SOOooo much that you put yourself and train central?<br>
<br>
When I used to exp in KC way back when I would move my group to train free spots . <br>
<br>
Basically ... avoid friggin zone lines and youve solved your own problem of trains.<br>
<br>
There are way too many classes that dont have invis and not from choice . You have the choice of where you set up camp so think twice about where youve chosen to exp.<br>

But we wont <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> know</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> unless you say something to an officer when something like that happens.  But, if youre too lazy to send a simple tell then you have no point complaining since you cant be bothered to help try and make things better.<br>
<br>
Yes things get done.  Yes there are always two sides to a situation, sometimes more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  But if someone is being a jerk like that they def will be talked to and we have deguilded people in the past.  They dont belong in LC.<br>
<br>
Also I went back looking and i never said anything like &quot;for all LC&quot; that you quote me saying.  Quotes mean youre using what soemone else said word for word, please learn to use them correctly so you dont give other people false ideas with what you say.  Closest thing I said is that LC doesnt condone such actions and thats truth.  But as I pointed out above if youre too lazy to send a tell (omg its hard work) then the officers cant take disciplinary action. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=555.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=555.topic&start=41&stop=44>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=555.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=555.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=555.topic&index=20><img src=http://xtctripp101.homestead.com/files/qc/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=555.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=555.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=555.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=555.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
