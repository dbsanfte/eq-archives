Raid Friday and Saturday, *snipe*.  <br>
<br>
Sunday was funny...  Two of the guildies and I went to Howling Stones with some Stormriders... one of which is the infamous Raslla.  She's a load of fun actually. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Vanguard pulled a train worthy of Arclight.  2 golems + 4 skeletons.  No one dead though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Poor Vanguard, he didn't try hard enough. <br>
<br>
We settled down in the South Wing.  After that some Emerald Templars came into zone. They are a great group of people. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Courteous, fun and they definitely know what they are doing!<br>
<br>
Sever bought in a group at this point.  Poor guy, I totally yelled at him.  This is what happened.  He did a camp check to which my group replied, &quot;South Wing&quot;.  Polynices from ET told them they were on route to East via South. I guess Sever was confused by the # of groups in zone.  Sever started to question Poly where the ET groups are, etc.   Sever thought no one was not at South yet, Sever said in ooc that it's not ET's camp because they were not there yet.  By this time I was irritated and I yelled at Sever in ooc, &quot;WE ARE IN SOUTH, THERE ARE THREE GROUPS IN HERE RIGHT NOW, HAVE I MADE IT CLEAR EVEN TO A SK THAT SOUTH IS CAMPED?&quot;  Silence from everyone at that point... oops me. Later someone told me that usually there's only 1 group in HS, so20 people in zone was kinda of a record.  <br>
<br>
Sorilea and Baramore were really polite and nice about asking to pass through our camp. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I was being a big pain and told them, &quot;Sure, but you gotta pay a TOLL!&quot;  Couples minutes later Polynices run through yelling, &quot;Clarity TRAIN!&quot;  Consider that my group consisted of Shaman(53), Shaman(59), Druid(55), Rogue(55), Warrior(56) and me(Pally 57), Wizard(58 who came later) and Necro(60) who was there just to help us level and pull, we really do need the c2 shots.  <br>
<br>
When Sever's group went through, we also yelled, &quot;TOLL PLEASE&quot;.  Nuggin actually tried to give us 108pp.  That really send us all laughing.  <br>
<br>
Raslla and Vanguard had to log for a bit, so Ward and I went over to hang out with the Emerald Templars while rest of our party take a break.  Baramore's group picked me up.  OMG, he's SO amazing.  Non-stop pulling in a group of Cleric(53), Monk(56), Bard(59 puller), Paladin(57), Rogue(55) and Shaman(59).  I had a TON of fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Even the DA run out was funny.  <br>
<br>
I had a ton of fun in HS.  My first time in that zone.  It is now one of my favorite dungeon next to Dragon Necropolis, Velk's Lab and Siren Gretto.  I still dislike Karnor's and Sebilis though.<br>
<br>
I don't see HS, Kael, Velk's Lab, Siren Gretto and Dragon Necropolis become the new Sebilis. Those zones are &quot;bring your own group&quot; type of zone.  And they are SSOOO far out of the way.  It's pretty hard for most zones to beat the amount of experience and loot Sebilis holds.  Pickup groups can be questionable in Sebilis, I have heard some good and bad stories about pickup group there. I am not a big fan of going to zones where I can't walk out on my own.  I went to Sebilis twice with friends and once with my guild, so far I have yet to die there.(cross her fingers)  I would like to do Jugs/shrooms one day... I wonder how well I can tank in there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   *quad quad splat*<br>
<br>
I am not surprised that alot of people still prefer Kurnak over Velious.  The Velious mobs hit so damn hard. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This is not bragging, just a matter of fact statement...  After getting quad for 200~300+, getting tripled for 100 or so really isn't a big deal anymore...  <br>
<br>
I went to a guild raid in Kael later... but since I was literally falling asleep at the computer, they made me go to bed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Ummm.. I didn't play, so my weekend went rather well LOL.  I don't play EQ about every other weekend.. preventative EQ burnout maintenance kinda..  Actually, lately, it hasn't been bad at all.  Been having a good time.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I tagged along on a jugg raid in Sebilis (first time I went back there since hitting 60 there several days before).  Even though I absolutely love Sebilis, I've basically played it to death and I know it's time to get out and do -anything- else.  I've been to Dragon Necropolis now 3 times, and I'm really enjoying it, and soon I'd love to try out Siren's (so far I've just passed through on the way to DN).  Velk's I've been in twice but I've certainly not yet seen most of the zone.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty much living in Velious now...Kunark is great for exp grinding, but now I'd love to just explore and have fun.  Look me up Llorac if ya need an paramedic for your groups.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Don't really want to make them come back to get me from WW.  So I actually made 1.5 blue on my druid &quot;helping&quot;(more like getting in the way) Tenasi with her Shawl 6 quest.  So pretty much spend from 6pm to 10pm kicking back/questing/xfering cured silk armor to my lvl 1 monkey(thanks Dewi who is practicing for shawl quest).  Then I joined a Velk group for about 30 minutes(only 5 minutes of it fighting while rest of it spend waiting for things to start), then I left because I promised to spend some time with a friend. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
I am still grinding away in Kunark.  The experience is better there only because it's easier to get a group and with the right people in the right place you can pull various mobs almost non-stop.  Whenever possible though, I drag a few guildies over to Velious to hunt giants or storm the tower.<br>
<br>
Except for helping kill Tarbul and DE corrupter/reavers way too many times for mage/druid/ranger epics and going on disasterous PoD raid (PoD 2, me 0), my weekend belonged to the twinkies. <p>Juror Seraphim<BR>
