Reagan won the Cold War by his willingness to throw large sums of money at Star Wars, and the Russians couldn't keep up and went broke.  Ask Margret Thatcher.<br>

<br>
A War will not necessarily gaurentee an economic rebound. In fact, Bush Sr.'s attempt at a legacy, Desert Storm, did not help him to a re-election. The economy faultered and stagnated, shortly after the success in the middle east. The trickle down economy effects did not occur, and they won't occur this time either. In fact, Bush Sr. went from an approval rating in the 90% range to not even getting elected. Bush #2 does not have the guidence of an unbiased group of people when it comes to dealing with the middle east, Colin Powel, who hit the lime light during the middle east conflict,  and many others are all his aids now, this is not good. Short of Margret Thatcher showing up and taking Bush #2 on a 3 day trip to a bunker in Colorado, we are seeing nearly the same thing we saw from Bush #1. Bush #2 is a sad excuss for a president. Perhaps Bush should try getting Bin Laden first then move on to bigger fish. There is no reason to mobilize an army against Sadam Hussien, he is clearly using this and Sept. 11th as a soap box to help boost the republicans in the next election and to help with his re-election bid, it won't work.  Congress needs to stop letting Bush #2 spend $500 million every few months to put him in the lime light. His spending is out of control, and the projects they are spent on are absolutly a waste. The people in Florida will count the votes right this time.<br>
<br>
As for the person, and any other person who makes a comment saying that we in the U.S. have suffered greatly at the hands of terrorists from the attacks of Sept. 11th, you are dead wrong. The people that reside in the middle east suffer through acts of terrorism and re-talitory actions EVERY DAY. More people have been injured and killed in that area than you can possible fathom. Yes the attacks on the towers were grusome and terrible, but imagine if it was that way every day for you. Our pain and suffering is miniscule compared to those elsewhere.<br>

You can thank Reagan for the dick in the ass you get from the banking industry. Reagan was nothing but a puppet for Nancy and still is. <br>
<br>
If you strongly believe that &quot;trickle down economics&quot; exists, you need to get out of the 80's. There is no proof that the idea lambasted by the (R) in the 80's has emerged. <br>
<br>
The economic recession is not really a recession, we are still growing just at a slower rate. Alan Greenspan was right back in the late 90's we were experiencing growth at a rate which the economy could not sustain. Anything over 2.5% growth is looked at as a warning sign of inflation. This is proven by the recent string of firms doctoring their books to make it look like their growth is still on par. No one except DOTcom companies and tech stocks has anything serious to worry about. The business cycle is exactly that, a cycle. We will be heading back to the peak again soon, and guess what? We will go back down after that, but I gaurentee that the economy will never &quot;devalue&quot; it will just grow at a slower rate. How can you blame Clinton for anything, I thought he was the do nothing President?<br>

BTW Mohogani, he didn't win the electoral college per se, he was appointed president by the supreme court who awarded him the state of Florida, thereby giving him a victory in the electoral college, but thats soooo two years ago.  Oh, and Reagen won the cold war by ballooning military spending by siphoning all money away from important domestic programs resulting in a massive debt.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if half of the bush administration would put down their bibles and pick up a history book they might actually learn something useful.  War NEVER stops killing, it only redirects who's being killed.  <br>
<br>
The Iraqies dont attack the US cause they are just genetically preprogramed to hate all americans, as some news agencies might seem have you think.  They are pissed off because the U.S. has been extremely exploitive and manipulative in their dealings with Mideast countries.  We demand that they let us get their oil, but at the same time have the nerve to demand that they comply to our ways.  If your friend loses his job and you let him come live YOUR house, then he starts complaining about how your bed isn't made, orders you to prepare him a special vegetarian meal for dinner, then whines cause you didn't put enough lettuce on the salad, and then refuses to leave when you ask, you're not gonna be to happy either.  Jebus, he's in YOUR house ordering YOU around!  Thats the situation in the middle east and Sadaam is the only one that said &quot;No, I'm not going to tolerate this, get out&quot;.  We're so friggin addicted to their oil nipple we just cant let go yet we continue to try and order these countries around like THEY are the ones in OUR territory.  Thats no kind of negotiating position!  As long as we're stuck on the oil, there's no way there will ever be peace between the middle east and the U.S..  Taking out Sadaam aint gonna fix a damn thing.  Until we ween ourselves off that dope, we're going to be dependant on mideast oil, and thus, unable to negotiate in a reasonable manner.  <br>
<br>
We claim that Sadaam is some kind of living satan, and that no other people in the world suffer as much as those in Iraq.  The government tries to pass this off as a humanitarian mission and that we are freeing the oppressed people of Iraq and that once Sadaam is dead, the Iraqi women will be free to rip off their veils, and dance gidily around in the streets, a la Juilie Andrews in the sound of music, while the men and the children clap their hands to the beat of the uptemo sitar music and the world will be free of oppression and tyrany forever!  Sorry, not gonna happen.  The fact of the matter is this, there are places in the world where conditions are immesureably more deplorable than in Iraq.  For instance, lets take Uganda.  There you have a military general declaring genocide upon another tribe.  Millions slaughtered, but nobody in the U.S. gives a shit.  Why?  Because they dont have any oil do they.  They have nothing we need.  The Iraq mission isn't about being humanitarian, its about oil.<br>
<br>
Oh but we're in luck, thanks to the supreme court we've got an oil man in the white house, actually, LOTS of oil men!  Surely they'll want to help us become less dependant on foreign oil.  I really love their plan to spend 10 years and 40 bagillion million dollars building an oil pipeline up in the Alaskan wilderness to get a 6 month supply of oil so that we'll be free of foreign oil between January and July of 2012!  Thats just the kind of inginuity and forward thinking thing we need.<br>
<br>
No I'm not a Sadaam lover so dont start flaming me like I'm some kind of traitor.  Clearly the way he choses to go about fighting back at the U.S. is nowhere near the top of the &quot;good things to do&quot; list.  I am simply pointing out the often overlooked issues that are present in this situation.  Remember, when you're pointing the finger at someone, you've got 3 pointing back at you.  We as a country seem to forget that a lot.<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Anyway, the first thing that needs to be done is a huge increase towards the development of alternative fuel sources.  We can't negotiate effectively as long as we're dependant on oil from the region.  Then...maybe if we redirected some of this inflated military spending towards domestic and international aid programs, diplomatic relations initiatives, and public schools, we might one day raise a generation capable of dealing with conflict through less barbaric means.  One can only hope.<br>

&quot;I do not think history will be kind to Reagan. We had really little to do with winning the cold war as much the internal contradictions of the Soviet System had in losing it.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Shrug* It's all a matter of opinion. We've had 20 years since Reagan first started swinging and polls still show him as being considered one of the greatest presidents of all time. Then again, Reagan was a rebound president much like Bush II. The country was rebounding from the absolute dearth of leadership in the Carter admin.<br>
<br>
Internal contradictions may have been a problem, but without pressure from the outside, flawed systems can continue to exist for quite some time. The Reagan admin destroyed the Soviet Machine by out-producing it. The out-production bankrupted the Sovs and allowed internal dissent to flower. Without the resources drawn away from internal policing, the Sovs would likely still have the same system as previously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Reagan's biggest accomplishment was in changing a merely huge deficit to an unbelievably enormous one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Feh. At the time, it was what was needed. Do you think we would have had the prosperity of the late 80's through 2000 were it not for what Reagan started? <br>
<br>
As to people still bitching about this non-existant war, does anyone have any backing to show that it is anything more than talk, or is everyone bleating like worried sheep and believing the empty sabre-rattling? <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

I like to blame Clinton, because turn about is fair play.  Liberals blame Republicans for all the evils in the world with no substantiating evidence.  So, I choose to blame Clinton (well Hilary since Bill is just a puppet of Hilary's), because I can.<br>

We have the liberals ranting again that Bush did not win the election. We have the peaceniks decrying Bush for a war that doesn't exist. We have oddballs analyzing why the American psychology somehow makes it a global aggressor. Then we have one of the all-time stupidities, &quot;Violence breeds violence&quot;.<br>
<br>
It's getting deep in here.<br>
<br>
A) Can we maybe agree that whether or not you believe that Bush won legitimately or not, that it has NOTHING to do with ANY discussion here? It's a null issue, people. Bitch all you want about the Supreme Court, but the decision is made.<br>
<br>
B) The war does not exist. It has not happened. It is not even particularly getting prepared for. I live in what is very likely the largest concentration of American Military forces on the East Coast (Hampton Roads area in Virginia), and it is dead obvious around here when a build-up is occurring. You get a massive influx of troops and gear, neither of which we are seeing. I simply do not believe this proposed war on Iraq is anything real at this point. It is a threat, nothing more.<br>
<br>
C) Our psychology is violent? Scuse me? Since when does this matter, and what culture isn't psychologically violent? I happen to have history books, modern ones, what show your peaceful Europeans as being FAR more aggressive than we in the last century alone. As a superpower, we've been positively angelic. So we like guns, muscles, and such. Whee! We're so frikken evil. For every example of American aggression globally, I can point out nigh-unbelievable numbers of aggressions by other so-called peaceful nations throughout the history of the world. Everyone is aggressive when their interests are threatened. Noone is clean of that &quot;stain&quot;. <br>
<br>
D) Violence breeds violence. Yup, and Peaceniks breed victims. And? <br>

Woot, the Electoral college, where a person from California is worth less than 1/4 of a person from Wyoming! BTW Mohogani, he didn't win the electoral college per se, he was appointed president by the supreme court who awarded him the state of Florida, thereby giving him a victory in the electoral college, but thats soooo two years ago. Oh, and Reagen won the cold war by ballooning military spending by siphoning all money away from important domestic programs resulting in a massive debt.<br>

<br>
The Electoral College has been around for a looong time, Bush used it to his advantage and Gore ignored it.  Why did the supreme court have to make a decision in the first place?  Bush won Florida, so by all rights he gets all of Florida's votes.  When one of them refused to cast her vote, then it had to be litigated.  It only came to that because of sore losers.  I only brought it up because Bubba mentioned it first.<br>
<br>
So, at least you admit Reagan won the Cold War.  Thanks to him we don't have to fear Mutually Assured Destruction and all that BS.  He destroyed the &quot;Evil Empire&quot;, thank-you Mr President.  Now, we can look at becoming allies with Russia, a much better solution than a real war.  I would do the same thing by spending money to save lives.<br>

<br>
The point your missing is the hipocrasy that Bush exudes. <br>
<br>
Fact: Bush is on a mission against terrorism, and those that harbor terrorists.<br>
<br>
Fact: The U.S. has hit civilian installations in its many attempts to &quot;right the wrongs&quot; made against others and our selves. Examples include but are not limited to; countless villages in Vietnam, the Chinese Embassy, &quot;an old folks home&quot; in Afganistan, countless civilian buildings in Iraq and Afganistan, and who knows what else!<br>
<br>
Fact: Most of these transgressions occured in conflicts not wars.<br>
<br>
Fact: The laws that others violate, but the U.S. is immune to are written by the U.S. under the pen name of the U.N. and other &quot;multilateral international organizations&quot;.<br>
<br>
My point is that Bush is trying to elminate terrorism with even more terrorism. The only difference is that he is terrorising non-americans. That is hipocracy(sp?) at its finest friend. He is, at best, a blubbering fool when it comes to foreign relations, demonstrated by the fallout of relations and fallout of peace in the mideast since his arival at the white house. <br>
<br>
Saying that violence breeds violence is a studitiy in this case, is just wrong, not to mention you don't really give a reason to not act like a hot head. Thats why the nations leaders are there to stop the &quot;fanatcism&quot; that comes with peoples interests being at risk. That is why they are called negotiations, and peace talks. I agree terrorists shouldn't be negotiated with, but Bush doesn't negotiate with anything/anyone that is what makes him a poor president. <br>
<br>
And its Tom Daschel, the next president of the U.S. unless a Kennedy is reincarnated.<br>

<br>
Everyone has their transgressions, but someone has to not part take in them for the evil to stop...<br>
<br>
Military is probably our only viable answer for the al queda but not Bush style hard nosed bull. It will only create more response along the same lines as Sept. 11th, and it already has.<br>
