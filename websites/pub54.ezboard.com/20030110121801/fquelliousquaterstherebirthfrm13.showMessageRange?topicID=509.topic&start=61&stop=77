Getting 60 was a personal goal of mine. Yeah I rushed to it...yeah I pissed alot of people off in the process because I couldn't STFU about it. But when I heard that ding, I cried. Why? Because it was over. The rush to grind, the &quot;gotta get more exp&quot; feeling. Yeah I'm working on AA...but after being 60 for almost 5 months, I still only have 27 AA. <br>
<br>
I reached a point at the beginning of July where I was bored. Where logging on Alleusion just so I could sit in the nexus giving out c3 while I waited to AE, or going to Sebilis so I could do the same thing over and over again did not appeal to me any more. Then events occured that allowed me to experience what I had once dreamed about when I first started playing this game....I got to raid...every damn day. Now I get to log on, read the /guildmotd and go. <br>
<br>
It's not about the loot. I'm not uber, and probably never will be. It's about the accomplishment of doing something I have never done before. The first time I saw Tunare, walking into Seru's arx, seeing the AoW, seeing that HUGE robed thing in Ahkeva...I swear my jaw sat on the floor during my entire recruitment with Explicit. It still does.<br>
<br>
And like you I have a variety of toons...my second highest being a lvl 41 cleric. Across the servers I think I have a total of 16 toons...I think. I started playing this game so I would have someone to talk to over the age of 5 when my husband was out to sea...now I continue to play because I'm hooked. The people I meet, the places I go.....it's what I play for. Don't get me wrong, getting Alle to 60 was not something I would call easy, because for about 4 months I played 10+ hours a day....but I don't think I will be grinding on any of my others. If it happens, it happens.<br>
<br>
And that, is what I think is important about all this. Do it your own way...you are unique Imp, and you have your own style. Who cares what everyone else's agenda is. If it works for you, go for it. <br>
<br>
And for god's sake send me a tell every once in a while! <p><img src=http://home.mindspring.com/~toothfairy24/_uimages/sig3.gif></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 479<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/12/02 9:23:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The new level 60 rush.......</span><hr size=1> &quot;(need an example?... the other day in nexus..

<br>
Every once in a while it bears repeating. Nobody owes you a port. Nobody owes you a SoW. Nobody owes you a rez. Not even if you offer an extravagant sum of money. You don't &quot;deserve&quot; your epic or miscellaneous items. You don't even deserve recognition that your needs exist. You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> do</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> deserve to be treated with courtesy and fairly, but that does not impart a debt on the player(s) you seek aid from.<br>
<br>
Just like you have the right to exclude players from your help with a rez, they have the right to exclude you from their help. IMO, annotating someone to my lil’ black book because they did not take the time to SoW me is petty. There could be a number of reasons why you shouted your offer for an oh so long 10 minutes. Leave the blacklist for important shit like trains, KSes, harassment, etc., or you’ll run out of paper. <p><a href="http://spacefem.com/quiz.shtml"><img src="http://spacefemsplanet.com/mfquiz/3.jpg" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uimpudent.showPublicProfile?language=EN>impudent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/12/02 9:24:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The new level 60 rush.......</span><hr size=1> Will do hun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    (and not just when I need c3.. lol.. j/k)<br>

<br>
You can't &quot;prove&quot; an example, only offer it to bring your point across. I believe you shouted for SoW and did not receive one. I'm not placing a burden to prove it on you. I can take your word for it. But there are degrees of insult, and a &quot;one punishment for all&quot; approach is self-defeating. If anything, someone who finds occasion to point a finger every chance they get at a collective (e.g., &quot;elitists&quot;) may be using the excuse that they were hurt to vaunt on their own (ahem, Stylee). In the end, if you take every perceived slight to heart someone will lose out--you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uraluvinssteele.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raluvin Ssteele</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Krup Knight</span><br>  Posts: 280<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/12/02 10:42:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The new level 60 rush.......</span><hr size=1> I still dont think its fair to class MOST 60s as pompus/idiots/clowns or any other negative work you would like to pick.  <br>
<br>
Here's a selection of 60s that are really top people:  <br>
<br>
Treeweaver, Banelion, Driemy, Karmana, Taim, Boldair, Trevelyan, , Kromb, Khaleid, Asky, Kimja, Mobious, Fiora, Moley, Samsonn, Crysalis, Karraway, Rypem, Balily to name a few off the top of my head.  <br>
<br>
This is just a selection of classes from a lot of different guilds (yup uber guilds too) who are decent.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry you have poor experience with EQs60s in general.  <br>
<br>
Have you ever thought Impudent however,,,,, that either a) you have encountered the wrong people or b) it is not really them being snobby, its actually you coming across as being quite aggresive towards them ? <br>
<br>
Like people say its a game - level 60 characters are the same as level 1 characters - they have just progressed into the game more in certain instances.<br>

<br>
I know maybe half the people you listed, and grouped with maybe half of those..<br>
<br>
Most that know will tell you flat out, I am a VERY direct person.  And ALOT of people receive that as abrupt/abbrasive.. (not sure aggressive fits here).. <br>
<br>
I can see that.<br>
<br>
Still, I have encountered FAR more level 60's that I wish I had NEVER met, than those I am glad I did meet.<br>
<br>
To me, #'s don't lie.  If it was close... maybe.. but not by my account.<br>
<br>
Back to the original post, and my final comment on the subject.<br>
<br>
Let's all just agree to disagree.  While I still defend the position of NOT leveling to 60, due to &quot;distractions&quot;, not quitting.  Others either make that an exception, or don't see it totally.<br>
<br>
We each play our game in our own way, for our own reasons, for our own enjoyment and to complete our own agenda's.  What is good for one, most likely, will not be good for another.  And while we all should respect everyone else as a person and human being, we should also respect their point of view.  Through understanding and cooperation, anything can be acheived.  Through bickering and petty grudges, we all fail at the most simplest tasks.<br>
<br>
Again, I appologize if I un-intentionally insulted anyone. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804>Impudent Blasphemy</a><BR>

We each play our game in our own way, for our own reasons, for our own enjoyment and to complete our own agenda's. What is good for one, most likely, will not be good for another. And while we all should respect everyone else as a person and human being, we should also respect their point of view. Through understanding and cooperation, anything can be acheived. Through bickering and petty grudges, we all fail at the most simplest tasks.<br>

<br>
So mebbe those 60's agenda's didn't include givin' you a SoW &quot;right that minute&quot;.....  because they were gettin' 30 tells for SoW/SoE/Aego/KEI/whatever.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm only 53.....  and many times I either miss most of OOC chatter, or just have it turned off, since there's so much other stuff goin' on.<br>
<br>
Mayhap understanding a little more just how much stuff someone could have goin' on, could cut back a little on the aggravation co-efficient.<br>

I like variety myself.. have 4 characters over 30..  2 60 1 52 and 1 30. The 60 and the 30 are retired and relics from pre-velious.  The whole point of all this was to say.. When you stop short of 60 and go to play another class (not those who like to play different characters different days or something) you are missing an &quot;experience&quot;.. I remember when i hit 50 with my first character at the beginnings of kunark.. I shouted it with glee and passed out beer to the group.. Then months later when I hit 60.. I shouted it in big CAPS.. got lots of congrats.. and was really happy.. <br>
<br>
Granted it is different now then back then cause of AA. I still do thing that 60 is the goal at the end of the tunnel when one starts a new character.. Just like Impudent I let my words get a bit carried away and probably insulted a few casual players or those who like variety.. That wasn't my intent.  I was just trying to show people that they are missing something if they don't have 60 as a goal.. If you don't feel that way.. fine but I see 60 as the final goal when starting a new character..  The &quot;I finally made it feeling&quot; when one dings 60 should be special.. It probably took you months to get to 60 so it should be some kind of celebration.. Impudent once you get there you will see what i am talking about. <p><center>

the &quot;rush&quot; for 60 really is people with access to other toons. I dont use my friends chars to PL me anymore; i used my friend's cleric to get me lvl57 back which i deserved. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uimpudent.showPublicProfile?language=EN>impudent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/23/02 1:18:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re: The new level 60 rush.......</span><hr size=1> After taking a small amount of time to chill and think about the ENTIRE conversation...<br>
<br>
Ya know... the game at lvl 54 and teh game (as I see it) really are NOT all that different.  As a Cleric, lvl 52 appears to be the changing point.  From there on, it's all pretty much the same.<br>
<br>
1) Exp/AA group.<br>
2) Main-Tank raids with CH rotation<br>
3) Raids that are pretty much ffa (HoT), where you are changed with only your own group, or the emergency coverage of anther due to a clerics death.<br>
<br>
Sure, I dont have the buffs that higher lvl clerics do, but I have damn near the same heals (1 less I believe).  I have less hp's, less mana...<br>
<br>
But, ya know, with a server as old as Quellious, I'll never have to worry about being primary healer (or cleric leader) in almost any situation.  Thus, I have no reason to push for 60, other than personal satisfaction, but I don't want that yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And that 96% rez thing... no one ever pays for rez's anymore, so not really an arguement left that isn't for or against with sufficient weight to sway the votes..<br>

<br>
THAT used to be a major reason to get to 56 or higher for most clerics when they started the get doubts about reaching 60.<br>
<br>
My point is, aside from that one aspect, there really isn't much more of a reason to &quot;rush&quot; to 60. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804>Impudent Blasphemy</a><BR>
