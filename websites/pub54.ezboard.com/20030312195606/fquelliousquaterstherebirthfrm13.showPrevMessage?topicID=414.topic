I am usually patient enough to wait for justice to prevail.  Other times, vengence has a sweeter taste.  <br>
<br>
I met Avis/Stawker in my mid 50s.  My first personal dealing with him came when he asked me to pull Hate for him &quot;and a select group of friends&quot;.  You see, he was after his epic piece in Hate, said his guild wasn't motivated enough to get it for him.  I think at the time Stawker was his main and Avis was a twink.  I felt obligated to go since this was the RL hubby to my RL hubby's Guildleader, Opalmoon.  Never say I don't make an attempt at diplomacy.<br>
<br>
During this raid, I am introduced to Avis' vision....an elite group of 30..geared up to be able to conquer any zone (pre luclin).  Okay, I endure hearing about how screwed up Moonlite Knights is, according to Avis.  He has HIS new guild name approved already.  Think I would join MK at this point?  With the hubby of the guildleader spewing venom about his wife's guildies as a whole?<br>
<br>
Time goes by, I know my RL hubby has some issues....all guilds have issues.  But it is not my domain.  I see Avis in EC briefly, without a guild tag.  So you left MK again I see, I say.  Avis proceeds to knock MK, leads up to the fact that he'd like me to join his and Opal's new guild.  Avis says he would &quot;rape MK for the people if&quot; he had to.  LOL, those of you that know me know I am NOT guild material, over opinionated and intolerant of bull.  I can only say, I'll think about it...like hell I'll join a backstabbing assling (no offense halflings, he is a gnome).  It's always entertaining to me to see what people say when they think they have you fooled.<br>
  <br>
So RL hubby and I are camping Stormfeather, we take turns sleeping.  By then my RL hubby has left MK and Opal an Avis have joined Apostles of Insanity.  I'm at the helm of hubby's warrior because he is asleep and I can FD the monk, hehehehe.  I see Avis inquiring about his leaving MK.  Then I see...bunch of F888ers (regarding MK).  I respond, trying yet again to be diplomatic, watching for the rant I know will follow.  I am so disgusted at what I read...the BS piles up high.<br>
<br>
1. MK wouldn't let Opal on a ToV raid right after she left.   Well you know...a guildleader leaves in the middle of the night, stating that MK had gotten away from the &quot;family guild&quot; that Opal had wanted.  They needed time away from the guild, they needed time to pursue the things they wanted *cough Destiny's Fire cough*.  Then not two days after she leaves, wants to come back and raid with that guild in ToV.  I think a little restriction is in order.<br>
<br>
2. MK won't let Opal and Avis back into the guild, a guild that Opal had built.  Hmmm come to find out, 3 days after they leave MK, they wanted back in IF the guild leadership was handed Stawker/Avis.  Guess they couldn't &quot;rape&quot; MK of enough people.  Ohhh yeah, a guild is gonna let a guy,who obviously has issues with them, back in control? <br>
<br>
3.  MK didn't want their twinks to be officers.  So, you leave a guild, guild your mains with another guild, and you want to leave a twink as an officer?<br>
<br>
The next day, I get a tell from Opal (like I'm too stupid to know that Avis plays her most of the time).  They had left AoI, formed that Elite Uber guild they envisioned.  They want me to join.  Yet again I am diplomatic, thoroughly disgusted at two people who drove a guild to their benefit with the knowledge that one day, they would abandon that guild for their &quot;hand selected people&quot;.  Opal says she'll recruit her &quot;friends&quot; from MK.  I pretty much brush her off.<br>
<br>
I sent a message to Nemglani, MK's new guild leader.  I tell him what I've heard, I wanted to know if the accusations were true.  Most of all, I wanted him to know what I was hearing.  I suspected other people were being fed the same BS.  Nem, Avis and I had a channel set up, me playing moderator...and the truth came out.<br>
<br>
I joined MK, there are wonderful people there...Wakit, Bugrom, Miina, Eternalruby, Karnuk, Zarhana, Eeirey, Taaxi, Chappu and so on...although I have detagged, I think they are a good group of people as a whole.  And since I am gone for MK and Destiny's Fire has collapsed, I felt like it was time to say my piece.  They are now recruiting with Wraith.  I know my rant won't influence Droz, considering I told him that Keluli was a bitch cleric (another story)  and she got in Wraith anyway (granted he's booping her in RL from what I hear) :P<br>
<br>
And as I told Avis before I placed him and Opal and all their known twinks on ignore...remember when you said...nahh I didn't say that...hmm...I have screenshots....screenshots are a wonderful thing...pretty dragons (me and Harla Dar)...conversations....<br>
<br>
This is for all the people you used to get where you are Avis...this is for all the &quot;F888ers&quot; you abandoned, lied to, lied about.....this is for being what I despise most in EQ....a lying manipulative USER.  Hackers/scammers may steal your gear, you stole people's time to follow your own personal agenda while talking sh8t about them.   <br>
<br>
And this may not affect any of you guys that regularly post here, but this is &quot;the public forum&quot; for Quellious so I chose here for optimal viewing.  Flame away Avis and Opal, show those true colors.  <br>

I don't know you. After reading this post which resembles the writings of a deranged maniac I can only thank my lucky stars. <br>
<br>
From the sound of your post, these 2 had some issues in MK, left to start a new guild, but didnt work out. Wow you're right. What assholes !!! lol !!<br>
<br>
I do know what an asset Keluli was from when we were still vulnerable in the start till recently when she quit EQ and from reading your comment, I can only thank Droz he ignored you and I'll follow his lead. <br>
<br>
Good day (doesn't sound like you have many of those)<br>

You don't try to delete a guild website when you do.  You don't spread lies about the people that you called friends for 2 yrs.  And you call ME deranged *shrug*.  Thorwald is right, it's my personal opinion, I wasn't in MK when this occurred.  AS to my holier than thou attitude, yes I have a tendency to pass judgement on people that screw others over, you think I'm a maniac for that?  Am I being vindictive, hell yes, although Avis did nothing more than lie to me and be manipulative, he sums up all that I dislike about this game.  <br>
<br>
I have no desire to start a guild, a small caring guild is one thing but guilds are full of people with the mememe attitude.  You don't know me and honestly, your opinion of me doesn't upset me.  I related something that happened.  You don't want to believe it *shrug*<br>
<br>
As to Keluli, hmmm I didn't find her an asset to my groups that she gated out of groups when things looked bad.  I didn't find her an asset when a friend of mine died in her group, she disbanded him, replaced him and didn't res him for over an hour.  I didn't think she was an asset when she missed heals when she was too busy looting every mob that dropped.  I didn't think she was an asset when she gated on a EW group and never came back to rez us.  So I'm a bitch for relating that to Droz?  *shrug*<br>
<br>
Yeah, I slam people....always funny that there's people out there get bent all out of shape when someone speaks the truth and calls it mud slinging gossip.  Maybe you should reflect on how many flames I actually start about people, and give me the benefit of considering it the truth.<br>

WTF ??  Can you say two faced ?  Why did you never tell me and Avis your true feelings of us ? Why act like our friend ??  God damn if you dont like me tell me dont act like you do ...I have done nothing but be nice to you.  <br>
<br>
Makes me wonder who else hates my guts and been calling me sis//friend all this time ..<br>
<br>
I dont put on an act I am who I am take me as I am or leave me but dont talk behind my back ...WE never asked any of MK that came to DF to come they asked US ...I still have many many friends in MK ..Thorwald you are still my bro just because we left MK doesnt mean we dont like any of you less and those I call sister/friend is what they are to me ..I would never say anything mean about one I call a friend ...<br>
<br>
The true story of MK was that I saw greed. complaints..noone showing for raids on time ..Ninja looting from a recruit when our rules were recruits could roll on certain things when a recruit won on a roll two guildmembers stole from her ..Officers were involved ..and all they could say about it was they didnt think the recruit deserved it ...WELL damnit she did and by our rules at the time she should have got it period .. I didnt build MK to turn into a bunch of loot hungry assholes !!!  Most of them werent but if I would have kicked those that were I would have had to dealt with more stress then I was already having to deal with as being the leader of a guild especially the one of the size of MK was hard enuf .. I made alot of wrong decisions in who I made officers too ...Some turned out to be drill seargents telling people what to do and @#%$ ... what was I supposed to do demote them ? and get my ass ripped apart  ...<br>
as far as avis and I only coming back to MK if he was made leader that is crap ! Nemglani the person I gave guild to was already trying to find a new leader for it cuz he was already sick of the BS after 3 days or a week or whatever ..Avis was gonna take it back and kick the jerks from it thats the truth.<br>
<br>
And as far as avis USING people thats BS is we were using people to get items etc dont you think he would have gotten his epic a lil soon hell some of MK didnt even wanna help him .. you have no idea how much money he put into MK buying coffins for CR and @#%$ when some of Mk didnt even care and treated him like @#%$ ...NO I am not talking about all of MK I am saying some of MK ...<br>
<br>
So its like this if we call you sis /friend/ bro you are that to us ..if we have you on ignore we dont like you you have stabbed us in the back .. <br>
<br>
and no I would never go back to MK now I was gonna going to but a person I trusted Miina invited a person I have hated in this game for the past 3 yrs Marklar into MK .. knowing full well I hated his guts and would never come back if he was there ...and yes miina your on ignore too you two faced bitch!<br>
<br>
And I will say just one more thing ...Recruiting with wraith this past week has been the most fun I have had in game in a long time ..seeing new things going new places and meeting new people .. and no my oppinion of wraith before actually being with them was not good, I thought of them as just another uber guild that ks's and stuff ...Now I feel way different ..Wraith is a group of great people that know their @#%$ and how to take on the biggest mobs and not fail !! And I would be honored to be a part of them and Avis too.<br>
<br>
one last thing /IGNORE Arianwen /tear<br>

you've known me for a long time and  that I was still friends with Marklar.  and ya he has an Ego the size of Ragefire himself  but I always thought eventualy I could mend things between you two,,,  time heals all wounds. <br>
( well I thought they did till this mess).<br>
That man has driven me to tears on more than one occasion.<br>
he invited me into MK those, ( wow it has been  that long!) 3 years ago.  <br>
I remember you  leaving and I didnt play EQ for 2 days I was  shook so bad over it. <br>
figured all you wanted was a few days to figure out what was breaking your heart in MK.<br>
then  the following day I logged on and clicked my friends button, and both you and avis were listed in AoI. <br>
It stung but I figured you found a new home and was happy.<br>
I was glad you found a place to heal.<br>
<br>
then that evening  Marklar sent a tell that he needed a friend to talk too, as he left VoR over some mess with Legolez.<br>
always thought the folks at VoR were super nice. <br>
(hello all you happy Spork people <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
I also saw had you torn completly out of MK and into a new guild and as an officer in it to boot.<br>
and another friend of 3 years  guildless.<br>
I told him I would not  just invite him,  what I did was tell him to come through the initiation process and if everyone voted him in  we would be more than welcome to accept him in.<br>
<br>
a week and a half went by,,  both of you still AoI<br>
still no tell to me, the trusted friend, that you were returning.<br>
I figured if one friend left MK and the other was without guild,<br>
why not tell him to give the recrutment thingy a try.<br>
<br>
you and avis both for that matter have stuck up for me more than once, as has marklar on many occasions. I still miss ya. heck when I was sending you the tell about him just getting the Vote back in,  I sent you a tell about 3 seconds after it passed,,, unanimously within the chat room.<br>
<br>
you told me alot of the bad eggs had left MK and it was shaping up and that we would get things right again soon,<br>
then I asked you if you were sitting down, because I Knew this would start something,  but I had hoped to discuss it with you friend to friend before he was Invited back into the guild. <br>
- thats right hun, he wasnt invited in yet on that day the board and the Website went away. he wasnt invited till 2 days after that.<br>
 <br>
was I trying to keep you from comming back?<br>
no, dear I was trying to tell you what was going on.<br>
15 minutes later you were gone,   telling me in your last tell<br>
that you were removing your twinks<br>
I wasnt done asking you if you would chat with me about it, <br>
I was trying to let you know since you had moved on to a new guild and was an officer already in AoI.<br>
I guess im a two faced (meanie) for asking another friend that left to try and come back,  why have both my friends out of guilds,  I didnt think you would come back.<br>
I may play a cleric but Do'nt read minds well. <br>
the next time you were on line I was on IGNORE.<br>
<br>
<br>
the ironic thing is I havent seen Marklar online in over 3 weeks. <br>
<br>
well  opal (yes I almost said sis again)  I still think of you as such, and I truly hope some day you can let the hate go away,  I still love you and Avis both.<br>
well I Love Ari too  but damn it I seem to get stuck in the middle of things because im friends with both and have to choose , one friend over another that I cant do.<br>
<br>
Take care my friend,<br>
and Avis?<br>
I dont think you are a despicable gnome<br>
and wish you and Opal well in Wraith<br>
I'm sure Matt  and you guys are gonna have some fun times.<br>

We were never officers in AoI who ever told you that lied.<br>
<br>
Bugrom  I called you son once,  You and Avis have had your moments but you guys always seemed to make up .. I think it was your holier that thou attitude about what you wanted from MK and always pulling you tantrums that finally broke the straw on the camels back so to say with your relationship with Avis.  Without you I would not to this day have my epic you pushed me and pushed me to get it we climbed that mountain together and with the help of our friends in MK we succeeded and I seem to remember a lil gnome that put in many hrs at your camp as well as mine.<br>
<br>
Avis did things for you all the time as you did for him .. <br>
<br>
So just think about those things before you go and spout your mouth off about Avis.<br>
