It's not my responsibility to spend hours and hours to go back and pull quotes from every single post you've made in the thread (that seems to be your forte).... you made a comment which indicated that resorting to personal slurs was lame, yet you seem to have no reservations about making such comments yourself.  If it's lame when others do it then it's lame for you to make them back, plain and simple.  You can go ahead and make &quot;adolescent calibre slurs&quot; about people all day long, I really could care less, but don't get up on your soapbox and pretend it's only wrong when others do it.  Make them in retort and play that way or refrain from it completely and then use that to show just how mature and intellectually superior you seem to think you are.  Don't retort with lame slurs and then diss on people for doing it as well.<br>

Highly doubt it though since the MB team will just come in and take it from them. They did remove the penalty with moving targets not making the dot do less damage. Even making some of the Dot spells in the up coming patch to be changed to unresistable.<br>
<br>
Sure it will take longer than the one second it takes for all of the MBs to land (I know that MB has a 6.5 casting time, but she doesn't know you're casting it until it lands).<br>
<br>
Dream team: One level 60 warrior decked with the top of the line gear possible, fully buffed and 5 rangers with the plane of sky bow, Windstiker. I know a lot will disagree with the bow to use because of the massive delay but hear me out. Trueshot disc. works heavely on the delay of the bow. It wasn't like this back then and so rangers with 20 delay bows where out damaging rangers with higher delay bows by nearly double. Verant fixed (nerfed) it to where the higher the delay, the bigger the crits. With it also being the highest damage bow in the game, the crits will be into the 2,000 (this has been proven). Next is the proc that the bow itself has. The proc is a 100dd, 5 second stun unresistable. Draw back is that it levitates the mob during the duration of the stun, which is only one foot off the ground. Considering that Gore will be immune to the stun effect, levi will not be a problem. What the proc will do is interrupt any spell she is casting during that time. I expect the rangers to have 255 dex so proccing should be constant.<br>
<br>
This is my thought and you all are welcome to dispute it at will. I will again state that it depends on luck and how well the warrior can keep aggro. The battle can turn for the worse in a very short time but that's the chance a non-MB group takes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usephrokdapathfinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sephrok da Pathfinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/21/02 10:32:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=546>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> 1.  Bow procs are very rare<br>
2.  Stun &amp; Levi components wont stick on gore and on top of that wont interupt her spells.<br>
3.  Primal bow is the best dps bow in the game.. bow from PoA is just for looking cool with high crits.<br>
4.  Warrior will get feared / slowed.. if not, die before that... aggro would be impossible.. you can't hold aggro while feared because the server thinks your LD.. so gore would go directly for the rangers.<br>
<br>
As for taking dragons with DoTs... you need to be in meele range to cast DoTs.. and once gore starts taking dmg she starts summoning.. the DoT casters wouldn't last long.. once they are all dead and no one has aggro on Gore, she'd regen to full instantly like most ubermobs do when they aren't currently fighting.  Oh that reminds me.. regen on kunark dragons is quite high, too bad thats another ability that is obsolete that VI gave them to make them tougher.. since MB..<br>
<br>
But, all those methods are legit, seeing as how in all cases Gore's abilities serve some purpose, her regen, her AEs, her melee... etc.. when your MBing they might as well be a fricken giant rat... hence why im pushing for the 5s mb buff, still makes it just as useful but you ca'nt kill'em instantly.. <p><center>

Not like a melee weapon that can swinging a dozen times in a few seconds.<br>
<br>
I was on the very first Vox raid this server ever had. We all ran into battle not worrying about how we were going to stop her healing. We thought since stun doesn't work on her why bother? She comp healed herself three times before the raid failed. The next day another Vox raid was done but this time we were intended to stop that casting. Each time stun landed it stopped her spell casting making it for the first time ever on this server, Vox was slained. Stun won't stop Gore from attacking but it will stop the casting, just like in the Vox raid.<br>
<br>
I agree 100% that primal bow is the best hands down. My post didn't state that windstiker was the best, it only stated as the highest damage. When fighting a mob that only has 32k hp you need to do the most damage possible because the fight will only last a few seconds. You are right with the &quot;looking cool with high crits&quot; and why I believe those high crits can take down Gore pretty fast.<br>
<br>
From my experience dragon fear wasn't all that hard to resist but if the thought of the warrior getting feared bothers you, can always get a paladin to do it. Not only do they have LoH but they can become immune to fear.<br>
<br>
I am only thinking of ways to kill Gore without the use of MB since others here have been wondering what other one group could take her down. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufaithkills.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faithkills</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/21/02 1:39:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=548>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Lets make a bet FK, you get 4 other rangers and a bard and i'll take part in your little test.

Warcry 3 war will not get feared probably before gore died. He will probably die himself, but not get feared. AE taunt should hold aggro over archers at 400 range.<br>
<br>
Primal bow is great but lower range. I'd like 250 range bows so theres more range leeway, but primal would do. range 150 or better arrows.<br>

<br>
Search FoH msg boards for facts on Warcry 3 and how much of a joke it is.<br>
<br>
&quot;AE taunt should hold aggro over archers at 400 range&quot;<br>
<br>
When the war gets feared ( he will ), archers get aggro.. and do you know how AE taunt works? AE taunt isn't a normal-liek taunt.. all it does is put the warrior on top of the hate list, if anyone does any dmg before the war does, they'll get aggro.. i dont see how AE taunt will help at all in that situation, but whatever, its you're 10k.<br>
<br>
Pika.. if the mob in question only had like 10k hp, then yes, the first initial hit being a high damage hit (like it SHOULD be with that windstriker) would be good.. but Gore will likely last 30 seconds (or even more).. in that case primal would do more damage over that time frame..  and btw.. 2k crits are true, but rare..  my max crit with Primal is ~ 1888 so far.. and i've only gotten that crit once.. and only a few 1700 or so crits over the course of WEEKS.... a nice crit within a 30s timeframe would be alot of luck.. and we can't really rely on luck as a viable way of killing Gore.<br>
<br>
Would you rather hit a mob for 500 dmg 4 times in 10 seconds, or 750 dmg twice in 10 seconds?  More damage is only good for the initial hit, from there its about DPS.. which is why primal would be the best choice. <p><center>

I am not guilty of doing the same thing. If Sephrok keeps up with the insults however I will put him in the same category as Montyy, if that's where he wants to be.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking IMO the impression one gives when one makes personal attacks is that one's reasoning ability is insufficient to the task one is engaged in. Which is why in general I prefer not to go there. You may disagree.<br>

Yes, I thought about that. Still am thinking. There's tradeofs. WC3 would give 15 sec for the whole group. But with 350-400 range archers fear (and any ae) may be able to be factored out. Also the other problem is that after Behemoth bitched about it, it may be difficult to FIND anyone that wasted 18AA on WC3.. and WC1 would be pointless. I know how AE taunt is seems to work, but even if it bought the rangers a few extra seconds that would be worth it.<br>
<br>
Whereas a fearless pally should not be too hard to find. And with LoH (especially improved LoH, and possibly a DA) should survive a bit.. but can he hold aggro? I suspect if the archers are out at 400 he might.<br>
<br>
Thinking it through I think you are correct, Pally would be the best bet. (which would be hilarious if it works<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Well there's the seeds of an experiment. If anyone is bothering to read this for purposes other than to flame and meets the prereqs and would not mind receiving a tell sometime to try to kill gore, say so. Needed 5 am3/eq rangers and a fairly tough <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> fearless</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pally.<br>
<br>
(hmm.. is there anything generally available faster than a fleeting quiver?)<br>
<br>
Anyway it won't lose.. I'll be there to finish it if it comes to that.. and I'm sure there will be lots of spectators.. but I'm sure curious to see if it can work without any help.<br>

<br>
Lets summarize:<br>
<br>
I say 5 people shouldnt be able to kill a dragon, you say they should since they have high AA and that a group of ANY high AA toons can do the same (yet to be proven)<br>
<br>
You say we all should be worried about chanters raking in cash soloing in the kael arena.  Myself, Sephrok, and Salta (DC chanter Im guessing) as well as a few other folks say that you can't make any money there...yet you say we're all full o'crap.<br>
<br>
You argue with Sephrok (a ranger with 60+ AA) about what his class can and can't do...yeah what does he know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You argue that all mobs are trivial now due to CH...hmm well I guess you've never fought some SoL mobs...kill some then tell me how trivial they are with out without CH (that Glyphed AE FD proc is a pain in the butt...lol).<br>
<br>
You state that killing kunark dragons with MB will be the prefered method....yet people who need epic drops (wars/bards/pallys) have posted here that they would rather WORK for their epic and not have to get a wizard to do it for them.<br>
<br>
You argue on a different thread that people should respect the clerics 'list' because its their epic and therefore they should control it, yet you control the flow of other classes epic drops by constantly burning Dragons.<br>
<br>
Many people, including myself, have come here to say that they feel manaburn an unblanacing ability (limited to kunark mobs) due to the fact that a small group of one class can accomplish what no other class can.....you're only reply to this was that we have class envy and that the only problem now is guilds are kicking themselves for slighting wizards in the past /shrug<br>
<br>
Personally I think this comes down to you having one of the largest egos I have ever had the displeasure of encountering.... That, combined with a complete lack of an open mind to even consider that someone else MAY be right besides yourself (OMG!) To this point, even after many people have stated many well thought out opinions about this topic, you have failed to recognize the validity of any of them, instead you just twist things around in a multitude of annoying quotes.<br>
<br>
Oh well, thats it for now...Guess I should go make some popcorn and sit back and watch the quotes fly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Heh, maybe I can make some bets with Sephrok to see just what you will to attempt to pull out of the recesses of your arse next <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And i'm not so much against small groups of people doing the kunark dragons ( may have said it earlier, but after alot of thought, thats not the case) .. just them dieing instantly to MB... thats what i dont like.. and they should at least be able to use their god-given abilities. <p><center>
