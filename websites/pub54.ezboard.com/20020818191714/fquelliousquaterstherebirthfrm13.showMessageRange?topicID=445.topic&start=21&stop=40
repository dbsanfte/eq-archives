America did not have to live through the horror of modern warfare in its cities and villages the way Europe did.  America for the past 30 years has been able to view war as some perverse kind of political entertainment.  Internally, America loves guns, big muscles, and bravado.  European countries had to learn they could not be so aggressive and live in peace with each other; America thinks war is something it can afford, something that will ultimately never ever ravage its towns and countrysides.  America, in other words, has yet to learn what Europe learned at the end of WW2.<br>
<br>
American politicians learned in the 80's that playing up machismo and militarism wins elections.  American politicians are deathly afraid of being painted as &quot;unpatriotic,&quot; but where patriotism means aggressive, macho, and ready for war as if it aint no big thang.  European citizens and politicians, in contrast, know that war is hell.<br>
<br>
America's inclination toward war and militarism is not Bush's fault; he is just another in a line of right-wing (and sadly, today even left-wing) demagogues who play to the American people's own shallow ignorance about how horrific and evil global aggressiveness is.  I will aggree, however, that Bush personifies the typical American ignorance of how evil war is.  Its as if its all game and posture.  All this stems from the fact that the American soul knows this: war will never touch its own land, so it is all kind of distant and abstract.  <br>
<br>
Does Iraq deserve to be invaded?  Perhaps yes indeed.  But as an American, what disturbs me is how glibly the American psyche these days embraces war, agression, slaughter, bombing, the sending in of our young soldiers with their incredible weapons.  Europe learned at the end of WW2 that male machismo and war-liking can no longer be the basis of a national identity.  America never learned that lesson.  We like our actors to have rippling muscles and big guns, and to shoot first and ask questions later; and we like our government to be the same way, it seems.  <br>
<br>
Too much testosterone over here in the US.  Sadly, until America learns of the true horror of war, it is all too likely we will go on thinking that there is no such thing as too much testosterone.<br>

I said that we have not suffered to the extent that others have at the hands of terrorism. My point being that using our suffering as justification for Bombing the shit out of anything that moves, including the elderly in Afganistan, or staging an all out war against Sadam for &quot;harboring terrorists&quot; is moronic.<br>
<br>
That my friend is stupidity at its finest. Retaliating to terrorism with terror, fevor, and anger is retaliating with terrorism. Not a very good way to bring an end to terrorism. Bush is acting with fanaticism, some of histories finest leaders and organizations act with fatacism: Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Stalin, Sadam, Bush #1, Bush #2, the dude in central europe that kept the Kosavars in limbo,(if I could remember his name I couldn't spell it right anyway), Ho Chi Min, the KKK, the Black Panthers, Islamic Fundamentalists in Bengladesh, the Chinese towards Tibet and Mayanmar, ect...  Which one of these leaders was not dealt with by puting the world in utter disarry and chaos? None. Which one of these was dealt with by not instituting the same kind of methods that they use? None. Violence breeds Violence, making it perpetual which is why the mideast, central-east europe, Africa and most of the asian continent are still fighting the same fights from THOUSANDS of years ago. We should learn from the messages we preach and from the actions of those in the past and evaluate alternatives to GI Joe tactics to solving problems. After all that was the message at the end of the cartoons.<br>

After reading this post, it makes more sense to me what your point was/is.  But the first time, I took it, right or wrongly, as they didn't have a right to feel the way they did.  Understood now what your point is.  Don't agree, but understand.<br>
<br>
I see one problem with what you are saying, you don't think bombing, fighting or whatever else that includes vilence is correct in dealing with them.  My question to you is, what would be a more viable solution?  Al'Qaeda, Saddam and the numerous others, we have had no luck dealing with for different reasons.  Al'Qaeda?  Why would you want to deal with them?  What could you possibly do besides killing them that would stop what they do?  Saddam, again, why/what?  The man is just waiting for the chance to strike out with a mass destruction weapon.<br>

I'd really like to hear what you feel is valid options in this because I personally do not see any. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>

BTW Mohogani, he didn't win the electoral college per se, he was appointed president by the supreme court who awarded him the state of Florida, thereby giving him a victory in the electoral college, but thats soooo two years ago.  Oh, and Reagen won the cold war by ballooning military spending by siphoning all money away from important domestic programs resulting in a massive debt.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if half of the bush administration would put down their bibles and pick up a history book they might actually learn something useful.  War NEVER stops killing, it only redirects who's being killed.  <br>
<br>
The Iraqies dont attack the US cause they are just genetically preprogramed to hate all americans, as some news agencies might seem have you think.  They are pissed off because the U.S. has been extremely exploitive and manipulative in their dealings with Mideast countries.  We demand that they let us get their oil, but at the same time have the nerve to demand that they comply to our ways.  If your friend loses his job and you let him come live YOUR house, then he starts complaining about how your bed isn't made, orders you to prepare him a special vegetarian meal for dinner, then whines cause you didn't put enough lettuce on the salad, and then refuses to leave when you ask, you're not gonna be to happy either.  Jebus, he's in YOUR house ordering YOU around!  Thats the situation in the middle east and Sadaam is the only one that said &quot;No, I'm not going to tolerate this, get out&quot;.  We're so friggin addicted to their oil nipple we just cant let go yet we continue to try and order these countries around like THEY are the ones in OUR territory.  Thats no kind of negotiating position!  As long as we're stuck on the oil, there's no way there will ever be peace between the middle east and the U.S..  Taking out Sadaam aint gonna fix a damn thing.  Until we ween ourselves off that dope, we're going to be dependant on mideast oil, and thus, unable to negotiate in a reasonable manner.  <br>
<br>
We claim that Sadaam is some kind of living satan, and that no other people in the world suffer as much as those in Iraq.  The government tries to pass this off as a humanitarian mission and that we are freeing the oppressed people of Iraq and that once Sadaam is dead, the Iraqi women will be free to rip off their veils, and dance gidily around in the streets, a la Juilie Andrews in the sound of music, while the men and the children clap their hands to the beat of the uptemo sitar music and the world will be free of oppression and tyrany forever!  Sorry, not gonna happen.  The fact of the matter is this, there are places in the world where conditions are immesureably more deplorable than in Iraq.  For instance, lets take Uganda.  There you have a military general declaring genocide upon another tribe.  Millions slaughtered, but nobody in the U.S. gives a shit.  Why?  Because they dont have any oil do they.  They have nothing we need.  The Iraq mission isn't about being humanitarian, its about oil.<br>
<br>
Oh but we're in luck, thanks to the supreme court we've got an oil man in the white house, actually, LOTS of oil men!  Surely they'll want to help us become less dependant on foreign oil.  I really love their plan to spend 10 years and 40 bagillion million dollars building an oil pipeline up in the Alaskan wilderness to get a 6 month supply of oil so that we'll be free of foreign oil between January and July of 2012!  Thats just the kind of inginuity and forward thinking thing we need.<br>
<br>
No I'm not a Sadaam lover so dont start flaming me like I'm some kind of traitor.  Clearly the way he choses to go about fighting back at the U.S. is nowhere near the top of the &quot;good things to do&quot; list.  I am simply pointing out the often overlooked issues that are present in this situation.  Remember, when you're pointing the finger at someone, you've got 3 pointing back at you.  We as a country seem to forget that a lot.<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Anyway, the first thing that needs to be done is a huge increase towards the development of alternative fuel sources.  We can't negotiate effectively as long as we're dependant on oil from the region.  Then...maybe if we redirected some of this inflated military spending towards domestic and international aid programs, diplomatic relations initiatives, and public schools, we might one day raise a generation capable of dealing with conflict through less barbaric means.  One can only hope.<br>

No Bubba, I was talking about the post you were responding to. I think I was so flabbergasted that I forgot to name the perp. Sorry.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not think history will be kind to Reagan. We had really little to do with winning the cold war as much the internal contradictions of the Soviet System had in losing it.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Shrug* It's all a matter of opinion. We've had 20 years since Reagan first started swinging and polls still show him as being considered one of the greatest presidents of all time. Then again, Reagan was a rebound president much like Bush II. The country was rebounding from the absolute dearth of leadership in the Carter admin.<br>
<br>
Internal contradictions may have been a problem, but without pressure from the outside, flawed systems can continue to exist for quite some time. The Reagan admin destroyed the Soviet Machine by out-producing it. The out-production bankrupted the Sovs and allowed internal dissent to flower. Without the resources drawn away from internal policing, the Sovs would likely still have the same system as previously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Reagan's biggest accomplishment was in changing a merely huge deficit to an unbelievably enormous one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Feh. At the time, it was what was needed. Do you think we would have had the prosperity of the late 80's through 2000 were it not for what Reagan started? <br>
<br>
As to people still bitching about this non-existant war, does anyone have any backing to show that it is anything more than talk, or is everyone bleating like worried sheep and believing the empty sabre-rattling? <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

Good old Neville thought that Hitler could be reasoned with. Just give him enough concessions and he'll be satisfied. I guess after all because the Sundentenland wasn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> British</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> territory.<br>
<br>
The US wanted no part of that situation. They delayed getting involved until thier hand was forced... and Europe sufferred terribly for that delay.

As regard europeans, especially British being cowards. Horseshit. I do believe Chamberlain had no stones, he was a disaster for Europe, but certainly Churchill's and British resolve in the conflict cannot be questioned.<br>
<br>
I think it is disingenuous to say that the US joined the conflict for purely selfish reasons. Hitler would have gladly agreed to leave the US alone in return for their noninterference. It would almost certainly been a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> lie</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but if we had a dove in office at the time they could have believed it. We'd certainly have had been left alone for a while anyway. Which would have been a complete world disaster in the making. Probably the US would have remained independent the longest but not likely forever once he consolidated europe and was able to devote his forces to the east. I don't think Russia would have held out in this case.<br>
<br>
As for Bill Clinton.. he was responsible for the debacles of US intervention in Somalia and Bosnia. Which IMO was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> our business.<br>
<br>
Neither directly impacted American interests. If the US really felt there was a situation that needed to be adressed we should have presented the information to the UN and said we'll be happy to do something about it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> if you ask us to</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>

I like to blame Clinton, because turn about is fair play.  Liberals blame Republicans for all the evils in the world with no substantiating evidence.  So, I choose to blame Clinton (well Hilary since Bill is just a puppet of Hilary's), because I can.<br>

We have the liberals ranting again that Bush did not win the election. We have the peaceniks decrying Bush for a war that doesn't exist. We have oddballs analyzing why the American psychology somehow makes it a global aggressor. Then we have one of the all-time stupidities, &quot;Violence breeds violence&quot;.<br>
<br>
It's getting deep in here.<br>
<br>
A) Can we maybe agree that whether or not you believe that Bush won legitimately or not, that it has NOTHING to do with ANY discussion here? It's a null issue, people. Bitch all you want about the Supreme Court, but the decision is made.<br>
<br>
B) The war does not exist. It has not happened. It is not even particularly getting prepared for. I live in what is very likely the largest concentration of American Military forces on the East Coast (Hampton Roads area in Virginia), and it is dead obvious around here when a build-up is occurring. You get a massive influx of troops and gear, neither of which we are seeing. I simply do not believe this proposed war on Iraq is anything real at this point. It is a threat, nothing more.<br>
<br>
C) Our psychology is violent? Scuse me? Since when does this matter, and what culture isn't psychologically violent? I happen to have history books, modern ones, what show your peaceful Europeans as being FAR more aggressive than we in the last century alone. As a superpower, we've been positively angelic. So we like guns, muscles, and such. Whee! We're so frikken evil. For every example of American aggression globally, I can point out nigh-unbelievable numbers of aggressions by other so-called peaceful nations throughout the history of the world. Everyone is aggressive when their interests are threatened. Noone is clean of that &quot;stain&quot;. <br>
<br>
D) Violence breeds violence. Yup, and Peaceniks breed victims. And? <br>

BTW Mohogani, he didn't win the electoral college per se, he was appointed president by the supreme court who awarded him the state of Florida, thereby giving him a victory in the electoral college, but thats soooo two years ago. Oh, and Reagen won the cold war by ballooning military spending by siphoning all money away from important domestic programs resulting in a massive debt.<br>

<br>
The Electoral College has been around for a looong time, Bush used it to his advantage and Gore ignored it.  Why did the supreme court have to make a decision in the first place?  Bush won Florida, so by all rights he gets all of Florida's votes.  When one of them refused to cast her vote, then it had to be litigated.  It only came to that because of sore losers.  I only brought it up because Bubba mentioned it first.<br>
<br>
So, at least you admit Reagan won the Cold War.  Thanks to him we don't have to fear Mutually Assured Destruction and all that BS.  He destroyed the &quot;Evil Empire&quot;, thank-you Mr President.  Now, we can look at becoming allies with Russia, a much better solution than a real war.  I would do the same thing by spending money to save lives.<br>

<br>
The point your missing is the hipocrasy that Bush exudes. <br>
<br>
Fact: Bush is on a mission against terrorism, and those that harbor terrorists.<br>
<br>
Fact: The U.S. has hit civilian installations in its many attempts to &quot;right the wrongs&quot; made against others and our selves. Examples include but are not limited to; countless villages in Vietnam, the Chinese Embassy, &quot;an old folks home&quot; in Afganistan, countless civilian buildings in Iraq and Afganistan, and who knows what else!<br>
<br>
Fact: Most of these transgressions occured in conflicts not wars.<br>
<br>
Fact: The laws that others violate, but the U.S. is immune to are written by the U.S. under the pen name of the U.N. and other &quot;multilateral international organizations&quot;.<br>
<br>
My point is that Bush is trying to elminate terrorism with even more terrorism. The only difference is that he is terrorising non-americans. That is hipocracy(sp?) at its finest friend. He is, at best, a blubbering fool when it comes to foreign relations, demonstrated by the fallout of relations and fallout of peace in the mideast since his arival at the white house. <br>
<br>
Saying that violence breeds violence is a studitiy in this case, is just wrong, not to mention you don't really give a reason to not act like a hot head. Thats why the nations leaders are there to stop the &quot;fanatcism&quot; that comes with peoples interests being at risk. That is why they are called negotiations, and peace talks. I agree terrorists shouldn't be negotiated with, but Bush doesn't negotiate with anything/anyone that is what makes him a poor president. <br>
<br>
And its Tom Daschel, the next president of the U.S. unless a Kennedy is reincarnated.<br>

Military is probably our only viable answer for the al queda but not Bush style hard nosed bull. It will only create more response along the same lines as Sept. 11th, and it already has.<br>
