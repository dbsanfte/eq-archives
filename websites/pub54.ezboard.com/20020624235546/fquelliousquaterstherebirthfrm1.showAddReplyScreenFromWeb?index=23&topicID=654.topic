We were there faithfully 24/7 the whole time. At times we may have had a few people, but that was brief, and in the wee hours of the morning. One time for about an hour during the whole Rage camp there were only two of us. And we had lots of friends to support us as well. We made sure that no one ever left the cleric alone.<br>
<br>
Here is the way it worked then, and I am sure it is probably still working this way:<br>
<br>
Interested parties, guildies, and friends help camp Ragefire. Generally a cleric who is ready to step up to bat next spawn will lend their support. When the time comes to restart camp after he has been killed, the cleric claims the spawn, along with a good force of guildies/friends to help establish it. It was never once stated in the way the camp has been going that ONE cleric is camping it. The Ragefire camp requires the support of a cleric's whole guild, and their friends. Otherwise it is doomed to fail. That is when the KSing issues have arisen most often. <br>
<br>
In the event that 2 or more clerics want the camp, they *gasp* work it out honorably. Hard to believe isn't it? And I would imagine on this &quot;list&quot; that if the next one who is aiming to camp it really wants to camp it, they will make sure they are there lending a hand the week before, otherwise, they kinda lose claim to it. <br>
<br>
This system, while not official, and by no means is the &quot;list&quot; set in stone, is working because the clerics have taken control of their epics and have figured out the best possible solution for a crappy situation. Is it perfect? Probably not. Can it be superceded by dishonorable people who want to waste 6 days hard spent by a cleric and those supporting him/her? Yes. But with such teamwork, it reduces the chances of such a thing, and builds a sense of teamwork.<br>
<br>
/flame incoming...<br>
<br>
Before you people start bashing a player evolved way of working together for one of the most contested and fought over spawns, I suggest you spend a week helping out these clerics to see what it is like. Spend 36 hours awake selflessly helping to keep the cleric sane (many friends did this without any expectations of anything in return) before you open your mouth about something you have no idea about. <br>
<br>
Don't taint this show of solidarity between clerics with past events and the &quot;rules&quot; and your own worthless opinion of something you know nothing of. <br>

Acturian.. that's what I'm saying.. a shaman can keep a tank healed a lot longer than a cleric.. least a 60 shammy can.... he doesn't do a cheal, but you would be amazed how long a shammy can keep mana going with torpor/cann<br>
<br>
<br>
Whytspirit summed it up best... after a given camping cleric gets the spawn, it's up to the others that want the next spawn to work it out honorably.... that does not automatically mean next on a player-made list... <br>
<br>
Q-man (not gonna spell that on memory) seems to have the attitude that helped break the old QQ system, I'm not sure if  he was around back in those days.  One of the big factors in it's folding was when the reservation committe started taking itself as an authority.  The old &quot;why should Vis/LC be treated different than anyone else under the system&quot; argument that didn't really work since the guilds chose not to be part of the system.  The first thing I suggested as part of that committe when Vis started farming Trak/Venril was suggest we (the guilds that used the reservation system) work out a collective deal with Vis to share spawns.  It was shot down immediately, and IMO accellerated the eventual shut down of the system. <br>
<br>
If a Wraith cleric decides its' time to get into teh ragefire camp, the only rule I'm going to stress for them is for them not to be an ahole.. respect an existing camp and be civil.  If he wishes even help out the existing camp... and when that camp is done, be fair and reasonable when determining who is up next... that doesn't mean they have to get at the end of an 8+ long line of clerics most of whom are likely to not even be there at the time of the current Ragefire going down.  They could choose to do that, but if they don't that doesn't make them the bad guys.  It also doesn't mean demand to be next and berate what you guys are doing... both sides need to be civil and understanding of each other..  a guild that has no need of a buddy system to camp ragefire is not obligated to defer to one... and a collection of guilds working together in an organized fasion is certainly something to be given due respect... <br>
<br>
My own opinion is if the waiting list isn't too severe, it's an advantage even for a top end guild to use the list... it takes a lot of the burden off of the guild, who is usually kept plenty busy with this raid or that.. and lets the cleric raid with the guild while he has a spot secure.  <br>

I was pissed when I posted.  All I'm sayin is that a bunch of clerics banded together and are working together to get their epics.  Then someone posts here and people start posting negative stuff about it.<br>
<br>
We all know the rules... and we also know how meaningless they are.  Verant doesnt respect camps?  Hmmmm... I seem to recall that the GMs have forced a rotation in NToV.  Sounds like a camp to me... AND one that's not only GM supported... but GM enforced.<br>
<br>
Point is that some clerics are working together, and they are not being Elitist... they're just being nice to each other.  For once, it'd be nice to support these clerics... rather than put them down, and criticize 'em.  <br>
<br>
People complain about the &quot;horrors&quot; of the reservation systems.  Sorry folks... not the same... not by a long shot.  The Planes Reservation System crashed because the people running it couldnt/wouldnt take into account the uber guilds who only wanted Inny/CT.  There was also the talk of favortism.  Well... so far I wont comment on favortism... cause I havent seen any.  The Uber problem isnt a problem, cause it's only for a single mob... nothing more.  And as far as the wait goes, people are gonna have to wait anyway... so you might as well wait in line and play nice.<br>
<br>
And yeah... I know that there are those who dont care or agree.  But to those folks, STFU.  Keep your negativity to yourselves, cause you're tainting a good thing. <p><center>
