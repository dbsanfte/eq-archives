Blal and Kaastle are cool, Kaas was in MC with me a while back...<br>
<br>
Anyway...<br>
<br>
Imagine if say, VM cleared ALL of PoF, and then my guild (RIP) comes in and demands that we roll on Cazic Thule. <br>
What do you think they would say to us? Seriously? Honestly? A GM would laugh at us if we told them to make VM roll against us for the killing rights.<br>
<br>
(Of course, we wouldn't do that. If some guild OBVIOUSLY goes through ALOT of trouble just to kill ONE mob, then we're going to respect it and leave them to it, until they either kill it or give up and leave.)  <br>

P.S. That was just an example and my own views, they don't reflect my guild's views, um, except about the not asking to roll thing, um, you know what I mean, sigh, I just made my post too complicated. NM! <p><center><img src="http://www.relinpor.com/sigs/zeiksig.jpg">

NOT. i'd call them the opposite. as rypem has mentioned earlier before this ADD and AoA have had a few run ins that made ADD look terribly bad and still do in our eyes.<br>
<br>
first was their constant door openning in HoT (i wasn't there so i can't expand on this).<br>
<br>
next yael was up in the hole and ADD thought they're be awesome and get to him before us. we had the majority in the zone but it seemed like a race. our leaders tried to talk things out with them for maybe some cooperation but they shruged it off and continued to their doom! yes their doom. they beat us to yael but totally wiped with a huge force! i was laughing my ass off, suited them right. well we went down and whooped yael w/ like 2 deaths from DTs or so. then we were kind and ressed their whole fallen raid so they wouldn't have to spend hours on a lvl 1 rogue doing a CR. ya ADD that's right, maybe that should teach you some hospitality leasons, cause damn you need them.<br>
<br>
so our most recent adventure with ADD was severlious. we have 8 in zone before they even get one. we have about 15 in zone when they have 5. we tell them in /ooc that we have sufficient force and we're taking sever, but of course it lands on deft hears, those pricks. so we have about 21 now or so and we tell them we're pulling sev in 5 minutes and to plz respect our presence and our pull. well about 4 minutes 30 seconds we catch this puller of theirs go right by ours and snagged sev to the druid port in, yes they were that eager to KS us. so we keep our mouths relatively shut and shrug this off, thinking they're totally moronic but oh well, so is the way of the game.<br>
<br>
now this @#%$ that ADD has pulled surfaces, and now my total opinion of them is :<br>
<br>
ADD is the gathering of the worst personalities and the shittiest people on the server.<br>
<br>
if you're not like these people and you're in their guild, i suggest you find more honorable people instead of these stealers who give you a bad name and cause people like me to call you shitty even though some of you might not be. any guild would be better then /w all son of a bitch. so to those that i've yet to meet and have nothing to do with ADD's terrible way of conduct i say sorry and encourage you to seek better things =)<br>
<br>
<br>
thought i'd share this since this thread is over what big idiots people from ADD are . have a good day! &lt;grins&gt;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uqutsemnie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/13/02 2:29:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=179>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ADD = @#%$ domain defilers</span><hr size=1> verbo you give us a hard time about being unresonable, but your account of the pull is clearly a lie to everyone that reads this thread.  even your most argent supporter didnt use your version.  Its that clear that what your saying with whats going on isnt possible.  your credibility is out the door.  <br>
you followed radiant into fear<br>
you followed radiant into the temple<br>
you out agrod bippity<br>

Calling bippity a liar was the most foolish thing you could have done.  but it suits your character.  the consequence of that may even be worse then what you did to radiant. she is well known. well liked. and well thought of.<br>

<br>
1.  None of this talk about who aggroed the Shissir first is worth the effort to debate.  ADD should not have been in the damn zone, trying to take the mob in the first place.<br>
<br>
2.  If this level 60 *UBER* Monk with the L33T pulling skills thinks he can waltz into the temple in fear, eating 10-15 HT's from the Amy's, and then walk out with the Shissir solo, then I want some of whatever he is smoking, it is some great sh1t.<br>
<br>
3.  If indeed Verbo pulled it first, then he must be the absolutely worst level 60 monk on the server.  According to Bippity's logs, she was able to pull aggro off of him by swinging, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   AND MISSING </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> just <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   ONCE </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  <br>
<br>
4.  If, Verbo did indeed engage the Shissir first, then successfully FD, then I will concede that this would allow Bippity to run up to the mob, swing at it, and gain aggro.  However, if this is the case, Bippity should have seen Verbo's FD'd carcass near the mob, and she did not.  Regardless of who got aggro on the Shissir first......please refer to point #1.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have said it before, and I will say it again.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD DO IT.  IF YOU THINK THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING, JUST MIGHT BE WRONG, CHANCES ARE THAT IT IS WRONG. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
Im sorry to see noone even bothers to read my and tristadorns post which are the only ones of any relevance in the entire matter. Noone else had the info that we had and we were the ones issuing the orders so how can anyone elses post be of any relevance. Even Bippys ... i respect Bippy a lot and know her to be up and up person and i got nothing bad to say about her. Everyone seems to go like *absurd example out of court* (judge asks &gt; was the other guy first in the shop ... the Accused&gt; Yeh he was first in but only because he shot me in the leg from behind while i was in front of him otw to the shop ... the judge &gt; doesnt matter he was in the shop 1st you are found guilty as charged). I dont think i need to further explain anything other than what i did write in my post im sure ull agree its a very theral description lol even my own guildies told me its time consuming to read that book of a post.<br>
<br>
Id just like to adress that accusation about yael. It seems you are totally misinformed about that lol (as is most ppl that ever post here). That raid of yours was for a paladin whose name now escapes me to complete his Strength of Elements quest. The add raid was also for a paladin for the sme quest. You did not arrive first nor did we ... we both basically shown up in force at about the same time. At the early point neither of us was even aware that someone is shooting for yael so we both had 2 groups each in zone before we even started thinking hey those other guys might be here for yael too. I talked to that paladin who was leading your raid and proposed a rolloff as i always do. He said he has been waiting for yael to pop for months and wouldnt like to lose it on a roll. So we both agreed lets make it competitive and well just race to the mob. The agreement was reached in friendly and sportsmanlike spirits .. personally i thought we didnt have a chance of beating you to him since u were about to coth ppl almost directly to Yael ... if u had a mage camped in safe spot i dont know ... maybe just dragged him there and stick rezed im. Anyway he wished me good luck on breakin and i wished him good luck no the cothing. My force proceeded to fight our way down in what i can only describe as lightspeed since we arrived at yael before you guys were cothed. We hastily decide to pull and got wiped due to everyone being next to 0 mana from the breakin. Quite naturally in the spirit of the race you got in then and proceeded to kill the mob ... it was a fair and sqare race and you won it. I was the first to congratulate your raid and the paladin personally on the quest and kill and we chated for almost half an hour later discussing paladin class, inspected eachother equip and talked about how sad that yael is such a long pop. We did all this in good spirits .. my raid was aware of the race being a friendly competition and we all congratulated you on your kill. What caused you to beleive we were there trying to run over you is absolutely beyond me so please dont even start making accusations over thing u obviously have no idea of. Also please dont mock add ... our alleged huge force was an astounding AoW killing size of 13 people which was roughly the same as your force i would say. I never mocked anyone and much less gloated over someone elses failure and i do not deserve mockery and misstatements from anyone.<br>
<br>
Also even though i asked to be contacted in tells over the matter at hand Radiant did not do this. I made it a point of being online for 18 hours straight to give ample opportunity to do so. I am quite prepared to do something to redeem any wrongs and hurts real or imagined done to anyone by me but i suspect other party doesnt want any of that and will rather pout in the corner somwhere and for the next 6 months try to convince people that add is bad rather than accept what i would offer so we both could salvage some dignity rather than just close off to eachother and hail ourselves with gunshots. As it is in human society bad is always beleived before good so i fully suspect i managed to tarnish my name here no matter the GM ruling or my personal reputation in the past. So i guess i must live with it ... next time i should be less naive and not beleive anyone would even consider the flamed partys standpoint objectively.<br>
<br>
With that the matter is closed to me! Still awaiting in game contacts.<br>
