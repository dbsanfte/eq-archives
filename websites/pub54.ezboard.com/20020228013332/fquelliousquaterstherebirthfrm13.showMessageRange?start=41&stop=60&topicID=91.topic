It would not enter my mind to attack a mob that has been agroed by someone else. <br>
<br>
On the other hand if that person died, i would attack the mob!<br>
<br>
But if I run up to a mob and its feared, doted, nuked and a pc is sitting next to it, I would tend to think he was on the mob.<br>
<br>
Reminds me of a time that me and my rl son (age 11) were playing lev 10 guys in Wc and we attacked a Kodiak. After a bit I noticed someone had charmed it, and I asked him why he did it? Since we were attacking it. His response was &quot;cause I wanted to&quot;…  <br>

Wow, that's some real dedication to your believe that you were right torros. You could take talking about it for all of 15 minutes before quitting the guild? If you believe that what you did was SO right, then you should have stayed and proven your point. The simple fact was that you were wrong and your ONLY problem seems to be that people can't just &quot;get on with your lives...&quot; as you so aptly put it. <br>
<br>
Let's look at it this way, how about if YOU had of been on your druid. YOU had engaged the mob first and were waiting for say a guildy to port in and help kill it. Then let's say that Tynan had of walked up attacked and killed it, what would you call that? Oh wait.... that's right.... it seems as if it's only ksing when they do it to you, but it's your RIGHT to get the map because you were camping it before, right? Bull @#%$.<br>
<br>
torros sorry but 'i was camping it before' and then KSING IT from someone else who was camping it and had already ENGAGED the mob is not a valid reason to KS. No matter WHAT you say, you can't deny that he had already engaged it and he DID NOT ASK for help. That is kill stealing plain and simple.<br>
<br>
You were the one that blew up at me, YOU were the one that dragged your dirty laundry out into our guildchat then put me on ignore. I didn't really know you that well so at the very least, being my guildmate, i was going to give you the chance to explain yourself. It seems you showed your true colors by basically saying that you were &quot;owed&quot; the map i guess cuz you camped it? Hell I've been in hate on and off since march trying to get my hate stone, you don't see me up there ninja looting hate stones do you? but /gasp i'm &quot;owed&quot; that right? the eq community should bow down and yield up a stone? /sarcasm off. what a @#%$ crock. grow up and realize the world DOESN'T revolve around you.<br>
<br>
You're just pissed because you ks'd something and got caught, it's no one's fault but your own. Convenient that you just quit the guild to avoid having any judgment against you made. I guess that that map piece isn't seeming as important now is it? Sorry you see all this as a &quot;hate&quot; campaign. I see it as justice being done. I don't even really know you that well so how could i &quot;hate&quot; you?<br>
<br>
And as for people slamming HoH for this, that's a bunch of crap. I know that I and all of my guildmates I have known or spoken to about this do not condone KSing. <br>

While this is not really a moderated section in that i wont delete or edit stuff one thing that will NOT be tolerated is the use a severly foul language in any form. <br>
<br>
You can flame w/o using such language in fact, cursing like that detracts from any point your post was trying to make. There is however a line that is never to be crossed.<br>
<br>
I will NOT tolerate racial slurs of any kind. If i see anyone use the 'N word' in either a descriptive or dimunitive way, I WILL BAN YOU FROM THE BOARDS. I hope im clear on this. The person responsible knows who he is, and while i do like having him post here and really enjoy reading some of his stuff, i just wont tolerate that. I should clarify though that he did not in any way direct it as an insult. He was attempting to drive home a point without being insulting.<br>
<br>
Read what you type before you hit add reply from now on. You can flame on and make ANY argument w/o resorting to slurs and/or graphic cursing. If you cant write something w/o using racial slurs or graphic cursing, you really shouldnt be writing anything at all.<br>

<br>
Ties or no ties, if he/she was there at the mob before you then you do not have the right to kill it, even if you came to help.<br>
How long you have been trying to kill a mob means nothing.<br>
A warrior is supposed to back off from an engaged mob just like every other class.<br>
Whether the person who claimed the mob is in zone or not does not matter. The only thing that does is the fact that there was another character who engaged the mob and was  not asking for your help.<br>

Secondly, in that near two months I haven’t had much if any contact with Torros and up to this post, in all honesty, I still have not.  We’ve just been busy with our own things I guess.  This past week I’ve been getting the urge to play, so I started cruising my message boards more liberally than I had been for the past month and a half save for Monkly-Business of course<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  I don’t come here except maybe once every week or so and (as you can probably see) I’m really nothing more than a lurker.  I came to this forum today and to my surprise I saw a familiar name.  My first response upon seeing the title was that Torros was the one that got KS.  Soon though, I saw what the real problem was.<br>
<br>
Some history: Torros is the one that got me into thisgame.  He’s always been a good friend since the day I met him (about 6 years ago).  For the record, I don’t like the flame boards.  Any flame boards.  I clicked here by accident in the scroll.  I don’t think it’s fare because it’s a lot easier for someone to make a post about something someone’s done which said person views as  bad, than it is for someone to post all the good things they’ve done in their time.<br>
<br>
By no means do I condone or condemn Torros’s actions.  I wasn’t there, I haven’t been playing, and all I have to judge of what happened is this post.  I haven’t spoken to him or my guild (if you guys even remember me<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) about any of this.  I may get flamed for this post, I may ruin my own reputation in some of your eyes for sticking up for such a “l33t dewd(TM)” in your opinion, but he’s my friend and I won’t just sit here while he’s belittled and insulted for one action that took place in his two years and some odd months of playing (and no, that’s not an embellishment) which you seem to think is unforgivable.  I’m also the one who got Torros into the guild, and if HoH wants to remove me, as someone who posted here seems to think they should, then I’ll accept that.  I’d miss a lot of you as guildmates, but if you feel it’s necessary, then so be it.<br>
<br>
Now let me see if I can post two examples of how one could interpret this incident.  First, I’ll post it pro Leylani.  Obviously, Tynan, you were there attacking Stormfeather.  You were on the mob first, it was your kill and regardless for the reason, a KS is a KS and Torros KS.  Now, pro Torros.  Torros comes to a spawn that he’s apparently been after for a long time now.  He hears someone /ooc they are on the mob but when he reaches said mob he sees not only that the person who supposedly “had” the mob is gone, but some unknown Druid attacking it now.  For all he knows this Druid is  attacking said mob just because it has a strange name above its head.  Perhaps she’ll just loot the item he’s been after and destroy it because she doesn’t know what it’s for.  I’ve destroyed plenty of No Drop stuff myself because I figure it’s for some quest I’ll never do and it’ll just end up taking up bank space.  Now, by no  means am I taking one side or the other.  I’m just trying to show that there are always certain points of view one can take in instances such as this.<br>
<br>
I felt the need to post this because Torros <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a good guy.  One (what most people replying to this post seem to view it as) “jerk” move shouldn’t define a whole person’s career in this game.  He’s done countless things to help myself and others in this game but I guess it only takes one “childish move” for someone to be blacklisted.  Judge me how you will, but I will stick up for my friend.<br>
