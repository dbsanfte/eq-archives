Stylee I consider you a friend and if this is the real you still I still do. The return policy was designed for upgrades for other members. Seeing how Stylee was already in Cobalt he was seriously in line for the next ToV BP that dropped. We ALL do turn ins of droppable stuff to pass down. That has been known since day one of the guild creation and NO ONE ever has an issue with it until they think they can do better. Stylee was a great warrior and he will be missed but this act of childish malice is just rediculous. He has been given all the time he wanted to post his case on our internal boards then decided to move it to the public instead of working out a personal conflict with HH. And for you slamming her /rude. You don't know the first thing about her or how she plays. I have been in AE groups, raids and just about every other situation and she keeps a damn wizard alive of all people. <br>
<br>
I hope you can work out your issues with her Stylee, but if not oh well. Don't go slamming an organization that went to bat for you when you pissed off over 2/3 of the people you talk to with your big mouth (yes you know you spout off a lot so don't even try to defend that one, was one of the reasons I like you). It is not so much that the guild demands things that are given out on raids, it is the fact we are an up and coming guild that wants EVERYONE to be equipped as well as we can get them. So it is a big deal when a 60war quits and the 58s could really use that Cobby BP until we get more Kael ones. Oh well, to each their own but have respect for the rest of us man. <p><b>

From your comments I'd assume you meant you turn something droppable in when you get something that is better.... so what did Stylee get that was better that would cause him to turn in the cobalt bp?  And how is it so much different to skip Stylee in the order for kael bp and go on to the level 58 that would be getting it?  The logic seems to escape me... <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46578"> Salta </a>

Also Zupe, I think what Salta meant is that, now that I'm gone, more ToV armor will go to your &quot;58s &quot; than would if I were still there.  No one is getting cheated out of armor.<br>
<br>
It's simply another issue of Fifth Eclipse worrying way too much about their loot, and way too little about effectively acquiring more.<br>

The most amusing part is this....  First Zupe says &quot;We turn in droppable items when we get something better so another guildie can have.&quot;  Now he says &quot;We turn in droppable items when we get something better OR when we quit.&quot;<br>

<br>
While I would not accept such a forced practice (I try to hand down items anyway), rules are rules... and if this is the way of 5th Eclipse, then hey.. more power to em.  If it was well documented, then the BP (if gained while in the guild) should have been returned.<br>
<br>
It would be the honorable course of action (though why someone would join a guild with those rules is beyond me)  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As far as HH goes, I lived with her a while when her, me (as Huzya), flyingpig, syllie, uggmugg, etc went through our 40s in CoM.  She's always struck me as a wonderful person, and a capable healer.  <br>

Quas, where did you see it? I looked at each post.<br>
<br>
If this unwritten rule was adopted after Stylee joined and he remained in the guild (by remaining any reasonable person would assume he's all right with loot rules), then it's his/her bad.

I have never seen a more  immature and childish act then this one by Styee. Grow up. Why do you bring internal guilds things into public places? I'm going to go out on a short short limb here and say it was STRICTLY for embarressment sake.  Yes its a KNOWN GUILD RULE that when you leave the guild, you give things that the GUILD earned back to the family. Sorry Stylee but you alone didnt kill Trak. It's not just your BP. But perhaps if you had shown some adherence to the rules, you could have kept it. When i left 5e briefly, i offered all my gear back that i had been awarded during my time there. But Ghenghis  showed their appreiaction..as im sure they would have to you..by letting me keep the gear. But whatever, you kept the BP. I honestly didnt give a rats ass until i read how you aired dirty laundry out on a public server. You dont like Holyheal, she doesnt like you. Grow some balls and stop crying for mama Quellious when you run into a problem. <br>
<br>

The situation is over. It was over when the BP was given away. So blah blah blah lets all get over it.<br>

Now if every warrior in guild has colbalt bp or better, then hell be my guest, but that is not the case, to better the guild this rule was invented. If you have a problem with this rule dont join the guild. I remember explaining this exact same rule right before loot was given out on that trak raid because that was one of the first trak kills we had as a guild, obviously stylee did not have a problem then. Now I have never harrassed Stylee, nor will i ever do so, its his own choice to leave honorably or not. Now with holyheal harrassing stylee? All she did was ask for the bp bak, which is her job as guild leader to do so, she used a very direct approach. It really disturbs me that you guys can judge and flame someone just like that.  <br>
.........................................................<br>
salta dont be talking about stuff that u dont know about, cuss u werent even in solb. Holyheal camps ragefire, my guild cleared fgs twice for her, 20hrs later, lc monk openhand (thats right a monk camping ragefire)  shows up saying he was camping it but went ld for 24 hrs. So we try to talk to him reasonably, but no he says lc will get more people here faster then 5e, and its his camp, so gm was called and we were foced to roll and the monk won the roll and we left. Now next week hh camps it again, we clear fgs again, 2 lc clerics came up with us when we were the ones clearing fg, and claims camp and refuse to roll for camp. Then they made an agreement that all three would all stay at the camp the whole time and camp ragefire till it pops, and then help the others with their ragefire, thats honorable and fine, but 2 hrs later, both lc clerics camp, they came bak in 13 hrs, one of them agrees that camp belongs to us, and left, the other lc cleric didnt not leave and still claims camp, so after 2 hrs, lc cleric camps again, comes bak in 12hrs, claims camp still, died 3 times, all three times asking me to drag his corpse, this time lc and 5e cleared fgs together then u have lc cleric garrick running his mouth off being his normal charming self, but thats another story, after fgs claered sure enough he camps again, after another 10 hrs or so, the ragefire npc spawns around 8 am in the morning same time when the lc cleric poped after his sleep, well my guild got there, got some friends from other guilds, while lc got one war there, so we killed ragefire fair and square, now u calling us stealing ur ragefire camp? give me a break, through out this whole incident hh has been in solb, only when she is killed by fg she was away from the camp, can u say the same for ur clerics? And how do I know this? because I was there for 20+ hrs during those days, and was there for all those fg clearings. Now i'm not flaming Lc, i respect alot of the guys that i've grouped with and known, otherwise i'd have posted this a long time ago.<br>

As for stylee refusing to return the BP, i'd say that thats a lil on the selfish side, cuz im sure that there are many other warriors in 5E that would love to own the BP. What was said is true, u didnt kill Trak alone..the guild killed it..and im sure that there were many warriors wanting the BP too that day. How would they feel when they realise that u've &quot;retired&quot; and given the BP awya to ur close friend. Think abt it bro, and all HH did was merely ask for the BP back, so that other warriors might be able to use it. Its all in the rules.<br>
