<br>
Ever wonder what devotes a scammer to do what he does? Be it an account or some petty item scam in EC. Some say its the greed. While others say its the matureity factor of the acne faced 13 year old behind that computer desk. Few know the real reasons why they do what they do. The reason they do it is pure and honorable. The sole purpose for any cona rtist/scammer is for the challenge. It seems it is also the same in this fake reality we call EverQuest.<br>
From the begining of time there have been the bad apples of the bunch. The outkast that no one wants around. The ugly duckling everyone pokes fun off. This my friend is your typical Everquest scammer. They have stabed so many people in the back they have forced themselfs into a dark corner. While in this dark corner there is no one but themselves. They are revolted by normal patrons of the game. Even the &quot;noobies&quot; despise the dispicabel scum we call scammers.<br>
When someone looses htheir account or items from their account they usually instantly go around advertiseing they hav ebeen hacked. 99 out of 100 of the times this happens it is from scamming and not hacking. <br>
Shall I define scamming for you? The art of scaming is the process in which you manipulate or use what we like to call social engineering to get something that you want. Be it for the greed or for the challenge.<br>
Ah the great art of social engineering. The term &quot;if theres a will, theres a way&quot; best suites the term social engineering. This simply is just geting other people to do your work for you. With just mere words you can bend a person into beliveing anything. With just a few solemn words you can make them do your every bidding. Is this a skill that can be learned? Sadly no. You either got it or you don't. I will go over a classic exampl of social engineering that I have seen work time and time agian.<br>
I call this the &quot;Ladder Branch&quot; technique. It is where you obtain the account information to one account and use that account to branch out and get others. Example. You have been in a guild for a litle over a month. You start to gain alot of the members trust and loyalty. So you scamper over to one of your new friends and ask them to share accounts with you. Ofcourse them being niave like most of the Everquest community is they will GLADY just hand you the info to their account over. Sound to easy? Try it and be amazed of the stupidty. Once you have acess to the account log onto it ASAP. This part may take a bit of research but it will be worth it for extra loot. First you need to find out the persons &quot;best bud&quot; in game. Soon as you have done so then you send them a tell once you are loged on to the account you already have gotten, and ask them if they would let you use their account for a bit. Some common things I find work alot are &quot; Hey I've never played xxxxclass before, mind if I try your xxxclass?&quot;. Or &quot; Hey I need your xxxclass to help me with xxxthing, mind if I use him sometime?&quot;. Sounds stupid ya? Well be amzed when this litle trick works. Wow so far you have two account? All you had to do is..type a few sentances and log onto Everquest a few times? Not bad so far? Now just keep branching out those account from the friends of the accounts you get. You can get DOZENS of accounts like this if you learn to master this technique and practice your reasons for useing the targets account.<br>
Next ace in the hole we will talk about will be the ever popular phone call scam. It is when you call up targetX and simply parade yourself off as someone else in order to get their info. You might be thinking..people are to smart for that, well think agian. Here is a nice example I once used. Sorry for the use of te names, but heh lessons need to be taught right? this example is a true account of what happened. All names are true.<br>
Well me and my friend Greg Knight decide to team up on this upcomeing project he has approached me with. We somehow caught wind of some precious Lotus Cult members section information on their messageboards( Thanks Jesibelle!). Well looky here they just happen to have a list of half the guilds real life names an phone #s. Now that we had the tools it was time to go to work. So pick a few names out of the list. Colach and Arreanors named poped out of the list of many. Jesibelle also gave us some information to her ex-lover, Wyen. Such as his real life name,age,parents etc etc. So I tihnk to myself a bit and planed it out. Then we were ready to execute the plan. So we give Colach a ring. He answers and I parade my self to be Josh (Wyen, an officer of the Lotus Cult). Being 14 years of age the younge colach eaisly bought into my social engineering dialouge that went something like this. &quot; Hey bud its Josh here, you know me as wyen on everquest. Well to get to the point, I need a good monks account info handy just incase something is up and we need a puller for it, and we voted on you for the monk for the job.&quot;<br>
Let me point out a few things. When I siad &quot;we voted on you&quot; That just flatters him and helps him buy the scam that much more. We chose to target Colach for the sheer purpose of his age. Well it didin't take much for the litle bud to hand over his account info.<br>
Then we moved on to the ever popular Everquest player Arreanor AKA- Carlos from Texas. This one was just that much easier. I call im up and simply tell him we are collecting Lotus Cult members account info for &quot;just in case&quot; emergencys. Sure enough he hands it over. One heart one love right Carlos?<br>
Sounds to easy right? Well right you are it is that EASY. It surprises even me how niave people are of all ages.<br>
I get alot of questions about such things as &quot; How do you jakc the items of an account and still keep them? Won't the GMs just take them.&quot;<br>
Well my answer to that is &quot;not if you do it the right way&quot;.<br>
The right way was not ane asy thing for me to find. Three accounts banned and a few friends down the hole. Eventully I found the way. Just becuase I could careless I will gladly share it with you all! Youw ill need a total of three accounts to pull this off. The account your jacking and two dummy accounts with a few small items on them each. First you use dummy account1 to auction WTS item01. Then you send dummy account1 a tell from the account your jacking saying &quot;Hey I'll trade you all these uberitems01 for that item01.&quot; Then simply reply with a simple yes on the dummy account1. Then do the transfer. Then rinse and repeat with the other dummy account to the other dummy account. This way they GMs will be forced to rollback the account that was jacked and can not take the uber items 01 away from dummyaccount02 simply becuase it was alla legit trade. They have no basis to take items away from people who traded for tem &quot;honestly&quot;.<br>

It named a few names, Salival, Opiatis, Bumedan etc. Well I logged on to see Opiatis in front of me.  I asked him if he was involved. He said no, but he knew Salival, and he has made over 3000$ scamming eq accounts. He said something about him and salival being neighbors, both living in California. I may have been fed a load of @#%$, if so; he's extremely good at acting. He also said something about Salival jacking 4 or 5 Wraith accounts, posting about it to brag, as seen here, and someone tracked the IP and called his house. They apparently made some death threats, etc. He ended up giving them back. Opiatis came right out and told me all of this surprisingly and it all seemed real. Well hope someone can piece two and two better than me. But it seemed as if he said something of a Casey and a Greg, he didn’t use last names. <br>

If mine or Jesibelles name are mentioned on the boards, on the phone, or on the friggin Tonight Show by you or anyone you associate with, I press charges against you for every one of the many laws you've broken. I don't care if you want to praise our names for being the stand-up people we are, if ONE more silly hacker refers to either of those names, I'll see you in court.

<br>
Ive got a bit of law background, but i cant think of a tort that this would fall under...<br>
<br>
Not saying you dont have a reason to be mad, hell i would be livid, im just saying i don't think anything he has done would be considered breaking the law...&quot;stealing&quot; eq items is not considered theft of property, theft of information maybe, but that would be sony's claim not yours.  He never really &quot;stole&quot; any accounts, most accounts were readily given to him.  He never hacked anyone.  Maybe slander if what he said about you guys is not true, but even then, he talks about Wyen and Jesibelle, not the &quot;real&quot; you.   I honestly don't think the government could do anything about this...only one here who could do anything is sony corp.  i &quot;think&quot;<br>
<br>
If you guys know different please let me know, im honestly curious.  Im not sticking up for this scum by any means...It is moraly disgusting to see someone take advantage of so many people's trust.  Im hoping that you guys will NOT give your information to ANYONE!.  Who knows if your bestfriends friends friend isnt at Joe's house and well...you see what i mean..who knows who is actually playing the character...it could be Greg or Casey....or any of there other friends...<br>

I was thinkin' the same thing; however, if Wy's referrin' to the use of his and Jesi's name in a defaming manner, couldn't a libel suit be filed?  (Not a lawyer, so not sure of the requirements for libel.  /shrug)<br>

<br>
We have extensive evidence of Casey croft and Greg knight.<br>
Casey lives in blue ridge, GA. and Greg lives in Parker, CO.<br>
<br>
However. we also have people saying that the players Salival, and Bumedan are neighbors (2 separate posters mentioned this), and 1 post saying they live in CA.<br>
<br>
So which is true? If Salival is Greg, and lives in CO. how can he be neighbors with Bumedan/sendole/khatup aka Casey who lives in GA?<br>
<br>
All the info still doesnt add up.. although i dont doubt it that some if not all of the info is corrupted. Its just filtering out the crap from the truth that managed to slip through.<br>
