<br>
Obsedianx ,a necro,  wanted to join my guild, Voice of Rallos, on our plane of air raid.  At the start while we was waiting to port up, she was going on and on about how excited she was to be raiding and looked forward to fighting alongside our own Necro.  <br>
<br>
VoR paid for the port up stones, all the coffins that was used, and peridots for the clerics.  We port up, rock the first island and those that didn't get to loot a piece for a key, which she was one of them, had a key bought for them by VoR.  We then go to the island where the Azracks (spelling is off probably) and since most of us didn't know what to expect being our first time, we got jacked up and had a whipe out.  <br>
<br>
We all met back in Nro and proceeded to port back up and get our corpses summoned.  She gets in our port wizards face telling him she has a real life emergency.  When he didn't drop someone and take her, she proceeds to tell him, in tells &quot;hello!!&quot;  &quot;you know what RL is?&quot;  Next trip he goes ahead and takes her up.  She then gets in our necro's face and wont leave him alone until he summons her corpse.  She then pesters the cleric for a rez.  Remember, RL emergency here and she is taking time to bother these people so she doesn't lose xp.  Cleric resses her.  She jumps off the island, gates to Nro, runs to ec and basically stays in ec for the rest of the day.  One of our warriors who wouldn't be able to make the whole raid confirmed that and that she was auctioning items.  (not saying auctioning stuff from Air because we didn't get far enough to get anything good yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )  One of my officers did contact her and she said her dishwasher blew up.  That was the emergency.  When another of my officers talked to her and asked why she didn't log, she said because she took care of it already.  When he asked her that, the last group for corpse summoning was being ported up.  She could have stayed on the raid and just went afk if it was only a dishwasher problem.  <br>
<br>
Needless to say, two port stones, a coffin, time, and mana was wasted on Obsedianx just so she could change her mind and go play elsewhere.  <br>
<br>
Sorry about the novel but I wanted to try and explain things that happened.  I wanted to let other guilds know that if you are going to invite this person on a raid, you might want her to pay for the port stone or coffin or something first before she goes with you, because if it looks like it might be some effort, she wont stay.   <p><image src="http://www.btinternet.com/~killspring/drev6.jpg"></image></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sirina>Sirina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Super Monk</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/15/01 6:34:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A warning</span><hr size=1> Thats a sweet sig Drevis.<br>

Like someone said, she had SMR and high end stuff back during pre-kunark.<br>
<br>
I've never run into her on a group/raid/guild, but that's partly because of looking for alternative necros.<br>

We, being a friendly sort, said yes... much to our chagrin. Upon joining the raid, the first thing she said was 'My boyfriend's going down on me while I play', and the quality of her comments did NOT improve from there. It ended with her being thrown off the raid for talking smack to/not listening to the raid leader, and then having her train the ever-loving hell out of us, leading to a somewhat lengthy CR.<br>
<br>
As far as I know, she's the only person expressly forbidden from ever raiding with us again, ever.<br>
