<br>
2 things I'm gonna post. <br>
<br>
1) how the hell do you properly quote? I'll just address Gaethan's whole post, but someone please fill me in?<br>
<br>
2) addressing gaethan's post :<br>
<br>
The issue about me being a good guildleader - Thank you, but I'm not just like this for this small, however wonderful group of people. The 30-odd AC members aren't the only people that I act like this , in my time in revi, there were quite a few things i wanted, could have gotten, but didn't, due to the fact others wanted them and I knew that. Go check, I should have uhh .. 9.6 points , none spent ?<br>
<br>
It's called RVR. Time is spent to do certain things. I rate my RvR wherever I go. If I wanted a FUN zone, but NO exp, but to have a ball, i'd go and 2box in Greig's End. Sure, i'll piss myself laughing, but it isn't worth the time invested (but I still do go up there just to get some spiffy screenshots lol).<br>
<br>
It's also called advancement. My guild has no room for greed, Gaethan. Items are awarded by who *deserves* them the most. Sure, it may not be the best way to advance a guild (I should just equip the peeps who are the crucial classes! That way we can just do whatever we want .. no ... wait, sarcasm alert ;P ), but we are a guild of casual players, and as such, there isn't room for greed. You work hard, you get your just reward. Unlike a good 95% ++ of you all, I have faith in humanity, I know what I do is right, and if I fuck up, and I don't own up, I do apologize and move on. <br>
<br>
And then you get into your greater good, advancement as a whole may take longer, but allows us to be able to fall back on something in the event something happens in the future. (like more of our key, important players ebay.. that one hurt deep <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
However, I do agree, greed IS good at motivation. Doubt me?  Don't, you know it's true .. greed itself isn't good, but it sure is good to get the masses moving, is it not? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Honestly, you can look anywhere and see greed as a driving factor. <br>
<br>
and blal ..  No offense man, but I fail to see how you enter this conversation at all ? an objective opinion, perhaps, but IMO me and gaethan haven't started flinging flames like *ducks from the fire bombs Fkin is firing* these two are doing ... *jumps from Gaethan's barrage of fire*<br>

<br>
People use greed more generically when talking about want and desire or the likes.<br>
<br>
Greed is very subjective too.. Like  &quot;that person is so greedy!&quot; when in fact they aren't.  lets go back to Bill Gates for a bit. People say he is greedy right?  What would you do in his situation?<br>
<br>
I could go into a history lesson but I'd rather not.<br>
<br>
Does it really have anything to do with the word greed anyway?<br>
<br>
Its about the concepts of greed that I'm trying to show.  Fkin justs likes to take my posts out of context and use them against me.  people love to through around the word &quot;greedy&quot; on people who they are either &quot;jealous&quot; of or are trying to be the best they can be..<br>
<br>
There are few people in the world who are truly &quot;greedy&quot; Ones who will use, abuse and refuse people just for material posession.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fkin, Blal has a right to post whatever he wants and it has nothing to do with him being my guildmate anyway.. He is allowed to call me crazy or whatever he wants.. He just doesn't have a reason to.<br>
<br>
Remember its an opinion.  I don't hate Impudent for what he says or anyone else for that matter except you for attacking me unwarranted, twisting or taking my posts out of context for your personal gain or focusing on something i say when I'm angry and later clarify only to ignore that part..<br>
<br>
You are the idiot Fkin.. I'm just the reason of truth =)<br>
<br>
Why are you so fixated on the greed issue anyway? This is like the 3rd time you brought it up..<br>
<br>
Oh and Actuarian you are what a guildleader is suppose to be unless you are lying p<br>
<br>
Putting your guild first over yourself<br>

I dont blame you, I realize your stupid, and its clear most others in this forum do as well. I never said Blal didnt have the right to post here - far from it - I said that if he was going to defend you, he could at least say something of intrest. I am sorry your just that stupid and dont get it. Hell you still cant tell the differance between Greed and Need, why should I expect different? You never present anything of substance. When you do make a statement, its usually an outrageous absolute such as 'Clerics should <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>always</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> die first' or &quot;my guildmates <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>never</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> go out of their way to res me.' When questioned about your obvious idiocy you usually go off on some tangent that has nothing to do with the matter at hand, or outright contradict what you said, in the assumption that weight of print somehow makes people understand your simian point of view. I feel bad for you Gaelron I really do - not only are you a moron, but you actually believe your own press. Again please seek help you certainly need it. I also feel bad that Blal feels the need to defend you as a guildmate it must be painful for him.<br>

I do try.<br>
<br>
I will agree with some of gaethan's statments, and disagree with others.<br>
<br>
As a ranger, i end up soloing alot myself. I 2box because I enjoy it, I play little games, and see how many spiders I can do before I die, or how low hp I can get (i always lag right when I need it the most), etc, etc. He likes to quad wherever, take it up a notch, and keep it interesting.<br>
<br>
His way of exping is his own and many sware by it, my way varies but I'd rather quietly 2box in a corner in a empty velks then go join the giant clusterfuck that is PoP.<br>
<br>
( Hey, I could still get exp out of .. UD, LS, LD, wouldn't I, at 61? )<br>
<br>
Mind you , Gaethan seems to be like the many of us, rather tactless, he means what he says, but sometimes he doesn't say what he means. If you can't understand this, then you can't understand him, and thusly you cannot critize his way of thinking, because you have no clue.<br>
<br>
Fkin is a good guy, Gaethan is a pretty good guy as well. You two have your shit flinging wars, oh well, but gentlemen come to a serious medium.<br>
<br>
Let the man quad his mobs, Gaethan find a safer spot if possable, and keep a gate up? Hell I'll even refund your C3 costs if you loose it. Is that not a freaken happy medium?<br>
<br>
Now, if you ladies will excuse me, back to factoring trinomials .. must isolate k .. then factor it.. shoot me pls.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and btw if anyone knows mustaza punch him in the testicles, I want my money back and he wont cough it up ;(<br>

yes but it sucks not suck as in nerf suck as in my god why work so hard..<br>

one blue of 61 is a YELLOW of AA.  1 yellow of AA would get you 4% of 61 said another way.  it can be done old world but thats like doing 59 old style when they gave you a way to do 61 in a timely fashion.   <br>

PoP really aint a cluster fuck cept at the trials.<br>
<br>
the zone ins are a cluster fuck but those that hang out at zone ins while not in powerful groups arnt &quot;playing the game&quot; in the sense that they arnt playing smartly but rather standing around like stinking victims waiting for some inevitable action of a necessary train to finish them off.<br>
<br>
Let me say this if you really feel only stupid people train  *laugh*:<br>
Smart players dont let dumb players get them killed.  People doing the *same* stupid shit inevitably is a like a script of the game.  you wouldnt let a script kill you?  that wouldnt be smart.  Why let the same action kill you just cuase its player initiated?   <br>

Acturen, im standing up for my friend. I think its ok to do that from people that are not argueing with him, but just calling him stupid, etc. I call him gay, im pretty sure hes not, and he knows im not being serious. Fkin is insulting Gaethan for no reason. <br>
<br>
Simplifying Fkins posts can be done in one line :<br>
<br>
Gaethan, you're a moron and therefore you're wrong.<br>
<br>
Thats basically what hes saying. And i dont like it. If u insult people, u need backing. Fkin is just repeating himself with slightly different words. His arguement against gaethan is just calling him names, which is pretty fucking stupid.<br>
<br>
Peace out<br>

I could be wrong, but from what I understood, each AA point is pegged to level 51.  Thus, of course yer gonna get a lot more AA per kill at 61 than regular exp.  Perhaps this is why so many folks are rushin' to 65, then doin' AA....  after gettin' used to the exp grind of 59+, AA seems like cake (and is... how much exp could a 51 shammy get solo'ing WW dragons?)  <br>
