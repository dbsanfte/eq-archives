<br>
Burn raids and regular dargon raids have nothing in common, burn raid = 5 wizzies x1 nuke each for a total of 5 nuke = dead dragon.  Regular raids = getting the proper classes to even kill the dragon in question, getting proper buffs, resists, setting up a pull strat and battle strat, setting up a CHO order if needed, managing aggro, etc. So basically, Burn raid = no skill, regular raid = skill needed.<br>
<br>
And as far as all the 'hard work' needed to get MB in the first place, thats BS also, you can get enough AA for MB doing AE for one week, where as the it would take a hell of alot longer for any other non AE class. <br>
<br>
I think you seriously need to climb down off yer elitist high horse my friend.... I think the lil bit of power Verant gave you in MB has gone to your head....I mean c'mon, you threatened to follow that ninja gnome dude around for the rest of his EQ career and use your awesome MB powers to make his life hell by never letting him near Kunark dragons.

Blal, this sort of thing has been going on since EQ has been around.  Druids have been doing it forever cuz they can, now with MB, wizzies can do it, just on a grander scale.  6 of one, half dozen of the other, its all farming.  Just now, its the wizzies that are gonna have the best equiped twinks, instead of the dr00ds <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Reet Knight</span><br>  Posts: 550<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/18/02 2:13:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok - you've had your say on MB - what u think on this?</span><hr size=1> I have a hard time making an opinion on manaburn cause both sides make compelling arguements.. But I'm still gonna use it.  As Gemlin said I do it mainly for fun if I get loot I will use it to improve myself or others. I dont think this is an arguement either side can win. We just have to wait it out and see what happens.<br>
<br>
Montyy once again you overestimate AE. even with hardcore aeing No one could get the 24 aa or whatever it is in one week.. Well atleast I never did.. With AC ae nerfed.. and Sebilis ae sorta nerfed with the casters harder now.. The usual place people AE is FG and I have still yet to have a really good AE in FG. I say with a good amount of time spent you could get 7 AA or so and that would still be a month til manaburn.. <br>
<br>
Wizard AA is fast but its not like you snap your fingers and get a AA.. it still takes time. Also you forget the time it takes to get a wizard to 60. It took me a while.. So I am doubtful we will ever see manaburn twinks cause it took me about 80 days of time to get to 60 and manaburn. and thats too much to spend on a twink. <p><center>

<br>
Quas mentioned the same argument with killing Reavers in CoM - but their numbers are plentiful with a good repop time - and therefore not compariable with Kunark Dragons.  <br>
<br>
WW Wolves are exactly the same, plentiful.  <br>
<br>
Druids &amp; Rangers alike have tracked right from the beginning of EQ - it is common sense that they have this skill to kill a non-unique mob.<br>
<br>
They are simply EC Pumas in a different zone as a compariable<br>

Minor skill needed in comparison to regular grouping.  <br>
<br>
In a regular group, Wizards and Chanters are called upon to do lotsa things, all of which require timing, skill, and filling in where needed (Nukes, Snares, Evacs, Parking mobs, Kiting, etc).  Not the case in an AE group.<br>
<br>
In an AE group, only 2-3 people do anything.  1-2 Epic Wizzies pull (only skill here is to stay alive until you get to camp), and the cleric has to keep 5 low-HP classes alive during a ton of battle spam).<br>
<br>
Chanters basically turn themselves into Ogres and do nothing but chain-stun.  The non-epic wizzies just chain nuke.<br>
<br>
It's sad actually that while many can get to crazy AA levels through AE grouping, they sux at their class.<br>
<br>
Here's a great example....<br>
<br>
The other day, I was involved in a Chardok Royals raid.  We had 3 groups, all with a 60 Wizard in them.  One wizard didnt have her 59 AE, and the other group had a Wiz and a Mage.  We were AEing on pulls of about 5-6 at a time.  My team got no xp, and the first wizard team was getting maybe a few kills since she was with some great tanks.  The 3rd team (wiz/mage) was raping the kills.<br>
<br>
Well... we had a few mobs try to flee... so the raid leader asked that a Wizzie AE snare on the pulls.  Being the ranking wizard, I tell the wizard of the 3rd team to do it.  Why?<br>
<br>
1.  They just lost their cleric, so the snare would be less aggro than the chain-AE nuking.<br>
2.  It'll even out the xp amongst the other groups (yes, I know that raids arent about xp... but I still try to be as fair as possible).<br>
<br>
Know what the wizard told me?<br>
<br>
I cant, because I have no cleric.<br>
<br>
Say What?!?!?!  You cant?!?!?!?!<br>
<br>
Sorry... you just fekked up bad... in 2 major ways.<br>
<br>
1.  In the middle of a raid, you do what yer told, and do so without question (I had to actually argue with this foo before she STFU and started snaring).<br>
2.  You've just displayed that you cant even figure out how to snare a mob without getting aggro (a basic reguirement of most grouping wizzies... right up there with evacs).<br>
<br>
Yet this same wizzie sends me a tell last night saying that she's a Mistress now.<br>
<br>
Soon she'll have MB... and still be a crap wizzie.  One that will only be useful for slapping down a MB.  <br>
<br>
It's a waste of a player, a detriment to the class, and just a damn shame.<br>
<br>

Have you ever LOOKED at a track?!! there is a max of 1 on, their repop time is low due to being on the same spawn table as other things in WW.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, there are often about 4-6 on track at any time. They are as you say on a spawn table as other things in WW. This includes the elephants and rhinos, besides the wurms, worms, wyverns, and drakes. That means you can go on a killing spree of about 3 non-CoV faction animals (ie. Elephants, rhinos, and hounds) to get them to spawn. The spawn timer is only about 20-30 minutes for the common spawns in WW. <br>
<br>
As Garaddor stated, these 3 type of mobs are highest level mobs a level 60 ranger can solo for good XP. It is the only set of mobs after level 55 that a ranger can use fear animal against. Ranger hunt them for the XP just like other classes attack those raptors in Timonious Deep or AoE frogs in Seb or spend the time blasting spiders and dogs in Velks.<br>
<br>
I do find it funny those that we are trying to compare an approximately level 50 hound that many classes can solo to a level 63+ dragon that only 1 class in the game can take out with 6 or less people. But, you know you would be right if in your agrument if rangers and druids were the only class that could solo the hounds. It would be unfair to the other classes and should be changed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  How many classes can kill Gore with only 6 people or less of that class again?<br>

PS&gt; Remember, I am more for not nerfing manaburn because it would hurt the small guilds even more then stopping the abuse of a powerful skill. Any ways, I am not sure what you are upset about. None of the trackers on Quellious would be mean enough to deign you a chance to kill a hound. All the trackers are good people on Quellious and would never abuse their powers. Just ask them to get it for you and they will. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaeaanglastig.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaeaan Glastig</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/19/02 2:14:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=345.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.carolina.rr.com/dogsofwar/gaeaan2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok - you've had your say on MB - what u think on this?</span><hr size=1> I just spent 48 hours in WW getting my furs and armor done.  3/4 of the time I was trackerless.  The majority of the ppl in the zone while I was there...me, Paltas (thanks again for the help, holler if ya need me in there again to help ya out), Bakal (LOL, early mornin dragon whompins), and the occasional farmer.  And yup, know they're farmers cuz I'd keep auction channel goin to see who was rapin shawl questers for pelts, my ignore is so powah.  <br>
<br>
First off, in defense of Garrador(sp?)...about a month and a half ago I sat in WW for 9 hours on the scout camp (nobody knew when the captain had been killed last...booo).  Garrador and I sat there chattin for a while and when the scout popped, he called in a few friends to help me with the kill.  He also offered to help me with anything else in WW since that's where he does a lot of soloing.  Never saw him on during my fur camps, but I woulda been shameless enough to ask him for help if I woulda seen him in the zone.<br>
<br>
Second,  in my 48 hours I learned 2 spawn points for the hounds.  Hounds ALWAYS spawn at these 2 spots, with a 45 min respawn timer.  The 2 points are fairly close together and with the aggro radius of the hounds, I never had to worry about losing one to some farmer.  If any of you nontracker types are working on shawl 8 and need the furs, send me a tell in game sometime and I'll tell you how to get to the 2 spawns.  Fugg the farmers.<br>
<br>
And yes, keep killing mastidons, brontos, and wyverns.  It'll free up extra spawn points for the hounds.  Just be careful if you see 2-4 of em pathing really close together.  Killed 4 brontos last nite that were all walking close.  After they died my tracker friends start hootin and hollering that 4 hounds just spawned.  We go running to the closest one...all 4 had spawned right on top of each other...it weren't purty.<br>
<br>
Anywho, fugg the farmers, questers that can't track shoot me a tell for hound spawns. <p><Br><img src="http://www.student.nvcc.vccs.edu/home/tlazaroff/CR.jpg" border="0">

Wizzie: Hey Mr. Tracker, can you Track me a Hound so I can kill it for a pelt for a Quest?<br>
Tracker: Sure thing!  I'll go track and pull you a hound, so that you can kill it (get xp) and hopefully loot a pelt (1-2k value)<br>
<br>
Sorry... I think that somehow failed a Reality Check<br>
<br>
In Reality, the Trackers are only gonna give the pelts to friends and guildies, and sell the rest (which is well within their right to do) ... or they are there to get the pelts for their own run at the Shawl Quest.<br>
<br>
So somehow, I doubt you'll find a pick-up Tracker in WW to track hounds for you. <p><center>

&quot;I gotta say Blal.... I found this post extremely ironic since Garrador was selling them to one of my guildmates for 1k each. &quot;<br>
<br>
At that time Blal wasnt on his shawl quest that I know of. I just got done giving a good amount of furs to Banelion and Karraway, and your guildmate wanted those extra furs i had and was able to get while she was there also.<br>
<br>
So I turned a small profit to fund some &quot;dots&quot; for guild clerics on the next raid. As some folks stated, it was well within my rights to do so, even though I know I don't need permission to hunt the hounds for myself, for profit or even for a guildie.<br>
<br>
The subsequent helping of a guildie or turning a profit is the result of me trying to get experience, seeing that most AE groups really choose a war,pal or sk as their main tank anyways. You rarely see a AE manaburn wizard/chanter say hey, lets grab a ranger to be our tank to shield us. So you see I use WW to gain experience, help a guildie from time to time and also fulfill a role of supply and demand. <p>Garaddor Ghoulbane
