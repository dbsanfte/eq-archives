Well, IF it ever gets to random KS'ing Manaburn wizard bandit gangs being a problem, I think the best balanced fix would be the buff idea... make it so only 1 manaburn can land in say, a minute's time.. BUT... I'd also like to see Manaburn be instant.<br>
<br>
Be the last ditch &quot;oh @#%$ I overnuked and got summoned&quot; mana dump.  With a 6 second cast time it really is a toy and not that useful a tool if you are killing velious/sol level mobs.<br>
<br>
Course, if your crew tends to have more than 1 wizard over-aggro in a minute's time regularly, you might not like it so much. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Reet Knight</span><br>  Posts: 501<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/23/02 6:28:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=323.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This may touch some nerves, but WTF lets see what happen</span><hr size=1> thread is getting big.. where to start..<br>
<br>
I will start with AE.<br>
<br>
AE is not easy anymore.. with the nerf of Acrylia.. there are now less places to AE. In an average AE group.. I die around once and hour if not more. Even with 3 chanters in FG.. You are still risking the chance of a resist and getting flattened.  No AE doesnt require talent but since when do normal exp groups or EQ in general take skill?  AE is still more risk than I like and the exp isnt as sick as everyone says unless you are getting more than 50 mobs per pull... A normal group can clear just as well as a AE group in many instances. and AE in Luclin is generally a 58+ domain. <br>
<br>
Manaburn being a toy.. Don't say it is unless you have used it before.. A lot of wizards use the MB early and rod up technique for better aggro control.. A good wizard by the time you should be nuking will be like they never burned.<br>
<br>
I was gonna post a list of the non epic loot that the kunark dragons drop but that would be a waste of time.. Even smaller guilds who do Kunark dragons consider most of the dragon drops to be twink gear.. And since when is farming for twinks considered bad?  People need PP for twinks and I see nothing wrong with it.<br>
<br>
Montyy does that have anything to do with the fact you need a green scale still?  I have been thinking about trying to get that scale for you next time I burn something.<br>
<br>
I am very tired of seeing &quot;nerf manaburn&quot; threads everywhere by &quot;jealous&quot; people.. When I see wizards calling for a nerf then I will listen. <p><center>

The Gms will back you too if your buffing sufficient force.  An incident or two might happen; however, nobody will get away with a ks gang for long.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thats explicit KSn.<br>
<br>
Now i define something else.  There is a finite number of kunark dragons (as an example) that enter the game per a week.  By creating game mechanics such that far far less people of one class can do in these pieces of finite content you take away content from other people.  <br>
<br>
Also there is an implicit ks of sorts.  While i dont believe any wizards here would walk past anything that remotely looked like sufficient force i do believe it takes orders of time less to organize half as many people.  so while you can say the 30 of you can just go do what those 6 wizards do its much harder in practice.  So often you have situations i think where 30 other people dont realize how close they were to opportunity.<br>
<br>
all of this is painted over a landscape over a very finite set of content.  Ease of killing for one groups configuration literally causes inverse difficulty of killing via difficulty of finding up for another group.    <br>
<br>
I mean lets be honest.  mobs will always be down.  but an attempt by 25 people has 25 people experiencing game content for that week.  while an attempt by 6 people leaves 19 people still looking for content.  Now keep in mind some of use weenier types bring 50 people for these kunark content and the discrepency leaves 44 more people looking for a dose of eq content for that week.<br>
<br>
  further i dont see the original need.  What was it that wizards didnt have that made mana burn the best solution.  i submit whatever it was there was a better way.  the need itself could have been addressed.  <br>
<br>
My only solution that doesnt involve some insane rework is manaburn counters on a mob.  SO while the the manaburn would be instantaneous the counter on the mob would be persistant.  in this way you could limit the damage done onto a mob via manaburn by having a cap on the number of manaburn counters a mob could have at a time.  i would submit that only one is appropriate.  <br>
<br>
a nasty nerf?  like i said i dont get the need and ive listed the downside.  the downside isnt in the overall class balance its in the effect on game content flux densities.  (i just love fitting flux density into theoretical discussions i dont think it has much real meaning here =)<br>
<br>
And finally while mana burn does fit wizards into the guild picture (as if it wasnt already &quot;recipe: zerg or focus and bring lots'o'wizards for most things) as i believe it was intended the roving 6 wizards of 6 different guilds causes a complete new set of dynamics.   <br>
<br>
I strongly belive the success of EQ lies in the interesting and difficult need for guilds in the endgame.  anything that undermines that needs &quot;a nasty nerf&quot; as my objectors might put it.<br>

<br>
i object my friend =)<br>
<br>
the finite set of kunark dragons is sooo small.   <br>
<br>
ive never fought gore (59 rogue).  The counter argument isnt bout loot.  It doesnt matter to me if manaburn brings more epic pieces into the game. im happy for lauri. truly i am. if i had been there that day it would have been a trade i would have encouraged with cheers. HOWEVER. it is a trade.   What you gave up was content.  for some people they loose sight of the fact that attempting things and dieing is nearly as great as attempting things and getting phat lewts.  So much so that it is in some respects greater then getting lewts with no fight.  On that particular day you got what you came for but in reality you didnt get everything you came for.<br>
<br>
where i gain strength to reaffirm that i dont &quot;have my head up my ass&quot; is in the effect mana burn has on my game in the month to month sense. <br>
<br>
overall surely this is detrimental to the real role that guild abilities play in the &quot;play&quot; of the game.  As an example i saw a 52 kitty with warrior epic.  A clear twink. I remember thinking bout it because no guild i have been in could muster the ability to get the green dragon scale even for our most detirmined warrior.  It might be the single hardest epic mob to both find up and muster force for (you need VP keys)   However let me contrast that with the monk epic. a similiar guild could make butter of the monk epic mobs yet to this day i have had conversations along the lines of.<br>
how you doing on your epic?<br>
someday ill get it when we can do the PoA and Loio mobs.<br>
Those mobs are easy to find up and to kill.  <br>
hrmmm.<br>
<br>
Does that mean the guild that could do the monk epic easily is &quot;better&quot; then the guild that couldnt.  no not at all thats not fair.  many things apply. There are values beyond ability to melt content.  <br>
<br>
HOWEVER. there can be no doubt that the &quot;game&quot; in eq that provides challenge is largely driven by trying to move through that stratification.  to be the guild that can do the monk epic easily. to be the guild that can handle VP for twinks.  Doing that with or without your values intact doesnt change the medium that we are all playing through.<br>
<br>
THE GUILD IS THE GAME!  Now bring on something that in certain context can undermine the guild stratification while it seems like tasty candy in the short run it really takes away from the overall sophistication of whats going on in the game.<br>

<br>
1)  Anyone who farms any epic pieces to sell for personal profit is just an ass.  Don't care if it's a group of MB wizzies or a single power group, it's just plain fuggin wrong.  There are however a lot of MB wizzies who don't farm epic drops for personal gain.  I got the chance to hang with Blal and some of his MB friends on a VS manaburn.  Afterward Blal found some random wizzy who was in need of her piece from VS.  He dragged her corpse in, I rezzed her, she looted epic piece.  All for free.  You've never seen a happier player, she was giddy.<br>
<br>
<br>
2)  MB is just a cool toy.  It's funny watchin mobs drop so fast.  As soon as PoP comes out MB will end up being pretty much useless.<br>
<br>
3)  Not every class has an AA skill that can be considered unbalancing.  You ever take a look at the cleric AA skills?  Ooooo, innate ITU. <p><Br><img src="http://www.student.nvcc.vccs.edu/home/tlazaroff/CR.jpg" border="0">

I'm having fun reading this, keep this thread going =D.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think Bladari is refering to the day I went phsyco about the Maiden's eye lucid shard and said I would give both paladin books to anyone who let me loot it.  That was a joke /bonk...  Only reason I have both pally books is because gorenaire dropped 3 books on a single MB raid and I brought my low level pally to loot it to MQ later(unless I finally decide to level him up... still level 18 after 2 years).  Got Talendor book cause we killed Talendor late at night and I looted it for MQ as well, not profit.<br>
<br>
The wizards on Quellious, especially the ones with MB, are very good at communicating with each other(feel free to drop in wizard chat channel sometime wizard:draziw)  There are a few basic rules of decency we tend to abide by such as not running over raids that are forming already.  It might be hard to believe, but even wizards in &quot;uber&quot; guilds have guildmates that still need epic pieces, spells, and other kunark dragon loot.  I didn't even have sunstrike till last week! There are several clerics in guild without word of redemption still too.<br>
<br>
MB does have its use on mobs over 32k as well.  Shei and Sontalak are MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH easier with manaburn.  Quite honestly tho, I dont think there is any instance in which a 32khp+ mob would be ganked by 10+ MB wiz, its just not practical, and never would be.<br>
<br>
Oh, and nobody has even bothered to bitch about getting death touched by a wiz while standing in a PvP arena.  Thats so much fun to do =D.<br>
<br>
Thats all for now, I've gotta go farm some dragon epic loots so I can sell them at inflated prices.  I still need a lot more money to finish getting a stable full of each color of 100k horses.<br>

P.S.  It only takes 5 wiz to kill a dragon, not 6 (heck it only takes 4 wiz if they've all got decent gear), plus you usually bring along someone to pull dragon for you.  3 Wiz for VS, no puller =D.  Oh, and if you really wanabe uber, if you've got good mana gear and are lucky, you can solo VS if you crit manaburn, he's only got 17k <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontyydaogre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montyy Da Ogre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>fat ass</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/24/02 1:03:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=323.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This may touch some nerves, but WTF lets see what happen</span><hr size=1> I think this whole thing boils down to class balancing IMO.

And yes, I agree'd with the whole issue of the challenge.  But in my post I pointed out that these mobs were already being done mostly by people who the mob is trivialized to.  I also pointed out that a group of 6 &quot;holy trinity&quot; group can do the same as well.  So, is this because of MB? or just due to kunark mobs being trivial for folks who are level 60 with lots of AA points? Does it matter if the whole group is wizards? or a few diffent classes? Did that wedgie hurt? wait till Whytspirit hears you recieved a PUBLIC WEDGIE!!<br>
<br>
In all seriousness, I just don't like seeing people posting about how bad it is on our server or how it should be nerfed due to abuse by crying nerf over something that hasn't happened.<br>
<br>
Many classes recieved usefull abilities.<br>
<br>
- Does Dire Charm trivialize encounters? does it help guilds/raids skip content? <br>
<br>
- Ever see the log of the 60 Ranger with trueshot disc, endless quiver, crits, AA @#%$ fire off 53k damage in a little over 2 minutes on AoW with 0 agro because they were arrows? Does this make AoW easier and trivial to those who couldn't do it before?<br>
<br>
- Does Assasinating froggies/gorangas left and right for 32k a pop skip content? Does it trivialize the game on some mobs?<br>
<br>
- Is it morally wrong for a level 60 buff group to buff a vox raid so that the young-uns can skip that challenging content?<br>
<br>
- The new spell &quot;Spellshield&quot; trivialized Terror for our guild.  Does having this new spell allow us to skip content of having to fight Terror while your guild is eating his aoe's?<br>
<br>
I guess my point is that people asked to become more powerful.  They needed to progress and become stronger.<br>
<br>
In doing so this trivialized some of the games encounters.  I'm sure that when PoP comes out the uber-guilds will mostly have trivialized velious mobs to a point where its 'just something to do'.<br>
<br>
But for people to pick the Manaburn out of the many skills that may trivialize some encounters gets really old, just because someone see's one of those very rare crits of 18k.  If you pick MB out of the pack...take a look at all the classes, then you might be saying that maybe becoming stronger and more powerful isn't a good idea at all.<br>
<br>
If we never wanted to 'skip' content then some of us latecomers should only use 'old world' weapons and armor to kill kunark mobs like the old folks did when they started.  The challenge would be your MA in cobalt tanking vindicator like those before us.<br>
<br>
Hell, a great example of the progression of the game is the screenshot someone posted of a 40-50 person raid trying to drop phinny for the first time.  Now it takes 3 people if you do it right?<br>
<br>
In the end, every expansion trivializes those encounters before it.<br>
<br>
The only problem with progression is the ability for it to be abused severely.  I'll be the first to admit that ks'n and ganking mobs is very plausable for a MB team.  About as plausable as Vis, LC or wraith ks'n and ganking these mobs because they &quot;can&quot;.  But anyone who knows me, knows that I'm dead set against this kinda action.  This is a direct reflection upon those who do the deeds not the ability.<br>
<br>
MB'n on Quellious isn't like that.  If it changes in the future then don't expect me to defend them, I'll be the first to shove their pissy little *ninja-tormax's-head* nose through the bottom of norrath.<br>

P.S. I would keep an eye on Rapiki though.

<br>
as for class balance.  class balance is textbook subjective.  you cant balance classes in an objective sense.  there isnt really any numbers to compare.<br>
<br>
i mean how do you compare porting to damage/healing output.  how do you compare a bards ability to run to group usefulness.  what are they worth?  you can make reasonable statements but in the end its subjective.  its how you feel bout it.  <br>
<br>
your best attempt at damage output  is balancing say wizards and rogues via dps.  But that has stratification too.  i mean i can clear a 100 dps (estimate)on kunark mobs but i only pull 42 dps (20 minutes of parses) against a soul binder without buffs. that as a representative cause i can tell you acrylica felt worse then the soul binder for mitigation. so how do you deal with this mitigation discrepency.  rogues are scary damage against kunark/planer mobs but whats that worth in the balance?  now your back to subjective.  it varies by mob and situation.<br>
<br>
side note the myth is that casters have been falling behind in damage dealing because of ratio inflation.  but that simplistic view doesnt deal with the trump of indoor mob mitigation going through the roof.  casters arnt behind (ok chanters are behind).  caster balance will be amusing it might not go the way you think =)  last time i was in acrylica without attack/str buffs but with haste i honestly felt like a druid could have gave my rogue self a run for my money on damage output.  <br>
<br>
<br>
and that brings on another point of view.  what is dependance worth in balance.  again subjective.  i mean on one hand a paladin self haste is worthless doesnt need to be considered when comparing them to rangers.  on the other hand its mad power.  /shrug.   <br>
<br>
And then theres whats buffing worth.  whats it worth that i do my best damage with a sk in my group since luclin.  i mean if you were using a point system is it fair to add points to sk's cause they can buff a rogue to their highest damage.  ok a ranger can too but they have to dig into their single target buffs.<br>
<br>
where is the balance? its subjective.  so you hope when they go to tweaking it the guy with the point of view has a damn insightful one.<br>
<br>
personally i think they should avoid rebalancing issues.  dont break it.  its subjective so no matter where your at its right and its wrong.  leave it alone i say.  thats my matured view.  i remember distinctly saying when i was a young buck in 2000: that what people play in terms of hours should be an indicator.  a measure of fun factor. its flawed but somewhat insightful.  i mean a druid can argue till they are blue in the face that they suck but as long as they are enjoying the hell out of their ports and their roles its muted slightly.  but that is a simplistic view. a sort of unfair one.<br>
<br>
i lean to of course its broke DONT FIX IT cause you arnt wise enough as my official mock advise to verant.<br>

<br>
Every skill in the game has its perks, and it has its negatives.  For instance druids got SoE, soe is good for running atop of mountains without having to worry about falling for 100+dmg.  But sometimes SoE is used to run around KC 3 times and aggro all the mobs and train zone in.  It just depends how much of an ass the druid/player is. =)<br>
<br>
I myself honestly have heard of manaburn doing more good then harm, as mentioned before its a &quot;toy&quot; have fun with it.  <br>
<br>
I like to think of manaburn as your basic woman, she is always your friend and is there for you.  Untill that time of the month when she becomes a bitch.<br>

I disagree with the notion that wizards get the best AA... <br>
<br>
A few nice abilities here and there but generally most of them are useless.. about 75 AA is all a wizard will need.. While a melee can get over 120 and still need more.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rangers and Paladins are the two I checked that get the best AA.<br>
<br>
Clerics are the worst.<br>

The number of zones you can get a dire charm pet with dps that is actually decent is very small.  <br>
<br>
There is no effective way for chanters to solo outside of having a dire charmed pet.  You can have 255 charisma/int and still lose a normal charm 6 seconds after casting it (400 mana aka 10% of my mana pool per cast of that).  OMG but Verant gave us dictate so we could have a set duration/unresistable so what are the chanters complaining about?  Oh yeah it only lasts for 48 seconds and has a 5 minute refresh in addition to costing 750 mana.<br>
<br>
Someone who thinks ae groups are way too easy, require no skill, and are the best exp in the game needs to do it on a more frequent basis.  AEing is very class specific and if you don't have the proper classes to continue with the group then you're sol.  Most other groups will take whoever comes along to fill a spot in a group, an ae group has to wait for one certain class.  I dont deny that ae is good exp but once you take into consideration downtime for deaths, waiting for replacement group members, afks, etc it's not that much better than normal exp.  I shouldn't be forced to rely upon a certain type of group for my exp, what's wrong with giving me the ability to solo effectively?  The question regarding &quot;how many chanters/wizards do you know with 50+ aa&quot; is silly considering the fact I know a lot more melee classes with that many.  I myself only have 46 and I've done maybe 5 of those points with ae.<br>
<br>
Oh and here's just how overpowered dire charm pets are:<br>
1.  If you go LD they're lost until you refresh the 72 MINUTE cast time.<br>
2.  If you get trained and have to zone you lose it until you refresh the 72 MINUTE cast time.<br>
3.  If your pet dies for any reason you can't get another until you refresh the 72 MINUTE cast time<br>
4.  If your group evacs for any reason you lose it until you refresh the 72 MINUTE cast time.<br>
<br>
Dire charm is my laugh in the face at any person who's ever asked me for buffage while soloing but can't take the exp cut into their solo work to group me as well.  I'm sorry my pet does more dps than the character you've leveled up from 1-60 but sometimes that's just the way the cookie crumbles.  Quit crying and get over the fact that me &gt; you in maybe 6 zones in the entire game?<br>

However someone mentioned that peeps no longer need any of the kunark dragons ? Do you have your head in the clouds ? you may not need them, I do not either...<br>

...Question....<br>
<br>
How many warriors do you see with epic ?  <br>
<br>
...Answer....<br>
<br>
Not many after all of this time.  Sure a lot of the other guilds who have been epic enabled have moved on, but still other guilds who aint capable of getting better weapons...they still dont have their epic.<br>
<br>
Every warrior wants their epic, whether they are in the most uber guild or not.  It is a status thing and there are rumours of an upgrade on the base warrior epic.  <br>

They could make the warrior epic 10 times as good as it is now and it would still suck.<br>

Using the arguement &quot;even tho the warrior epic sucks people still want it as a status symbol&quot; is crap... you can use the same arguement, or a variation of it, to describe any item in the game.

But it is relevant to the discussion (not argument).  All you need to do is visit www.steelwarrior.org and find posts in relation to the epic. <br>
<br>
Whilst some of the warriors are in powerful guilds, they still want their epic (which is still pretty good for the most of us) as a status symbol.<br>
<br>
Dont wanna drag off topic - as it is relevant for warriors who are otherwise unable to obtain their epic (as status or main use) and need the Kunark dragons in order to obtain them.    <br>

ROFLMAO! I have a 53 warrior, he can solo about 5 times more efficiently than Blal could at 53. Fungi, slow weapon, over 1000 AC, self buffs. You melee's have never had it easier to get xp. Dont go complaining at me and my fellow casters cus we decide once were not wanted by the melees that can heal themselves, buff themselves (or rather ask for buffs but not group up), and do more damage over time than any caster can, if we make a group without the melees that didnt want to group.<br>
<br>
Montyy, i like you, but your starting to show your dumb ogre colours in this thread. You have no idea how difficult it was pre- SoL for wizards to get a group. We have discovered one thing that actually requires us in a group for it to be succesful and you complain. Go solo in FG, but stay out of my way when i pull for my AE group.<br>

3. The warrior epic may indeed suck, but to this day no weapon to my knowledge looks as cool, and I want it for that fact alone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

rofl you hippy bastage,I'm not talking about twinks mate <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I wholeheartedly agree that any sort of twinked out melee is gonna own a caster just due to the types of gear available to them.
