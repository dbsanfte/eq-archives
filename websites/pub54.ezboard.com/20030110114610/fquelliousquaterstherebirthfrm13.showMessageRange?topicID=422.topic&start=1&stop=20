<br>
Well, for the first time in a long time, Alle is speechless. I'm not going say I don't know what happened. Okay well, maybe I will...wtf happened? I can assume so much, but then again in the past few weeks, so many assumptions have been made. And as we all know...when you assume...blah blah <br>
blah. <br>
<br>
Assumption #1 - Fear (yes it all goes back to this). I never said the drop was mine. I never said it was defaulted to me. Nald (I'm so sorry to drag you into this hun) has logs that show me telling him that Sodi and I were to roll on it. <br>
<br>
Assumption #2 - I assumed that everything was fine. It hit me rather hardyesterday afternoon when I saw this pop up on my screen : <br>
<br>
[Thu Jul 25 13:04:06 2002] Pistonn tells you, 'Gonna make this short and sweet.  We've decided to terminate you from LM.  I wish you the best in Vis or LC, and I'm sorry it didnt work out... but the officers have decided it's best for LM.  I'm sorry' <br>
[Thu Jul 25 13:04:12 2002] Mystianna tells ae:1, 'Yes please' <br>
[Thu Jul 25 13:04:15 2002] You are no longer a member of Lor Mani. <br>
<br>
So because no one had come to ME to tell ME that they were unhappy with MY actions, behaviour, thoughts, whatever, I had erroneously assumed that all was peachy. <br>
<br>
Now for some facts. <br>
<br>
Fact #1 - I was not happy. I have not been happy for a very long time. However because someone once told me to put a smile on and fake it, that's what I have been doing. I guess you could say this all started around the time of Ragefire. After a few weeks of sitting there and not doing much of <br>
anything, when the time came that we were actually able to do stuff, I was like, what now? Don't get me wrong, I loved being able to sit there for Syllie. When we took him out I was so proud of everything that Lor Mani had done and stood for. <br>
<br>
Fact of the matter is, I've been bored. I love the raids we go on, but I wanted more of them. Then after Fear, I made the mistake to comment on something in a totally unrelated post. And Quas yes, Alle will be Alle...you can not change a person. However (and here's where we really get into the dirt), Quas's reply to that post floored me. It honestly hurt. Regardless of <br>
what many of you think, I am a person behind that avatar. So, because the post was deleted I'm going to respond to it now. <br>
<br>
Quas...you made 3 points. Point #1...it was Mali's raid. Yes, it was. And he could have called it as soon as he got the golem. But he didn't. He told me that he'd like to see us get the shissar the next morning. That is why he asked everyone to be there early to beat the other guilds. <br>
<br>
Point #2...we had gotten 2 of my hardest mobs earlier in the week. Yes we did. I have no defense for that one because you're right. And I'm thankful. You didn't have to come help, you could have said we're busy. But you didn't. What happened earlier in the week, does not change what could have happened in Fear. It's all a game of chance and luck and being in the right spot at the right time. <br>
<br>
Point #3...Sodina's feelings. While I agree that you may have felt that I - what was it you said - stomped all over her feelings. Not even considering them. No, I did not. I spoke to her the night before. Once again assumptions were made. If someone had stopped to ask me, they would have been told I was rolling on it. Whatever bad feelings came from this, I apologize. <br>
<br>
So, when I saw the post that ripped me apart, in public no less, I was very upset. Upset at myself for acting like that, and upset at Quas for posting in such a public manor. A simple, Alle we need to talk, or Alle STFU, or Alle, send me an email and we could have cleared this up. So I started thinking about leaving. The only person I had talked to at this point was Naldaas...who for 2 weeks begged me to reconsider. I had no idea where I would go, or what I would do. I only mentioned LC because I had thought of following Rithum who happens to be a RL friend of mine. Naldaas begged and <br>
pleaded with me to talk to Syllie. That she of all people would understand. So I did. I told her what I was thinking and feeling. I asked her if I could be honest. And so, I...no, I'm not going to go any further with this. I love Syllie like a member of my family and she did nothing wrong here. <br>
<br>
As for my &quot;complaining&quot;...yes, I can get vocal when I'm upset. In Fear (damn it always comes back to this doesn't it), I bitched for 15 minutes in group, guild, and raid channel...then after that said NOTHING for over 2 hours (I have the log files to prove this). Once again, a simple Alle STFU would have <br>
done wonders. <br>
<br>
Quas, I don't hate you and I never have. I have looked up to you as something / someone I had wanted to be like. I admired your patience in doing all those quests, knowing I would never be able to be like that. You had my respect for your leadership and your opinions...maybe still have...I <br>
don't know, I'm still reeling from this. <br>
<br>
So, where do we go from here? Not eniterly sure. Connavar asked me if I changed my behaviour and was asked to come back, would I. I can't answer that right now. I think that if I came back, I would feel too much like I had to watch what I did and said, and that's not me. Not saying that you're <br>
even ever going to ask me to come back...just telling you how I feel, which got me into trouble in the first place. I wanted to end this with a little something I found that somehow fits this situation perfectly. <br>
<br>
~~~ <br>
I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons. <br>
Finally content with a past I regret. <br>
I've come to find strength in your moments of weakness, <br>
for once I'm at peace with myself. <br>
I've been burdoned with blame, trapped in the past for too long. <br>
I'm moving on. <br>
<br>
I'm moving on, where at last I can see, life has been patiently waiting for me, <br>
And I know, there's no guarantees, but I'm not alone. <br>
There comes a time, in everyone's life, when all you can see are the years pass you by, <br>
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone. <br>
<br>
I've lived in this place and I know all the faces. <br>
Each one is different, but they're always the same. <br>
They mean me no harm, but it's time that I'm facing <br>
They'll never allow me to change. <br>
And I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong. <br>
I'm moving on. <br>
<br>
I've sold what I could, packed what I couldn't <br>
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town. <br>
I've loved like I should, but lived like I shouldn't <br>
I had to lose everything to find out. <br>
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down the road. <br>
I'm moving on. <br>
~~~ <br>
<br>

<br>
This will be my one post on the subject... and then I'm letting it go.<br>
<br>
After I detagged Alleusion... I posted the following in our member boards:<br>
<br>
____________________________________<br>
As many who were online already know, Alle has been removed from Lor Mani. The reasons were numerous, and I don’t feel that it’ll be productive to go into them all.<br>
<br>
Suffice it to say that a significant number of people have approached the officers with complaints concerning her attitude and almost constant complaining… both in guild chat, and in direct tells.<br>
<br>
After more than a few 2nd chances, we have decided that Alle will be Alle, and that she will not change… and that her continued presence in Lor Mani is a detriment to morale, and to the Guild in general.<br>
<br>
I am sorry that it has come to this and, contrary to popular opinion, I wish her well in her future endeavors… and I hope she finds her happiness.<br>
____________________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Alleusion's history in Lor Mani has been one of constant complaining, and selfish (to the point of childish) behavior.  We lost damn good people because we officers didnt address this situation sooner... and the people who left did so to get away from &quot;the Alle Drama&quot;.<br>
<br>
Alle WAS in fact approached on multiple occassions to change her ways.  Her attempts at doing so were fleeting at best.<br>
<br>
Her whining in Guild Chat during the Fear raid was the final straw... as the LM officers were finally fed up with firlding complaints about her attitude.  She ran out of second chances, and was terminated.<br>
<br>
And Alle... that you for quoting my message.  Maybe it would have been nice to quote your reply.<br>
<br>
Since I'm not one to log all of my conversations... this may be slightly less than perfect... but it went something like this...<br>
<br>
&quot;How can you do this to me?  I havent decided yet&quot;<br>
<br>
Even at the end... it's all about Alle thinking about herself.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your adventures across Norrath. <p><center>

Complaining and bitching, while may seem annoying, is something to attempt to fix a situation for the better.<br>

Fast foward to to late 40's early 50's, Alle Detags from LM to join 5E, because she felt &quot;left out&quot; because the lvl 60's in the guild wouldnt drop everything they were doing and group with her and pay her attention, and she wasnt able to go on raids where there was a level limit.  Well about a week after joining 5E, she finds that she wont be able to raid with them until she hits 55, so she comes back crying that she made a huge mistake and could she come home /sigh<br>
<br>
Now Epic, you have been whining non stop about your damn Epic since mid 40's asking people to help you on it non stop, even on the parts that you could very easily do solo (I know cuz I did them all with my chanter) wanting to host 'raids' that were nothing more than LM getting YOU epic drops.  You whined at 45 and whined even more after you AE'd your way to 60.<br>
<br>
Now recently you say that you are going to leave LM.../cheer, then change yer mind...then a few people tell me you wanted to recruit with LC or Vis, but was unable to do with either due to lack of Epic, hmmm, so you planned on staying in LM and whining even more until you get the rest of your epic drops and THEN left to recruit with LC/Vis?<br>
<br>
Please get over yourself, you have been nothing more than a whiney SOB since I first encountered you, and havent changed.... LM is better off without you.<br>

I just never said anything about it to anyone because I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. However, now that I don't play anymore I don't give a damn =p I don't blame the LM officers for booting her. Also, it seems like all this was settled on the LM boards, and she's now trying to draw it out into an endless dramatic debate for attention on this board. Way to prove everyone elses point!<br>

Alle, this goes back to long before Fear.. This actually started sometime around Vinnie leaving LM, if not slightly before that. I personally like you as a one-on-one person, from the conversations we've had - but my Christ, you honestly can outwhinge both of DoSG's biggest windbags (you know who you are, guys<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) with one hand tied behind your back! It's not a one off recent thing that no-one has tried to talk to you about, either.. You've been spoken to repeatedly over the months about it, whenever it gets really bad. Then from what I've seen you quieten down, and actually start to enjoy playing again for a while. At which point someone seems to give the monkey a fresh banana, because the whole damn organ starts up grinding again.<br>
<br>
Give it up, love, and just drop this now. You aren't going to win any new friends by slagging off the officership of a guild with the standing of LM, and you may just lose a few of your existing ones.<br>
