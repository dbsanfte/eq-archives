Stylee can smile all he or she wants, I grouped with him/her once and I said I would never do it again (not that I intend to log back in anyways) ----  Useless warrior, useless ability and know-all attitude.  <br>
<br>
I just STFU and let him/her do her thing (which was incidentally done very badly).  <br>
<br>
I agree also that old Wraith were more skilled...they had some awesome people when I was in it, now they appear to just be more numbers than ability. (Thuulsa, Muffo, Jagg, Boldair, Samsonn, Droz, Redlance, Paeg, Treeweaver, Balily, Plug for example - slap me if I forgot you)<br>
<br>
Not singling Wraith out though, I have found many guilds to be of the same mirrored qualities.  <br>

Wraith disbanded primarily because of disparate timezones. It crippled us. Half the guild was Euro and these guys ended up waiting longer for raids to start (to get enough to engage) and hence also staying up late day after day. We eventually couldn't work around that issue. As far as I remember Wraith was holding it's own quite well at the time it disbanded and had recently done some server firsts (Statue, Jorlleag, Ikatiar, PoM, etc.). Point being, dont flatter yourself. VM had nothing to do with Wraith's originally disbanding.<br>
<br>
Raluvin,<br>
<br>
I agree the original Wraith had some extremely skilled players, and a bunch of them are in VM / LC now. As far as comparison, I'd say we hold our own and you unfortunately can't compare since you used to be in old Wraith and you haven't raided with us in the new one. Our accomplishments speak for themselves. <br>

Hrm, well. I think personally with the arriving of luclin certain aspects of the game changed alot, one thing that changed was that a &quot;normal sized&quot; raidforce (per vis maiors definition) changed from a top of mayhaps 40 45 up towards a number of even so much as 70+, vis maior just dont have, nor have vis maior ever have that kind of numbers.<br>
<br>
I often do a /who in zones I am in, and I frequently see both lc and wraith/reviv with number counts of 80 and more. <br>
<br>
So naturally it hurt a little, I for one dont sit and bite my nails at evening and I dont believe any of the other vm members do either and think &quot;omg what if X guild kills this before us&quot;.<br>
<br>
As for accomplishments in this expansion, hrm well..there has been many members and many old friends of mine that left the guild, and I hope they found their fun elsewhere, right now there are perhaps out of the 40 45 I used to know, perhaps 6 members left of the crew I was running with.<br>
<br>
Still only have 2 mobs left to kill in Luclin, I dont think its a superbad record, rebuilding takes time.<br>
<br>
And Desi, what accomplishments have Wraith actually made on their own lately?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time,<br>

<br>
that's just my observation.  if wraith wasn't pushing so hard to beat VM, you think timezone would be a problem? i still remember what wraith tried to do to beat VM to mobs..sit in DN for 2 days to wait for zland to pop, sit in ww for hrs to wait for kland to pop, sit in icewell to wait for dain to pop, etc etc.  those really..hmm...faustred a lot of wraith members.  Add in all the training and trash talking between both guilds.  End up having tons of ppl quit EQ/guild from both guilds during that period.  Both guilds were hurt badly that time.  Took Vm a very long time to rebuild. And wraith finally call it quit because ppl didn't feel like having fun and stop logging in (o well..there were some internal problems too).  Maybe that's just me, but I really think Wraith pushed their members away by trying too hard to beat VM.  <br>
<br>
Anyway..that's some history and my opinion as a VM at that time, you don't have to agree with me. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uturkee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Turkee </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sebilite Guardian</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/3/02 10:40:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Somewhere out there, Stylee is smiling............</span><hr size=1> Woow describes my view during that timeperiod perfect. <br>
<br>
In your defense Desi, I will agree, when you guys pulled off Statue, and Zland, and got extremely close on Yelinak, right on the heels of us doing it (minus Statue) I started to worry that Wraith was actually gonna catch up to us. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately a few key Wraith members quit. That was for the most part, the end of the Wraith vs. Vis saga. <br>
<br>
In my opinion, although I didnt stick around much longer after that all happen, Vis got lazy without Wraith around, never worried about Lotus really, then wham out of nowhere, hey there goes Lotus zipping right by. <br>
<br>
Throw in a few other key factors with Lotus and Vis history, and well, you've heard all of this before from someone. <br>
<br>
I dont know about the numbers that you're putting at raids Desi, but I will say that regardless if you use 200 people or not (and yah I would give ya a hard time about it in game) but regardless of anything, if you kill a mob, you kill a mob. <br>
<br>
So as you put it, cheers, to your success. <br>

I don't think it was that...  Occy left because it was time to go correct?  Most people can't raid constantly for years on a consistant basis. Also people get burned out.<br>
<br>
In most cases when a guildleader leaves a guild the guild will struggle or fail.. Vis struggled for a bit then Luclin hit and suddenly most guilds needed to double their raid roster to raid luclin.. Vis did this faster than others because they wanted to maintain a good pace.. invited some  questionable players then eventually a large section of the guild moved on because they were tired of failing due to the questionable players.<br>
<br>
That correct?<br>
<br>
Desaran,<br>
<br>
Descent fell apart directly because of Vis.. Kalsto wanted to beat Vis to the top and the guild wasn't ready so he left.<br>

I don't think that's the case, Gae. He did have the second guild, Antiquity. I was in it. I remember Dachunker and Aspro being in it, Spiritjazz, I think Zenfe and Xaliya, Saelamdar and Staboo, damn, who else? When he told me about it he said the goal was a smaller, tighter guild.<br>
<br>
And he's anything but retired. Pop onto Sullon Zek and check out guild Vindictive. <p><center>
