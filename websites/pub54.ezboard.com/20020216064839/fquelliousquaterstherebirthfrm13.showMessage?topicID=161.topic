I figure it's time. Warning - there is some graphic language.. so please be careful.<br><br>I've been following this news on &quot;the mistreatment of the Afghani PoWs&quot; and I'm appalled that the liberal pundits, Amnesty International and the European Union are all up in arms about the lack of hugs and kisses being given to these people. <br><br>***************  Edit  **************<br>The link I originally posted was moved and so I deleted it, but it basically detailed how the European community, Amnesty Int'l and the media circus was &quot;concerned&quot; over America's harsh treatment of the detainees captured during the conflict in Afganistan.<br>***************  Edit ***************<br><br>First of all, much of the European community should stop criticizing what we do and start kissing American a$$ every friggin day for the next 200 years because we saved them and their cultures from extinction a couple of times in the last century. Everyone gets up in our face about every little thing the U.S. does yet no one recalls with any detail how damned close you all were to speaking German. Only German. Twice.<br><br>We should have given the Amnesty International folks the &quot;clean up the body parts&quot; detail down at the World Trade Center. That would open up their eyes a little bit and let a bias or two form. They need to personally smell the northerly winds in Manhatten and the horrid stink of decayed flesh on those warm October days. I'm here every day. They need a little more tough love in their cushy little lives.<br><br>With regard to the prisoners being held in Cuba... you know the best part about being a nasty, sweaty, hairy muslim terrorist in Guatanamo Bay? The humidity. There's no humidity where they came from so this is REALLY causing a major problem with their islamic ball cheese. I hope they all get a bad case of festering fungus on their luggage. Or maybe a few infections from all the bugs and things which are biting them. (They are, after all, in a jungle.) F*ck, I'd apply a thin layer of honey to their bedsheets every day to attract all the fire ants and nasty nasties which crawl around at night. Could you imagine waking up to 1000 biting bugs crawling over and around your body??? That's a little payback.<br><br>Oh, and I'd make sure that they ingested one pound of WTC wreckage each day. I'd cut up all the pieces of cement, steel, glass and aluminum into little rectangular pieces and personally serve them on a breakfast plate every morning to each prisoner...<br><br>&quot;Don't give me that sh*t, Abdul - start chomping. And don't you bitch to me that it hurts when you craap. F*ck you, I hope it burns. Either grow a square sphincter or next time you get an urge to knock down some f*cking towers, pick a little dipsh*t no-load country like Grenada or Sri Lanka that won't roll up on you with about a million pissed-off elite troops and beat you like a dirty f*cking Walmart rug. You should have gone to talk to Emporor Hirohito and his motley band of lunatics - they tried that sh*t in 1941 and we broke *two* off in their a$$es at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You should feel absolutely Lotto-lucky that we have some nutless political dip-weasels in Congress right now or we'd have turned YOUR dust-ridden home town into a glowing pond of liquid glass on September 12.&quot;<br><br>And to those Roger and Eberts of the &quot;international socio-political critics and Monday morning quarterbacks&quot; club, take your complaints, your whining and your &quot;let's-try-to-help-them-because-they-are-helpless&quot; rhetoric and jam them back into your collective a$$. I don't *want* the people who killed 3000 friends of ours and afterwards *celebrated* the event to get away without a little discomfort in their lives. If you don't know what it feels like, send Osama bin Hidin' YOUR headquarters address and hand him a low-flying 767 with a few fanatics on board and *then* we can talk shop.<br><br>Until then, shut your pieholes and let the people who are actually making this planet a little bit safer to live on do their jobs. No, it's not pretty and this sh*t will get worse before it gets better but at least we're doing SOMETHING more than flinging words and hugs around the globe. And when your kids grow up without the spectre of terrorism looming over them like some nightmarish apparition, you won't be so fast to criticize the acts and events going on in the world right now.<br><br>Well.. that's it for now. I'm shutting off the news and will go bust a few heads in The Grey now.  I feel sorry for those Shissar.. they know not with whom they are about to f*ck. <br><br>Daku <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/udakuinochi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daku Inochi</A> at: 1/28/02 3:04:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uyopt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yopt</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.aol.com/yopt/Yopt.bmp" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/22/02 3:21:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really steams my clams (off EQ-topic)</span><hr size=1> Right behind you bud.  <br><br>And for anyone who is even thinking about giving him @#%$ about this post.......... hop on the next flight to NYC and come see me.  /rude <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugimily.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gimily</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/22/02 4:22:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really steams my clams (off EQ-topic)</span><hr size=1> About all I can say about that is well.....<br><br><br><br><br>YARRRRRR!!!!!<br><br><br>Great rant hah! <p><img src="http://www.lotuscult.com/~gimily/Gimily2.gif"><BR><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=21865" target=_blank>My Gear</a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwooweewoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wooweewoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/22/02 4:42:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really steams my clams (off EQ-topic)</span><hr size=1> I was going to post a long rant about daku's post.

That would open up their eyes a little bit and let a bias or two form. They need to personally smell the northerly winds in Manhattan and the horrid stink of decayed flesh on those warm October days.&quot;<br><br>I don't like pushing red tape as much as the next person but Amnesty International is simply one of those watchdogs we need. Just like you pointed out the good that the US has done, they could be responsible for changing the outcome of elections, or at least perceptions, across the world. They leak information to the media bringing attention to global massacres we otherwise wouldn't catch wind of, and put public pressure on Islamic governments (including Egypt) who insist on female mutilation although the Qu'ran doesn't condone the practice. As a woman I'm grateful for that.<br><br>I have a feeling they're raising a stink because they suspect torture going on. And you know what? Their suspicions are probably right on the money. Don't delude yourself into thinking we're going to let the enemy officer with top-secret information go quietly into that goodnight. Torture is not something any country would brag about, but it is practiced. Personally I don't have a problem with it (with one notable exception), including assassination, as long as we don't gasp with indignant rage shouting &quot;How dare they!&quot; when our techniques are copied and practiced on our own. It is extremely scary how easily one collection of people will justify actions against another collection without looking into the mirror. I could always recognize them at Safety Stand Downs. They were swept away by emotion.<br><br>&quot;Could you imagine waking up to 1000 biting bugs crawling over and around your body?&quot;<br><br>Four words. Paris Island and sand fleas.

We could take a step in the right direction to avoid another such tragedy if we make political maneuvers to have every UN country write up a draft for extradition laws. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  That</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> takes more resolve than a war.<br><br>Yes, some idiots danced in front of the camera. But how's the following for flame bait? IMO many stations are owned by Jews and/or are affiliated with one another. I'm not saying CNN warps the truth, but I don't think they present the whole truth either. What you don't air is as important as what you do. I can't nod my head to the idea that the majority of these people think it's just swell that innocent people died. I'm not that f-cking naive.<br><br>It is in the interest of these groups to present a side that will raise/keep US support when it comes to making international treaties. I also think the US has, for the most part, unfailingly supported Israel due to Biblical ties and the idea that in the end God will round up Israel's enemies and send them headlong to hell (Apocalypse). Yeah, it sounds like wild speculation, but I don't understand why we haven't asked Israel to put an end to the Law of Return, enacted since WW2. Basically it states that any Israeli may return to the homeland if they so choose. So...what happens when you underestimate the number of people who will return? Resources are stretched until the quality of life goes down. At that point you have to make new plans to meet the need, and part of the plan involves land. If Mexico decided they wanted to take a piece of Texas, or Canada wanted to exert it sovereignty and push the border down you'd be pissed too. And if the only weapon you had was a rock you'd throw it as well.

Why do they beat their own women into submission for showing a mere finger in public?  There were reports of a 70 year old elderly Afghan woman who was beaten because she had a stray hair poking out of her birka.  Why should we support a culture like that?  What we're doing over there, eliminating the Taliban, actually benefits the Afghan people.  Women are now significantly freer than they were 4 months ago.  They are even free to hold office.  I know who my enemies are, and they're the people who knowingly harbored the man who masterminded the death of over 3000 of my people.

If you came across an attacker on the street who proceeded to beat you with a baseball club, attempting to break your bones, would you just stand there and take it, or would you attempt to retaliate?

Those Afghan citizens being watched over by HR groups are not the people that are responsible for the deaths during the attack. Instead of shooting your mouth off with rhetoric, read the arguments being put forth.<br><br>&gt;What about the rights of all those children whose mommies &gt;and daddies were killed mercilessly for merely going to work &gt;to bring home the bacon for them to eat? What about the &gt;rights of all those parents who lost their children that day? &gt;What about the rights all those innocent firefighters, police &gt;officers, and EMT whose main goal was to dive into that &gt;death trap in attempts to save a few lives but ended up &gt;losing their own?<br><br>What does abusing the Afghani people do to rectify this problem. Of course, it is a horrible situation, but the point is that that HR groups around the world are (and should be) concerned with violations of rights being taken by the US military towards the Afghani people. I would hate for Afghanistan, a country in dire straits before we arrived and will be for some time after, to have to lose 3000 of their countrymen because you decide it is alright to violate their rights.<br><br>&gt;Why should we support a culture like that? What we're doing &gt;over there, eliminating the Taliban, actually benefits the &gt;Afghan people. Women are now significantly freer than they &gt;were 4 months ago. They are even free to hold office. I &gt;know who my enemies are, and they're the people who &gt;knowingly harbored the man who masterminded the death of &gt;over 3000 of my people. If they're so willing to die for their &gt;cause, why weren't they willing to die protesting what they &gt;felt was right, unless of course, they felt that what bin &gt;Laden was doing is right.<br><br>Your not understanding the difference between the government and the people. Our government has continually done unjust things that the people of the US haven't been in the streets willing to die for. You have to grip the concept of the people and the state. The state (Taliban) is responsible for policy. The people in their form of government are responsible for supporting the government. Nothing more, they have no imput. Resistance would be futile, much like American's never protested the sterilizing of Jews or the death camps for Japanese Americans during WW2. Your arguing two seperate things which don't work together.<br><br>&gt;If they're so willing to die for their cause, why weren't they &gt;willing to die protesting what they felt was right, unless of &gt;course, they felt that what bin Laden was doing is right.<br><br>As I said in my previous post, look in a global facts book or an encylopedia. The people (again your being confused) likely had no idea that Bin Laden was doing anything. I would even go so far as to say that the Taliban govt. had no idea what was going on. In terrorists acts, the fewer the people that know the more chance of success that you have. Once again, the government is being punished by the US for their involvement in the past with Bin Laden. There is no reason whatsoever to punish the people. That is what these HR groups are protesting.<br><br>I'll leave it there as this is getting very long. Please read arguments and respond thoughtfully. Rhetoric just doesn't cut it.<br><br>Nick <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uveers669.showPublicProfile?language=EN>veers669</A> at: 1/22/02 11:46:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugypsysongman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gypsy Songman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Lout</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/23/02 2:46:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.houston.rr.com/neuromt/pwned.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really steams my clams (off EQ-topic)</span><hr size=1> So your girlfriend/sister/daughter/etc gets kidnapped by a group of thugs and is raped and brutalized.

The police go and search the place, find evidence, and arrest the bastards (after some old-fashioned garden hose whippings) for their crime.
