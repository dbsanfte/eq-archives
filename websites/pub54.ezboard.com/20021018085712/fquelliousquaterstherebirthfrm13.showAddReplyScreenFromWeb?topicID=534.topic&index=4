eh?</span><hr size=1> I'm glad you posted this. Not only do I still believe we were in the right (both circumstantially and morally as you have me quoted), but re-reading your post and your log reinforces that feeling. At first I did feel a bit guilty. Hell I feel guilty every time we have to play a race in this game because we really do like to get along with everyone. However, UP have been such collossal dicks to us over the past couple months, its hard to feel remorse. In the end the guilt passed though. Its hard to contain that feeling after listening to your pack of lies and half-truths. Lets lay down some facts why don't we concerning Cazel, then we'll move on to Hate. And after we discuss Hate, we'll talk about a little incident in Umbral Plains not too long ago (while we're airing dirty laundry), and how about another incident in Hate that occurred a couple months ago. Sound good? No. Too fucking bad. Here we go.<br>
<br>
Cazel:<br>
We hear in guild from a guildmate that Cazel is up. Ok! Mobilization. &quot;Oh wait guys, enc from UP is here kiting him.&quot; Alright, stand down, wait it out, see what happens. About 10 minutes passes and we find out if Cazel is engaged. Nope, still being kited around. So we port to Sro, move to Oasis. That takes about 5 minutes. When we finally get there we see an enchanter, a low level paladin and an enchanter pet fear kiting. We announce that we're going to engage Cazel in 2 minutes if sufficient force isn't there to take him down. We wait 5. Thats about 20 minutes total now of kiting and dicking around and Cazel's life is bouncing from 99% to 100% back and forth. When it becomes painfully clear that nothing is going to happen here, we kill him. I don't believe it was a kill steal, nor do I think we were in the wrong. We did wait for quite some time.<br>
<br>
Hate this weekend:<br>
We gather our force in South Ro for port up and notice UP there too. We make it clear that we are going into Hate so it looks like you start to speed up the process. Fine. You port your 13 people up about 5 minutes before we do. When we get in we see UP corpses strewn from port-in to safe camp. Ok, whatever. At this point we decide to have nothing to do with UP and move to a seperate area. So we fight into the plane. As we get to the safe camp area we are suddenly trained by about 15-20 mobs (Quechan could probably give a better estimate), and I noticed half your raid went LD or died from your own train. Thats fine. We handled the mobs. But it was a nice try on your part. We appreciate the xp, however this did piss us off something mighty. We were going to seperate from your raid and do our own thing, but some dickhead in your group thought it would be more fun to bring a wiper. (that didn't work)<br>
<br>
Umbral:<br>
This is where we get into the false accusations. As I recall we were doing a meatloaf raid in umbral (Tawro/Radir, as in &quot;aww mom, meatloaf AGAIN?&quot;) and Lauriston recieves a tell from a UP member. I think it was Ulwern but I'm not sure. This member starts making all sorts of accusations that a bard named &quot;Wintyr&quot; had trained and killed them all in the ice cave the previous evening. Funny that, Wintyr happens to be ME and I don't remember that at all considering I was playing Trist and killing Golems in Fear that night. Nice try once again. I ~do~ recall the evening previous to the one in question where I came upon an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> already wiped out</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Unruled raid in the ice cave while playing Wintyr and offered to drag your cleric's corpse into the cave safely. The cleric's response? &quot;Nice try asshole.&quot; Clearly playing nice with you people isn't going to work. I kicked on travel song and moved on.<br>
<br>
Hate, the first incident:<br>
This is where it all began I believe. Long time ago, at least in EQ reference. Both our guilds ported up to Hate at about the same time. You guys began clearing 1st floor. One of our people spoke with one of your people and an agreement had been made that we would take 2nd, you would take 1st floor. We thought this was great because at the time we held UP in pretty high regard and we just like working together with other guilds in general. Well apparently some miscommunication happened somewhere in there and the high ups in UP decided that they did ~not~ want to share the plane at all. When we heard this some harsh words were exchanged, but in the end we camped out for another day so as not to cause a fuss. We genuinely liked UP back then. My how things have changed. :P<br>
<br>
All that aside, I have to say this for Radiant. Not in defense, we need none. I believe our guild name speaks for itself and need not be defended. I speak in the context of contradicting slander:<br>
<br>
I have never in my time playing Everquest come across a more selfless group of people. People willing to go to extraordinary measures just to makes sure someone gets something they need. Even to perfect strangers. People willing to give out ME shards for free (knowing that they could fetch a pretty PP if they wanted), because they know a person going to VT is really going to fucking enjoy themselves. People willing to drop everything they are doing to help kill Ragefire, or rogue General, or Trakanon or whatever for a little known acquaintance for the simple satisfaction that they know they are going to make someone in this game happy and screw the loot.<br>
<br>
I think just about anyone that has dealt with us can attest to our moral character as a guild. When you say &quot;Good ole Radiant&quot; in a sneering tone, I don't take that as an insult but look upon it with pride. Because regardless of how you might say it, you're still saying the words, Good ole Radiant.<br>
<br>
Oy.<br>

To Punkass Gypsy - you say in your post that you go to great lengths to help people, even strangers.  Why then did you not offer your assistance to the enchanter who was trying desperately to hold aggro and keep damage going on Cazel while her friends got to the scene?<br>
<br>
As far as whatever the incident in Fear was - there is no log of that. If there is it is not posted and until there is a log it is he said/she said.  I saw the log of the Cazel situation as will many others.  And pleeeeeease don't use the excuse that &quot;we have a good reputation&quot; to hide behind..  if those involved were truly &quot;better&quot; and &quot;more mature&quot; than the people in UP instead of holding grudges and perpetuating what seems to be like a poorly handled misunderstanding, take the high road and offer out your hand in friendship and give your help.. that will take you further than anything any mob will ever drop in any game.<br>

You're absolutely right. Had it been an enchanter from any other guild we probably would have backed off or just helped. But we were still smarting from the racing game/train game UP had pulled on us the day before and it became a match of 'eye for an eye'. (Even though in the Cazel case we could have just walked in, killed, walked out. We waited a good long time) We've tried the high road with them before and you know where it got us? A 15-20 mob train in attempt to kill all of us.<br>

Not pull Cazel and run around and around for 20 minutes 2 hours or 987 years untill a party is formed. <br>
<br>
That's the &quot;rule&quot;. But just because it's the &quot;rule&quot; doesn't mean taking it from somoene who's campinf/kiting is ethical. That's subjective. What's ethical to one is not to another. You do at some point have to draw a line on how long your going to kite around something.<br>

Things have changed for us and obviously not you.  Its always someones fault and not obviously never yours?  Lets go back to the thing your guild does not know anything about.  Yes, its about aggro.  We had over 1/2 to 1/3 of 1st floor hate cleared.  My oh my what happens? You guild hop us and your monk ANONYMOUSLY gets maestro aggro.  The mob we were going after.  What does yours truly do something he knows about? Snags that aggro back and brings it back to papa.<br>
<br>
We were already in sro when your recruit asked what we were doing.  There is plenty of room in poh and you know it. Did you see us try to snag grandmaster or anything of the sort? No, our main intention was the enchanter epic piece.<br>
<br>
I was the only one pulling poh for us that night and we weren't LDing out like crazy. I made sure a cleric q'd out away from your mess.  You continually say we tried to make a wipe out.  I was the only one not even in safe camp and you say it was me? Yes, I  would be almost brillant as you are and wipe out the raid. That is so much bs and you know you were just sharing aggro from zone in run to safe camp.<br>
<br>
I loved how your corpse was dead at zone in Trist and you see everything. Take your righteousness out of your ass<br>

<br>
  About Cazel...numbers do matter my friend, and the name of that game is ~mobilization~.  If you cant get the force there to take something, and someone else is there, actively wanting the same thing, its common courtesy to wait...which, from what im hearing from quite a few, we did wait, and still, no force sufficient to take Cazel was present on your part, so, we claimed.  Happens all the time my friend; Doze, WoS, Vessel, Golems in fear, Rumble, SoL, old school Ragefire..the list goes on and on.  Thats the name of the game, and obviously you have no clue how to play it.<br>

<br>
I do know a thing or two about what happened in Hate last night though, and your view of things is pretty skewed at best.  You guys had some crazy chain aggro when we ported up - stuff was running around everywhere and people were getting summoned by the spite golems.  I'm not going to say that I saw you guys training us in safe camp, because i was very busy trying to keep my enchanters alive, but there are a limited number of explanations.  we did not bring more than 2 or 3 mobs to safe camp, the rest came in waves, which is why many of us felt we were being trained over and over.  In the end there were i believe over 25 mobs dead in camp.  If you did not in fact train us, and this was just a result of some crazy chain aggro that was going on in the zone (i think this is a possibility although most did not buy it), then that was very unfortunate.  Coming up to laugh at us and scare us (yes we thought you were going to train us again, we were not scared by your stupid joke) after we had the same chain aggro issues on second floor and had a partial wipe was just in poor taste.  No one jumped, no one laughed, we were just wondering why in the world you were sneaking up behind our raid and hoping not to have our CR trained.<br>
<br>
I really don't want this guild hating shit to start up again, we had enough trouble with that with ADD and I was very relieved when it cooled down.

This is a GAME...I can take a death for a few pixels if it means 10 other people can enjoy the next 20-30 minutes of playtime. You don't know me, and from the looks of your cocksmart elitism, you never will. Regarding the Hate incident, I have NEVER seen such blatant stupidity on your part. We came into safe area along the outsides, and I *PERSONALLY* heard a loathing lich casting stuns, and it was definitely not on me, or anyone around me, because I didnt see any spell effects. I have run circles around Hate on the side wall hundreds of times, pulling corpses from under Inny's nose while dank ass pissheads like you waited at safe camp (or your bind point) for me to bring home the bacon. I believe its safe to say (hard as it is to believe, on your part) that I've zoned into Hate more times than your whole guild has been to their bind points. No offense on your guildies that aren't missing that special chromosome, but if I see all your clerics sitting down to camp and 2 UP members running in from the buildings, I KNOW something is up. <br>
<br>
Granted, we're not the &quot;uber&quot; guild of the server, but that was a damn mighty fine train you guys brought in. And, after most of yours were dead, which, would most possibly mean these things were all aggroed on *blink blink* you guys (for some insane reason, your squad pulled them perhaps?) We took them all. This was no mere train, people at home and reading this board, this was a &quot;Holy Hell&quot; train. There were at LEAST 15 or so mobs, including most all the revs, cleric house, and roamers. This stands to reason someone WANTED all this in camp, for some bizarre reason. But we took em, took em all, and then took more from the screwed ass aggro your dead and camped had left in the buildings. We ended up clearing *most* of the first floor in a total of what, 10 minutes? Tell me then, why the hell would we need to train your gimp butts to get to where we needed?<br>
<br>
What I find even more amusing, to add to the story, is later, on the second floor, which we had promptly moved to and were killing along happily...all of a sudden, here come 15 or so big ass DE NPC's. Yes, we fought the good fight, offed as many as we could, and died, then started the CR process. That's not the strange part. The strange part is the lil' guy standing in a doorway behind us as we're doing all we can to salvage the situation, with a nice little UP tag below his name. Thats all I could see in the short amount of time before I fell. I know it wasnt one of ours, as (for those of you that can read) &quot;Unruled Power&quot; is a quite bit longer than &quot;Radiant&quot;...so, as it stands, I'm thinking it was another of YOUR squad, doing stupid shit. I'll come to where I was resurrected, and while watching people loot their corpses, turned and saw quite a few UP members standing in the doorway, doing nice little childish emotes of giggling and laughing. Yeah UP, I bet you had nothing to do with that, either. <br>
<br>
On a further note, do any of the older players remember way back when the term &quot;cheese breaking&quot; was formed for the planes, where a guild would wait for another guild to clear a bunch of crap, leave, then the waiting guild would run in and secure a camp, having to break nothing? I do. That said, it's really not such a big deal anymore granting the difficulty of the game and the time involved with some areas. But, doing it in Hate just to spite another guild *while* they're in there, is just retarded, plain and simple. We were working towards and I believe IN VIEW of the last mini-boss we wanted to work that night, and all of a sudden, hes gone. Nice cheese break, UP...of course, it wasnt pulled yet, so its not against the rules, but just showing how utterly lame and pathetic you guys truly are. <br>
<br>
Screw Cazel. I don't care about that situation, yeah, I'm part of Radiant, and you guys are part of UP, but watch your pathetic little mouth when you bring me into a situation kiddo, it'll only get you hurt in the end. As the lurkers and old timers here know, I simply don't and won't put up with that kind of crap from a nothing little pissant, especially from the likes of you. Furthermore, you think everyone here and 99% of the Quellious population likes and gets a kick out of Radiant because we train/KS people? Get a clue, man. <br>
<br>
Finally, as you may not know (showing even further the depths of your depravity and utter stupidity) Tristadorn and Maeve live together...hello! Of course he saw it all...are ye daft? Not to mention our guild actually has...*shock* communication! It's a wonderful thing, you guys should try it sometime, seeing as you obviously don't have it now, with your little &quot;Kiting Cazel for a good while&quot; incident. What the hell could be so hard with getting a druid there, having the druid add some damage, then having a melee run behind him and whup on him a while? If you had any clue on game tactics, you'd know this is EASILY done, and requires a couple of people, and is VERY effective. <br>
<br>
Well, I saw something else you've very moronically added. You hope to see Trist at another Ragefire kill rolling on loot. Well, dinky dau, You're obviously too closed minded and simple to see that Radiant doesn't roll on loot. We give our loot based on attitude, respect, and need, and we pass down or guildbank what we aren't using. What the hell does Trist need personally from Ragefire anyway? If it was an open raid I'm willing to bet he was there for SOMEONE ELSE's needs or wants, and using HIS time for SOMEONE ELSE. Which is just about all Trist does these days. Don't ever slander my guild leader and friend, you'll never grow high enough to even touch that man's boots. before I just read that, I was here only to defend myself from your idiocy. You entered a vein where the blood courses fiery and deep red, and now you're going to ride the wave. Get ready kiddo, the fun is just beginning.<br>
<br>
I've seen plenty of tits in my life, but never any tits quite as stupid as you guys. <p><img src=http://www.webspawner.com/users/zodiack/zodiack.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uulwern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulwern</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>F`Salta</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/22/02 12:46:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=534.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good ole Radiant? eh?</span><hr size=1> This will be my final post from the observation of the &quot;Radiant Thinking&quot;  Let me remind you Vaghris, who got your epic.

And you are close to being an old school mob, Ulwern?  jeez man your posts are steadily deteriorating in quality, and they really weren't that great to start with.  Definitely time to call it quits, put your tail between your legs and slink back home. <br>

1) Agro is VERY touchy in that zone. One mob out of control or pathing bad on the port in side of Safe camp can quickly cause an &quot;agro Storm&quot; of 30 plus mobs.<br>
<br>
2) Moving around on floor 2 when floor one is not clear is not a good odea at all, floor one mobs agro through the floor when you engage mobs above them. Learned this one in a painful wipeout.. <p>Raenoir DuShaine<br>

The gang of mobs that wiped us up there were only the big DE mob types, as there was nothing left really in the zone to jump on us anyway. I'm still wondering why there was a lil' UP guy standing behind us watching us wiping, then the childish giggling and laughing afterwards. Reminds me of a childish prank, actually. But that's neither tit nor tat, the poor sap has brought the flame to the message boards, and INTENDED to bring the issue to the boards, then for some strange reason decided to /bow out. I don't bring a gun to a bank if I'm not gonna rob it, I dont pour beer on a guy at a ballgame if I dont intend on whipping his ass, and I don't kidnap babies if I don't intend on eating them. Nuff' said.<br>
<br>
Well, not Nuff' said...if the mobs are running into the portal, whacking people, then running off to whack the original aggro person, then summoning people halfway across the zone (weve all seen this when we were pulling and so forth) then its obviously not the person's fault that just ported in. <p><img src=http://www.webspawner.com/users/zodiack/zodiack.jpg></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uzodiackdaigaero.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zodiack Dai Gaero</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.webspawner.com/users/Zodiack2/z_md_wht.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/22/02 1:30:02 am<br></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font> <br> <br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
