<br>
The morning started as we were heading toward seb to kill trak.  Our guild leader was doing ports on her alt druid ( Pangea ) and checking track in EJ as she made the trips.<br>
<br>
Low and behold, Sev popped and Pangea immediately tracked to sev's feet and sat at the dragons feet and we &quot;called to arms&quot; the guild.<br>
<br>
About 15 minutes later as I was sitting in Seb, I recieved a /tell from Ryohki ( who was sitting next to me ) asking if I was available to MB a mob.  I told here 'no... I dont have MB yet&quot; then ported myself to EJ to help get folks there.<br>
<br>
At this time when I zoned into EJ there was 3 people in the zone... Pangea, Manteca and myself.  and we had others on the way.<br>
<br>
Since the time we started the &quot;call to arms&quot;... in /ooc we stated intent on taking sev.<br>
<br>
As our people started zoning in, Mantica said in /ooc &quot;we'll back off if you get over 20 people here&quot;  and comming from a non wizard we jokingly said back, &quot;aye,we'll back off if YOU get over 20 here first too&quot;<br>
<br>
Our folks continued to arrive... and I notice Karraway, Laughs, azile and ryohki arrived as well.  Seeing this, I sent Karraway a tell and spoke with him, etc.<br>
<br>
At this point we had about 16-18 er so in the zone when all of a sudden Manteca trains our camp ( we have only 2 non-kos to RoS guildies who were there ).  I wasnt at the camp as I was porting people still, but I /who &quot;dark brigade&quot; and saw almost all LD ( dragon fear ) so knew there was a wipeout.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
/tell Karraway, &quot;who the hell is Manteca? she just trained sev and wiped us?&quot;<br>
<br>
Karraway tells you, &quot;I have no idea :/&quot;<br>
<br>
( so i dont think the rest of the burners knew about this )<br>
<br>
****<br>
<br>
At this point we had 3-4 er so in the zone ( our clerics died with the train ).  We did have a necro though so he rezzed our clickstick and we started picking some people back up.  Took us awhile to find some corpses and ended up summoning 2 of them.<br>
<br>
During that time, Ryohki's alt trained a few of us again... stalling us some more as we CR'd those raiders.<br>
<br>
At this time, we moved our camp right to the EJ/TT zone so we could zone if Sev was trained on us some more.  We were buffing people for the third time and almost ready to pull when our ranger couldnt get Sev on track anymore.  We had over 18 in the zone and still more incomming... but 18 is plenty for Sev so we were going to pull before we got trained again.<br>
<br>
Yep, Sev got burned before we could recover from the 2 trains.<br>
<br>
<br>
I sure as hell hope this wasnt just a stall tactic by the MB team to keep us out of the zone.  I don't think that Karraway and the other know who Mantica was though as after the first train Karraway told me he didnt have a clue who it was.<br>
<br>
Either way,  It was an obvious gank.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, Karraway told me that Rhyohki told the rest of the MB team that we had some kind of deal with them that if they were ready to burn before we had 20 in the zone then to go ahead and take him.<br>
<br>
BULLSHIT!<br>
<br>
Hope you all enjoy your loot.<br>

They ooced their intent from the start and they even received a reply from someone on the MB team (so it was obvious they knew the raid was there).  They did all the things the MB wizards in the other thread said to in order to make sure your raid doesn't get run over and it happened anyways.<br>
<br>
Like Palazious said, Karraway, Laughs and Azile are all top notch people who I don't think would purposefully pull crap like this unless they had been misled.  On the other hand you have Ryohki-bay who asked both Palazious and another LC wizard without MB to come help (doesn't seem like it went through normal MB wizard channels if they didn't even know who the MB wizards are).<br>
<br>
Again it sucks that you guys got screwed over by the doings of one fucktard mb wizard and the rest of the MB wizards on the server are gonna take heat for it.<br>

I just find this statement sad.  It is sad that the general consensus among the majority of people these days is to automatically think the worst about a person.  It coulda been a million things, and the only way you would know is if you witnessed it first hand, but still people will automatically think the worst...Guilty before proven innocent.  WoOt.<br>

BULLSHIT. If he/she was backing off, then he/she/it shouldn't have been close enough to Sev to train him. Either that, or they are too stupid to stay away from the dragon (Ebay MB wizard?). It was either intentional which is most likely, or pure stupidity. Either way, it was gimp.<br>

I'm sorry to see people like this give MB wizards a bad name. If MB were to ever get changed in any way, it would be because of these fucktards who haven't got a damn clue.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1965">Tattle</a><br>Quellious<br>

First of all, this is not a flame that reflects on the MB wizards, it is on Ryohki and Manteca. Palazious stated already that he was fairly certain the other wizards knew nothing of it. <br>

Secondly, Palazious doesn't come here flaming for every little thing injustice that happens to our guild. For him to come here and post anything means a great injustice occurred, with no &quot;misunderstandings&quot;. We give people the benefit of the doubt when there is an issue, and in this instance, you can trust Palazious to be accurate on what happened.<br>
<br>
To those in Wraith who would blindly defend someone you admit is an ebayer just lacks in class. Better had you said nothing at all...<br>

Ryohki seems nice to me anyway but seems a bit too MB happy as always asking if a dragon is up and just yesterday logged in around 3 am pst and asked if any dragons were up.. I said no then she said going back to sleep... That seems kinda fishy to me getting up early just to burn something.  It is most likely the others burners were deceived and/or Ryohki misunderstood the other raid or just flat out tried to take them out..<br>
<br>
I would like to know Ryohki's side before any judgement is passed.<br>
<br>
This is a clear cut case of what manaburn can be used to do bad.. Would be nice if people posted the good things manaburns can do but then that wouldnt make a flame board wouldnt it? <p><center>

Hell half the time i don't know who ryohki is being played by.  If someone intentionaly trained anyone, especially for the sake of burning a dragon, that is ridiculous and i hope it is handled sternly.<br>
<br>
I honestly HATE Manaburners.  I play a wizard and i STILL hate manaburn.  There is no use for it, other than burning down the midlevel content for midlevel guilds.  A wizard on a highlevel mob can do more dmg with normal spells than by using manaburn.  <br>
<br>
This kinda bullshit pisses me off, because actions of these few people give all of wraith a bad name.  I dont condone this stuff and neither does our leadership.  I can sit here and tell you this all day, but these ridiculous acts will make it all negated in the long run.<br>
<br>
I, personally, wouldn't put the blame on jama right away.  For one thing that time of day is a time that jama rarely plays in.  Another is these actions aren't indicitive of Jama's personality.  I hope im not going to be made to look like a fool, but oh well...I just hope someone does something about this.<br>
<br>
My previous statement was just related to the general sadness of the statement Salta made.  It seems in EQ or in RL people are ready to hang anyone at first inkling that they might have anything to do with a crime or wrong doing.  I think that is wrong in alot of ways, but somehow has become the norm.<br>
<br>
Anyway...<br>

<br>
An ebayed wizard who didn't go through the normal channels or organizing a MB raid ran over another raid.  Their actions in this instance seemed to indicate that it's the kind of person that didn't really care what they needed to do in order to get the kill.  Palazious on the other hand has no reason to lie about something like this.  I really don't how see how the word of a good upstanding person like Palazious plus the known actions of an ebay wizard combined with the possible actions of said ebay wizard = inkling of supposed wrong.  Seems like a lot more than an inkling to me =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/upalaziousfrydaddy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palazious Frydaddy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/4/02 5:50:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=451.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryohki/Manteca and the Sev gank early sat morning</span><hr size=1> Naa,<br>
<br>
This definately isn't a flame against Wraith and would be kinda hard to somehow put the blame on them.<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
Because a wraith member was sitting in our camp when the first train hit and died along with the rest of the deceased.  He wanted to tank, we figured why the hell not because a few of our members said he was a good friend of theirs.  <br>
<br>
How do we know the train was intentional?<br>
<br>
Because we had 2 non-KoS members following Sev the whole time except for final buffs ( at which time sev was burned ).<br>
<br>
Ryohki told me that Manteca was her alt after the fact.  I do not know or have seen Jama at any time during this.<br>

If Wraith truly cares about their image, and I seriously doubt they do, they need to stop inviting in these fucktards and punish them when they do something wrong.  By keeping that person guilded, it tells the server they agree with their actions.  Any action a person does reflects on their guild, good or bad. <p><TABLE Frame = Box>

I am curious, how do you train a raid 'by mistake' twice, then burn the dragon by accident? Thats a neat trick.<br>
