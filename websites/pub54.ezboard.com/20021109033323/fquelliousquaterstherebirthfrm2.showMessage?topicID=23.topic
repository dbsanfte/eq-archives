<br>
Prologue<br>
<br>
The first thing I remembered was waking up with dirt in my <br>
mouth and a terrible ache all over my body. The next thing I <br>
remembered was a feeling of horrible loss and a loud mourning <br>
keen emanating from my mouth. Sitting up was a challenge all <br>
unto itself. It had been quite some time since I had resided in <br>
a mortal body and while relatively healthy and toned, it felt <br>
like attempting to climb a greased post with my hands tied <br>
behind my back. Regardless, I was eventually able to pull <br>
myself into a sitting position.<br>
<br>
The air was a comfortable degree of chilly. I found myself <br>
clothed haphazardly in a leather and plate mixture of armour. <br>
Several coins had somehow found their way into a pouch at <br>
my belt, and I wondered for a moment just how drunk I had <br>
been the previous night.<br>
<br>
Then it hit me. <br>
<br>
It hit me with the cold precision of a tier’dal sacrificial knife <br>
doing its wrought duty.<br>
<br>
I hadn’t been drunk the previous night. I hadn’t even been <br>
here the previous night. Hells, I wasn’t even alive last night. I <br>
knew with a chilling certainty what would be guarding me <br>
while I reawaked from the dead. Indeed, there she stood, <br>
hovering over me like some sort of lunatic bed-nurse pacing <br>
back and forth over her sick patient. <br>
<br>
The crystal claw: An artifact torn from the first goddess <br>
herself, the goddess of dragons. Veeshan.<br>
<br>
“You sick bastard.” I grunted as I pulled myself to my <br>
knees. “Why have you brought me back?”<br>
<br>
The claw stopped and offered its hilt to my hand.<br>
<br>
“No!” I roared in fury. “Gods no! I have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     done</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> my duty <br>
and I will not be brought back by the likes of you!” My hands <br>
and indeed, my whole body shook with the chill air and the <br>
hard rage boiling within me. “I will no longer be a pawn in this <br>
game, do you hear me?” I yelled at the claw as it bobbed up <br>
and down in the air. “Do you hear me?!” I screamed at the <br>
clear sky.<br>
<br>
Silence.<br>
<br>
I don’t remember how long it was until I moved again, only <br>
that it had become night and much colder. I looked around, <br>
pointedly ignoring the Claw as if it no longer had a hold on <br>
me. <br>
<br>
I stood up, absently brushed the dirt from my tattered <br>
clothing and looked around. I was on Faydwer. The distinct <br>
silvery leaves of the trees rustled quietly in the evening wind <br>
as if in anticipation. I breathed in a great gulp of the sylvan <br>
air and immediately felt refreshed. This was somewhere I <br>
knew, at the very least.<br>
<br>
Rummaging through the baggage and equipment that had <br>
apparently fallen from the firmament with me, I found one <br>
of the compasses made by the gypsies.<br>
<br>
“Where to now?” I muttered under my breath. Checking the <br>
compass I began to trod south (south being a good a <br>
direction as any considering my circumstances), put one foot <br>
in front of the other and let my mind wander.<br>
<br>
What had gone so terribly wrong? Why had I been brought <br>
back? How had I been brought back? Most importantly...<br>
<br>
Who had brought me back?<br>
<br>
I remembered that night… the night I had freed myself. Or <br>
thought I had freed myself. The images came back clearly, <br>
for they were my last mortal memories…<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     Tristan approached the enormous doors of the Temple of <br>
Marr with resolve in his heart. The paladin was no longer <br>
dressed in his sky blue armour of the gods, but instead was <br>
attired like any other gypsy. His sashes fluttered in the light <br>
breeze and tousled his hair into his eyes. The eye patch was <br>
gone. He sighed as the scar on his hand throbbed in response <br>
to the Claw of Veeshan. It knew. It had always known his <br>
thoughts.<br>
<br>
Damn sword.<br>
<br>
The gypsy looked up and blinked as a few raindrops splashed <br>
on his nose and forehead, then looked back down as the Claw <br>
paced restlessly in front of him. <br>
<br>
Thirsty for battle. As always.<br>
<br>
Tristan chuckled mirthlessly. It was his turn finally. His turn to <br>
own his destiny rather then play the pawn. He opened the <br>
doors to the temple slowly making nary a sound as he slipped <br>
inside. The rain tapped gently on the glass ceiling far above. <br>
The paladin made his way soundlessly up the flights of stairs, <br>
his skills in stealth not dulled by his years encased in steel.<br>
<br>
He stood slightly out of breath as he reached the very top of <br>
the temple. A great statue of two lovers entwined in each <br>
other’s arms stood before him. The altar of Erollisi Marr.<br>
<br>
The Claw hummed in response to the divine power that <br>
emanated from the sculpture. Tristan closed his eyes and <br>
drank in the peace and love that seemed to flow outward and <br>
over him. His reverie was broken by a light touch on his <br>
shoulder. The paladin whirled around, grasping for a shield <br>
that wasn't there. He soon relaxed however as his assailant's <br>
eyes moistened with tears.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.&quot; Tristan said hoarsely, his resolve threatening to <br>
flee. &quot;Sumadare, no...&quot;<br>
<br>
The druid stepped closer to him, her cloak rusting against the <br>
smooth marble floor. She smelled of pine and earth and a <br>
rainy breeze.<br>
<br>
&quot;How did you know this was where I would come?&quot; The gypsy <br>
said as he looked into her eyes. She merely cocked an <br>
eyebrow and tilted her head. &quot;Ok... ok, stupid question.&quot; he <br>
smiled lightly and took her hands. &quot;You know this is what I <br>
have to do. What I've always had to do.&quot; She nodded and <br>
wrapped her arms around him, clutching him fiercely as if her <br>
will alone would keep him there. Tristan stroked her hair and a <br>
tear streaked down his cheek onto her rough spun cloak. <br>
After a few moments he stepped back and looked into her <br>
eyes again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Here.&quot; he spoke, removing a ring from his finger that looked <br>
the exact replica of the statue behind him. &quot;This will give you <br>
the power to call me back should you ever need me. But we <br>
both know you won't.&quot; He smiled. Sumadare took the ring <br>
hesitantly and the gypsy put it on her right forefinger and <br>
kissed her hand.<br>
<br>
Tristan turned his back to her, sneered at the Claw and <br>
gripped its hilt tightly. The usual thrill of battle excitement <br>
shot through him, induced by the weapon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Step back.&quot; the paladin said hollowly. Sumadare took a <br>
bewildered step back as Tristan began to chant. Quietly at <br>
first, but advancing in cadence and volume as he rose his <br>
arms into the air. The chants spoke of Erollisi and Mithaniel <br>
Marr. Prayers Sumadare had never heard uttered by any <br>
priest or paladin.<br>
<br>
Prayers of challenge to his goddess.<br>
<br>
The statue of the lovers began to glow with a light pink aura <br>
and Tristan ceased his call of challenge. He raised the Claw of <br>
Veeshan, which was now shooting forth blue light, with both <br>
hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;For Honour!&quot; the paladin yelled bringing the Claw smashing <br>
down upon the statue. There was a deafening crack as the <br>
blade split halfway up the middle. Sumadare stumbled back <br>
from the explosion and gripped the stair banister. Tendrils of <br>
pink light began to reach out from the undamaged statue <br>
toward the gypsy. He raised the blade again.<br>
<br>
&quot;For Selflessness!&quot; the blade sparked and spat lightning as it <br>
connected again with the sculpture, leaving the altar <br>
unharmed but the sword the worse for wear. The pink light <br>
turned violet and intensified. Tristan pursed his lips and raised <br>
the Claw wearily above his head.<br>
<br>
&quot;For Truth!&quot; he jammed the tip of the weapon between the <br>
lovers and fell back as a white fireball slammed into his chest. <br>
Sumadare shielded her eyes from the light and began to crawl <br>
toward him.<br>
<br>
&quot;NO!&quot; Tristan yelled and pulled himself to his feet, his skin <br>
charred and blackened. He stumbled toward the statue now <br>
buzzing with bright violet energy, the Claw's light dull in <br>
comparison. Tristan grit his teeth and gripped the hilt with <br>
both hands and was rewarded with a violent shock.<br>
<br>
It was rejecting him.<br>
<br>
But he held on. &quot;Oh no my little pretty. We're not quite <br>
finished yet.&quot; he snarled. The light around him grew brighter <br>
still until the entire room was a divine light to his eyes. <br>
Warmth washed over him then and a soft hand slipped around <br>
his.<br>
<br>
Let go, the hand seemed to say. Let go of this mortal coil. <br>
There is nothing here for you anymore. I need you now. I <br>
need your strength. <br>
<br>
Tristan felt nothing but love. Sweet, unconditional love. His <br>
heart beat faster as he realized he was close. He nodded his <br>
head and smiled in acquiesance.<br>
<br>
The paladin came back to the world as a shock of pain rent <br>
his body.<br>
<br>
&quot;Trist!&quot; a voice screamed somewhere behind him. &quot;Trist! Don't <br>
do this!&quot; Tristan turned slowly and looked down. Sumadare <br>
was on her knees, her cloak gathered around her protectively, <br>
tears streaming down her cheeks, one hand reaching out.<br>
<br>
Tristan smiled serenely and turned back to the altar. With a <br>
quick jerk of the wrist, he snapped the blade in half within the <br>
statue. &quot;For Love.&quot; he whispered. The buzzing increased to a <br>
horrid keening, then suddenly fell silent.<br>
<br>
Sumadare looked up shielding her eyes from the light. The <br>
form of Tristadorn was placing his hand in that of a woman <br>
that could only be described as beautiful in the divine. He <br>
smiled and looked back and his lips formed words at the druid. <br>
He then turned away and walked into the light laughing <br>
silently.<br>
<br>
After several moments the light died out and the altar <br>
appeared unscathed. Sumadare stood slowly, her legs shaking <br>
slightly, and made her way to the statue. She placed her <br>
fingers on the lovers' lips wonderingly and smiled. <br>
<br>
&quot;I will always love you, my friend,” he had said.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
“Sumadare… my friend.” I had stopped walking, and by the <br>
look of the brightening sky to the east, I had been walking for <br>
quite some time. <br>
<br>
“The ring. Was it you? Was it the ring that brought me back? <br>
But <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     why</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?”<br>
<br>
The Claw continued to gleam with its unnatural light, and I <br>
could swear it was smiling at me. If swords can smile. <br>
<br>
Examining my surroundings I noticed that I had drifted into <br>
the outlands of the sylvan elves; the wood elves as the <br>
fier’dal call them. I was barely a day’s walk from her, <br>
Sumadare’s, dwelling. It had to be her! But why? Why? The <br>
question throbbed in my head like the pounding of a dwarven <br>
smithy.<br>
<br>
Why…why…why…<br>
<br>
Sumadare had known the peace I’d found with Erollisi’s touch. <br>
Why bring me back into this chaos-driven realm. Unless… <br>
unless something terrible had befallen her. At this thought, my <br>
eyes grew wide and a wave of sickness overtook me, nearly <br>
overwhelming my sense. The Claw bobbed and gleamed with <br>
mirth as I gripped a low hanging branch to steady myself.<br>
<br>
“Sumadare!”<br>
       <br>
I stumbled forward at a sickly trot.<br>
<br>
“Sumadare!” I nearly began to wretch as another wave of <br>
nausea hit me. No! What was happening to me? I had to get <br>
to her. Had to make sure she was all right. Only then could I <br>
sink back into the sweet oblivion I craved.<br>
<br>
“Sumadare…” I whispered as my knees hit the <br>
ground. “Erollisi… give me strength. I let your love flow into<br>
me. Heal me…”<br>
<br>
It was with that uttered prayer that I blacked out.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Dawnlight streamed in the den window as Solusek’s first <br>
gentle rays graced the treetops of the sylvan forest. The <br>
resident of the abode was already awake, humming lightly to <br>
herself as she knelt stirring the dying embers in her fireplace <br>
stove. She smiled and closed her eyes as the light hit her <br>
face, tilting her head back and enjoying the warmth.<br>
<br>
Ah, it is so good to be home, she thought to herself.<br>
<br>
She stood, brushed the dirt from her leather breaches and <br>
looked around. Her house had been an absolute mess by the <br>
time she had come back. Books had been strewn all over the <br>
den, the pantry had been ransacked, and her bedding torn to <br>
shreds. She hadn’t been angry though. She’d known exactly <br>
who the culprit had been.<br>
<br>
The house itself wasn’t actually a house, but a gigantic oak <br>
tree hollowed out on the inside. Still living, the massive oak <br>
had been lovingly shaped and grew around and with the <br>
occupant inside it in a rare symbiotic state.<br>
<br>
The occupant herself was a rare one. The offspring of a <br>
human female and elven father, she had the best traits of <br>
both races. Auburn hair framed a face that had once been <br>
delicate, but gently hardened over time with the wisdom of <br>
many trials. Gentle and compassionate as the sylvan, quick as <br>
a human to take action when needed. She was clad in the <br>
loose fitting leather leggings of someone used to the <br>
outdoors, and wore a rough spun cloak that was tattered <br>
around the edges.<br>
<br>
The half elf stood musing over the fire when she heard a <br>
rustling from the kitchen area. She smirked and crept silently <br>
toward the pantry.<br>
<br>
“Ah HAH!” She cried as she threw open the wicker door to the <br>
pantry, startling a wide-eyed, black and white lump of fur. <br>
The lump began to skitter away in haste not unlike a child <br>
being caught in some wrongdoing.<br>
<br>
“Oh no you don’t you little thief.” The druid laughed and <br>
grabbed the ball of fur by the scruff of the neck. She brought <br>
the lump to her face and almost burst out laughing from the <br>
contrite look in the eyes staring back at her. “So, had a little <br>
bit of fun while I was gone did you, Pitpik? Well, now I know <br>
who was responsible for the mess in here while I was away.” <br>
She gently laid the furry ball on the floor and scratched it <br>
behind an ear. “Silly badger, if you were hungry all you had to <br>
do was ask.” At the tone of the woman’s voice the lump <br>
uncurled itself and stretched, knowing all was forgiven. The <br>
badger rolled onto its back and exposed its white stomach for <br>
the attention it knew it would get. The druid obliged and fed <br>
it a piece of dried pua fruit.<br>
<br>
“Next time, I’m taking you with me.” She poked the badger <br>
playfully. Pitpik made no response except to chew on its bit of <br>
fruit complacently. The druid smirked and stood up and <br>
stretched luxuriously. She was about to turn to the badger to <br>
lecture it on the proper courtesy when dealing with other <br>
persons’ beddings when her words died on her lips.<br>
<br>
She stood frozen, staring out the window of her house, all <br>
blood drained from her cheeks.<br>
<br>
A man… or a ghost… was stumbling toward her door.<br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
Sumadare made a dash for the door, stopping only long <br>
enough to grab her long gnarled staff, and threw the door <br>
open. The man stopped ten paces from her and stretched out <br>
his hand.<br>
<br>
“Help me…” he croaked and fell to his knees.<br>
<br>
Sumadare backed away in horror. “You… you’re <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     dead</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.”<br>
<br>
The man’s dull eyes stared out of a sweat sheened face with <br>
a glimmer of recognition.<br>
<br>
“Sumadare? Suma… help me. Sick…” he whispered, then <br>
collapsed into a heap.<br>
<br>
The half elf stood in her doorway, stricken.<br>
<br>
No. No, he’s dead. I saw him go. This is not him. It cannot be <br>
him, she thought as she twisted the ring on her right <br>
forefinger.<br>
<br>
The man didn’t move and eventually Sumadare regained her <br>
senses.<br>
<br>
Whoever he is, I should bring him inside and help him. And <br>
with this thought, the druid strode hesitantly out the door. As <br>
she approached, a gleam of light off crystal caught her eye. <br>
She froze once again in terror.<br>
<br>
“You!” she cried, backing away from the Claw. “You did this <br>
to him didn’t you. You brought him back.” The sword began <br>
floating back and forth in the air in front of the man. <br>
Sumadare frowned, tears in her eyes.<br>
<br>
She stepped forward toward the man’s body and the Claw <br>
stopped, facing her threateningly.<br>
<br>
“I’m going to help him, damn you! Get back, or by all the gods <br>
I will destroy you myself!” Sumadare knew the threat to be <br>
hollow. If a goddess herself couldn’t destroy the blade, she <br>
surely couldn’t. But the Claw seemed to understand as it <br>
swung about imperiously, allowing her to approach. The druid <br>
scowled, but as she approached tears softened her eyes.<br>
<br>
Kneeling beside him, she turned him over onto his back and <br>
choked back a sob. <br>
<br>
It was him.<br>
<br>
The trimmed beard, the long golden blonde hair, the sensual <br>
lips, pursed in seeming thought even while unconscious. It <br>
was him.<br>
<br>
Sumadare gathered him to her and held him fiercely, sobbing.<br>
<br>
“Oh Trist… what have they done to you.” <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/upunkassgypsy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punkass Gypsy</A> at: 2/8/02 12:16:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uradjan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Radjan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(2/8/02 11:45:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Erollisi Lost</span><hr size=1> D -<br>
