<br>
Last Thursday night, members of Council of Arcana killed the boss mob in EK, winning me an Idol of the Wayward Spirit (10ac 9wis 25mana, etc). I arrived at the mob after an LD, and Runicmyst was kneeling the corpse for me. When he released it, I couldn't loot it because Gauron had kneeled the corpse (craftily in wolf form so no one would notice). Then Borran of Inverted Horizons looted the corpse, completely screwing me out of my Idol.<br>
<br>
When the guides talked to him, he didn't deny ninjaing the item, because &quot;Gauron said he could loot it&quot;. What kind of BS is that? There were a bunch of people around telling them it was for me, and despite that, he took it anyways. <br>
<br>
So anyways, last night, I talked to the GM, and he made Borran destroy it, but wouldn't give it to me because he considered it an accident.<br>
<br>
I feel completely ripped off by this guy who cheated me out of an item that I will not likely see the quality of for a long, long time. I want to know where these folks get off ripping off other players. <br>
<br>
I don't want to pull Inverted Horizons in to this too far, because from what I'm told, they're honorable people, but really, they need to do something about this SOB.<br>

He was running a Vox raid just before mine got underway. He was the one who refused to join forces and roll for the book if it dropped. The really sad part is, he either is an IDIOT or he has no qualms with sending 20 people to deaths and long CR's. Hell one chanter died 8 times because of his selfishness. If you're going to lead something like that then you better have the balls to be responsible for the lives of the 40 people who entrust you to make sure they win (and if you only have 20 people you know damn well you aint gonna win).<br>
<br>
I think that alone spoke for Gauron's character and im sure he told Borron it was ok to loot the item. <p>     Ravenark <BR>

 I wasn't there.  There are always 2 sides to every story and this is the first I've heard of it.  Why would you post something like this here and not go directly to our message board? <br>
<br>
 One thing I would like to say is Gauron has always been an honest and loyal friend. He is very paladin like and I would really doubt that he would (purposfully) cheat anyone out of anything.<br>
<br>
 Secondly ... this is right off our charter page everyone has access to.<br>

<br>
 &quot;Aside from the level restriction, the only other requirement is that you have a good reputation with your fellow Norrathians.  If you are know as a &quot;ninja looter&quot;.....&quot;kill stealer&quot;.....&quot;hacker&quot;.....&quot;duper&quot;.....or any other colorful adjective deemed inappropriate by fellow players or Verant/Sony, your application will not be considered.&quot;<br>
<br>
...................................................................................<br>
<br>
 I'm sorry if you feel you were cheated. Inverted Horizon's doesn't condone ninja looting. I hope this was a misunderstanding.<br>
 <br>
 I think you would get a better response from the people involved though if you posted at:   www.invertedhorizons.com<br>

Anyhow, most of the matter is out of IH's hands as Borran's not guilded there anymore, whether he was kicked out or just left I don't know. <br>
<br>
There was no misunderstanding Kinderfeld. People were all around /saying &quot;It belongs to Lor&quot;, and &quot;Please release the corpse&quot; after Runicmyst released it. Borran told the Guide and the GM that Gauron said it was OK to loot it. I'd actually like to hear Gauron's side of the story. I didn't even know he was involved until the Guide told me that was Borran's story. I did see him at the scene though. <br>
<br>
Regardless of what happened, this is an example of disgusting conduct by members of your guild. They were told who the item was being defaulted to, but since the quality of loot was so high, they decided that they would ninja it. I know this is an isolated event, and definitely not representative of your guild, or even the members involved, but the damage was done. The simple fact remains that I was cheated through one means or another. <p>---<BR>

<br>
Here is my story about it.<br>
We get there and saw the dead mob without anyone holding it .. i checked it (looked at corpse and i wasnt wolfform .. dunno why ya lieing). Said only to Borran that there is still a Priest idol (never said to loot it). then i said him to check the corpse and see teh stats cause there was nobody who seamed to care about it ( ther wasnt anyone telling anything about YOU). He looked at the corpse and the next i saw was the loot massage .......<br>
<br>
So is there anything I did wrong ???? I would say nope<br>
So dont blame me about it and next time plz send a tell to ME first before writing such things.<br>
<br>
To Ravenarks story about VOX raid .... its true that we got a big wipeout and a chanter (sorry forgotname) died 8 times but this was only cause it was my first VOX raid ever and i had to lead it. I didnt know that there are still mobs (giants) near VOX cave and aggroed them accidently after i told the caster to bind in Buffhall. And Ravenark we had more then 20 .... something like 33 if i remember right.<br>
I offered YOU to join us cause i knew that we will have problems inside ... ya refused cause ya knew that the book was defaulted to MY guild (not to me - i was planing to roll with all the guildpallys but they said i can have it)<br>
Maybe we wouldnt get such a wipeout if ya wouldnt had always send me tells that if i dont start in the next 30 min that ya will get your friends and start to raid her yourself. it wasnt fair of ya to make me nervous like that on my first VOX raid ... on my first raid i ever lead ... I dont want to say YOU are the reason we failed but you are a small part of it because i didnt had the time to let all Buff up (cause i was scared that you willl be first rdy to kill her then me and that you take her off without letting me try it) again after we survived the wipeout with the giants. If ya want to say i am a lier ... my Guildleader was on this raid and i talked with him all the time. So plz if ya try to dis someone go search for someone else .....<br>

Gauron Dragonknight<br>
<br>
PS: there are many people on this server who know that i would never KS, Ninjaloot or do something like this . Only people who dont like me or dont know are trying to make me look like one. <br>
But guys i really dont care that ya all trying to dis me .. i posted my version of the stories and now believe it or not ... <br>
I Have many friends out there who know how i am and who i am  and i really dont need to care about what some people *points at Ravenark* are talkin about me...<br>
<br>
So have fun and enjoy the game .....<br>
<br>
If ya have questions or want to to talk with me about something then send me a tell in game or let someone in my guild know and i will send you a tell. I hope this cleared out the situation Natalis.<br>

I think that's pretty clear. Borran told the Guide that you said it was OK, but what you said seems pretty plausible. Runicmyst was holding down the corpse, and I was frantically right-clicking it, getting the &quot;someone else is looting the corpse&quot; message, even after Runicmyst released the corpse (I saw him stand up). You might have just gotten a lucky right-click in or something. People were shouting stuff for quite a while (you had kneeled the corpse for around 30 sec), when you released it and Borran looted it.<br>
<br>
I'm not holding you entirely responsible for this, but you aren't exactly blameless in the matter. It just seems that a large number of things had to go wrong for me to have lost that idol. Borran even admitted what he had done, and the GM made him destroy it. He knew what he did was wrong. Had you not held down the corpse for him to loot, or at least had listened to the people around, this wouldn't have been an issue. <p>---<BR>
