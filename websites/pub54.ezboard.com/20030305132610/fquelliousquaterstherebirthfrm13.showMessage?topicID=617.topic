<br>
Swearing is one thing to moderate, but thats getting a bit anal. I think most people have the capacity to turn away from reading a spoiler if they really don't want to know. No need to play momndad. =) <p><a href="http://www.theradiant.net">

<br>
btw for being &quot;on safehouse&quot; its only today that its really emerging that all the quest there will get you valor and storm not just the easy one.  that particular spoiler was on the backside of a mostly unrelated thread.<br>
<br>
*this next paragraph only in reference to saltas post that it spoils the game*<br>
as for the &quot;spirit of the game&quot;  99.9% of the people i know have used/ do use/ get walk throughs from guildees. very very few people actually do the leg work on a quest without getting help.  Spoiled by tells spoiled by post whats the difference?  Who here got through the skyshrine maze without a map/guide/tells. <br>
<br>
*this next paragraph only in reference to spoiling the game not the rightness of removing it from qc*<br>
What you might mean is that LC already did the leg work on figuring out how to get there Salta?  So i guess the difference might be that you see a guild as a team and any note sharing in that sense isnt ruining the game.  Fine.  Your ok cause you only get it spoiled for you by guildees but someone else is getting it ruined for them by getting it spoiled from a web page?  Or let me ask you this is this same spoiler that you cut on a private LC board already?  prolly.  So it spoils the game on QC but doesnt spoil the game on LC board?  hows that work?  A boards a board a board.  Or did you tear it down from the LC board too?<br>
<br>
*this paragraph in regards to QC moderation*<br>
As for QC i can see how it could be called clutter or its just not QC style.  so fair enough. <br>

<br>
I agree with removing the post. It was a direct spoiler and not really something that I think belongs here. However, I do like the idea of discussing certain new areas/tactics.<br>
<br>
I think, the best way to have our cake and eat it too, is to not copy/paste spoiler info. If you wish to link to it, please feel free to.<br>
<br>
There are several reasons for this. One, some poeple don't like their hard work published. Two, it's a rule not many know about, but SoE has prohibited Guides from being affiliated or even associating with sites that contain spoiler information. Now, as far as I know, none of the mods or admins including myself are or ever have been employed with or voluntered for SoE. Still, I would hate to find out about someone being axed as a guide because they frequent these boards or the main site (under construction). <br>
<br>
As always, we do things based mainly on majority public opinion.

It contains spoilers and always has. If trade people want to buy and sell clearly thats can be covered in the buy/sell area. Sorry Rave but that thing about guides and spoiler sites simply isnt true - if your a guide you cant tell anyone your a guide in the first place, so that excuse is weak at best. Verant also doesnt go looking around the internet for spoiler sites and trying to figure out if any guides or gms ever post/or read those sites. If they did sites like Graffe's, EQTS and the Safehouse all would have been busted a long time ago. <br>
 Personnally I dont care one way or another about the spoiler being posted, but the excuses enumerated by you are weak at best and hypocritical at worst.<br>
<br>
This site has *always* had plenty of spoiler information on it - ranging from the many discussions about changes to Ragefire, to where things drop - how to kill certain mobs and where good exp is and many other topics. Basically to suddenly pretend that spoilers are somehow not allowed (setting aside the glaring example of the Tricks of the Trade section breaking this rule) simply flys in the face of history and reality.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I am wrong but the only logical reason I can think of for deleting that post, especially without even giving a reason till called on it, is that some people feel that maybe the competition level might rise int 'their' raiding area and thats just an ego problem. Again maybe I am wrong here, but that seems to be the case, and its really petty and disheartening, especially when the information is available elsewhere.<br>
<br>
 The volume of messages on the main board (and even in the flame section lately) has dropped off considerably. So its not like that post was hurting anyone. To me this is clearly an ego issue.<br>

done. youll note i quoted the original spoiler.  and left the original authors name in that quote.  a link would have been better.  i thought after words why not just like it but the cut was there.  and again i posted it cause of all the crap on safehouse i thought it was very concise.  concise is good with so many &quot;hail dumps.&quot;  concise is pure spoiler which is the point.  concise is what even now is being collected on guild boards all over QC.  concise is hard to improve upon so not like it would be dated by a better version.  i was just helping the more casual level 60s and starting a discussion.  atleast thats what i thought. i felt able to do so because nothing related to that post was conveyed to me in privaledge as alot of the stuff i know is.  my experience was in pick up groups/picking through boards.  though i think the rarest piece of info there was not the fight itself but the hail before the fight.<br>
<br>
also bout &quot;epic spoilers&quot; versus this unlocking the 2nd tier planes in the week old expansion.  clearly one is more timely.  the complaint was that it wasnt timely enough.  but i think that it was clearly timely enough as lots still didnt know that werent in top tier guilds.  and i wonder if that wasnt the issue?<br>

So the whole guide affiliation issue is a joke because you can be affiliated with any site officially as a guide, and also since this site has does and presumably always will always have various amounts of spoiler information on it anyway.<br>
I noticed you ignored your blatent hypocrisy in your reply by ignoring the fact that spoiler info has always been here and it has *never* been an issue till now - address the point please and stop making up excuses thanks.<br>

What if someone wanted to post spoiler on epics etc.? What is the huge inconvenience about lifting your index finger and pushing the scroll on your mouse? Who gets to decide what's good enough to stay up and what &quot;old news&quot; should come down? No one, I hope. Not even the mods. Threads regulate themselves by interest. If no one cares it'll be at the bottom of the page within the week. (Zek idiots need not apply.)<br>
<br>
As for new spoilers and the &quot;spirit of the game&quot; bunk, you're not exactly willing to follow that ideal if you can't turn your eyes away from a four paragraph post.<br>
<br>
Is QC getting big enough to regulate non-offensive posts? This is scary.<br>

Next topic - trade skill spoilers are still spoilers get it through your head - this should be obvious to everyone.<br>
<br>
Lastly - we have had *many* discussions collectively about moderation in the past, this board has always had many spoilers of many types and to many degrees. Its only now in your colossal arrogance that you try to pretend otherwise. Its only now that you guys destroy a thread and don't even give a reason for it - then when asked make up totally bs excuses and blatantly lie about the facts. Grats hope it makes you feel good - no wonder you have to sticky a &quot;beg for money&quot; thread at the top of most of the pages.<br>

No wait lie and make up stuff some more - Yes I realize you prefaced your remark about guides as to why you didnt allow this particular spoiler and let the last 2987352345983247598342 other spoilers here through. Doesnt change the fact that is was this 'little known rule' that suddenly made you agree with this sudden shift in policy - grats you on not standing behind your own words and lack of comprehension of your own words. Please go drink some more it may become clear. Sure I could have spelled it out for you with long 'faithkills' style quotes, but your probably to drunk to get it either way. But what they hell lets do it anyway:<br>
<br>
Reasons given for why the thread was removed:<br>
<br>
Case A by Salta:<br>
--<br>
Cuz this isn't the safehouse. The mods/admins are discussing whether or not we want to open up the boards for spoiler information. In my personal opinion it ruins the spirit of the game but we'll post the official QC stance on it once we've talked it over. <br>
--<br>
<br>
Salta clearly says here that there is a debate over &quot;whether or not we want to open up the boards for spoiler information..&quot; - this means in the past there was a rule or policy in place that dissallowed such posts.<br>
<br>
Case B by Rave<br>
--<br>
There are several reasons for this. One, some poeple don't like their hard work published. Two, it's a rule not many know about, but SoE has prohibited Guides from being affiliated or even associating with sites that contain spoiler information. Now, as far as I know, none of the mods or admins including myself are or ever have been employed with or voluntered for SoE. Still, I would hate to find out about someone being axed as a guide because they frequent these boards or the main site (under construction). <br>
--<br>
<br>
This paragraph is amusing on three levels - first off - it says there is a little known rule about spoiler sites that must be enforced and thats why he agrees with the post being removed. This is different from what Salta said. Salta made the pure case that spoilers were never allowed here - which is blatently false. The other two amusing things about this paragraph is that Rave says there are several reasons and then only gives one really - that hard work published thing doesnt seem to relate to the topic at hand since Salta obviously wasnt the one being quoted by the original poster. This is still only two reasons and not several in any case. I can only assume he was to drunk to notice. Lastly this whole point is made up because this has never been enforced ever in the history of Everquest, and in point of fact spoiler sites like EQTS and the Safehouse have close ties with verant.<br>
<br>
Lastly we have Case C - Rave tells the truth.<br>
--<br>
The whole Idea of no spoilers frankly never came up until now. Hell, I for one really don't see a problem with them. Salta made the decision to remove it on his own. <br>
--<br>
<br>
ok so here we have truth - there was NEVER a rule all the reasons given were either white lies or just plain old bs. There has never been a policy here about spoilers, and this 'little known rule' was never enforced before.<br>
<br>
 Bottom line is - who lied? Which version is truth? Decide for youself I suppose.<br>
<br>
edit -- Raalf your probably right - sorry I just get really tired of two faced people.<br>

Spoiler or  No-spoiler posts  that is the question....<br>
<br>
I have seen numerious posts here that WERE spoiler posts and those posts were never removed.  Sorry folks but a spoiler is a spoiler is a spoiler.  Regardless of whether the topic is  tradeskill, how to  kill orc_pawn_01 in East Commons,<br>
 how to get from point A to point B or how to do a quest...<br>
<br>
As to why the post was removed?  Hell we  have been given different answers from all the admin ppl..  <br>
<br>
If i was a supicious person i would  say  Salta took it down to slow down competition, except for the fact that anyone seriously into mining  Pop for all the  phat lewts or secrets is already hitting every website, that has every covered EQ in quest/walkthrus, etc..<br>
<br>
So removing the post won't really change how many ppl get to 2nd tier planes....Instead it upsets the folks whom thought we were free to post almost anything here as long as we put it in the approprate category...<br>
<br>
Either way, it's time to ask some hard questions and collectively decide what is acceptable here and whats not.<br>
