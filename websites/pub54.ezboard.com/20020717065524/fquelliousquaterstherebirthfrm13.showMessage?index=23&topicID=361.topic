All quotes Varro's.<br>
<br>
&quot;No one is taking away your right to say a single thing. All this decision does is allow those who do not believe to be included in taking the pledge.&quot;<br>
<br>
Where did they take a kid's right to remain silent (no pun intended) in this entire ordeal? This ruling could open the lawsuit floodgates. An atheist’s rights are violated for the mere mention of a word? Can I sue Bush for liberally sprinkling his speeches with God? Non/Religious tolerance is a two way street, to include atheists.<br>
<br>
When I *do* hear of a kid being kicked out of school or sent to the corner for refusing to say the pledge with his peers I'll take this matter more seriously. Even then it should be handled locally, and if it isn't it can gain momentum. But a new incident shouldn't sweep the nation in contempt overnight.<br>
<br>
&quot;All day I've heard congressmen and others talking about the consensus of opinion in this issue [snip]&quot;<br>
<br>
It's called majority rule. That's how officials are elected. That's why Petco stops shelving cat food with a brand that doesn't make money for another that may and your pet is s hit out of luck, but the company will remain. I'm all for everyone's opinions/issues to be heard, but god damn, some side has to give.<br>
<br>
&quot;100 years from now, maybe 200, our descendants will look upon this decision as the correct one, and whatever backlash comes against it today will be looked upon with sadness.&quot;<br>
<br>
You want to know what's really sad? The lack of foresight on your part to see a domino effect in political life. This ruling isn’t going to silence fundamentalists. It is extreme and baseless bumps in American politics like this one that recharges the GOP and like-minded supporters. It’s a great opportunity for Republicans behind on approval ratings to pound a podium, tuck a Bible under their arm, and sing the national anthem to cheers of voters that want their newfound patriotism reflected in laws rooted in religion I can’t stomach, like chipping away at Roe v. Wade. No doubt this father’s ego swelled. But who the f uck cares for consequences in the immediate future? By your suggestion, it’s right to inconvenience greater society--yeah, go ahead and claim that I mean to say you are “less than great”--on behalf of the minority.<br>
<br>
“Under God” doesn’t rank up there in importance to murder and theft, a basic infringement on a good life that different peoples from different places can come to an agreement on. It’s trivial. It’s a relic. It can be compared to bylaws and rule of thumbs in state ordinances reaching back to the beginning of the last century that are so insipid, so fundamentally stupid no one bothers to recognize the flaw of their congressional predecessors, let alone lift a finger to take them off the books.<br>
<br>
“Leaving 'God' everywhere in government suggests that 'Americans believe in God'…”<br>
<br>
Is this false?<br>
<br>
“…and being that I don't it must mean that I'm not a ‘true’ American.”<br>
<br>
Hard-line racists and similar dregs aside, Eleanor Roosevelt once said, No one can insult me without my permission.<br>
<br>
“School children are very impressionable and while they are not forced to pledge allegiance, they are forced to make a political statement if they choose not to speak.”<br>
<br>
If you were anything like the kids in my school you didn’t give a monkey dick about the morning ritual. Your thoughts were on the straw inside your desk and rolling the ball of paper, ready for wetting, in your free hand as you barely managed to conjure the words in your head for the pledge.  <p>______________________<p>
