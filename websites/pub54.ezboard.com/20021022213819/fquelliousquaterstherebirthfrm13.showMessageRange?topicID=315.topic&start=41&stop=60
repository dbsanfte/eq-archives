Why are the parents being blamed for these things?? Where the heck are the teachers when this stuff happens? We leave our children in the care of the public school system to be taught by these 'teachers' and this is what happens. Then to top it off, we parents get blamed for what happens when our children are not even in our care. We can teach our kids right from wrong and they can be well behaved when they are with us, but when they go off to school or to a friends house or anywhere that we leave that child in the care of another adult, it is now their responsibility to make sure everyone is safe.<br>
<br>
Here is my story:<br>
<br>
Late in the afternoon about a month or so ago I got a call from my sons (a 7 yo first grader) school. They told me that I needed to pick up my son right away. He was being suspending for having a knife at school and the situation was being brought to the attention of the school board for further punishment. Possibly expulsion.<br>
<br>
I sat in my office in complete shock. Where in the heck did he get this knife?!? I do not have any weapons of any kind in my home. Knifes, guns any of that stuff scares me.<br>
<br>
I got to the school and my son was in tears. He was so embarrassed and so upset. Another student had given him this knife and the office staff at the school did not believe him. The little girl (a 7 yo first grader also) who gave it to him said it wasn't hers. I was not satisfyied with that.<br>
<br>
After asking the girl again with me standing right there giving her the death look, she admitted to bringing it to school. She had taken it from her parents bedroom.<br>
<br>
Still, the school wanted to suspend my child. In no way was I about to let my 7 yo son be suspended and miss a day of learning. Being at school everyday is very important to me. Besides, the way the school handled it was punishment enough for both kids.<br>
<br>
I went back and forth with this Principal, asking her where the teachers were when this exchange happened. Are these teachers so overwhelmed in their classrooms to realize what is going on around them? Are they too underpaid to give a damn about the childrens safety? (There were alot of things said, but I don't have time to get into all of that, the end of the day is here!)<br>
<br>
Soon after our conversation began to get heated the little girls father showed up. He and I both thought that neither of the children should be suspended from school. Obviously, these are 7 yo kids who are still learning right from wrong. Each child should be punished but taking their education away is not the kind of punishment they needed and I wasn't about to let that happen.<br>
<br>
We made such a big stink about it and I wouldn't leave until I got my way (stubborn) that she finally gave in. Neither one of the students were suspended and I went home mentally worn out. (I logged onto EQ and killed some orcs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
When my son and I got home I made him write an apology letter to his teacher. But in all honesty, the teacher should be writting an apology letter to us for not being attentive. Someone could have really gotten hurt and I blame the school for having ignorant teachers.<br>

Remember... Those who can't, teach. Those who can't teach, teach PE.<br>
<br>
P.S. Voilence caused by your children IS your fault.  Teachers are not there to teach your children morality, that's your job.  The teachers job is to teach them how to read, and count, NOT how to be a useful member of society.  Saying that what your child does while not under your direction supervision is not your fault, is a cop-out.  Jeez, take some responsibility in your life.<br>
<br>
If your 8 year-old son sneaks into your room while you are busy raiding HoT and takes your gun into your backyard and shoot the nextdoor neighbor, it's YOUR FAULT!  Grow a backbone.<br>

she said it was aggressive.  aggressiveness isnt wrong.  i pity the day that it becomes wrong. is this that day?<br>
<br>
she said it was violent.  it wasnt violent.  what the hell is violent bout playing cowboys and indians.  violent is NOT pointing your finger at someone and making a noise.  violent IS lowering your shoulder pads and trying to flatten the next kid into the turf.  yet the latter is standard after school development and the former is suspension?  football is violent. im not saying it isnt good. im just saying its fricken violent.<br>
<br>
whats next suspension for assault via two for flinching.  <br>
<br>
these activities dont have much to do with what they represent.  i mean cause those &quot;boys&quot; dont want to play with that &quot;girl&quot; are you going to suspend them for their clearly sexiest behavior.  YOU see the world in sexes.  YOU see the cowboys and indian as violent.  but the kids see neither.  its development. their minds are simplier.  stop complicated their damn world.  <br>
<br>
now the kid who got in trouble is being forced to see this play from an adults perspective.  thats never right.  thats sooo wrong.  i mean moving kids to maturity is fine by radical events that force kids to deal with adult points of view come out bad.  they arnt ready.  <br>
<br>
but thats what you have now. why do you think the kid was tearing?  cause now he has to deal with this whole new level of complexity befure the kid was ready.<br>
<br>
so wrong. so naive.  i mean clearly this teacher wouldnt show violent films to the students. yet she has just the same projected a violent context for the student to now understand.  . its just as bad.<br>

No one or two-parent household can raise a child to be a productive part of society by themselves. Children are a product of their environment, their WHOLE environment. That includes the daycare, the school, the church, the TV programs they watch, the people at the grocery store, their friends parents, everyone you let your child around is a part of who they are. <br>
<br>
Teachers are role models and children are naive. I do not want a selfish teacher as my child’s role model. Some teachers just go to 'work' to get a paycheck and others 'teach' because that is what they love. As a parent of a 3rd grader and 1st grader, and a mom whose dream is to become a teacher, I can certainly tell the difference between each teachers attitude from year to year. <br>
<br>
If my children are going to spend 7 hours a day, 5 days a week in a classroom for 13 years, you better believe that those teachers are instilling morals and values into my child, whether I want them to or not. For anyone to put <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the blame on the parents for things that children do is absolutely ignorant. If it takes a community to raise a child, it takes a community to ruin a child.<br>
<br>
The blame you can put on the parent is the act of being oblivious to their children’s surroundings. The parent who does nothing when their son or daughter acts out in a violent nature or the parent who does not take the time to get to know their children’s friends. The parents who don't monitor the TV programs their kids watch or the parents who don't move their children away from the foul mouthed idiot at the park. <br>
<br>
My responsibility to my family is to make sure that we are not surrounded by useless members of society and when they are, to explain to them why that behavior is unexceptable. I should be able to trust that the school has hired a qualified individual to be a role model and care for my children when I am not there. It's a shame to feel like I need to sit in the classroom and baby-sit the teacher because of the low standards the public school system has for their teaching staff.<br>

Allowing &quot;aggressive&quot; or &quot;violent&quot; behavior in children is what leads to kids getting injured.  The desire to injury proof the world is not just held by school officials, but by parents all across the nation.  If you are a school official then what do you do, stop the kids from playing or risk a lawsuit from a litigious society.  The real issue is that our culture has lost the definition of what is acceptable risk in the lives of minors.  They can't make choices for themselves because adults (often rightly) don't trust them to (when i was very young i broke my collar bone and so could not slide down the poll... so i jumped off the poll platform over and over until a teacher caught me).  <br>
<br>
It is not an easy question to determine what risk is acceptable in a school environment because when you think &quot;boys will be boys&quot; you might also find out &quot;parents will file a lawsuit.&quot;  I dont' want to come down too hard on parents as I don't know what it's like to have a child, but I think I can imagine that parents must become preoccupied with their children. An injury to your child when you trusted them in someone else's care may be infuriating,  but the truth is that accidents will happen and people shouldn't be punished unless they're found to be negligent.  The &quot;No Tolerance&quot; policies and the spitball agitator incident happen because I dont' know that the culture has a universal declaration of what is negligent, and in the wake of acts of school violence I think that people see warning signs in everything.<br>
<br>
When it comes down to it: school's just can't afford financially to take chances.<br>

So you want teachers and grocery baggers to instill morals on your children? No wonder so many people are broken in today's world. They have no center to create their lives around.<br>
<br>
As a parent it is MY responsibility to raise my children, not Old Man Wilson down the block who likes to play with his privates in public while staring at the little boys. YOU are your children's role model, whether you want to be or not.<br>
<br>
If you assume Carson Daily is going to raise your children with the same moral beliefs you hold dear, you are going to be in for a big surprise. You say it's your responsibility to make sure your children are not surrounded by useless members of society... and how do you plan to do that, kill all the useless ones or live in a cave?<br>
<br>
It's naive to trust everyone surrounding youe children. The key is to become a positive role model for your children, and instill in them a solid moral ground that they may stand upon when they are surrounded by a world full of pedophiliac priests and the nihilistic society that popular culture breeds.<br>

Your children wont always look to you and you alone for guidance and approval, unless you put them in a box under your bed. <br>
Even then they will probably end up taking advice from the rats that munch on their hair over you.<br>

You may not be raised in a box as teenagers, or you may have looked for role models and influences outside your family sphere even sooner, but to say society on a whole is responsible, even partially, for rearing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  your offspring</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is flirting with disaster. So...some think that on top of teaching, grading, and supervising our children, teachers are also responsible for instilling morality? As if cramped inner city schools had the luxury! What's that? Your kid would never end up on the bottom of the school district? I guess it's tough @#%$ for poor families.<br>
<br>
Yes, I'm rambling and assuming as I get angrier at a thread that grows increasingly ridiculous, fluffed by so much idealism and wrapped in blindfolds it makes me want to puke.<br>
<br>
NO ONE can tell a parent how to raise his/her kids, but a parent can't assume a community shares his/her best intentions for their children. Just like you can't blame parents for a kid going on a rampage school shooting, parents can't blame society's indifference (ohh, and it must be so tempting to ration the responsibility), or their belief in goodwill will reward them with a photo of their kid on a milk carton. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 5/24/02 5:07:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umahogani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mahogani</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Crack Dealer to the Stars</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/24/02 5:13:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=315.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.stationary.org/fantasy/peg.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Off topic/ Your opinion?</span><hr size=1> I scoff at it because it is a pie in the sky socialist view of the world that fails.

<br>
Having your children raised by those not close to the child, foments a atmosphere of apathy.  People who work for a government agency have too much going on to spend any sort of quality time with each child in their care.  Children need to know they are loved, and that people are interested in what they do and think.<br>
<br>
I never once suggested that children must not be influenced from outside the home, it can't be done.  My point is that if you take an important role in their upbringing, you create a solid base for them to be able to judge the value of outside influences.<br>
<br>
A society shouldn't strive to have any influence on child-raising, because there are too many different ideas on what is right and what is wrong.  Who is going to decide what values to promote, and which to squelch?  How many different religions are there in the world?  Which one do you think should set the morals for your child?  How about your neighbors children?  Morals come from religious beliefs, the American society is based on a Judeo-Christian set of morals, should we force those beliefs on people raised in the Budhist faith?<br>

You are pointing the finger at me saying my way of thinking is pure idealism based in a positive utopian mindset (as if thats wrong) yet you want me to stop and instead accept YOUR idealistic world in which a society &quot;shouldn't strive to have any influence on child-raising&quot; (pure idealism based in a negative utopian mindset) ?<br>

Nice try, but my view of society does NOT require full participation, while yours does.  If you go back, you can actually see that I said:<br>
<br>
&quot; I never once suggested that children must not be influenced from outside the home, it can't be done. My point is that if you take an important role in their upbringing, you create a solid base for them to be able to judge the value of outside influences.&quot;<br>
<br>
There can be wackos out there who can try to influence my children with their particular flavor of idealism, and it will pass right by them.  In your model of society, EVERYONE is required to be willing participants in raising YOUR children, with the same values you hold dear.  There is no idealism in my philosophy, while yours is all idealism.<br>
<br>
Your quote is nice, too bad is has nothing to do with what I said earlier, so I'll say it a different way; Requiring society to raise your children with your beliefs requires society to share your beliefs.<br>
<br>
Oh, another quote that doesn't fit, though it can be turned around.  If you tried to influence my children, I would consider you a griefer, but you demand I influence your children, and raise them how you want them raised.  I want you to butt-out, and you want me to do your job for you.  Are you sure you would want me, a Conservative Republican influencing your children's world view?  I didn't think so...

I never asked you to raise my children, im asking you to face the fact that others ultimately will whether you like or not. You say you realize this, yet you refuse to take any action against negative influences... I dont get it... <br>
Im asking you to stop bitching about the people that accept this and decide to make a stand, demanding responsibility for societies actions, especially the ones that work with our children.<br>
<br>
If you were to read previous threads where I state my opinion in child rearing you will see I believe parents should take FULL responsibility for their kids actions. Yet that shouldnt stop us from demanding the same moral responsibility from others...again especially the ones that (WE PAY to) work with our children.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of your post, it just goes in circles for me. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Requiring society to raise your children with your beliefs requires society to share your beliefs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

I think this is where we are having problems...you require your child to have YOUR *moral viewpoints/religion*, I would just require that my child has moral viewpoints and integrity. <br>
So, society doesnt have to have my beliefs...in fact im glad they dont for the most part, it would be a really shitty world if I wasnt able to choose a path due to lack of choices.<br>
<br>
Also I think we are talking about different ages.<br>

<br>
Others <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  raise</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> your children when you're out of sight? That's a strong word. I'd say others influence or encourage/discourage already-formed ideas in children when parents are not there, unless the time kids spent with their parents growing up are so fragile and easily broken it requires the parent be there 24/7 to instill a core value system over and over.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm asking you to stop bitching about the people that accept this and decide to make a stand, demanding responsibility for societies actions, especially the ones that work with our children.&quot;<br>
<br>
How about I take responsibility for myself and realize it's impossible for society, including caretakers, to act within the bounds of what I see as acceptable day in and day out?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Yet that shouldnt stop us from demanding the same moral responsibility from others...again especially the ones that (WE PAY to) work with our children.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> idealistic, Sublac. How do you know a teacher's moral compass points in the same direction as yours unless you're willing to take the time to screen adults that have a lot of contact with your children? When a parent takes full responsibility for their kids, as they should, they explain what is/is not acceptable behavior and language, instill a belief in a higher being (or not), a racial outlook, a work ethic, value of possessions, etc. The list can go on forever. Yet you claim other members of society have a moral obligation to rear your (generic) children? Well...will it be a Christian rearing, Buddhist, maybe Muslim rearing? Will these people have to turn their ethics (religious and otherwise) around to fit your picture of the world around your kids? Understand that what is true for me may not be true for you. There is no &quot;ultimate truth&quot; different peoples share. You're holding the world up to an impossible standard and asking it to bend itself around your kids when it is easier to be a guide yourself and let kids form their own opinions of society.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 5/25/02 11:57:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uafropyrm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>afroPyrm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/25/02 4:29:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=315.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Off topic/ Your opinion?</span><hr size=1> Do any of you, who are arguing so adamantly about the formation of human psyche, actually have any type of formal training in the area?
