The opinions about Opalmoon and Avis differ alot and i will leave by that. If other members feel they need to voice their opinion about it, i cant help with it.<br>

I could post a 10000 words long post and it wouldnt help no one. <br>

You don't try to delete a guild website when you do.  You don't spread lies about the people that you called friends for 2 yrs.  And you call ME deranged *shrug*.  Thorwald is right, it's my personal opinion, I wasn't in MK when this occurred.  AS to my holier than thou attitude, yes I have a tendency to pass judgement on people that screw others over, you think I'm a maniac for that?  Am I being vindictive, hell yes, although Avis did nothing more than lie to me and be manipulative, he sums up all that I dislike about this game.  <br>
<br>
I have no desire to start a guild, a small caring guild is one thing but guilds are full of people with the mememe attitude.  You don't know me and honestly, your opinion of me doesn't upset me.  I related something that happened.  You don't want to believe it *shrug*<br>
<br>
As to Keluli, hmmm I didn't find her an asset to my groups that she gated out of groups when things looked bad.  I didn't find her an asset when a friend of mine died in her group, she disbanded him, replaced him and didn't res him for over an hour.  I didn't think she was an asset when she missed heals when she was too busy looting every mob that dropped.  I didn't think she was an asset when she gated on a EW group and never came back to rez us.  So I'm a bitch for relating that to Droz?  *shrug*<br>
<br>
Yeah, I slam people....always funny that there's people out there get bent all out of shape when someone speaks the truth and calls it mud slinging gossip.  Maybe you should reflect on how many flames I actually start about people, and give me the benefit of considering it the truth.<br>

WTF ??  Can you say two faced ?  Why did you never tell me and Avis your true feelings of us ? Why act like our friend ??  God damn if you dont like me tell me dont act like you do ...I have done nothing but be nice to you.  <br>
<br>
Makes me wonder who else hates my guts and been calling me sis//friend all this time ..<br>
<br>
I dont put on an act I am who I am take me as I am or leave me but dont talk behind my back ...WE never asked any of MK that came to DF to come they asked US ...I still have many many friends in MK ..Thorwald you are still my bro just because we left MK doesnt mean we dont like any of you less and those I call sister/friend is what they are to me ..I would never say anything mean about one I call a friend ...<br>
<br>
The true story of MK was that I saw greed. complaints..noone showing for raids on time ..Ninja looting from a recruit when our rules were recruits could roll on certain things when a recruit won on a roll two guildmembers stole from her ..Officers were involved ..and all they could say about it was they didnt think the recruit deserved it ...WELL damnit she did and by our rules at the time she should have got it period .. I didnt build MK to turn into a bunch of loot hungry assholes !!!  Most of them werent but if I would have kicked those that were I would have had to dealt with more stress then I was already having to deal with as being the leader of a guild especially the one of the size of MK was hard enuf .. I made alot of wrong decisions in who I made officers too ...Some turned out to be drill seargents telling people what to do and @#%$ ... what was I supposed to do demote them ? and get my ass ripped apart  ...<br>
as far as avis and I only coming back to MK if he was made leader that is crap ! Nemglani the person I gave guild to was already trying to find a new leader for it cuz he was already sick of the BS after 3 days or a week or whatever ..Avis was gonna take it back and kick the jerks from it thats the truth.<br>
<br>
And as far as avis USING people thats BS is we were using people to get items etc dont you think he would have gotten his epic a lil soon hell some of MK didnt even wanna help him .. you have no idea how much money he put into MK buying coffins for CR and @#%$ when some of Mk didnt even care and treated him like @#%$ ...NO I am not talking about all of MK I am saying some of MK ...<br>
<br>
So its like this if we call you sis /friend/ bro you are that to us ..if we have you on ignore we dont like you you have stabbed us in the back .. <br>
<br>
and no I would never go back to MK now I was gonna going to but a person I trusted Miina invited a person I have hated in this game for the past 3 yrs Marklar into MK .. knowing full well I hated his guts and would never come back if he was there ...and yes miina your on ignore too you two faced bitch!<br>
<br>
And I will say just one more thing ...Recruiting with wraith this past week has been the most fun I have had in game in a long time ..seeing new things going new places and meeting new people .. and no my oppinion of wraith before actually being with them was not good, I thought of them as just another uber guild that ks's and stuff ...Now I feel way different ..Wraith is a group of great people that know their @#%$ and how to take on the biggest mobs and not fail !! And I would be honored to be a part of them and Avis too.<br>
<br>
one last thing /IGNORE Arianwen /tear<br>
<br>
