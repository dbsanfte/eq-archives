<br>
I'm pretty certain that if we stuck up a poll asking this, you'd find the voting pretty one sided. There'd be you on one side, Gael, and then most everyone else saying they'd not be sharing a guildtag and joint reputation with the guildie in question, one way or another - be it by going through whatever internal procedures you might have and detagging her, or by leaving and finding another guild that isn't tainted by her actions and reputation.<br>
<br>
I don't care how good a monk she is (and have no knowledge of this apart from being KSed by her intermittently), she would have been long gone from DoSG for her spiteful childish attitude and lack of visible ethics. Admittedly, we aren't a power guild in any way shape or form - we exist as a social group for mutual support and entertainment. We're far too British to be serious for long enough to become powerful. However, I just could not envision her lasting past the first couple of incidents that have been reported about her even if we were godlike *shrug*. if she was acting like this in one of our Allied guilds, even, I'd be seriously talking to the leader to find out what was going to be done about it, and I know Reyu or Kimja (should MC ever reform under him) would be listening attentively. Ideally reputation SHOULD be based on an individual, and guilds should not be smeared by the actions of one member. Sadly that isn't the way the relational dynamics of EQ work.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Seriously if you have a really bad incident come to me and I will resolve it... No need to come here.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There is EVERY need to come here. You apparently seem unable to resolve any issues with Sirinab to the satisfaction of anyone but her and yourself, so what good would taking her stupidities to you do? If we report them here (note the use of the word report; I refuse to flame her as such, since I'm fairly sure she is getting some sort of weird jollies from that) at least others will know of her and her deserved reputation as a total and utter mongbat will have a chance to spread and precede her. Here we have a forum designed to allow us to alert our community to problems such as her attitude, and I know I'm damn well going to take advantage of the facility when necessary.<br>
<br>
If I have a problem with Sirinab that is serious enough to need to talk to your guild leadership about, I would talk to Seph. No offence, but I sincerely doubt from your posts here that you would be able to act impartially in relation to her. I would hope Seph would know me or Quas or Bulvai enough to at least listen to our concerns..<br>
<br>
Note though, that this is not just true of her. I would inform people of anyone who acted like my 5 year old neice with her dolly taken away. It just so happens that Sirinab KEEPS doing stupid things and pissing people off. You say we're all jumping on a bandwagon about her. I for one am not, she just happens to have screwed me over recently, so I let you know. If she stopped being a total prat, I'm sure people would stop posting about her, and by the same token if someone else started to act as antisocially towards us, we'd tell you about them too.<br>

<br>
First to Bulvai.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am willing to question you because you've become the defacto Public Relations Officer for RIP, poor guy.&quot;<br>
<br>
     I am willing to accept that position.. Someone has to troll these boards to make sure the guild reputation is maintained..<br>
<br>
&quot;I also understand fully that Siri is the best ya'll have and I pity you all for that.To be honest, she's not a bad puller. But I can name 10-12 pullers that are that much better.&quot;<br>
<br>
     that an insult? I meant she was the best FD puller we have. In my opinion.. That doesn't mean we are short handed or full of bad FDers I meant she is one of the best I've seen.. She rarely makes mistakes and usually gets a single. You seen her pull on raids?<br>
<br>
&quot;The problem exists that even were she the Monk BotB for the server, I'd still not want her to have the same guild tag as me, due to her attitude, let alone her actions. Then again, RIP has shown time and again that the toon is more important than the person behind the toon. Not meaning that as a flame necessarily, more as a statement of fact about the prevailing attitude and style of those I know in the guild. Then again I can say the same about VM, LC, and any of the other guilds with such things as level minimums, required equipment, etc.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Sirinab has an additude? I'll agree with that.. Actions not words are what makes a person. As far as actions go.. The only time I can really think of a bad action was the Thurgadin banker and that was a bad judgement call on her part. I'm not Sirinab's guardian.. I can't watch her all day but stories get to me and I investigate them personally and report to Sephrok.. Get all sides of the story.. In fact the last incident with Sirinab supposely training the group she was joining.. He agreed with me that its stupid and overblown in that case. We do listen to each case about a member going postal and discuss it.. There have been a few members who were kicked out because of their actions.. Sirinab is not one of them. And about that comment with VM and LC with requirements? We do have those requirements too.. Screen each person to see if they are acceptable to the team.. Yes, performance is more important than additude but if they have such a bad additude they don't get in and we have already had a case of that..  We strive to be the best and the best is only what we will do.. Personally I do think Rel In Por is one of the top 5 guilds in strength and ability.. We are also one of the fastest growing on the server too and not because we are letting everyone in but because we have many people who want to join based on our ideals and performance.. Unfortunately some have to be turned away If they don't meet our standards.<br>
<br>
&quot;RIP, with some good recruiting, could be a very strong force. There are some very talented and driven people in RIP, or at least there were the last time I was on. There are also some major jerks.&quot;<br>
<br>
     We do do good recruitment as I said in the previous post.. A jerk is a matter of opinion.. We have turned away many people based on their additudes.. In fact we turned away people with bad additudes even though we needed thier class bad. So that shows we have integrity too.. Sirinab made the cut.. So if you think she is bad.. see some of those recruits we turned away..<br>
<br>
&quot;I feel for you, Gaelron, as I think you are fighting a thoroughly unwinnable battle.&quot;<br>
<br>
Probably, You have all made up your minds. I don't think I can change them.<br>
<br>
now for Shagbert<br>
<br>
dont want to recopy what you said here this post is long enough so I will say this..<br>
<br>
Again we check into all incidents throughly.. Some guilds do have a tight robe to walk.. Yes we are more flexible than some. But we still have rules.. See our website (www.relinpor.com) and check it out.. we have a section somewhere on conduct. I talk with people all the time about guild reputation.. It is VERY important to be with a guild with a good reputation..<br>
<br>
    Yes this form is designed to alert people of the bad eggs which is why I've been defending Sirinab  because she is a guildmate whose actions are blown out of proportion but when a new &quot;Sirinab did this&quot; post comes up every 2 days.. It getting really tiresome.. Can't you find anyone else to pick on?<br>
<br>
&quot;If I have a problem with Sirinab that is serious enough to need to talk to your guild leadership about, I would talk to Seph. No offence, but I sincerely doubt from your posts here that you would be able to act impartially in relation to her. I would hope Seph would know me or Quas or Bulvai enough to at least listen to our concerns..&quot;<br>
<br>
     Good.. Thats how the system works.. We have other officers too you can come to if you don't think I'm up to it.. Sephrok would definitely listen to you and try to resolve it.. I consider him one of the best guild leaders I've Had to deal with.<br>
<br>

<br>
I can respect that. I did much the same for Moonlight Crusaders. Admittedly we had WAY less posts pop up about MC people. In fact, I can only recall two incidents ever. Then again, we had a sterling rep and protected it aggressively.<br>
<br>
&quot;that an insult? I meant she was the best FD puller we have. In my opinion.. That doesn't mean we are short handed or full of bad FDers I meant she is one of the best I've seen.. She rarely makes mistakes and usually gets a single. You seen her pull on raids?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope, not an insult, and, yep, seen her pull on raids, last time I was saw her pull was a Trak raid a coupla months ago. I wasn't all that impressed, actually. She didn't listen very well, b!tched at people if she was told to hold off, wouldn't sit still long enough to get buffed, and then b!tched about not having buffs. All in all, she acted like a spoiled brat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, performance is more important than additude but if they have such a bad additude they don't get in and we have already had a case of that.. &quot;<br>
<br>
As I said, the toon is more important than the person behind the toon. It is a choice you all made, and while I disagree with it, it is not a disagree that I disrespect you all for. However, I disagree with that statement, simply because Sirinab has one of the worst attitudes I've had the displeasure of seeing. I've been invited on RIP raids before and not gone because I knew certain toons would be present. Thus I would state that performance is more important than attitude as well in RIP.<br>
<br>
&quot;In fact we turned away people with bad additudes even though we needed thier class bad. So that shows we have integrity too.. Sirinab made the cut.. So if you think she is bad.. see some of those recruits we turned away..&quot;<br>
<br>
I believe you on this, and won't even make any of the sarcastic jokes that I'd love to here, simply because I know what sort of tripe we turned away in MC. I think the thing I am most guilty is attempting to hold RIP to my personal standard, much like I hold each individual to my personal standard. I am a good player, an honourable player. I care about how I impact on others enjoyment of this game. The guilds of which I am proud to have been a members, cared about how they affected others enjoyment. Sirinab does not care, nor does it appear that RIP cares.<br>
<br>
I would love to be equananimous enough to say that I will not be so judgemental as to hold you, your guild, and others to my own admittedly tough standard, but it will not happen.<br>
<br>
If this were RL, and involved someone in your neighbourhood acting this way, would you tolerate it? If not, why tolerate it in game?<br>

Did it ever occur to you that the person behind Sirinab is one of the coolest friggen people in the world? Its true..  and infact we strive on recruiting on personality rather then equip etc..  ask Toofas, he's naked (just came from another server) and we're giving him the time of day.  Why? Cos' he rox .. he's a nice guy and a skilled shaman.<br>
<br>
If you guys have a problem with -ONE- person, why post the flame here?  If everyone posted their problems with -ONE- person here, then this forum would be so large, EZboards wouldn't have enough dough to keep it running.  Why not take it up with the person your flaming, maybe there was a misunderstanding (like in the 3 spider thing..)... work it out before you bring a pointless flame to the board.  All that pointless crap w/ misunderstanding &amp; false accusations is what gets a person their rep.<br>
<br>
A post here generaly goes like this:<br>
&quot;This person sucks.&quot;<br>
&quot;I agree!&quot;<br>
&quot;me too.&quot;<br>
&quot;yeah they suck, they stole 1p from me before in a trade.&quot;<br>
<br>
-by the time someone gets a chance to defend themselves, they have 1053 people against them.. how would you feel? wouldn't you get a lil hostile w/ everyone against you.-<br>
<br>
-by the time the average reader gets through the post, their mind is et on &quot;hey.. they do suck..&quot;.. im sure you can imagine the rest from there..-<br>
<br>
Person:&quot;I didn't do it, really,&quot; blah balh nice explanation etc.<br>
&quot;You must have doneit, cos' you suck and 10 people agree!&quot;<br>
Person: &quot;wtf i swear, you guys are a bunch of loosers and can't see whats going on&quot;<br>
&quot;you suck more!&quot;<br>
<br>
etc etc..<br>
<br>
Wanna know something else?  I sat at the zone in Velks with Sirinab before... while she was accused of a TRAIN for just sitting there... funny huh?..  Someone could have easily posted a flame for sitting her arse at the zone, while some other idiot pulled a train through, and she just so happened to be FD, partialy afk or something, and get the blame for it.  Talk about false accusation.<br>

And if her bad behavior is related to Velks.. Then it doesn't count.. Velks is the worst zone in the game.. All the Ass holes go there and im not generalizing.. Sirinab is well behaved compared to many people there.. I was once savenging for threads and I went to US and they accused me of stealing mobs from their camp.. I pull one mob from their area once for my SH group and they swear at me.. even though they have more mobs then they can handle... You get one mob on you and you have to zone or FD and it jumps someone they accuse you of training them..<br>
<br>
Bad behavior in Velk doesnt count cause everyone does it. <p><a href="http://worldzone.net/technology/brian2554//signature.gif" target="_blank">

<br>
I believe you posted the flame that said something like &quot;you flame on the boards and you have to take the consequences&quot;.  Well I would just like to refer back to your comments in previous flames and point out that you again show yourself to be a hypocrite, asking others not to judge your guild based on the actions of one person when you have already done the same.  You raised hell on the boards telling people how horribly you had been mistreated and then falsely blamed an entire guild for what one person (who probably wasn't even in NP) did to you.  How about following your own advice?<br>
<br>
And yes, Velks can get stupid at times but to say bad behavior just doesn't count there has got to be one of the most utterly moronic comments I've ever heard.  Just because it's a bad zone does not make it right to do bad things and how anyone can make a comment as ridiculous as that is beyond me.  Good people will always find a way around a bad situation but it seems to me that you're saying people who add to the situation to make it worse are doing something good in your eyes.<br>

Any negative reflection being directed to RIP is the apparent difference of opinion in handling the maverick actions of a player associated with said guild.  Dare I say a remarkeable diffidence.  I am amused by the everybody does it comment so that means it's justified.  I'm sure if there was a riot going on in your hometown, you'd feel perfectly ok being part of the mob and that your actions are justified looting and pillaging...because everybody is doing it?

Seriously, whats there to debate? I mean, I hear gaelron basically calling the bards wimps cuz they got upset about her pulling mobs into camp, well hell, I play a chanter, and I'd be pissed off too, its just common courtesty, I know if I was playing my warrior and I was enough to even find a damn group in Velks, I would make sure I got there without aggroing anything....I mean c'mon folks, it's not like its hard to do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
But I guess its easy for a pally to say that seeing as all they gotta do is hit the attack button and pretty much not think, and if crap goes bad they always got LOH, where as a bard has to handle the situation and try not to get themselves killed in the process....not saying they cant do it without a problem, but hey they shouldnt HAVE too....<br>
<br>
And even if yer excuse is that Velks is a mad house....then what the hell was up with thurg?? I mean  I know that is old news, but I still have vivid memories of sirinabs silly ass running up and down outside the bank taunting some poor fool who called her a name or something....completetly pissing off the entire zone in the process cuz she was killing the bankers to get back at this person, not giving 2 sh*ts for the other dozen or so people ther needing to bank (myself included)...and I even remember her refering to herself as god a few times in /OOC.....sure it went on and on, but I zoned in disgust <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As far as judging a whole guild by the actions of one person, thats just stupid....but for that guild to get on these boards and not only defend this person for these actions and then try to tell us how 'friggin cool' this person is, is a big ole load of troll poop.

and on a last note.....as to why people feel a need to post on these boards, you think if we took up these issues with sirinab in the game, we would get any reply other than 'shut up you n00b'?

Maybe we've been seeing this wrong? Perhaps Siri isn't saying 'no-one' in the sense of 0 visitors to the board, so much as the people who DO come here are nobodies in her book.

     That training comment was blown out of proportion... I said originally the way they treated us was downright rude.. Especially for asking permission first and getting an ok to move in (mistell my ass).. That was the action of over 1 person of a guild.. <br>
<br>
&quot;And yes, Velks can get stupid at times but to say bad behavior just doesn't count there has got to be one of the most utterly moronic comments I've ever heard.

<br>
     I didn't justify it I said since many people do it why single out Sirinab? As Sephrok said she was sitting at zone once and was accused of training.. People target her because of her rep.<br>

As for sirn...I have personally never seen her do anything she has been accused of...from rl friends who play the game stories have been passed along... I don't have much respect for her for the fact that her form of defense is to lash out at the people who bring a story to these boards. The story may be exagerated but to outright lash out at the person seems to make me a bit more hard on her. <br>
<br>
Rational explanations go a lot further for me and gael brings a bit of that...although it would bring a much better weight coming from her since direct comments are not misconstrude by the intermidary. No offense gael<br>
