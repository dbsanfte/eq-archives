And as far as running a mob by him, yup sure did, if you and him wanted to play on a technicality by saying it would be KS'ing if I attacked him while the banker was hitting on him, well then I just might happen to have a mob on me and not know where the zone line is. Eye for an eye Salta.<br>
<br>
Funny I could have sworn I remembered you denying you knew Colach had aggro...  Oh wait here it is!<br>
Quote from the NP flame by Sirinab...<br>
When I ran the banker around the corner the guy had aggro'd which I did not know<br>
<br>
LOL and there you have it Gaelron....  As far as killing the bankers go it may not technically be against the rules of EQ, however my problem has never been with killing the bankers.  Intentionally training (which Sirinab just admitted to on an open forum) is completely against the rules and this is what she did.  You ask me to bring up new material but I have stuck to the banker thing because it is what I know and what I have witnessed.  You always ask others to not go based on rumors but on proof, always coming to the boards like some poor victimized monkey who everyone likes picking on for all the wrong reasons.  Well I'd say getting caught in the midst of a lie supports the people claiming you are a liar.  (I didnt know he had aggro... oh wait I'll change my story now I knew he had aggro).<br>
<br>
You said &quot;eye for an eye Salta&quot; like we had wronged you in some way, always trying to turn the situation around on others.  We merely began to think like you (gasp) and realized that if we hit the banker first you could not kill it according to EQ rules.  We engaged a banker to stop the argument and let the people who you were exchanging harrassments with in ooc get on with their business and have fun playing this game.  If there's some sort of horridness in trying to make the game fun for others then by all means let me know...  you're the one going on and on like anyone who takes this game at all seriously has problems and then when Colach and I tried to make it so people wouldn't be pissed off you treat us as some sort of horrible people.  Face it, you got outsmarted by some do-gooders and now you have publicly shown yourself to be a liar by directly contradicting a statement you had previously made.  If anyone reads Sirinabs posts from which I quoted and honestly believes that she is not a liar and did not admit to training then you are quite delusional and/or utterly stupid.<br>
<br>
/waits for the predictable reply of &quot;I dont care what board lurkers think, all people ever do is spread rumors about me and even though I actually admitted to this it's still just a rumor&quot; now that she knows she's been beaten.<br>
<br>

I was referring to ME aggro'ing the GUILD LEADER ROGUE on me.. if you learned to READ you would know that.  Try again!

Since when does saying I ran a mob to zone admit to training someone?  Especially since you are insisting I did it with the intent to kill him.<br>

Ok, state your whine and move on.  Instead you insist on continuing posting tryin to start more @#%$.<br>

Doh, you played your wild card too soon and got beat with a full house!  Try again Salta so far the people that have &quot;flamed&quot; against me dont have 1/50th the brain power to &quot;outsmart&quot; me.  You as well as everyone else that has whined so far have YET to come up with a story that is worth spending hours bitching about on a message board.  If you REALLY want to cry about crap like that, please, for the sake of all of us, start a journal or something because hearing it is just flat out pathetic.<br>

&quot;I give up, she has posted a legit response to every flame attempt thrown at her.  Next time I falme her i'll have even more stories made up!&quot;<br>

Pretty neat how I saw a final flame trying to catch me in a lie coming, well sorry, I havent lied about anything since this whole flame deal started.. because in fact there is nothing to lie about.. because nothing I was accused of was even *close* to be given as much attention as you people have.<br>

The only point you proved Nitch is that you had no argument and will go to any length to save your pride.  Which I do give you credit for.  I think you learned you'll need more fire power next time you wanna start @#%$ with me.<br>

No flame here just to prove how stupid you really are. Go up to the saintx13 and click on it. Then go to the last post on Sherdog.com and check what time it was posted and then see what time the post was on here from that same account. Sorry to bust your bubble but i'm not gonna waste my time logging on to another account to make you look bad, you do a good enough job of it yourself. <p><br><center><img src="http://nitchjuggallo420.homestead.com/files/nitchusa2.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=675" target=_blank>Nitch's Inventory</a>

NITCH!  That's my boy Petey in the alternate Sig whooping Coleman!<br>
<br>
Next time I poke into Quell I'll look you up.  I trained at the Lion's Den about 2 years as a student, and also with Frank when the Lodi gym closed for about 2 years after that (I'm a good 2 years from being in regular training tho.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh.. and to keep this on topic... just a thought.... if training is so blatantly against the rules and is a bannable offence (and it is, this is the point), why would Sirinab do that.... BUT wouldn't killsteal the banker?  I mean, why not just ks him anyway  instead of pulling an intentional wipe-out-people train (if that really was the intent).... I wasn't there, but from my own experience with sirinab and common sense, this whole scenario sounds odd.  More like she's killing the banker for cheap laughs, someone else aggros the banker stop her, she does something that gets blown out of proportion both by people taking things too seriously and a mistake on her part.<br>
<br>
Not to say you don't have a right to be annoyed/mad (I think that's part of the joke)...but she's hardly Mohogany or one of the old-timer &quot;gans&quot;...<br>

I have watched this flaming going on for the past week and a half to two weeks. I didn't want to butt in because I don't know anyone personally, and I am the last person to take sides over something I am not involved in. I have not witnessed the alleged incidents, and I am not affiliated with any guild that has been mentioned on any of the sides but here is my 2cp anyway...<br>
<br>
First of all Sirinia, I on behalf of all lower levels who tend to be at the mercy of the whims of high level players, I think your attitude in regards to the banker sucks. What you said about banking &quot;what's so fun about banking?&quot; in response to the players in the area having fun is so disrespectful. You aren't the only one who finds it fun to kill bankers, vendors and guards but that doesn't make it right. You are inconveniencing a lot of people who may have limited playtime or don't want to put up with that kind of grief. When I go to the bank, I expect the banker to be there. When I go to a vendor who is the ONLY one in the zone selling what I need, I expect them to be there. Your cavalier attitude basically says &quot;F!ck You&quot; to anyone wanting to enjoy the game as it was intended. Whether or not you trained an NPC onto someone who was engaging the banker so that others could do their banking (of course, why would you expect people to go to the bank for that??) is beside the point, and since I wasn't there, I won't pass judgement either way. IF you did such a thing, that would speak volumes about your character or lack thereof. I was curious about how you said you got stunned and ran the way you were pointing...I learned at a young age to watch where I turn, but that's just me, I am sure a monk of your esteemed level knows more than me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ignorance is not an excuse for bad behavior, and the attitude you SEEM to show about things shows a less than caring one. You are probably a nice person, I have seen posts that you help out people in need. I think it's great that you spent a couple hours helping people do CR. If you were that conscientious all the time, instead of not thinking just what seems fun at the time regardless of who gets hurt in the process, no one would be flaming you.<br>

<br>
I understand what you mean aobut lwoer levels and all but I think one thing you should remember is that this *is* a game and to not take things liek not having the banker available immediately when you want it *really* isnt something to get angry over.... sh.it happens and yes it was a joke.  Its not the first time i've done it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>

About the getting stunned thing, it was part of the sarcasm/technicality issue that was brought up by Salta.<br>
<br>
I dont agree that my attitude is the &quot;fuc.k you&quot; kind.. but its quite the oposite, I am/have been very open minded and heared each and every one of the posters out.  Now I havent gotten alot of that same respect but there are alot of differences in people, maturity being one of them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I also do not believe I &quot;hurt&quot; anyone in the process of killing the bankers.<br>
<br>
With that said I thank you for being mature when jumping in to give your opinion and I respect that.<br>
