I personally do not see anything wrong with Under god in the allegiance.  Its been there since the 50's and no one said anything about it and its in many other government documents.  The father bringing this up is just wanting attention.  If you don't want your kid to hear Under god then take them to your house and home school them.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the current pledge  of allegiance.<br>
<br>
Remove Under god that is fine but they still need to read the pledge of allegiance every day.<br>

-- Eadric<br>
<br>
Honestly, E. Without taking a poll or tapping into the political pulse of the nation with a talk show of my very own, I think the average American doesn't care about the pledge either way. It can stay up or it can go down. More are concerned about getting by, an illness in the family, a personal circumstance more intimate than two words and the history thereof as they go on with their lives. Not everyone takes the day's topic to heart and it's all right as long as they choose to let it go by instead of avoid every topic that comes along. It's setting your priorities, and shrugging your shoulders doesn't make one a dull person because a reference to a higher being in schools fails to raise bile in one's throat. Do you think perhaps few feel inclined to involve themselves, as you surmise, because the issue is important to a minority and has less to do with Bush's simple reaction?<br>
<br>
&quot;We could just remove the 'under god' part would that really upset everyone?&quot;<br>
-- Gaelron<br>
<br>
It doesn't bother me either way. The reason for which revision was sought is shifty and I imagine conservatives will have a field day with this guy. IMO he deserves whatever verbal criticism they dish out for mocking the sincerity with which such lawsuits should be pursued.<br>
<br>
I don't know how much time and people energy it would take to return the pledge to its original form. I'd guess not a lot. I'm worried about people like Varro using the victory as a means to call other inconsistencies out and demand that all references to god be erased from public view, from government life. At that point I'd rather taxes, if any monies is used to accommodate such people, to go to something else. Like the budget deficit, or a tax break for affordable housing. I'd rather money be used to include as many as possible without rearranging the world to fit someone's universe.<br>

<br>
Bulvai and Bubbalotski had some excellent insights, and pretty much cut to the heart of the matter as i see it.  the lawsuit never should have been brought.  its timing was very poor, and the motivations behind it were self serving and fanatical.  despite all this, the ruling was in fact correct, and those who dismiss it offhand as &quot;ridiculous,&quot; as our noble president did, are simply taking the oppurtunity to flaunt their ignorance in a nation that is more and more coming to embrace it.<br>
<br>

This country was founded by PROFITEERS and CORPORATIONS. The Pilgrims were about intolerant of relgious freedom as there was. One colony -- Rhode Island -- was founded on the basis of religious freedom.&quot;<br>
<br>
Don't mix up the Pilgrims with the Puritans, there are political and religious differences between them and their beliefs in how their objectives should be attained.  Pilgrims believed they should separate themselves from England if they did not follow what they percieved as God's will.  Puritans believed that the British government and church should be purified of secular elements. (To reinforce the concept of the divine right of the monarchy to rule.)  The last time I checked, the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Plymouth were not located in Rhode Island, but Massachusetts.  Did history rewrite itself since my days in school or did the state borders shift that much?  Pennsylvania, New Amsterdam (now New York), Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, and Virginia also had early settlements established by people seeking to practice religion in their own way.  Whether or not their descendants later became intolerant of different faiths and forgot why their forefathers came there in the first place does not change the fact that they were established for religious reasons.<br>
<br>
As far as settlements like Fort Amsterdam and Jamestown setting up provisions for making money via trade with Europe, what horrible self-serving people they must have been for taking steps to ensure they and their families can eat and survive to see the next year.  As opposed to expecting the Native Americans who already live in the region to give them everything they need.  So what if a European business or bank that spent their money to fund these colonists' trip here and initial costs to establish a colony or trade center finally turned them a profit after a decade or so?  They saw an opportunity to make money from someone seeking to leave for unexplored country, took enormous financial risks and it eventually paid off.  <br>
<br>
And  &quot;The people did not flee england becuase of religous persecution, they can over here to be separate from the religion of the day.&quot;<br>
<br>
Are you saying that from 1553 to 1558, Mary Tudor did not order the arrest and execution of hundreds of people of the Protestant faith in order to return England to the Roman Catholic faith?  This wholesale slaughter, which earned her the nickname &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; led to an exodus of many not of the Catholic faith from England to other parts of Europe and America.  Revisionist history strikes again. <br>
<br>
Gurunt states:  &quot;This lawsuit and the fact that Americans will actually argue about this retarded thing with such ferver is why people in other countries who starve for a living think Americans are pampered self-centered assholes.&quot;<br>
<br>
I really don't care overmuch what other countries think of us, as they hate us anyway.  People in other countries starve due to their own government's abuses of powers and &quot;retarded things&quot; like worrying about what the United States is doing, instead of the fact that their own people are experiencing drought, famine, epidemic illnesses and what they can do to curtail their own problems.<br>
<br>
Varro states:  &quot;My point with the book issue is not that I doubt the possibility of books being banned, but that I believe that issue is seperate from the one we are talking about. It is a what if claim that really has no basis in this argument because the reasons for banning a book are quite different from the reasons for removing &quot;Under God&quot; from the pledge.&quot;<br>
<br>
Esmalyn basically summed up my thoughts on it, that its likely to be used as fuel to spur on other demands to erase each and every word that can possibly offend someone.  When I first saw the headline, my initial thought was someone got expelled in regard to reciting the pledge.  I read the article and a few other related articles and it became readily apparent that man has an agenda against the government and he used his daughter to further it without the slightest concern for how it's going to impact her life.  And as far as book banning goes, religion is often cited as a motivating factor on both sides (For and against the concept of a god) and often start very shortly after incidents like this.  <br>

<br>
a fox news poll said 12 percent said the Pledge as it is is unconstitutional.. 12 percent is a lot when you think about it.<br>
<br>
a few other popular arguements id like to debunk.<br>
<br>
&quot;This country was founded by God loving people if you dont like it leave&quot;<br>
<br>
No.. This country was founded by people of all faiths and its in our constitution to have government and religion seperate so it doesnt matter what everyone believes in.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is that big a deal to say &quot;under god&quot; or can't you not say it at all&quot;<br>
<br>
To me? no but to others of a faith it can be very disrespectful.  Is it that big a deal to remove it?<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't have to say the pledge&quot;<br>
<br>
No you don't but lets look at this closer.. This is about people who are in school right now.. If you are 8 years old peer pressure means a lot to you.. If you don't stand during the pledge people will stare at you and mock you with the side of an after school beating.  Its more about being &quot;uncomfortable&quot; to a student.<br>
<br>
oh and this has nothing to do with hating your country or disrespecting those in the military or those who died for this country. <br>
<br>
After 9/11 any time to bring this up would have been bad.. Everyone is so offended these days. <p><center>

<br>
 As an additional note - do you folks really believe the 'liberty and justice for all' bit? While we do enjoy a large measure of liberty and to some extent justice, more so than many in the world, its pretty easy to argue that equal justice for all in this country is little more than a fairly cruel joke in reality to be honest. If people really want to engender a sense of responsibility and participation in the country, we should have a universal mandatory military service period or something similar like so many other nations do. Making kids say the pledge doesn't mean a heck of a lot or teach a heck of a lot. It amuses me that anyone gets upset about this at all. I mean do you people march to your beds and say it each night? I doubt it. In fact I bet none of you have thought about it since the last time you were forced to repeat it. <br>
<br>
 Predictibly though, lawmakers like to waste time on this rubbish instead of the more pressing issues since it makes it look like they are actually doing something.

We may not have &quot;justice for all&quot; but this is more due to the inherent impossibility of applying most open-case absolute statements to the real world. You'd done well enough in presenting a logical, if unfocused, criticism up until you criticized people living in the real world for not being able to live up to one of the most stringentest absolutes in the whole structure of this country.<br>
<br>
&quot;...Liberty and Justice for All...&quot; is one of our Nation's highest aspirations, Fkin. Much like any good aspiration, it's something you strive for even though you'll likely never reach it. To say that a very ambitious aspiration such as this is nothing more than a &quot;cruel joke&quot; simply shows that your own deep cynicism has clouded even the basic understanding of human psychology on a mass scale.<br>
<br>
I won't even go into disputing your feigned incredulity as to why people are getting spun up over this Pledge issue. I will however point to the Establishment Clause as a lingual structure open to interpretation. This Nation really was founded under the auspice of faith in a higher power, such is reflected again and again in essays, books, and letters by the Framers. It is easily demonstrable that the majority of the Framers were deeply religious men. A very good case could be made for the Establishment Clause being meant to prevent the Govt from becoming involved in Sectarianism only, not in religion/faith as a whole. Still, it has been decided, occassionally by the Supreme Court but more freqeuntly by the Media and Atheists everywhere, that this is not the case. But, much like mankind cannot provide justice for &quot;all&quot;, neither can mankind perfectly interpret everything in the document that defines the United States of America.<br>
<br>
Still, as I've said previously, I agree with the decision made the 9th Circuit, as it stands, and due solely to the views expressed by those who signed the addition of &quot;under God&quot; to the Pledge in '54. I still submit that the timing was poor, and, worse, that the motivation for bringing up the suit in the first place was nothing more than callous self-aggrandizement. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

<br>
&lt;&quot;All&quot; is a special word. It ranks with such words as &quot;Every&quot; and Never. They're absolutes. Absolutes are damned hard to see in any way other than allegory, symbolism, etc.&gt;<br>
<br>
I was not talking about the word all on its own - this misses the point entirely. I was talking about liberty and justice for all (the implication being that it is equally applied) - CLEARLY this is not the case. It doesn't take many examples (or actually any I should think in this case though I am sure you might ask for some) - to see that liberty and justice are available in exact proportions to the amount of wealth and connections you have in this country. I am sorry you don't see this but its a fact. Poor people are convicted almost every day, usually because they have little in the way of decent representation, while the number of rich criminals in jail is few indeed. If you need a further explanation or statistics please feel free to ask but I don't think most people need an extensive refresher in this.<br>
<br>
&quot;We may not have &quot;justice for all&quot; but this is more due to the inherent impossibility of applying most open-case absolute statements to the real world.

Actually no I didn't say that. I did say that mouthing these words hasn't helped us achieve them though. Case in point - America has a huge problem with many types of crime and violent crime in particular. Though the average Japanese citizen may or may not have (this is arguable of course since we are not talking absolutes) the same degree of absolute liberty most Americans enjoy - they have an extremely effective justice system - there are lots of numbers out there feel free to check them out - but their percentage of unsolved crimes in a fraction of what ours is. Their incidence of crime in all categories and particularly in violent crime is MUCH lower. I wont address the second half of that paragraph because it is simply a weak ad hominum attack and really has nothing to do with the matter at hand.<br>
<br>

While I myself am a christian and believe in god - I don't believe forcing other people to say the words 'under god', have prayers in school or the rest of the pledge and trying to brainwash little kids is a good choice - I suppose that is where we are different.<br>

<br>
Nice way to start a rebuttal, especially considering you later accuse me, falsely for the most part, of ad hominem attacks. <br>
<br>
For the record:<br>
<br>
1) Bulvai is an historical name from northern Europe. I chose to spell it phonetically for simplicity's sake. It was at the end of a long list of historical names attempted in sequence. Were it an attempt at plagiarism or homage paid to the book, the toon named such would've been a warrior, not a shaman as it is. <br>
<br>
2) Were I strictly plagiarizing, I would've used the proper spelling (Bulwyf, from what I recall, and there was a half-elf warrior on Quell for quite sometime with that name).<br>
<br>
3) Where does someone using a name like &quot;Fkin6666&quot; have anywhere to stand in criticizing anyone else's name?<br>
<br>
&quot;You missed the plot again but I will respond to all your 'points,' most of which are dressed up as valid argument but none of which contain much in the way of a rebuttal to what I said.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are slightly correct. Your original post contained such little substance that I had little worthwhile to directly rebut.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was not talking about the word all on its own - this misses the point entirely.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, this does not miss the point in the slightest. You were assaulting that phrase because you do not personally see liberty and justice being applied to everyone. Or are you so crass as to state that you think it is applied to no one at all and you are positing that no one enjoys either liberty or justice? Is this why the phrase needs to go, according to you? <br>
<br>
&quot;I was talking about liberty and justice for all (the implication being that it is equally applied) - CLEARLY this is not the case.&quot;<br>
<br>
And? Why should justice be equally applied? We have Judges for a reason. Each case must decided on its' own merit. Should an offense deserve more punishment for one person than another, so be it, the Judge will weigh options and decide. To do else is to reduce our judicial system to a simple mechanical process, a Kangaroo Court.<br>
<br>
We have examples here in the States of justice being &quot;equally&quot; applied. It's such lovely things as mandatory sentencing for drug offenses and the Three Strikes program. I am not a Liberal guy, but even I can see that a first time offender with a pocket full of LSD does not merit 20 years in jail. The state of California does, though.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry you don't see this but its a fact. Poor people are convicted almost every day, usually because they have little in the way of decent representation, while the number of rich criminals in jail is few indeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
While I am broadly disgusted by the actions of a certain high profile few in avoiding their just fate, I am not cynical enough to decry the whole concept. It is also conceivable, if one uses a shred of logic, that there are far more poor people in the world, thus it would logically follow that there would be more poor people incarcerated. <br>
<br>
&quot;Actually no I didn't say that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, yes, you did. The structure of the line I was referring did not mate it to your overall argument. Your denigration of the &quot;justice for all&quot; line was seperate, logically and semantically, from the reference to &quot;mouthing the words&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I did say that mouthing these words hasn't helped us achieve them though.<br>
<br>
Really? And what logical proof do you offer for this? Can you honestly state that a particular portion of the socialization of our youth does not add to the overall effect? So, you've done or have read studies wherein school children were kept from stating the Pledge and still turned out to be model citizens? I'm not saying that these words have some magical effect or that they do generate positive feelings for the country, but I somehow do not see how you are making this statement that the have no effect at all. There simply is no basis shown for it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Case in point - America has a huge problem with many types of crime and violent crime in particular. Though the average Japanese citizen may or may not have (this is arguable of course since we are not talking absolutes) the same degree of absolute liberty most Americans enjoy - they have an extremely effective justice system - there are lots of numbers out there feel free to check them out - but their percentage of unsolved crimes in a fraction of what ours is. Their incidence of crime in all categories and particularly in violent crime is MUCH lower.&quot; <br>
<br>
Apples and Oranges, Fkin. Japan is a fraction of the size of the USA, with a fraction of the populace. It is also far more homogenous racially, liguistically, and culturally. This means that its' society is radically different from ours and thus not a good comparison. There are very few analogues the the USA in this world, one of those few being the Russian Federation, and even it is different enough racially, liguistically, culturally, and historically as to not warrant close and accurate comparison. <br>
<br>
Were Australia to have a population base as broad and numerous as ours, I'd say it would be a good comparison. Their history and culture are similar enough.<br>
<br>
As far as the relative liberty of the Japanese citizenry, I've no basis to dispute or believe that statement. I'm not Japanese. I do not live in Japan. I do however remember many times when my Japanese grandmother used to comment about how many choices she had here in America, and about how big everything was, wide open, people could do anything they wanted, be anything they wanted, etc. My grandmother was from the island of Hokkaido and moved in the 40's after marrying my grandfather, so perhaps she wasn't aware of the Japan to which you are referring. <br>
<br>
&quot;I wont address the second half of that paragraph because it is simply a weak ad hominum attack and really has nothing to do with the matter at hand.<br>
<br>
Nice. First, it is &quot;ad hominem&quot;. Second, an &quot;ad hominem&quot; attack is when I choose to assault the arguer instead of the argument. For example, this would be like saying that your argument is invalid because you have a 6666 after your name and are thus inbred and possessed of bad hair. If you go back and reread what I said, you will realize that I was not assaulting the arguer, I was still assaulting the arguement. Calling your argument unfocused was not, in any way, shape, or form, an ad hominem assault. It was simply calling it as I see it. If you go back and reread your post critically and objectively, it was rather unfocused.<br>
<br>
The latter half of the posted quote did actually have something to do with the entire argument, by the way. It segued into the next paragraph and set up the idea of high aspirations, argued in the next paragraph.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is basically another personal attack and doesn't say anything about the matter at hand - I think should go without saying that mouthing the pledge does nothing at all towards achieving the aspirations it asserts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, you confuse what is not an attack for a personal attack. Your post was incredibly cynical in tone. I suggest again a critical and objective revisiting of your own material.<br>
<br>
I also posit again that you've nothing to support your statement that the Pledge has, or does not have, an effect on our National aspirations. Why should it go without saying?<br>
<br>
In point of fact, your very argument assaulting the inclusion of the phrase &quot;and justice for all&quot; leads me to believe that you feel cheated without these things and perhaps strive harder to bring such into your own life, if only by arguing the point on flame boards. I would say that the Pledge has had an effect on you.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok this is an interesting paragraph. It starts off with another personal attack&quot; <br>
<br>
My, you are touchy. How is pointing out the tone of a portion of your post a personal attack. Did my verbage escape you? You were lightly feigning surprise and amusement that this topic was even being discussed. I called this &quot;feigned incredulity&quot; simply because I would not be so crass as to assume that you really would be surprised about any minutiae we might collectively discuss on this board. <br>
<br>
Far from being an attack, this was paying you a shred of respect. Obviously no good deed goes unpunished. <br>
<br>
&quot;then proceeds to assert a deeper understanding of the motivations of the framers of the constitution that the supreme court.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, you assume much. I presented an alternative viewpoint and proferred the idea that the Supreme Court is not infallible. Were the Supreme Court so infallible, the addition of the &quot;under God&quot; line would not have made it through the nearly 50 years it has been in place, nor would a profusion of other outright bad decisions have been made throughout their history.<br>
<br>
As an aside, please do not confuse this as an assault on the Court. Humans are fallible, and capable of forgiveness as a result. <br>
<br>
&quot;It then finishes with an attack on the faceless media and atheists, and a general restatement of what I did not say about the word 'all'.&quot; <br>
<br>
Again with the &quot;attack&quot; thing. Trust me, were I assaulting someone, I'd say it. All I was saying was that the Establishment Clause, like everything else in the Constitution, has been held up for interpretation. <br>
<br>
As an aside, again, this is more of an ad hominem attack than anything I wrote. I, at the least, had the decency to refute your statements instead of simply quoting them and then deriding them. <br>
<br>
&quot;Bravo it may be a luke warm flame but its worth no 'points' in an argument and has nothing to do with the topic per se.&quot;<br>
<br>
LOL, this was not even a luke warm flame. If you think it was a flame at all, might I direct you to read some of Salta or Ravenark's less family friendly ones as a better idea of what a flame should be.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you are trying to convince people that your point of view is valid and that you really are ok with other people's belief systems - labeling all athiests and others who don'g agree with you wont win you many converts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Your assumptions have become impressive in their breadth and lack of connection to any shred of reality. <br>
<br>
1) I am not trying to convince anyone of anything in this thread. I am arguing a point or three. There is a difference. <br>
<br>
2) I am not trying to gain converts. See point #1<br>

3) I am generally okay with other's belief systems and have not said otherwise. I challenge anyone to show me where I have denigrated a belief system. I may denigrate an indivdual believer, an establishment dedicated to a belief system, or the trappings thereof, but I rarely deride a belief system in itself. Again, there is a difference.<br>
<br>
4) What, precisely, did I label the atheists and the media?<br>
<br>
5) What bearing does the above quote have on anything. I'd say &quot;unfocused&quot; again, but I believe I've used it enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;While I myself am a christian and believe in god - I don't believe forcing other people to say the words 'under god', have prayers in school or the rest of the pledge and trying to brainwash little kids is a good choice - I suppose that is where we are different.&quot;<br>
<br>
Good for you. I'm not Christian, and don't profess any sort of faith or belief in anything, much to my disappointment. I have also stated early on in this argument that the 9th Circuit Court made the right call. Did you read some part of my post that I didn't? I never said a single thing about the &quot;under God&quot; line in reference to your post. <br>
<br>
Reciting a Pledge and brainwashing are a bit different. If you cannot see this statement as true, try researching MK-ULTRA, the USSR under Stalin, Chairman Mao, Orwell's 1984, or Psycholinguistics practiced by Revivalist ministers. Reciting a Pledge once a day is socialization and might just help in building good citizens.<br>
<br>
The best part about this is the last line. I gave a better argument as to why the 9th Circuit was correct far earlier in the discussion, and I am somehow on the side of the &quot;under God&quot; crowd.<br>
<br>
Imaginative. <br>

If the term &quot;under god&quot; in the pledge offends your religious beliefs; how can the &quot;in GOD we trust&quot; found on all American currency fail to do so; and if thats true then you are obviously (in my opinion) not being true to your religion every time you use American currency, you are in fact knowingly practicing hypocrticism. Furthermore it is my opinion that if you don't want to pledge allegiance, if the allegiance to this country offends you well there are many many other places to go live no one is twisting your arm and making you stay here. But either way, if these terms violate your rights, either stand up for your beliefs in whole or give up your cash cause you cant have it both ways and remain true to your beliefs. <br>

In response to:<br>
&quot;I'm sure there are people who want that off the back of their money but until then they have to live with it.&quot;<br>
------------<br>
<br>
No one HAS to live with it.. pack up your stuff and go some place else, because this is America you happen to have the right, and freedom, to leave any time.<br>
<br>
And please people, spare me the &quot;how unamerican that statement is&quot; I am simply pointing out that, in my opinion, no one is forced to hypocritically use currency that must offend their beliefs, nor are they forced to &quot;live with it&quot; here.  <p><center><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Khelandra/fullsize/Newestsig.jpg></center>

It was shot down dead as the court said that one does not imply belief in God by using money. One merely uses it. <br>
<br>
The comparison here is that, by having the phrase &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge and having govt schools ask children to recite the Pledge, we are tacitly forcing the child to express implicitly some level of belief in the existence of some God. <br>
<br>
When you use money however, you are handing off an item that merely has an implicit belief in God emblazoned upon it, and this does not constitute a statement on your part. You did not, after all, write those words, and do not necessairly intend the transfer of cash as some sort of odd proseltyzing.<br>
<br>
I'm not terribly conversant on the logic used in that decision and am merely attempting to relate the gist of it from memory. Please don't consider this a statement of my position on the &quot;In God we trust&quot; line. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

<br>
I am not religious... but that is besides the point.<br>
<br>
Correct me if I am wrong...<br>
<br>
Are you not using the Lords name in vain?<br>
<br>
Is the pledge not suggesting that God is only on America's side?<br>
<br>
When people say God Bless America?  Do they mean for God to bless the United States as a whole regardless of what each individual American has done in their life.. or better yet.. Bless America and no other country because they aren't worth being blessed?<br>
<br>
I sincerely hope they take &quot;Under God&quot; out of the pledge... it doesn't make sense to have it in there.  I use to stand for the pledge and recite it when I was in school.. although I wouldn't say &quot;under god&quot;.. because I didn't believe that God had anything to do with it.  Actually when I was in elementary.. they use to pick students to recite the pledge to the whole school over the intercom.  I left &quot;under God&quot; out of it.. most thought I'd made a mistake.. heh.<br>
<br>
I am surprised to see so many people against it being taken out.  Is it so troublesome to those that don't want to have it taken it out.  Does it change the value of the pledge?  I do not think so.<br>
<br>
The pledge is Allegiance to the United States.. not to God or &quot;under God&quot; for that matter.<br>
<br>
Do you want to be the parent of the child that comes home and ask who &quot;God&quot; is?  And what it means... if you wanted your child to believe in something other then God?  <br>
<br>
To a child.. it does suggest that God is on America's side.  For we pledge to our country in his name. <p><a href="http://bound-by-honor.tripod.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/boundbyhonor/images/AlleyneSig.jpg" border=0></a></p><b>~.~  51st Ranger of Tunare  ~.~</b></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=361.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=361.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=361.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=361.topic&start=81&stop=83>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=361.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=361.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=361.topic&index=60><img src=http://quellious-collective.com/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=361.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=361.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=361.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=361.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm23">Archives-General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm24">Archives-Flames</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
