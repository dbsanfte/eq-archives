Well, i do now, after being screwed over more times then i can count by ADD, and hearing about more people then i can count getting screwed by you, my &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; that i normally give people .... is gone.<br>
<br>
Just as more explanation, as i was at all the raids that Ivyy talked about -<br>
<br>
HoT - As i remember we had a force, just slightly before ADD, but we rolled for who got to fight near the entrance, so ADD went into the tunnel, which is fine, but i would like some respect of a camp, at least 5 times, sometimes without even asking in OOC, an ADD person would open the door to &quot;join&quot; their raid party, thus causing the slaughter of our whole raid as 4 drakes come storming in to kill us. Also one time someone just ran into the guardian(must have a death wish) , realizing she was dieing, for some reason she decided to run through our raid, bringing the guardian onto us, when we were still rezzing from teh last whip ADD caused.<br>
<br>
Yael - we both had significant forces at roughly the same time, and we(AOA) asked for a roll, to see who got, or at least got the first try at Yael, to the best of my knowledge, ADD refused to roll, from then on it became a race, evidently. we used a non kos dwarf to drag down my coth mage and we cothed our raid party to the drop off, we were still preping for yael at the waterfall, when ADD, probably in a rush knowing where we were, rushed in to get yael, having a smaller raid party, and having about their entire raid party suck DTs, after we made sure they were all dead(*notice the not jumping in after someone aggros*), we buffed up, dropped down and kill yael, then even though ADD had been an ass (*shock*) we rezed at least their cleric, then went on our way and did the ranger mob a few times.<br>
<br>
Sever - this is a &quot;hot&quot; topic atm, so i wont go into it, and state just the facts, AoA is first force their with the numbers, we announce we are pulling him in 5min, we get a &quot;good luck&quot; in OOC, we send our puller to go grab him, ro see right that second, an ADD member going in and aggroing him, taking him to their camp, they did beat us to the mob, thats why we have let it go, but we slowed down and made sure we were ready for the pull, because we heard &quot;good luck&quot; and didnt think they would try , unless we all died, i guess we thought too much of them.<br>
<br>
All these things, plus this PoF thing, which they obviously wronged someone, i dont care who pulled or what not, cause Radiant was in the plane first, and that fact makes all other arguements, gravy, all these things, make me have an eternal distrust, disliking, and almost a hatred for anyone in ADD, if you dont like me thinking about you this way, then LEAVE, as long as you have &lt;At Death's Door&gt; near your name, i will not trust you, group with you, piss on you if your on fire, so just consider what your labeling yourself with when you wear that guild tag, cause i really doubt i am the only one who thinks this way.<br>
<br>
p.s. /salute the ADD chanter offering if GMs will to offer her shissar head, it is noble, and gives you respect, but i am afraid nothing anymore can give your guild respect, in my eyes.<br>

<br>
Im sorry the Radiant enchanter got screwed over with Shissar, even though it seems Qin has fixed that. But id just like to know why ADD is supposed to just bend over and recieve all this @#%$ from other guilds (need i say Ragefire) and when we do it to someone else, we get every single person flaming and hating us?<br>
<br>
We get screwed over so much by other guilds. In theory we got shissar the same way that SoTU got Ragefire off us a while back. And Radiant has twice now taken Ragefire from Grimoar. <br>
<br>
I really wish people would give us a break. Do you really think we'll let people walk over us? Just cus we dont take it to the flame boards every time we get screwed over doesnt mean we dont get screwed over. <br>
<br>
Maybe i should post every time we do get screwed by another guild. You'd have one at least every week.<br>
<br>
Ive probably repeated what everyone else in ADD has said, and i'll doubt it will make a difference because people are set on hating us without giving any thought to our side of the story. Luckily i wont see 98% of you because all you seem to do is come to this board and rant about us instead of playing.<br>
<br>
And Catt, we were clearing fear as soon as we zoned in. There were tons of mobs still up cus we were AEing them, so stop talking about @#%$ you dont know, whoever you are.<br>

What irks me is that you so boldly KNOW what happened at yael even though I was the person doing the talk ... and u will try to say you know better? I talked to a paladin not to a druid ... and I proposed roll which he refused ... if u want to look again at my story about that read a couple pages back and talk to that Paladin of yours about it before you post or simply have him post because you have NO idea what we talked about and are hardly the ruling power to judge who said what and when. I refuse to be called a liar from a person who has NO way of even knowing what was going on there. I remember to have done negotiation in /tell not in /ooc.<br>
<br>
Also as a general note ... hardly anyone has any right to state FACT when he wast tere and even if he was there only the person doing the talking has any juridistiction to say how it went. That goes both to my guild to everyone who seems to KNOW exactly what was said and done at some time even though they received their information second or even third hand and werent even there. If u get ur info from flame posts id like you to reconsider what quality that info is going to be. Usage of word cocsuck and similar doesnt make something true.<br>
<br>
Damn i keep getting dragged here by ppl who have no idea yet they know all the facts misteriously.<br>

I know Radiant was there for the whole week for Shaekee at least and Grimsoar wasn't.  I dunno it just seems crappy of me to go to the cleric who has been wasting their time in Skyfire right before Rage is going to spawn and then demand a random.  If anything, Grimsoar was trying to steal the camp from Radiant.  Radiant just complied with GM arbitration.  <p><Font Size = 1>

When there was a contested camp involving Shaekee and Grimsoar - both clerics asserted that they had been there all week. I know that Shaekee was there, however I cannot comment on Grimsoar's presence.  That is not to say that he was not there, I was not aware of his presence until the 5th or 6th day.  GM's were asked to arbitrate - they used a simple /random 100 to determine which of the two clerics would get the FIRST shot at Ragefire.  Shaekee rolled a 31, Grimsoar rolled a 30.<br>
<br>
HAD Shaekee's crew not been able to take down Ragefire, then that specific spawn instance would have become a FFA spawn.<br>
<br>
However, Shaekee's kill team <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DID</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> take down Ragefire and Shaekee did loot the epic component.  End of story.  Both Shaekee and Grimsoar agreed to abide by the GM's earlier decision - so for those who are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> STILL</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> not clear....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> At Death's Door were not KS'd by the group who were working towards Shaekee's epic.  Fate, in the form of a low roll by Grimsoar, was responsible for Grimsoar losing the first opportunity at Ragefire - NOT Kill Stealing by Radiant.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <p><img src = "http://www.protectorsofknowledge.com/images/TovarichJones.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font> <br> <br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.91<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
