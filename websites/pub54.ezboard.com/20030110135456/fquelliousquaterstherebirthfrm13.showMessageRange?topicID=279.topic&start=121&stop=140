Had Radiant not been first in the zone, would that make a difference?  Because it now sounds as if an ADD member was in first scouting and he spotted the mob and waited for forces to log on.  So an ADD member was in the zone first.  This has not been disputed by either side so it must be fact.<br>
<br>
2. Maybe the point is that you have to have a &quot;Raid Force&quot; in the zone first to clear it and such.  Oh ok.  So let's say that is the case.  Then Radiant was in the zone first.  Oops, wait a second.  Were they first in the zone because they rushed in (hence the multiple wipe outs they incurred) because Trist knew ADD was gathering forces just outside of Fear?  Did they rush in because Trist didn't want to have to come to an agreement of some sorts?  Did they rush in because Trist didn't want to have to roll were it to be petitioned?  (And yes, you CAN petition on issues in other zones.  I've done it myself and a GM will respond to the petition.)<br>
<br>
3.  So, because Radiant zoned in first, in a hurry, while an ADD officer was trying to work out a compromise with the Radiant leader, is this suifficient reason to say they owned the spawn?  Because if it is, then you are saying ADD had no right to it, because ADD chose to NOT rush in, but to rather attempt a negotiation BEFORE zoning in.   And if you are saying this, then you are saying that ADD should be punished because they tried to do the right thing before it became a competition and a fight between guilds.  You are also saying Radiant was first in the zone.  Which they weren't because it's been established that ADD had a scout in the zone l before anyone else.  (see #1 above)<br>
<br>
4.  Now that we have heard both sides of the story the picture becomes a little clearer.  First, what Trist posted originally is clearly one sided and only a small portion of the story.  He never mentions why he ordered Radiant to make a rush upon zoning in.  He never mentions that an ADD officer attempted negotiations other than to say Banelion told him ADD was going to engage.  Bane said this AFTER he attempted negotiations, was ignored and Radiant zoned in.<br>
<br>
5.  Trist said, &quot;Seeing that things were heating up, we kicked the raid into overdrive, pulling out the entire temple so that we could pull the Wraith. &quot;  Note these important words &quot;pulling out the ENTIRE&quot; temple&quot;.  This indicates that they rushed in and aggro'd the whole temple.  It also supports later testimony by Radiant members, stating that Trist and another Radiant member kited the whole temple so Bip would pull the Wraith.  <br>
<br>
Now, later in Trist's post he says &quot;Then they have the audicity to blame me for the train their puller brings into their camp.&quot;  <br>
<br>
So my question is this...How did Verbo get a train, when Trist and friend had already trained everything out of the temple and were kiting them?  Also, how does Trist know that ADD's &quot;puller brings a train into their camp&quot;?  I can only see one conclusion based on what's been presented...Trist knew there was a train in the ADD camp because he brought it.  What other conclusion can there be, based upon Trist's own statements and those of his guildmates?<br>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion if we are to believe 99% of what BOTH parties are saying then we can conclude the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Both guilds had one or more members in the zone spotting.<br>
<br>
2.  Both guilds gathered to take down Wraith at approximately the same time.<br>
<br>
3.  A negotiation was attempted.<br>
<br>
4. One guild rushed in, in an attempt to claim ownership and got wiped out not once, but twice.<br>
<br>
5. Both guilds eventually wound up in the zone competing for a mob that had not yet been engaged by EITHER party. (This is prior to either puller aggroing it.)<br>
<br>
6.  One guild attempted a very fast clearing of the mobs in order to get to the main target faster than the other guild that was still attempting to negotiate before, during and after they zoned in.<br>
<br>
7. One guild attempted to do this clearing extra quick by training and kiting numerous mobs out of harms way so their puller could pull the target mob.<br>
<br>
8. While this kiting was going on, both pullers for both guilds attempted to aggro the mob.  Not at the same time, and it is still unclear if each puller knew what the other was doing and who engaged first.<br>
<br>
9. When one puller got enough aggro to actually make the pull to their group, the other group's kiter chose to bring his train to the group that made the pull.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this case I clearly think there were &quot;wrongs&quot; by both parties.  Both parties went to extremes to ensure they got the mob.  One by rushing and kiting mobs away, and one by force of their occupation.  Neither party was entirely right and neither was entirely wrong.  Other than the train brought by the kiter, no official rules were broken, although rules of courtesy and sportsmanship were ignored.  However, one guild clearly offered a courtesy and sportsmanship resolution.  The same resolution they were forced to swallow several days earlier in another disputed spawn.<br>
<br>
Finally, since no one is going to flip-flop positions and concede to the other party, why not do like they used to do in the olden days?  Why not let the &quot;Kings&quot; (Leaders) of each guild chose 6 of their best &quot;Knights&quot;.  These 12 knights would then proceed to meet on the battlefield Arena and the last team with a live member wins the rights to the disputed item that was looted.<br>
<br>
NO RULES will exists for this fight, with one small exception. The one exception?  Once the fight commences no one can interfere in ANY WAY.  No heals, no buffs, no advice, no nothing.  Do all the buffing, strategizing, and preparing you want, before the fight.  Then leave em alone to fight for the honor of their guild.  Let the guild leaders choose those races and classes they think will survive the best.  All chosen &quot;knights&quot; must have been a guild member at the time of the disputed spawn.<br>
<br>
To ensure fairness and to resolve any disputes with the fight, each leader may chose ONE member of the OTHER guild, to act as a referee if a dispute should occur.  The two referee's will make a binding decision.  Or better yet, invite a GM to attend and resolve any disputes with the fight.<br>
<br>
I bet no one agrees to this, because it's easier to cry and whine than it is to work out a solution.  What better solution is there, than to have a guild war of sorts?  In fact, this is how Verant should settle all spawn disputes.  Turn on guild war for the disputing parties and let em go at it until it's decided. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
everytime something happens  with anyone, us or otherwise  here comes master salta and the other dimwits preaching thier words of wisdom  and how their view of the world on eq is the right one.  give it a rest and grow up a little.<br>
  i wasnt there for this one and dont have all the facts here so im not chiming in on the incident, but im sure all you angels that posted  on the 6 previous pages always do things in the best interest of others and always play by pnp and with honor etc. <br>
 i haven't read through the 6 pages of trash here and not sure i have the time or patience other then for amusement, but if anyone has any trash talking to do about banelion  please take it up with me, im sure he wont trash talk or have alot to say on your level but i surely will on his behalf. <br>
hes a better player then most out there and plays with more honor then anyone i know almost to the point of being too nice or simply in character for his class though hes like that full time. <br>
dont bother on the boards i doubt ill be back i only came cause somone added link to a post about this, feel free to take it up in game in tells.<br>

The language and mentality of the people posting here as 'officers' of ADD proves Radiant's point far better than any log I could read.  With people like these 'officers' leading ADD, I have no hesitation in believing every story I hear about them.<br>
<br>
Banelion, you seem to be the only ADD officer here with intelligence and maturity. I suggest you examine your guild leadership a bit more closely.  I'm certainly not impressed with it. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=147233"_blank>Aillron Lifereaver</a>

<br>
1) If you had sent me a tell saying lets make a deal on a mob im already in zone to take i would ignore you myself. Lihum tells you , What are you %#$@*@ nuts? <br>
<br>
2) I am Co-Leader of Unruled Power and as one of my top officers Mipp has clearly stated previously you do rush other peoples' raids  IE: Hate Raid  IE: POG raid and thats just our guild and easily only a fast recollection <br>
<br>
3) Banelion , by your own epic post you admit that you gave no respect to the fact that Radiant was already there clearing the path to mob.Your spy just told you when the opportune time was to engage and take cleared mob sound about right ? You claim that you did all you could to follow PNP rules and what not. IMO you also admit, in your post that you intend basically to use the rules to your favor. That would be great. But please try and apply the right rule to the right situation. IMO rage and POF arent the same situation. Whereas you have a huge epic fight to get to a spawn, Versus one that spawns, say out in the open untouched. Clearly, the later would be fair game given the in zone force etc. Seems to me the second you Start &quot;clearing to&quot; a mob like that. YOU ARE ENGAGED and with the given force, should be allowed your attempt.  <br>
<br>
Facts are facts and clearly you will never win an argument on Quellious on QC or probably, just about anywhere in the EQ community.The actions of your guild on Quellious and Reputation will always take care of that even before your first word is even spoken<br>
<br>
The funny part of it is that you will be the undoing of yourselves and i cant wait till i hear of the glorious day when i hear the word that ADD is no more <br>
<br>
Full circle baby !<br>

<br>
Please name these horrible things you think I've done to people that are out of line.  The *only* time I've ever been accused of ksing someone was in oasis when Kurly and I tried to duo Cazel for the hell of it.  I charmed a sand giant that some druid claims to have been kiting and even though the mob was at full life I went back and c2ed him so there would be no bad blood.  I am such a horrible person for doing stuff like that, the GM's should ban me for my actions =X.  I make jokes about training people and ganking mobs that other guilds are attempting but I have yet to actually do anything like that.  I'm smart enough to realize that as a chanter I dont have the hp to properly train (*cough* Kefkah *cough*). <br>
<br>
So basically don't confuse my being an ass to people that deserve to be treated as such with being a dishonorable player.  I just don't play the game like that and I'm sorry that the people you associate yourself with don't play the same way. <p>Salta

Two wipeouts in fear, now thats a lot of time to get people back for wipeouts. I will tend to say Radiant was in Fear now for MORE Than just a hour before ADD. This is by your own words now.<br>

Yeah, both guilds ended up in the zone after Radiant cleared to the temple. Your arguement here holds no water. It would be like if Vis went and cleared all of FEAR and to have you run in and claim Cazic Thule. NOT gonna happen.<br>

Yeah right. You were like a freaking low predator. Sounds like to me the guild chat sounded like.. Hey guys lets let radiant clear to the mob and lets gank him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <br>

<br>
This is a common practice on guilds. If you get a lot of adds you have someone kite them while you kill them one by one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <br>
9. When one puller got enough aggro to actually make the pull to their group, the other group's kiter chose to bring his train to the group that made the pull.<br>

<br>
Your group should not have been in Fear. It was clearly Radiants zone at this point.<br>
<br>
Obviously ADD has no clear moral motives in the game. I hope next time when you enter a zone, clear all the way to a mob, I hope someone ganks him from you. OVER AND OVER AND OVER.<br>
<br>
What ADD did her is CLEARLY immoral to all the other players on the server. This has got to be one of the lowest NINJA KSINGS I've ever heard of.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   FACTS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1. Radiant clear the path.<br>
2. Radiant clear out the Temple.<br>
3. ADD Then STOLE a mob that Radiant had already Aggroed.<br>
<br>
Again, I hope the Server GM strips your guildmate of your epic.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1. Both guilds had one or more members in the zone spotting.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It is obvious that Radiant was there first.  For awhile they were there by your own guilds addmissions.<br>
<br>
Conclusion #1 == Lie<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 2. Both guilds gathered to take down Wraith at approximately the same time.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Radaint obviously cleared the path to the temple.  Many times have I seen the temple cleared in few pulls while a tagger peels a mob and pulls the mob back to the camp.  Raid PoF 101?<br>
<br>
Either way, Radiant cleared the way.  Not both Radiant and ADD.<br>
<br>
Conclusion #2 == Lie<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 3. A negotiation was attempted.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What do you expect? <br>
<br>
You were here first.  You cleared the way.  You engaged and pulled the wraith.  We want to negotiate. What's there to negotiate?<br>
<br>
Conclusion #3 == DUH!!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 4. One guild rushed in, in an attempt to claim ownership and got wiped out not once, but twice.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Have any clue how many times guilds 'wipe out' breaking in?  Do you have any clue that this is the hard part of breaking fear? /boggle.<br>
<br>
Conclusion #4 == DUH!!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 5. Both guilds eventually wound up in the zone competing for a mob that had not yet been engaged by EITHER party. (This is prior to either puller aggroing it.)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Do to your choice of getting into position for the 'gank'.<br>
<br>
Conclusion #5 == Quit following other guilds for an attempt to gank their pulls. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 6. One guild attempted a very fast clearing of the mobs in order to get to the main target faster than the other guild that was still attempting to negotiate before, during and after they zoned in.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What was your guild still doing there?  /boggle<br>
If another guild is there to KS you, get to the mob as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Conclusion #6 == DUH!!<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 7. One guild attempted to do this clearing extra quick by training and kiting numerous mobs out of harms way so their puller could pull the target mob.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ever see Lotus Cult clear fear?  Train after Train of mobs while peelers are pulling mobs off the train.  Very efficient way of clearing fear.  Very efficient way of clearing the temple.  <br>
<br>
Conclusion #7 == Read Raiding PoF 101<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 8. While this kiting was going on, both pullers for both guilds attempted to aggro the mob. Not at the same time, and it is still unclear if each puller knew what the other was doing and who engaged first.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
If you attempt at this point to aggro the mob your attempting to KS this mob.  At this time if you kill the mob you effectively KS'd the mob.  It was clearly Radiants zone and Radiants mob.<br>
<br>
Conclusion #8 == WTF are you still doing in this zone? <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 9. When one puller got enough aggro to actually make the pull to their group, the other group's kiter chose to bring his train to the group that made the pull.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Should read... When Bip agroed the Wraith, she pulled it.  Again, WTF is ADD still doing there?<br>
<br>
Conclusion #9 == ALL OF THE ABOVE<br>
<br>
As far as you now wanting to duel Radiant to ease your consience?  Whatever makes you feel better lol<br>

Asking a guild run by someone like Garaddor to play nice, show respect, follow rules etc (judging from his posts here and elsewhere) is like spitting in the wind. <br>
