I think we can all be great patriots no matter our religious preference and I would hope that all religious references can be removed from government some day, so as not to offend anyone.<br>
   We are all used to our Money saying in god we trust. I just wonder if it would be called unconstitutional if it was In allah we trust, or any other religious reference.<br>
   I think if you can look at an issue like this from someone Elses perspective you can see how it could be...uncomfortable. <br>
    In any case taking a religious reference out of the Pledge will not Weaken the strength of our great nation, and maybe more parents can be proud of thier children reciting it. <p>           Jubiley<br>

I might add that a minor in theology (particularly if it comes from an institution with a religious axe to grind means little).<br>
<br>
You have an MA in History and simple reading comprehension escapes you so often? Fkin, I didn’t say that you couldn’t agree with me. I said don’t agree with me if you won’t back it up well. I was specifically referring to a passage where your logic was essentially “Yer wrong, so there. Nyer,”.<br>
<br>
As to my minor in Theology, I mention it simply because my oh-so-secular university did not offer a degree in Theology, else I would’ve taken it. As to you having taken philosophy courses, good for you. Unfortunately they obviously did not work. Before you decide that you are a philosopher because you’ve taken a course or two, remember something important that an old friend of mine was fond of saying. “Just because you drive a truck, it don’t make you a trucker, and just because you hand someone a letter, it don’t make you a mailman.” <br>
<br>
So far, the only shred of evidence I’ve seen that you’ve ever set foot in a philosophy classroom was your (incorrect) usage of “ad hominem”. That’s first year Critical Thinking stuff, Fkin. How much philosophy work could you have done if you cannot understand the difference between a religion and a philosophy, between the trappings of faith and the faith itself? Try and see beyond face value for a change, or just give it a rest.<br>
<br>
&gt;I would also say the since the various followers of the various Hindo gods keep statues of the god they worship, adorn their bodies with decorations depending on which god they worship (such as the lines painted or tatooed on if you worship Vishnu), and lastly the differing precepts followed depending on which god you follow very definitely shows that these gods are worshipped for what they represent and not as a mask. <br>
<br>
You are beginning to show a pattern of not paying attention. Did I talk about practice? No, I talked about the underlying philosophy and theology that exists within, behind, and surrounding the Hindu belief system. Do not confuse ritual with belief, or theology with observational psychology. Bikers tattoo Harley logos on their arms. They aren’t monks. Baseball fans adorn their bodies with decorations based on what team they follow. They aren’t priests. These are trappings.<br>
<br>
&gt;It is also clear that you feel free to discount widely used concepts if they dont agree with your own twisted logic. I am sorry but its VERY clear that Buddism falls under the definition of religion, and unlike YOUR definition my definition has an actual basis in not only conventional definition and usage but actual accepted meaning. Sure I am sure you have your own radical splinter group beliefs, and much like the flat earth people you are willing to argue your view and muddy the discussion with various broad statements of psuedo fact, but the fact remains, in many cases I addressed all of your points with references and examples, you never responded with much in the way of anything past generalities.<br>
<br>
Comparing me to Flat Earthers? Nice ad hominem, Slick. Still, Flat Earthers can be a helluva lot of fun.<br>
<br>
Actually, my definition was set early in the discussion to separate a belief system with godhead from a belief system without godhead. If you look in a generic dictionary and find a simple definition that satisfies you, please do not expect someone else to accept it when they choose to speak more precisely about the topic than you do. I am not interested in intellectual laziness, and will not coddle such simply because you choose to regard a simplistic, pluralist, and basic definition as the gospel. <br>
<br>
If you look at your doctor and tell her, “My arm hurts”, she is going to ask you to be more specific. This is the same idea. You say religion and expect it to cover every single faith out there, yet your definition is so poor that sports can be considered religions. Your definition is too broad, get over it. Nothing is twisted about defining something more precisely.<br>
<br>
Insofar as not responding with anything but generalities, what do you call my questions?  Where are your facts, Fkin?<br>
<br>
&amp;#61656; I also have visited Buddhist temples in the Seattle area and listen to the Dahli Lama speak on two separate occasions there. It simply amazes me that one person can seriously disregard the actual definition of a word, the conventional usage, and the accepted typical meaning of a word (in this case religion) and propose their own radically different definition and expect to be taken seriously - astounding. Again, Buddhism and its practice is filled with references to temples, monks and monestaries and it is considered a religion and a religious way of life inherent in its very definition. Again - straight from the dictionary - note well point 2.<br>
<br>
Reread the definition and my deconstruction of it. It is too broad. Football is not a religion, but it is pursued with zeal and dedication. Colleges are called temples of learning, but are not religious institutes. Prison are institutions, but prisoners are not monks. You confuse the trappings of religion with religion.<br>
<br>
&gt;1 The teaching of Buddha that life is permeated with suffering caused by desire, that suffering ceases when desire ceases, and that enlightenment obtained through right conduct, wisdom, and meditation releases one from desire, suffering, and rebirth. <br>
<br>
Yes, agreed. I can scour the net for quotes from the Buddha too. Unlike you, when I post them, I actually try to explain how they relate to the discussion at hand.<br>
<br>
&gt;2 The religion represented by the many groups, especially numerous in Asia, that profess varying forms of this doctrine and that venerate Buddha. <br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
You are not paying attention again. Reverence is not worship. There is a difference. I can revere Winston Churchill as a great speaker and great man. I can revere his teachings. This does not mean that I worship him. The Buddha is treated similarly in the texts. He was a great man and deserves reverence. He was not a godhead.<br>
<br>
Do me a favor, please. Next time that you decide that I, or one of the many other people around here that you’ve accused of the same crime, “miss the point”, explain it. While there is no evidence of it hereabouts, you might actually have a valid point about this issue. I’d hate to think that there is a good idea buried deep inside you and it cannot escape because of oppressor Bulvai.<br>

 Most of the rest of what you said is just another personnal attack [the comprehension section] (along with the other person  eldaric or whatever his name was). The fact of the matter is all of your responces have been for the most part missquotes or out of context quotes that quite deliberately do not address the point at hand in any given section. As an example - I gave 3 examples of religious practices that my Hindu friends use - you picked out one of these three and declared that these do not fit in your own definition of worship - lets once again see if conventional thinking agrees with you Bulvai - your track record on knowing definintions thus far is somewhat lacking to say the least.<br>
<br>
Religion -<br>
<br>
&quot;<br>
1 - Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. <br>
2 - A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. <br>
3 - The life or condition of a person in a religious order. <br>
4 - A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. <br>
5 - A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. <br>
<br>
&quot;<br>
 Well all I can say is once again your particular narrow usage doesnt appear to bear the weight of actual scruitiny. Its very obvious that not only the three easily observed practices I described clearly fufills the above requirements. In addition it is also clear that the practices of Buddhists also fufil the common dictionary definintion. I suppose its too bad that it appears that you wasted a perfectly good college education and cant seem to actually express the basic framework of what you claim is your actual specialty field. It is also clear contrary to your assertions that while not everyone here agrees with my particular predilections, they dont agree with you either. Heck lets make a short list of people who should be offended by your definition of not having a proper religion because they dont worship an identifyable monotheistic god-head. Buddhists, Hindus (yes hindus contrary to what you say I will get the definition shortly), american idian cultures (all of which were either clearly polytheistic or had shinto like spirit beliefs), followers of the beliefs of shinto, and most of the other minor non christian religions. Thats a lot of people to denigrate congratulations.<br>
<br>
Hinduism -<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
A diverse body of religion, philosophy, and cultural practice native to and predominant in India, characterized by a belief in reincarnation and a supreme being of many forms and natures, by the view that opposing theories are aspects of one eternal truth, and by a desire for liberation from earthly evils<br>
<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
First of all the section starts off and says there are differing beliefs here - I pointed this out. You claim that all the various forms are but masks. That perhaps is your point of view but followers of Vishnu might not agree with you lets check.<br>
<br>
Vishnu<br>
<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
One of the principal Hindu deities, worshiped as the protector and preserver of worlds. Vishnu is often conceived as a member of the triad including also Brahma and Shiva.<br>
<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
Ah - clarity - it appears there are multiple identifyable dietys here. Grats of twisting someone else's beliefs to suit your own needs.<br>
<br>
At this point I think the point has been well made, so I dont think I really need to goto sources over and over to proove that my approaches while they made not be perfect, seem to match up with facts to a much larger measure than yours do - have a good one.<br>

<br>
Ah, Greek thought. Have you heard of the Socratic Method? I've attempted to use it extensively through our discussion. You've consistently failed to respond.<br>
<br>
&gt;Most of the rest of what you said is just another personnal attack [the comprehension section] (along with the other person eldaric or whatever his name was). The fact of the matter is all of your responces have been for the most part missquotes or out of context quotes that quite deliberately do not address the point at hand in any given section.

<br>
Misquotes or out of context quotes? No, sorry Fkin, I usually tend to respond to each distinct paragraph and then move on. I do not quote paragraphs that I do not respond to as it would be a waste of bandwidth, something we are both horribly guilty of at this point.<br>
<br>
I did not pick out three examples and say they do not fit my definition, I picked out three trappings that you mistakenly thought to be signs of polytheism.<br>
<br>
As far as definitions go, you've proven merely that you can handle a basic search engine and the cut and paste function on your computer. Your ability to read into a definition and understand it's limitations are, however, not evident. I explained, in great detail, why your chosen definition was inexact. You chose not to notice.<br>
<br>
&lt;snip a repost of your earlier definition&gt;<br>
<br>
Do you really think that repetition will prove your point? Your definition was inexact previously, and fails to be any more precise now. I will not go through the pointless exercise of showing how, by your definition, football is a religion.<br>
<br>
&gt;Well all I can say is once again your particular narrow usage doesnt appear to bear the weight of actual scruitiny. Its very obvious that not only the three easily observed practices I described clearly fufills the above requirements. In addition it is also clear that the practices of Buddhists also fufil the common dictionary definintion. <br>
<br>
Certainly, the practices of Buddhists fulfill the basic pluralist definition of a religion, so do Sado-masochists practicing an S&amp;M lifestyle.<br>
<br>
1 - Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. <br>
<br>
Listen to a submissive describe their dom. The dom is the governor of the submissives universe and is utterly revered.<br>
<br>
2 - A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. <br>
<br>
If there is a lifestyle more into institutionalized living, I've not seen it.<br>
<br>
3 - The life or condition of a person in a religious order. <br>
<br>
Subs and doms both live spartan existences, given over wholly to discipline and order, mimicing well, in  twisted reflection, the life of religious asceticism and flagellation. <br>
<br>
4 - A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. <br>
<br>
The Marquis de Sade is a definite spiritual leader/teacher for this sector of society.<br>
<br>
5 - A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. <br>
<br>
Well, I think the comparison is self-evident given the lengths to which S&amp;M types will go to satisfy their urges.<br>
<br>
So, what you are saying is that sado-masochism is, by your definition, a religion, right?<br>
<br>
&gt;I suppose its too bad that it appears that you wasted a perfectly good college education and cant seem to actually express the basic framework of what you claim is your actual specialty field. <br>
<br>
Actually, I've not let it go to waste. I've done quite well in maintaining this argument with you. You simply fail to see it.<br>
<br>
&gt;It is also clear contrary to your assertions that while not everyone here agrees with my particular predilections, they dont agree with you either. <br>
<br>
Really? Not to be a populist, but I've seen more folks here looking askance at thee than me.<br>
<br>
&gt;Heck lets make a short list of people who should be offended by your definition of not having a proper religion because they dont worship an identifyable monotheistic god-head. Buddhists, <br>
<br>
If a Buddhist is offended by lil ole me, he's not much of a Buddhist. The Pillars of Widsom pretty much speak out against being offended by anything, and Buddhist scholarly work is very serious about arguing such points. Scholarly debate is one of the major activities in Buddhist temples.<br>
<br>
&gt;Hindus (yes hindus contrary to what you say I will get the definition shortly), <br>
<br>
Hindus have a godhead. I believe I've already spoken of it. You must've missed it in all the personal attacks.<br>
<br>
&gt;american idian cultures (all of which were either clearly polytheistic or had shinto like spirit beliefs), followers of the beliefs of shinto, and most of the other minor non christian religions. <br>
<br>
Hmm, I don't believe I've said anywhere that pantheistic or polytheistic religions are not religions, merely that Buddhism isn't. I believe, by the very nature of the pantheistic faiths having many little godhead and being belief systems, they fit quite well into my definition of a religion. <br>
<br>
You fell asleep in class again, didn't you?<br>
<br>
&gt;Thats a lot of people to denigrate congratulations.<br>

<br>
&quot;Hinduism -<br>
&quot;A diverse body of religion, philosophy, and cultural practice native to and predominant in India, characterized by a belief in reincarnation and a supreme being of many forms and natures, by the view that opposing theories are aspects of one eternal truth, and by a desire for liberation from earthly evils&quot;<br>
<br>
Right, you boil all of the 4000 collective years of Hindu thought and religion into three frikken sound bites and expect people to think that you have a clue? Would you like me to give you good sources to check?<br>
<br>
I cannot believe that you are so crass as to attempt to support your points with these blurbs from what is essentially &quot;Everything you wanted to know about Hinduism in one easy lesson&quot;. Show some respect, man.<br>
<br>
Sitting on a shelf above my desk as I type this is a book titled &quot;A Survey on hinduism&quot; by Klaus Klostermaier (ISBN 0-88706-809-X). It's a damned good book, about 650 pages long of small type. 650 pages, and it is a &quot;survey&quot;. I will use this text to quote from as it is very understandable. Please understand also that I am entering these notes by hand, not simply cutting and pasting from some poor pastiche of basic world religion.<br>
<br>
Let's try a quote from this source from page 125 - &quot;About a score of different Sanskrit words are rendered by the one English word God&quot; (please note that this follows up nicely on my earlier arguemtn about the generic nature of the English word &quot;God&quot;), &quot;We have to look at some of them in order to find out how the Hindus can at one and the same time have many gods and believe in One God&quot;<br>
<br>
Same page - &quot;F. Max Miller was struck by the evident fact that in a number of hymns the god to whom the song was addressed was praised as the only one, the supreme, the greatest, and that praise was not restricted to one and the same god, but given to various gods in various hymns. This did not conform to the classical notion of polytheism, so Muller coined the new term henotheism (from the Greek term henos, = &quot;one&quot;),&quot;<br>
<br>
Various gods are called the supreme and only god in different hymns. This is because those various gods are all the same, as we will see in later quotes.<br>
<br>
Page 127 - &quot;Much more important than the variable figure of the Deva (Roy note - Deva is used to refer to any number of celestial entities) was the basic underlying potency of which the Devas were only expressions and manifestations,&quot;<br>
<br>
In my previous argument, I used the term &quot;masks&quot; for simplicity.<br>
<br>
The text goes on to talk of Indra as High god on page 128 &quot;Only if Indra is understood as a symbol and manifestation of the High God do the attributes given to him makes sense, especially since the same attributes are given to various Devas, the same deeds are ascribed to  Agni, to Soma, to Varuna and others. (Roy note: quotes here appear in the text) &quot;They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni, and he is heavenly winged Garutman. To what is One, sages give many a title.&quot;. Indra is only one of the names of the Savior God. The Supreme was first, and only under specific circumstances did he receive the name of Indra. The Supreme is nameless; men give names to him, variously describing him in categories taken from cosmic events, from history, or from their own experience,&quot;<br>
<br>
The same god keeps having different names throughout the history of the religion. The people realize this, yet still worship their own particular mask on the One God.<br>
<br>
Page 132 quotes the Upanisad, likely as important a work to the Hindus as the Bible is to Christians - &quot;In a dialogue, in the Brhadarankaya-Upanisad, Yajnavalkya is asked the crucial question, the &quot;kati devah&quot;. How many are the Devas? His first answer is a quotation from the Vedic text, &quot;Three hundred and three and three thousand and three.&quot; Pressed on, he reduces the number first to thirty three, then to six, then to three, to two, to one and a half, and finally to one. Asked Which is the one Deva? he answer, &quot;The Prajna (Roy note: breath, life). The Brahman. He is called Tyat (Roy Note: that).&quot;<br>
<br>
Later on the same page - &quot;Brahman, untranslatable, identified with the soul of everything, with the creator and maintainer, of the world, with the inner principle of the universe - Brahman becomes the word around which the loftiest religious speculation has revolved for thousands of years, and is still the term for the supreme being.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Brahman is the sole &quot;entity&quot; extent in the Hindu faith. All else are but shadows, mask, symbols, and manifestations.<br>
<br>
(Fkin)&gt;&quot;One of the principal Hindu deities, worshiped as the protector and preserver of worlds. Vishnu is often conceived as a member of the triad including also Brahma and Shiva.&quot;<br>
<br>
From page 133 - &quot;Hindu texts do indeed speak of the triad (Roy note: Also called the Trimurti) of Brahma as the creator, Visnu as the preserver, and Siva as the destroyer, fulfilling all the functions of the One God, but all those texts belong to to one of the traditions in which the Supreme is identical with one of those names and the three seperate names are but different aspects of the same being.&quot;<br>
<br>
This quote needs no explanation as to how it counters the article you quoted. How can you possibly think that anything so simple would possess any of the depth due a tradition as old as Hinduism?<br>
<br>
I am mortified that you would seek to boil down the world's oldest religion into &quot;Hinduism for Dummies&quot;, and then present it as support.<br>
<br>
&gt;Ah - clarity - it appears there are multiple identifyable dietys here. Grats of twisting someone else's beliefs to suit your own needs.<br>
<br>
You claim clarity when you are quoting the Cliff Notes version of Hinduism. You are sorely mistaken and would do well to educate yourself in Hinduism prior to making such poorly thought out assertions.<br>
<br>
&gt;At this point I think the point has been well made, so I dont think I really need to goto sources over and over to proove that my approaches while they made not be perfect, seem to match up with facts to a much larger measure than yours do - have a good one.<br>
<br>
The only point you have proven is that your research ability is as weak as your argumentary skill. I have trouble believing that anyone not seeking to gravely insult would so crassly trivialize 4000 years of intense scholarly debate, faith, and history such as you have. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

Interesting.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course thats logical.  LOGICALLY there is a parrelel between bowing your head in prayer and pummeling someone to death.<br>
<br>
I SAID &quot;If your notion of tolerance is such that you can claim to be peaceful with it only if you dont see it then how tolerant are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
The reason your parrelel is invalid is cause I ADMIT intolerance to the things you mentioned.   Looked at my quote again.  &quot;can claim to be peacful with it only if you dont see it then how tolerant are you?&quot;  I AM INTOLERANT TO PEOPLE PUMMELING OTHERS TO DEATH!  So why do you bring it up fkin?  Whats the point?  I AM INTOLERANT TO PEOPLE YELLING FIRE IN A CROWDED THEATER.  Why did you bring it up fkin?  Whats the point?   Are you going to dismiss my intolerance to these things as lowbrow.<br>
<br>
Is your point that we already muzzle those that offend us?  Or is it that we muzzle those that endanger us.  This case cited that the child was being injured.  Im taking a stand. thats not injury.  Im sure others have said their child was injured by viewing prayer.  Im taking a stand.  Thats not injury.<br>
<br>
How am i to take you when your comparing &quot;pummeling to death&quot; to &quot;bowing head in prayer&quot;  and &quot;uttering under god&quot;  What should i think of your sense of right and wrong?  Support it?  Nay.  That cannot be supported.  That intellectual ingnorance for the sake of entanglement.  Surely all sensible people see a difference between &quot;pummeling to death&quot; and &quot;bowing head in prayer&quot;.  No complicated ethic systems are required.  A natural civil sense of right and wrong will suffice.<br>
<br>
As someone pointed out this case was not filed with reference to unconstutional law.  This case was filed with a notion of injury.  That seeing &quot;under god&quot; spoken injured their child.<br>
<br>
As i was saying this has sooo little to do with religion in the government.  This has everything to do with the majorities right to dictate what constitutes injury via instilling morality and ethics into the law.  The majorities right to dictate society in its government.  It has to be fair but it is fair in this case.   THATS NOT INJURY.  But law suits are being filed with injury as the key term.  Simple execution of a religious belief does not injure those that see it unless it involves obscenity, damage to property, potential for loss of life.   <br>
<br>
If our notion of injury is relaxed so far as to include this then whats next?  Pick anything silly if you like.  I mean isnt it silly that someone is injured by hearing the uttering of two words neither of which constitute an obscenity onto themselves?<br>

<br>
I appreciate the sentiment here that &quot;hey i dont like under god being mandated by law&quot;  FINE.  There is a political process to change it.  Letting congress know by making it an issue is fine.  Rolling over conservatives that support it in congress. Fine.  Theres no harm there.  That would be a healthy sign for our government.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, letting courts strike down law on the basis of injury in the form of the claimant's daughter witnessing the uttering of two words neither of which are obscene in themselves should not occur without sqawking by the people.  injury caused by witnessing the uttering of two words with religious tones should NOT be a basis for courts to overturn laws made by your elected officials.  <br>
<br>
Its an attack on the checks in balances in place in our government.  Its an inflation of court authority.  Abstract injury should not be a basis to strike down laws made by your elected congress.  Such &quot;feelings&quot; should be directed at the election process.  Thats the way to change such laws.  The healthy way.<br>

<br>
It's important to remember that no actual law has been struck down or changed. The court has simply stated that it is unconstitutional for children to say the Pledge in school, because it makes reference to monotheism. And don't argue that point. It does. Also don't argue the logic of the decision. Once you accept that 'under God' does, in fact, endorse a monotheistic religion with Yahweh or Jehovah or whoever as its center, than they had to make it unconstitutional, as it would technically favor a monotheistic religion over all others, which is against the first amendment.<br>
<br>
This decision wasn't brought about by some &quot;abstract notion of injury&quot;, it was brought about by judges who saw that, by the very words of the oath they took, they had to find for the plaintiff. The plaintiff in this case is a zealous git who makes the rest of us atheists look bad, but thems' the ropes. <p>Lauriston Pianoforte<br>That Guy<br>Bard of Quellious</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufkin6666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fkin6666</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/2/02 8:22:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Pledge of Allegiance</span><hr size=1>  Actually no Bulvai I went right to the dictionary for all those quotes as I said.

Clearly constitutional matters are never black and white.  Right and wrong.  Just because a decision was rendered by institutions of the judicial branch doesnt mean the decision had total  agreement inside that institution.<br>
<br>
My point is that i gave my reasons why the law adding the phrase &quot;under god&quot; wasnt unconstitutional (first post).  The only counter argument provided was the courts didnt see it that way.  A decision by courts hardly prohibits a minority viewpoint internal to that institution.  clearly i support that minority viewpoint.<br>

the law in question is 50 years old.  During that time the related ammendments in the constitution have not changed.  It seems we were all living unconstitutionally for 50 years and nobody noticed.  Or atleast thats how it seems when its portrayed as &quot;clearly&quot; unconstitutional.  Or is it that the culture of america is changing? <br>
<br>
Now bout the 9th circuit.  Do you know that in recent history the 9th circuit court has MORE overturned rulings as all the ALL the other circuit courts COMBINED.  Their majority judgement can hardly be construed as perfect.  <br>
<br>
The senate supported 99-0 a resolution disagreeing with the 9th circuit.  Further there is a dissenting opinion. And the court under 9th circuit had the view:<br>
&quot;the lower court's decision to throw out the case found that &quot;the ceremonial reference to God in the pledge does not convey endorsement of particular religious beliefs&quot; <br>
All found here:<br>

<br>
AND YET.  when i gave the board reasons why the pledge of allegiance was constitutional it was dismissed as the court didnt see it that way with no real contention of the point.  I do expect the supreme court to see it the way i posted.  that the law supported no establishment therefor its not unconstitutional.  it gives face to an abstract moral authority titled &quot;god&quot;  with no more religion then your insurance clause that says &quot;act of god&quot;.  monotheist perhaps in cultural history but generic in use.   The senator that sponsored the change said on meet the press in 1954 the key reason was to highlight what is different about the US as compared to the soviet union.  Under god.  under a moral authority.  generic.  no reference to a &quot;respecting an establishment of religion&quot;<br>
<br>
As for the overall thrust of my intial post i borrowed much of it from a speech by a republican senator from georgia to be honest.  A speech he gave in the senate presented on CSPAN. i watch CSPAN while i play if something interesting is going on.  I except his points as my own after i thought bout them.  They are valid.  This ruling will be struck down by the supreme court.  Though the law one day maybe changed in congress.<br>

Here's a label for this reply: exaggeration.<br>
<br>
I try to avoid taking sides of a grudge between two people on the boards. No matter how good the reply it tends to discredit the person I am vouching for and inadvertently make them look like they couldn't stand up for themselves. That said, I don't want shield anyone but point out that Bulvai has replied to you without trolling. Also, I won't go back and read everything but I remember you were the first to claim Bulvai had personal attacks in his post. If don't like blunt replies fine, but don't fuel the &quot;troller&quot; who can match your stubbornness and think I'll lap it up. You had a choice to point out this perceived injury and leave it at that instead of going tit for tat. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ubulvaihammersson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BulvaiHammersson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/2/02 9:58:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Pledge of Allegiance</span><hr size=1> /nods thanks to Esmalyn<br>

To Fkin, this started out as a semi-serious discussion. As it started to get too serious, I backed off the rhetoric a bit and attempted to introduce some levity. If this is criminal, so be it.<br>
<br>
As to your comments on European Integration, it takes, generally, about 3 generations for any sort of real cultural integration to take place when nations are artificially joined. Forgive me for being non-plussed considering the EU was ratified within this not even two-year-old-century<br>
<br>
I will decline from commenting either on your inane labelling accussation or your &quot;ignorant troll&quot; name-calling.<br>
<br>
Suffice to say that I am unsurprised with how this discussion turned out, as it has ended as I'd originally expected. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>
