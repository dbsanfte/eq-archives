hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> Today, Severilous popped in EJ.  A druid camping the zone sees it pop and summons his guild to the zone to kill it for a warrior in the guild.  MB wizards zone in as the guild zones in.  I believe the guild started coming in before the wizards landed in the zone.  As we were gathering the last few stragglers, a necro aggros Sev and pulls it towards where the wizards where.  The wizards MB and killed Sev.<br>
<br>
So was this a KS?  In my book it was.  Maybe the wizards all got into EJ before all the guild did but it's a lot easier for 6 wizards to get into EJ than it is to gather 20+ warriors, clerics, chanters into EJ.  Did we have the man power to do it?  We thought we did.  Was the man power all in EJ before the necro aggro'd?  No, but again easier to get 6 people than it is to get 20 people.<br>
<br>
So who was there first?  the druid.  In fact the druid sow'd the necro that gained the aggro.  That sorta adds insult to injury.  Will we as a guild keep trying to get Sev?  yup, we'll continue but in a way I find it almost futile b/c MB wizards will continue to come in and get the kills before we can get everyone into the zone.<br>
<br>
I don't want to mention names so I guess this isn't a true flame post but I know it'll turn out that way so posted it here.  This really does discourage me in playing the game.<br>

But when it doesn't suit their needs, adhere to it to a T.  I'm guessing that some of the same wizards on this board who bragged about how they would never run over a raid to MB something or would wait until the raid failed to MB it probably were involved in this.  I don't know all the MB's on the server, but in a case like this, PNP sucks bad, but not as bad as those MB's that did what they did today.  Not a KS on technicality, but it's BS none the less. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>

<br>
How many members of your guild were in the zone at the time the wizards arrived?  If it was only like 2 or 3 then the MB wizzies had every right to be there and probably didn't even know your guild was preparing to do Sev.  If on the other hand there were 10 or so guildies there before the first wizard even arrived then that presents a problem that needs to be addressed.  If thats the case then give us names please because those wizards deserve to be flamed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I for one will not participate in an MB kill when a non MB raid has clearly already started forming and has several members of the raid there.<br>
<br>
Did your guild announce to the zone your intention to take Severilous or let the wizards know?<br>
<br>
Had anyone in your guild agro'd Severilous and started to kite him around?  Thats how Lodizal usually ends up being handled and it is also fairly common for Severilous.<br>
<br>
Were the wizards from a single guild/alliance?<br>
<br>
Anyway, Severilous has always been the most contested of the Kunark dragons, mainly because of the green scale.  Many players have alts camped in EJ for the sole purpose of tracking Severilous.  Your best bet to get Severilous would be to do it like ragefire and just have the warrior that is trying to get the scale wait there during Sev's spawn window.  He always spawns within 24 hours of a patch so thats your best bet if you want to minimize the amount of time you have to sit around.  A level 4 mage with sense summon can easily be used to track Severilous (he summons a pet when he spawns and the pet is the only summoned mob that will ever appear in the zone).  That way you'll know immediately when Sev spawns and will be able to get your guild there before any wizards (or another guild for that matter) get word that he's up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontaguethesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montague the Sorcerer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Social Butterfly </span><br>  Posts: 348<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/25/02 12:53:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> Just so you know Tiqua:<br>
<br>
1. Ferdian and Cukak had been in EJ ever since the servers came up yesterday.  Not that it matters.<br>
<br>
2. The necro died while pulling sev, I pulled him the rest of the way.  Not that it matters.<br>
<br>
3. When sev dropped, there werw 23 people in zone.  5 of those were MB wizards, 1 was Cukak (the necro), and another was Desaren (another wizard who had nothing to do with it).  This leaves only 16 other people, I'm not sure where 20 came from.<br>
<br>
4. With this new chat interface, I keep my oocs, shouts, and auctions in a seperate window - and never heard you say he was camped, from the time i got there until the time he died.  I did see you guys start /ooc'ing all sorts of profanity AFTER he died however.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly, I'd just like to ask you:  Did you try sending one of us a /tell?  Or were the /oocs cursing at us all you did?  Personally, If I had recieved a tell that you were &quot;camping&quot; him, even though I agree with Ishan, I wouldn't have manaburn'ed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utalasarfearghus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talasar Fearghus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/25/02 1:02:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> /laugh<br>

<br>
I don't know Cukak very well, only met him a couple times but I do know that he was in EJ since the servers came up because I periodically popped in to check.<br>
<br>
I further know Ferdian was there waiting for him as well every time I checked.<br>
<br>
I didn't know they were together, and had no communication with them about Sev, but I know they were both there for a LOOONG time, at no time did I check EJ and they were not there.<br>
<br>
I was in SF when I got asked if I wanted to burn Sev, and I said yes. I know from the time I zoned in there was not a single /ooc /shout or /auc on this or any other subject.<br>
<br>
The necro (Cukak) died pulling (as I thought he would but god damn he's brave) and then Mont pulled. At this point there was what appeared to be a 'fib' in /ooc saying leave Sev alone and they had been claiming Sev. Sev was pulled at this point so it was moot anyway, but I asked the others who had been there before and they said there had been no /ooc on the subject. These are people I know and don't think they would lie. And I know Ferd and Cukak had been there for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> many</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> hours.<br>
<br>
I can assure you if I zoned in and saw that in /ooc I would have memmed a gate and left.<br>
<br>
It's an unfortunate situation, and I am sympathetic but I do not think there is anything nefarious about it. All I can say is camp the mob, do like you said and announce the fact periodically and the problem should not recur.<br>
<br>
If in the furture you need fast help to kill something I will be happy to assist. Sev will pop again in a few days and I'll be glad to help your Warrior get his scale.<br>
<br>
And in general if you want something like a green scale another thing to do is send burners tells asking for help if you think you may need it. This clearly establishes that you got to the mob first. MOST burners will treat this as priveleged information, and will not spread it around if they can't go. I won't name names but you probably have a good idea who to trust and who not to.<br>

Even before that.  And as soon as Sev pops the druid did say in ooc several times that we were going to try and kill Sev.  The druid logged off to his warrior after several VoR people arrived in the zone.  I can't tell you exactly how many people were in the zone when you killed Sev b/c I was on my wizard porting a few more in.  I do know that I zoned in after Sev dropped and before Montague zoned back into EJ that there were at least 14 VoR (15 if you count the LD) and 4 nonVoR there.  Also if you add my shaman that was camped out so I could port stragglers that'll give you the 20.<br>
<br>
It's not really the people that did it (why I didn't mention names).  It's not even the fact that it happened to a friend of mine.  It's that it did happen.  I really didn't think that MB wizards on Quellious would do something like this, esp after all the argument saying this wouldn't happen.  Well it has happened.<br>
<br>
Yeah I know PNP says it was the wizards kill.  I know the GMs won't do anything if they were petitioned.  I also know this post will most likely be pointless and only end up getting me flamed and vilified.  However it doesn't change the fact that I felt it was wrong.<br>

I quoted your entire post because i want to address all of it.  He acknowledegd that we were in the zone.  By doing that he also acknowledged that he knew we were planning on manaburning sev.  Why would a buncha 60 wizarsd be there other than to MB sev?  No, he didnt need to send a tell to EVERYBODY, but i seriously doubt he even tried /tell'ing just one wizard.<br>
<br>
And also, as I stated in my first post, Cukak and Ferdian were in the zone long before their raid (ever since the servers popped for that matter).  If anybody needed to do a camp check it was them - not that Verant even recognized &quot;camps&quot;.<br>

<br>
no offense to you or the other wizards.  but from my viewpoint would you trust any of the MB'ers out there now?  I see your viewpoint.  You honestly believed that no one else was there to kill Sev.  I don't even hate/dislike the people that killed Sev today.  I'll continue along with my guild to try and kill Sev for our warriors what happened today won't change that.  I'm not asking for support/sympathy.  I was just posting that something happened that I felt was wrong.  But I know the druid did do at least one ooc about taking Sev.  I saw it when my shaman zoned in and before I switched to my wizard to do more porting.<br>
<br>
When did I zone into EJ?  The druid sees sev pop.  Tells my exp group in AR.  Wizard in AR loads EJ evac.  We all evac'd into EJ.  That puts the druid and 3 people immediately into the zone (only 3 b/c I switched to wizard soon after to port and another switched to a chanter).<br>
<br>
I apologize to all that were cussed at.  It shouldn't have been done.  I did ooc stuff but didn't ever cuss or threathen just my disgust over the situation.  No one should have been cussed at.<br>

PS - to address something mont posted.  the druid was there when Sev popped.  Cukak said in ooc that he wasn't on at the time Sev popped but logged on shortly after.  Oh I would also estimate that between Sev popping and him dying about 10min.  And that's being generous. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utiqua.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tiqua</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/25/02 2:00:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utalasarfearghus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talasar Fearghus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/25/02 1:54:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> Wow, hold on a sec, did I just read Tiqua's post above yours saying that the druid had been in zone since server pop as well?

<br>
Had there been I would have turned around and left. Simple as that.<br>
<br>
Mont was there before I was and he didn't see anything either. I know both Ferd and Cukak had been there forever and they said they didn't. If your druid and Ferdian were BOTH camping Sev then the thing to do when he popped (and there was no raid force for either side there yet) would have been to settle it with a lotto or some other way. If there was an /ooc then why wouldn't Cukak/Ferd have spoken up at that point contesting the issue?<br>
<br>
Really both sides <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have called intent as soon as Sev popped. All I know there was nothing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> at all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> said in /ooc /auc or /shout by anyone, about Sev or even a port request the entire time I was there.<br>
<br>
There are conventions to be followed. It has nothing to do with PnP. In situations like this you claim your mob noisily, and if there's a contention you work it out before hand, hopefully in a civilized manner.<br>
<br>
If there had been communication, and polite communication at that, none of this would have happenned. I do know both Cukak/Ferd had been there forever and if your Druid was as well, they should have worked it out as soon as Sev popped. It may be that you guys didn't think you had to because they didn't know what Cukak had in mind, and thought you didn't need to negotiate. Or it just may be that it was off hours and both sides didn't think there would be any competition.<br>

<br>
If you noted there were that many people when Sev <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   dropped</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Not when we zoned in. We zoned in almost immediately after Sev popped I will assume because both Cukak and Ferd were waiting for him.<br>
<br>
Certainly Wizards can get there fast. Had the first pull not failed I doubt there would have been more than a couple VoR in zone when Sev dropped. As happenned we had to pull twice allowing the stated number of VoR to arrive by the time Sev dropped finally.<br>
<br>
We hit the ground running. There was no VoR presence when we zoned in. Nevertheless had someone from VoR been claiming Sev in /ooc we would STILL have backed down. Or I am pretty sure we would. I know I would have not participated anyway.<br>
<br>
Five burners+puller in a zone IS a raid. The spotters had equal precedence and our raid force was assembled MUCH faster.<br>
<br>
EVEN SO had you bothered to claim it we would have backed down. There was no need for the party that had camped Sev for hours and had the raid ready to go before there was any even budding raid group of anyone else to camp check.<br>
<br>
This should have been resolved by the spotters. If there was disagreement among the spotters noisy /oocs would have shied away any burners called in. Or at least forced some negotiation.<br>
<br>
It wasn't even a question of there being another raid force when we zoned in. Once we started prepping and pulling we weren't doint continual /who's, sorry, we were busy.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Believe it or not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> all you had to do was say 'look we've been here a long time and we know you assembled first but [x] has been waiting since server up and [y] really needs a scale, can you let us try it?' and you'd have been suprised at the results.<br>

Yep 3 sounds right. I don't have my log handy at work but 3 sounds right. We had 4 burners in zone when I looked and another porting right there. If I was in the first 3 of a raid forming and I saw 4 non anon sorcerers with recognizeable names I would have started talking fast.<br>
<br>
As for who you can trust I think you know more than a handful you can.<br>
<br>
No one was wrong according to what I see. Neither party communicated. VoR didn't apparently see a handful of sorcerers as a raid forming and we didn't see 3 VoR as a raid forming. We pulled first.<br>
<br>
But honestly, like Mont said, had you asked.. we would have backed down.<br>

<br>
How long does it take your MB team to gather for a kill of Sev?  2 minutes?  Less?  How often must I spam OOC so you will know that a raid is gathering?  Why is it my responsibility to protect my kills from you when you KNOW that you are going to MB, where I might just see a wizard on his way to Sebilis.  What is to stop you from doing this on Ragefire - which is just as easy for you to get to and even more hotly contested.  The &quot;it wasnt engaged yet&quot; BS is all VI is willing to do because they don't want to ban players (and limit profits) for what they consider to be more of a social issue - cant get rid of all the asses, so dont get rid of any.<br>
<br>
Make what excuses you want Mont and FK, you are by your own admission pissing on the rest of Quellious.  Personally, I don't care - I expect wizards to KS at 60 the same way they KSed at 30.  Some wizards are asses, some are not.  I will say that I only know 2 mana burn wizards on the server well, and both have enough class to avoid this type of garbage.  By the Pnp, you can do what you did and nothing can be done in game about it, but dont try and sell &quot;It wasnt our fault&quot; crap here - I for one am not listening.<br>

I don't really know anything about you other then what I've seen posted in the past couple weeks since I started visiting the board.  You say you would have backed down, I have to believe you would have had you known.  Montague on the other hand hasn't done anything on the board, which is my extent of knowledge on him, to show that he would have done anything other than what he did do.  I don't hold it against wizzies for getting MB, it's another fug up without thinking on Verant's part.  <br>
<br>
Because it's getting to the point that anyone that wants a kill that MB's might want, they are either going to have to, <br>
<br>
A) camp the entire force needed for the kill in the zone until it pops <br>
<br>
B) get the ok from the MB crew to kill the mob.  <br>
<br>
Everyone knows the 6 wizzies is gonna get to the kill site before a raid party so it's always going to come down to, &quot;We were here first so STFU.&quot;  I would like to think that wizzies with MB would understand this and give people some time to move into place, but this is just another example of it not happening.  I admit that from my experiences, MB wizzies do not generally care as long as they were there first.  I hope that the ones on here posting they would help a raid or wait some time before moving in are correct, but today seems to show that isn't going to happen unless you consider 6 to 10 minutes enough time for a raid force to show up. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>

There is a great possibility you guys knew they were forming (some of you) but because they didnt claim it you used that as a your way out. Its right, but its not polite.<br>

Or it could be completely opposite and you truly had NO CLUE another guild would even attempt sv after the server came back up. Instead of avoiding possible(more then likely) conflict by making your intentions known before engaging you stayed silent and moved quickly. <br>
