You can agree with Gaelron as much as you want because thats the easiest way for you to blow off the topic. I know why I left the Guild, most of Rel In Por knows why I left the Guild, you are the reason I left the Guild. In fact right before I left Sephrok told me to rethink what I was doing and my exact words were, if she ever leaves the Guild I would be more than happy to come back. And don't even bring up the loot thing (especially not you) cause I don't wanna hear it I rolled on one item while I was in Rel In Por a Trak Tooth. I don't just leave a Guild cause I don't get what I want Hypnotic is a good example of that.<br>
<br>
If you wanna get technical you didn't outright do anything to anyone in the Guild, indirectly you did. Your last post cracks me up for the simple fact that your so damn quick to try to push the issue off on someone else or something. For instance, no names mentioned someone got pissed the night you pulled your @#%$ in Thurg and posted on our board your reply was flaming him for @#%$ that had nothing to do with the topic. <br>
<br>
Flame RiP? Show me where I flamed them. I don't get pissed if others don't like me for who I am, however I don't appreciate being looked at with disrespect for something someone else did. There is nothing you can say or do to justify your actions. Hell if it wasn't for you being yourself and not caring what others think we wouldn't be having this discussion, now would we? Be considerate of those around you, thats good advice. Try thinking before your actions, thats more good advice. Quit now and save RiP future embarrassment, thats the best advice i've heard in a long time.<br>
<br>
One more thing, you say I found a open door to get out of RiP and I used it. Talk to Valid and ask him exactly what I said the night before when I had heard about the sh!t you pulled. And also ask him how many people shared my feelings. Then come back and tell us all about it, i'm sure there is plenty who would like to hear the results. <p><br><center><img src="http://nitchjuggallo420.homestead.com/files/nitchusa2.jpg"><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=675" target=_blank>Nitch's Inventory</a>

I never said you left because of loot, I said you *probably* left over something as childish AS loot, in fact my specific words were: <br>
&quot;I have done nothing to you and you prolly got pissed cus you werent gettin loot or some stupid childish crap like that&quot;<br>

I'd like to know how I am, in any way, trying to push what I have done off on other people.  I will tell you right now, I do not deny anything I have done.  Because frankly I have done nothing worth bitching over unless you have the mentality of a 10 year old.  Which you have displayed is *about* what you have.<br>

I dont need to talk to anyone to form my own hypothesis as to why you left.  If you think im a bitch thats your perogative.  I think you are a few choice words myself, but calling names will get people nowhere, if you want to act like a child, go to the daycare.  Until then keep your &quot;flames&quot; comin and i'll keep the water sprinkler on.<br>

I don't think there was anything to do with this that I could fail at. Pretty much everything that was said about you is common knowledge. I don't think there is anyone except Gaelron that would argue the point that you do anything good for the Rel In Por name.<br>

-Its funny how you (Gaelron) cant even realize that you are one of the two people defending her on this entire board!  You keep asking for more evidence that Sirinab does evil things, and is bad as Moho., but wernt you the one not too long ago who flamed NP guild for training, being rude, etc.. and didnt offer any proof yourself because you &quot;formated your hard drive&quot;? Also, dont you think that as one of two Sirinab supporters on this board, where everyone else constantly tells you she trains, kses, etc.. that you are missing something?  It should have hit you like a brick wall by now, but you just cant see it.<br>
<br>

<br>
Why are any of you in guilds?<br>
<br>
Seriously.  Think about it for a minute.  Why are you all in the guilds that you are in?  Are you in them as a means to an end (getting that phat lewt)?  Are you there to be with friends and/or family?  Are you there because it just seems like the right thing to do?  Seriously... think about it.<br>
<br>
That being said... let me tell you my answer.  I'm in it for family.  Montyy, Syllie, Humix, and Nehi are all RL family to me.  Montyy got invited into Lor Mani a few months back.  He brought me along with him.  We then brought along Nehi, Syllie and Uggmugg.  We all joined the Lor Mani family.  We play to have fun together in a fantasy world.  During my time with Lor Mani, I have met people that I have come to love as much as my own family.  I have spent time with people like Brice (a man with unmatched skill and kindness), Adus, Brekthar, Tienlung, Darkwoods, Dak, Keif, Autumnwyld, Kimja, Kalani, and so many others... ending in Shagbert (who has easily gotta be the single greatest embodiment of all that is good in EQ... even if he IS a druid).  Every night, I log on and spend time with family... getting xp, raiding the planes, helping on epics, etc.<br>
<br>
I am a member of Lor Mani, and they are my family.  Everything I do, I do knowing that I reflect on my family... and that I'd never willingly dishonor my family.  That being said, I (as an officer) will also be the first to confront members of my family who (through their actions) disrespect our family.  <br>
<br>
That all being said, I'd have made Sirinab apologize publicly, or just sniped her outright.  I have no respect or patience for those who dont respect their guilds.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day.<br>

&quot;I don't think there is anyone except Gaelron that would argue the point that you do anything good for the Rel In Por name.&quot;<br>
<br>
Considering the fact that only 5 or so people have even responded to this thread, that quote means nothing.<br>
<br>
Quote from Nitrouz:<br>
&quot;LMFAO!!!!!! Moho 2.0!!! that's gotta be the funniest thing i seen in ages. 10x funnier cuz it's almost true....&quot;<br>
<br>
Nitrouz, your typical starting of every post you make of &quot;lol&quot; or &quot;lmfao&quot; or &quot;rofl&quot; gets a little played out after a thousand posts like that.  One other thing, If anyone is reminisent(sp? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) of mohogany its you.  You are the one that sits in Seb non stop, you have pretty much taken the roll of Moho after he got banned.. noone is as bad as moho.. but other than his extreme's, you are an exact replica of him, so you have no room to talk.<br>
<br>
Quote from Stehe:<br>
&quot;-Its funny how you (Gaelron) cant even realize that you are one of the two people defending her on this entire board!&quot;<br>
<br>
You're also missing the fact that I have known Gael alot longer than any of you people who seem to know ALL there is about me after one week of flame posts on a freaking message board and rumors your friends told you.  So yes, he is defending me because he has reason to. I am not a bad person as you think I am, but I am not going to waste my breath trying to convince people like you who automatically believe every word you hear about people.<br>
<br>
To answer your question Quas:<br>
I am in a guild to have fun most of all, this is a game and that is what is ment to be had.<br>
Second of all I am in a guild to do the things guilds do, go to new and undiscovered places like when SoL comes out.  Do guild raids such as tov etc.  No, its not all about loot, but weather you like it or not, loot brings us together and pretty much is the main goal of EQ, would you not agree? Sure there are other great aspects but loot plays a major role in the game, you just need to know where to draw the line when it comes to loot and friends.<br>

 saying that Sirinab is like Mohogany is insulting.. Everything bad about EQ Mohogany did and he wonders why people flame him all the time.. <br>

<br>
I couldn't have said it better myself to be honest. &quot;Everything bad about EQ Mohogany did and he wonders why people flame him all the time.. &quot; Replace Mohogany with Sirinab in that sentence and you have a one sentence summary of this whole thread.<br>
