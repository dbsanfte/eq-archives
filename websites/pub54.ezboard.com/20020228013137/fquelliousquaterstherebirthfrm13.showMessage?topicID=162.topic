I have RL responsibilities and I just cannot tie myself down to 8-hour raids, 4-hour exp group, etc at this point.<br><br>Stylee was wearing full cobalt (minus bracer) when I retired him.  The legs were on loan, and I gave those back to Harkel.  I gave away most of my other gear to my best friend irl who has a level 60 warrior.  The things he did not need, I gave to various other good friends of mine in game as departing presents.  I gave away EVERYTHING I had except for my rbg which I sold so I could twink out some toons.<br><br>Let it be known that I was offered $200 cash or 70k + mana robe for my cobalt breastplate which I got on a Fifth Eclipse raid long ago.<br><br>Then, 2 nights ago, long after all this happened, I got tells from Holyheal (co leader of 5e) demanding I give the breasplate back to the guild.  Keep in mind they have gotten almost 3 full sets of plate armor in ToV in the past week.<br><br>I told him that it was already given away, sorry.  I felt that I earned that bp, as well as the other pieces, and I did what was right by giving them away and not selling them.  Well, he has turned this into a HUGE ordeal, and consistently deletes my posts on the 5e message board, so I am bringing it here for others to give their opinion.  Here are some quotes from HH.<br><br>Re: about stylee and zomar's incident<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> No matter what if Zomar is in 5E,it's none of ur business!<br><br>Even he left us,he is not a thief like you.We respect what everyone who left us,it's his choice,like we respect ur retirement.However,I can't make myself to respect a guy who stole our properties and claim he is loyal.Stealing is a crime,as a liar and think others r fools is worse!<br><br>Don't post anything on our forum but ur retirement topic!Next time ur post will get nothing answered and deleted directly.<br><br>Holyheal Healuinasec<br>Lv 10 High Priest<br>Co-leader of Fifth Eclipse <br>_______________________END QUOTE__________________<br><br>I am now a thief because I gave away MY bp?  Does 5e think their warriors rent themselves out to the guild, and expect no reward in return?<br><br><br>Another quote from Holyheal:  &quot;I didn't only ask the BP,but also the other loots u got from guild.Like I said,NO ONE will get reward,even ur name is Thelon or Ghenghis,&quot;<br><br>So what he is saying is, nobody gets reward for anything they do for the guild?  Wow, great way to treat one of your founding and most active members (me).<br><br>Another quote from Holyheal:  &quot;Well,personally I don't care the BP,if he returns it to us,it means he is still a friend of us,if no,it's ok.We just treat him as a THIEF ! Like Gladorr did to us.&quot;<br><br>So he doesn't care about the bp, but if I don't return it I'm a thief?  And if I do return it I'm a friend still?  Double entendra anyone?<br><br><br>Anyway, sorry to make you all suffer through this, but he keeps deleting my posts on the guild message board.  As I posted there (before he deleted it)  Fifth Eclipse guild rules say nothing anywhere at all about members owing gear back to the guild if they leave or retire.<br><br>Also, a cobalt bp is trash.  They are now farming ToV regularly, and soon all their warriors will be in full Kael armor.  Cobalt bp is nothing compared to Warlord, why make such a stink about it?<br><br>Is Fifth Eclipse a greedy guild?  Please, comments, anyone.<br><br>Combac.  Stylee. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/unilerek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nilerek</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/23/02 6:54:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Holyheal ~ co-leader of Fifth Eclipse</span><hr size=1> holyheal is a moron, its your bp, not the guilds.

Stylee I consider you a friend and if this is the real you still I still do. The return policy was designed for upgrades for other members. Seeing how Stylee was already in Cobalt he was seriously in line for the next ToV BP that dropped. We ALL do turn ins of droppable stuff to pass down. That has been known since day one of the guild creation and NO ONE ever has an issue with it until they think they can do better. Stylee was a great warrior and he will be missed but this act of childish malice is just rediculous. He has been given all the time he wanted to post his case on our internal boards then decided to move it to the public instead of working out a personal conflict with HH. And for you slamming her /rude. You don't know the first thing about her or how she plays. I have been in AE groups, raids and just about every other situation and she keeps a damn wizard alive of all people. <br><br>I hope you can work out your issues with her Stylee, but if not oh well. Don't go slamming an organization that went to bat for you when you pissed off over 2/3 of the people you talk to with your big mouth (yes you know you spout off a lot so don't even try to defend that one, was one of the reasons I like you). It is not so much that the guild demands things that are given out on raids, it is the fact we are an up and coming guild that wants EVERYONE to be equipped as well as we can get them. So it is a big deal when a 60war quits and the 58s could really use that Cobby BP until we get more Kael ones. Oh well, to each their own but have respect for the rest of us man. <p><b>  <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18567>Zupe Blastemded</a></b><br>60 Sorcerer of Quellious<br><a href="http://fiftheclipse.wwm.net">Member of The Fifth Eclipse</a><br>Follower or Mithaniel Marr</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/23/02 11:06:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Holyheal ~ co-leader of Fifth Eclipse</span><hr size=1> &quot;Seeing how Stylee was already in Cobalt he was seriously in line for the next ToV BP that dropped.

I have never seen a more  immature and childish act then this one by Styee. Grow up. Why do you bring internal guilds things into public places? I'm going to go out on a short short limb here and say it was STRICTLY for embarressment sake.  Yes its a KNOWN GUILD RULE that when you leave the guild, you give things that the GUILD earned back to the family. Sorry Stylee but you alone didnt kill Trak. It's not just your BP. But perhaps if you had shown some adherence to the rules, you could have kept it. When i left 5e briefly, i offered all my gear back that i had been awarded during my time there. But Ghenghis  showed their appreiaction..as im sure they would have to you..by letting me keep the gear. But whatever, you kept the BP. I honestly didnt give a rats ass until i read how you aired dirty laundry out on a public server. You dont like Holyheal, she doesnt like you. Grow some balls and stop crying for mama Quellious when you run into a problem. <br><br><br>The situation is over. It was over when the BP was given away.

Now if every warrior in guild has colbalt bp or better, then hell be my guest, but that is not the case, to better the guild this rule was invented. If you have a problem with this rule dont join the guild. I remember explaining this exact same rule right before loot was given out on that trak raid because that was one of the first trak kills we had as a guild, obviously stylee did not have a problem then. Now I have never harrassed Stylee, nor will i ever do so, its his own choice to leave honorably or not. Now with holyheal harrassing stylee? All she did was ask for the bp bak, which is her job as guild leader to do so, she used a very direct approach. It really disturbs me that you guys can judge and flame someone just like that.  <br>.........................................................<br>salta dont be talking about stuff that u dont know about, cuss u werent even in solb. Holyheal camps ragefire, my guild cleared fgs twice for her, 20hrs later, lc monk openhand (thats right a monk camping ragefire)  shows up saying he was camping it but went ld for 24 hrs. So we try to talk to him reasonably, but no he says lc will get more people here faster then 5e, and its his camp, so gm was called and we were foced to roll and the monk won the roll and we left. Now next week hh camps it again, we clear fgs again, 2 lc clerics came up with us when we were the ones clearing fg, and claims camp and refuse to roll for camp. Then they made an agreement that all three would all stay at the camp the whole time and camp ragefire till it pops, and then help the others with their ragefire, thats honorable and fine, but 2 hrs later, both lc clerics camp, they came bak in 13 hrs, one of them agrees that camp belongs to us, and left, the other lc cleric didnt not leave and still claims camp, so after 2 hrs, lc cleric camps again, comes bak in 12hrs, claims camp still, died 3 times, all three times asking me to drag his corpse, this time lc and 5e cleared fgs together then u have lc cleric garrick running his mouth off being his normal charming self, but thats another story, after fgs claered sure enough he camps again, after another 10 hrs or so, the ragefire npc spawns around 8 am in the morning same time when the lc cleric poped after his sleep, well my guild got there, got some friends from other guilds, while lc got one war there, so we killed ragefire fair and square, now u calling us stealing ur ragefire camp? give me a break, through out this whole incident hh has been in solb, only when she is killed by fg she was away from the camp, can u say the same for ur clerics? And how do I know this? because I was there for 20+ hrs during those days, and was there for all those fg clearings. Now i'm not flaming Lc, i respect alot of the guys that i've grouped with and known, otherwise i'd have posted this a long time ago.<br>....................................................<br>and nilek or watever your name is, dont go around calling people morons when u dont know much at all, it kind of goes bak to you.<br>Driftin <br>Officer of Fifth Eclipse <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=162.topic&start=21&stop=28>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=162.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=162.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=162.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=162.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=162.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=162.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm6">Fear<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm7">Hate<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm8">Sky<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm11">Private Discussion <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm12">Posts Moved</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.coolsavings.com/index.asp?Ref=ezboard&BN=link-freecouons&BL=print>PRINT FREE COUPONS AT CoolSavings.
