But I left it in the flame board section, since most of the &quot;good drama&quot; people would remember from back in the day, is old flames, etc. <br>
<br>
Disclaimer 2: Sorry that I dont possess the ability to keep my posts from being long winded. I swear, everything I learned about typing long posts, I learned from Havusin in his younger days. :P<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I've always been one who enjoyed hearing others stories of Quellious history. Since I didnt start until January 2k, I always enjoy the 1999 stories. <br>
<br>
Since I didnt start playing like a fiend until later in 2k, I like to hear the &quot;early uber&quot; stories as well. The Wraith and Vis together stories. The Slayers of Slaw, Legendary Defenders etc etc stories. Of course nobody will ever forget the calendar system of Quellious, that killed the original msg board. <br>
<br>
I thought of this idea for a thread, when someone made the comment in reference to Salta, Ishan, and Ravenark not going away anytime soon. It made me smile at my monitor, realizing just how long I've been reading Ishan's posts, and reading his sigs. The Kleeshay sig is my favorite, although you're old ones are great Ish. <br>
<br>
I dont remember when i started paying attention, but I think i've been reading Ishan's posts, since atleast when he was 52, maybe 51. The only thing I remember about the old quellious msg board, what little bit I read of it, was the Infamous, never forgotten, LC thread started by Gnix. Or I'm not sure if it was exactly started by him, but I do remember reading all of those posts. <br>
<br>
Anybody have some good stories from their times on quell back in the 1999 days? Or good &quot;remember when?&quot;'s from the old msg board? <br>
<br>
I havent forgotten how much of a sore spot the old msg board is for most. And I havent forgotten the calendar system. I was around for that. But it wasnt all bad. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      Remember the &quot;player of the week&quot; stuff? I remember Runicmyst had a few drawings... not much else :P<br>
<br>
For me.. <br>
<br>
I played a War to 40 (Dook Diggler the Dwarf War) from Jan 2k until right after the first week of Kunark. (it was so neat seeing like a bazillion lvl 51's that day).. and the only people I still keep in touch with from those days would be Ethel Etana, Eris (forget his Rangers name), Magis (forget his pally's name), Amoran (great guy, chanter of Sotu), and Palest and Trinity (great people of SR)...oh and of course. The Nomad Souls.. the greatest people on the server <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     .. Denia, Kron (not Krondath) Lakars, Daranin, Tenon (Akon), Azkirte, Gurunt (was weird how we werent guilded together really, but you will always be a nomad) Tomac (forget his monks name), I didnt talk to him much, i remember Skrabbit being in Nomad.. The original Denia...lots of good people. Later on when the guild Heralds of the Blue Moon combined... Makgog/Contemptous/Crick and others joined over, that was great as well. <br>
<br>
When I played again, and ate, slept, and dreamed about eq from August of 2k, until Sept/Oct of 2001. Where I was playing 15 hours (sometimes more) a day. And did the Descent, and then Vis thing, that was a great time with more memories than imaginable. But that was too recent for it to be considered old history. <br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, enough from me, I was just in a reflective mood, and figured i'd pop up some reading material. <br>

Always thought it was a cool name and I think it was either Lguk or Karnor that we eventually met ... not sure which.  <br>
<br>
Dunno m8, lots of stories to tell - like heading on my first FG raid with 30-40 people there (which was not moderated by QQ) and some dorfie warrior wielding an 'uber' mithril 2h staff (which prompted me to go and get one).  <br>
<br>
First raid was successful !  <br>
<br>
Then there is my first outing to Lguk, where I first met Banelion and I fell off the bridge and was like WTF am I ????? <br>
<br>
Bane rescued my sorry ass then too ! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Then there was meeting Poper (bless his dorfie soul) for the first time - he was level 15 or so and I was around level 26 and he used to want to group with me A LOT!, he caught up with me soon enough tho and was level 30 by the time I was and he got his ex axe UBER ! by then.  <br>
<br>
We hunted outside PAW for ages together and also in lguk.  <br>
<br>
Also meeting the Gomgom twins if anyone knew em ? Mogmog and Garamog ? the gnome mage and cleric .. used to group with em as much as I could in SK at the Aviak house.  <br>
<br>
Then there was CT grouping heavily with a cleric named Pishoque.  To this day, I think he is the oldest person on the server that I still group with.  <br>
<br>
Then meeting all the lguk crew who I used to group with boatloads:  Spellquestor, Easier, Wellington, Banelion, Alyse, Falconus, Goza, Stitt (now Boldair), Treeweaver, Marhiok, Catminx ... sure I have missed a few!. <br>
<br>
Oh! and Kropdog also in Oasis of Marr. When I ditched my cleric and re-started Raluvin (with twink equipment) we kicked some fecking ass there!<br>
<br>
Lemme see, oh all the newbies ! Blal = one of em <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , then there was my ugly twin, Juilin.  <br>
<br>
And of course, PoH during one of the first euro raids I led there - I called on Asky to come help.  Help ? jesus - he practically pulled the Meastro on the first pull to camp and we nailed his sorry ass to the wall.  <br>
<br>
And PoF euro raid also, where Trex was late and I was a lowly 49 level monk and we didnt have enough people (13 in total I believE) to beat up a gnome on drugs.  I was assigned to pull the zone by myself (which was fun) and we had a couple of wipeouts .. but I think we finally got Bumadan his tear! <br>

I'm guessing you are thinking of Legendary Heroes, we always got confused for them. But, the Legendary Defenders are still around, stronger than ever, and kicking butt. Love those guys and gals.<br>
<br>
I remember the old QQ website and boards. Anyone remember Ishan's comic strip? That was great. Radjan had her own column too! Towards the end, I was the &quot;guild coordinator&quot; for the site. My job was to make sure all the guild listings were accurate and to keep tabs on when new guilds were created/disbanded. I was also a member of the much-maligned Reservation Committee (I was the voice of the little guilds). I remember hating when the server went FFA, but now I could never imagine going back to a reservation system. I even still have admin rights at the old QQ board.<br>
<br>
I remember quitting and coming back, and again, and again. I'm done quitting now.<br>
<br>
I remember getting mad when I read the patch message where they removed rubicite from the game. I don't think I even realized what it was at the time.<br>

I remember when I was a n00b wandering in Freeport and watched the Slayers of Slaw take down Sir Lucan for the Soulfire quest, and thinking &quot;My god...they can kill *guards*&quot; Was one of my first brushes with Uberness...<br>
<br>
Ahh, Ishan. I remember the good times guilded with him, I remember running to Oasis to see him get married. And yes, a darn fine humor sig maker.<br>
<br>
As to the old tales on the Quellious Server. I think over the years I've been lucky to have been involved with some of the great roleplayers/storytellers on the server. Tristadorn and the &quot;Errolisi Saga&quot;. Radjan and &quot;La Forza del Destino&quot;. Blitzfeld and the &quot;Call of Thunder&quot;. All the great times spent with the Fallen Eagles during my own attempt at a character story. And of course, the Adventurer's Leage of Norrath. Tyluroth's acid wit. Ryenia's songs. Coryn's &quot;Ooops&quot; pulls. Bombil's Brews. And the most selfless act ever done by Cyrus Stargazer...<br>
<br>
And from the old QQ...The stories by Cantarus and Saroeb and Synjari. What ever happened to old Cantarus and the Naked One? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Things are different now. New characters for me, most of the &quot;uber&quot; folks I knew are off doing &quot;uber&quot; things. Some new friends made, some enemies made.

<br>
Here's one for ya.<br>
<br>
I can't remember his name, some shammy who got banned for using a bug to farm Rubi in CT twinked me out for holding his FBE while his char was reset due to some bug, forget what it was.  Way back, I was like level 22 and he twinked me with almost full crafted minus BP and boots, BP neck and the 5 str/dex rings.  Yeah, I was smoking, not to mention we had just finished the Langseax of the Wolves quest for the uber 2hs.  Back then Sol A was a favorite hang out of ours, NO ONE was ever there and great loot back in the day.<br>
<br>
Well, back then Wraith and Greater Druids were pretty big, Wraith might have been the &quot;uber&quot; guild on the server.  Yeah, I know, like anyone was uber back then.  Anyway, one day in Sol A, the nasty bridge down from LS, everone knows it, death by fire.  I fell in and decided to swim for it, gonna get out of there somehow, ended up zoning into Sol B.  To this day, I'm not even sure where I ended up.  Somewhere down by the bugs/bats/solusek shaman.  Anyway, knowing Droz and the original founders of GD (can't remember their names, couple of druids, Mistsomethingorother and forget her roommates name) both of which were fairly big, neither of which were able to get enough people to get my body, which had everything I owned on it.  I had just decided that I wasn't going to get my body back, when a GM sent me a tell saying a friend had petitioned for me (I hadn't petitioned, figured my stupidity, why would they help) and since she went down there and almost died (Yeah n00b ignorance, didn't know they couldn't be killed) that she would drag my body to the LS zone for me.<br>
<br>
So, to this day, I say thank you Mandybeth for helping me that day and keeping me addicted to this dang game.<br>
<br>
That is one of my many n00b stories from way back. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>

And last but not least...<br>

<br>
Legendary Heroes, along with the Protectorate of Norrath, and I guess a big part of Quell's history will always be the Dragons of Asia, Kings of Chaos, etc etc.<br>
<br>
Ral you remember Dook really? I was so proud of my full suit of bronze. I didnt complete the set until I was low 30's at Cazic Thule. <br>
<br>
Cazic Thule was the best. I remember their being long long lists to get in groups (seemed like it was worse than lguk) ... I always knew to run back then when I saw the gorilla's coming to zone. I was like (wtf? this place is ALL lizards and gators, but they must be REALLY deep to see the gorillias). <br>
<br>
Camp Check! &quot;Silvered Guards&quot; &quot;Tae Room&quot; &quot;Upper Tae&quot; &quot;Archon&quot; &quot;Green Pool&quot; &quot;Blue Pool&quot; &quot;Maze&quot; &quot;AoF&quot;... <br>
<br>
man CT was packed back then. I wasnt there for the Rubicite days, I hear that was even worse, but I do know about a month later when I hit CT, it was still long waiting lists. <br>
<br>
I remember when Dook was lvl 20, and Tenon (Akon) told me I should go camp for the Painbringer. I said &quot;whats that?&quot; he said &quot;This really nice high lvl drop, its a fast sword, has neat looking blade, and even proc's&quot; I said &quot;Wow, who's going to give me that?&quot; he said &quot;You gotta go wait for it, in a line, when it drops, most will already have it, they'll maybe let you have it, if you're patient and polite&quot;<br>
<br>
Well I camped for 6 hours straight before I got my painbringer. I didnt care if others told me it was also called the trainbringer. Hell it wasnt gonna proc for another 15 lvls. And I felt so cool when Tenon &quot;pulled some strings&quot; and got Krondath (dont remember what guild he was in then, maybe Sotu) and Malla (she wasnt in Vis yet) and 4 others who were doing King/Camp/Priest spawn in Solb -- gave me various random items and let me wait for my painbringer. Malla and Krondath and the rest were SO UBER back then. They were almost 50. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I guess another person I remember from my Dook days is Yenalen. Freaked me out when I was playing in Descent one day, when Ninadar logged on as Yenalen, telling me how the original Yen (his rl bud) had quit a while back, although he still logged on occaisionally. <br>
<br>
As for server history, although not entirely old history. I saw that LC got the emp kill. And although I dont pay attention to other server firsts etc etc, it sounded like Quellious was the 5th or 6th to do this? I think the only other things that we had done like in the first 10 or something was... <br>
<br>
Occy had the first wizard epic of any server. <br>
Vis Maior was like the 4th or 5th guild to kill Phara Dar<br>
Now LC like one of the first to do emp. Its neat. <br>
<br>
...here I thought Quell would always fall more behind or something along those lines.<br>
<br>
And I still say that had Wraith, LC, and Vis combined efforts a year ago to kill AoW when it was considered unkillable when I tried so hard to get them to do it. That our server would have been first, a month or so before LoS did it. <br>

<br>
Moonlight Crusaders was/is my home on Q, though. I'll not forget how incredible a guild it was, uber though it wasn't. A great group of incredibly talented and selfless folks, convinced that uber was secondary to having fun. Yeah, we had those who had a deep-seated need to be uber, but most of em were polite enough to keep it level.<br>
<br>
I can remember standing up to some DoA lowbie that was trying to be a thug and having all my friend scream in terror. Too much fun, and the DoA thug in question (Sparq or somesuch) backed down when she realized that DoA really wasn't going to come and destroy my life, threats or no. I'll never forget a friend on that same camp sending me a tell &quot;You are a God&quot; =)<br>
<br>
I remember when Play Nice was instituted and all the stupidity that came about.<br>
<br>
I remember seeing Niira (one of the first, if not the first, shamen to reach 50) soloing guards in WK. She was utterly godlike to me then, and had a pet! <br>
<br>
I remember when Allakhazam's was only one page.<br>
<br>
I remember when smithing was a money maker, when people would get ports to you to pay good money for banded. <br>
<br>
I remember seeing a 40th+ lev half-elf warrior in full steel plate, store bought, and thinking he was the most uber looking thing in the world, especially with his paired Yaks. It boggled me that someone so well outfitted could exist, heck it was only November of 99 at the time =)<br>

<br>
i had joined a guild not long after the server came up. maybe 1-2 months? a guild called black legion. it was a pvp guild. that guild and another, dont remember the name, had the first guild war on the server. it started with both guilds sitting at the platform in north ro waiting essentially for the gm to ring the bell. heh he shouted across the zone, 'get ready to ruuummmmmmble!'. and to think one of my best friends was the one who started the war in the first place. /bonk malefico<br>
<br>
there's a lot more that i remember but just dont have the time to do so.<br>
