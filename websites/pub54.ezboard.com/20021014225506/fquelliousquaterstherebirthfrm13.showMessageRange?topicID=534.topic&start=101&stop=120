By the way, where does one go about getting a shotgun in EQ?  Is that like a uber drop off of mobs in VT or something?<br>

I am glad the enchanters have it worked out.. Amaya is a very sweet person.. and I am sure the radiant enchanter is to...... Cazel can be done by a loan necro FYI, taking over 40plus minutes to kill... and I am willing to help as needed..<br>

Hate - Long time ago... I know we (UP) were up and were clearing to Maestro.. was almost clear to him... and radiant came up and aggro'd the Maestro.. after killing the few of them up it visited our camp.... killing most... after rezzing, clearing the rest the way to Maestro and killing him... Radiant decided to leave the zone... After clearing alot of the first floor we should not have had to race to kill the Maestro... <br>
<br>
Hate recent - have no clue...<br>
<br>
I do not believe that UP would ever intentionally train a guild or anyone for that matter... I have known ulwern for a long time.. that is not his MO, or UP's... ..As a member of UP we have left hate on many occasions just because another guild was there...  My rl brother and friends are all still in UP.. Training folks is not what they are about... <br>
<br>
I have no reason to believe that Radiant would intentionally train either.. always been nice to me...... <br>
<br>
as a fyi, I have /q out of hate logged back in and still had aggro... kept it for 2, /q's finally rebooted my pc and that seemed to have worked...<br>
<br>
Really think all of this is misunderstanding...... In the end it is good to see the Enchanters work this out... and I am always game to fear kite Cazel.... <br>

We were not racing you to Maestro that night.  We were told by your raid leader that you were not interested in first floor mobs and were heading up to the second floor to kill Inny.  Maestro aggro'd when I pulled mobs from the entrance to the throne room and even though I was FD'd in a safe spot, proceeded to wipe out our camp.  I have pulled Maestro many times and he doesn't move unless I want him to move.  Somebody, either you guys or us, had some chain aggro going that time or he would have never made it to the camp.  <br>
<br>
We left hate shortly after that because even though you guys still said that you were heading upstairs, you proceeded to stay in the throne room and intercept every pull I brough by.  We camped out and came back the next morning with Inny still up, knowing full well that we were decived.  <br>
<br>
That is where this began and is why we weren't willing to play nice Friday night.  I do know that we did not bring that train and I also watched you guys all /quit and then come back and ninja-loot our corpses while we continued fighting.  You're saying you didn't bring it, then how come you had some deaths?  Mobs clearly aggro'd some of you guys first.  After this shit was done and we moved down a bit, I brought a pull of about 10 mobs and ran right passed you and not one mob stopped to hit you guys.  They all followed me to our camp.  Had we pulled that first mess, alll of you would have been still standing at the end. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uledronesoultaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ledrone Soultaker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/23/02 12:02:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=534.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good ole Radiant? eh?</span><hr size=1> Vald, you're crowding my dark side again!!<br>

And do call on me anytime. Also Thank's Medicco for getting me on the right mobs during the trainage. I am not sure where they came from. We were there one minute trying to decide where we want to go next and then poof tons of mobs and extra peeps. Either way we all lived and took the mobs down. I think we had our epic cleric camp towards the end just in case we needed rezzes but all in all we had 10 or so of us left standing. Tegdain and myself I know for sure. There is no Q'ing out for us warriors. And yes i was on the wrong mob a few times until we got down to me and Teg in our group. I will take the blame and again thank Medicco for getting me on the right assist....=) There was no ninja looting, that would not be possible without getting the exp, it was more like cleaning up left overs but hmmmmm.....left overs are good, even to us DE's. i will reimburse if you really believe that there was someting that valuable left. Not sure about the next pull coming through us, if they did i missed em and so did the ones getting rezzed. Either way all in all I got a few new friends and maybe a few enemies out of the deal. Also got to work with some old friends to help take out a few. Sorry this happened all and the ones I know and even the ones i do not, call on me anytime....maybe a few exceptions up to the progress from here...hehe<br>
<br>
As for the thought on Ulwern, he has brought me to where I am today and I am very thankful for that. He has helped me work my way up since 35 and I know he is a good guy. Inspect me sometime, I can probably list you 5-10 peices that he has either helped me get or that he has handed to me. As I will for our warriors coming up the ranks...<br>

Raehn call on me anytime again. I have a full well rounded group that will come to assist anytime we're on. Just name it, i owe you one atleast.<br>

<br>
Hear me out before you fire away at me for defaming him, as I am well aware of the deserved esteem in which you hold him.<br>
<br>
I've spent a lot of time in groups with Trist and Maeve, known em for better'n a few years now, and Maeve near as long as I've played EQ (*waves* to Captain Looooove and the Holognome). We grouped quite a bit and Trist was even tossing around the idea of recruiting with a guild that I was an officer in (Moonlight Crusaders, and this might show how old a bit of history this is).<br>
<br>
There's a whole lot of people what say good things about Trist, and a whole lotta people what say bad things. Hard to reconcile the two at face value. The key to the matter is this...<br>
<br>
Tristadorn is very, VERY good at pissing people off.<br>
<br>
Tristadorn is a fiery, passionate fellow, and this is the characteristic that causes so many love/hate reactions. People that are on his good side see his passion as drive, fire, what have you. People on his bad side see him as an inrascible flamethrower with a penchant for nasty insults and pointed invective.<br>
<br>
I have been on both sides of Tristadorn these many years, and can safely make these observations. <br>
<br>
To those of you who think Radiant has a bad rep, I ask that you attempt to look at Radiant's actions outside of Tristadorn's posts. I do not defend them, merely point out that I see them being defamed far less than many.<br>
<br>
To those of you that think that Radiant shines like morning dew and fresh fallen snow, look to unmended fences and the smoldering ruin of bridges left burnt.<br>
<br>
Again, I reiterate the fact that, while our relationship is fairly cool due to some RL stupidity from years ago, I respect a lot of things that make up the man behind Tristadorn, and feel no shame in admitting it. Nothing but love for Maeve, and that helps too =)<br>
<br>
I am more on the side of those who think that Radiant has a rep more good than bad, especially since seeing Reahn's post on her decision. While I've never had the pleasure of grouping with Raehn, I have always been impressed with the tone of good humour I've seen, and am doubly impressed that you would step forward thus and extend the olive branch. Not that I am implying that you intended this effect, but Radiant certainly looks the better for your presence and your actions, Raehn.<br>
<br>
This is not a flame at Trist, more an honest opinion of one of the reasons why Radiant's rep does not always reflect its' actions. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

<br>
You're right. I am good at pissing people off. Over the years playing EQ, I would say I've cooled down ALOT. Anyone remember Trist vs Tamas, the epic flame battle? A couple months ago, we reconciled and he even came on a few raids with us and I found out I really sincerely liked him. Ah well.<br>
<br>
But what really pisses me off and gets me going is when my family or friends are wronged. I don't give a flaming rats SHIT who you are, if you've hurt my family I'm going to revile you. I'm going to piss you off. I'm probably going to piss you off alot. Why? Because it gets your attention on me and not the family. I have a thick skin, and I'll take your beatings all day long. I really don't give a shit.<br>
<br>
Those that ~really~ know me well are the only ones that count. Dipshits like Stehe and Ulwern can flame me all they want and I won't care. You flame my guild, my compadres, my out and out family and you will incur my wrath. I have enough vitriol left to make you hate me just a little bit more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.theradiant.net"><img border="0" src="http://www.theradiant.net/TristSig7.jpg" width="310" height="335"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucyllyan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyllyan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Duracyl the mana battery</span><br>  Posts: 132<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/23/02 5:05:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=534.topic&index=116>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good ole Radiant? eh?</span><hr size=1> Die thread, die...<br>
