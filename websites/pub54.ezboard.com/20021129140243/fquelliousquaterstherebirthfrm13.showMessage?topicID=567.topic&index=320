Me, I'm personally glad that MB got nerfed (sorry Palazious <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Since the MB nerf of 2002, our guild (a mid-sized guild) has managed to kill Gore 2 times and Sev 1 time.  We were able to finally kill some mobs that we've never been able to do before, even though after SOL we finally got enough manpower to do it.  And ya know what...even though most of FE has been playing on Quellious for 2+ years, it felt really REALLY good to experience these kills for the first time.  Content.  Gotta love it. <p><Br><img src="http://home.houston.rr.com/danday/gaeaan/Frankenstein.jpg" border="0">

<br>
I don't agree with the stealing content arguement either but It would be nice if Verant designed more mid end raid encounters so people don't have to fight over this content.. Hopefully with PoP this will be fixed but have been saying that for every expansion. <p><center>

<br>
There's been more than 1 flame on here about someone camping Sev, announcing it in zone, even going so far as to send tells to the MB team that was zoning in.  Yet while the person camping Sev was waiting on his guild/friends to come help tackle Sev the MB teams would burn him anyway.  Then when the flames started up on here, it got chalked up as &quot;miscommunication&quot;.<br>
<br>
FK stated (in this thread) that all Mont would need to do is sit in EJ and camp it by himself.  That he wouldn't need anyone there to help him camp it.  That the MB squads NEVER would run over anyone if they were camping Sev for their epic drop, be it 1 person or a full guild.  Yet, anytime some other person sat there camping Sev by themselves, when they got ran over by an MB crew, the MB crews would post on here shit like &quot;1 person doesn't constitute significant force, we will burn if significant force isn't present&quot;, the good old &quot;learn to mobilize faster and wizzies won't have a chance to burn&quot; (which still cracks me up...Fuggin wizzies on burn channel: Sevs up, who wants to burn.  6 wizzies port into EJ and go burn.  One person camping Sev in guild chat:  Sev's up, let's get in and kill him.  24 ppl in guild that CAN'T port start hollering that they all need a port to EJ from different locations.  Never gonna figure out why the MB squad felt that a guild should be able to mobilize faster than 6 individual porters) and the best yet...wizzies saying that if someone is hollering in ooc and shout that they won't try to burn the mob, yet when the person camping Sev states that he was using ooc and shout the wizzies turn it around to &quot;Well, I leave ooc/shout/auction off, maybe you shoulda sent us a tell when you saw us in the zone&quot; to which the camper replies &quot;Well, I didn't realize you were a group of MB'ers when I do a /who for the zone and everyone of you burners were on /anon /role.&quot;  After that point it turned into mass ego stroking for the wizards when they decided it was a Sev campers job to start sending individual tells to every fuckin wizzy on the server to let em know that Sev was camped, don't burn pls...INSTEAD of MB squads zoning into EJ and just doing a simple fucking &quot;Is Sev camped&quot; in ooc and shout.<br>
<br>
This is in every single MB flame here.  Each time a new flame starts, here comes FK, showing off her quoting skills, valiantly defending MB and all the good it does.  And each Sev spawn we got another flame about how the MB squad ran over another person that was camping Sev and just waiting on the ppl to arrive for the kill.  In the one regarding Wendain from VoR, the MB teams even said that they saw VoR ppl entering the zone, but they didn't feel that it was a significant force so they jumped Sev anyway...<br>
<br>
Ppl from Quellious want to come here and post that MB wasn't being abused on our server.  Yes, it was.  Just because you chose to turn a blind eye to it because the MB squads involved one of your guildies or friends doesn't justify any of the actions that they did.  <br>

<br>
Don't really think I can rebutt that. Though in the earlier days of manaburn the wizards were good intentioned and the guild raid counterparts got their share.. As time progressed  more and more unknown wizards joined the fray and then the monopoly became much more obvious.. Granted I wasn't on enough in the last 1-2 months to see that much of the monopoly but I didn't like what i heard when I was in there.  Frankly I'm glad the ability is gone so I can focus to PoP abilities and forget about the burden that was manaburn.<br>
<br>
I don't think it is right the abuse FK takes but she comes here willingly so I can't help that.. FK was one of those people who I saw did not abuse manaburn and was more like the example on how a wizard should do a manaburn raid.. No greed, always had someone lined up for the epic piece (even the drop ones) and gathered the &quot;good&quot; manaburn wizards who were the ones to worry about.  Taking all your frustrations out on FK isn't right despite what she says because she was the one who was doing the right things.. The wizards people like to talk about that &quot;got manaburn nerfed&quot; never post in the manaburn issue posts nor even visit this board and avoid using the rules the wizards set upon themselves.<br>
<br>
If you want someone to flame It shouldn't be FK..  Flame those who actually caused the problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey seph something reminded me of this.. You had a problem with wizards insta-killing dragons for themselves but what about for the guilds?  There was more than one occasion that guild wizards burned down a dragon for the guild... You feel that is acceptable? <p><center>

You dont understand my point Gae.  I dont care who is killing the dragon, whether it is 1 person or 50 people.  Mobs <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THEIR ABILITIES THAT THEY WERE BALANCED WITH</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->... when a mob dies INSTANTLY, they dont get to use those abilities... so that means 1 32k hp mob = another 32k hp mob.. even if the first one hits for 1, and the 2nd one hits for 5000 and AE's for 2000.... you can't have dynamic content as long as MB existed in its current form. <p><center>

<br>
So how is that different for a guild having 4 wizards criple it so it dies within 10 seconds?<br>

Explain it if i don't understand. <p><center>

And yet Montyy, who said that very same thing, took a scale for something he <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>didn't need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. All the burners on all the servers never once reduced the number of epics that went to warriors who would use them. Yet Montyy's action did just that.<br>

Nice story if only it had happenned.<br>
<br>
I remember 2 incidents during the entire period. One was a misunderstanding, the other appeared to be a case of an overanxious new burner bending the truth to the other burners in his eagerness. Not laudable, but two incedents doesn't constitute a trend.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yet, anytime some other person sat there camping Sev by themselves, when they got ran over by an MB crew, the MB crews would post on here shit like &quot;1 person doesn't constitute significant force, we will burn if significant force isn't present&quot;..

<br>
Not true. Who posted that? The question came up once when the burn team didn't KNOW someone else was camping it.<br>
<br>
I would just be porting people into EJ and would see instantly 'Sev camped by [someguild]' which worked fine. (I felt like saying I'm just passing thru for god's sake) The point was still made and if anyone asked in mb about any particular  dragon they say 'it's camped by vor' or 'its camped by db' or whatever and that's the end of it.<br>
<br>
The truth is, whether you accept reality or not no burn team would have ks'd Montyy, or anyone else for that matter. And didn't.<br>
<br>
You can be sure you would have heard about it.<br>

Grats, but don't get used to it. The people who could farm are busy doing PoP. But they'll be back, and they'll be even more powerful and able to farm with more ease.<br>

I don't have to get used to it.  I don't want to get used to it.  As long as we've killed em, gotten the epic items we need, more power to the next group of ppl that want to take em down.  All I'm saying is that with no MB squad, it's nice to be able to go kill mobs that your guild members need to advance their epics again.  Now 24 ppl don't have to worry about scrambling to beat a group of SELF PORTERS to a mob.  /hug MB nerf<br>

U did time the spawns, u did ask every time u logged on if anything was up, there were others aswell but u were one of the main ones who couldnt get enough burning. You and a few others were the ones that made me stop MBing Kunark dragons other than fun. Sure it was fun, but i deprived others who werent 60 wizzies with 23+ AA the chance to kill these.<br>

Please, admit defeat, i made the channel you and others used to tell each other when a burn mob was up.<br>
