<br>
You can't kill someone with a Colt .45, not unless you throw it at they *really* *really* hard!  Colt Firearms (Hartford, CT) does not manufacture ammunition.  So one would have to say that Remington/etc. was the company that saved the day on that one :^)<br>
<br>
Guns don't kill people, people kill people... err wait<br>
People don't kill people, bullets kill people... err wait<br>
Bullets don't kill people unless they spontaneously explode when in range.. hmm.<br>
<br>
Course it's kinda a bitch to throw a bullet at someone hard enuff to hurt them too, so you could say Colt and Remington helped the officer kill the robber.  What about the retailer that sold the bullet and gun to the police department?<br>
<br>
Sony is a rather large company with a rather large legal department.  They could easily point out that they did not sell that person the software, a retailer did.  Also the electric company supplied the electricity without which he could not have played the game for so long.  I don't think you can sue the electric company if you are a moron and die from electricuting yourself, or can ya?  Well I mean YOU can't cause you're deal hehe, but could your family?<br>
<br>
Can this dork's computer sue Sony because it will no longer have a player to use it?  :^(  So sad... /hug Tron. <p>Master Transkor "<a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96394>LazyChanter</a>" Provocateur, 60 Transmuter.<BR>

<br>
Don't get me wrong anybody-- The last thing I intended to do with this post is to cast blame on the mother here.  I believe 100% that she did everything in her power to protect her son, the guy (who I called a kid earlier, mistakenly) was 21, there was only so much the mother could do.  My intent mainly was to, instead of cast blame, remove the blame totally.<br>
<br>
Things like this happen.  I think I'd be correct to say that every day at least 1, if not more, good person in the world is subject to some bad fate - be it stepping in a mud puddle on accident while on the way to work or, at the far end of the spectrum, committing suicide because they think its the only way out.<br>
<br>
Personally, and I might get a few more Monty Haters for this but, I don't really believe in a higher power-- I roll with the punches one day at a time... I don't know what I'm going to eat for dinner tonight, or what I'll be doing this weekend-- As a matter of fact, I try my best never to schedule any appointments more than a week ahead of me, which much to my disliking, doesnt always happen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I guess what I'm trying to say is, I suck up what life gives me and try to use it the best I can; I think everything happens for a reason, and in the long run, I think every reason equates to something that betters us as a people (well, most stuff ;p).<br>
<br>
What happened to this guy was certainly a very sad thing- but I think the mother should realize that he's in a better place now, wether its flying over the bahama's as a bird in his 2nd life- being free, or maybe he's sitting in a giant bean bag chair eating the food he favored the most at the foot steps of heaven, or maybe he's still here, watching over his mom and family- always.<br>
<br>
/shrug I dunno~  Roll with the punches, look at everything in a positive way, and don't let bad things get you down - ever.<br>
<br>
Carpe Diem!<br>

<br>
Medical research has shown that electronic video games stimulate the same nerve receptors as cocaine or heroine.  Basically....you get a buzz off EQ as you would crack or crank.<br>
<br>
You heart races faster and your body releases the same neuro stimulants when you are excited.....the constant kills...the big raids...it's to give you a rush.   How many times have you killed something and went WOW OMFG that was awesome, you're breathing heavy, your heart feels like it's about to explode?<br>
<br>
That happens to all players supposedly...but with every high, there comes the low.  You crash when someting goes wrong...some people have nothing in their lives to feel good about so when something goes wrong in EQ...it's like a junky coming down off the rush...can't get high again so goes into DTs.   Note extreme depression, paranoia, feelings of worthlessness <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Yes, mom's a loon to think that EQ did this to her kid because most likely, he was already having mental problems. Kids shouldn't be closeted in their rooms with EQ, they should be playing ball, going to school functions, having dates, enjoying life.  How many kids are latch key kids of divorced parents who are too busy &quot;doing their thing&quot; and leaving these kids to be babysat by TV and games because they don't want to be bothered?  But what parent wants to blame themselves or their kids for a death?<br>
<br>
And you say people are just people...no EQ characters are not what people are in RL.  IT'S ROLEPLAYING people !!!!   People will pretend to be what they want to let show.   How many of you are married yet spend numerous hours on here...and you're the guy your guild can count on....but what about your wife, your home, even your sex life?  Your wife or hubby glares at you because you can't do something together...cause OMG you have a raid!!  How many meals have you taken at the comp or worse yet, skipped?  How many of you have laid out of work or school because you played too late.  You kiddies, how many of you have missed assignments and let your grades drop?  And how many of you LIE to RL people about how much you actually play, ashamed of it?.......sound like a druggie to you?   Still nothing wrong with EQ?<br>
<br>
It's not the game, it's the people who choose to play it and their coping abilities.  Kids don't have good coping mechanisms anyway.  They want acceptance.  This kid probably wasn't accepted in RL, and most likely not here...who's post was it about either being a hardcore gamer or a gimp?  If he was an immature kid who constantly begged for attention, he wouldn't have excelled...thus adding more frustration. <br>
<br>
Okay, we say none of us are stupid enough to kill ourselves over EQ....how many RL things do we lose though...relationships, money, friends....what do YOU give up to play EQ?   Not your life as in the living organism...but what about your life as in quality of living?<br>
<br>

I...guess I want to say a few things about RPing since I've been doing it for years and it’s been linked to devil worship and murder.<br>
<br>
Whether you get to know someone in the flesh, on the phone, or through email, you put your best foot forward. The medium (or lack of) facilitating these &quot;meetings&quot; doesn't heighten our desire to make people like us, to draw attention to our good points and diminish the bad until we feel secure enough in their presence to let them see everything there is to see about us. The desire to be liked is part of most everyone; technology, especially a game, didn’t create this need. You (generic for the addlebrained, cough, Xocin) can’t slough this basic, unconscious trait any more than you can stop breathing. This is not roleplaying: <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>this is human nature</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> And EQ is roleplaying.....how many gender benders are there....if that ain't roleplaying what the hell is.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
-- Ari, other post<br>
<br>
I choose not to RP on EQ because the need to communicate across races/classes whenever you want to get something done (XP or raid) dampens my definition of roleplay. I don’t like to mishmash it. I’m either OOC or IC. Something in between would fit my definition of blending. I’m not saying roleplay is impossible, I just don’t like how I have to curb it on EQ.<br>
<br>
As far as EQ goes, some guys started playing female characters well before the release, and may have chosen a female char because in past games, they were faster or harder to hit and the impression stayed with them. &lt;~~ an assumption. Some would rather stare at a nice ass instead of narrow hips. &lt;~~ aesthetic reasons. Some pick females because they think they will have an easier time leveling, getting phat lewtz, etc. (and give real women a bad rep in the process). &lt;~~ greed. These reasons listed are not for roleplaying purposes, and in fact, the latter is just a means to an end.<br>
<br>
I put a hell of a lot of thought into my characters before I enter chat rooms; name, birth, background, phobias? Allergies? Illnesses? Weaknesses? Strengths? Left or right handed? Etc. I know RPers from phonies a number of ways, and none of those clues are taken lightly by the roleplayer I’m observing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontaguethesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montague the Sorcerer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Social Butterfly </span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/15/02 9:20:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=275.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Shawn Woolley's mother is an idiot, I'm sorry...</span><hr size=1> A) This is not a thread about McDonalds<br>

You're right to call my Xocin comment. I don't see any reason to edit it out at this point and apologize. I'm not sure how much hijacking you see in the rest of my post, if any.

More of the same. Apparently EQ is &quot;heroinware&quot;, rofl. These people think WE have no lives?<br>

My fave quotes from this one have to be:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;I had one young man who was trying to get on Social Security disability for agoraphobia,&quot; he said. &quot;He didn't have a mental disorder; he just didn't want to leave 'EverQuest' or instant messaging.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->and the VP of marketing for SOE saying:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;You don't see disclaimers when you get in a car saying 'Don't run over people.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
