Wraith disbanded primarily because of disparate timezones. It crippled us. Half the guild was Euro and these guys ended up waiting longer for raids to start (to get enough to engage) and hence also staying up late day after day. We eventually couldn't work around that issue. As far as I remember Wraith was holding it's own quite well at the time it disbanded and had recently done some server firsts (Statue, Jorlleag, Ikatiar, PoM, etc.). Point being, dont flatter yourself. VM had nothing to do with Wraith's originally disbanding.<br>
<br>
Raluvin,<br>
<br>
I agree the original Wraith had some extremely skilled players, and a bunch of them are in VM / LC now. As far as comparison, I'd say we hold our own and you unfortunately can't compare since you used to be in old Wraith and you haven't raided with us in the new one. Our accomplishments speak for themselves. <br>

Hrm, well. I think personally with the arriving of luclin certain aspects of the game changed alot, one thing that changed was that a &quot;normal sized&quot; raidforce (per vis maiors definition) changed from a top of mayhaps 40 45 up towards a number of even so much as 70+, vis maior just dont have, nor have vis maior ever have that kind of numbers.<br>
<br>
I often do a /who in zones I am in, and I frequently see both lc and wraith/reviv with number counts of 80 and more. <br>
<br>
So naturally it hurt a little, I for one dont sit and bite my nails at evening and I dont believe any of the other vm members do either and think &quot;omg what if X guild kills this before us&quot;.<br>
<br>
As for accomplishments in this expansion, hrm well..there has been many members and many old friends of mine that left the guild, and I hope they found their fun elsewhere, right now there are perhaps out of the 40 45 I used to know, perhaps 6 members left of the crew I was running with.<br>
<br>
Still only have 2 mobs left to kill in Luclin, I dont think its a superbad record, rebuilding takes time.<br>
<br>
And Desi, what accomplishments have Wraith actually made on their own lately?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time,<br>

<br>
that's just my observation.  if wraith wasn't pushing so hard to beat VM, you think timezone would be a problem? i still remember what wraith tried to do to beat VM to mobs..sit in DN for 2 days to wait for zland to pop, sit in ww for hrs to wait for kland to pop, sit in icewell to wait for dain to pop, etc etc.  those really..hmm...faustred a lot of wraith members.  Add in all the training and trash talking between both guilds.  End up having tons of ppl quit EQ/guild from both guilds during that period.  Both guilds were hurt badly that time.  Took Vm a very long time to rebuild. And wraith finally call it quit because ppl didn't feel like having fun and stop logging in (o well..there were some internal problems too).  Maybe that's just me, but I really think Wraith pushed their members away by trying too hard to beat VM.  <br>
<br>
Anyway..that's some history and my opinion as a VM at that time, you don't have to agree with me. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uturkee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Turkee </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sebilite Guardian</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/3/02 10:40:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=557.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Somewhere out there, Stylee is smiling............</span><hr size=1> Woow describes my view during that timeperiod perfect. <br>
<br>
In your defense Desi, I will agree, when you guys pulled off Statue, and Zland, and got extremely close on Yelinak, right on the heels of us doing it (minus Statue) I started to worry that Wraith was actually gonna catch up to us. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately a few key Wraith members quit. That was for the most part, the end of the Wraith vs. Vis saga. <br>
<br>
In my opinion, although I didnt stick around much longer after that all happen, Vis got lazy without Wraith around, never worried about Lotus really, then wham out of nowhere, hey there goes Lotus zipping right by. <br>
<br>
Throw in a few other key factors with Lotus and Vis history, and well, you've heard all of this before from someone. <br>
<br>
I dont know about the numbers that you're putting at raids Desi, but I will say that regardless if you use 200 people or not (and yah I would give ya a hard time about it in game) but regardless of anything, if you kill a mob, you kill a mob. <br>
<br>
So as you put it, cheers, to your success. <br>

I don't think it was that...  Occy left because it was time to go correct?  Most people can't raid constantly for years on a consistant basis. Also people get burned out.<br>
<br>
In most cases when a guildleader leaves a guild the guild will struggle or fail.. Vis struggled for a bit then Luclin hit and suddenly most guilds needed to double their raid roster to raid luclin.. Vis did this faster than others because they wanted to maintain a good pace.. invited some  questionable players then eventually a large section of the guild moved on because they were tired of failing due to the questionable players.<br>
<br>
That correct?<br>
<br>
Desaran,<br>
<br>
Descent fell apart directly because of Vis.. Kalsto wanted to beat Vis to the top and the guild wasn't ready so he left.<br>

I don't think that's the case, Gae. He did have the second guild, Antiquity. I was in it. I remember Dachunker and Aspro being in it, Spiritjazz, I think Zenfe and Xaliya, Saelamdar and Staboo, damn, who else? When he told me about it he said the goal was a smaller, tighter guild.<br>
<br>
And he's anything but retired. Pop onto Sullon Zek and check out guild Vindictive. <p><center>

Wraith disbanded for our own reasons, and most of it was burn out. Yours truly even tried to kick the EQ habit for a bit and was unsuccessful, and tried to let someone take the guild over. Had nothing to do with VM, nothing to do with LC, nothing to do with anyone else besides ourselves. Also, these raids you talk about us waiting days and hours just to get the mob to spawn. Damn where was I? I dont recall waiting for one mob at all, all I remember was racing to a mob. But since I guess you know so much better than I do, I guess that must be true. Other than that Im not here to bash VM or compare whos done what. Vm does their thing we do ours, LC does theirs. All ill say is the high end guilds are a hell alot more civil then what they were ever before. And no I dont claim to be a part of that either im not that level headed and cool tempered, I cause more waves than anything.<br>
<br>
As for old Wraith and new Wraith. Since you like to comment on that, I recall being called &quot;zergs&quot; in old wraith as well. And if all we do is throw warm bodies at certain mobs (because thats all we are is numbers and no skill right?)  explain how we succeed? I can name quite a few high end encounters that will punish you if all you do is zerg them. One of those encounters has also only been completed by us on this server.<br>
Old wraith had its share of great players to, hence Raging Fury on AB. Majority of them are there, and are one of the top guilds on the most crowded server in EQ. But New Wraith has far outdone what old Wraith did, and since i was at the start of both and I will be at the end of both im probably the most qualified to make that judgment. And against the popular opinion, both old and new have some pretty damn good players in it.<br>
<br>
As for guild leaders being a key part of a guild, it goes far deeper than that I assure you, good guild leaders are surrounded by good officers. Occy ran you guys into the ground in my opinion, keyword being &quot;opinion&quot; as I was not a part of VM and never will be. Occy and VM pulled some of those most manipulating and kniving things ive ever heard of to people on this server, and yes I was on the recieving end of some of them. Yea that got you to the top and kept ya there for a bit, and if your proud of gettin there the way you did more power to you. Does that mean Occy wasnt good at leading a guild? By no means, he set out to accomplish and he did, he did what he thought it took to win. He knew how to motivate his guild and thats a key part of winning.<br>
<br>
Whoever LisaW71 is, I guess you been living in a hole the past 8 or so months if you havent caught a drift of what weve done. If your meaning since we are allied with Revivisence and that discounts what weve done, guess thats your perrogative. Between both guilds we have fewer tagged people on raids than both VM and LC does. Adding works wonders when you know how to do it.  Yet we are called the Zergs, make sense to everyone but us, oh well doesnt bother me none the least other than a good laugh from time to time. I think alot of resentment towards Wraith/Rev comes from the rate we advanced at. Like we didnt pay our dues or some such. Anyway props to Darkoor and crew trying to get that keep guild kicking, youve lasted longer than I thought you would when things started heading downhill. ANd as for VM haters I think my and Kalsto are on the same level, tho I cant say that its VM I dislike anymore, being that majority of the assholes I disliked went to Explicit. But thats a whole nother story.<br>

Left ADD for it, didnt know what the hell was going on. Kalsto was playing his warrior at the time, forget it off hand. I recruited with Descent for, pfft god i dont know how long, 6 or 7 months, and then when they finally fell in May of 01 he formed that guild and invited me into it. i felt like he was doing me a favor or trying to apologise, all i remember is that we would farm CDok over and over again for his warrior, other warriors and cleric epic. then i remember he DBed us and said &quot;start groupin with wraith were merging&quot; and the rest was history i guess. Gael is right, for someone who has been off quellious along time now, his name still is brought up frequently. I agree with Galiana also, He wanted descent to rize to the top, and be where Vis is now but no one was really ready for that so he left. I dont know, there is alot i can say on this subject. but its better left alone, past is the past, the future is now. <br>

<br>
I meant that since he left the server.<br>
<br>
He disbanded the guild because VM beat us to Velketor on the next day after our first VP raid (big deal back then)<br>
<br>
I wasn't shocked then but now that you think of it.. How could he do that so fast?  It may not have been due to VM directly probably more likely that he was demanding way too much out of his members.. (made a ranger twink to avoid the guild when I wanted).  Its not a knock to him just stating the facts.<br>
<br>
Many guilds have risen and failed due to the race to catch up with VM and having their people burn out.<br>
<br>
Now Woow don't allow your ego to turn into an Arkinia.. Its not healthy. <p><center>

Vis went ahead and killed Velk that day. <br>
<br>
Lisa is Yoza Droz. <br>
<br>
I do remember you guys waiting at mobs Droz, as Woow said, but I do remember us waiting 6-8 hours at Dain and a couple other things as well. I showed up at like 10am, and fell asleep when it was actually time for Dain. I remember thinking wow, look at all our warriors, because we had like 10 Vis warriors show up that day, and until the Ntov days, that was unusual. (Back when Moho was our only war a raid or two) <br>
<br>
lol.. i dont recall, but I think that might have been the Dain that Occy played Buud for, and haha, i remember Occy saying something along the lines of &quot;omg this sucks. Ok everybody sit down in a circle in front of me, when I buff you, get up and go away from the group&quot; It was funny if you were there. :P<br>

<br>
His warrior's name was Tobrin, btw, and he ebayed one on SZ. Hell of a warrior, too, female inky loaded with gear. I think he plays her as much or more than his wiz.<br>
<br>
Dunno why the griping about farming Chardok, a lot of people came out with epics, it wasn't just for Kal. I was there when Dominick (another Antiquity alumnus) got his light sabers. All he needed was the Queen's blade to finish it. But shit, did we wipe out a lot that night. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><center>

<br>
Looking back, it was a nice roster that Kalsto had, all of them just werent near as uber as they are now. If only Dabo could see the main tank that Chunker became heh. I remember when I was new to Descent, everybody treated Dabo like he was the end-all god-tank.  I think Chunker was only 52 or so then, Chunker got invite about 1-2 weeks before me. And Faie and the other bard were both like 1 day before me. I remember Nida saying &quot;we had no bards, then next day 3&quot;<br>
<br>
Neat to see we had one member joined FoH and another joined Afterlife. <br>
<br>
later on, <br>

<br>
Hence my comment that I often see Wraith/Revi as well as Lotus Cult with alot more numbers than what Vis Maior currently have.<br>
<br>
Nor once did I mention any &quot;Zergs&quot;, I was merely commenting on that it must be good to have &quot;another guild&quot; as well to have along, since as a matter of fact certain mobs do require alot of numbers. <br>
<br>
*Points to the above comment with 94 wraith/revi in Ssra.*<br>
<br>
Dont get me wrong, Id love to have 94 Vis Maior. <br>
<br>
As Chikkin said, to me it doesnt matter how many you use, be it 5 or 95, as long as you have fun ja?<br>
<br>
But wtf, this is a flame board init?<br>
<br>
So bring it on &quot;Zeus&quot; you know you love it..<br>
<br>
Kindly, <br>
