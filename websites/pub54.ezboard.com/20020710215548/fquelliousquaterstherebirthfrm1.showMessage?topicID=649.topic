What I know: It's an area of effect thing, maybe a 45 degree arc in front of the mob. You don't have to hit the mob to get caught in the rampage (it's not like a summons). Whoever is within reach, regardless of where you may be on the hate list, will get clunked on the head repeatedly with a cast iron pan until the mob stops its rampage. A lot of tanks get in the habit of fighting high end mobs either from the side or a blind spot. <p><center><imgsrc="http://drowlings.keenspace.com/quiz/vaeldrenn.gif"><br><ahref="http://www.selectsmart.com/FREE/select.php?client=drowlings">What Drowlings character am I?</a> by <ahref="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=kuruma"><imgheight="17" border="0"src="http://img.livejournal.com/userinfo.gif" align="absmiddle"width="17"></a><b><ahref="http://www.livejournal.com/users/kuruma/">kuruma</a></b><center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 5/26/02 12:35:52 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uminitankstylee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MinitankStylee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 151<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/26/02 12:36:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would you talk to me bout rampage?</span><hr size=1> It's been a long time since I've raided, but isn't rampage when the monster ripostes everything?

Rampage itself goes off as a proc (like flurry), so cripple or other dex debuffs make it happen less.<br><br>The rampage list itself is a finite number long, and no one *really* knows how it works.  As well as I know, it is based largely on the order of engagement, when someone dies they are taken off the list and the highest person on the hate list (but not on the rampage list) is added.  People often claim to be on the rampage list, then die, get ressed, and are still on it - this is a coincidence with other people dieing and low-hp agro bumping you to the top of the hate list when the new person is chosen for the rampage list, I think.  The rampage list may not be updated automatically either, perhaps only when a rampage goes off (which would also explain zoning out and coming back still on rampage list).  There are exceptions to all of this, of course, which is why there is no definite answer that I have ever seen. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5794">Bippity</a> Hierophant / <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=27969">Gobbo</a> 59 Warrior<br><br>Quellious</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uqutsemnie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/26/02 1:45:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would you talk to me bout rampage?</span><hr size=1> edit: this was posted while bipp was posting. didnt see her comments.<br><br>i dunno but your question made me think of some better google searches i pulled this out of steel warriors faq<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>What are rampage and flurry?<br>Rampage is an extra attack from a mob that strikes those highest on the hate list.

It is possable to leave th list if you can drop aggro . easiest way to whack rampage is to have MT engage, and three other people with lotsa hp run up and /kick it once ... Rampage list is seperated from hate list, you cant become lower on it unless you have an agrro reduction spell/skill .<br><br>I beleive all my info is correct ..... if im wrong, point it out =D <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ueadrictheranger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eadric the Ranger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/26/02 9:38:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would you talk to me bout rampage?</span><hr size=1> that's pretty solid info, Acturian.  whether the rampage list is 4 people deep or what, i'm not so certain.  in my experience it seems to vary with the level of the mob.  <br><br>- the rampage list IS related to the hate list, moreso than order of engagement.  sometimes i sit out longer than most, healing the MT or whatever, because i'm a ranger and don't like getting hit.  when i come in i still get rampaged on (because of the damn proc on earthcaller mostly).  if a cleric gets on rampage list, it is likely due to early CHs.  all of this is of course only speculation based on my experience <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>- mobs can rampage on you no matter where you are. if you are behind them, they can still rampage you, without turning to look at you.  <br><br>- rampages add one extra attack per target on the rampage list.  it's not to be confused with Enrage, which causes the mob to riposte all frontal attacks.<br><br>that's what i have observed about it.  if anyone has any hard facts i would be interested to hear them.<br><br><br><br><br> <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101332>Eadric Elfstone</a><BR>Warder of Karana<BR><a href=http://pub31.ezboard.com/fradiance88931>Radiant</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/27/02 9:47:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would you talk to me bout rampage?</span><hr size=1> &quot;mobs can rampage on you no matter where you are. if you are behind them, they can still rampage you, without turning to look at you.&quot;<br>-- Eadric<br><br>Never seen that one. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uacturian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Acturian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/27/02 1:32:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=649.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Would you talk to me bout rampage?</span><hr size=1> I have es, i remember being on vindi's rampage list (jolt not sticking /sigh) for quite some time before jolts stuck, i was BEHIND vindicator (cause at the time i was a wimp =) ) and i was getting hit with rampage.<br><br>You can get on ramp. list, and run away and you'll get hit.
