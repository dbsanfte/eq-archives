<br>
To Get The Rez You Need From Me:<br>
<br>
1.  Take off ANON.  Nothing steams my clams faster than someone who is ANON demanding help from someone who isn't.  Make yourself as available for assistance as I have made myself.  I won't rez you if you are ANON, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
2.  Greet me.  Say &quot;Hello!&quot; and wait for a response.  I don't care WHAT kind of rush you are in, you CAN'T be running that late where you cannot give someone a salutation in preparation for your next request.  It not only helps set the tone of the conversation but it's a welcome relief from the standard &quot;rez me dood?&quot; lines I receive at all hours of the night.<br>
<br>
3.  Speak in complete sentences, with capitalization, punctuation and conjugation.  Or at least make the effort.  I have been role-playing my cleric for 60 levels, asking druids, shamen and rangers for SoW my entire life.  &quot;Greets, good sir.  Would you care to swap buffs, please? I've far to travel and am in need of your Spirit of Wolf spell. I'll give you Resolution in return.&quot;  After said transaction, I always follow up with &quot;Thank you and safe travels&quot; or something of the sort.  I make the experience enjoyable and profitable for the recipient of my request. <br>
<br>
4.  Don't, don't, don't drag a corpse and deposit it in front of me when I'm in a group.  I don't have a rez stick and I'm not about to drop 600 mana on you and jeopardize the group's safety.  That's just rude of you to expect me to make five others med to cover up your mistake.  Drag to the zone and wait for me or someone else to help you at OUR leisure.<br>
<br>
5.  Don't assume all clerics will drop what they are doing for that 100 plat you are offering for a rez.  You can add a zero to the right side of that number and it still won't turn my &quot;No, I'm sorry but I just don't have the time&quot; answer into a &quot;Sure! Where's the body?&quot;.  I rez for free if it's not taking up a lot of my time but don't expect my time to be YOUR time all the time.  Got it? &lt;lol&gt;<br>
<br>
6.  I spend no less than 45 min each night helping people, both those I know and those I don't.  If you knock on my door at the 46th minute, then you are unlucky.  &quot;I'm sorry but I gave at the office.&quot;  You're going to have to look for another cleric.  I can't cure all the woes of the world.<br>
<br>
7.  If you see a cleric &quot;/OOCing WTB a port to XX zone&quot; over and over again and you aren't horribly busy, help him or her out.  We save other peoples' butts all the time - waiting for us to offer 50 plat out of desperation to get a ride just isn't cool.  When I have to offer 50 plat for a ride, I always turn the first person down.  Screw them for waiting until I offer up some serious bucks for help.  I'll take the slowest response as my client, thank you.<br>
<br>
8.  Buy a stack of peridots and keep them in your backpack.  Want to get a rez fast? Offer a cleric a handful of these peridots (10.5p each) in exchange for his service.  That's the only reason I ever go to town - to deposit money in the gem-vendors pockets.  If I could get Peridots instead...? Wow... major supply problem solved.<br>
<br>
9.  &quot;I died from LD.. can I get a quick rez?&quot;  Don't lie.  There is no way in *hell* that every one of the last 73 rez requests I've recieved were for people who have been killed by &quot;lag or linkdeath&quot;.  You and I both know you screwed up.  Admit it.  You got stunned and the quad-kiters caught up to you.  You made a mistake and now you need help.  I die *all* the time.  And I've died some really DUMB deaths.  Nothing to be ashamed of - embrace it.. laugh it off.. and move on.<br>
<br>
10. Last but not least, give us a tell once in a while just to say hello!!  To see how I'm doing.  I'm a pretty good conversationalist - I take pride in my command of the language.  Don't let every conversation I have with someone I don't know go like this:<br>
<br>
Stranger_03: Are you a cleric?<br>
Daku:  In which zone is your corpse?<br>
Stranger_03: How did you know I was going to ask for a rez?<br>
Daku:  I'm gifted that way.  &lt;Grin&gt;  I've been doing this for a while... I can sense an impending Corpse-O-Gram from a mile away.<br>
<br>
Follow these guidelines and give your local cleric a hug once in a while and you'll very rarely get declined a REZ!!!<br>

Ya know not all druids are like this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I also think ya could replace &quot;rez&quot; with &quot;port&quot; or &quot;buff&quot; and have the same general message.  You wouldn't believe how many people expect you to change your bind point or do a long run just for a conveniance for them.  Not to mention, ports are 300 mana there and an additional 150 or 300 back not even counting running time to get back to where I was.  That's a huge chunk of mana.  I know if I go anon or roleplay it will cut down these requests, but that's something I do only in newbie zones (where the amount of begging greatly intensifies).  I could care less about giving out SoW if the person asking is polite (and no, plz is not polite - if you are asking someone to do something for you don't be too lazy to spell out please because they might be too lazy to cast that spell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), but SLN (300), Chloro (200), Thorns (120), and SoW (40 bleh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )?

Gaelron?  Why the heck are you even mentioning us wizards?  I mean... cmon.... get real.  There isnt a single class in this game that gets abused like clerics.  Sure, Daku mentioned the amount of mana that it takes to rez... but even then, he omitted the additional mana that he (and all other considerate clerics spend on a rez).  Most clerics I know will rez, Celest Heal, and then drop on a buff or two to keep you safe until the rez effects wear off (which is a true blessing to casters like myself who dont survive very long when oom).  <br>
<br>
Don't EVEN try to compare us to clerics or whine about port mana.  At level 51+, any self-respecting wizard should have at LEAST 200 INT, and that adds up to a boat-load of mana.  Add to that your specializations, and you can port all day long (without clarity), and prolly never go oom (ok... maybe that's a wee far-fetched... but not by much).  Additionally, with xlocates, you dont even need to leave a zone... so don't complain about zone times.  When I've been approached for a port (and I'm either busy or just dont feel like zoning), I just tell them that I'm only xlocating.  I have yet to hear complaints.  <br>
<br>
I guess what I'm trying to say is that ports are a dime-a-dozen.  You (as a porter) can easily say no to a request.  When you do, the person will usually just run to the nearest tree and tap a druid on the shoulder.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   When a person is seeking a rez, they are always desperate... and will nag a known cleric relentlessly for a rez.  We can get away with saying that we are busy.  Clerics usually can't.<br>
<br>
Hey Daku... how many times have you gotten that rez request that you couldnt fulfill for whatever reason... only to be spammed with begging, pleading, and finally outright abuse... and 10-15 minute tirades as to how selfish Clerics are cause they wont rez someone?<br>
<br>
Bottom line here... dont insult clerics by trying to compare yourself to them, Gaelron.  You aren't in their league.  None of us are.<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
/tell Daku D00d!  While I was typing this, I got keeled and lost me level.  I need joo to fine me corpse and rez me!  I got 50pp on me corpse!  You KNOW you need it!  And make sure to SoW me, 2!  Btw... which way to Burned Woods...<br>

I forgot about those eggs. &lt;grin&gt; You're welcome.. glad I could help you.<br>
<br>
Sachem - Yup.  At this stage of the game, cash has very little value.<br>
<br>
Lalian - Absolutely. I am friends with several OUTSTANDING druids and I've nothing against the class.  I'm just reporting the class make-up of my clientele. &lt;grin&gt;<br>
<br>
Gaelron - I'm sure Wizzies and Druids all have their share of woes... and it's not easy being a porting class.  But how many requests do YOU get asking that you go from East Commons down to Lower Guk to rez someone?  Or out to Seafury Cyclops island in OOT?  The difference between a port and a rez is... the corpse will NEVER come to YOU.  &lt;wink&gt;<br>
<br>
Quas - Heya!  How's MOPS?  Ya, I have tons of sad stories from all over Norrath.  Here's one of my favorites (recalling from memory, so it's not 100% accurate) from early one morning when I had stayed home from work:<br>
<br>
Druid_53: Hi.. are you very, very busy?<br>
Daku: Greets.  No, not very *very* busy, just killing some stuff in Karnors.<br>
Druid_53:  This is my boyfriend's account and I was trying to powerlevel my warrior in Oasis when a bunch of Specs killed my boyfriend's druid.  He lost his level...<br>
Druid_53:  And he's gonna be home in about 30 min and will kill me if he finds out that he lost 54.  Can I get a Rez from you?  You're the only 56 cleric who will speak to me.<br>
<br>
Daku shakes his head...<br>
<br>
How the HELL do you say &quot;no&quot; to that person?  Even if they aren't telling the truth, it's a great &quot;tug on your heart-strings&quot; excuse.  Ahahaha.<br>

We all carry a burden with our abilities... Especially Wizards after a raid.. Getting like 30 tells for Translocate and most of them to WC using up a stack of Portal Fragments.. But with that added bonus of being a cleric you get all the groups you want while im sitting lfg in a zone or soloing..<br>

Groups want you and they dont want us..<br>

I immensely enjoyed reading it.  I am familiar with your name because I, too, joined the many legions of rez beggers, but luckily I have the same rules you mentioned burned in my mentality.  I never ask for sows/rezzes/ports without greeting and asking politely, and if declined (as was the case when I asked you for rez) I never get mad.  I just can't understand people getting upset and especially being rude when someone won't go out of their way to help them!  If rejected I just say thank you anyway, safe travels, etc etc.<br>
<br>
However, you are now on my friend's list because you mentioned to me that you can produce an Othmir's Cap or something of that nature which I could really use for my cleric, so I will get in touch with you when I'm not so broke and can afford to spend 1k on him.<br>
<br>
I would like to add, and I will probably get flamed for this, that I do not have too much sympathy for clerics being bothered for rezzes, and here's why.  I believe most people make clerics and pursue them to a high level simply because they like to help people.  My first character in EQ (after my 6 month haitus) was a cleric, which I made because I like to help people.  If you inspect him it says &quot;If you need buffs or heals give me a tell, I will do what I can.&quot;  Yesterday I was in EC with him and some level 19 paladin was looking for a rez in Befallen.  So, I ran over there to find out he had falled down the well by Skeleton Lrodd AND ran away THEN died hehehe.  So I sat there for awhile pondering what to do.  Bound myself at entrance, ITU'ed, dropped down the well (first time I've been past floor 1 of Befallen), pulled body to bottom of well, gated, ITU'ed again, back to well, /corpse from top of well, pull to zone, rez, heal, buff.  Not trying to exemplify myself, just demonstrating how fun it is for people who like to play clerics to go on rezzing adventures, whereas others would consider it a tremendous hassle and waste of time.  But I do see how it is frustrating when people act like jerks about it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this post is long enough.  Thanks for the laughs, and I will be sure to stock up on dots next time I'm in town because that was a good suggestion.  <br>

I never send random tells for rezzes. I'd rather ask a friend whom I know, or have grouped with, to aid me. I try to keep it mutual too. I've been to more than a few Ixablat raids, a ton of Ragefire raids, and some interesting explorations of zones, pulling corpses for people.<br>
