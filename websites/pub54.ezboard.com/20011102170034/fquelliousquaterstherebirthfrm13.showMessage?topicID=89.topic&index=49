<br>
I am wondering what your after Gaelron you have talked yourself into the room and out of the room over your own thread. <br>
<br>
First you say I am calling NP trainers. Then you say it does not matter cause we where not sure they even did it.<br>
<br>
Then you say people called you bad names, but you have no log to support it, and the log NP supplied showed they treated you very civil, and only in guild chat do they call sinirab a bad name.<br>
<br>
You tell us to leave Sinirab out of this? How can we do this, the person was there they escalted the situation, they have a bad rep, Sinirab is known for &quot;extremes&quot; you yourself have admitted that, but you keep her around cause she pulls good. All the &quot;bad names&quot; I saw in the log where directed at Sinirab. So this can't be excluded just cause it does not help your cause.<br>
<br>
You tell us to not to mention Luftacos, We all know his Accusations helped calm the situation down. Not!, it made it worse. So he can't be excluded just on the basis it makes your raid look bad.<br>
<br>
So over all your so right cause you say so, but you don't have any proof and all your arguments can't even stay straight enough to get a valid point here. You can't even make up your mind on what your fighting over. <br>
<br>
You have come down to one point now, its all you have left. Is that NP contested us taking a camp from them, they are bad they should have just let us take it from them.<br>
<br>
Give us a break Gaelron, next time attack bunnies, you might fair well against them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utovarichjones.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tovarich Jones</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/5/01 9:40:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Norrath's Pride or lack therof</span><hr size=1> How would RiP's case hold up in a court of law (just for grins)? Let's look at the evidence<br>
<br>
QUOTE:<br>
&quot;Yes its all true! I love to loot no drop items I cant use! Please invite me to hate some time. im working on a full set of rune etched.. i love to loot quest armor too and MQ it for cash! Plz invite me to all your raids, i dont want stuff i can use, only no drop stuff i cant!!! &quot;<br>
EVIDENCE: <br>
Sirinab auctioning MQ for Pegasus cloak in GD<br>
VERDICT:<br>
Sirinab's attempt at sarcasm falls flat on its face - Rel In Por case not going well...<br>
<br>
QUOTE:<br>
&quot;Why do you keep bringing up Sirinab? It was my raid don't mention Sirinab again..&quot;<br>
EVIDENCE:<br>
The first member of your guild to interact with us was Sirinab - by attacking a Mob we had pulled, and then attempting to Ninja loot a spear to which she had no right.<br>
VERDICT:<br>
This is sort of like the Oliver North defense isn't it? &quot;The buck stops here with me&quot; - how selfless of Gaelron to try to protect Sirinab from the repercussions of her own statements.<br>
No-one really believed Ollie North back then - Gaelron isn't faring much better.  Rel In Por accusations starting to look even more flimsy than they did before Gaelron started doing his best impersonation of a politician.<br>
<br>
QUOTE:<br>
&quot;Luftacos was mad that someone in your group destroyed a shaman spear that he could use..&quot;<br>
&quot;...what Luftacos must have said I dont care thats a minor issue...&quot;<br>
EVIDENCE:<br>
Sorry Gaelron, you can't have it both ways - either you want to make an issue of the spear or you don't.  <br>
VERDICT:<br>
Had a Shaman spear dropped, it would have been given to a member of Norrath's Pride who could make use of it. Since no-one in NP wanted the SK Spear, then it became the property of the group to do with as they wished -we elected to destroy it. In addition, Sirinab never asked - she attempted to Ninja Loot - something everyone in Rel In Por wants to try to convince everyone never happened....<br>
<br>
QUOTE:<br>
&quot;...moving over someone elses camp isn't against the rules either but it definitaly isn't a cool thing to do.&quot;<br>
EVIDENCE:<br>
Iuldiin makes the first accurate statement by anyone associated with Gaeron's raid.  There are unwritten rules on the server that players abide by - one of them does recognize the existence of &quot;camps&quot; - if no-one abides by this rule why do people /shout and /ooc &quot;Camp Check&quot; whenever they enter a higher-level zone in which they wish to hunt?  It's common courtesy to respect the rights of the people who spent the time to reach and secure an area first - and everyone on the server knows it.<br>
VERDICT:<br>
Rel In Por case going down in flames - their own raid members admitting that they behaved with little regard for others in the zone.<br>
<br>
But since not one person in RiP is able to provide any contradictory evidence....since their log files are too big, or they formatted their hard drive, or the dog ate the computer - is it any wonder that RiP is getting a lousy reputation because of their members who choose to attempt to flame without evidence? <p><img src = "http://www.protectorsofknowledge.com/images/TovarichJones.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwolfsonjakk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WolfsonJakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/5/01 10:02:58 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Norrath's Pride or lack therof</span><hr size=1> I have raided with Norath's Pride many times and have found them to be nothing but honorable folk. Our guild has recently had a very tense incident with Sirinab on the other hand, just recently. Mistakes were made and in the end it cost us a good guildmate. If Rel in Por are so honorable why is she still with them? <br>
<br>
Maybe she and Staboo could start a new guild...<br>
