class=m><span class=title> Your Character History?</span><hr size=1> One of the on going topic in my guild has to do with Character History.  So I guess I am sharing with you some of Llorac's history, and in turn hope you all will share yours with me.<br>
<br>
I started EQ in May of 2000.  I was, and still am a newbie in many ways. I  made Llorac as a half elf Paladin my first attempt.  After all.. I was  laboring under this misconception that a Paladin can heal AND fight WELL.  This is like D&amp;D right?  Got totally lost in FP.. DELETE. <br>
<br>
Then I made a half elf druid in Surefall.. I misread the maps and thought it  was Qeynos.  I drowned many times.. can't get out at all.. I was hopelessly lost.. And then someone told me to make a wood elf druid instead... DELETE. <br>
<br>
Then I made a wood elf druid.. promptly fall off and died... DELETE <br>
<br>
Back to the half elf Paladin in FP.  At least I am on firm ground! <br>
<br>
Started Llorac again on Quellious when some Diablo guildies I have lost to  EQ told me to go to Quellious.  Hey, I was a grand lvl 5 when I deleted  Llorac on Mith Marr.. I had some leather and all and was so proud of <br>
myself..  *batwing/bonechips* baby~ <br>
<br>
I remember roaming through EC in the dark, lost and unable to see. I lost my corpse and thought I was doomed... Then some dwarf called Vageto lead me around. Vageto was one of the nicest guy ever to a new and lost player, I will always remember him fondly for that.  I remember Maximal too.. and his cleric Kebler (35!?!?! surely a god).. he was the guy who taught me about hot keys and made me hit sense directions over <br>
and over again.. Every time he sees me, &quot;how is your sense direction  Llorac?&quot;  He was the guy who helped me see also.  &quot;Do you know about Clip planes Llorac?&quot;  And then I started to jump up and down,  &quot;Eh??  OMG, I can see!!!&quot; <br>
<br>
I remember meeting Tyna's bard called Tynatoo. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Vageto, her and I got loyally drunk in NFP.  They are the reason I kept up my alcohol tolerance. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I remember Bloodson(diablo guildie and lvl 35 necro at the time) babying me along with Asakura.  They are my EQ mentors and spoiled me ROTTEN.  I remember my other diablo guildies too.. but they have since left the game.. I stilll say hi to Osma once a while, she always have time to chat with me.  Kenya I remember fondly too, he always take the time to show me around and even helped me so much with the awful MM granite camp.<br>
<br>
I get lost a lot.. I mean ALOT..  Even more so back when I was young  I remember at lvl 18.. hearing about these fabled Shin greaves and being told I am not KoS to the living frogs.. So I matched onward to Guk.. got  hopelessly lost.. and Moya tried to lead me out and I almost killed him.. since I don't know how to swim.. <br>
<br>
Rashida, a lvl 40 necro (diabolo guildie) had to come drag my corpse out and  lead me to LGuk to loot it.  I was so scared of losing my BI leggings and all my nice items... I also promised her I won't go near Guk until I was 30+.  In fact, I hated Guk for a long long time because of that accident. I wish I had kept in touch with Rashida.. I had forgotten her other characters names. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
At 19th.. I heard about South Karanas and Asakura(47(?) wizard at the time, too me there.  I remember running with him through North Karana and South Karana thinking EQ was just beautiful.  Since I did not know how to swim well, we had to boat to the Arena...  I will always remember sailing across Lake Rathe with him telling me stories. I miss him to this very day... He always had time to chat with me, always watching me and guard me over the distance along with Bloodson.  <br>
<br>
On a side note, I never really learned how to swim until I was in my 30's. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I did go back to LGuk at 27th when Swollef(whose twink Ogre warrior I met in HHk) took me back there for a pair.  I remember falling into the water, getting stuck down until a Guide came to summon me out.  I was scared, but Swollef stayed with me while I panic and whine.  For some reason, that crazy fellow keep on calling me CarolL. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Little did I know his name came from his last name flipped. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I remember Glendarin too.  He was a high elf Paladin who always had time to give me advice and talk to me.  Real life took him away too.  Thanks to you Glen, I was able to meet Penroc. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    She is the sweetest Paladin alive.  Oh the adventure Penroc and I used to get into...  Remember how we used to turn heads Penroc? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Two shinny female half elf Paladins... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Around lvl 29, I met a high lvl at HHK. He and I never did hunt together due to our lvl and guild.  I still want to say, that brief time I spend in HHK getting to know the real you was one of the nicest time in my EQ life.   You have gone from EQ, but you are remembered fondly by me always despite the fact we were no longer close toward end of your EQ life.  To this day, I still carry your gift to me when I turned 30th lvl.  <br>
<br>
I remember sharing Asakura's first Fear raid with him through guildchat.  I remember thinking that maybe one day.. I will be able to follow him to the planes..<br>
<br>
I ventured into Kurnak at lvl 31, I was so bored of Highkeep.  My first trip into FM, I managed to win a forest loop!!!  My first piece of phat lewt ever!  To this day I have it still.  My little druid still uses and treasure <br>
it.  But then, I died on my way back to FM.  That's where I met Opalmoon(I grouped with her the night before), Lalian and Satureja.  Lalian and Satureja were the sweetest couple ever.  I miss seeing them still to this day. The 3 of them helped me CRed my body.  I was so lost and clueless in the outdoors then. (heck, I am still lost and clueless. :P  Just it's alot harder to kill me now then before.) One of my BIG EQ regret is letting a jerk tear Lalian, Satureja and I apart.  But I have myself to blame for that.  I let a person get in the way of the most important thing in EQ.. friendship.<br>
<br>
Around lvl 33 I was kitting giants with Lalian and Satureja in RM when we run into a bit of trouble.  Then out of the blue this blast saved us.  Asakura had decided to drop by and visit me after he had disappeared for weeks. He and I spend some time remembering the old times...  he took me to Erudin, his home town.  Sang me a sweet song.. then we went to SRo where I watched him slipping into eternal rest.  That was the saddest day of my EQ life.  Pika tried to cheer me up.. so he took me to CZ to meet up with Pinbin and Ebane.  Oh my.. Pinbin can pull a mean train... I think he still has a screenshot of 20+ dead lizzie bodies at our feet.  I remember being in AWE since he was 50+ and so was Ebane.  I had hoped I would become a Paladin like him one day... all in blue and full of fight. For a very very long time, and still to this day, Pinbin is the Paladin I look up to.  /salute + /hug Pinbin.<br>
<br>
Then I spend some time questing for my Ro Armors around 33rd.  Oh the fun I had running all over the world!!  I met so many people, saw so much thanks to that quest.  I will never regret spending 2 weeks doing various bits.  To this day I still never did the Ro Vambraces quest. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Kenya(diablo guildie) helped me with the MM granites, dying twice so we can hold the camp.  I remember dying trying to solo the undead cyclope, how I almost had him.. <br>
<br>
I remember dying in MM overand over for other people's RO armor. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That was fun despite the nasty deaths.  One time, while sitting in HK, a naked enchanter called Charmy dropped literally on top of me.  He gae me some buffs and disappeared.  I would end up pumping into him in LGuk with a cleric named Fyonna.  I spend an awful lot of 40's with them.  Incidently, that's how I meet Dewius. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    We were out in OoT when Dewius came along for a visit.  I remember seeing Dewius and go, whoa.. valor.. and 50+!! <br>
<br>
Then I meet Dewius again in Lguk when he was tanking for Charmy and Fyonna's group.  Dewius was the guy who showed me how to pull Lord. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Little did I know I would end up being his guildmate later in my EQ life. I ended up falling in love with LGuk and spend alot of my 40's and up to 51 there. I remember spending alot of time with Charmy and Fyonna in my 40's... I miss them still, it's just harder to get together since we are all so involved with our guilds.  I will alway remember Charmy's advice to me about breaking mez... &quot;taunt, stun, root then break the mez pls!&quot;<br>
<br>
I have met so many people during my time as Llorac.  I wish I can name them all, but I can only pick out random events that stick to my mind.  I remember Nitadyen(my favoritest Erudite cleric) always ressing me in Lguk. Bala, the sweetest dwarf alive who always had time to save my butt.  I remember meeting Laylow in my late 40's!!  He always had time to group with me and he was one of th best enchanter I know!  That silly elf know his stuffs!!  So many memorable people...  I even grouped with Parcelan before.. *yeep*.. but he sure was fun to get into fights with.<br>
<br>
Mysstie, my sweet sister.  I remember meeting you in HHK.  Remeber the time where I went LD in MM?  You had to evac out, but you came right back for me.  I was on the verge of dying, but you came back and evac us out.  I remember the misadventures we used to get in.  /hug Mysstie.  <br>
<br>
I remember that I can't make my way into Paws to turn in parts for my Soulfire.  Charmy and Pinbin came all the way from where they were and helped me get to the Brother.  I remember Stormriders helping me get my Soulfire part from Lucan.  I remember wishing I could join them.. Little did I know one day they will be part of my everyday EQ life.  /hug Elsinora.  You crazy monkey, hurry and lvl so we can have fun together again.<br>
<br>
I joined Council of Arcana for a while, they were always sweet and nice to me.  I regret having to leave the guild due to forces outside my control, but I do have to say they were always wonderful to me.  <br>
<br>
I was with Alliance of Arcane for a while too.  They were nice to me as well.  Bags and Gypsum always had time for me.  I left that guild because I did not with to stay in with someone I can't tolerate.  I will always remember the people in the guild fondly.  <br>
<br>
I went on my Fear raids when I was 50.  Oh dear... the deaths. :P  I walked out almost all blue by my 3rd raid, but I paid a heavy heavy price. The fact I was in all blue would lead to constant stream of arguements and fights with the person I cared for alot at that time. <br>
<br>
The time between 50 to 53 was a good period, but also awfully painful. In a way I was ashamed to talk about this time because I was silly enough to let myself get trapped in something I wasn't prepared for. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This is also something I can barely admit to people.. that I was really really stupid and naive. <br>
<br>
I used to be a fairly avid roleplayer. Unfortunately, that's why I got way too deep in this situation. I had tried to live up the my image of what a Paladin would play like.  Also, I don't like to play alone.  Between 35 to 53, I <br>
spend 95% of my online time with this one person. On one hand I was rarely alone, on the other hand alot of equipment problems came about when were in our late 40's.  Maybe I was the bitch for not letting him win all the drops or default things to him.. but I did not play this game so someone else can feel superior all the time at my expense... I just wanted to log in and have fun. On top of that, alot of lies and deceit were involved in that situation.. I don't want to recount details, I am just glad two people who are made miserable by each other are truly free now.  I rarely ever hate or truly despise anyone, but that person definitely made the top 10 list of people I would not pee on to save from fire.... to put it crudely..<br>
<br>
I would gladly raid and defer to those people I respect and like over and over again. The way Arclight and Dewius are make me just respect them so much. (I didn't type that about Arclight! Respecting Arclight? What drugs am I on?  /poke Arclight) So in short, defering to people I care about and respect isn't a problem, it's when I am told I have to or forced to.. that's when I will rebel.<br>
<br>
Around 53rd, I discovered I was all alone.  Alot of friends had quit, and I have alienated or lost touch with alot of my friends because I let one person get in the way.  I blamed myself for letting one person influenced my EQ life so much.  I have lost a lot of meaningful relationship I build in my youth.  During this time, without Mysstie, Dewius, Gurunt, Nilaen and Bloodson... I'd have left already.  <br>
<br>
This is how Kaerill came into existance.  So I can get away from it all and just be someone else.  This is also why she lvled to 40 super fast, yet did not start to lvl again until recently.  Due to my friends and my now <br>
guildmates, I fall back in love with Llorac again. Without SoTU, I would have left ages ago.  I have cared for and respect a ton of people in my EQ life, but Dewius is definitely the nicest, most honorable and most wacky guy ever.  Even though he and I never really talked at all during most of my life, he always had time to answer my silly Paladin questions.  He was also the person who started to get me involved in more events and fun things so I could start liking being Llorac again. Dewius=coolcat.  Talk to that cat, you'll see what I mean.  /hug Meowius.  <br>
<br>
I love my guild.  People are friendly, sweet, smart and compotent.  This group is the best I know in EQ.  They put friendship and fun above everything.  They welcomed me and take me under their wings.  Without them, EQ would be so dull.  Granted, things can be slow at times still, sometimes there are still frustration.  But true friends made EQ fun.<br>
<br>
Since coming back as Llorac, I made 6 lvls.  I know I am slow, but I will hit 60 one day.(only half way through 59th)  I finally feel like I found my little niche in EQ and I am with friends.  Granted I am a spoiled brat, selfish and all.. but I still try my best to be there for my friends.  <br>
<br>
I know I had forgotten to list alot of people, but I have met so many nice folks and most people I know treated me well.  *hugs all the sweet people*.<br>
<br>
Anyway, enough babbling and thanks for reading it this far. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Remember when we had both just joined CoA and sat on the docks at Queynos chatting?  That was lots of fun.  By the way, nice Warlance.  I hope that someday I'll be uber enough to group with you again.<br>

Geez.. more random memories floating up... I was in a nasty Fear raid where I died 13 times helping the raid tried to CR everyone's bodies..  Poor Nitadyen, he and this other cleric must have lost half a lvl or more.  <br>
<br>
I remember grouping with Brambodius in LGuk where that one time we all went LD due to server, but I came back all alone, he run back to save me when i was at purple health.  Baaguk who saved me from certain death in Lords at his expense... lucky GMs were ressing because it was server problem.  <br>
<br>
I even remembering Ishan telling me about CoM and how amazing CoM really is for lvl40~50.<br>
<br>
I definitely remember getting lost all over the place, espeically in Kurnak. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I still get lost, but at least I don't anymore for getting lost. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

bought eq on release, made erudite necro.  Couldnt see, got lost and well..  DELETE.<br>
<br>
Dark elf necro!  ok, they can see!  &lt;roamed neriak for 2 hours&gt; grr, i cant find the exit!  /shout how do i get out??  Then i get a tell, just attack the guard, so i did.  and im in nektulos!  yay!  (this was on xegony btw)  Made a few friends, got necro up to like 8.  <br>
<br>
New server comes out, i join that one..  Fresh new server, must be fun.  Nameless or tribunal, one of the two.  Got up a bit in levels..<br>
<br>
Another new server comes out.  Might have been quellious.  I join it.  Get necro up a few levels...<br>
<br>
Another new server comse out.  Might have been tribunal.  I dont quite remember all the servers and when they came out.  But i played a necro again of course, got RL friend into the game.  And he said lets go back to quellious!<br>
<br>
So, back at quellious.  He tells me, i want summoned crap, make a mage instead!.  I didn't really like it, but i did it.  <br>
<br>
Killed orcs,  killed dervs, oasis!!  Then i sat in highpass, and moved onto highkeep and soloed my way in highkeep from 20-30. <br>
<br>
Ohh, and then the fun farming of the halfling guards!  I got myself rich and got good exp too.  Then i moved onto guk and lived there till almost lvl 40ish.  <br>
<br>
Then kunark comes out.  Bein stupid and not realizing how bad exp DL is, i spent lvls like 43-49 there.  Getting 1 lvl a day if that.  horrible exp there..  Then i did other crap and managed to get mage up to 55.  <br>
<br>
Now i realize, wow, mage is boring, walk around and coth people.  this sux.   <br>
<br>
So i make a rogue on vazaelle.  Got him up to 32, hmm, i suck, im untwinked and weak as hell.  <br>
<br>
Sullon zek opens.  Play monk up to 20.  Wow, im getting my butt kicked by everything.  <br>
<br>
Back to quellious..  Wait 4 weeks for char transfer and get rogue from vazaelle on quellious..   Played rog up to 44 now..  Currently 2 yellow from 45.  Yay.

Ok. <br>
<br>
Started on Quellious January 2000. Really I guess anybody who didnt start in july/august of 99 is a newbie on Quell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I made an Erudite Wizard. Got lost in that horrible newbie area, and couldnt see a thing. Deleted. <br>
<br>
Made a nice simple Dorf Warrior. I even made his name Simple. <br>
<br>
&quot;Dook&quot; Who was later given a last name Diggler. <br>
<br>
Everything Dook learned, he learned from Tenon/Akon. About the basics of the game anyway. Around level 23 or so. Tenon introduced me to his guild, &quot;Nomad Souls&quot; That is where I met Denia, Kron, Lakars, Daranin, Glassder, Bruceleg, Azkirte, and many others. Skrabbit, Gurunt, and the original Stanly Manly were in that guild at one time. <br>
<br>
Around level 30. I met some of the most talented people on the server. Stormriders and Shadows of the Unseen.  I met Amoran, Eris's Twink Ulen, Kelina, Elderon's Twink Magis, Arjoth, and Palest, and Trianity, and Ethel of Glowing Embers/Immortal Vision. Also met Einmehr, a great bard. We were all level 30 or so in Cazic Together. I remember seeing Kelina and Ulen with their Yak's thinking &quot;Wow&quot;. Its funny because They were also the ones who taught me to make an assist key. I'm sure Amoran was happy about that. <br>
<br>
I went on to level him to 40. And then Quit the game, and deleted my char. And left the game for 8 months. <br>
<br>
When I came back this last November. I made Chikkin the bard. Immediately got in touch with the Nomad Souls again, and Amoran and Tenon. Also learned that many had quit the game, and now everything that was so uber prekunark. (I quit like 2 weeks after Kunark came out) was now yesterdays trash. <br>
<br>
I leveled Chikkin as fast as I could. Around level 20 I met one of my longer time friends Zenfe at the aviaks. I continued to level as fast as possible, and had Chikkin level 51 by January. Around level 51, groups seemed impossible, especially with my small guild, i couldnt get guildmates to group with me, they were never online or my level. I eventually left Nomad Souls. And talked to Amoran tons, I really was interested in Shadows of the Unseen. But I didnt really know anybody but Amroan, and I was still only level 51. <br>
<br>
Around this time. Ethel returned to the game from one of her many breaks. And caught up with her. She showed me her guild, what Glowing Embers had become, which was Immortal Vision. There I met Caiman, Xelar, Sauroken, Laer, Tez, Corae, Aleustria, and several others. Ethel took me to my first real &quot;raid&quot; on a Kael arena raid. I also met the cleric Sumer there. Who later became a good friend and guildmate. <br>
<br>
Few weeks later, I get a tell from Lenaleni. Turns out Descent needs bards for Trak. I tell her i'm only level 51, but she said she didnt care. And I was like &quot;wow, Trakanon, a dragon&quot; (before this, I had only been in seb maybe two times) That is when I met Tache, and pretty much the entire Descent crew. I found out later they were going to the plane of sky, and I got to go along. That is where I met Nida, Deamien, Faie, Tynan, Ruidian, Ninadar, who are still very dear friends of mine. Some of the best people on the server. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After 3 days in Sky, I later got an invite to Descent. I felt so wow'ed, so honored, to be in a uber guild. I proudly showed my tag off to everybody. Groups in Seb were easy to come by, just group with guildmates. I met so many people, and learned so much. Descent was a great learning experience. <br>
<br>
Around level 52, I ran into &quot;Havusin Mooz&quot; this cleric I had heard about being great and a veteran. I had even seen his posts on Quellious Quarters and thought &quot;what a great guy&quot; I ran into him in Guk. I think he was level 54 or level 55. He invited me to come sit in Am with, and be his mana battery. When I got there i was like &quot;Wow, You're Havusin&quot; and I'm sure he was amused. We talked for an hour about Wraith, Descent, Him quitting and leaving, Mok Nerfs, and Donal BP nerfs (this was around that time) Hav went on to become one of my closest friends in the game, and thanks to him, I met most everybody in the Wraith camp. <br>
<br>
<br>
Around level 56 I decided to leave Descent. Thanks to Hav, I got to go on 1 or 2 raids with Wraith, and meet a few more of them, they were and are some good people. I leveled on hardcore to 58, before running into Malla and Woow and Eevee and Spalter. Spalter and Malla told me alot about Vis Maior, and I was really impressed with how they presented themselves. Especially Spalter, I really feel lucky having spent many hours exp'ing with Spalter. Not to long after with Tache's encouraging, I found myself recruiting with Vis Maior. Where I went on a CT Raid (I had never seen the original CT) and did that fight with them, and was again Wow'ed. I remember telling Tache and Nida, and Deam, and anybody who would listen &quot;Wow, CT is -NOTHING- like killing Trakanon, the battle last SO LONG!&quot; <br>
<br>
I continued to raid with them, and never sleep and ding 60. Shortly after dinging 60, and after 6 weeks of recruiting, I got tagged with Vis.<br>
<br>
I wont sit here and write you paragrahps about how close the people in Vis Maior are, other than, thats my family on Quellious. Pure and simple, those are some amazing, talented, and wonderful people. <br>
<br>
<br>
Long read, but probably not as long as Lloracs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Btw Llorac since you started this thread, I still harass Rhad, Credit, Nana, and others. Finding out what Sotu is up to and what fun they're having.. some good people in your camp as well. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
