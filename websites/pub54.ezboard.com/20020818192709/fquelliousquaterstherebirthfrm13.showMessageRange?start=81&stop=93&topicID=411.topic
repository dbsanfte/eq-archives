<br>
First sucessfull Neg raid, with everyone going LD and too many people showing up, and the troll newbies. In the end it was just a mass of bodies that took down Neg by shear numbers.<br>
<br>
First sucessfull Planes raid, was the Plane of Hate, organized and executed mostly by Asternak, Ezeke, Andreas, Thkeron.<br>
<br>
First piece of planes armor on our server were cleric arms, which went to Thkeron, as he barely grabbed them as we were all getting completely wiped out, and then of course the quel quarters people exploded on him for that.<br>
<br>
First sucessfull Plane of Fear raid, was done by Shadows of the Unseen, the second and the following raids mostly by the same group that did the hate raid. In the end it is what caused the creation of the whole scheduling thing on Quellious Quarters as people started to fight over loot, and also because back then these zones were just simply too unstable to support 40-50+ people and often crashed.<br>
<br>
1st complete ass I have ran into in EQ, Jinmake of Dragons of Asia, 1st real dumb pair of guys I have ran into: Xanex and Bandayd of Slayers of Slaw.<br>
<br>
1st time I have had group members ditch me in a group while xp huntng: When Garil , Xanex and Bandaid went to chat and were geting Slayers of Slaw formed.<br>
<br>
The biggest of all aszholes I have ever met, that surpasses anyone even in real life as well as online by a mile, without any doubt whatsoever, is Occy/Ziggen. I regret it was Poper that croaked instead of him. Seriously. Even though he was actually naive enough to believe what Occy said at the time, I can attribute that to his age and it wouldnt matter in the longrun.<br>
<br>
1st legitimate Trakanon BP sold on our server: BY ME !  hehe. Yes I did it just to sorta say &quot;shove it&quot; and it was great.<br>
<br>
Beyond that I dont know because I stopped playing.<br>

<br>
AHHH! yes, wasn't happy about it at the time but I look back on it with a smile.  <br>
<br>
So I had never been in a guild EVER!, I was level 54 at the time, pottered about with Moonlight Crusaders(Goza, Treeweaver, Falconus, Alyse, Stitt AKA Boldair) and a few from Forsaken Avengers (Sweetypie's warrior, Koradan) then bumped into people from Lor Mani (Sicko, Thoras, Bricey monkey) ... but anyway I decided to join Forgotten Ways following prompting from Khaleid.  <br>
<br>
I believe they were allied with a guild called Sanctus Cogalium or something like that.  <br>
<br>
Hate had hardly been untouched at the time and I had hardly touched on leading raids and it was my first day so I agreed that I would go up with them.  <br>
<br>
I got to SRO quickly and it was around 4pm my time - so I thought great I have we have a real good shot at clearing the zone.  <br>
<br>
With me and my 50% crafted/50% indo and my mithril staff I thought damn! I am gonna cause some damage here.  I believe I was one of the higher level warriors on server then.  <br>
<br>
So I saw a bunch of people waiting to port up, so I went and sat with them and said hi have your got room for me, so I can port up with you ?.  <br>
<br>
No reply<br>
<br>
So I asked again...<br>
<br>
No reply<br>
<br>
Suddenly both groups disappear, just leaving me there.  Fair enough I thought,  I'll give it a while, they will come down and get me.<br>
<br>
One hour passed and obviously getting a little figgity, I try and find out what's going on.  <br>
<br>
Eventually (about an hour after I start enquiring) a wizard comes down and ports me &quot;About time&quot; I say and he got all funny with me.  Balls to him, I thought I have been sat here for a couple of hours waiting.  <br>
<br>
So finally I get a port up and start running to SWC camp and promptly die on route to camp.  <br>
<br>
I consent all the rogues up there and sit waiting.  Another hour passes, so I again make enquiries.  <br>
<br>
&quot;We need to clear to portal to get your corpse&quot; was my reply.  <br>
<br>
Now looking back on it WTF???? LOL wouldnt buy this one anymore but I did at the time - you didnt/dont even pull near portal until ya get to throne room (well I dont anyway). <br>
<br>
So I wait another hour without success, then I spend the time organising a group together to go help me port up, so I could loot my corpse and we could gate out. <br>
<br>
This takes another hour to sort. <br>
<br>
So I loot my corpse and our wizard gets nailed as I finish looting then we all die apart from a couple who gated.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Then I send a tell up to those in the Planes saying what has happened.  By this time, sure I was getting a little peeved to say this least.  <br>
<br>
EVENTUALLY, with around 15 mins to go on my rez timer, I get a pop up window - a torrent of abuse and a /guildremove.  <br>
<br>
Definitely my shortest lived guild (have only been in 4)<br>
<br>
All in all time spent getting to PoH = around 8 hours, time hunting there 1 hour. <br>
<br>
I went to bed slightly disgruntled.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usadrespinegnawer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sadre Spinegnawer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/31/02 12:14:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=411.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quellious - Server and Msg Board History....</span><hr size=1> Before trak had been killed on the server, and pretty much everyone was like completely blown away whenever they would first hear what her AE was (how much!!!! gah!!  that's unkillable!!), and also during a time of relative harmony and tranquility, I remember being asked to come on an exploratory raid with a bunch of vm and wraith people down into lower sebilis.  I was blown away by the jugg arena -- what a chaotic rush!<br>
<br>
So we made it to right before the bridge leading up to trak's lair.  We were all just sitting around and saying wow, this is a scary place.  I think the gm &quot;Felix the Person&quot; was there to see what we were gonna be crazy enough to try to do.  Thing is, we weren't gonna try anything, it was just a dry run to the lair.<br>
<br>
Then someone aggrod trak.  I was sitting facing the lair, and I saw the big ugly head snap around the corner.  Yikes!  Just enough time for a screenie, then dead.  Felix, equipped with his ever trusty fishing pole, summoned our corpses back to zone and rezzed us.<br>
<br>
That was a fun night.  EQ is best when people are experiencing the thrill of adventure and being just a little bit scared to death together.  Too many names!  But cheers to all the old and new friends on Quellious who I've had the luck to journey with to strange places and kill things dead!<br>
<br>
And, let me tell you, to this day, I am kicking myself for not shouting &quot;Casters and Clerics!!  Go Go Go!&quot;  hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
