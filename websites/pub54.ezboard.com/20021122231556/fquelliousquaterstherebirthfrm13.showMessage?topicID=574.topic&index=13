<br>
&quot;you people disgust me, your actually getting HAPPYNESS from hearing someone lost 400 dollars?&quot;<br>
<br>
I didnt post it because its just anybody, I posted it because it was Mlain. And it wast just about him buying some account, and getting ripped off, it was about his reputation being so bad that he had to resort to spending $400 on finishing his epic, since no guild would do it for him. <br>
<br>
<br>
I dont see a good snipet to quote you on your comment about one's previous deeds. But let me say this. <br>
<br>
This is why it is so important in Everquest to many who are veterans. When people come to the game, some think they can say and do whatever they want without consequence. When they finally get to a point where they need something in Everquest since just about everything in the game requries having friends to help you, they quickly realize that having a bad reputation is actually the worst thing they could ever create for themselves. They tend to be quickly sorry for their actions, seen the light, will do better, is a new person, overnight learned from their mistakes, and is on best behavior. WhatEVER it takes to get them what they want. <br>
<br>
When people buy into this &quot;I'm so sorry&quot; crap, they basically are telling that person that everything they ever did they did indeed get away with, that it is all ok now, with a simple apology of a few keystrokes. In addition to this, everquest players cannot see a person's expression, hear their tone of voice, their body language, or the general vibes they're giving. For all one knows, when say a Casey Croft comes here to say he's sorry, he's doing it while he's Rolling his eyes, laughing, and plotting his next move. Since all we EQ'ers have to go by is actions -- not words. (Especially once integrity is in question) we aren't very forgiving. That is why when Moho comes to post he's a new guy, I think the last thing I said was something along the llines of lets see where all the dust settles a month or 2 from now. <br>
<br>
<br>
So! When Mlain pulled the crap he did in the past, like letting a person die because of his crappy heals (when someone dies in my group and I'm on my Cleric, I feel like the scum of the earth when it's downright my fault) and then after the person dies, says he'll res them, and then without informing the victim, takes an item of his armor, and tells the player &quot;this is your payment for me res'ing you&quot; -- thats pretty much stealing. Back in days when /consent let someone loot your corpse of all droppables, Verant would not replace items. This was such a problem, because of people like Mlain, which is why /consent is how it is today, where they only drag corpses. <br>
<br>
Stealing~Karma<br>
<br>
<br>
As for him trying to buy the account for the King's note. Did you see the big thread about Ragefire? Mlain LIED (Lying is not ok irl, and its not ok in EQ either) to get on that ragefire list, and get his &quot;last piece of epic&quot; then when he applied at like every guild on the server trying to find a guild to simply use (you think he was looking to make friends, or just become an all-around better player and see the sights in eq?) into getting him his Chardok piece, I dont recall who, or how many, look it up on the thread if you want, but several people stated they would never help him, and several guilds shunned him. <br>
<br>
He decided he was going to cheat, break the eula, and break the system of eq (system = reputation) and buy his way out of his mess, that TOO came back to bite him in the butt. <br>
<br>
<br>
This is not a flame at you at all, I have nothing against you, nor do I even know you. I'm merely explaining why we &quot;fucking sick, cold heartless peices of shit.&quot; feel the way we do. <br>
<br>
<br>
I just now looked over the last 2 paragraphs of your post. Only other thing I have to add, is you mix prejudice, discrimination, and &quot;grudges&quot; interchangably. However there is a difference in all 3. <br>
<br>
We are not prejudging someone, or making judgements about someone who we havent even met (in this case, met means Everquest) <br>
We are not discriminating someone because of their race, ethnic background, age, sex, etc. In fact he, like everybody else starts off on the same clean slate we all did. <br>
<br>
<br>
And you're right. Its never ok to steal from someone. Never. I'm pretty sure, knowing Hav, that he wasn't saying it's ok to be robbed. But everybody knows when you buy from Playerauctions or Ebay, you never know if you will get what you pay for. Mlain knew the money was a risk, and obviously if he was going to spend $400 on something &quot;risky&quot; and for EQ (not like it was his Rent money or Car Payment) that it wasnt vital for his day to day needs and survival. He was merely explaining that nobody here was celebrating Mlain's last breath of air, or again anything &quot;vital&quot;.<br>
<br>
For an analogy, if Mlain sign's up for a Math class, knows the &quot;system&quot; is to study for homework, and never does, thinking he'll get away with it, while others do things right and study. Then tries to pay someone cash to let them copy off them so he can get that A on the test, and then be screwed by the kid he paid money to, and was given the wrong answers. Then we were amused because he got an F, although previously at the beginning of the schoolyear laughed at all of us for studying, would it be wrong to be glad to see what goes around, comes around?<br>
<br>
<br>
Lauriston, <br>
<br>
Not sure why you mentioned his skill at playing a ranger, unless just paying him a compliment, if so then great, if not, then I know you realize that someone's skill has nothing to do with their personality and morals. <br>
<br>
As for your comment on growing up. <br>
<br>
Havusin's last name, like mine (Chikkin Chunks) or Ravenark's (F'Tattle) or anybody else with a &quot;silly&quot; last name is made with good intentions. Simply to make others laugh, and you never can get enough laughter and fun out of life. If even one person saw Hav's last name and laughed irl at first sight, that would have made both their and Hav's day. So &quot;growing up&quot; doesnt apply in that case. He wasnt showing immaturity. <br>
<br>
Nitch/Nerve, <br>
<br>
As for Quellious history stuff. I simply had way too much free time on my hands back in those days. Hav will tell you :P I never know anything anymore. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Btw Act, I know better than to never say never, however, I would like to think that on Everquest and EQ msg boards, I have &quot;never&quot; said or done anything to anybody I wouldn't say or do to their face. If it makes you feel any better, if I knew Mlain irl, and he came over to my house and told me what happen, I would shake my head, let out a slight chuckle, and probably say something to him along the lines of  &quot;That sucks man, but you know you had it coming to you, no sympathy here guy... Wanna play Tekken?&quot;<br>

<br>
Laur complimented me because he's a nice guy, he'll do that, he's a good heart and a good head on his shoulders and can perceive any situation given, and always come out on the good end of it, that's just who he is, and many (subconciously , perhaps) wonder why =P (thanks laur i havent seen a compliment since uhh .. .. ... yeah)<br>
<br>
On your breaking of the EULA - I snap the rules like a twig. I share my account with RL friends, others share their accounts with me, I run EQW (sometimes I have a cleric, my ranger, and my friend's rogue and go kill stuff out of boredom alone) open multiple times ... I sware on eq , i make sexual references on EQ, the EULA means *VERY* little to me - I carry my life rules with me onto a game that I carry IRL. <br>
<br>
And I dont buy into the &quot;I'm so sorry&quot; crap , I do however have the capacity and ability to forgive , forget, and let someone try again. In that extent, I can be a very kind person, to the point that it can, occasionaly be a weakness.<br>
<br>
and chris, when im playing my cleric, I lag all the time so sometimes ch dont land fast enough .. whoops, oh well. <br>
<br>
People like the infamous Mr. Croft are unbeleivable because of who they are , and due to the fact I have had conversations with Mr. Croft outside and on Everquest, he is one of the few people I could soon forgive.<br>
<br>
And your story is wrong, Mlain looted an item from the person on an assurance he would pay XXXX - have you ever had someone offer to pay you 100pp to go rez them in some far off shithole, then have them take off? it isnt flameboard whiner worthy, it's norez list worthy tho - and if my knowledge of EQ 3 years ago back on original acturian is correct ... you saw that kind of thing more and more often, due to the fact transportant was a wee bit more difficult, and a longer trip.<br>
<br>
and to your final statement , I can also say the same, in three years. There are honestly a few people I would like to meet face to face to get the opportunaty to tell them things.<br>
<br>
And yes, Lauriston is right, I am a fair bit younger then a good portion of you think. I have my &quot;childish&quot; moments, but everyone does. I just enjoy mine more because I can get away with them for another year <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p>~Baron Acturian Rarr~<br>

The point of my post was to comment on your OWN self appointed weakness and enjoy your optimism while you can.  However, since you are a Fuckstick.....<br>
<br>
You have truly earned the name of Sir Fuckstick.<br>

I gave him not one but TWO opportunities to NOT be a fecking clown and he blew them TWICE.  That's not being a asshole about it, that's being considerate.  <br>
<br>
Two people have made my WHOLE ignore list in 2 years, he's one of them...I'll speak to anyone and everyone, I really dont mind.  If I dont like em, they wont make my ignore list, but Mlain is just a Grade A Tool. <br>
<br>
Acturian, if you don't see it - that's fine power to ya.  <br>
<br>
I DO find it funny that he splashed out $400 on a cleric, not the fact that it has deprived him of some cash, its the fact that he is such a clusterf*ck to actually spend this dosh on something like this.  <br>
<br>
Since when did a 53 cleric cost $400 anyway.  <br>
<br>
Anyone wanna buy a 60 warrior? with 57 cleric and 52 monk on the same account...<br>

Taking bids on $5000....Mlain want it ?  <br>

Nice post-totally agree.<br>
<br>
One point.<br>
Please clarify.<br>
<br>
I know nothing about JAG, but I gather you rotate appointment as prosecutor or defense counsel.<br>
<br>
At least I hope so, otherwise I no think I want you defending me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
All that being said, I put a lot of people in jail, then I became a prosecutor...  Most times a defense counsel's job is damage control.  Confession may be good for the soul, but bad for your defense.<br>

I think it is kinda mean to laugh that be lost the $400, but... in all honesty, if he was planning to drop it on EQ, it was throwaway money anyway. It's like losing 400 bucks in the slots - it's not nice to laugh that they lost it, but you can't really feel sorry for them. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC=http://home.earthlink.net/~cromin/_uimages/Raalf.gif><BR>

He didn't LOSE $400....  it wasn't stolen from him.<br>
<br>
The guy made such an ass of himself he CHOSE to spend $400 to get that MQ peice because he felt it would be easier than repairing his reputation or finding people capable and willing to help him.<br>
<br>
If someone had hacked or stolen (real life money type stolen) from Mlain, that's a different issue.    <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>
