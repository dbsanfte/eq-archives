What about the rights of those 3000+ of my fellow Americans who died not even knowing what was going on?  What about the rights of all those children whose mommies and daddies were killed mercilessly for merely going to work to bring home the bacon for them to eat?  What about the rights of all those parents who lost their children that day?  What about the rights all those innocent firefighters, police officers, and EMT whose main goal was to dive into that death trap in attempts to save a few lives but ended up losing their own?<br>
<br>
Don't give me that &quot;fight for their rights&quot; crap when there are 3000+ of my own innocent countrymen are dead.  When there are thousands of husband and wives who will now go to bed alone because some jackass killed their loved ones.  When there are thousands of children who will no longer have a mom or dad to run to and give hugs to when they get home from school.<br>
<br>
If the Afghan people are so innocent in this mess, why didn't they protest again harboring a terrorist mastermind?  Why do they beat their own women into submission for showing a mere finger in public?  There were reports of a 70 year old elderly Afghan woman who was beaten because she had a stray hair poking out of her birka.  Why should we support a culture like that?  What we're doing over there, eliminating the Taliban, actually benefits the Afghan people.  Women are now significantly freer than they were 4 months ago.  They are even free to hold office.  I know who my enemies are, and they're the people who knowingly harbored the man who masterminded the death of over 3000 of my people.  If they're so willing to die for their cause, why weren't they willing to die protesting what they felt was right, unless of course, they felt that what bin Laden was doing is right.<br>
<br>
For anyone against our war against terrorism and bin Laden, remember, he started it when he used 4 of our own commercial jets as missiles to kill innocent civilians.  If you came across an attacker on the street who proceeded to beat you with a baseball club, attempting to break your bones, would you just stand there and take it, or would you attempt to retaliate?  It's not like Sept 11 was the first time bin Laden and his goons made an attack on us.  We've been passive long enough.  Should we as Americans continue to sit here and watch them wipe us off the map?  Do you anti-war hippies actually think there is talking to this man?  Don't you think we've tried?  How many more Americans must die?<br>
<br>
Think of the attack on the USS Cole off the coast of Yemen. Think of the attack on the US Embassies abroad. Think of the first World Trade Center attack. By eliminating the Taliban and the terrorist network, we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> preventing further losses of lives. And it's not just Americans that bin Laden and his goons are after. Keep that in mind.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/urehmy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rehmy</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/bloomingflower.gif" BORDER=0> at: 1/22/02 7:39:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucyllyan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyllyan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Duracyl the mana battery</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/22/02 9:51:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This really steams my clams (off EQ-topic)</span><hr size=1> <br>
Before the Taliban took power in, what was it, like 1992 or something? Not sure. Anyways before then, Afghan women wore nail polish, had careers, went to school. In fact, they did a heck of a lot of the same things we American women take for granted. It was only when the Taliban seized control of the country several years ago that the head to toe burqahs were adopted, and the beating for the things Rehmy listed above started. Most Afghans fear and hate the Taliban.<br>
<br>
Much the same as Germany during  WWII, the population there is being controlled by a small minority of radicals, who rule by terror. Should the Afghan people be blamed for not fighting back? Should we blame the German people for the Holocaust? I can't even comprehend how difficult it would be to be the first person to stand up to a Nazi or a Taliban extremist. I can honestly say I don't know if I myself would have the strength and courage to do so.<br>
<br>
I don't know if there was a point to this post or not. Only that it's important to remember who the true enemy is here...Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban. Not the Afghan people as a whole.<br>

<br>
Thanks for the rhetoric. Those Afghan citizens being watched over by HR groups are not the people that are responsible for the deaths during the attack. Instead of shooting your mouth off with rhetoric, read the arguments being put forth.<br>
<br>
&gt;What about the rights of all those children whose mommies &gt;and daddies were killed mercilessly for merely going to work &gt;to bring home the bacon for them to eat? What about the &gt;rights of all those parents who lost their children that day? &gt;What about the rights all those innocent firefighters, police &gt;officers, and EMT whose main goal was to dive into that &gt;death trap in attempts to save a few lives but ended up &gt;losing their own?<br>
<br>
What does abusing the Afghani people do to rectify this problem. Of course, it is a horrible situation, but the point is that that HR groups around the world are (and should be) concerned with violations of rights being taken by the US military towards the Afghani people. I would hate for Afghanistan, a country in dire straits before we arrived and will be for some time after, to have to lose 3000 of their countrymen because you decide it is alright to violate their rights.<br>
<br>
&gt;Why should we support a culture like that? What we're doing &gt;over there, eliminating the Taliban, actually benefits the &gt;Afghan people. Women are now significantly freer than they &gt;were 4 months ago. They are even free to hold office. I &gt;know who my enemies are, and they're the people who &gt;knowingly harbored the man who masterminded the death of &gt;over 3000 of my people. If they're so willing to die for their &gt;cause, why weren't they willing to die protesting what they &gt;felt was right, unless of course, they felt that what bin &gt;Laden was doing is right.<br>
<br>
Your not understanding the difference between the government and the people. Our government has continually done unjust things that the people of the US haven't been in the streets willing to die for. You have to grip the concept of the people and the state. The state (Taliban) is responsible for policy. The people in their form of government are responsible for supporting the government. Nothing more, they have no imput. Resistance would be futile, much like American's never protested the sterilizing of Jews or the death camps for Japanese Americans during WW2. Your arguing two seperate things which don't work together.<br>
<br>
&gt;If they're so willing to die for their cause, why weren't they &gt;willing to die protesting what they felt was right, unless of &gt;course, they felt that what bin Laden was doing is right.<br>
<br>
As I said in my previous post, look in a global facts book or an encylopedia. The people (again your being confused) likely had no idea that Bin Laden was doing anything. I would even go so far as to say that the Taliban govt. had no idea what was going on. In terrorists acts, the fewer the people that know the more chance of success that you have. Once again, the government is being punished by the US for their involvement in the past with Bin Laden. There is no reason whatsoever to punish the people. That is what these HR groups are protesting.<br>
<br>
I'll leave it there as this is getting very long. Please read arguments and respond thoughtfully. Rhetoric just doesn't cut it.<br>
