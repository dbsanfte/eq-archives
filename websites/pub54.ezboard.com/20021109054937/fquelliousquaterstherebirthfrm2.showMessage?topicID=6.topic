Characters mentioned all actually exist in the game with the exception of Valmoran (my own invention, never actually played in the game, and he's dead now anyway, Merteuil just writes to him in the way she might write in a journal), Jodelle (Ahkaya's mother, dead before the events in this series took place), and the aged elf who only appears in the prologue to the series.

Mekora V`Toria, Private Journal</span><hr size=1> It is done, I have told Mlain everything.  I know not whether I would have chosen tonight for this confession but Zenogias's actions today left me no choice: I fear not only what he has done to me but also what I have become.<br>
<br>
I had sought refuge in Highpass, where I had hoped I might work on my brewing in peace, but it was not to be....  Zenogias insisted upon seeing me, he claimed he had something for me, and I reluctantly agreed to meet him.  But when he found me... he threw me to the ground and slashed my wrist, then slashed his own and held our wounds together fast so that our blood might flow into one another....  I could only look on in horror, powerless to stop him yet fearing the outcome of this act which he claims has united us forever.<br>
<br>
When it was done, he left me, and disappeared.<br>
<br>
I knew I must tell Mlain what had happened, and I did, I told him everything: I confessed how I had loved him and had never wanted anyone to know, how I had grown to care about Zenogias believing that Mlain could never return my feelings for him and how Zenogias now would not let me go, and I told him what Zenogias had done to me, there, in Highpass.<br>
<br>
I suppose it was then that Mlain decided Zenogias must die.  He asked me to send a message to Zenogias, to arrange for him to go to the Arena where Mlain could kill him once and for all, and I did.... I told Zenogias that I had to see him again, to be with him, where it all began, in the arena in Neriak.  I feared Zenogias would easily see through my feeble attempt at deception, as I am not used to such ways, but I hoped his desire to be with me would prevail over any suspicions he might have.<br>
<br>
He came to the arena but knew immediately that Mlain was waiting for him....  In desperation I tried to claim that I had brought Mlain there so that Zenogias could kill him as he had once sworn to do, but it was useless.  They began to do battle but did not fight to the death, Zenogias claiming that since Mlain had not fought him when he had wanted to, he would now have to wait until Zenogias was ready to fight him.  I could only look on in horror.<br>
<br>
When Mlain had gone I could stand it no longer, I lashed out at Zenogias in rage and pain, telling him how I had tried to deceive him, to lure him to his death, that he had lost.  I fled to the temple but he followed me even there, despite my cruel words I still could not drive him away.  We spoke for hours as we used to do, and I hope now he understands, about me, and Mlain, and that Zenogias and I can never be together the way he would want.<br>
<br>
I await Mlain's return and hope that he has not come to doubt me as well....<br>

Perhaps I have misjudged you, perhaps not; it does not matter anymore.  You are not a threat to me, I do not fear you; fear is for the weak, and though I have faced my share of weaknesses, you will find me greatly changed.<br>
<br>
Because you see, Merteuil... my prayers have finally been answered.  I have prayed to our Lord to fill my heart with hatred, to expel those sentiments unworthy of me, to root out all weakness... and it has finally come to pass.  In that moment, when Mlain and I were wed... that moment, when Mlain said &quot;Mekora, I hate you&quot; and I looked into his eyes and saw the depth and the purity of Innoruuk's hatred, something within me changed.  His is the example I must follow, which will lead me ever closer to serving our Father's will.<br>
<br>
I am dead inside, Merteuil, dead save for the fires of hate which burn within my heart.  No longer am I tormented by feelings which have no place in the heart of a true child of Innoruuk.  I feel nothing for Zenogias, for Daladdar, not even for you.  Mlain and I are one now and any who dare oppose us will fall before our might.<br>
<br>
As for Aeeny, she will die as will all paladins, but I have not singled her out.  Zenogias may do with her as he pleases, it is no concern of mine.  If he chooses her over his own people, then he will die as a traitor to our race, it is that simple.  Stykos will die as well; he seems to believe that we have achieved some sort of friendship, just because I did not fight him when I had the chance, but he will see in the end that he was wrong.<br>

Our reign of darkness has only just begun.<br>

So that is how it happened, my dear unholy Shadow Knight.  I was informed only of the scars which were present on Zenogias's wrists.  I am sure you will known when that ocurred, since it now appears he is not yet released in all aspects from you.  It appears that even you havn't dealt with Zenogiaas or even Id yet!

Mekora,<br>
<br>
As much as ye may have thyself fooled, I am not purchasing the wares you're attempting to peddle. Ye seem far too intelligent a being to merely follow something that thou hast been told, nor do you seem that weak willed. <br>
<br>
If thy hatred is so recharged, and thy disgust for paladins has indeed been rekindled, why it it then that you converse with me still? Would not the most prudent outlet be to hunt me down and attack me when I am not prepared? A different idea would be to challenge me to a duel and meet me at an Arena...if ye felt like ye were losing ye could have friends onhand to jump in and slay me. I know what ye will say, thou wilt tell me that a duel is an honorable thing which should be handled as such...however I could not even possibly think that honor is anywhere in &quot;the father's&quot; plans. After all, I'm just a human, right? I'm just a paladin, right? &quot;Show that dog no honor, Mekora! Slay him where he stands and be done with it!&quot;<br>
<br>
I confess I am losing respect for you. At least the truely evil are unwaivering in their conviction. It is misdirected, but it is honorable to see that kind of commitment. Personally I am surprised ye have found the commitment to be wed, which is another thought I have had.<br>
<br>
Love. Now, that doth NOT seem like a concept that is covered in &quot;the father's&quot; all knowing whatever. Love is a weakness, right? Thou hast to rely on another being to give you that which you can not give to thyself, and as you have told me before, needing someone is a weakness.<br>
<br>
Mekora, ye need to take a lot of time and do some true soul searching to find out if thou art proceeding the way ye feel ye should. ‘tis clear to me thou art confused and misguided. I am not about to attempt to convert ye, I am not about to preach to ye, I will merely give ye one thought to ponder before I continue about my way:<br>
<br>
Choose ye a path, and stay vigilant. Thy continuous waivering is not doing ye any good, nor do I think is it pleasing any god.<br>
<br>
Personally, every beast I slay, it hurts just a little bit more...I however, do not allow my personal feelings to interfere with the path that I have chosen. Would that I could find a different way to carry on the will of Rodcet Nife, however until that time I shall do so in the best way that I am capable. I do not believe that killing can lead to peace, but until I find a better way, killing is what I must do. <br>
<br>
That is called conviction, Mekora. I suggest you try to find some.<br>

<br>
You misunderstand me, you insult me, and if you make the mistake of underestimating me, I assure you it will be your last.<br>
<br>
I am not merely following what I have been told, I am following what I believe, what I have always believed.  The path of hatred I have chosen of my own free will, when I first became a dark knight of Innoruuk.  And if at times I have strayed from that path, I assure you, those days are over.<br>
<br>
Love?  Why, who said anything about love?  Perhaps for you, marriage implies love, but you should know that is not the case among my people.  Aye, love is a weakness, and ‘tis one which I have finally found the strength to expel from my heart.  My commitment to Mlain is not a weakness, any more than my loyalty to Innoruuk; rather, I draw strength from both.  And you are quite right that needing someone is a weakness as well.  You have been paying attention, I see, or are these lessons you have learned on your own?<br>
<br>
And as for why I continue to converse with you... perhaps it is one last attempt to sow the seeds of hatred within your heart.  I shall not hunt you down, for your life is of no more or less value to me than any other I shall take.  Our battle will take place when the time is right, and I shall enlist the help of no others when the time comes... though not for the reasons you may think.  It is not about honor; rather, I wish to slay you myself, unaided... I need to look into your eyes, at the moment when you are about to die, when you realize that I am about to take your life and that even your god cannot save you now... just before I strike the final blow I need to see that you understand that hatred has triumphed once again.<br>
<br>
And who knows?  I may even see hatred reflected in your eyes as well.<br>

Merteuil Bellemort to Mekora Dreamthief</span><hr size=1> Bravo, Mekora!  I must admit I had my doubts, but no longer; if Mlain has brought about this change in you, then I fully approve of your union.  We are on the same side, after all; I hope you realize that and no longer regard me as your enemy.  I sent you the information about Aeeny precisely because I thought it might assist you in ridding the world of yet another paladin; use it as you wish or do not use it at all, it makes no difference to me.<br>
<br>
Do you know, Ahkaya has been asking me of late how she might go about earning the trust and respect of your people....  I take this as a hopeful sign though I doubt it will ever be possible for one such as her to be tolerated within the walls of your dark city, or even within your forest.  Nonetheless, I applaud her desire to get to know your people better; perhaps you could assist her in her endeavors.<br>

Ahkaya, private journal</span><hr size=1> I must come out of hiding soon, I want very much to see Zenogias again... but first I want to do something, to prove myself I suppose.  I want to gain the trust of Zenogias's people, I want to be welcomed by the dark elves, or at least tolerated....  I want to be able to freely enter Neriak without fearing for my life, I want to see this city which is his home.  I have asked Merteuil how I might go about earning the trust of the Teir`Dal, but she says it would never be possible for one such as myself to be accepted within the walls of Neriak.  But I will not be so easily deterred.<br>
<br>
I have sought Mekora's assistance in this matter, though I am reluctant to confide in her and I know she has little patience for me.  Of course I did not tell her my true reasons!  She assures me that I may camouflage myself to enter the city, and that if I go to the library in the Third Gate and bring some red wine to the scribe of Innoruuk, I shall gain the favor of guards and merchants alike.<br>
<br>
I shall set about this task at once, and show Merteuil that even a half elf like me can enter the forests of Nektulos.  I believe she will be pleased, and I hope Zenogias will be pleased as well.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umekora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mekora</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(3/31/01 3:26:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> XLIX.  Mekora Dreamthief to Merteuil Bellemort</span><hr size=1> Merteuil,<br>
<br>
Today I celebrate my greatest victory -- not over any beast or foe, but over what was once an awful weakness within myself.<br>
<br>
We had gone to Velious, to the Tower of Frozen Shadow, Mlain , Zenogias, and I.  Mlain had been spending much time there as of late, and I was most interested to see this place which had practically become his home.  With the assistance of some other adventurers we picked up along the way, we quickly made our way to the fifth floor and kept the area clean of the undead spirits which haunt the place still.<br>
<br>
After some time we grew bored with our prey and decided to venture higher, though not one of us had seen the sixth floor before that night.  Mlain went off to fetch us our next victim, but it was not to be....  Merteuil, if I could have given my life for Mlain I would have, but there was nothing I could do to save my husband from the foul beast who appeared just at that moment.  Our entire party was defeated save Zenogias and myself, as we had managed to convince the beasts of our demise.  I could not help but think that perhaps if I had been able to impart some of my life to Mlain he might not have fallen that day, but Zenogias assured me there was nothing I could have done to save him.<br>
<br>
When it was safe to get up, we knew we must run quickly for the exit.  Zenogias took my hand and kissed my cheek, and together we cloaked ourselves so that the undead spirits could not see us.  We ran into the room of spectres which led to the teleporter... but somehow, the spectres saw through our cloak, and set upon us.  There was no time to think, only to act!  I ran down the first corridor I saw, not knowing whether it was the right path or not, found the teleporter and passed through... only to fall to the shadow guardians outside.<br>
<br>
Only later did I realize the victory in my defeat, for in the moment when Zenogias and I were facing death, when I ran for the exit I did not turn back.  I suppose I believed that Zenogias was still with me at the time, but I did not look back to find out, I did not look back as I had done in North Freeport that day that we were killing paladins, when I could not leave him there to die.  As I later learned, Zenogias had not followed me to the exit, he had fallen to the spectres within.<br>
<br>
I felt no guilt nor remorse.  I felt nothing.  Not when he kissed me, not when I lost him, not when I realized what had happened, save an incredible sense of triumph over my own weakness where he was concerned.  Merteuil, you are quite right, and I believe my torment is finally over.<br>
<br>
As for Ahkaya, I have spoken with her, and I am sure you will see her in Neriak sometime soon.<br>

Stykos Percussio to Mekora Dreamthief</span><hr size=1> Ye say that I misunderstand ye. Is that the case or is it that ye misunderstand thyself?<br>
<br>
I never underestimate an opponent, though I do not consider ye an opponent. If ye wish to fight me, so be it, for I can not change thy mind, however let me make one thing perfectly clear: I do not hate, and I do not fear. It seems to me thou art taking the coward's road. &quot;When the time is right&quot;, ye say. &quot;when the time comes&quot;, ye say. &quot;Your life is of no more or less value to me than any other I shall take.&quot; More contradictions. If my life is worth nothing to ye, why expend energy to take it? If my life IS worth ending, why wait? Ye say I underestimate ye...nay, I think thou art underestimating thyself. Ye say it is not about honor, it is about ye wishing to look into my eyes when I expire to see what I realize...my lady, thou wilt be SORELY disappointed when ye see my eyes. If it is the will of Rodcet Nife that I am to be slain, ye shall see in my eyes not fear, not anger, and ye will not see me realizing that hatred has triumphed. What ye will see is peace. Thou wilt see that it is not that my god can not save me...nay, 'tis in fact just the reverse. My god WILL save me. Life or death means naught. My eyes will reflect only peace, understanding and forgiveness.<br>
<br>
Aye, forgiveness...for while it seems that thou hast no tolerance or acceptance for what I am, I forgive ye for thy wishes, Mekora. I forgive ye for wishing me harm, I forgive ye for thy attempts to cause me to hate, and I forgive ye now if ye shall slay me.<br>
<br>
As far as thy marriage, I have seen ye speak of him, and while I doth not know much of hate, I do know of love. Are ye so skilled in the arts of evil that thou art able to successfully lie to thyself as well? Food for thought, methinks.<br>
<br>
I hope this message finds ye in good spirits, and though it is to battle, I hope we are to meet again soon. A paladin has few friends, and though it may be a sin I consider ye one of mine. I hath not figured out if it be stranger that thou doth want to kill me or that I doth seek friendship with ye.<br>
<br>
Stay safe, Mekora<br>
<br>
Stykos<br>
