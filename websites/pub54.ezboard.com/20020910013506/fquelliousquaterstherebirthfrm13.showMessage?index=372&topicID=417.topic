Not every class is supposed to be able to do everything!  Rangers cant feign death, monks cant port, wizards cant tank.  <br>
<br>
Differant classes excel in differant situations.  Some classes are better for raids while others are better at soloing.  Some classes start out powerful and become weaker at higher levels.  Some start out weak and become very powerful.  Wizards just happen to be the class that starts the weakest and ends up the most powerful (damagewise at least).<br>
<br>
Everyone here is bitching about how they dont have some uber AA ability or class skill.  Guess what, not every class is supposed to have an uber AA ability or class skill!  <br>
<br>
I'll use druids as an example.  I hear druids bitching all the time about how they aren't able to contribute as much as other classes on high end large raid content.  Druids whine that they need better heals and better nukes because they are so much weaker than clerics and wizards!  Well guess what, if druids could heal as well as clerics AND nuke as well as wizards, why the hell would anyone ever play a cleric or wizard?  Druids are not a &quot;raiding&quot; class.  Hate to burst your bubble =(.  Druids are a class that is best suited towards single player ability and smaller sized encounters.  Jack of all trades, master of none.  They have the ability to do well in any situation, whereas other classes only excel in certain environments (paladins vs undead mobs and rogues in places they can backstab).<br>
<br>
Dont get your panties in a bundle, wizards whine a lot too.  Take a look at the wizard forums over at graffe.com.  I garuntee you that at any given time you'll find some wizard whining because they &quot;suck in exp groups&quot;, how &quot;low level wizards cant do jack&quot; and how they &quot;need clarity 3 just to keep up with a paladins DPS&quot;.  Guess what wizzies, for most of your existance, you're not as good at standard exp situations as other classes are!  Wizards start out the weakest, but as their reward for their perserverence, end up the most powerful (in terms of damage and versitility in end game encounters).  As a downside, wizards spend a lot of time medding aren't as consistently useful to exp grind groups as other classes for most of their life.  When wizzies finally reach the upper levels, especially once they reach 60 and start getting major AA skills, they become very good in groups and acquire some extremely fast and efficient ways of killing things through AE groups and quad kiting.  Toss in some FT items, high level spells, some c3, a horse, a manarobe (/cheer horsey med), and a few HP buffs to keep you alive, all of a sudden you've got a wizzy thats tossing 2k+ nukes around like mad and almost never stoping to med!<br>
<br>
Differant classes have differant abilities.  Enchanters can DC solo in kael, monks can FD their way out of almost any bad situation, necros can solo extremely well, druids can contribute in virtually every situation and environment, and wizards can blow up a dragon in a single glorious volley of fire.  If you think that wizards are so much better, why dont you go make one for yourself?  Although you'll probably end up quitting somewhere around level 15 =P.<br>
