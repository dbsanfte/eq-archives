<br>
I was in Velk so this is the retake of the guild chat....<br>
<br>
I have a log but its up to like 4mb now so I will spare myself the hell of looking up the damn chat from last night<br>
<br>
K I just got back on after 2hours of being kicked from the server by my ISP when a few members of the guild begin saying in guild that RIP just got to their camp and had began pulling mobs from there spawns.<br>
<br>
So they got pretty pissed as anyone would and asked if anyone in the guild could come and help them hold the spawn...<br>
<br>
Well I said guys... if more members come to hold this all it is going to become is a pissing match about who can get the stronger force...<br>
<br>
I said petition and let the GMs sort it out (seaming it is their job)<br>
<br>
So they did....<br>
<br>
I tuned out after that so I am not even going to add much more.<br>
<br>
Basically I am goign to sum this up as a big misunderstanding by both parties and as such people jump to conclusions and start flaming people (guilds) on nothing more then HE said She said BS....<br>
<br>
Basically group at camp... another group comes wants somethign from camp.... people get pissed and conflict occurs.. instead of resulving the issue one party flames other party.... still no solution is met.... party begins throwing more crap at each other.... no solution met....<br>
<br>
Get my point.... people I want you all to get out of your chairs looks around smell the air go outside a sec....<br>
<br>
Wehn you come back you will prbelly realise that the opposit party is just like u<br>
<br>
They want the same things and feel the same way<br>
<br>
Now use that new found commonality (SP?) to resolve the issue and stay as calm as possible<br>
<br>
If the issue comes to a pissing match all u end up doing is getting the ground dirty and causing bad feelings when u miss and hit someones shoe...<br>
<br>
Thats all good hunting and damn try to think things through before you pee your pants like this time damn &quot;you smell hehe&quot;<br>

<br>
1) It was Shadowknight Only no drop spear (Dark Spear of Venom)<br>
2) NO-ONE asked us - Sirinab spent her time trying (unsuccessfully) to Ninja loot - she never even got a chance to loot the body<br>
3) IF Sirinab had asked us, we would have let a SHADOWKNIGHT loot it - not a monk.<br>
4) Since she didn't - the group decided to trash it - our camp / our loot / our decision<br>

Before bringing more lies and weak accusations to the boards why dont you get your story straight eh?<br>
<br>
And I just have to quote this said by a RIP member about Sirinab...<br>
Now on the other hand she can get out of line sometimes with trains and that banker killing incident. <br>
<br>
Training is completely against the policy of EQ.  Members from your guild saw her train Colach and get him killed.  Any honorable guild who has knowledge of a member that purposefully trains clearly has issues to deal with.  Had you been able to supply the name of the person training you, you can rest assured that they would have been dealt with by NP accordingly.  You openly state you are knowledgful of these actions regarding Sirinab and yet do nothing.  Rather hypocritical to expect NP to deal with unfounded accusations of our members training and responding with poor attitudes when you have substantiated accusations against Sirinab and make no efforts to correct such problems in your own guild.<br>
<br>
I guess it's also somewhat understandable why Luftacos would keep telling NP members to F$*k off as I would have been upset had a group destroyed a weapon I thought I could use.  However now that you know the truth I would hope he wouldn't hold such a negative attitude towards people that did him no wrong.  Btw wouldn't you categorize telling people to F$*k off under the same sort of poor attitude you considered the NP group to have?  Just a thought I had...<br>
<br>
And it's good to hear you still love me Sirinab. =)  I was kind of hurt when you called me a newb though, I was only trying to show you where the zone out to GD was since you had missed finding it about 20 times in a row =/.<br>

On Sirinab and all the love towards her.. No we did not see her actions of late as acceptable.. We had a talk with her and discussed it with the officers.. She is an excellent puller which is why she is still with us..<br>
<br>
Guild name is Rel in Por for those who are wondering..<br>
<br>
I didnt convinently delete the logs.. I was planning on deleting my HDD that night and forgot to save them..<br>
<br>
I ASKed GEMLIN if it was OK to MOVE IN.. He said NO PROB.. that means it was ok.. We didnt steal any camp because you were just pulling from outside.. I told the GM the truth and he realized you were lying.<br>
<br>
And it wasn't Sirinab who trained us obviously we were in mid battle and a stack of giants ran towards us from no where and they were stacked so you could only see one which isnt normal pop or aggro..<br>
<br>
The training part doesn't bother me since there is no proof but Norrath's Pride(ironic name) insulted a few of our members and generally wasn't nice for a group just getting faction. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/4/01 5:39:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Norrath's Pride or lack therof</span><hr size=1> Guildmates said they saw someone run by but didnt get a name..

<br>
Then why raise it in the first place?  It is obvious your intent with this flame was to drag NP's name through the dirt and making unfounded accusations is no way to gain any sympathy.  From the things being relayed to us in guild chat your party was just as rude to them as you claim they were to you.  When people get hot and bothered they say things that are out of character for them and if you plan on judging the whole guild based on the words of a few members who were angry over a situation then so be it.  If everyone on the server judged RIP on the actions of Sirinab or on the words Luftacos had for some of our members you wouldn't exactly come across as having the best rep.  A majority of the Rel in Por people I've met are great players and I certainly don't plan on judging your whole guild based on the actions of a few bad eggs.  I hope it's not too much to ask of you to do the same for us.  Everyone has their bad days and says things they wouldn't say if they had it to do over again (you have no clue what some of those players had gone through in the previous two days).  If you honestly believe you've never said something offensive or rude to someone in all of your eq existence then you are either the nicest person on this planet (and should be doing things besides playing eq =P) or extremely delusional.  I'd say members from both sides owe each other apologies but there's hardly anything I or our entire guild can do to force an apology out of someone.  Our guild members made rude remarks to you over the supposed takeover of their camp and your member made rude remarks to our guildmates because you THOUGHT that they had destroyed a weapon on of your members could use.  <br>
<br>
If you wish to drag this on any farther then by all means do so.  I think it is quite apparent that no one side is completely at fault.... it is also quite apparent that more than half your accusations against NP have turned out to be either false or based on completely unfounded theories.  <br>

P.S. As far as the member from FE complaining about not getting the loot she won I'd like it to be known that she actually got the loot that very night despite the impression she left others with in this thread.

<br>
Does anyone know ANYBODY that does that intentionally? I don't.  There have been misunderstandings, yes.  If this is to be believed as you say it went down than basically what the reader must believe is that a group of NP said &quot;ok here's the plan, we tell them that they can move in and THEN we complain.&quot;<br>
<br>
I could not imagine the worst players of the server doing such a thing (they are more direct saying rude things from the outset), and certainly not as a group or god forbid as a guild &lt;?&gt;.  I mistell 3 or 4 times a night. And the readers know that they mistell as well. Often I say yes or no or np &lt;no problem&gt; as someone intercepts a tell and have to explain.  During combat its much worse; many tells are missed. Many times I hear cries for spirit of wolf.  Although I cast it, I try never to cry wolf myself.<br>

<br>
So here we are a little group of 6, minding our own business.. killing a few giants... when out of nowhere we see Sirinab pulling from our spawns and trying to ninja loot... wasnt long before we got overwhelmed by a fulkl group that started just killing our mobs and then more came in... after a few unsuccessful attempts trying to get them to leave we decide to call a GM. While we waited _sitting_ there, they told us that there was &quot;no such thing as camping&quot; and telling us about PNP and such... which seems to mean &quot;we have more people than you, so you can just get the hell out of our way&quot;. It's really sad the GM couldnt do anything about it because it is true, &quot;there is no such thing as camping&quot;. So basically, big fish eats little fish once again.

The shaman spear that drops in the Keep is 12/19 nice stats GREAT proc, sells for at least 10k (cheap, since it became 'popular' I've seen it for 20k+.. if it were meele-class usable it would probably be 30k+).. it is NOT no drop.  <br>

I have one.. it's gone from Gurunt (who bought it from a friend) to my roommate's shaman to my shaman twink to a guildmate shaman.<br>

&quot;Luftacos was mad that someone in your group destroyed a shaman spear that he could use..&quot;<br>
<br>
In responding to my comments about Luftacos nowhere do you deny that he made somewhat &quot;undesirable&quot; comments towards NP, you merely state that he was mad (somehow making his nasty words to our members okay).  It has been stated more than once in this thread that it was the SK weapon that dropped and not the shammy weapon meaning Luftacos went off on the NP members due to a misunderstanding made completely on his part.  Even if it was the shammy spear Gurunt has just explained that the shammy weapon is NOT no drop meaning that even if there weren't any NP shammies there they could have easily passed it on to one.  So basically the message you have just conveyed is that it was okay for luftacos to cuss out NP members because he was mad (over something he had no right to be) but for the NP members to be insulting to yours is not okay.  This after explaining what a horrible act training is when you have members in RIP who are known trainers themselves.  Seems you are quite the master of double standards in this situation.<br>
<br>
To recap....<br>
1.  You cannot substantiate that NP trained you (and knowing the people that were there I honestly cannot see them stooping to such a level)....<br>
2.  You claim your members were treated poorly by NP members...<br>
3.  You do not deny that your own members treated NP in an equally distasteful manner due to a misunderstanding made by their own ignorance....<br>
4.  You have falsely claimed that NP members destroyed a no drop shammy weapon when in fact it was an sk weapon (not to mention the shammy version of the weapon is not no drop and therefore would have gone to an NP shammy anyways)....<br>
5.  You have admitted that you allow known trainers w/ no respect for the general eq playing population to remain in your guild merely because &quot;they're a good puller&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd say your attempts to trash NP's reputation need a bit more planning out next time.  Your arguments are full of hypocrisy, double standards, and false accusations.  Do I think that if the members from NP had some ugly words for you that they owe you an apology? Yes.  Do I think your members owe NP members an apology for being equally rude, muscling in on their camp, and posting lies all over the flame boards? Yes.  The problem is that until you realize that you need to apply your own ideals to yourself and your guild that you will never actually feel as though you have anything to apologize for.<br>
<br>
Now lets hope eq servers are stable enough to play on so I dont have to get back on here and go through even more of this. =P<br>

I am utterly apalled at my guild for asking you to respect their camp in such a nice cordial way.  HOW DARE THEY!!!! <br>
/sarcasm off<br>
<br>
I mean they could have resorted to comments like &quot;STFU&quot; (Luft) or even telling your group that they had planned on taking all of your camp (Luft again).  I honestly thought that some of those nice, always cool headed people in my guild that were present in kael might have actually let anger get the best of them and have said something wrong to your group.  However after reading that log all I can say is they were a lot nicer to you than just about anyone else in EQ would have been.  I have read the log over and over and have yet to see where A) you asked to loot the SK SPEAR and B) where they made rude comments to you.  If that is what you consider being treated rudely I can't imagine how'd you respond to having to deal with members from your very own guild in the same situation.  Thanks for the barrel of laughs but I'd say that all the evidence points to a misunderstanding between Gaethan and Gemlin followed by you sitting in on their camp out of spite even after saying you were moving past them.  Gemlin even says if he did talk to Gaethan it was in a mistell.  Honestly I believe they should appoint different people from RIP to represent them on flame boards because the ones that have posted here do not do RIP's intelligence/competence level justice at all.<br>

lol i cant stop laughing at this whole post, its so hilarious. you flame a whole guild without proof, maybe those logs you accidentally deleted, should somehow reappear? anyone else buying this bs? than call in the ateam or colombo or maybe matlock. maybe they can get heads or tails out of the reason or the meaning behind this post. <br>
