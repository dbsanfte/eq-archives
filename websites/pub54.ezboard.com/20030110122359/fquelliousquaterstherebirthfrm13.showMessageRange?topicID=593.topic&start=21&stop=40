<br>
I know it's a tragic and sad that Shawn Woolley killed himself, but for his mother to tell 48 hours that he had mental and emotional problems in one sentence, then say, &quot;I found him dead and on his computer was..EVERQUEST&quot; *SOB!* Well hello! There was a pizza box next to his body too. Did it ever occur to her that the pizza he was inhaling could've caused a heart attack too and kill him? She was just finding something to blame and EQ is the best she can come up with? LMAO! She should've blamed herself and her negligence. I don't care how old a person is but if he had problems, she should've gotten him help and kept a close eye on him.  She neglected him and yet she blames a game for his death? Oh please! I'm sure this case has already been argued before, and CBS did a shit ass job at reporting. It's asinine to compare a video game however addicting, to the likes of serial killers and drug addicts in the same program. I'm willing to bet that 90% of the staff working on that program had at least a cup of coffee while working on it. But did they mention the millions of people addicted to caffeine and is jittery as a relapsing heroin addict without their morning cup?  <p><TABLE>

She knew of his condition and did not have him treated?  She knew of this BEFORE he moved out on his own, she stated that on the show.  To blame EQ is rediculous.  The dude was sick and his parents obviously did not do enough about it.  I have 3 children, so I can relate to being a parent.  IF in her situation, I certainly would not allow him to make decisions for himself.  It SEEMS that she had enough proof before she let him move out that he was not capable of making responsible decisions for himself.<br>

Since when did a computer make someone put a gun in their hand and pull the trigger?  If we continue to blame everything else for what people do, there will be no music, video games, TV, religion, etc...  Something that really bothers me is that society does not take responsibility for their own actions.<br>

She knew he was mentally ill and may have trouble distinguishing between fantasy and reality, but she still paid for his EQ. She ignored warning signs of a growing deep depression, again, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> despite the fact that she knew he was mentally disturbed.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> He was shunning society and unwilling to leave the house or even let people in to his home.

I wouldn't do it.. <br>
<br>
<br>
There is only so much a parent can do to treat stuff like that and if the child doesn't want the treatment there is nothing they can do..<br>
<br>
He was 21 right? or was it 20? who says she was paying for his account? Probably when he started he was over 18 so he paided for himself and she couldn't do anything about it.. Now if you wanted to go into taking away his computer or electricity.. None of you here would do that and if you say you will you are just trying to act tough.<br>
<br>
oh and for the &quot;let him leave&quot; thing.. WTF is that? he was over 18 he can leave whenever he wants, she couldn't have stopped him if she wanted to.<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally I'd go for the overparenting arguement than the underparenting one..<br>
<br>
People keep forgetting this guy was over 18.. Most of the arguements in this thread make him sound as if he was 12 or something and his parent could just shut off his computer whenever she wanted..<br>
<br>
I know if my mom had shut off my computer I'd raise hell.<br>
<br>
If you want someone to blame.. Blame himself.. He did this to himself and he knew what he was doing. <p><center>

call me a mean spirited mother fucker, BUT I believe the world itself is a better place without this waste of life on it.  I actually think we should give all parinoid schito's guns, lock them in rooms with EQ, and make them play on sullen Zek.   Walla we can save tons of money on care and all for the one time cleanup fee involved. <br>

Did you read my post? My mother tried that route. It's very difficult to put someone in a ward/mental hospital unless they lose control of themselves. Liz may have tried herself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/unandaben.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nandaben</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Krup Shaman</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/21/02 4:44:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=593.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lol biotch dont know what she asked for :P</span><hr size=1> Hairy--you don't have a clue about the law.<br>

But, please print out a copy of your post and tape it to your refrig.  Recomend you print it in very small type so it'll fit on a itsy bitsy piece of paper. With you having three kids, you will someday be eating those words.<br>

This guy could obviously not take care of himself.  AND if this guy was mentally competent (which is the only way he would not qualify for state help where I am from), then I still blame it on the parents.  According to social services the mother could have turned her son in and they would have gotten him help.  I actually worked in a related field for several years, so I know how the system works.  Whatever state these people are from may have different laws.<br>
<br>
As far as eating these words, I might end up doing just that.  No parents are perfect, and it is easy to stand out here and blame them.  I however have taught all of my children the difference between fantasy and reality.  My children play EQ with me and I take the time to explain it to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tolapumj wanna-be</span><br>  Posts: 904<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/21/02 6:04:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=593.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lol biotch dont know what she asked for :P</span><hr size=1> unless I'm mistaken his mom can't go into his apartment and have social services drag him away.<br>

If people don't want treatment there is nothing a person can do.<br>
<br>
WOuld you have your kid dragged off by them even if you could? didn't think so. <p><center>

If my child refused treatment and refused my help I would have them dragged off.  In the long run, IMO, it would be the best for them...I mean hell look at how this story turned out. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uhairyface1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HairyFace1</A> at: 10/21/02 6:20:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tolapumj wanna-be</span><br>  Posts: 907<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/21/02 6:17:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=593.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lol biotch dont know what she asked for :P</span><hr size=1> that apartment wasn't that bad...
