I am a FUCKTARD&quot;.<br>
<br>
I have never had a run-in with denzians before...and was actually impressed while watching single group kill doze in HoT.<br>
<br>
Now comes the Award ceremony of DUKE SYGHT and how he come to win his new title.<br>
<br>
On Tues nite my guild was just wrapping up HoT and had sent someone out to check quest mobs. The dragonslayers were camped and Scout was not up. After clearing the pit mobs 1 last time, we get a tell from dragonslayers group say Scout had popped. We all head over to tunnel to SG and I ran up to check visual on Scout and she is there with no one else around.<br>
<br>
We have 4 or 5 of us roll to see who does quest since we All have the tools on us and I win. We check buffs and med up so we can knock out the capt real quik and be off. About a min after the roll we here the Capt do his little speach and are wondering WTF. We come to find Duke Syght a rogue and a cleric killing the Capt already. <br>
<br>
Now the OOC starts and we ask why he didnt camp check and he gives reply &quot; You were not ready and we were&quot;. He also says that he had claimed Scout with another character and then camped out to switch. We check our logs and dont see ant Denziens in the zone from when we entered WW.<br>
<br>
I take it to tells and ask when he saw 8 peolpe sitting at end of tunnel did he not check what we were doing( traditional pull spot of capt). Now while sitting there the only person i saw was someone on a horse head to SG no one leaving and know then that he had to be invis to get past us. <br>
<br>
I inform him that if he has claimed a mob and he camps off without someone to hold the mob....he has no claim to it. H e also gives the famous line &quot; GM's will tell you there are no camps&quot;. He then admits to leaving WW and going into SG to &quot;BUFF UP&quot;, Which I then tell him if he leaves the zone He loses camp also. He  then says just come back in 10 hours when she spawns next and I repl;y he could have done the same thing. <br>
<br>
Now a couple things start to puzzle me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hrmm --><img src=http://www.quellious-collective.com/emoticons/confused.gif ALT=":hrmm"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
1. why would someone Uber enuff to trio the capt need to leave zone and buff up?<br>
<br>
2. If they buffed up in SG and no one saw them walk by, How then did they get by us, and why would they need to invis to do it?<br>
<br>
At this time im considering killing my CoV faction early and killing Scout just so he he gets to come back in 10 hours also, or bringing all the giants down on him with a vengence. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smash --><img src=http://www.quellious-collective.com/emoticons/icon216.gif ALT=":smash"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I restrain myself and do neither because I am Not a member of the FUCKTARD ranks. <br>
<br>
I have been carrying the tools for a month now and have helped kill the Capt a few times, because someone claimed them already. It was my turn to do the quest and I was robbed by someone who is so Uber to kill with 3 peeps, that they need a mid lvl Item to put in there inventory.<br>
<br>
Just so you know Syght, being a hi lvl does not give you the OK to be a major ass. If ever I see you In need of assistance and im the closest 1 to you, just keep on looking. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :bad --><img src=http://www.quellious-collective.com/emoticons/bad.gif ALT=":bad"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Is it cold in here, or just me.<br>

Who do you think you are coming here and posting bullshit about Syght when  you only had one encounter with them. Sure you have your side of the story and im sure Syght has his side also.  The rules state whoever engage the mob first and well to me it seems Syght did just that.  Im sure there was some misunderstanding because IVe never seen Syght act out of greed like you described<br>
I for one know Syght very well i also know his GF who plays the rogue you mentioned.  I cannot say enough nice things about him and his GF, they always go out of there ways many many times to help me out and also other members of the guild.  <br>

Syght and crew ran in over us, even seeing us sitting there, didn't holler for a camp check or anything...even went so far as to invis to sneak by us.  Sorry, but anytime I've zoned in to SG (and anyone else that I know) and seen a group of ppl sitting at the tunnel ent I've always had enough common sense to either a) realize that they're probably about to trigger captain, or b) had the common courtesy to at least ask if the group was about to trigger captain before attempting the turn in myself.<br>
<br>
It's a matter of common courtesy.  Acting like a paint chip eating cock gobbler isn't as cool as everyone likes to believe.<br>
<br>
And Iantrix...instead of calling Rev a loser and claiming he's hollering bullshit, why don't you learn the facts of the event.  All you end up doing is looking like you've got yer head so far up Syght's ass that the only time you see daylight is when he yawns. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.houston.rr.com/danday/gaeaan/sig1.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

This type of issue always makes my blood boil! <br>
<br>
FACT #1 as far as the &quot;rules &quot; go .. first engage = mob ownership...... wait, STFU a second ....<br>
<br>
FACT #2 It is not illegal in any part of the United States, Canada or Europe to walk up to someone, take a giant hit from a smoke and blow it in some complete strangers face.<br>
<br>
FACT #3 Anyone with ANY courtesy would see where even though these acts are not &quot;ILLEGAL&quot; they are certainly not the type of behavior that is considered honorable. <br>
<br>
If you suspect someone is camping a mob even though they have not yet engaged said mob and you leapfrog them to engage the mob, YOU are a fucktard! It doesn't matter who you are (refer back to VS flame from years ago) untill people start respecting camp calls this kind of behavior will continue to rear its ugly head here. Fact is you can join the ranks of the well liked and respect camps or you can add yourself to the Kuud, Casey Kroft fucktard club, the CHOICE is yours .... do the right thing.<br>
<br>
P.S. This is a general flame as I don't know the facts about this particular case. <br>

Those are the offical rules, and Syght (knowing it or not) broke them, I wouldn't call him a fucktard for a single instance, but yes it was a dumb move. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://xtctripp101.homestead.com/files/Sigs/Acturian_Sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
If there is one thing that comes to mind it is loopholes.<br>
Sure the GMs would solve such an argument by saying first to engage has the claim, or that there's no such thing as a &quot;Camp&quot; That's the textbook rule that the GM's must follow.<br>
<br>
If you want to use one of these Technicalities to leap frog someone like an A-hole, then that's your choice.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that we ALL know there is an etiquette within the game--GM's ruling or not--You know it, I know it, and the &quot;Joe&quot; from the tiniest guild on the server knows it.<br>
<br>
Don't be a fucktard and pretend it's ok to steal someone's camp just because a GM says there's no such thing as a &quot;camp&quot;<br>

never once was i invis....<br>
hell i was even on a horse, a big white one....<br>

next off, i came from sg, not tov, so i didnt leave the zone to buff up, i buffed up before i zoned in.<br>
<br>
you didnt spawn the mob so you have no more claim to it then i, i already wasted the time buffing that you were currently wasting, im not sure how you figure this was yours.<br>

ever wonder how long ago i had spawned those giants ?<br>
perhaps when your people were just showing up ?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aillron>Aillron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/9/03 6:26:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=784.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/aelron/myhomepage/nopst.jpg?mtbrand=AOL_US WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Member of FT list</span><hr size=1> Syght,<br>

Giants weren't up, only the scout.  Don't know where this whole thing about the giants already being triggered and Syght was trying to solo pull the captain while we were just arriving comes from.  <br>
<br>
Syght and friends never even showed up in zone til after we had buffed and I had medded back about 70m from oom.<br>
Why do I know this?  We zoned in hoping to do Captain and Dragonslayers both.  By hitting that little / button that magically shows who's in the zone, I see that it's just us and the Dragonslayer guy.  So we ooc camp check hoping that maybe he's just there farming furs or something.  When we heard him say Dragonslayers were camped, did we go off and try to engage em?  Nope, we sucked it up and just went after Captain instead, like any decent person that recognizes that there are camps would. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :brow --><img src=http://www.quellious-collective.com/emoticons/eyebrow.gif ALT=":brow"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We did our camp check, only Dragonslayers were called because (drumroll) nobody else was there except for FE and the guy doing Dragonslayers.  I'm intentionally repeating this over and over with hope that it will eventually sink in <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :bang --><img src=http://www.quellious-collective.com/emoticons/banghead.gif ALT=":bang"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If Syght would have been in the zone at anytime during our run from ToV to SG, he would have seen the camp checks and he could have responded to the camp checks.  None of this would even be up here now.  We don't care if we lose a race to a mob.  We don't care if something we want is camped.  We just suck it up and come back another day when it's free.  <br>
<br>
We do care when we get ran over when we were clearly there first. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :bad --><img src=http://www.quellious-collective.com/emoticons/bad.gif ALT=":bad"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lotaneq>LotanEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sebilite Guardian</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/9/03 8:19:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=784.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Member of FT list</span><hr size=1> Well, as I said I wasn't there and was going form what had been posted.  All I can say though is it is not our style (Denizens) to run people over ect, hell we are a really small guild, we couldn't run people over in most cases if we even wanted to (not that we do). And I can understand you are mad if you feel you were run over,and I apologize if you feel that way.  It happens to us too, a lot really.  I guess I just know Syght is getting a lot worse rep here then he should.  He can be rough around the egdes at times <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.jamezbrown.com/mysmilies/ups/icis/ices_lol_ani.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but it isn't his style to blatenly take spawns.
