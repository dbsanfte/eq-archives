<br>
&quot;They apparently knew who the puller was, but were not contacted by DB at all for the near half hour they were there.....&quot;<br>
<br>
The other MB claim they somehow didn't know there was a raid there.   How could this be if DB had talked to them and made their intentions clear?  I assume you are calling azile and Karraway liars then?  Oh and you would also be calling Palazious a liar also.. as he told me this as well.  <br>
<br>
<br>
YOU Fkin.... YOU think DB had equal blame.  Not me.  This equal blame is YOUR assertation, not mine.  The only time I used equal blame is in response to YOUR claims of it.   You are the only one trying to make a case for DB having equal blame.  You don't have to do that, if I had any interest or belief in that, I would have made that insinuation or case myself.  <br>
<br>
If you wish to continute to place equal blame on DB, go ahead, leave me out of it.<br>
<br>
Is that not clear enough?  I never said equal blame, I never implied it.   I said it was a MB team issue.  Do you not understand what I mean when I say &quot;MB&quot;?   <br>

<br>
Karraway helped so many people thoughout his time in EQ. He helped me get my white scale which I had needed for the longest time. He helped so many more people with as he posted Pally books, white scale, red scales, and others. <br>
<br>
You have no reason to assume he is a jerk till you have met him and gotten to know what kind of a person he is. The only &quot;jerks&quot; im seeing ATM is people like you assuming others of being jerks from what 1 person has told you. If you havent seen about a month ago someone said the same thing about Karraway being some sort of jerk or what not. If you check that post you will see how many people will come to his side and tell you 1st hand he is far from.<br>

Gurunt sorry but you said the words - its pretty clear you implied that DB should have been more vocal. Again considering the *many* other comments you have made in these threads its quite clear you still are trying to shift blame. Sorry but its fairly apparent that apart from Denia perhaps few people if any are buying into it - Have a nice day! =)<br>

No Fkin, YOU implied this.  <br>
<br>
I was told by palaz that they did not send tells, and karraway and azile said they did not know they were there.  Both sides support this, so I just assumed it might be true.<br>
<br>
It's obvious you feel DB is in the wrong here.  DB says they didn't send tells, and you say that means they were at fault.   That is your opinion and that's fine.<br>
<br>
Again, Fkin, you are the only one that thinks DB is to blame for not sending tells to everyone.  You are the only one who brought this up, or implied anything.<br>
<br>
How is this ignoring the problem?  If I called DB jackass gimps that would be better?  That is how you handle these sort of things.....  You already state they are half to blame for this incident. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

I on the other had place 80 percent of the blame on your guildmate and 15 percent on the other mb wizards, and I have been clear about that point. You on the other hand have gone to extremes to either paint Db or the other mana burners as the primary guilty parties. Course we all know its *never* waif people being bad its just the man trying to keep you down right? - nice try.<br>

I have done no such things.  YOU are the only one to say DB was in the wrong at all.  Implied or otherwise.  You are the only one to say the &quot;other&quot; manaburners are &quot;primarily guilty&quot;.<br>

<br>
about Verbo have to say 2 things.<br>
<br>
from what I've seen Verbo is an outstanding guy granted it hasnt been too long but thats what I see and if Eadric has so much hatred for him.. Why not try to work it out like gentlemen?<br>
<br>
The other raid is partially to blame too... If they had been straight foward with Ryohki on the 20min thing that would have never happened. It just ended up in a big mess.<br>
<br>
Stereotyping wizards on the actions of a few misunderstanding or not is WRONG... Quellious is the best server on all of everquest... Even the jerks are nicer than jerks on other servers. As stated before there is NO burn team.. If you want me to create a burn team you won't like it.  If you think its all about loot farming then ask those soloing shaman who camp in CT and camp the FS boots and sell them for 80k a pop.<br>
<br>
Is farming worse when its for mobs that drop epic peices?<br>
<br>
Also note a lot of the wizards hand out portions of the loot.. how many shamans do you see handing out FS boots to anyone? even their guild? <p><center>

Thats about as meaningful as a wiz coming and MBing someone.  yes they are SO much better of a player for that.  I dont care if you can kill anyone in PvP.  As far as im concerned it means jack towards real playing ability.  Being able to work together in a team to take down mobs is true playing ability in EQ. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143487">
