He was angry and hurt that the situation the day before in Hate had ended in not just 1, but 2 instances (which, even though I can't justify the second one, but seeing the earlier actions and actually being there sorta put the nail in the coffin) in UP not simply stepping up and saying &quot;Whatever, we'll finish what we're doing and leave you guys to do whatever&quot; but they blatantly threw the rules out the window and said &quot;Screw you, were gonna fix you real well, then laugh at you while you clean up&quot;. The way I see it, It's an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth here. Tristadorn saw a situation where the mob that was &quot;somewhat&quot; engaged really wasn't going to die anytime soon (if this half-cocked aggro crap were real, then we could all park monk toons near dragons and so forth and engage then keep feigning them off and call the mob &quot;engaged&quot;) so he acted. It wasn't a case of training the holy hell out of a raid and camping the clerics (well, attempting to) and then I believe doing it again just out of spite. I doubt Trist ran up and laughed at the enchanter after they killed Cazel, either. A small act of retribution constructed by an appropriate entity, if you ask me. <br>
<br>
The simple fact that we, as Radiant did NOT feel the need to come to the boards first and post a flame against UP in the first place, but an appropriate reaction justified by the unwillingness on their part to truly &quot;engage&quot; the mob, is what caused this flame anyway. So, in short, Ulwern tried to piss in someone elses booties, then got scared when the guy that put the boots on came a' lookin for him, and, IN HIS OWN LOGS, threatened that he was coming to the flame boards to look for back-up from you guys. It was working at first, too, but now, as the shit has hit the fan and people are starting to notice the truth behind the matter, the threatening visage has faded off of Ulwern's face, and he's /bow'd out before even more items jump up on the table. <br>
<br>
Sometimes, and usually in a riot, the guilty party that started the uproar will see the awesome power of the truth, and ultimately slink to the back to cower in the dark. I hope you can see well out of the shadows, Ulwern. <p><img src=http://www.webspawner.com/users/zodiack/zodiack.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uulwern.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ulwern</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>F`Salta</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/22/02 2:50:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=534.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good ole Radiant? eh?</span><hr size=1> Lets get this settled once and forever Zodiack &lt; Serpent back in the day.

To put this lame, we/you/not us/he trained us story, if one was to train they shall forever aggro right?  Then why was I able to sit through that entire train that I pulled? It was not us from the start to the end. Maybe my DE pun was in bad form, was your remarks in OOC with slander good form as well as we said nothing through out that mess?  Once again, I brought this to the forum same reason why Radiant brought it forums from ADD.  It was not going to get fixed in tells obviously, maybe public opinion that will possibly give assistance to both our flaws of logic.

You're right. We couldn't figure out the easy vindi pull! So we asked for advice, we got advice and we won. Dead Vindi. Yeah... I guess that makes us newbs. If sucking up pride and asking for education and advice to take out new things for us is newbish, call us the newbie brigade because (unlike your poor uneducated ass), we are willing to learn anything and everything it takes to make us better.<br>

But when the post touches on the guild I recently recruited with, joined, and contains a bunch of people I know and love, I am inclined to make a response.<br>
<br>
First let me talk a little about Radiant.  I recruited with Radiant for a week about, yes only a week, and in that week we killed rumblecrush, Vindi, Sev, golems in fear, and royals in chardok in that order.  I am a firm believer in raid attendence barring RL interference so I attended all the raids I heard about to give Radiant a better chance to know me (they found out I am a little deranged!).  Radiant is a medium sized guild yet they managed to take down a mob like Vindi (yes I know it is easy for some guilds but was Radiant's first try).    We wiped the first 2 pulls of Vindi but Radiant picked itself back up and persevered enough to kill Vindi on the third try.  That is how Radiant is, yes there will be wipeouts on raids but they will always pick themselves back up, restrategize and conquer the mob that they are fighting.  We heard that Vindi was up but contrary to believing we would be unable to take down Vindi with the people we had online we maintained a sanguine attitude and said what the hell, lets give it a shot.  We are extremely confident in our own abilities to get the job done and the worse thing that can happen is the raid gets wiped a few times, you get rezzed, and go home knowing that you tried your best, and prepare for the next time you face the mob.<br>
<br>
I was extremely impressed with the mobilization and caring attitude expressed by all.  Whether letting a LC members tag along on a raid to get a shard for the VT key quest, helping a member camp the elusive shards in Sf, or helping with another guild's slaying or Ragefire, Radiant is always out and about helping each other and even non members occaisonally.  <br>
<br>
Using my sense summoned spell I Found out Sev was up, but we had only 14 people online about yet our leader Trist said that we were damn well going to try to kill him being as we had 2 warriors needing just the green scales and blade (neither was on at the time but that did not stop us) from queen. (yes, we beat the Mbers there !)  Rumples, the previous day was auctioning to buy the green scale but he woke up the next day finding it already in his possession.  A quick queen kill and he was epicced.  <br>
<br>
Radiant is a good guild and thrives on helping others.  We just got another cleric epic recently and completed another ranger epic while in hate.   We use a similar loot system as Lc where if a item drops, you send a tell to a loot officer or Trist saying you would like to put your name up for it, that is where one of the loot officers decides among a number of factors who best deserves the item.   I have yet to see one item distributed unfairly.  It is a system conducive to need...not greed.<br>
<br>
Now...back to the topic.  I was in PoH when this occured and I know from my experiences with Radiant that they would never intentionally ruin the gaming experience of others.  We were confident of our force to fight into hate instead of running to safe camp and ressing there.  We would have no cause to train it.  We pulled a few mobs to port in until it was clear to move to safecamp...there was no way we could have trained that many mobs from port in.  Trist died from sort of chain aggro that we thoought you guys had initiated.  He was summoned and promptly killed.  This may or may not have been true as there were having pulling issues all weekend in hate.  Mobs pathing strangely and such.  We make it to safecamp and mobs suddenly come out from nowhere They did not follow us to safecamp cause they did not come from that direction.  You don't get that many mobs in camp by accident.  I believe there was some insidious intent on the behalf of UP to train us.  After we killed them, we were angry and rightly so, and wanted nothing more to do with your guild though.  We ignored our impulsiveness to train you guys like you did us.  Moved on to the 2nd floor and killed stuff there where we encounted some more chain aggro (or not, as someone saw a UP member there), got a ton of mobs in camp, wiped, commenced with Cr, yada yada.  Then to top of matters you guys come up there to laugh at us?  I mean, my gosh that is just beyond immature.  It is extremely tough to get me angry but the sequence of events that occured in Hate managed it.  I did not openly say anything to UP because I prefer to avoid confrontation, not contribute to it (reason I don't usually post on the flame boards) but libelous words spoken against people who have proven to me their benevelent intent irked me like no other.    It makes me sad that events like this happen on Quellious and even more so when it involves people I have come to care about.<br>
<br>
I wasn't at the Cazel killing so not going to post my opinion on that as it would prolly be bigoted towards UP from the recent meltdown in hate.<br>
<br>
Btw, Thanks Lc for lending a hand with Rumblecrush the other day before you went to VT.  Don't know whether we needed the help or not as it was our first try on him but it was welcome nonetheless ).<br>

The first time in Hate, we knew you were in Hate, so we just got to Safecamp and camped out till the next day.  But would you do that for us??  Nope, that's obvious.  <br>

Cazel- I wasn't there for this, wish I was though. So I could at least know what happened.  But I can truly say, I know for a fact that Trist would never KS or try to hurt someone by taking over or engaging someone elses kill.  Thats it plain an simple.<br>

But for any enchanters reading this who still need Cazel there's a secret. Cazel has an insane regen rate and thus a druid dotting or (and more importantly) an enchanter dotting doesn't make a dent. Plus, he summons which just generally sucks for most casters. The trick is that a disease dot takes out his regen. Grab a necro, sk or shammie (dunno, beastmaster? yeah, I'm clueless about the class). Get them to cast a disease dot on Cazel, and now it'll all fall into place. Get Cazel snared, fear him and have at him. I was able to knock down Cazel about 20 min before servers went down one night with the help of a 50 something shaman, druid and a L40 something rogue. Couple minutes later dead giant and one utensil to tick off the epic scavenger list. Immortals of Justice so rocked. I miss Raymhund and the other people from way back then.<br>
<br>
And for some unsolicited moralizing, takes two to fight, and one to make a peace offering. I guess everyone draws their own line about where they will and won't go in defense of their honor. It's just too bad that there's a bunch of relatively innocent people who'll end up being the focus of a game of tit for tat. Sounds like both parties are letting themselves sink to a lower standard than they usually hold themselves to. Personally, the person/guild who makes the selfless gesture gets respect from me. <br>

I guess I'd get more worked up about this if it was the Wraith of the Shissar, or some other actual hard or rare part of the epic quest.  It's not.  This is some wimpy sand giant that spawns relatively often in a newbie zone, whose item drop is tradable.  Is there anyone who's ever had their epic held up and incompleted for weeks because they were only missing the spoon?<br>
<br>
Now that that's said.. I am a completely neutral party who doesn't know anyone involved here personally.  I'll just remind Tristadorn/Radiant.. a while back, you were complaining about losing out on the real prize enchanter Epic piece, the Fear part, to another guild I forget (ADD?  Yeah, I suffer from Attention Deficit Disorder, your point?).  Now, you knowingly take actions that lead other people to look upon you the same way, though admittedly to a much less important creature.  If at any point you ever plan to take a moral high road, you had better make sure you keep to it yourself by keeping your reputation squeaky clean.  Doing things like this and saying they're justified because &quot;the other guys trained us/were rude/looked at us funny&quot; just doesn't cut it.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you don't want to take the moral high road anymore.. then welcome to the dark side!  Population, me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Shit, if its really that important, I know every time I've ran thru Oasis lately (which is rare, though) I've seen Cazel up...it is just a freaking spoon, and like its been said earlier, its easily gotten...if I see him up, I'll freaking call you if it'll make you happy...I don't even think any more of our chanters need the stupid thing, but I may be wrong.<br>
<br>
My whole thing was the Hate raid. I did'nt ever /ooc anything to UP while we were there, all I did was casually come over and /yawn at the ones still standing there (and checking our pile of NPC corpses, I reinterate!) for pulling such a bullshit stunt. Hell, I could run straight through the middle of the zone and not pull THAT much aggro, I'm serious about that one.<br>
<br>
And I gave love to the chanters, read up a little bit. I gave love to our chanters that kept that nasty mess mezzed. I did also state that it was a game, so what if I used an extreme comparison? Ok, so a guy steals a Coke and a candy bar from a store...we don't let that kind of loopy shit pass either, right? Extreme measures call for extreme comparisons, my momma always told me.<br>

Would she have won? No prolly not, but she was actively trying and therefore you should have A. waited for her to go OOM and die/zone. B. help her or C. just leave.<br>
<br>
Cazel is a very Iffy spawn...some times hes up ALL the time, and others, he doesnt show his ugly self for a week.  I've camped him for my chanter in the past and I've helped other chanters do it as well.  To say that &quot;it's only Cazel&quot; or &quot;it's just a droppable spoon&quot; is just ignorant.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what bad blood your two guilds have, this type of action is unacceptable, especially after reading a Radiant flame a lil while back where Radiant Folks bitched out ADD folks for stealing the shissar wraith in PoF after a radiant member had already engaged it.  Yeah harder mob and rarer, but same basic principle.  Seems to me this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black.<br>

<br>
That's like being &quot;somewhat&quot; pregnant. There is no somewhat about it. The mob is either engaged or it is not engaged. PNP doesn't make allowances for players to determine when it's &quot;okay&quot; to KS a mob. Someone actually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  saw</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> this mob engaged and felt that, due to the bad mojo between his guild and this guild, he had a right to give their enchanter the shaft. (Thx generalizations by association. Touch of irony: at the same time you reserve the right to flame/correct anyone who comes close to making a generalization about your guild and/or its members.)<br>
<br>
As for your criminal analogy, you leave out a key point: you're not the judge, jury, or executioner (i.e., GM). You're a victim to what you felt was intentional training. It was your duty to /petition it. You're not anything special that gets to met out justice as you see fit, lest every blue server be a haven to deranged vigilantes. No matter what angle you approach it from and how you present it, two wrongs don't make a right. Didn't your momma teach you well? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 9/22/02 8:46:37 am<br></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font> <br> <br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
