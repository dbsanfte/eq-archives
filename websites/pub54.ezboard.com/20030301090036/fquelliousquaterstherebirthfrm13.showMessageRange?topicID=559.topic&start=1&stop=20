What does everyone think about this?<br>
<br>
Many people think highly of this idea.<br>
<br>
I am a bit skeptical.<br>
<br>
AS a wizard I think highly of ks groups for many reasons.<br>
<br>
now before you start the flaming because I know what you are thinking =)  I got a few arguements to share.<br>
<br>
1.  Ks classes or classes that need less group attention will get the shaft on good groups because they are no longer needed to get exp or no longer needed to be attended to.<br>
<br>
2.  Exp so irrelevant from the raid kills that people will actually miss not getting exp or getting exp in a ks group.<br>
<br>
3.  Competition amongst the high damage classes for the kills makes things die faster.. If this feature goes it.. Whats to prevent people from going afk on the whole raid meaning slower kills and longer raids.<br>
<br>
I like Ks groups.. They add excitement to my class and other classes... Without that added excitement raids will get more tiresome and just plain boring.  Even if I don't get the kill.. It is still exciting to challenge someone else for the kill.. <br>
<br>
I also don't see ks groups as a problem.. If the group organizer took the time to set up fair groups then there would be no or few groups that get too much exp.<br>
<br>
There are other bonuses to using a raid group system but I think the majority of the people who are in support of this is because they want an end to ks groups and more of a share of the exp.<br>
<br>
I assume this feature will be optional but these are still concerns. <p><center>

This also allows VI to give Uber Mobs huge xp bonuses so that there is a noticable raise for everyone on the raid. Also think about PoP, addition of 5 levels that have to be obtained in raid enviroments, would be kind of shitty to see the group of wizards in the corner get 65 while the rest pray for a couple kills here and there. <br>
<br>
Personally I think its a good idea, the whole KS group arguement doesn't hold up :P <p><center>

Let me outline a few of the reasons.<br>
<br>
This works to ameliorate several issues, above and beyond the issue of shared experience gain.<br>
<br>
The first reason is that a raid leader can control looting and keep a tighter set of reins on the raid. The simple visual tool of being able to see raid groups and their formations is helpful, especially on larger raids.<br>
<br>
The second issue this ameliorates is what I consider the 'problem' of the KS group. I cannot count the times that people have over-spent mana, or pulled aggro causing ping-pong attempting to be 'the KS group'.<br>
<br>
The whole concept of a KS group causes a systemic concern because, though it does foster competition and potentially faster kills, it also fosters poor raid behavior. The consequences of this become most apparent when someone gets summoned and killed within the first few seconds of the fight other than the person slowing, tashing, or otherwise performing invaluable debuffing tasks which generate near instant aggro.<br>
<br>
Case in point: the overuse of rain spells, discs, etc. I cannot count the number of times casters in raids I have attended get summoned and killed due to over-using their rain spells in an attempt to slide more damage into the raid situation...or the number of times that a truly bad mob has shown up in camp either by accident (mispull, lag, what have you) and the raid has spent out most of it's mana and/or discs due to attempting to get a KS on the previous, easier mob that had been in camp.<br>
<br>
Though this behavior does not always result in a wipe-out, for the most part this becomes highly dangerous in situations where there is very little or no margin for error.<br>
<br>
The raid system reduces a raid down to what it really is...a vital team effort to attain goals which are unreachable by the standard six person party. Yes, you run the risk of people taking extended afk breaks during raids...but really, if someone is that inattentive, why are you raiding with them in the first place? Raids, which are for the most part a function of the guild system, are on a deeper level a facet of friendship displayed by a group of people joining together to accomplish a singular goal. Attending a raid, unless it is specifically directed (aka: *your* epic raid), means that you come knowing you may walk away with nothing in hand other than a feeling of accomplishment at defeating some large creature.<br>
<br>
If this goal does not fit into your plans...then why attend a raid? It defies logic to attend a raid and 'try' to earn experience with the KS group rather than form a solid six person group and *know* you will be gaining the experience every kill.<br>
<br>
By wiping out this systemic concern, it then becomes easier to teach and indoctrinate the newer raiders in the ways of efficient and methodical raiding. This is not to say that they will instantly become better raiders...instincts and battle awareness are not things one can 'train' someone in, it is garnered through experience and on some level a natural talent. It will significantly shorten the training and learning time for many new raiders by removing the troublesome first phases that many (not all) raiders experience where they feel that gaining experience on a raid is the *most* important aspect.<br>
<br>
I look forward to the new raid system, and I hope that it will help discourage some of the poor raid habits that float around out there, especially in pick up raids...which is for many people their first experience truly raiding.<br>

<br>
&quot;1. Ks classes or classes that need less group attention will get the shaft on good groups because they are no longer needed to get exp or no longer needed to be attended to.&quot;<br>
<br>
By less group attention, are you talking about classes that don't need as much healing attention like rogue/wizard/monk/ranger if they watch their aggro? Somehow I doubt guilds are going to stop inviting these classes to their raids. Nobody likes a 20-minute fight to drag out longer than necessary. That's the whole point of high damage classes; kill the mob before the clerics run OOM. They can’t be replaced until casters can dish out spell damage without aggro and warriors catch up to rogue damage.<br>
<br>
&quot;2. Exp so irrelevant from the raid kills that people will actually miss not getting exp or getting exp in a ks group.&quot;<br>
<br>
Boo hoo. So the usual KS groups in your/someone's guild will no longer hog all the XP. Before someone says I'm just a jealous non-guild player, I've gained enough raid XP grouped with Draug and another rogue to nullify death penalties or camp with more XP than I started out with when I arrived. But that's my attitude: let everyone gain something for their time instead of a few choice people, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> usually</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the better equipped and higher level, reap all the rewards.<br>
<br>
&quot;3. Competition amongst the high damage classes for the kills makes things die faster.. If this feature goes it.. Whats to prevent people from going afk on the whole raid meaning slower kills and longer raids.&quot;<br>
<br>
Absolutely nothing. Just like there is nothing that prevents people from going AFK today.

Since reasoning with some people is impossible, I'm glad that another way has been found to shut them the hell up.  This system will also improve the raid leaders control over the raid, and make it a more cohesive unit that will be easier to set up and operate.  Most of the good points have already been made, so I won't repeat.  My opinion - can't wait for this to go live.<br>

<br>
ROFL... that is Gaythan in a nutshell, well said.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of raid exp, those classes that didn't have a part of getting exp (such as a full cleric group for communication reasons) can now get their equal share.<br>
<br>
Think if you were a cleric Gaythan, you have, pretty much, no control over the exp you get... where is the ks'ing excitement for them?  No way 6 clerics in a group can equal the dps of a purposely made KS group or something... this makes it equal for all.. which is how it should be.. that way they can contribute their heals to the raid while not having to use up mana or whatever to try and KS to get their share.<br>
<br>
Now, from a raid/guild leader perspective.... ONE LESS F*CKING HEADACHE TO WORRY ABOUT <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As it stands there 6 level 60's can group to take down mobs and get experience.  But with PoP coming out, how in the hell can we expect to achieve level 65?  You damn well know that mobs in PoP are going to require coordinated raids to take down or at the very least 2 groups.  Does that mean that everyone is going to be level 60 forever?  I like this idea.  It rewards all of the participants of a raid with exp.  Because we all now that not everyone can get the loot that drops unless several cycles are done.  So at least this is a small reward to the participants. <p><img src=http://www.telusplanet.net/public/sashcro1/Grabem-staff.gif> <BR>

How about those times where you are just hanging out with guildmates... be it for a quest... or an epic mob that doesn't take a raiding force but your guildmates want to show you their support.  That 7th, 8th, or 9th person can be part of the group now.<br>

As a raid leader, I hate it when people whine about not getting exp. I also hate it that on raids, only one group of people generally gets &quot;rewarded&quot; for the kills, other than possibly with loot. I think this is going to be a great thing.<br>
<br>
As a raid leader, I also like the upcoming administrative functions. Assigning specific looters will rock my world. I just hope loot is broadcast over the &quot;raid&quot; channel like it is over the group channel now. Then there will never be a question where something goes.<br>
<br>
Although it makes me wonder how the exp system will work. It would be amazing to be able to make up &quot;death loss&quot; experience for everyone on a raid, but how will experience be divided? Instead of dividing that frog/sarnak among 6 people, now you're dividing it among 30-40 people. Sounds like no one's bar will even move if this is reality. Take an entire raid of mob x's experience being divided 30-40 ways and no one's bar may move at all...if that is the case...then the purpose of the new raid commands/functions is solely control for the RL, which STILL puts it above and beyond how things are now.<br>

Why in gods name would you stop trying as hard because you can't &quot;ks&quot;..... thats like saying, oh Druids can CH now so I(as a cleric) am not gonna do it and go afk the whole fight.  It doesnt work like that, everyone has a job.... your job is damage and if you arent doing it then its as easy as getting someone else that will.  You say that there's like a competition to get the KS, well why not just do the max amount of DPS your capable of every fight and you wouldn't hav to worry about it.  Your logic is a cluster fuck of nothingness.  I think you sometimes don't think before you post things.  And yes he does like to shoot himself in the foot.<br>

I promplty pulled them aside, and told them to get their heads out of their fucking asses, and if they realized what they are doing could wipe an entire raid, and it would be *THEIR* fault alone, and no-one elses.<br>

The druid had no idea, understood,and apologized. the enchanter was completely taken aback, also shocked to hear that I had learned this.<br>

The fact anyone PURPOSELY tries to OUTDAMAGE people on raids makes you look like utter fucking morons. a dead raid does a whopping 0DPS, gets no loots, and gets no mobs. <br>
<br>
If your one of those people who goes and tries to get exp on raids, you need to rethink your strategy a bit. a rogue I know had to sacrafice some DPS on one of our raids by switching to a slower weapon to help the MT keep aggro. <br>

<br>
It is more fair.  It's frequently not possible to balance groups so that there isn't one that gets the kill most of the time.  Pull team usually has the toughest job and takes the most risks but they don't always get XP to reward them for their sacrifices and hard work.  If you participate in raid no matter what group you are in, you should share the experience gained from kill.<br>
<br>
Aye, I know you shouldn't worry about XP on raids but people do.   I am tired of people doing stupid things to try to KS or whining about not being able to KS.  I really shouldn't have to tell people to wait for call and not overnuke.  It doesn't happen often but it does happen and most people do know better.  With new system, they won't gain anything from it (and I can kick them out if they don't follow instructions, go AFK too much, or goof off a lot.)<br>
<br>
Assigning looters would make life easier too, especially on epic raids.  I hate having to lock a corpse in order to protect a no drop quest piece.<br>
<br>
There are better ways to find excitement that trying to KS from your guildies and friends. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=Green>Moderator</font></span><br>  Posts: 472<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/4/02 11:36:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=559.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ha</span><hr size=1> So basically the feature blows because it will make the raids less boring for all the classes but wizards.
