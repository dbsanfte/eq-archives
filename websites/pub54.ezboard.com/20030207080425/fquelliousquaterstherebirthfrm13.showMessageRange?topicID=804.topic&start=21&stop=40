The whole game is set-up for a variety of players. Some that want to engage in the merchant side can, those that like to quest can, those who like to raid can, etc. etc. Why be upset if you do not understand why another wants to play a game different then you do. <br>
  I for one, not having a guild enchanter capable of casting KEI at moment live in nexus looking for that hit of C3. What a blessing it is when I don't have to wait 30 minutes for a chanter to decide to be kind enough to set-up shop. <br>
  As far as the spam goes, does a message in your chat box bother you that bad????  Seriously such a trivial thing. I see just as many /shout looking for port to... or looking for c3 (even seconds after the latest chanter /auction. So, what difference it make. One should just take bazaar, nexus and POT with a grain of salt and accept it as a gathering place and also a zone filled with spam.<br>
  If you want to complain about something...make it for the person who says &quot; Porting for donation&quot; or &quot;Casting kei for donation&quot;, then complain when donation isn't high enough. Much better to say what you mean. &quot;Porting for 20pp&quot; or &quot;Casting KEI for 100pp&quot;.  Makes much more sense and clears up confusion eh. I almost always just default the 100pp on each kei. But am amazed when I hear someone complain or not give a buff till they get paid....I am sure this has to be an old topic...but People this isn't a Donation this is a Payment! Say what you mean!<br>
Oh well, enough said I shall go back to leveling now but one last parting statement. GO CHANTERS! As a wizard I am extremely happy to see /auction Casting kei at bazaar hallway.<br>
                             Happy Hunting <br>

I began playing and had absolutely no idea about anything or how to achieve anything. Starting out can be very discouraging as you all know. She began talking to me one day when she saw me in a newbie zone and ever since then has been my best friend in game.Being new and not knowing anyone is really tough. <br>
<br>
She gave me a weapon one day and it made me so happy that she thought of me and how I would benefit from it. There was no way I could have ever afforded it in the near future. I am a monk so its not even like she is going to benefit from me buying KEI from her. I played at first with absolutely no gear of any kind, she has donated several things to help outfit me. Having a well equipped char makes the game much more enjoyable. She has also helped me with my research of my character and what would best suit it. At this time she is helping me get together the pieces to make a Black Pantherskin Tunic.<br>
<br>
As far as making money in the Nexus, everyone plays the game to their own liking. Some people like the social aspect and some like the hunting and the thrill. I have sat and watched Gingerr in the Nexus, people flock to her. She has the same customers day in and day out. I have heard a number of people in /ooc say that they keep coming back because of her personality. I can't imagine the friendships she has made. If people didn't want or need the buff there would be no reason for her to be there. Obviously there is a market for it, how can you fault someone for that. <br>
<br>
Regardless of how much a spell costs people have a right to do what they choose and should not be flamed for it. This is a service that a number of people are providing. The money being made should not matter. The fact is that this is a game and we wouldn't play it if we didn't enjoy it. You have to take things in stride because we are never going to like what everyone else is doing or saying, as is the same in life. <br>
<br>
I felt that I should say something when I was told that there was some negative things being said about Gingerr because she has truly enhanced my game experience. I also want to thank her for everything she has done for me....even when she got me killed power leveling me...lol. <br>

Wizards have pretty good mana regen and with my robe and horse, I rarely miss not having it.  It doesn't bother me that people sell it, or that many of my friends won't play if they don't have it on them.<br>
<br>
I do have an issue with the amount that has become standard.  100plat seems WAY out of line for a buff -- and yes, I know that this is often a suggested amount and I am pretty sure that most of the chanters would accept less from a low level player.<br>
<br>
Sure, it takes 900 mana, but if the enchanter gets only three customers then that is only 300 mana each.  People don't offer druids 100pp for a port and that is 300 mana PLUS the zoning time.  How much do you think most people pay a Mage for a summoned focus item or a talisman of return (300 mana, by the way)?  Usually, nothing but a thanks.  People stopped paying for SoW ages ago.  What the hell, it is just mana.<br>
<br>
So what is it about KEI that makes it worth paying 100pp for?  Someone mentioned above that they would pay for the convenience of getting it NOW rather than waiting for the group to fill, and I understand that.  But if you are gonna fill the group, 500pp to cast a 12 second, 900 mana spell is a bit much.<br>

<br>
I feel that I should really address this before anything else.  This was a very specific instance.  Gingerr had went afk for perhaps 5 minutes.  One must understand -- Gingerr is very popular -- and rightly so, she is quite the sweetheart!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :crush --><img src=http://www.quellious-collective.com/emoticons/crush.gif ALT=":crush"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So I thought I would surprise her when she returned with a large bunch of her admirers waiting for her services.  This was a one-time thing, so I'm not sure what &quot;...for a few days straight...&quot; was in reference to.<br>
<br>
But that aside, I'm surprised to hear that someone is upset with us.  We do our best to be friendly and pleasant with everyone, very accomodating in many situations.  I enjoy working with Gingerr, we have had some fun conversations, and it's not hard to tell that she has a heart of gold.<br>
<br>
So, as long as I'm able...<br>
<br>
With every c3 you buy from Gingerr, you get a free bst c2 from me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.jamezbrown.com/mysmilies/ups/icis/ices_lol_ani.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

What determines the value of an item? (In this case spell).<br>
<br>
It's not the usefullness of it, or wear it drops, but the rarity of the spell.  Yes, KEI may only drop off certain boss mobs X, Y and Z in Luclin, and Malo/ Torpor/ Poxx/ VotB, (etc), drop off &quot;lowbie&quot; Kunark mobs, but they are both just as rare (and if I was a betting man, I'ld say Malo/ Torpor are TONS rarer then KEI). <br>
<br>
That was my point, about the cost of the spell, not the location of where it drops.<br>

<br>
C3 drops off Rhag2 or better, which requires a raid for all but the higher end people, which have c3 or better anyway.<br>
<br>
Therefore, c3 is harder to get than Torpor. C3 probably is a rarer drop cus the mobs that drop it are on 3-7 day timers not 30mins - 4hrs too.<br>
<br>
So i conclude: You are comparing apples to oranges.<br>
<br>
Its like someone telling me Garrisons Superior Sundery (lvl 60 wiz nuke off Emp Ssra) is the same difficulty, therefore should have the same price, as Moonfire (lvl 60 dru nuke off any boss mob in luclin).<br>
<br>
And raluvin is right in his post too. Casters shouldnt complain about spell prices that melees set, when casters sell of melee items at stupid prices, and vice versa. Spells are part of your equipment, and are the same as a tanks armour and weapons. <br>

Whether a person has given you equipment or not is also irrelevant, this is not about Gingerr.  Every body has handed out equipment (assuming) at one time or another.  I practically handed a full set of armour to a passing newbie once I changed my equipment around in one day. <br>

One phrase:  <br>

&quot;Your a buffer, STFU and buff&quot;. <br>

Chanters / Clerics dont charge $$ if they are in your group...<br>
<br>
I have had to pay for melee help tons of times to help me camp something or drag my corpse or help me tank something all the time...<br>
<br>
if the melee person is not in the group then u do have to pay for their time...<br>
<br>
i have never met a chanter that ask for donations for C3 when they are in the group and i never ask for extra items / pp for casting group aego even thought i'm exttremly poor from it now...<br>
<br>
i never charge ppl for aego / rez ever unless i really need it when i'm 0pp in the bank and have no peridots...<br>
<br>
just pointing out that your point isnt the same...<br>
<br>
and people spend time farming all the time for pp...selling C3 / aego in nexus is the same thing so ppl should just STFU about how others want to play or say...<br>
<br>
just /ignore them if it bothers you that much...cause without them then tons of druids / wizzies would be out of luck when they need those people to C3 when they are quad kiting...and i have been in some groups where casters gate to nexus for C3 and run back all the time..<br>
