What happened Raalf was eq discovered they had made a zone with a bunch of utterly pansy blue cons and decided to fix it.  *Gasp* the horror of actually fighting something that presents some sort of challenge! <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46578"> Salta </a>

Quad kiting is what makes wizards exciting if I wanted groups I would still be a paladin.<br>

This is probably a temp fix to prevent more expoitation.. <br>

well, maybe next time when a wizard is sitting LFG at a zone for 2 hours you know how it feels. <br>

Does it feel nice when a caster can do something with all his potential and all u can do is sit and watch with jealousy..<br>

<br>
- Made several gameplay changes to The Grey. A single group having the ability to simultaneously engage and prevail against 35+ experience-giving creatures is not in line with the desire for risk vs. reward and the promotion of balanced groups. <br>
<br>
Clearly the patch message stats that the ability of A SINGLE GROUP killing 35 mobs at once was what tipped verant off that they had screwed up.  Nowhere does the patch message state that they did it due to melee's whining about a wizzie quadding, nor does it even mention wizzies at all.  If you honestly think the brilliant customer service of eq could log complaints and petitions about one single zone made by a bunch of jealous melee chars and take action on them in under a week you have got to be one of the most ignorant players in the game.  You actually think that a melee would complain about a zone with a bunch of blues that barely hit in the 100's? There's definitely something wrong when the melee group (not an ae group) that I was in could kill 12-16 mobs at once w/ half the mobs being unmezzable. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46578"> Salta </a>

I'll echo a friend's sentiments. I don't have a problem with casters solo'ing, or anyone for that matter. I could solo my ranger up to 40 in Stonebrunt if I wanted to and had the time. What Verant won't stand for is a group structure that veers away from the warrior/cleric/enchanter holy trinity, no matter how slight. They way they &quot;nerfed&quot; the zone proves it.<br>
<br>

Whether it was quadding, AEing, or just regular grouping the zone was great.  There was plenty of room to root mobs for crowd control and things didn't beat on my tanks so badly that I wasn't able to keep up with the heals.<br>
<br>
Verant is a little shaky with their wording though.  At first, Absor was saying that 50-60+ mobs were being killed at a time.  Then it went down to 35+.  Who knows?  I think what most people were angry with was the fact that they made the monsters there HIGHLY resistant to everything.  <br>
<br>
Now, they say that they've lowered the resistance a bit.  I was there today with a group and it wasn't nearly as bad as before -- if you had a lvl 60 pulling singles or a monk trying to split pull (which doesn't work so well there sometimes).  But if you get more than one and don't have an enchanter, you're gonna get mad little monsters on your healer when he/she tries to heal the party.  <br>
<br>
I managed to root a couple of times and snare a few times, but resists are still way too high in my opinion.  My epic was pretty much useless.  We were there maybe two hours and I can't say it was as fun as Charisis or Chardok.  In fact, I'm not sure I see a reason to visit that zone unless I'm passing through to go to the temple.  <br>
<br>
Who knows?  I could eat my words tomorrow when they patch <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We'll have to see.  My only wish is that Verant would lighten up on their hard handedness about some situations.  They should think a bit before reacting, not vice versa.  It only tends to piss players off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Krup Knight</span><br>  Posts: 245<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/13/01 3:49:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: bitchy meele got jealous</span><hr size=1> <br>
actually melee's could solo in that zone efficently.. <br>
<br>
The nerf was generally for AE groups but it did way more than it was intended..<br>
<br>
Mobs are pretty much un quadable since they will resist snare and roots constantly and and resist partially or fully nukes more than half the time.. and those nice golems running around virtually resistant to everything don't help.. <br>
<br>
Even full groups are having trouble since most mobs arent mezzable and those golems mean certain death<br>
<br>
Personally I perfer quading/soloing over grouping.. why? Cause the exp gained is noticible and I can do things during the downtime and its a challenge.. 1-4 mobs against one person where one mistake means an end.. Compared to grouping where you can pull 4 mobs and mez no or little risk<br>
<br>
hopefully people will provide positive feedback to make the zone useful again.<br>
<br>
As for AE spells.. AE spells are the wizard's bread and butter as someone put it on Graffe's messageboard.. They should have a use somewhere <p><center>

<br>
With the prevalence of 49+ rezzers in the game, the risk is really quite minimal. If any of those in the PBAOE group had a Cleric at least 49+ on another account or if there was one fighting in the zone, the rewards are MUCH higher than the risks in my opinion. <p><HR>
