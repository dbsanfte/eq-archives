We invited boldog, Darker, and Daern to help us. <br>
<br>
We were sucessful in the kill, but several things erupted which have resulted in my desision as a guild leader of Anarchy Contained to remove several names from my roster.<br>
<br>
The map of Iceclad piece number 4 was rolled on. Daern wont he roll.  Canib both in guild channel and in the pickup raid channel continuously told Waelon to loot the map piece.  Waelon questioned Canib and I even told Waelon not to loot the map piece , but Waelon looted the piece anyhow.  <br>
<br>
The decision was made to camp lodizal and give Daern a shell which he opted to get instead of a map piece in order to restore the guild's honor.<br>
<br>
  <br>
On Tuesday, June 18th<br>
<br>
Sendole questioned this decision that was made by both I and Canib and started causing a guild disruption.   On top of this I learned that parts other than the shell were being defaulted.<br>
<br>
<br>
On top of this I learned that several members have left not only due to this whole mess but due to Gnibblet and Bumeden's heckling of members.    <br>
<br>
I have tired of this mess.<br>
<br>
Canib, Waelon, Gnibblet, Bumeden, and Sendole are herby being REMOVED from Anarchy Contained.<br>
<br>
Gnibblet, if you were intending to get Dark Side restarted you will NOT be doing it with my guild members.<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
It is no longer the policy of Anarchy Contained to default items on pickup raids.. any raid that is run by our guild that contains non members is considered a pickup raid. <br>
<br>
Our charter states clearly that anyone caught ninja looting, stealing, giving our guild a bad name, or trying to cause a disruption in order to make us loose members will be forthwith guildremoved and talked about on this forum.<br>

Sorry to hear about your unfortunate experience with this fools.  Just had friends acct hacked and used for bad purpose myself, so kinda know the feeling.  <br>
<br>
Wasn't the Guild 'Dark Side' - leader was some Beett or Beetto (somethin like that..rogue) that ninja'd the dain's head from VM few months back?  Just rung a bell when you mentioned that guild name...<br>
<br>
He was a pain, just wondering with all these new name changes could G$%^$# be same person if the guild 'Dark Side' is the same.<br>

Waelon has apologized to Daern and inside guild chat.. he will be apologizing on our guild forum and will be apologizing here.<br>
If he screws up again for not paying attention  or anything else.. he will be out and flamed WORSE than he got flamed this time.... these are the terms of his second chance.<br>
<br>
The other people WILL NOT return under any circumstance.<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
Our guild was created on the grounds that we would FORCE fair loot rules onto raids and the such.. aka if an item is all all and has haste on it  then anyone.. I dont care what class they are.. they can roll for it.. Noone has the right to tell anyone how to play their class.. and It is our goal to abolish the sentiment that people with 175 melee skill should not be allowed to use it.   Given the words &quot;fair loot practices&quot; and the behavior of the afore mentioned, they have earned themselves a huge punitive action.<br>

Ash, so you didn't boot Waelon out? A shame. That guy's a detriment to the server. I have had numerous dealings with him, and he's one of only 3 people on my no-rez/port/group list, mostly for being extremely childish. I would be very suspicious of his &quot;not paying attention&quot;, or whatever excuse he used.<br>

<br>
I joined the guild,. and as soon as i did i was asked if would hold Lodi.  I said Sure. i have now been there for over 5 lodizal spawns. Do the math on that one, Oh just in case your adding is as good as your judgment it is 90  hrs.  I would have had my 6 th but you done a good job screwing all that up. I will never regret doing this because your a &quot;Stupid B*T(H&quot;!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Now this is your test you say, I'm a &quot;click&quot;,. and i say your a stupid b*t(h, now we are even on name calling.  If you wish to make up for what you can't funking prove, you will take the time to get back with me because I'm not wasting any more of my time on you.<br>
<br>
 I don't know Sindol from any where else but in the guild, you called him &quot;childish&quot;.  Look who is being the little child.  Oh well  it must be contagious because I'm being a little Childish also, it helps me out when I'm mad, and get classified by a fucktard like you when all i have done is help out the guild while act is away. (heh oh yea fucktard like that it was a typo but it sounds nice hehe).<br>
<br>
Sorry for all the people who have waisted there time reading this except for ASH=@$$.<br>
<br>
To all that have read this Ash has showed no respect to me.  Wait except when she was at Lodi... hint, hint, hint.<br>
<br>
I mean I've been nice to even so called &quot;/who son of a bitch&quot; (sorry add it is funny and makes ppl laugh :P) At Death's Door,<br>
when they where holding storm in IC when  my guildies were going be dicks just for SH-IT and giggles.<br>
<br>
Plus Ash Ironman removed 4 of his Chars. from the guild because of U. Looks like your doing a good enough of a breaking up act guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well everyone i think my fair share of words have been said. Now I need all my friends to let ash know that I'm not a part of a so called &quot;click&quot; and that i respect my friends/guild members at all times (not when it is just convient).<br>
I have been friends with a lot of people and now it is time for me to call the favor and for yuns (yuns inside joke), to stand up for me.<br>
<br>
Because unlike U ash i know i need my friends around.<br>
<br>
LaterZ, Canib Sloan<br>
<br>
I was looking at some of the pics' U guys have mad and they look nice, good job guys, even joo ash, Note if i hadn't been holding Lodi i might get the time to make on.  Oh wait I have time now. muhahahah.<br>

After all, most native english speaking people don't use and/or understand half the rules and fine nuances in the language. Picking it up as a second language is by far the most difficult language to learn.<br>

Once more,  the apology and don't screw up again thing is in effect. <br>
I talked to your brother for nearly half an hour aobut this mess and he told me that he will talk to you about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
But for the record, Canib.. <br>
<br>
Sendole, Hassel, and Bumeden are the same person from what I have gathered.. so in truth we are only loosing one person among those 3 characters.   We have not lost half our guild from this thing.. in fact we are gaining more members as a result of the remainder of the guild's obvious integrity. <br>
 I would like to see you and Waelon restore your honor in the face of others.. apologies are just the beginning... <br>
 Future actions will speak strongly.<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
Also, I am sorry that Bumadan has to contend with someone having a name similar to his, who has such a severe character flaw.   I know it is rough... People have kept asking me if I am a ranger and talking to me as a male because of a character in another game. <br>
