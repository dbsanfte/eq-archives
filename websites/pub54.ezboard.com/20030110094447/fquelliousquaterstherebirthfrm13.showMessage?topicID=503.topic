<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   <br>

------------------------------ <br>
<br>
<br>
** Experience Balancing ** <br>
<br>
The combination of the NPC experience changes and the post-50 &quot;penalty level&quot; rebalancing at once had a stronger effect than we anticipated. <br>
<br>
<br>
We've altered a few of the changes to more accurately reflect our intent. <br>
<br>
- The intent is to promote grouping, not to inflict a harsh nerf on our more casual players who frequently do not have the time to invest in finding and forming a group. <br>
<br>
- However, we do not believe that going solo should be the single most optimal way to gain experience in EverQuest, which is what it had become prior to these changes. <br>
<br>
<br>
That said, we'd like to take a moment and explain what happened. <br>
<br>
<br>
On &quot;Penalty Level&quot; Rebalancing (Levels 51, 54, and 59): <br>
<br>
- Many people saw much smaller experience gains at level 60. This was due to the &quot;penalty level&quot; rebalancing effect more than anything that was done to NPC experience values. <br>
<br>
- In the previous patch, Level 60 became a full level, when it had been half a half level the day before. <br>
<br>
- &quot;Penalty levels&quot; have once again been rebalanced such that level 60 is much closer to the half level that it was before, and experience was instead redistributed throughout the earlier levels. <br>
<br>
- The penalty effect is still mostly mitigated, however the distribution should be more fair to those who are already level 60, yet do not have a full bar in that level. <br>
<br>
<br>
On Grouping and Soloing: <br>
<br>
- From the point of view of a level 60 character, a steady stream of level 45 NPCs represented the single best advancement in EverQuest, when the score is kept in &quot;Experience Per Hour.&quot; <br>
<br>
- With the advent of Luclin Alternate Abilities, nearly every sufficiently advanced level 60 could eventually and easily solo these &quot;optimal&quot; NPCs, and benefit more than they could in any type of grouping. <br>
<br>
- We understand that forming a group, travelling to your destination, and other inconveniences have an effect on progression. <br>
<br>
- With that in mind, we've undone the penalties for killing low blue NPCs, and instead added an additional group bonus to those who fight NPCs that are reasonably close to the group's level. <br>
<br>
- The idea is that people should be willing to take risks, fighting the hardest NPCs that they possibly can, to reap the best rewards in EverQuest, as opposed to the blue NPCs that represent the lowest risk. <br>
<br>
- For both groups and soloists, we strongly recommend trying out harder overall zones and the more difficult areas of zones that you might already be used to. <br>
<br>
- We're confident that you're going to find that the additional risk pays off *extremely* well. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
** Resistance Balancing ** <br>
<br>
Resistances have been altered in PvP to bring the game back into more of a balance. Please do remember, however; In both PvP and PvE, resist gear above 100 will still remain important. We thank you for your feedback. Please do continue let us know how the next round feels on a larger scale. <br>

Just look at the list and its 45+ people and add to that the arguments that everyone tossed out that not everyone knew abou it. IF as some were claiming not even 5% of the server reads this or the other board that amounts to alot of clerics waiting for rage. I bet likem many of their changes will open the gates and then pinch it off in a few weeks once the pressure is down and PoP comes out.<br>

<br>
Yeah, the list of clerics who were waiting are now taking advantage of it as soon as possible. Mostly because they worry that it may be too good to be true and will be nerfed soon. <br>
<br>
I think everyone needs to keep an eye open, the true reason they're allowing it is because of the impending waves of death Planes of Power will bring! BE WARNED!!<br>

The bonus you got for high blues was barely noticeable. If killing high blues was made as efficient as low blues were before no one could have complained.<br>
<br>
Also.<br>
<br>
The zones are mostly not DESIGNED to hunt high blues. Designers made things with the old system in mind.. even places like CT is not all high blues to a 60 group.. so great even if they did makle the high blue bonus good enough.. where would you hunt?<br>
<br>
I don't disagree with the intent but the execution was pure idiocy.<br>
<br>
IMO they need to up the xp for high level mobs and ALSO have a way to divide it amongst more than six people. So moni raids are a viable xp alternative to xp grinding.<br>
<br>
As it is now we always tell people 'raids are not about xp!&quot; so it's not unreasonable for people want to get the most efficient xp possible when they are grinding.. because unless they are a high dmg class they won't get any when raiding.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see them work on this some more, and I like what they were trying to do.. but the way they did it was retarded.<br>

<br>
The cleric epic change.....leave that alone. I like it as does everyone else who doesn't have the time to camp with your guild clerics for 1 week 24/7 to get it. I respect those who could do this in the past but bottom line is the cleric epic is essential on raids and if you didnt get it way back when, you most likely would never see it, for the avg player that is. Our guild before this patch had 1 epic cleric who got theirs prior to the Skyfire change. Since the patch we have another epic in the guild and are 1 fragment from a 3rd. These clerics who are now finishing their epics have earned it with waiting so damn long for VI to fix a clearly broken bottleneck. <br>
<br>
I am damn happy for clerics everywhere!<br>
<br>
If there is one class who has paid their dues it has to be clerics as far as an epic is concerned. Good job VI on this change <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.championsinarms.com/hall/uploaded/Bamana%20DeMoro/BOX%20SMALL.jpg" width=200 height=250> <br>

Verant doesnt want every cleric to have an epic or atleast thats what they said.. I'm all for making it less competitive but not to remove the competition..  Epics have been around for a while so maybe its time to make them all easier as they are really no longer status symbols and more useful tools.. <p><center>

Now THAT is a bitch. The Mage and SK epics are universally regarded as the worst, as the rogue being the easiest, but most people overlook the chanter epic. I played a chanter until last week and that epic drove me nuts. Made me nostalgic for the druid epic.<br>
<br>
And while some may feel the new cleric epic is unloading a ton of epics in the game, remember this is the tail end. All those clerics went through a lot to get there. The King in Chardok is NOT easy. All the Skyfire change is doing is helping clear the backlog of people who have been through the Queen, Ixiblat, and the so on and have been waiting an interminable amount of time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugalianaelessedil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galiana Elessedil</A> at: 9/7/02 6:04:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uqutsemnie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Krup Knight</span><br>  Posts: 225<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/7/02 6:33:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=503.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: They have lost their flipping minds</span><hr size=1> the king in chardok is stunable. hes a joke.  i thought we had them down as he was sort of automatic if he came alone. a tough fight we would win if he came with all his guards.  but then i went as doorman with another guild. They were less then our average level so i wasnt expecting much. they split his ass out to the raised area to the left of the way you came in from the library.  then chain stunned him!  im thinking to myself &quot;why dont we chain stun him?&quot; i learn something every day. officially making him a gimp two group of archetype titled 60s encounter easily.  hardly &quot;hard&quot;.  in fact i would venture that no stunnable mob can be called &quot;hard&quot;<br>
<br>
PS because the king is stunnable you could actually bring 2 ae groups and do him that way...  no really just train the whole room up to you and do the normal raid level 2 AE group thing.  i would venture any mob that you can ae group to death is hardly hard too.<br>

For the enchanter epic, you either have to be incredibly lucky, or have a second account with a plane-capable FD character to watch for a stupid mob that is rare, despawns if cazic spawns, and can get killed if it gets aggroed by another mob.<br>
