<br>
Now my responses to people flaming ADD. If you weren't there, you don't know. Perception is a key issue here. Does the bad guy know he is the bad guy, or just fighting for what he believes? Well, let me tell you what I believe ( me being the main bad guy, since the epic piece was for me )<br>
<br>
I believe banelion. A very good person, I believe him 100 percent that he attempted to negotiate. I believe we waited for the negotiations to determine how to proceed.<br>
I believe that, in the greater picture, we were not wrong for moving into fear.<br>
<br>
I joined radiant and friends on a fear clearing, after the fact, to help tide things over, and show that ADD are not bad people. I am the one making the decision to give the head of the serpent over to maeve, even though I have the full backing of my guild &lt; whom all support me in this, despite their individual personal views on the issue &gt;. A few things did bother me about some of the flame posts about ADD. I know we have a bad rep, however we do not deserve the baby killer logo or a scarlet letter stamped on our foreheads. EVERYONE in this game has made someone mad, every last one of you who have touched EQ. Should you point fingers?<br>
In my attempt for peace, while visiting the fear raid radiant had going I made note of a few things. Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't spying, but in light of some of your comments, I feel these things stand out.<br>
Allissiya, I am going to use your post, since you are at the end of the list and frankly the only one I can even remotely remember at this late hour.<br>
<br>
On the day in question, I checked to see if the shissar was up as soon as I logged in. It was not. I went about the usual order of things after, grouping with friends and such, when verbo &lt; as his alter &gt; informed the guild that the shissar had popped. I was at the fear portal 5-10 min. later. This was early in the morning, and I tried to setup a raid from all the friends I had online at the time. I didn't have enough of the right classes for a clearing, so I sat there as the drybones danced at the portal thinking how to proceed. My likely course was to wait until more ADD logged on. Then radiant moved into the zone. Not many, but a few. But then they went in. This was a bit puzzling to me, why they would go in with so few. The answer? They knew I was there waiting on the Shissar. My guild knew right away that they were there because I told them. They entered the dangerous zone to get a drop on us. I do not blame them for that, I would have done the same, had I wanted to risk my friends exp bars over getting to a camp for me in time. I did not want to risk it. Not my friends, not anyones.<br>
<br>
Radiant, on the raid I joined, had quite a few in the zone. Why did they not only have 10 or 15 in zone like they did before? I don't know, you have to ask them. I bet they would say it was to clear fear so the shissar would be easier to get. So why rush in it the day before?<br>
That supports my thoughts that they wanted to get in to &quot; claim &quot; the spawn.<br>
<br>
So, they knew we were there. We knew they were there. What happens next? A race. I think most guilds would have raced to it, had they heard me over guild chat nagging play by play, even just to shut me up. So there you have it, two guilds running to the finish line.<br>
<br>
To those of you who say we should not have been in a zone that they had cleared attempting to take their spawn, I have this to say: How much of fear could have been cleared by a force of not even twenty in a small time of two hours including a few wipe outs? With rez time included?<br>
<br>
Don't act like they had everything killed BUT the temple people. That wasn't anywhere near accurate. If the zone had been decently cleared, we wouldn't have had to engage the 8-14 mobs as we entered. Nor would we have had to pull twice to clear a path to the temple. THE ZONE WAS NOT CLEARED. A few mobs were, no doubt, but not enough for you preachers out there to call us evil for entering the zone that they worked so hard to clear to KS a mob that had not been engaged.<br>
********** still a race *******************<br>
<br>
I also believe verbo when he says he singled the shissar. you call me naive? I also saw him ( with my own eyes ) single pull inny out of his spot in hate. He singled a god, so yes, I 100 percent back his call that he singled the shissar. I wasn't in the temple with him, but if he told me he could pull a rabbit from CT's toenail, then you damn skippy I would believe him. I am not ignorant, I just believe any friend that has pulled me out of danger and risked his exp bar many times to save my butt.<br>
/salute verbo<br>
/kneel verbo<br>
<br>
So now let me tell you about a fact &lt; not something I am taking on faith, or by word of mouth &gt;.<br>
<br>
Tristadorn DID train us. 100 percent fact. I watched him as he did it, thinking he was an ADD member who had gone off the deep end running around fear like an idiot. I targeted him, and after saw who he was, prepared for what I knew was coming. I mezzed many mobs that he had incoming to our camp, but even though I believe I am a good mezzer, there were just too many. Do two wrongs make a right? In judgement, officers may err, but a leader should never act as he did. I respect Radiant, but I could live on a server without you trist. You killed my friends.<br>
<br>
So why am I giving the shissar to Maeve? I have more info than most of you because I requested it from verant. They say mob is ours. Radiant was in zone with enough to attempt the shissar, but they didn't get a chance. That is why I am giving it to maeve. If she were a bad person, I may not have. Most of us chanters tend to know one another, by way of reputation or hearsay from friends. I have heard of maeve, and I know she is a nice deserving person. It did help my decision. I am certainly not doing it because I am losing sleep ( that cracks me up Kroud ) because the only thing we even remotely did wrong, was not let them have first shot. <br>
To you flamers, put that on me in the first place. I was the one who wanted it that bad.<br>
<br>
So, in summary:<br>
/salute Radiant<br>
/rude tristadorn<br>
<br>
/respect-and-love ADD, to all those that back me, back each other, and work as a team.<br>
<br>
/watchyourback to those who would harm my friends, whatever tag they wear above their heads.<br>
