Actually mana is more comparable to a warriors stamina bar, but even that is meaningless now.  When warriors used to have to sit to regain stamina..that might be comparable.<br>

Why don't you get a group together and try it?  It's already been shown you can do it.  With dragons being solo'd by shamans and SK's now....It's just mind boggling how a group of wizards can do it.<br>
<br>
And no effort? I think it takes about the same effort as vis or lotus puts into these dragons.  It's friggen trivial lol<br>

Lol, It would be fun to watch 5 ogres bash gore down at the same time.  The big question would be, can they all count to three? or would half of them get stuck on two and the group would get owned.... <br>

<br>
WW Dragons - loads of em, no one particularly NEEDS them (unless its for a specific purpose).<br>
<br>
Reavers - Repop every what? hour ? sure they are 100% MR - but some mobs are 100% MR.  You say they are the same, but they are numerous. X pop before Ghiosk does, there are 3-4 upstairs near Rek and a couple near Nek.  How can these possibly be put in the same league as mobs that pop randomly (1-2 times per week) which stuff that guilds not approached post epic encounters still need.  <br>
<br>
Warriors lose defensive - let me tell ya something about warriors ... an average warrior (not someone with totally loads of gear) can have a compariable AC with a Paladin, as well as HPs.  (I have around the same hps as my friend, Banelion and I have Cobalt BP, couple of pieces of SS and rest Warlord as well as epic) <br>
<br>
We do not get a heal, we dont get a fantastic taunt apart from the basic one (whereas SKs, Rangers, Pallys) get an awesome amount of taunt powers.  <br>
<br>
We dont inflict a large amount of damage, so what sets us apart from the rest? Defensive, nothing more, nothing less.<br>
<br>
Warriors were/are/will be nothing without a cleric behind them, which we are TOTALLY reliant upon.  Whilst the other classes have been massively upgraded, warriors have remained the same.  <br>
<br>
I feel that their position in Norrath is fine, we do nothing exceptional except take damage.  <br>
<br>
However, this does not take it away from the fact that warriors do have to tank, but in some occasions - a Paladin/SK or as an outside chance - Ranger will do..<br>
<br>
I laugh when I hear the day when 4 warriors can take down anything substantial - even Ragefire (about Naggy strength) even with the best weapons, the best equipment - we would all die.  <br>
<br>
On the wizards v Kunark Dragons thing, sorry guys you are STILL defending your corner.  <br>
<br>
I re-iterate its a question, not an accusation as to why 4 wizards can take out a Kunark dragon which maybe 80% of the server can make use of.  <br>
<br>
A couple of wizards have admitted that it is open for abuse - and it will.  <br>
<br>
I know people have said that well why break what isn't broken.  This is part of forward planning and organising ahead of time.<br>

<br>
No @#%$?<br>
<br>
You still havent addressed the facts other then restating &quot;I think it's overpowered&quot;,  but did go into a nice spill about warriors capabilities.<br>
<br>
Damn straight Warriors are defensive and take damage.  They take lots of damage too.  And their level 60 taunt is a must.  Thank god for warriors!! <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> we dont get a fantastic taunt apart from the basic one (whereas SKs, Rangers, Pallys) get an awesome amount of taunt powers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think you greatly underestimate the power of level 60 warrior taunt.  As a wizard, It's my job to stay number 2 on the hate list so I know which classes can really taunt really good and which can not.  On big mobs, ie, level 65+ a level 60 warrior can let me do a lot more damage faster without getting eaten.  In fact, It's VERY noticeble.<br>
<br>
Uber mobs take lots of warriors and defensive to even have a shot at them.  Kunark dragons don't because they are trivial.  In fact, most kunark dragon fights are just a 45 second zerg fight anyways...but I'm sure you know that =p<br>
<br>
In fact, do you even have a clue to how valuable 'Defensive' is?<br>
<br>
Reavers? lol, I'm not sure who brought up Reavers but they aren't even nearing the same class as Kunark dragons.  In fact, there are frogs in seb that are tougher then Reavers.  Hell, we've had lower level rangers offtank Reavers with no problems...I'm sure I even had at some point.<br>
<br>
So yep, I'll agree with you there Raluvin.  The only thing I don't understand is how often people dont bring wizards to Reaver fights.  100% MR sure... but not even close against Lures.  Oh well, more exp for me =p<br>
<br>
So, if you want to defend your &quot;MB is overpowering&quot; arguement.  Take a look at what we have told you, and show us how we are wrong.  Not just restate that you think it's overpowering.  <br>
<br>
I won't restate what these points are as you can just look back through the posts.  But until you actually argue these points and show that we are wrong then...<br>

<br>
My discussion is based on the fact:<br>
<br>
WHY should 4 wizards kill:<br>
<br>
what 10(uber people)<br>
15(semi-uber people)<br>
20(less than semi uber)<br>
25+ 55-60s....sorry this is to be politically correct for people<br>
<br>
In KUNARK/some SoV <br>
<br>
This is not class balancing.  It should at least take an equal amount of wizards in theory to kill a Kunark Dragon.  <br>
<br>
Sure there has to be a little flexbility for arguments sake, but under no circumstances should four wizards do what more than 2 1/2 times the amount of people can do.  <br>
<br>
So, Can anyone answer this question ? <br>
<br>
*****Why not nerf Manaburn against Kunark mobs*****<br>
<br>
When you reply think about other factors:  <br>
<br>
*  Will wizards abuse this power<br>
*  Should they be able to farm these items<br>
*  Will this cause further arguments in future<br>
*  They nerfed Naggy/Vox for post 52+, what was the reason for this? <br>
*  Do wizards get other benefits which are otherwise unavailable for other classes<br>
*  In this field are wizards balanced ? <br>
<br>
I am sure I have missed a few, but chew on a couple of those factors before ya post.  <br>
<br>
I do not believe MB is overpowered, I dont think it is - but I do believe it should be capped to be selective towards its targets.  <br>
<br>
Just a few bullet points of advantages and disadvantages of nerfing MB versus Kunark Dragons would be interesting.<br>
<br>
I re-state this is not anything personal against Wizards - its a mere question to provoke a discussion which it has done, although some people take this as a personal insult - Please do not take away my toy!!!!!, Ill fight tooth and nail for this toy<br>

Gore kill ( arguably the tougher of the kunark dragons )<br>
<br>
one group ( 6 ) uber wizards can kill - 4 if you happen to get a rare crit...laff.  It would be done with 5-6 ) 5 might be pushing it a bit. 5 x 6k = 30k damage... gore has more then that I believe.<br>
<br>
- I believe a wizard with manaburn would be considered uber<br>

one group ( 6 ) uber Holy trinity classes group can kill<br>

6 wizards - 6 holy trinity<br>

  Fact is even if ya got a full group of burners,@#%$ happens and there is like almost always a raid right behind em waiting for them to fail.And about the warriors not doing @#%$ for damage....thats BS,@#%$ they do more damage than pallys and SKs imo.A burn from a wizard with lets say full kael quest armor and no ntov or good +manna gear would be 6kish,yah 6k damage every 2 hours,not like it can be chain cast.Just my opinion.<br>

Manaburn IS overpowered, but not for the reasons you think.<br>
Killing kunark dragons? Bah, I, personally, could care less. <br>
<br>
Why it's overpowered is cause the max hate you can get from a mob for anything is 800 pts. (This isn't including taunts, they have no definate value.) Normally, every nuke a wizard does for 2k would get them around 800 pts, but they can do 8-16k (depending on crit or not) with manaburn, for VERY low aggro. <br>
<br>
Don't believe me? Have a warrior get aggro on a mob, and have a cleric cast a CH on him. After the CH, wizard can manaburn and then just stand there, with the mob barely blinking at them. Why?  CH = same amount of aggro as a MB, so if the cleric lives, the wizard will too. Sure, the wizard will be OOM, but with just 1 of the 3 charge mod rods, and epic, familiar, c3, bard song, POTG, etc etc, they'll have enough mana for normal nukes real fast. <p><center><img src="http://www.relinpor.com/sigs/zeiksig.jpg">
