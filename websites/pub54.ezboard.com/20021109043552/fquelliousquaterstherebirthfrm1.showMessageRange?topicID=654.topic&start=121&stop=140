<br>
When we felt it was time to drag Callandre to epic-dom, we went to set up camp in SF. When we got there, we found that Jeaanie was camping him, and as we don't fight over spawns or camps usually, we decided to wait until the next go around. When the call to arms came for us to go help Jeaanie out, we all dropped everything and after a disastrous beginning (somone engaged before the troops were mustered) Ragefire was killed. Another guild (someone please help me out here) who people assumed was going to KS and take the Rage drop actually made Jeaanie's epic possible. There was a squabble about the other loot but it really isn't important to this discussion.<br>
<br>
After all the excitement died down, our whole guild settled in for the camp, claiming it, waiting for anyone to challenge, and to deal with it honorably if possible. I think Gruffnoy was wandering around at that time, but with not one person there to support him (glad to see you got your epic Gruff <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) I am not sure if we started this process or if it had begun before, but we began simply by deciding that as a guild we would support our cleric in this endeavor. In the evenings we camped there, took shifts playing thru the nights. There was always many people there, except the wee hours, then just a group usually. <br>
<br>
Old friends came by, we hunted together, chatted, had a great time. I think this was where the Papaya Group was born <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Dahlea, a very dear friend of Calandre's spent nearly as much time there as we did. She did so because she wanted to support the effort we were making to keep a force in the zone to minimize the call to arms time. It was made up of people from many guilds at various times. <br>
<br>
When Rage popped, at around 11am PST, I was sleeping when the call came in. I logged on and within 10 minutes of Ragefire spawning, we had sufficient force amassed from all over the globe, from several guilds. This was because we had many people already there. As luck would have it, Gore had spawned in DL around the same time, so folks who may have come to challenge our claim were kept kinda busy and away from the rings hehe. <br>
<br>
We wanted to make everything as fair as possible for folks assisting, and also to avoid the scuffle that happened with the non cleric loot from the dragon, so that was handled first. Everything would be randomed. We had such a turnout, over 50 people who wanted to help, that we held off on engaging as long as we felt safe so that these people would get the chance to help us. For us it was a great bonding experience.<br>
<br>
After the dragon went down, rezzes and loot were handled, Dahlea took claim of the camp. She did as Callandre before her, and ooc'ed her claim, waiting for anyone to challenge, and had support there. I didn't go back more than twice because I was burned out from the week before, but I know that she did as we had done, and kept a guild force there, as well as friends to keep her company. <br>
<br>
My whole point in explaining how things kind of evolved is just to show why it worked. The show of a force there was important. A cleric there camping with a large show of support means a lot more than a cleric left to rot waiting for the damn human to spawn. I am glad that it has been kept alive, and yes, it does seem to be getting a bit skewed if people take the so called list too seriously. As has been so aptly stated in the previous pages, the order doesn't matter so much, it is the amount of time you put in, and it is between the clerics who are there to decide who might take priority the next go around. <br>
<br>
That being said, I need to comment on what Feadorn (sp?) has posted. I am a proponent of the current way the camp is being handled, no doubt of that, but if for some reason, the clerics there are not being given enough support as to have a reasonable number of people there already, thereby slowing the gathering of forces, then anyone is within their rights to bring in their own force and take care of the job. Yes, there should be a reasonable time frame, and it is up to those &quot;latecomers&quot; whether they wish to assist the current cleric or not. However, if this system is being observed as it began, getting the forces required to take down the dragon into the zone within several minutes shouldn't even be an issue, thereby rendering the point moot.<br>
<br>
To Salta, in my reference to getting your guild involved more in the support of your cleric, previous comments made me think that there was yet again a cleric left alone to claim the camp, something contrary to the effort currently being made, but that point was cleared up as erroneous for the most part, my apologies for any offense. I think it is great that so many of the larger guilds are helping out and I am sure that whatever squabbles are here on the board will not be so present in game. I think that for the most part, the way this camp is being handled and shared in by so many from so many different guilds can be a healing experience for so many injustices, real and supposed, that have made their way across these boards the past year. <br>
<br>
Regardless of what people say against things here, if the players of Quellious are participating and making this WORK, then nothing anyone can say will change that.<br>

Bear in mind these are aimed at various people (and yet maybe at no one?) who are claiming &quot;As long as I play within the rules, everything is hunky dory. Neither honour nor integrity are familiar to me&quot;.<br>
<br>
(1) Where in any of Sony's Big Steaming Pile of Horse Manure (forthwith BSPHM) does it state that kiting a mob doesn't make it yours? As far as I was aware any form of aggro from the mob to you makes it your mob, and nothing an individual GM has ever said can override that rule. The BSPHM states this, so where's this &quot;understanding&quot; about kiting come from? Hell, does this mean that if I'm wandering around CS with 4 Wyverns being stupid enough to follow me while I &quot;kite&quot; them, that anyone is within their rights to take them from me? Even if I haven't cast a nuke yet, and I'm still at the stage of rounding 4 of them up with snare? Because if that happened you can be damn sure the first thing I'd do would be to swear in /gu, and the second would be a petition.. And becuase of the BSPHM, as far as I'm aware the person taking the mob would be in deep doodoo.<br>
<br>
(2) Who decides what &quot;sufficient force&quot; is comprised of? Someone brought up the idea of 10 people attacking Rage. Would that comprise &quot;sufficient force&quot; in most people's eyes, since there is a minimalistic chance that they might succeed? What about 10 MB Wizards? Even better.. What if a band of 10 people decided to kite it simultaneously? Would that be considered a free mob or a claimed mob, by your understanding?<br>
<br>
Again, in all of the above cases, as far as the BSPHM is concerned once aggro is achieved the mob <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> claimed, unless they've changed it since I last fell asleep reading it. So even the people who are trying to use the rules to justify their attitude with this mob are very likely ignoring/breaking those very rules to suit their argument..<br>
<br>
Again, Verant/Sony have repeatedly stated that the written ruleset on their website is the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only canonical ruleset by which all EQ players must abide</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Therefore anything an individual GM has told people about the concept of kiting not counting as ownership of the mob is, as far as I can see, so much felgercarb.<br>
<br>
*shrug*<br>
<br>
Anyways, as I said.. I and Dragons of Saint George are still supporting the &quot;list&quot; and the people on it, as we welcome ANY effort to increase comradeship and friendship on Quellious.<br>

My advice is for you to just go to SF and find out for yourself.<br>

I am sorry, but if my guild was not there with me, it would really bug me. And it also shows you what thier priorities are. I know, they can be there in 10-15 mins.

This game is all about people being sociable and helping each other and with this sort of camp you need all the help you can get especially if it spawns at a time when your own guild is asleep/in work.  I ask that all clerics regardless of guild honour this camp and build new friendships. The cleric you KS may one day be walking past your corpse after all.<br>

I solo'ed both around 46 or so (after I accidentally hit the combine button on a sewing kit...booooo).  To pull Begurgle, swim to the top of the tower, sit on the edge and look down at his spawn point.  When he pops, use dispel to pull him then swim out of range of the castle.  He'll follow ya...ALONE.<br>
<br>
The elemental...just root the elemental, fear the chick, nuke the piss out of the elemental, loot and zone.<br>
<br>
Gimblox...take yer time going to his spawn so you got plenty of mana (come in the back door past the merchant gobs).  Then just kill the 2 by the pit and park yer butt on Gim's spawn. <p><Br><img src="http://www.student.nvcc.vccs.edu/home/tlazaroff/CR.jpg" border="0">

While I understand the reasons for the list, you all know my feelings , but in the spirit of server harmony we shall try to give the list a shot.<br>
Feadorn said he would post later on the matter and I trust him to do so, so as it stands, ADD will use the list in hopes of not getting screwed over in any fashion.<br>
Should this happen then we shall see what comes of it. <br>

I applaud your judgement bro, leave it in the hands of the clerics to sort out between them.  <br>
<br>
As Ragefire is the most contested spawn and 90% of us work together to achieve as Quellious an amicable solution to an otherwise terrible situation which Verant has pushed upon us, I am glad to see that individuals and guilds alike do strive to at least have an element of understanding between them.  <br>
<br>
I knew nothing of the list from the outset and my instant reaction was what a pile of BS ... but after reading through how passionate people are about respecting other peoples camps, keeping them entertained and so on...<br>
<br>
....it reminds me of the time when me, you, Asky and Banelion were in Kaesora camping that dreaded key.  9 hours we were there and we received 3 keys.  The last key that dropped was between Asky and I and did we have a f'king argument over who was getting the key.  <br>
<br>
If you cast your mind back, it was the argument that you wouldn't expect .. I am having the key, NO I am having the key ... it was YOU take the key, NO!!!! You take the key - I will come back.  <br>
<br>
Finally I gave into Asky and looted the key, but I am sure he has his now! <br>
<br>
This is no different than that situation except the clerics are striving not to tread over one another.  <br>

We do have reservations about this list that have been stated in previous messages here.  If this system does break down at some point in time,  our guild will treat this camp as a FFA.  But until that time, we as a guild, will do whatever we can to ensure that it works.<br>
<br>
The clerics on the list will have my pager number and work number in order to get ahold of me at anytime they need.  My guild will also come and help the current cleric with Ragefire at anytime.  <br>
<br>
Our guild has been burned many times at this camp.  And its hard for us to trust others outside our guild when it comes to this camp.  And this is where some of our hesitancy comes from.  <br>
<br>
I am glad that this was on the General and not the flame board.  I think a lot more can be accomplished when we are able to discuss it without trying to defend ourselves from flames. <p><strong><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=158388">Feadorn Lifegiver</a></strong><br>

    The use of the term list might have been a poor choice at a time when so many here have seen how it could be seen as a reservation system. I see it as stated before a group of clerics and their firends working together. As with any group of people you get more when you put in more. My goal in this is to work at keeping on top of this spawn and when the bad boy pops have him dead within 30 min of his red robed arse setting foot in skyfire. We do this by having a team of people who watch and attimes kill stuff there, other time we coment about how the spinning ball needs to pick up the spice channel, or how wish someone could send us some dark elf strippers but I digress. Was I see to be fair is the one who puts in the most visible time there or has their firnds put in time, gets priority. Anyone is welcome to come to the daily cleric bar b q in skyfire and help out. More people we have to help out the faster he drops when he pops. Faster kills lead to faster spawns and more chances at spawns.<br>
    While I admit I have started paying rent to the minions of Veshan in skyfire and am doing alot of time there. I am keeping with what was posted earlier in this thread as the list, as long as those whose names are there show up and help, chat amd check in and let people know in game they still intrested. We even have a chat set up for the camp, but to be added to it you need to come and say hi, bring your cleric friends some cake and cookies or bring your dead buddy who dies in skyfire (has to be one of the best zones to die in cause right now can usualy find at least 3 clerics in zone at any given time). <br>
