Wraith disbanded for our own reasons, and most of it was burn out. Yours truly even tried to kick the EQ habit for a bit and was unsuccessful, and tried to let someone take the guild over. Had nothing to do with VM, nothing to do with LC, nothing to do with anyone else besides ourselves. Also, these raids you talk about us waiting days and hours just to get the mob to spawn. Damn where was I? I dont recall waiting for one mob at all, all I remember was racing to a mob. But since I guess you know so much better than I do, I guess that must be true. Other than that Im not here to bash VM or compare whos done what. Vm does their thing we do ours, LC does theirs. All ill say is the high end guilds are a hell alot more civil then what they were ever before. And no I dont claim to be a part of that either im not that level headed and cool tempered, I cause more waves than anything.<br>
<br>
As for old Wraith and new Wraith. Since you like to comment on that, I recall being called &quot;zergs&quot; in old wraith as well. And if all we do is throw warm bodies at certain mobs (because thats all we are is numbers and no skill right?)  explain how we succeed? I can name quite a few high end encounters that will punish you if all you do is zerg them. One of those encounters has also only been completed by us on this server.<br>
Old wraith had its share of great players to, hence Raging Fury on AB. Majority of them are there, and are one of the top guilds on the most crowded server in EQ. But New Wraith has far outdone what old Wraith did, and since i was at the start of both and I will be at the end of both im probably the most qualified to make that judgment. And against the popular opinion, both old and new have some pretty damn good players in it.<br>
<br>
As for guild leaders being a key part of a guild, it goes far deeper than that I assure you, good guild leaders are surrounded by good officers. Occy ran you guys into the ground in my opinion, keyword being &quot;opinion&quot; as I was not a part of VM and never will be. Occy and VM pulled some of those most manipulating and kniving things ive ever heard of to people on this server, and yes I was on the recieving end of some of them. Yea that got you to the top and kept ya there for a bit, and if your proud of gettin there the way you did more power to you. Does that mean Occy wasnt good at leading a guild? By no means, he set out to accomplish and he did, he did what he thought it took to win. He knew how to motivate his guild and thats a key part of winning.<br>
<br>
Whoever LisaW71 is, I guess you been living in a hole the past 8 or so months if you havent caught a drift of what weve done. If your meaning since we are allied with Revivisence and that discounts what weve done, guess thats your perrogative. Between both guilds we have fewer tagged people on raids than both VM and LC does. Adding works wonders when you know how to do it.  Yet we are called the Zergs, make sense to everyone but us, oh well doesnt bother me none the least other than a good laugh from time to time. I think alot of resentment towards Wraith/Rev comes from the rate we advanced at. Like we didnt pay our dues or some such. Anyway props to Darkoor and crew trying to get that keep guild kicking, youve lasted longer than I thought you would when things started heading downhill. ANd as for VM haters I think my and Kalsto are on the same level, tho I cant say that its VM I dislike anymore, being that majority of the assholes I disliked went to Explicit. But thats a whole nother story.<br>

Left ADD for it, didnt know what the hell was going on. Kalsto was playing his warrior at the time, forget it off hand. I recruited with Descent for, pfft god i dont know how long, 6 or 7 months, and then when they finally fell in May of 01 he formed that guild and invited me into it. i felt like he was doing me a favor or trying to apologise, all i remember is that we would farm CDok over and over again for his warrior, other warriors and cleric epic. then i remember he DBed us and said &quot;start groupin with wraith were merging&quot; and the rest was history i guess. Gael is right, for someone who has been off quellious along time now, his name still is brought up frequently. I agree with Galiana also, He wanted descent to rize to the top, and be where Vis is now but no one was really ready for that so he left. I dont know, there is alot i can say on this subject. but its better left alone, past is the past, the future is now. <br>

<br>
I meant that since he left the server.<br>
<br>
He disbanded the guild because VM beat us to Velketor on the next day after our first VP raid (big deal back then)<br>
<br>
I wasn't shocked then but now that you think of it.. How could he do that so fast?  It may not have been due to VM directly probably more likely that he was demanding way too much out of his members.. (made a ranger twink to avoid the guild when I wanted).  Its not a knock to him just stating the facts.<br>
<br>
Many guilds have risen and failed due to the race to catch up with VM and having their people burn out.<br>
<br>
Now Woow don't allow your ego to turn into an Arkinia.. Its not healthy. <p><center>

<br>
Lisa is Yoza Droz. <br>

I do remember you guys waiting at mobs Droz, as Woow said, but I do remember us waiting 6-8 hours at Dain and a couple other things as well. I showed up at like 10am, and fell asleep when it was actually time for Dain. I remember thinking wow, look at all our warriors, because we had like 10 Vis warriors show up that day, and until the Ntov days, that was unusual. (Back when Moho was our only war a raid or two) <br>
<br>
lol.. i dont recall, but I think that might have been the Dain that Occy played Buud for, and haha, i remember Occy saying something along the lines of &quot;omg this sucks. Ok everybody sit down in a circle in front of me, when I buff you, get up and go away from the group&quot; It was funny if you were there. :P<br>

His warrior's name was Tobrin, btw, and he ebayed one on SZ. Hell of a warrior, too, female inky loaded with gear. I think he plays her as much or more than his wiz.<br>

Dunno why the griping about farming Chardok, a lot of people came out with epics, it wasn't just for Kal. I was there when Dominick (another Antiquity alumnus) got his light sabers. All he needed was the Queen's blade to finish it.

<br>
Looking back, it was a nice roster that Kalsto had, all of them just werent near as uber as they are now. If only Dabo could see the main tank that Chunker became heh. I remember when I was new to Descent, everybody treated Dabo like he was the end-all god-tank.  I think Chunker was only 52 or so then, Chunker got invite about 1-2 weeks before me. And Faie and the other bard were both like 1 day before me. I remember Nida saying &quot;we had no bards, then next day 3&quot;<br>
<br>
Neat to see we had one member joined FoH and another joined Afterlife. <br>

<br>
Hence my comment that I often see Wraith/Revi as well as Lotus Cult with alot more numbers than what Vis Maior currently have.<br>
<br>
Nor once did I mention any &quot;Zergs&quot;, I was merely commenting on that it must be good to have &quot;another guild&quot; as well to have along, since as a matter of fact certain mobs do require alot of numbers. <br>

Our ethics have always been different and our views on who we guild are different.  <br>
<br>
Woow: <br>
<br>
I dont know about wraith but LC didnt and never has &quot;mass invited&quot; as you call it.  LC just never made raiding mandatory for its members.  We guilded people and being able to play every day wasnt one of our requirements.  Which led LC to have a large percentage of part-time players.<br>
<br>
I think thats a large part of why no one paid attention to what LC did.  No one thought we would be where we are now with 80 percent of our guild made up of part-timers.  The same fact also leads us to having 80 + on the popular mobs with stuff everyone wants (Emp, AHR, notv etc) and yet barely holding onto a raid with 40 - 50 and 4 clerics half 2-boxed (learning VT, Shei, Burrower) on not so popular raids.<br>
<br>
Whereas VM always had hardcore raiders.  Players who you could count on being there just about every day til 3 am.<br>
<br>
So much talk about 'zerging' is thrown all over the place and it gets tiring.  I dont think any of our guilds ever go to any raid intending to zerg it.  Though im sure all 3 of our guilds have been guilty of zerging a mob here and there when its at 5 percent life, no tanks left, and its starting to eat clerics.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chik:<br>
<br>
Tachibana still plays.  Last time grouped with him in FG he was unguilded.<br>
<br>
Tynan; havent seen in while since I grouped with him in velks like...almost a year ago.  He had been thinking about forming his own guild at the time.  Assumed he quit.<br>
<br>
Zanietta gave account to a friend.  Came on a couple times to say hi to friends but havent seen in like 8 - 10 months.<br>
<br>
Alancia still plays.  Both her and her monk Zhanata are in Reviv.  Though she is there with friends not to raid.<br>
<br>
Vilu sold.  Whoever has the account now had name changed with the new name change service.<br>
