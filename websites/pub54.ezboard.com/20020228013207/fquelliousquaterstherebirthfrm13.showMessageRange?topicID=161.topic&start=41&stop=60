There was also no real evidence of who planned 911 attack.  It was all &quot;he said she said&quot; at the begining.  But we did what we could do--suspect (and we didn't only have one suspect too! other later are proven non-related), which finally lead us to track down our enemy.  I am guessing, if those reporters can't give out evidence--they must be suspecting.  Which if it's not true, why shall we mind about it?<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you define torture? Being securely detained, and blindfolded?&quot;<br>
<br>
I believe there are written rules of how you should treat your prinsoner.<br>
<br>
&quot;do you think MAYBE the fact these guys revolt every chance they get may be a factor here?&quot;<br>

That's why we have to make sure we are not breaking the rule ourselves so they can get out easily. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugurunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurunt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/24/02 7:01:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bleeding Heart Liberal &lt;--- Someone Call a Cleric</span><hr size=1> <br>
Well, once the attacks happened we had a lot more info that the news could report... security issues, which is a nice grey area.<br>
<br>
I mean, if I rape a girl the cops aren't gonna broadcast 24/7 what evidence they have on me and exactly where they believe I am and when they expect to arrest me.  <br>
<br>
Hindsight, we were dead on who was behind it and where they were.  We didn't make a first move for a month, even tho we had our fingers pointed at and were requesting assistance from the Afgan govt.  <br>
<br>
&quot;with us or against us&quot; isn't 'fight with us or be attacked by us'.   If we have evidence of terrorists in a country, and that country doesn't take sides (ie, leaves the terrorists alone but doesn't &quot;support&quot; them), what are we supposed to do?  Forget about it?  <br>
<br>
War is a crappy solution.  It should always be the LAST solution.  Sometimes it's the only solution.  <br>
<br>
Bring up WWII again.  Can I assume you are against the allied powers aggression against germany... we bombed thier cities and took over their concentration camps and all... why?  were we justified in killing those germans and disrupting thier way of life so?   WWII was horrible, nobody wanted to be involved, we stayed out of it for so long partially because we didn't want to interfere with other soverienty and because we simply don't want to fight wars if there are other options.  But check your history books, Europe *tried* diplomacy for a good while with Nazi Germany, they even all but gave up a country (poland I believe) to them to avoid escalating conflict.  We were ready to sign a nonaggression treaty with Japan before they bombed pearl harbor.<br>
<br>
If someone is determined to kill you, you have two options.  Die, or kill him.  If you run he can chase you.  If you try to talk, sign papers, tell him you love him in spite of your differences, he'll still kill you.   Very few lethal conflicts are a result of 2 sides who both want to fight.   The concept of 'call the police' doesn't apply in international relations, there is no police.  The UN has no power to stop anyone, and with terrorists you don't even have a political body to be at odds with. <br>
<br>
The only &quot;good&quot; thing you could possibly walk away from in this situation we have is we hit the breaking point before those lunatics used a nuke or serious biological weapon.   The chances of it happening now vs a year ago are SIGNIFICANTLY reduced.<br>
<br>
The thing getting me about the prisoners now is it's not a basic checkup on us, it's a media circus... playing as if these assholes are the victims in all of this.  Now, if you wanna talk the hundreds of suspects that have been detained since 9/11 within the US, you got a big grey area... that is a very tough balance of civil rights and defense of life.  These POW's from afganistan are not.  They are the enemy, period.  They have shown a strong tendency and aptitude to revolt and kill while being detained as prisoners.  They are being treated a HELL of a lot better than they had treated their own people.  The US government isn't banning anyone from checking up on thier treatmetn, it's a total non issue.<br>

<br>
The Geneva Convention is supposed to guide militaries through wartime or conflict, although not all militaries abide, or even recognize it. Unnecessary cruelty, exchange of officers, what information you can give the enemy, denying medical attention to prisoners, and so on, are covered. <br>
<br>
If you are serving during a time of war/conflict and happen to be multilingual you may be asked to perform a soft interview. You speak with the prisoner, try to get answers, convince him it's in his best interest to talk. If he doesn't budge and depending on how badly they need information you will be asked to leave, and (more or less) civilians take over. The GC doesn't apply to organizations like the CIA. I doubt they tried talking again. Derived knowledge from a Gulf War vet. <br>
<br>
When I mentioned torture I was speaking in a general sense, not pointing the prisoners in Cuba out. IMO, and this is strictly my opinion, if CIA agents are on the premises torture in any degree is a possibility. KGB, what have you; they don't fly halfway across the word to accept a &quot;no.&quot; <br>

That's the mentality I'm calling to task. I honestly don't have enough information to know if these prisoners are being mistreated. I'm not saying they are. But in my book it is 100% ok for watchdog groups to check up on them, since I would imagine these particular prisoners run a much higher risk of being abused, given the nature of the 9-11 attacks. Turning our backs and saying it is ok to ignore the guidelines set forth in the Geneva convention because these are a particularly nasty set of prisoners just does not sit well with me. To me, it is one of those slippery slopes, where if you make exceptions, more are sure to follow. And no matter what, the *rules of war* are a good thing. In fact, since WWII is such a popular topic in this thread, I'm very surprised that the Japanese and German treatment of enemy prisoners has not been brought up. We put German and Japanese officials on trial for the horrible abuse that PoW's suffered under them, and rightly so. Where do we get off with the attitude that because we're America, or because these people are terrorists, there should be a special set of rules? I'm *not* saying the US is necesarrily doing anything nearly as horrifying as the Japanese or Germans did, but that we should not be so hypocritical. We have agreed to a set of standards, and there are checks like AI in place to make sure we abide by them, and if we *are* indeed abiding by them, then no harm, no foul right?<br>

The terrorists' advocates are insisting that they be accorded all rights given to prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention. Rumsfeld says that for the most part, they are being given those rights. Yet ironically, Geneva probably does not apply because these men are not prisoners of war, but battlefield terrorists, unlawful combatants who are attached to no sovereign nation and whose method of     fighting is below minimum civilized standards of modern warfare, if you'll excuse the oxymoron. But there is a point here. The Supreme Court has made clear that enemies who dress in civilian disguise in order to make themselves invisible among our civilian population for the purpose of killing people or destroying property are unlawful combatants, who may be tried by military tribunals. Also, such terrorists do not come within the scope of the Geneva Convention's long arm of protection.  <p>Crackanna Breeze<BR>

These *are* acts of violence aimed at killing large numbers of people and destroying property, two objectives warring bodies share.

The sentiment that worries me here is that some people are so all-fired concerned that the US is going to mistreat these jackals that the liberals are already screaming mistreatment.

The US Govt is dead terrified of looking mediapathic. They were forced to hood and shackle these terrorists because of the _numerous_ jailbreaks and riots that have been attempted, and the fact that they were being transported by PLANE. What happened the last time we had a wad of Al-Qaeda psychos on a large plane?<br>
<br>
C'mon people, give it a rest. You and I both know that the Govt is not stupid enough to go slapping these fools on the rack. The media, domestic and abroad, is watching gleefully for any sign of mistreatment so that it can scream about the injustice to the high heavens. Do you actually think that the media doesn't want every last shred of possibly damaging detail they can use on the current administration?

The Taliban took over Red Cross supplies shortly after the bombing started. I don't remember whether or not they killed civilians as well. Probably. I see them for what they are.

That pretty much sums up my point. It doesn't matter whether the Taliban treats civilians well or not, and it really has no bearing on how we treat prisoners. If we want to hold ourselves above the Taliban, then we shouldn't stoop to their level. <br>

Yup, we do honour it. The point I was making was not whether we honour or not, it was that while we didn't sign it, we do honour it.

Why is it that we hear screaming about these terrorists being &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; yet at the same turn you treat the govt as &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot;?

What, precisely, is different between smearing the campaign and calling us on our word? If they are calling us on our word without presenting evidence, isn't that just a textbook smear campaign?<br>
<br>
&quot;I find our trust in technology disturbing. We are the most advanced in those terms, but we're not rounded out. It wasn't enough to stop 9-11, and I hope they will train more spies and assassins. You can't escape the filth of it. Snipers can't go everywhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
This line, I must admit, confuses me. Why decry the US Govt for preconceived notions of human rights abuse and then propound on the need for assassins? <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

&quot;You admit that you think we'll honour it these lines, yet you are working towards raking the govt across the coals for _potential_ abuses. Pardon me?&quot;<br>

The whole fuss has been, to a degree, about AI making it their business to see the prisoners with an eye out for abuses. We usually don't care about AI monitoring other nations, but by God, they should have more sense than to question <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> our</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> good judgment.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why is it that we hear screaming about these terrorists being 'innocent until proven guilty' yet at the same turn you treat the govt as 'guilty until proven innocent'?&quot;<br>
<br>
I've written quite a few posts in this thread. I don't think I said I was certain we were crossing a line. I'm not a substitute for a reporter. I said abuse is a possibility in a case where a lot of people would like them killed on the spot, and therefore AI had good reason to &quot;butt in.&quot;<br>

As sickening as it sounds, there's nothing else as exciting to report until the next royal dies in a tragic accident. The longer it drags out, the more convoluted, the longer it will hold the public's interest. Destroying that potential works against them. They want a chance to say, &quot;I told you so! Don't trust anyone!&quot; pat themselves on the back and keep it going.<br>
<br>
&quot;This line, I must admit, confuses me. Why decry the US Govt for preconceived notions of human rights abuse and then propound on the need for assassins?&quot;<br>
<br>
Preconceived notions of abuse in this case or others? Call <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> me</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a cynic, but I've no doubt it's been practiced in the past. The present remains to be seen, and with all the focus on Cuba, I doubt it will happen.<br>
<br>
I should've done a better job of explaining myself with that paragraph. I think the entire ordeal could may have been avoided with one well-aimed bullet or trap. Clinton tried to make provisions to meet the threat but hell, that was impossible because he smeared a dress. Comments like Rumsfeld's disturb me. He and others think (or, perhaps, put on a public front) that future catastrophes can be thwarted with tighter security aided by technology. They keep leaving human intelligence out of the picture. I think it's unfair to promise security without facing the hole in it.<br>

My mistake. *bows*<br>
<br>
&quot;The whole fuss has been, to a degree, about AI making it their business to see the prisoners with an eye out for abuses. We usually don't care about AI monitoring other nations, but by God, they should have more sense than to question our good judgment.&quot;<br>
<br>
Agreed, though I have to agree with the final statement. I find it inane for AI to worry about the US when countries like the Sudan are experiencing the abuses that are so rampant there. While it is fine to say that we are bing held to a higher standard, there exists such a thing as Discretionary Enforcement in law enforcement (which is essentially what we are speaking of). This idea is that a Police Officer is better served prosecuting a murderer than he is stopping to catch a litterer. And this is the difference in scale that we are referencing here as well.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, we hold ourselves to this standard, but to have a stink made about the US when so many HR abuses are tacitly ignored sickens me.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clinton tried to make provisions to meet the threat but he smeared a dress&quot;<br>
<br>
You went and lost me again. Maybe I was not well informed, but my impression of the Clinton policy towards terrorism was pretty much to ignore it and hope it went away, comparatively.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think the entire ordeal could may have been avoided with one well-aimed bullet or trap.&quot;<br>
<br>
This I have trouble with. I have trouble reconciling a desire for the protection of human rights and support of assassination, and I feel that the idea of the use of assassination is a short-term tool used only by those with no care towards the long-term. While nothing prevents terrorists from attempting assassination aside from good security, a simple agreed-upon rule of espionage/warfare prevents civilized nations from using assassination as a tool. If we start sniping national enemies, we allow that sniping us is acceptable as well. This opens a brand-new kettle of fish. This sort of escalation is the last thing we need in the community of nations. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

<br>
Clinton was *not* a good model by any stretch of the term, but he did try to kill bin Laden around the time the WTC was targeted with an underground bomb and failed (again, too much emphasis on technology and smart bombs that aren't always so), and also tried and failed to pass a bill where Bush succeeded. Congress wouldn't pass the bill with Clinton in office. In all fairness, it *would* take something like a tragedy of this magnitude for legislatures to get up off their ass and put politics behind them. Not that I agree with the bill, but that's another story.<br>
<br>
&quot;This I have trouble with. I have trouble reconciling a desire for the protection of human rights and support of assassination, and I feel that the idea of the use of assassination is a short-term tool used only by those with no care towards the long-term.&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I don't. IMO assassination is justifiable if it prevents wholesale slaughter. We could discuss back and forth how X may not have come to pass, or Y may have turned out for the worse if Z was killed before events took place, but I've no doubt that persons like bin Laden would kill more people if they only had a chance.<br>

Do you have a reference to this? My understanding of the GC is that it doesn't encroach on government agencies. Else if it did, it may have never been signed. The CIA came under public fire 2 (or was it 3?) decades ago for such practices. Since then they've stopped profiling potential candidates, and now, it looks like we have a need for it.

Here we will have to diagree. No one can predict the future adequately enough to say with certainly that a pre-emptive assassination is a worthy thing. Even if we'd heard that Bin Laden  was planning this attack, we still would not have been able to justify whacking him. Stopping him, possibly arresting him (with cooperation of his host nation, yeah right), yes, assassinating, no.<br>

<br>
I should've written it as &quot;simple _Unwritten_ rule&quot;, as that was the case during much of the Cold War. We theoretically engaged in assassination of foreign nationals with Project Pheonix in Viet Nam. So far as I know, we've not done it since. Well, we've not been caught doing it, at least.<br>
<br>
One major point you've made a coupla times that I do whole-heartedly agree with is your call for more HUMINT. The lack of agents in the field is criminally negligent IMO. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

<br>
The USA made huge financial gain from WW1 and made a small contribution coming in at the end when her economy was threatened by Germany’s unrestricted use of Uboats (and after some ship sinkings that killed US citizens). <br>
<br>
As a European feel gratitude to the US for those men and women that gave up their lives to defeat the Nazis but I feel it equally for Russia who bore the brunt of the human cost that affected the outcome.<br>
<br>
In this war on terror (and in WW1/WW2) the USA acts purely out of self interest, just an observation not a critique.  If your leader(s) choose to pretend that this is being done for humanity in a selfless way then they are open to critisism on the treatment of the prisoners.  Since 11/9 (our format <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) the US has waged war on ‘terrorism’.  However it may surprise you that it has existed for decades and cost many more than 3000 lives.  For example 10,000’s have died in Algeria (around 100,00 at lastest count) to Islamic fundamentalism in the 80’s and 90’s.  Sadly it takes pain in the US for this to be headline news. <br>
<br>
Personaly from what I've seen the prisoners are treated fairly relative to what I’ve seen of US law enforcement. <br>
<br>
Anyway I’d like to think that my children will live free of the spectre of fear of terrorism.  However unlike many of my friends in the US, this is a threat I’ve had to live with daily for 15 years.  My office windows are bomb proofed, there are no dustbins in public places, there are road blocks around the offices, and from an early age I’ve learn about suspsect packages and about building evacuations.  However the people that are responsible for this are not Islamic and have been supported by US citizen for many years.  I work in London.<br>
<br>
The US is the first to complain if there’s any hint of a muscular response to our threat by my government (whatever your opinion on the rights and wrongs of that particular situation) so I can't unsderstand the sensitivity to being on the receiving end in this case.<br>

<br>
Actually, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're right? Yes, yes, we could really do with an all out land war with our closest sovereign neighbour, Eire.<br>
<br>
This would effectively trigger a scorched earth campaign the likes of which has never been seen, and probably end up with someone in a small house in Londonderry or somewhere triggering a dirty nuke. The Real IRA is a hydra. Shoot the ones you know about in the head and the next day the hundred that you don't know about blow up anything they can find as a target, and the more civilians involved the better. You wouldn't scare the ones left at all, because they'd know they'd be dead too if they'd been implicated.<br>
<br>
Way to go. Next bright idea? Anyone? Please, I love reading these trigger happy overnight solutions to this situation that I've had to live with for the whole of my twenty eight years on this earth. I live in a part of London that's been blown up twice in the last few years. If your policy were enforced, I'd have nowhere to shop for at least 6 months while they rebuilt it all again.
