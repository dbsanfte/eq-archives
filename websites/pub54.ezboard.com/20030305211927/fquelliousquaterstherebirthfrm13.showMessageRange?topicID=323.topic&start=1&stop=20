<br>
The topic:  Wizards and Manaburn<br>
<br>
First of all, before I get crucified - I am and always will be a wizard fan - I felt that they were underpowered before and I felt that Verant needed to do something about wizards.  <br>
<br>
But instead of putting icing on a cake, they have imo put icing, cherries, hundreds &amp; thousands, flakes and eaten the frigging cake by giving wizards MB.  <br>
<br>
I know that there are downsides, that the wizards run out of mana for 15 minutes and they can also use it only 2 hours apart.  <br>
<br>
But especially with the Kunark dragons, problems will arise with MB.  Sure only apply to single mob encounters with 6 MB wizards in Kunark ... but imagine the damage it will cause in the long run.  <br>
<br>
Scenario 1<br>
----------<br>
Talendor - 30 people buffing up ready for an attempt for a Red scale and some spells that are required.  Porting/Buffing could take anywhere from 20 mins to 1:30 even for the best guilds (people logging on etc etc).  <br>
<br>
One MB wizard ports over see's 30+ people in the zone.  Calls over 5 of his friends who are MB wizards .. Bang mob dead in 5 mins flat. <br>
<br>
GM called, arguments bleh bleh bleh.  But fact remains the 6 MB wizards engaged first.  <br>
<br>
Why would they do this ? Well for one, there are greedy people out there.  They may wanna twink a warrior or something, maybe they are short on pp.  <br>
<br>
Scenario 2<br>
----------<br>
Once MB starts hitting the heights that it will when wizards on the server progress more and more, what happens ? You get a boatload of wizards KSing each other.  <br>
<br>
At the end of the day when it comes to Kunark mobs, all the big guilds are pretty much done with them.  However, MOST of the server guilds are not.  This could cause a bitter war between all of the guilds outside of the 'uber' status.  <br>
<br>
At the end of the day, the kunark mobs especially are epic focussed and it is a massive injustice for people to be fighting over wizards. <br>
<br>
Scenario 3<br>
----------<br>
With single mob encounters, wizards can hit quickly and effectively.  Who cares if they die after they unloaded MB.  By their own admission they are useless after this, if every caster class could dump all their mana in one second to ensure maximum effectiveness they would and not care if they die afterwards.  <br>
<br>
So when you have single mob encounters in Velious, for instance Dain/Velkator or whatever.  <br>
<br>
Do you? <br>
<br>
Use a single group to sort out all the crap.  Take 15-20 MB wizards to take care of the mob ? <br>
<br>
Again as the server progresses more and more wizards become available.  <br>
<br>
Comparisons<br>
------------<br>
I havent seen any AA ability that even comes close to MB.  Dire charm is average, but very useful, Warriors have ambidextrous - which is crap, Paladins get undead slapping (which aint too bad), SKs I believe get a harder HT.<br>
<br>
Solutions<br>
---------<br>
For a start MB is unresistable right - please clarify? if not why not make it 30% resistable.  Or because Kunark mobs can be the focus of 6 MB wizards, why not nerf it versus Kunark mobs ? <br>
<br>
If they dont say nerf it versus Kunark mobs, then why should the other classes have the cap on Naggy or Vox ? 1 Normal group would have a good pop at either of them.  Same thing right or is it me ?<br>
<br>
Verant has said that they wont nerf it, that's a natural response.  But if people lean on them enough, then they will change it<br>
<br>
AOE<br>
----<br>
Wizards can be heavily involved in AOE groups.  I honestly think this is fine.  I totally support the fact that they can AOE with certain classes beside them.  They can have problems finding groups, but they do not suffer as much as mages or necros within their fields. <br>
<br>
Just to say once again this is not directed at Wizards as such, but more at Verant for overpowering wizards. <br>
<br>
As I said this would potentially touch some nerves, but its worth discussing<br>

<br>
This is not worth discussing cause you are beating a dead horse.. Verant said Manaburn is balanced end of story but I will fancy your post.<br>
<br>
Scenario 1.<br>
<br>
Will rarely happen... Almost all of the wizards on this server are good natured.. No one would knowingly do that.. And if they did.. It would be here the next day.. Thats stealing in my book.<br>
<br>
Scenario 2.<br>
<br>
If the other group gets there first, they got it.. Wizards will check for kunark dragon pops but won't stawl the zones looking for them.  There is plenty of time to form up a raid.  Most wizards with manaburn have raids to do and won't leave them for a Kunark dragon.<br>
<br>
Scenario 3.<br>
<br>
Wizards aren't useless OOM... I can use click nukes or mana robe or med up and get my mana back up fast. I use manaburn as a tacticular nuke in 100+ hp mobs.. People arent gonna be zerging things with wizards.. The novelty will wear off and people will want a challenge or they would already bring 20 normal nuking wizards or rogues or even warriors.<br>
<br>
Comparisons<br>
<br>
Um Dire charm owns all AA. You see logs of a dire charm giant against AoW? <br>
<br>
Solutions<br>
<br>
Making it 30 person more resistable won't do jack cause then you would just bring an extra 2 wizards to compensate.. Well it would piss people off thats all it would do.  Don't think you can make a spell not work against a group of unrelated mobs like that unless you nerf it for all under 32k mobs.  Verant most likely won't change manaburn cause most people don't care.. Why do you care so much? You a voice for the smaller guilds? or just want another RBB?<br>
<br>
AOE<br>
<br>
Why was AE brought up? anyway  I perfer quading for faster exp but AE if the good is really good can beat quading and by no means is AE totally safe.. in an average AE group the exp isnt that much better than a half decent normal group.. its just more fun in my opinion.<br>
<br>
<br>
You forgot to mention the benefits as people who would never have a chance at an epic cause their guild is too small can get a team of manaburn wizards to do the dirty work for them and get their chance at their epic drop.<br>
<br>
There have been reports of 1 groups of melee taking out kunark dragons.. is that fair too?<br>
<br>
It all boils down to who arrives first.. Doesn't matter the way you kill it.. Everyone has a fair chance that way. <p><center>

<br>
Why do you care so much? You a voice for the smaller guilds? or just want another RBB?<br>
<br>
I dont really mind bro, I was just asking.  In fact the 'smaller' guilds are perhaps as powerful as a lot of the more reputable guilds, you just do not see it.  <br>
<br>
A lot of RiP came from an old guild where I was an officer in and I am well respected by the people within it.  <br>
<br>
About the RBB point, thats implying that I am being a greedy bastard.  Again refer to your guild and ask them if I am a greedy bastard, or ask my guild, ask Lor Mani, ask Wraith, askADD, ask practically anyone for that matter.<br>
<br>
You will get the same answer.<br>
<br>
Flogging a dead horse, your wrong bro.  As Verant is a business, they must bow to their customers.  IF (and I am not saying it will happen) people shout loud enough, (remembering previous points that MB is not widely used atm) it will happen.  <br>

<br>
Now you pay Raluvin... for ages Wizards were worthless... thats right, worthless... our nukes sucked and could be outdamaged by just about any other class that does damage... so they fix us and give us something good and you cry &quot;waah waah manaburn is soooo overpowered&quot;  waahh wahhh... well i say :  BOOOO YOU!<br>
<br>
You are upset because wizards are on the same tier as you now... and you dont like it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your argument is the same as saying &quot;OMFG Ice Comet wiz spell is WAY OVERPOWERED because it can kill ANY MOB in Najena in a SINGLE, yes thats right.. SINGLE hit, please nerf it&quot;...   You know why its the same?  Because when Planes of Power comes out I have a funny feeling a manaburn from a lonely wizard will not even move Solusek Ro's life a single pixel...  <br>
<br>
A 60 wizard usign manaburn on Gorenaire is the same as a 49 wizard using Ice Comet on the blackburrow Commander... Please tho, how many wizards do you see farming blackburrow?... Its not like those kunark dragons actually drop anything good anyway ;p<br>
<br>
<br>
When Raluvin calls &quot;NERF!&quot; I call &quot;DIE!&quot;<br>

And and and...

Boo Raluvin.<br>
<br>
You should talk to your Manaburning wiz mates and ask them about Manaburn so you get ya facts straight.<br>
<br>
Yes, its possible for wizzies to nuke Kunark Dragons. We wont, i repeat WONT, take a Kunark dragon (or VS) off a raid. If there is clearly a raid up there, we might even help (ask your guild, we were helpin them on Gore, but as MA died when Gore was 95% health there was no point in us 2 MBers nuking, wasting our MB and then dieing cus she CH's).<br>
<br>
Once they gave up, we took it down, no harm done. We didnt push, we even helped. I got my corpse stuck in the @#%$ tunnel wall because of DoSG raid.<br>
<br>
If no ones gonna take em down, and we have the numbers, we'll take em down. And you have to remember that we MBing wizzies have had to work our butts off to get the ability, just like chanters with dire charm. Verant have said they wont nerf Manaburn and are happy with what it can do. And their response to the Kunark dragon issue is something along the lines of &quot;Well a 40 wizard can kill D'vinn in Crushbone in one nuke, characters get stronger, its always been that way&quot;.<br>
<br>
MB isnt really overly useful for most of things imo. Its great for gaters, and for Kunark mobs. And is kinda nice if you have a tank in that it doesnt seem to aggro, so on higher HP mobs you can nuke em right at start, then med/rod/etc to full mana while the fight goes on, then carry on nuking.<br>
<br>
Overall, i dont think were unbalanced, a group of 6 balanced classes with 40+ AA each could probably take a kunark dragon too. Just think about that.<br>

Very wrong! We have ambidex, which is alright (7% dmg increase, parsed via warrior boards) And we have AE taunt, easily one of the best warrior AA's, AE taunt makes tank switching trivial, its an unresistable taunt, perfect for swapping tanks in and out. <p><br><img

On most big mobs MB doesn't do that much as I can way out damage over time what MB does on one hit. As for farming dragons, wizards are asses and all I have met that have MB don't intend to just run over 30 person raids. As for a 30 person raid on a Kunark dragon how often do you see that now? Most are under 4 groups and done within a few minutes. It isn't like the old days where you got 30-40 people to kill a 32k hp mob. Just wizzie envy by a ranger, that's ok.

<br>
<br>
I'm just wondering why you care so much?<br>
<br>
<br>
Dire Charm is the best AA there is but every class has one AA that could be considered unbalancing..<br>
<br>
<br>
I wouldnt say wizards sucked before Luclin but they certainly weren't as interesting as today.. over my wizard's life I have comtemplated retiring him numerous times and retired him more times than Michael Jordan has but not since Luclin came out.. I've been a very happy wizard in luclin.<br>
<br>
Most people will join a guild that is above Kunark Dragons or just not join one at all cause even to a full raid the dragons are trivial.<br>
