Reading is fundamental!<br>
<br>
I never said that I don't post often, I said I don't go after my teammates that post stuff I don't like on the flame boards publicly, I talk to them privately if I have an issue and settle it there.<br>
<br>
You seem to have gotten almost half of what I said tho Fkin.. I guess that is an improvement <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Flame boards help nothing. I'd rather send a tell to Ellise or Binedina or Shouja or Sephrok to deal with any conflicts.. even if we don't agree, its better for 2 people to argue their points privately than throw full raid forces at each other that will fan the flames or make a big flame thread loaded with people not involved in either guild making potshots. <br>
---<br>
<br>
Actually Gurunt I was responding to the above quote - your words - Flame Boards help nothing but here you are posting. You then claim to prefer to use private channels when you often spray your abuse here first - your various 'man is keeping us down' threads being a good example of this. Sorry yoy cant remember what you said and/or dont understand what I said Gurunt. Sure I used sarcasm, that was a vain attempt to drive the point home - clearly I failed there.<br>

Gimily I was there and sending tells to LC officers before you had a full group in zone.  Once you ran thru octagon room on our clear wraith were far from virgin saints but we were there in force, pulling, and attempting to talk to you guys.   You did not want to talk, knew were there first and knew what we were after.  I did the /who wraith for 25 or so, /who reviv for 12 or so, and /who lotus for 2 myself.   I talked to your officers and was told by your officers that you didn't care that we were there and intended to take ntov anyway myself.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's a long dead issue.  Your jumping to justify it is exactly my point, tho.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Again, it's not something we've all done at this point... and my point that when ppl do it they tend to justify it or try and make it out different than when it's done to them stands.   I have done it myself in the past,  tried to justify wraith doing something stupid because it was done to us first.   <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

I post here cuz my job is slow and I have net access mostly.  I keep personall atacks to a minimum, but I post often.<br>
<br>
I resolve issues in game generally...when was the last 'man keeping me down' thread I started?   I think it was that Venril Sathir kill back before QQ went south.  I don't recall another offhand.  <br>
<br>
Oh wraith did some horrible thing and someone posts here.. I point out their guild did the same thing the week before... *shrug*<br>

I never said I don't post here.  I never said I don't post here often.  Your making things up to bitch about doesn't help your case any.  Stick to talking about  what people say and you won't seem like you can't understand what they say.<br>
<br>
I said I don't flame my teammates here, I talk with them privately.  I don't flame anyone here that doesn't post here and generally make an ass of themselves *here*.   <br>
<br>
I don't start flame threads here, haven't for a long, long time at least.<br>
<br>
I respond often enough.... but I don't respond calling the other guy names... I usually defend my side and often point out it's the same crap the other guy does too.  On legitimate conflicts I follow up and resolve things in game, not on here.<br>
<br>
I don't claim to be infalliable or that anyone wraith has ever had a conflict with is a crybaby.  <br>
<br>
I seem to be a VERY small minority that admits my guild isn't perfect or actually acknowledges when someone on my team, or my team,  or myself, does something wrong.  <br>

Since I'm pretty sure everyone but Fkin may have gotten the point now, I'll leave it at that... <br>

Maybe this was a figment of my imagination and not something I read: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  even if they won't [change], our friendships are still more important than some other random ppl they accidently <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>or purposely</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> screwed over.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
&quot;WTF has that to do with the topic? it doesnt even have anything to do to reply to my post or explain why you think i am wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
Backtrack. Belhaven starts a thread explaining why, in his view, guilt by association will remain a given. You quote him: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Either you condone thier actions, or you dont care ENOUGH that you fly the same Tag as them</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and respond, and I respond to your quote above. Do I need to break it down any further?<br>
<br>
I think you are wrong for sticking up for your friends irrespective of what they do to others. Random people, as you call non-friends. Got that so far? Therefore, I don't think anyone would be taken by surprise to find out that I think you're scum for (hypothetically) passively condoning your friend.<br>

<br>
&quot;how fuck up it is to hope your friend will change from an evil bastard to an angel? i am grad to not be your friend for sure.&quot;<br>
<br>
You must be some sort of idiot or have a polar set of values to argue that wishing your friends change for the better is wrong and/or should not be desired of them. Please don't clump me into the former just to draw attention away from your yes, incredibly fucked up statement. Shocking that someone would say exactly what's on her mind, isn't it?<br>
<br>
&quot;one more thing, if you put the friend factor into a guild, it becomes more complicated. Person A and B are good friends. Person B and C are good friends. All of them in same guild. Person A did something bad/stupid. Person C got that stupid &quot;Guilt by assocaion&quot;. But person C can't do nothing coz he knows A and B are good friends and C doesnt want B to get hurt.&quot;<br>
<br>
What is so hard about drawing a line? If you need a clear cut example, why would anyone want to be linked with Sendole et al? Would you, who practice the idea that friends should remain friends to the bitter end, stick up for Sendole &amp; Co.'s friends because they're sticking up for Sendole? I doubt it. So why the slack-jawed amazement from posters with the virgin revelation that an opinion will be formed of you for the bad/good company you keep?<br>
<br>
Is this &quot;friend&quot; going to--God forbid--cancel the cable on you? Is this hypersensitive friend incapable of withstanding internal, constructive criticism? Why the hell can't you stand up to the people you care about? (Or is it like Belhaven said, a case where you don't care what happens to these &quot;random people.&quot; And if *that* is the bottom line, you're fucking shitty as far as I'm concerned.)<br>

maybe I wasnt being clear.  ALL the Real life friends that I've made in EQ have been my guildmates at one time.  So they have never been random person to me.  Maybe you make friends differently.  But I was talking about me, and you dont don't know me.  so dont even bother to twist up what I meant, you wont win.<br>

Gimily, what you say and I saw and were told by your officers are different.  I don't know how else to put that.<br>
<br>
0ver 30 of us when the first 2 of you zoned in... Kelsie was one of them.  She was who we first sent a tell to, when it was 30somthing to 2 in zone.  It was a good 30 min till you had started any pulls, from there,  we were already in oct room pulling from north.  I talked to Tattle I think, and mostly Quixotim directly.  When we offered to just try ikiatar and eashan and talk about the rotation later...I specifically offered this... Quixotim told me &quot;too bad&quot;.   We were there first, we cleared octagon, we pulled wyverns, then you ran in north wing.  From there we both got into the ooc/shout crap and started cross-pulling.  <br>
<br>
I don't claim we're misunderstood or pristine.  I claim we are no different.   <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

Random people, as you call non-friends. Got that so far?&quot;<br>
<br>
you are finally posting something human can understand. at least that's an arguement instead of mindless flaming, o well..the other part ofyour post still are..and most of them doesnt make sense at all.  So..i will give you my arguement for this. i would still stick up with my friend no matter what he/she does.  It isn't that I dont care, it's that i care about my friends more than other random ppl.  This is a game, I have more fun hanging around my friends than other random ppl...so no one can force me to dump a friend and pick another.  And for that &quot;Got that so far?&quot; part...this is a GAME, how &quot;FAR&quot; can they get?<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You must be some sort of idiot or have a polar set of values to argue that wishing your friends change for the better is wrong and/or should not be desired of them. Please don't clump me into the former just to draw attention away from your yes, incredibly fucked up statement. Shocking that someone would say exactly what's on her mind, isn't it?&quot;<br>
<br>
that's what exactly most ppl posted saying 'yay' to guilt by assocation EXPECT other ppl to do.  Guilt by assocation = expect ppl to dump their friends, kick them out of guild, Backstab/isolate them when they do something wrong.  Just look at this flame board.  Whoever make a mistake..either on purpose or accident, everyone scream like crazy at their guild and expect them to kick them out or they will be &quot;guilt by assocation&quot;.   You can't argue about this, can you?<br>
<br>
&quot;What is so hard about drawing a line?&quot;<br>
<br>
I have my line...but My line is different from yours, is it that hard to understand?  and no, you have no right to judge if my line is right or wrong.  and sendole, i know a lot of ppl dont like him, but i am sure he has some true friends as well.  Want an example? do you know marc? most every one hate him and calling him asshole..but he treated me very nicely..and i am sure there are more ppl beside me who dont mind being friend with him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Or is it like Belhaven said, a case where you don't care what happens to these &quot;random people.&quot; And if *that* is the bottom line, you're fucking shitty as far as I'm concerned.&quot;<br>
<br>
so..while you keep flaming me...did a thought of &quot;this may hurt woow's feeling&quot; ever cross your mind? i doubted. I am sure I am just random person in your EQ life.  So, in conclusion, you dont care about some random person either...guess you are just as shitty as me as far as I'm concerned. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwooweewoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wooweewoo</A> at: 8/6/02 5:47:19 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=455.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=455.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=455.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=455.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=455.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a> <b>6</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=455.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=455.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=455.topic&start=161&stop=161>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=455.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=455.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=455.topic&index=120><img src=http://xtctripp101.homestead.com/files/qc/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=455.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=455.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=455.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=455.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
