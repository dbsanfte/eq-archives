Wizards can solo, Wizards can quad kite, Wizards can AE grp, Wizards can take down dragons with 5 ppl, Wizards can port, Wizards can have the DPS of a rogue or sometimes surpass that just about in any situation they choose... and their HP / Mana / AC / stats are the same as Encs / necros / Mages who come no where near these abilities..<br>
<br>
Rangers can moderately solo, and can have the dps of a rogue every 72 minutes for a couple mins under the right circumstances..<br>
<br>
Enchanters get crap for dps, DC is situational and can't really be exploited to take down mobs that were supposed to require a balanced raid, wtih minimal effort.. (taht was already nerfed as said above)  DC is one of the very few things they can actualy do to make a difference in a raid regarding DPS. (other then haste / clarity of course which indirectly could count as enchanter's dps)<br>

They say if rangers want tanking ability they need to sacrifice their spells, if they want spells they need to sacrifice their tanking ability.. we were given a happy medium sorta.. same thing goes with SKs / Paladins for the most part...<br>
<br>
Stop blindly defending wizzies when you know they are overpowered.. you guys are so full of ego its worse than &lt;insert name of the person my fellow guildies know has/had a huge ego&gt;.. (not gonna name names, just an inside joke =p) If you can't admit it then you need help. <p><center>

<br>
For rangers to get the dps of a rogue every 72 minutes for a couple mins.. it requires 27 points in Class alone.. thats not counting the 12 points needed to be spent in Arch, and 6 in General.  Rangers dont even have it as easy as wizards to get AA point.. wizzies got their AE groups / quad kites etc.. correct me if im wrong, but the reason AE groups / quad kiting is so popular is because it's GOOD EXP, far surpassing that of &quot;normal&quot; exping.. which is why most wizards who have been at it for a while have well over 40-50 AA points.. i can name a list of wizzies i know have over 50 AA points..<br>
<br>
Not sure if im 100% correct, but Manaburn does only cost 5 points right? Not sure if it has any pre-requisites, but even if it did, that still wouldn't add up to 27 points rangers have to spend for a situational ability that can't be used to trivialize anything... <p><center>

<br>
matter of opinion that other casters come no where near a wizard's abilities.. Enchanters are the most wanted classes in the game raid or not and have a good selection of helper spells. Necros less so but I think dire charm, critical lifetaps and good pets are nice too.. Mages have mod rods and whether they like to use them or not it gives them a huge want not to mention focus items and coth.<br>
<br>
Wizards can solo/quad kit/ae/port/manaburn but none is efficient until atleast 51 except porting and some you can't even do til much higher where as rangers are good from level one.  some situation rogues are better and some wizards are better. I average on uber mobs a 40-60DPS.. I bet you never get that low commonly.. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong or maybe cause I don't have my rend robe (hint hint) but that doesnt seem very rogue like to me.. A wizard has to work VERY hard to get rogue like DPS.. a rogue press A or clicks auto attack.<br>
<br>
To partially steal a quote from Quasqueton.  &quot;How can it be overpowered when it only affects 4 mobs on norrath&quot;<br>
<br>
That seems like a pretty good counter to me.<br>
<br>
I seriously don't feel its overpowered.. Almost never does anyone get any really good drops from one dragon.. Everyone does get something as where a normal raid only a select few will get something... I think that is rather nice don't you?<br>
<br>
Quad kiting isnt really all that fast.. Yes it is faster than normal exp in a good situation but the real pull of quading is you can just pick it up.. Normally people have to wait for groups. Manaburn costs 5 points in Class ability.. you have to atleast get mental clarity 3 and maybe want critical nukes 3 but thats optional.  5 compared to 27 isnt all that close but Rangers do have a lot more desirable class AA than wizards do in my opinion of course.. At 60 AA i feel im done.  <br>
<br>
Let's remember getting wizards into groups isnt exactly easy.  I have heard many stories of wizards who went LFG in a zone, got turned down and then minutes later the same members of the group came by and asked for a port.. That is how the class is preceived with with the flashy quad kiting and translocates. Just a taxi for whom to get your ports from.<br>
<br>
The general concensus from wizards.. Is they worked their asses off from level 1 to 60 (a great accomplishment more than a lot of classes) worked hard for that AA so they deserve manaburn.  Wizards are the hardest class to level to 50 period. Rangers are the easiest to level to 60 period.  Don't deny it cause I know its true I've played both.<br>
<br>
Since when did this become a class vs. class discussion anyway? its pointless.. each class has their ups and downs as intended. Stop trying to say one class is better than another to justify a manaburn change.<br>
<br>
I don't feel manaburn is overpowered. I feel some people abuse it and should be punished.. If you don't agree with me TOO BAD cause Verant doesn't care about any of us.. They do what they feel is best for the game no matter the amount of whining from all sides.<br>

<br>
...no.  There isn't a &quot;most desirable&quot; class really, especialy for raids.. 50 enchanters can't do jack shit.. they are useless without others.. just like most other classes.. useless without others.. hence why raids are visioned to be balanced in classes.. but with MB that throws balance out the window... why have fun killing a mob with l33t special abilities that makes it a challenge when u can watch it suddenly drop as if it were a giant rat.. again.. why even play the game if you justify MBing as balanced &amp; fun.. you pay 12 bux a month, to suddenly watch a 3d model fall to the 3d floor?  I'm sure you can download pre-rendered movies that show a dragon dieing or something (better graphics too!), you'd get the same exact effect, except w/o having to click a manaburn button.. that part is so exausting anyways..<br>
<br>
&quot;Since when did this become a class vs. class discussion anyway?&quot;<br>
<br>
b/c MB is unbalancing =p<br>
<br>
&quot;Wizards can solo/quad kit/ae/port/manaburn but none is efficient until atleast 51&quot;<br>
<br>
I have a lvl 30 wizard in CRAP gear, like 150 int.. and i can quad kite in LOIO, solo fine.. hell probably AE would be fine with knowledgable people.<br>
<br>
&quot;I average on uber mobs a 40-60DPS&quot;<br>
<br>
On luclin mobs i'd say thats about my DPS with meele and/or bow.  Somehow i doubt your DPS is that low though... I played a 60 wiz for a couple raids and know i got alot better dps than that =p<br>
<br>
&quot;How can it be overpowered when it only affects 4 mobs on norrath&quot;<br>
<br>
It effects more than 4 mobs... its only a matter of time before Vindi is MB'd.. Zland if not already.. Kland?.. Sont already.. VS, Trak, Gore, Talend, Sev.... can't wait for the Ragefire MB KS.. it'll happen on some server soon im sure =P<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's remember getting wizards into groups isnt exactly easy.&quot;<br>
<br>
And your implying getting groups is a ranger is easier? lol  Just about every exp group i get *I* formed it... b/c there wasn't any other alternatives.<br>
<br>
Rangers aren't nescesarily the *easiest* to level.. soloing animals is VERY efficient i'll agree, but it doesn't mean its the best exp.. soloing animals in WW for me is the same exp as groupin in a guildy exp group.. and thats with a 50% spell haste cloak that like.. 10 ranger or less have on the server... its just somethin to do if im bored or can't find a group (not that i look anymore).  Necro is probably the easiest to level.. but i wouldn't know from actual experience.<br>
<br>
&quot;I feel some people abuse it and should be punished&quot;<br>
<br>
If it can be abused, it will be abused... so it should be prevented. <p><center>

You can run a raid for 99% of the high end mobs in the game with a single chanter.  Anything beyond 3 or 4 enchanters is really overkill for most encounters in EQ.  You can run a raid with a single wizard as well, I don't deny that, however adding more and more wizards is actually a greater benefit to the raid than adding more and more chanters.  If you want to say most desirable grouping class then I'll give you that, I did levels 1-60 as a complete newb on my first char with zero PLing in under 50 days played, but please don't confuse that with raid desirability.<br>
<br>
As far as DC goes there isn't one luclin high end encounter I can think of that it's actually usable in.  Nothing DCable in the deep (not like I could get it across the bridge anyways), DCable things in Greig can't click through the portal with me, nothing worthwhile dcable in Ssrae (unless you count those little iksar slaves who die in an ae or two), DCable things in Seru can't port up with the arx key, and DCed mobs can't kill an old world dragon.  So DC chanterwise is only beneficial in one raiding zone in the entire game and that would be kael (or SS if you plan on running your pet way up to Yeli for the few minute long encounter and can do so avoiding everything on the way up).  <br>
<br>
MB on the other hand can be used for every single boss mob type encounter in the game and in some cases can actually be the only weapon used to kill these bosses.  So basically what I'm saying is comparing MB to DC is pretty silly as they're two totally different types of skills.<br>
<br>
And I am 95% sure that Tunare can be manaburned if you could actually find some poor saps to clear the plane for your attempt. =P<br>
<br>
Also if you're only doing 40-60 dps wtf are you doing on a raid?  Even if all you do is chain cast ice spear it's 1200/(3.5sec cast time + 13 second recast time) = 72.72 dps (not counting imp dmg 3 items or crits).  If you add in a sunstrike inbetween casts of ice spear you're doing (1200+1615)/16.5 seconds = 170dps (a cast of sunstrike will fit w/in the window it takes for ice spear to pop again and yes I know you can't chain cast that w/out having to use concussion here and there).  I'm not taking into consideration resists but I'm also not taking into consideration extra dmg from focus items or crits.  <br>
<br>
I don't claim to be this super smart wizard person but the math seems to speak for itself, wizards are by far the best dps against any luclin encounter hands down and if you say they aren't you're smoking something.<br>

Mana transfer is gay.<br>
<br>
Focus items are a joke.  Hunting out one person in a 50 person raid to hand them a focus item isn't fun.  Other summoning duties.. like *cough* summoning people food and water sucks.  Summoning arrows for like 40 melees to shoot their little bow during the cursed fight is gay.  It has to be done, but a magician is not the same as a vending machine.  But during most fights, I end up having the least amount of agro if we ever need to camp for some reason..<br>
<br>
Coh on raids suck, you've probably been on the other end of setting it up.<br>
<br>
People seem to always forget that we debuff nearly as good as shamans (mala is -35, malo is -45), for when the chanter has to slow because a shaman isn't around. We also can help malosini, to get mobs slowed quicker.<br>
<br>
Wizards live a very safe life with their snares, roots, epic rune and evacs.  Safe travelling to me is having gate and my six second to cast earth pet up.<br>

As far as you finishing at 60AA, after maxing casting mastery and quick summoning, all other advancements are marginal aside from casting fury, which is most useful to show people like you where those mod rods are coming from (someone that nukes for less than a druid!). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufaithkills.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faithkills</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/13/02 1:49:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=369>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I think the evidence points to the fact that VI designed those encounters to actually enforce 'thinking outside the Holy Trilogy' and coming up with other methods of succeeding in those encounters. - Tenasi<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I think the evidence is obvious to a blind deaf mute that no strategy but one based on MT need apply in almost all situations. Period. I know of a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> very</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> few successful strategies other than an MT based one on very specific mobs.<br>

The reason for this is that CH rotations provide a practically indefinite amount of healing.<br>

You see the tree but not the forest. They didn't &quot;forget&quot;. It was impossible to DO so. They came up with a few tricks by the time Luclin came out, to make it more difficult to control aggro, but the bottom line is it's almost always an MT based strategy.<br>

<br>
There IS no strategy. Maybe the first person who figured out any given mob had some cleverness. But again they only had to make the given situation have controllable aggro.<br>
<br>
It's not BALANCED either in any sense. BALANCED would mean any collection of toons could do it. But that's not the case. There is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> no substitute</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for clerics and warriors. Those two classes are mandatory. There is no balance.<br>
<br>
Think about it. If clr*war power was not so exponential it would be possible for a ranger say to have a starring role with a little more healing support. Say a ranger has 20% less HP/AC then with 20% more healing support it out to be possible for a Ranger to tank. But that's not how it works. 20% more HP/AC becomes a multiplicative factor because CH does not heal a fixed amount, it heals the whole thing.<br>
<br>
Balanced would mean that hybrids could accomplish the same thing given a little more support. Thats not how it is. CH cancelled any chance of that ever happenning. CH forced mobs to have such a high DPS/AC/HP that ONLY the most optimal strategy could possibly work.<br>
<br>
CH did break the game. They admitted it and stated they won't do that again in EQ2. In EQ2 your hybrid will actually be able to be useful given a reasonable amount of assistance. Using a made up number a Warrior will be 20% better tank, not infinitely better tank than a Ranger, say. It will also not be necessary to have the insanely high DPS/AC/HP of mobs since healing ability will be linear.<br>

What you forget is that Wizard DPH sucks hind tit. UNTIL they get 20-30 AA under their belt.

Do you realise how many warriors are on this server? And no warriors AREN'T necessary in an EXP group setting, a Pally, SK or even a ranger can do just fine in most cases.

<br>
The only classes that never really have troubles getting groups are clerics, and maybe chanters (although bards easily take a chanters place in most cases) the only dif between you and me FK, is that when I was  sitting on my ass for hours trying to get a group in whatever zones, YOU could easily port to a dif spot and see if you could find a group, or worse comes to worse you could solo....as a warrior back in the day with my crafted armor and wurmslayer, I couldn't solo a high green without having to run to the zone.<br>
<br>
And how the hell do you say a wizzie slows down an EXP group? obviously you've been doing AE to damn long and lost yer mind <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   My 'Ideal' EXP group has always included a wizzie (War, Rogue, shammy, cleric, chanter, wizzie) and my actual EXP group that I'm with 75% of the time DOES include a wizzie (Quasqueton) Hell with C3 now, Ill take a wizzie over an extra melee, becuase their DMG potential is almost as good.<br>
<br>
And like Seph and Salta said, DC  is very situational, basically can only use it in Kael, granted I see it as maybe being a problem in the future vs vindi/statue/AoW or Tormax encounters (imaginge 7 or 8 DC pets at once lol) but thats about all its good for...and as far as making money soloing the Kael arena, you're smoking crack again...drops in kael are rare as hell..and even then its not really profitable...can maybe get a few K for armor pieces seeing as most people already have better than Thurg armor, and even if they don't, theres MUCH better armor available that is player made and dropable (cultural armor for melee and clerics...new CT silk armor for casters) Its nothing compared to the money you can make farming epic drops, dragon haste and more so rare kunark spells like torpor and Malo (which you can sell for insane amounts of money)<br>
<br>
Heh, it's funny how this whole debate started over some people voiceing concerns about the potential problems for people abusing MB for bottom feeding or KSing...and now theres even reported events (on this server, and more so on others) and you always seem to try to twist it around to a class envy thing and point out how other high AA toons are overpowered as well (so far ive heard rangers pallys and chanters are overpowered form various wizzies)  Wizards have always been overpowered DPS wise, and now verant gives them an ability that completely trivializes old world epic encounters, and when people say something about it, you all whine about how oppressed wizards were and how people are just jealous now....hell now you even attack verant for making most encounters rely on a main tank setting...but hello? are you a fooking retard? a MT setting will always be the most effecient way to do things..regardless of which class is the MT...if the mob is always hitting 1 person...then healers only have to worry about healing 1 person, and not healing 20 or 30 if ping pong mobs all over the place.  The way you seem to want to do things would be basically get 200 people and zerg a mob and hope it dies b4 it kills you all instead of using 24 and focusing aggro on 1 tank while the others beat the mob down unmolested.<br>

Not every class is supposed to be able to do everything!  Rangers cant feign death, monks cant port, wizards cant tank.  <br>
<br>
Differant classes excel in differant situations.  Some classes are better for raids while others are better at soloing.  Some classes start out powerful and become weaker at higher levels.  Some start out weak and become very powerful.  Wizards just happen to be the class that starts the weakest and ends up the most powerful (damagewise at least).<br>
<br>
Everyone here is bitching about how they dont have some uber AA ability or class skill.  Guess what, not every class is supposed to have an uber AA ability or class skill!  <br>
<br>
I'll use druids as an example.  I hear druids bitching all the time about how they aren't able to contribute as much as other classes on high end large raid content.  Druids whine that they need better heals and better nukes because they are so much weaker than clerics and wizards!  Well guess what, if druids could heal as well as clerics AND nuke as well as wizards, why the hell would anyone ever play a cleric or wizard?  Druids are not a &quot;raiding&quot; class.  Hate to burst your bubble =(.  Druids are a class that is best suited towards single player ability and smaller sized encounters.  Jack of all trades, master of none.  They have the ability to do well in any situation, whereas other classes only excel in certain environments (paladins vs undead mobs and rogues in places they can backstab).<br>
<br>
Dont get your panties in a bundle, wizards whine a lot too.  Take a look at the wizard forums over at graffe.com.  I garuntee you that at any given time you'll find some wizard whining because they &quot;suck in exp groups&quot;, how &quot;low level wizards cant do jack&quot; and how they &quot;need clarity 3 just to keep up with a paladins DPS&quot;.  Guess what wizzies, for most of your existance, you're not as good at standard exp situations as other classes are!  Wizards start out the weakest, but as their reward for their perserverence, end up the most powerful (in terms of damage and versitility in end game encounters).  As a downside, wizards spend a lot of time medding aren't as consistently useful to exp grind groups as other classes for most of their life.  When wizzies finally reach the upper levels, especially once they reach 60 and start getting major AA skills, they become very good in groups and acquire some extremely fast and efficient ways of killing things through AE groups and quad kiting.  Toss in some FT items, high level spells, some c3, a horse, a manarobe (/cheer horsey med), and a few HP buffs to keep you alive, all of a sudden you've got a wizzy thats tossing 2k+ nukes around like mad and almost never stoping to med!<br>
<br>
Differant classes have differant abilities.  Enchanters can DC solo in kael, monks can FD their way out of almost any bad situation, necros can solo extremely well, druids can contribute in virtually every situation and environment, and wizards can blow up a dragon in a single glorious volley of fire.  If you think that wizards are so much better, why dont you go make one for yourself?  Although you'll probably end up quitting somewhere around level 15 =P.<br>

<br>
Absolutely true, for the most part. Yes if I can't find a group I can move or solo. Yes Warriors are not required to grind XP.<br>
<br>
But we BOTH know Warriors are preferred in xp groups over Wizards. And not by a little bit.<br>
<br>
I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  know</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> how frustrating it is for a Warrior when he can't get a group. And it does happen. It even happens to Clerics.. but.<br>
<br>
The REAL difference between me and YOU Montyy, is not our race or class. Because WE are not toons. The real difference is I am not lobbying to nerf the class other people play. I never have. On the contrary for example I think Warriors have issues in the high end game that need to be addressed. Specifically the usefullness of their AA compared to some other classes. And I have made many posts to this affect and to the dev board as well. And not just about Warriors. Warriors are not the only class with issues either. When people were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  whining</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> about the tiny little bone they threw mages with focus items I went to bat for them too. I wrote several posts to Absor and we had an email conversation about it. And in the end foci were just dealt a glancing blow with the nerf bat. I have no idea if it had any effect but it certainly couldn't have hurt. <br>
<br>
I'm not complaining about MT. It's the game we play. I am glad EQ2 will not have CH so the game can be more interesting. But CH is here to stay in EQ, and MT is here to stay, and I'd never dream of suggesting it be nerfed.<br>
<br>
I just think it is highly ironic how much the people who use the same tired old strat, (which by the way ensures certain classes are more valuable and thus generally treated better) all the time WHINE so much when a small handful of mobs can be taken down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  without</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> MT.<br>
<br>
Get over yourselves. Warriors are still the star. This won't change in EQ ever. PoP will be even worse and require longer and longer CH chains. And it will all be hanging off you Montyy.<br>
<br>
The Warrior.<br>
<br>
And I have NO problem with that. I respect the work it takes to get a Warrior to a title level, and what they can do, and FULLY realize 99% percent of all raid content in the game absolutely requires Warriors to play the star role.<br>
<br>
I do not begrudge this in the least.<br>
<br>
But it would be nice if the respect was returned. But I guess to you the work it takes to get a class title means nothing unless you are a warrior. The fact that some other class might be able to do 1% (and thats a rather optimistic figure) is just the end of the fucking world. Boohoo. Warior not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  required</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on 4 mobs in the game. Heavens to betsy, whatever shall we do.<br>
<br>
So don't even try to turn this around.<br>

I don't have any delusions of stardom. I know MY role, and it's a supporting role. Except now for 4 mobs, on occasion.<br>

<br>
On the flip side of the coin, the ability comes with a terrible responsibilty to &quot;do the right thing&quot; Why? Because if wizards don't self police the conflicts of MB VI can, and almost certainly will do it for them, I believe. They will only listen to so much griping, moaning, complaining, from the Eq community as a whole,  before they make the changes. Just like so many other times where they could &quot;never&quot; change a certain thing then months down the road they some how managed it.<br>

I think the thing most people are after is this.. Wizzies please nuke responsibly, enjoy your new skill. You have earned it you deserve it.. don't screw yourselves out of it with too many bad judgement calls while using the abillity.<br>

And for those wizzies who almost gloatingly retort &quot;they said they have no plans to change it&quot;.. here is what they say as quoted by a pretty reputable source. Eq.castersrealm<br>

&quot;Right now we dont see it being too much of a problem in the Kunark areas.  Really as it stands right now we dont have any real plans to go back and change manaburn on the non PvP servers.&quot;<br>

Valid points. And they have and will again go back on their position.<br>
<br>
I suspect this won't be such a time but certainly I could be wrong.<br>
<br>
But all we can do on Quellious is try to police ourselves. A couple small spats aside, I don't think anyone will argue that compared to other servers we have not comported ourselves well.<br>
<br>
And if it is nerfed because of abuse, then so be it.<br>
<br>
However the debate here shows that people are whining about it NOT because of abuse, but because of class envy.<br>
<br>
Some people don't like to share the spotlight. It's not about abuse here, because there hasn't been any.<br>
<br>
4 mobs don't require MT in the whole damned game. Oh the horror. For 4 mobs in the whole game my Wiz toon is actually more important than a Warrior. Oh the humanity. Oh the injustice. Someone must be NERFED!<br>

<br>
CoF 70-75k<br>
RBB 40-50k<br>
Green scale ? no clue 30K+?<br>
Red Scale 10k or so<br>
Torpor ? agian dunno 30k? more?<br>
Malo same dunno 30k if not more though<br>
<br>
these are a few Items you can get and sell form a Dragon Burn...<br>
<br>
now...<br>
<br>
Plate boots, bracer, arms, helm, gloves MQ 5k (maybe)<br>
Plate legs MQ 10k maybe<br>
PLate BP MQ dunno 20kish?<br>
<br>
Cant say much about leather, chain or SIlk, but most are cheap, only ones worht anythign are BP items maybe.<br>
<br>
Time I have spent hunting in Kael arena... 30+ raids (used to go twice a week)<br>
<br>
Amount of BP's I've seen drop in the Kael arena in that time....1 silk and 1 leather.<br>
<br>
You can't make nearly as much money soloing in the Kael arena than you can make burning dragons <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You're smoking the good stuff if you think you can, so pass it over <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And please spare me the warriors are more wanted in a EXP group than a wizzie...warriors fill the tank spot..only 1 needed in a group...we are competing with the million other wars on the server, as well as the SK's and Pally's...Wizzies are competing for the Snare/evac role with Druids...and if there is a shammy in the group, a druid is basically useless, therefore a wizzie becomes very attractive.  So please cry me a river with you sob story about how unwanted a wizard is in a group <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And as for people needign to have a title over their head to earn respect, thats a bunch of BS also...you think if somoen has venerable, or Master or even Sage in front of their name it warretns my respect? Hell no, I know of MANY wizards and chanters who have 3 or 4 times more AA than me who I kindsider frekaing idiots who don't know how to play their class cuz they've sat in FG for the past 4 months AEing non stop.  On the same note I know plenty of people with no title at all, or hell even people who aren't 60 that have my upmost respect as players....hell IMO the best Wizard skillwise just recently got his baron title and isn't even close to MB yet.... yet he is hands down the best wizard if ever know in a grouping situation....speaking from a warrior standpoint, as well as a chanters standpoint.  AA doesnt mean a damn thing....AA was verant throwing us a bone to keep people EXP grinding...even then it favors people who 2box and Plvl, or wizzies and chanters who can AE.....I EXP all the time and I have 20 AA, where as if I were an AE wizzie or chanter playing the same time I'd prolly have 60+<br>
<br>
Anyway, you seem to say that we are all getting upset for nothing, and why should we all get upset cuz' wizzies are killing 1% of the mobs out there...then on the same note...why the hell are wizzies burning dragons none stop when they dont even drop anythign they need? Oh yeah you need sunstrike..which all MBers proll already have and that sucky flaming sword spell with is worthless <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Twist it around anyway you want...it coems down to bottom feeding, period, and it IS a probelm as we see on other servers..and it WILL become a probelm on this server as more morons AE their way to MB and we have MB crews all over the place burning crap <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
his name is Knollen and if you knew him, he was a great guy.<br>
<br>
He did slow down our exp groups though.  First gnome I ever ressed, but certainly not the last.  He introduced me to AE groups too, and after all those mobs killed us all in SolA, I begged him never to do that again.  Of course he refused, and he killed us all over and over for a good long time after that.<br>

I sure miss him.<br>

I wasn't talking about wizards whinning that they cant find groups.  I was talking about wizards that get IN a group but are unhappy because they dont feel they are able to contribute as much as many of the other classes.  Which is true in many ways for the first 50 or so levels, but its the tradeoff for high end capabilities.  Its like every single racing computer game that has ever been made, the car with the highest top speed always takes forever to accelerate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usephrokdapathfinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sephrok da Pathfinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/13/02 9:09:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=379>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> &quot;Balanced would mean that hybrids could accomplish the same thing given a little more support. Thats not how it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hybrids *can* accomplish the same thing given a little more support.  Rangers, SKs, Paladins, are all viable tanks vs a good deal of ubermobs.  Sometimes even BETTER then warriors because of their ability to aggro with spells a bit better.<br>
<br>
Rangers used to be in that whole &quot;we suck&quot; stage... rangers brought it upon themselves.. i thought it was stupid rangers were whining so much, i was happy with what we had.. they kept whining and whining.. VI eventualy gave in and upgraded what was already a strong class...<br>
<br>
Same thing happened with wizards imo.  I&quot;ve always liked wizards in groups.. i remember in sebilis back in the day when the zone used to be hard.. we pulled to many mobs, and the wizzy was able to help drop a mob or 2 VERY quickly which helped out alot.. and i feel they contributed enough dps to hold their &quot;spot&quot; in the group... as long as they were a good wizard that doesn't afk and watch tv the whole time like a lot of wizards do =p<br>
<br>
You guys keep saying its only 4 mobs.. well the same people who are saying its only 4 mobs.. i better not *EVER* see you completely MBing anything *but* those 4 mobs you are implying to.. VS, Talendor, Gore, Sev?  But unfortunetly it will happen because you dont care about the balance of the game, all you care about is some stupid ego and being able to make a buncha money from mbing those things.<br>
<br>
Arena armor is so #)%* rare... i recently spent like 20-30 hours there factioning with decent fast paced giant killing... we got like.. 0 drops.. DC enc would probably get 1 drop in 100-200 hours givin that rate.. and you're saying thats &gt; MB? bullsh*t... there you go trying to say MB is unsuperior to other things when you know just as well its overpowered.. but there's that ego shit again.. <p><center>
