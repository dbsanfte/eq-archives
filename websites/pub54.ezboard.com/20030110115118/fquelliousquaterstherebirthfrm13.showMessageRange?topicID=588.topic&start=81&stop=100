<br>
The current Wraith and the current Vis are getting along well, and have a solid working relationship, with Lotus included in our tripartite love-fest where the big mobs are concerned.<br>
<br>
I personally have respect for the scrappy, up and coming guilds like RIP who are willing to fight for what they want, but doing it with style.  RIP, you may notice has not made legions of haters, nor do they inspire mass postings on QC.  Explicit, on the other hand, has and does.  Res ipsa loquiter, latin for &quot;the thing speaks for itself.&quot;<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, too, that I am just an SK and always only speak for myself and only comment on my personal observations.<br>

Wrong on Tomax.  Rel had less than 20, they knew they didn't have the force to take him and we did.   They teamed with VM and got him before us.  More power to them.  We didn't follow them around the next day (either guild) and try to rush a mob every time we saw them move toward it.   We weren't even mad at them or VM.... what they did was SMART.. they had too few to do it themselves, knew they couldn't take him first alone, called Vis in (who had numbers nearby but realized Rel and Wraith were already there).. and got the job done.   Sure we would have *preferred* to have gotten him, but we didn't go on a tirade about it.<br>
<br>
Your only statement last nite was you don't care if ppl are at a mob in full force, you will rush it anyway.   Your only statement last night was you want to fight, and do not want to work things out.  <br>
<br>
None of the other top guilds camp ubermobs anymore BECAUSE it leads to fights.   It always has, always will.  Nobody agrees on how many ppl minimum it takes for a mob.. either for themselves or others.  <br>
<br>
Cursed is different from a lot of mobs... you can trigger and tie him up with almost nothing... that is why he is still on rotation.  (I know this is a broken record at this point)... nobody rotates HP or AoW or Arch Lich because nobody (cept Explicit) moves in to claim these mobs before they are ready to kill them.   <br>
<br>
If Wraith were to send 18 ppl to every ubermob as soon as it popped, you think Vis and LC would leave them all alone?  We're all past that.  We all know we'd fight over crap if we rushed an early holding crew to claim mobs, and none of us WANT to have to sit at a spawn for hours waiting for the calvalry to log on knowing we'll have conflict with the other guilds.<br>
<br>
I don't blow off people.  I *am* honest when I'm not the one in charge and can't make a final decision.  Desi may not be the greatest diplomat in the history of Quellious, but he is hardly unreasonable when you come to discuss things rationally.  Not jump another raid then try to talk, or try to talk when you can't kill the mob and hope the rest of your team logs in while you chat.   <br>
<br>
You want in on cursed?  Just ask.  Not when he's up and you have half a force there trying to hold of a full raid.  Ask tonite, this weekend.. when he's not up... when nobody is mobilizing at the time to kill him.  <br>
<br>
Don't want &quot;leapfrogging&quot; fights?  Don't camp the mobs... move in and kill the mobs instead.   Vis/LC/Wraith can have a group or two at every ubermob within minutes of  a pop to camp it until the calvalry arrives... you think mobs are left alone for hours at a time because we don't know they are up?  If LC has a force on sooner they will move in and take it.  If if Vis has a force on sooner they will move in and take it.  We won't bother sending a placeholder team to try and fend them off, and they don't do it to us.   <br>

Where you see me denying we leapfrog you? i am not desi, i dont lie.  We did leapfrog you, on purpose, to make a statement.  We are not going to back off from any of desi's 'you dont have enough' crap anymore.  I don't like it, I don't want to do it, it's not fun for me.  But if wraith don't want us to have fun, we are not going to let you guys have fun either.<br>
<br>
&quot;following another guild to a mob, then jumping past them at an opportune moment, is the lowest of the low. Clearing to a mob is part of the definition of an encounter&quot;<br>
<br>
how did you justify the cursed conflict then? we started the cycle -----&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;part of an encounter, desi lied to GM, wraith leapfrog us to kill cursed.../em wait for someone to say 'we have more ppl than you so you should back off'.  So..now, you tell me. have you convinced yourself you did not leapfrog, or have you convinced yourself you were justified in leapfrogging? More stable minds want to know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uketelkaotic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ketel Kaotic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tolapumj wanna-be</span><br>  Posts: 241<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/18/02 1:57:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ketelkaotic.com/dancer2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTB planar rifts</span><hr size=1> gimply, you plan on retiring again anytime soon?<br>

<br>
There was precedent on this with GM's repeatedly.  You can't claim a mob without the force to kill it.<br>
<br>
Cursed is a majorly f'ed up mob cycle when it's ffa becasue 2 people could claim it if we played your way.   We could send 2 ppl to the  basement at any time, kill a TM, then say &quot;we'll be able to kill him by the time he spawns later&quot;.   You *would* respect that, right?  <br>
<br>
Obviously we don't.  History shows at least LC don't.  So to keep things civil since Cursed has the best pre-emperor drops and is so easily tied up, we rotate him.<br>
<br>
One problem with rotations... they are GREAT when the mob is exclusive.... they get to be a problem when it is not.   You guys have no choice BUT to bust into the rotation if you want a shot... so conflict at some point is inevitable.   Unlike other mobs, if we say 'ah fuck it' and leave.. we don't get to come back next spawn... we gotta wait for our turn again.  So we're not gonna back down unless you are clearly there with the immediate intent and capacity to kill.  Cursed is a 3 week spawn for us.  18 is nowhere near a cursed force.  With one cleric it may not even been an ae-less cursed force. <br>
<br>
You don't want to fight?  Stop fighting, start talking... start playing with the rest of the server.  <br>
<br>
Name calling and bitching here is meaningless.... all the big 3 have made novels worth of it.. but the fact is we get along as a whole and we don't jump each other.   Fact is you do.  So continue, or stop.  Don't matter how much Desi and Darkoor may not *like* you, don't matter how much you don't like them... come to the table to work things out, they'll get worked out... and the random MB trolls who get off on this sort of thing (/wave salta) will be the extent of it from then on.<br>

<br>
Please answer that question..because it is a FACT that you had 17 guild members online when you started to try and trigger the cycle...YES you killed the first Taskmaster.  Wraith had 54 people Ready in the zone to your 17 TOTAL ONLINE!<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you saying we were wrong because your 17 (actually 15 because 2 people where not in ssra) killed the first taskmaster? and therefore are entitled the entire cycle?<br>
<br>
Wraith was moving down to the basement as the TM's were reportedly FINALLY spawning...We had 20 to 30 in the basement and everyone else enroute...but IN THE ZONE!!  Explicit saw that this was happening, and decided to start killing triggers with 15 people...EXPLICIT was NOT ready to engange the cursed cycle, Wraith/reviv WAS...We engaged it, you didn't.  You wanna petition GM's and try to be civil when you know your getting beat...bullshit...we were ready and we killed it...end of fucking story...You wanna race, untill you are getting beat...then you wanna be a diplomat...BULLSHIT!! k?<br>

But they just didn't have enough to show &quot;significantly more people&quot; than wraith.  Knowing wraith is going to leapfrog them no matter what they said to wraith, they called for help. yup..smart of them.  VM/Rel buff up, showing &quot;significantly&quot; more ppl than wraith/revive. Did wraith/revive back down? nope.  VM/Rel Started clearing.  Did Wraith/Reviv back down(clearing is a part of encounter)?nope.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Your only statement last nite was you don't care if ppl are at a mob in full force, you will rush it anyway. &quot;<br>
<br>
Just like what Wraith have been doing to us. Except with an excuse &quot;we think you dont have enough force&quot;.  What goes around, comes around.  You guys only had 40s, &quot;we didnt think you have enough force&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Your only statement last night was you want to fight, and do not want to work things out.&quot;<br>
Hard to work things out when your leaders either ignore or insult us.  Good..at least you notice us now.  We tried to be fair, we tried to work things out.  But can't you guys be any more unreasonable?  I remember one time, HP and creator both up.  We saw wraiths in zone, do camp check, send tell to desi asking what you are killing..no respond.  OMG..how nice of you guys.  So we thought we may as well clear up since wraith can't kill 2 mobs same time.  We cleared up, have coth set up, buffing for hp...guess what wraith did? LEAPFROG us after killed creator and kill hp...yeah, now that i think about it, wraith really wants to work things out. <br>
<br>
&quot;Don't camp the mobs... move in and kill the mobs instead&quot;<br>
We did exactly that..last night.  Didn't camp, just move in, you like that? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/udeloresmulva.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Delores Mulva</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Reet Knight</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/18/02 2:27:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTB Planar Rifts</span><hr size=1> Acturian - you might want to check that portal again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The events I detailed happened between two and four weeks ago, IIRC - Arianwen was on the raid with us, she might remember her first time up there for an exact time.

<br>
He was trying to back up his earlier comment, that Explicit had killed some of the Taskmasters yet Wraith claimed to the GM that Wraith had killed them all and thus was entitled to the spawn. He didn't really care who was &quot;entitled&quot; to the spawn - he just wanted to point out that the leadership of Wraith are two-faced sacks of shit.<br>
<br>
It's something that's hard to get across when flaming Wraith/Reviv, but Woow touched on it in this thread. The guilds that &quot;hate&quot; W/R don't hate most of the people in W/R. They hate one small group, the leadership group of Wraith, and the sorts of crap that one group pulls. I wish more people would be specific about that, since it might open some eyes in W/R as to the assclowns you have representing you. Instead you get people in the two guilds who have done nothing wrong but follow orders from their leaders feeling like they are personally hated, and a bunker mentality forms. Like Denia's. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And? We had number for cursed, we started it. Wraith moved in.  and your point is?  HP, we didnt have enough yesterday, Wraith move in without saying a word, we left....and your point is?  You guys just dont care as long as you have more ppl than us.  What force? we have more ppl than you, so you dont have enough force! <br>
<br>
&quot;Cursed is a majorly f'ed up mob cycle when it's ffa becasue 2 people could claim it if we played your way. We could send 2 ppl to the basement at any time, kill a TM, then say &quot;we'll be able to kill him by the time he spawns later&quot;. You *would* respect that, right? &quot;<br>
Or you can just send a group to kill a TM when another guild is doing cursed cycle.  OMG..wasnt that wraith?  No, I don't respect that. But it wasnt what happened on wed.  VM cleared some TM for bags and left...Exp moved in and wait for repop to start cycle before wraith got there.  We started it, wraith KSed it and spawn named.  bah.forget it, you will just continue to give me the leature of &quot;we dont think you have enough so we leapfrog you&quot;....<br>
<br>
&quot;You don't want to fight? Stop fighting, start talking..&quot;<br>
rofl..talk with who?  hard to talk when you guys just ignore/insult/change your mind every 2 sec.  I posted already, find someone who will treat us with respect (at least no insult), can make decision, and won't ignore us.  Then we can talk.  You can't keep saying we dont want to work things out when you guys keep ignoring/insult us.  About VM and LC, dont worry, we talk.  On cursed, remember one time rel on cycle, LC want cursed, we wanted cursed...we moved out even though we were there first.  one time, we want cursed, LC want cursed, they moved out.  Yesterday, LC want cursed, we want cursed, we moved out even we had more.  VM want cursed, we want cursed, they beat us to mine even they dont have enough, we moved out.  We want tormax, VM want tormax, we there first, VM didn't jump us (although some members couldnt keep mouth shut in both side..but that's another story).  Beside some minor conflicts, I think we are doing pretty good on respecting each other.  It's mainly those certain wraith leaders who keep insulting and ignoring us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwooweewoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wooweewoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tolapumj wanna-be</span><br>  Posts: 244<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/18/02 3:05:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTB Planar Rifts</span><hr size=1> &quot;but i guess it is justified because you guys don't like desi..&quot;<br>
