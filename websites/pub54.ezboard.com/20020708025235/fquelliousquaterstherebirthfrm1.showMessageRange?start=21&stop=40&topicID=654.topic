This has got to be one of the biggest cluster fucks VI has ever made. To see the clerics of Quellious banding together to make some sort of sense out of all of this makes me proud. One question though...what about the clerics who have no guild? Or the ones who's guild only has the minimum 10 members? In a perfect world, they would be added to the list and when the time came they could count on the ones who are already there to help them.<br>
<br>
Nice idea.<br>
<br>
I'm ready to help, anytime. If Rage spawns and I'm needed, I'll be there. I'm all for clerics with rez sticks, less mana wasted in raids and such. And if you don't see me in a /who all alle, check for my alts, send me a tell and I'll be there so fast.<br>

You do this in case the Gemlins and the Ketels are there, as they play by FCFS hardcore (or so there posts say, i dont know either of ya, just going from what i just read.)<br>
This way you are following verant's rule of First Engagement, (since they play by rules) and they cant touch otherwise it's a KS.<br>
<br>
You engage while others arrive, it's done to stop other guilds from steamrolling. Turn on logs right as you engage in case another guild decides they are higher then people + rules and they'll get the <br>

&quot;My guild just KS'd ragefire and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!&quot; <br>

cause it's all they'll get. Playing fare is better then FCFS, but some people cant seem to decide . I've given up the Bracer of Benevolence 3 times so far to have the scout pop within the hour of me giving the camp. I could've done FCFS on them, but i stepped down because it was the right thing to do. Sometimes we need to find out if our actions are more important then what we are being told, if it's wrong, guess what, if youre being told to KS, it's bullshit. Only YOU are hitting that attack button, or that button to heal the people who just engaged. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwhytspirit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whytspirit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Of the Nexus</span><br>  Posts: 309<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/30/02 12:17:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Waiting List?</span><hr size=1> OK, I have to add my 2c as a member of a guild who experienced the grueling 6 day wait for Ragefire. We were there faithfully 24/7 the whole time. At times we may have had a few people, but that was brief, and in the wee hours of the morning. One time for about an hour during the whole Rage camp there were only two of us. And we had lots of friends to support us as well. We made sure that no one ever left the cleric alone.<br>
<br>
Here is the way it worked then, and I am sure it is probably still working this way:<br>
<br>
Interested parties, guildies, and friends help camp Ragefire. Generally a cleric who is ready to step up to bat next spawn will lend their support. When the time comes to restart camp after he has been killed, the cleric claims the spawn, along with a good force of guildies/friends to help establish it. It was never once stated in the way the camp has been going that ONE cleric is camping it. The Ragefire camp requires the support of a cleric's whole guild, and their friends. Otherwise it is doomed to fail. That is when the KSing issues have arisen most often. <br>
<br>
In the event that 2 or more clerics want the camp, they *gasp* work it out honorably. Hard to believe isn't it? And I would imagine on this &quot;list&quot; that if the next one who is aiming to camp it really wants to camp it, they will make sure they are there lending a hand the week before, otherwise, they kinda lose claim to it. <br>
<br>
This system, while not official, and by no means is the &quot;list&quot; set in stone, is working because the clerics have taken control of their epics and have figured out the best possible solution for a crappy situation. Is it perfect? Probably not. Can it be superceded by dishonorable people who want to waste 6 days hard spent by a cleric and those supporting him/her? Yes. But with such teamwork, it reduces the chances of such a thing, and builds a sense of teamwork.<br>
<br>
/flame incoming...<br>
<br>
Before you people start bashing a player evolved way of working together for one of the most contested and fought over spawns, I suggest you spend a week helping out these clerics to see what it is like. Spend 36 hours awake selflessly helping to keep the cleric sane (many friends did this without any expectations of anything in return) before you open your mouth about something you have no idea about. <br>
<br>
Don't taint this show of solidarity between clerics with past events and the &quot;rules&quot; and your own worthless opinion of something you know nothing of. <br>

Acturian.. that's what I'm saying.. a shaman can keep a tank healed a lot longer than a cleric.. least a 60 shammy can.... he doesn't do a cheal, but you would be amazed how long a shammy can keep mana going with torpor/cann<br>
<br>
<br>
Whytspirit summed it up best... after a given camping cleric gets the spawn, it's up to the others that want the next spawn to work it out honorably.... that does not automatically mean next on a player-made list... <br>
<br>
Q-man (not gonna spell that on memory) seems to have the attitude that helped break the old QQ system, I'm not sure if  he was around back in those days.  One of the big factors in it's folding was when the reservation committe started taking itself as an authority.  The old &quot;why should Vis/LC be treated different than anyone else under the system&quot; argument that didn't really work since the guilds chose not to be part of the system.  The first thing I suggested as part of that committe when Vis started farming Trak/Venril was suggest we (the guilds that used the reservation system) work out a collective deal with Vis to share spawns.  It was shot down immediately, and IMO accellerated the eventual shut down of the system. <br>
<br>
If a Wraith cleric decides its' time to get into teh ragefire camp, the only rule I'm going to stress for them is for them not to be an ahole.. respect an existing camp and be civil.  If he wishes even help out the existing camp... and when that camp is done, be fair and reasonable when determining who is up next... that doesn't mean they have to get at the end of an 8+ long line of clerics most of whom are likely to not even be there at the time of the current Ragefire going down.  They could choose to do that, but if they don't that doesn't make them the bad guys.  It also doesn't mean demand to be next and berate what you guys are doing... both sides need to be civil and understanding of each other..  a guild that has no need of a buddy system to camp ragefire is not obligated to defer to one... and a collection of guilds working together in an organized fasion is certainly something to be given due respect... <br>
<br>
My own opinion is if the waiting list isn't too severe, it's an advantage even for a top end guild to use the list... it takes a lot of the burden off of the guild, who is usually kept plenty busy with this raid or that.. and lets the cleric raid with the guild while he has a spot secure.  <br>

I was pissed when I posted.  All I'm sayin is that a bunch of clerics banded together and are working together to get their epics.  Then someone posts here and people start posting negative stuff about it.<br>
<br>
We all know the rules... and we also know how meaningless they are.  Verant doesnt respect camps?  Hmmmm... I seem to recall that the GMs have forced a rotation in NToV.  Sounds like a camp to me... AND one that's not only GM supported... but GM enforced.<br>
<br>
Point is that some clerics are working together, and they are not being Elitist... they're just being nice to each other.  For once, it'd be nice to support these clerics... rather than put them down, and criticize 'em.  <br>
<br>
People complain about the &quot;horrors&quot; of the reservation systems.  Sorry folks... not the same... not by a long shot.  The Planes Reservation System crashed because the people running it couldnt/wouldnt take into account the uber guilds who only wanted Inny/CT.  There was also the talk of favortism.  Well... so far I wont comment on favortism... cause I havent seen any.  The Uber problem isnt a problem, cause it's only for a single mob... nothing more.  And as far as the wait goes, people are gonna have to wait anyway... so you might as well wait in line and play nice.<br>
<br>
And yeah... I know that there are those who dont care or agree.  But to those folks, STFU.  Keep your negativity to yourselves, cause you're tainting a good thing. <p><center>

I guess what irritates me the most is that how well or how poorly one plays their class has absolutely no bearing of if/when they will ever ever get an epic.  The other thing that seems to make little sense is how verant chose to make the quests difficult.  Make no mistake, I'm in agreement that the epic quests should have some degree of difficulty, but the most difficult part with the majority of them is simply waiting on a spawn.  Seems that should be the easy part.<br>
<br>
There are several reasons my cleric will most likely never see one.  The first and foremost is I don't have a week of vacation I'm willing to take from work to sit in a zone and hope something spawns, and if it does spawn hope I get it before someone else does.  Taking a week off from work and playing my character in shifts with someone I trust so I am &quot;camping&quot; it 24/7 just ain't gonna happen.  The good thing is my cleric is already level 56, so I can already 96% rez.  Seems a better effect would have been chosen.  I was always under the impression that a cleric's main objective was to keep folks alive, not be there to tend to them when they are dead.  That's what necros are for.<br>
<br>
Tons of other things generally wrong with the epic quests, but I bet ya'll already knew that.<br>

If you engage Ragefire with a Warrior and Cleric only... That is NOT sufficient force for Ragefire. A GM will say the spawn is NOT YOURS unless you have sufficient force. This stops someone for kiting a mob around for hours in hopes of getting people there.<br>

If a Raid is there with sufficient force, then the GM will default that raid with the spawn.<br>

<br>
Thats true, but I can remember a time a friend of mine camped his epic mob, and another guild came in wanting it. He engaged the mob, kited him around waiting for a few more people to zone in. The other force petitioned and guess what. THE GM Awarded the mob to the other force, because they were there SECOND but had &quot;SUFFICIENT FORCE&quot; at the time.<br>
<br>
Because of things like that (Even though he got sufficient force to the zone AFTER the other guild, he still lost out to the GM's ruling). This has happened more times than just this case.<br>
<br>
Unless the GM change their attitude, the rules will remain as follows :<br>
<br>
A group of individuals who are in the zone with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SUFFICIENT FORCE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> shall have the mob first, regardless on who aggroed first.<br>
<br>
Example.<br>
<br>
Cleric (a) camping solo for 5 days and rage pops... Calls for help.<br>
<br>
X Guild shows up with their cleric (b) (Has sufficient force) (First in the zone with Sufficient force).<br>
<br>
Cleric (a) petitions.<br>
<br>
GM shows up and WILL AWARD Ragefire to Cleric (b) FIRST because he was in the zone with SUFFICIENT FORCE FIRST.<br>
<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
I'm not saying its right, but it's the rules we must live by. Just like the ruling on camps. There is no such thing as a camp. If you've been sitting waiting for something, a GM WILL Rule that you can NOT monopolize a spawn and therefore you WILL HAVE to share. <br>

Seeing as you're the strongest advocate of The Rules, I'm directing this reply to you.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to talk about history. Hope that folks don't assume what occurs in the past is always the 'right' way to go forwards.<br>
<br>
Wrt your scenario. The whole point of the list, is that even if the cleric first on the list doesn't have the forces available immediately, what's so wrong with A_guild_01 helping that cleric out with the kill? Kudos to them.<br>
<br>
Is it so bad to help each other out? Or, the fact we play a game means we're bound by what Verant states as law?<br>
<br>
Taking in the bigger picture, yes it's a camp. But it's no ghoul frenzy. No it can't be monopolised, but yes a list can be agreed on.<br>
<br>
As long as everyone commits to helping out (whether it's joining in the fight, or not moving in to take the kill and loot it) those sitting in SF right now and in the future, this will work. <br>
<br>

<br>
Now lets look at human nature.<br>
<br>
80% of them will help you out, and respect people who's been camping something for hours or days at end. And these people will respect a cleric who's been camping ragefire for days.<br>
<br>
20% of them wont.<br>
<br>
Those 20 percent of the people will take advantage of situations, KS, steal, cheat etc. I consistently see MOTD's about GMs warning people against others. (Like trades for example). <br>
<br>
Because of those 20 percent of the people out there, you have to strictly play by the rules so that a GM will take your side in a issue. <br>
<br>
This reminds me when I was level 50 or so. Was in Kael with 2 groups camping the Manor. In comes another group saying You got to share now (even though we were there for a couple hours). Lord and behold a GM told us we had our time there, now we must give it up for them. If we didn't like the GM's decision then we would get a warning posted against our accounts. In light of this we left the zone upset.<br>
<br>
If you read my posts, I said I don't necessarily aggree with what the GMs are doing, but we gotta play by their rules. If we don't play by the GM's rules we get warnings posted against our accounts, suspensions or bans. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugurunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurunt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/30/02 11:25:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Waiting List?</span><hr size=1> <br>
Just a note:  The GM's have never enforced any rotations.  They have on individual instances said.. ok guild A gets it this time, but guild A will sit out the next spawn so guild B can get a turn next time without conflicting with guild A.  In all honesty, I can't even say if the gm's follow up on this the next week... it's just one of the ways GM's lay down the law so to speak when 2 guilds are incapable of working something out in a civil manner.<br>
<br>
The ongoing ntov rotation is/was worked out between the guilds involved.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uacturian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Acturian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/30/02 11:47:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Waiting List?</span><hr size=1> Gurunt, Volumnia tanked in Halls of Testing for 6 minutes when we had to camp a cleric , they camped and came back and she was still at it. we camped them again and ordered her to give it up and DIE! lol.<br>

<br>
Haveing a /log turned on while your tank/shaman fight human ragefire for a hour while your forces build won't hold water to a gm if your trying to show a ks.<br>
<br>
This is no different from 'kiting' the human ragefire while your forces get there.<br>
<br>
And a GM WILL as he did in the PREVIOUS ragefire 'kiting' incident tell you that 'sufficient' force is needed not first attack.<br>
<br>
/shrug I've been there for 7 Ragefire kills since the patch that put him in SF, helped camped 3 of them and one the entire 6 days.  <br>
<br>
And yes, on one of them, a GM forced a roll between two competing cleric or would have 'despawned' ragefire if one would have ganked the mob.  /shrug, couple of shitty rolls there =p<br>
<br>
Yes, it did have a very rocky start but the clerics seemed to have taken it upon themselves to work out a system that works about the best way possible.  kudo's to them.<br>
<br>
I've also seen a LOT of assistance from the GUBAH guilds that people seem to trash a lot.  So, for the most part, the system is showing that it can work.  I would also suggest that people who don't know jack about the help these guilds have given others to stfu about them. <br>
<br>
The only change I'd like to see is that the &quot;list&quot; if its going to be published.  Publish it on the QC forum and not an organization forum.  Then it might seem more accessable to clerics as a general rule then just members of that organization.<br>
<br>
Hell, if a cleric can't find their server board to sign up for the list then maybe they just aren't willing to work hard enough for their epic.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure one of the fine moderators here could update the list once a week and keep it current as well.  Not like they have anything else to do =p<br>

2 wrongs does not make a right.  Simply cause some ass's choose to, what is in my mind, ks Rage does not make it right.  You simply consider the source and do it again.  This is a sick rule/spawn timer on VI's part, it is for us to rise ubove this stupidity.  Not go with it. If they really wanted to make this they way the claim they wanted it would be a real random spawn, in multi zones.  So no one could camp it.  When he spawned he could shout his presense and the the rush to lill would be on.  As it stands now, we have to figure out a better way and as far as I can see this is the best idea so far. <p><html>

<br>
Fact is, this board is seen by relatively few of the Quellious population.<br>
<br>
What you folks have is, a collection of guilds willing to help each other secure and camp the Ragefire spawn, and an open invitation for others to sign on and help and secure their own spot in that rotation.  That is very commendable and it's a great thing to have.  It will cut down on the conflicts with the camp.<br>
<br>
It will not end them.  <br>
<br>
What you do not have, is any form of authority over the mob.  You do not have a system that is across the board 'fair' to the general clerics of the server.  They have to know about it, and anyone that knows about it now and has a reserved spot has a leg up on anyone that just hears about it and is then expected to go to the back of a huge list.<br>
<br>
What if 6 other guilds outside of yours set up their own rotation, thier own 10 player long list,  and expected your folks get in on the tail end of theirs?   <br>
<br>
That's my point... I don't want to see a cleric in a guild  fully capapble of this camp on thier own, who may not even know your list exists until you pitch it to them in SF, to be branded as the great evil for wanting to work outside of your system.  If they storm in, call you gimps and try to muscle you out in the middle of a camp, then yah, they're being retards... but if they wait for the current camp to conclude, then want to take over... are you going to a) concede happily   b) negotiate   c) leave and spam the flame boards  d) fight to the bitter end till a gm has to intervene....<br>
<br>
This leads into Gerwood's point... nobody, not Ketel, Gerwood, me..nobody ... is threatening to upstage you or ridiculing what you are doing.... Gerwood is stating the obvious... somebody WILL try to upstage you at some point.. be it out of spite, lack of knowledge, whatever... ragefire is a mob MANY guilds you and I probably barely even recognize can kill in house if they have half decent turnout. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugurunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurunt</A> at: 5/30/02 5:42:54 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=654.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=654.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=654.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=654.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=654.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=654.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=654.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=654.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=654.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=654.topic&start=201&stop=206>11</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=654.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=654.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=654.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.threadControl?topicID=654.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=654.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=654.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm11">Private Discussion <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm12">Posts Moved</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1>General</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
