<br>
Gaelron:<br>
&quot;And how long have you been playing anyway? You remember the pre-velious Vis?&quot;<br>
<br>
I started playing EQ a couple weeks after Quellious opened.  I picked Quellious because it was the least populated server.<br>
<br>
&quot;now there was a guild you didn't want to mess with.. Where a lot of the hatred started but again thats a long time ago people change and guilds change&quot;<br>
<br>
Good point.  Unfortunately, this was the formation of their reputation for many long-time players such as myself.  It is no easy task to reshape a reputation that has been severely tarnished.<br>
<br>
&quot;Again lets stop this stupid guild hate.. Im getting rather tired of posting on it..&quot;<br>
<br>
I know, it is pretty childish, yet amusing.  If one does not like this thread, one can avoid it.  The only reason I made it was because of a few outspoken members acting immature and telling me I should make a VM-hating post, so I did.<br>
<br>
Camdin:<br>
&quot;Is it just me or is everyone on both sides making posts cause they got nothing better to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, that would explain a lot in my situation <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I spent spring break in Princeton, where it was so cold I had to stay inside much of the day, basically bored.  I'm from Florida, so not very accustomed to 35 degree weather with wind.<br>
<br>
&quot;Every guild has people that are abrasive or just can not seem to play with others well.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am going to have to disagree with you there.  Two guilds strike me offhand as people who have always, always been gracious and courteous: Healers United and Council of Arcana.  They have both been around for a long time, and I've had absolutely nothing but enjoyable experiences with their members.<br>
<br>
A problem with a guild's reputation does not arise from a single bad apple.  Rather, it is from repeated instances of inappropriate behavior by a (seeming) majority of it's population, observed by groups of neutral or antagonist parties.  This has been the case for VM the past two years. Yes, I do have a few friends who joined Vis - Gorce, Mugen .. think that's it -- but that does not change an entire reputation.<br>
<br>
On this board, I apparently stand as a lone voice speaking out in opposition to the guild Vis Maior.  Keep in mind that about 1% of the server population actually posts here.  I am not alone in my opinion.  I cannot tell you how many group and ex-guild conversations I've heard of people flipping out because of something a VM member had just done to piss them off.  Yes, post-Velious.<br>
<br>
VM guys, you can take this as an insult, or you can take this as a challenge to work on your public relations.  The choice is yours.  If you want to keep attacking me on this little board, whatever~ I think it's funny.<br>
<br>
I need a hug.<br>

<br>
I havent been in Vis in over 8 months. Stylee, but since you threw my name in there. I'll go ahead and play along. <br>
<br>
This is Chikkin if you havent figured it out. Also known as Turkee, and Dook to a few friends who knew me '99.. <br>
<br>
I would never ask someone to res me in Sro or Oasis. Offer them money, and then not pay. I would never offer so much money for a res. The tightest spot I was ever in for a res to Chikkin, was deep in that kunark zone where you finish SK epic..with the reavers. And in that case Wraith people ended up finding me a port and res, since no vis were on that early in the morn. <br>
<br>
Its funny my name got mentioned here. A long time ago, shortly after I left Descent, and before I joined Vis, I wrote a long post here, talking about what great people Lotus, Descent, Wraith, and Vis were. Cuz they're all damn good people. <br>
<br>
Now to defend these good folks you alienated.<br>
<br>
Tipu was always a real laid back, easy going, mellow funny guy. If you thot otherwise of him, you never knew him. <br>
<br>
Tanja. If you've ever been guilded with Tanja, you'd realize what an honor it is. She's not only a brilliant bard, but one of the most funniest, and amusing people you could play the game with. You'll be in a bad mood about something, and out of nowhere Tanja will say something totally off the wall and make you laugh. She's that kind of gal. <br>
<br>
Occy/Ziggen is the one you were thinking of as a guild leader. Occy definitely wasnt the most popular guy on the server, but I can tell you from the many tells I shared with him late at night, that he was definitely a good guy. Occy in general would pay no mind to you if you didnt have &lt;Vis Maior&gt; over your head, but once you got in the family, he took care of you, and he was like your big brother. I dont know how better to describe the man. A great leader, in the fact that he &quot;got crap done.&quot;<br>
<br>
Clarissia and her helmet? lol, she was simply being silly. Her and Poper got so many tells about their helmets, you really just dont know. You know infact, if you took 5 mins out of your time to get to know any one of these people, you'd really find out what great people they are. <br>
<br>
<br>
There are such wonderful people in Vis, and many who dont even play anymore. I dont care what timeperiod of Vis Maior you're talking about, the guild itself is something special, and I'm sorry you've never had the chance to experience being a member of it. <br>
<br>
The same applies to Lotus Cult, and any other long standing guild who have many veterans and a wonderful, long, and memorable history/past to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Gaelron, I find it amusing you have anything Pro-Vis to say. You spent so much of your freetime trolling the boards on Vis, giving us a hard time. Perhaps you've had a change of heart, and I know you're not a bad guy, but since when do you have anything &quot;decent&quot; to say about Vis? Hah... <br>

P.S. If you wanna flame any Vis members, and get a complete agreement from everybody on the server, including members of Vis, focus all your hate on Mohogany. I'll be right there to agree and back you up Stylee. <br>

<br>
Yes i have good things to say about Vis but that name still doesnt feel right with me.. But i don't hate anymore.. Time heals the wounds..<br>
<br>
That being said I would never join Vis or attempt to but i may raid with them if they needed another wizard.. I respect their abilites as one of the top if not the the guilds on quellious and maybe EQ.. That is undeniable<br>
<br>
Still everyday I hear negative things about Vis.. i just ignore them now.. hate is unhealthy.. Vis really hasnt done anything to make me mad in months so I don't have a good reason to hate.. They are just doing what they need to to maintain their guild.<br>
<br>
And a correction.. I didnt troll Vis boards like that.. Was just reading important posts (still do that) <br>
I only made about 4 posts on Vis' site and 2 of those were negative.. <br>
<br>
Lauriston thx for the compliment (i think) but you are right people still dislike Vis for those days even though a lot of the people who played in those days are gone.. Its word of mouth that spread this all around.. New people who logged in and got into guild with new friends and all that anti-Vis talk that warped their minds even though Vis did absolutely nothing to them..<br>
<br>
Again Im not saying its wrong to hate guilds but have a good reason to.. Rumors is not and how other people feel is not a good reason to hate.. Make up your own damn mind..<br>
<br>
How exactly could I hate a guild anyway with so many ex-guildmates that have been good to the guilds i've been in and good to me..<br>
<br>
Stylee drop the hate.. Just cause someone trains you once doesnt mean they are bad<br>

Like I said before you were nothing but a thorn in peoples' side w/ your pathetic excuse for talent to a class you played so long. <br>

   You can stop trying to get me a bad rep or whatever you're trying to do, b/c I always help people. Ask the random people I res, or heal to save em. (ask this one wizard I res'd like 4 times at once b/c rockfiends camped the zone in the grey). Ask the level 1 paladins who tell me randomly about good starting tips for the class. Sorry man, but I'm nice and help out to everybody I can in my limits. And yes I do have some bad days where I act like a dick in eq but I'm only human. Please stop coming here and attacking me for whatever grudge you hold. On side note...Tipu was one of the nicest people on the server and yeah sometimes he wasnt perfect but who is. On ppl who ks/train, I dont care, I cant stop them, and we have no need to work on our public relations to a @#%$ ass of a gimp you are.<br>

To gurunt if I spelled that right....8-11 ppl sitting at zone in ST isnt a raid so not sure how you justify that as jumping/running over a raid...btw I was there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uhavusin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Havusin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Message Board Whore</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(3/16/02 11:15:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=219.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Coiiin baaaaaaahhhhhd</span><hr size=1> *Laughs* Oh I'm still here Chik, still making the message board rounds to start my days off.<br>

Thing is, everyone has off days, even the nicest people on this server.  And even the biggest asses have their rare moments of civility.  If you want to form opinions because of one instance, or make an assumption of an entire guild because of the actions of one person, or make a huuuge ordeal out of trivial encounters, by all means, go ahead. Its your 10 bucks a month.  I shudder to think of how you must deal with &quot;real&quot; problems if such in game fallacies give you such &quot;issues&quot;.<br>
<br>
You play for long enough and you will probably have a bad run in with someone in each and every guild. I mean, I would like to think of myself as a pretty nice guy, but I remember back in the day when I thought it was a cleric's JOB to rez people that asked. I was anti-anon/role and just fielded tells all day long.  So when I would log on and immediately get 10-11 tells, I may not have been all that nice to that 11th guy that dies in OOT powerleveling on sister isle.  <br>
<br>
I bet 90% of the issues that people have with others, especially the crap that tends to be &quot;vocalized&quot; so to say on message boards is nothing more than hypocracy regurgitated from narrow minded individuals that dont take the time to be the least bit insightful about maybe WHY someone does not want to hear the 118th joke about their helmet, or maybe, said person was kidding around, being a smartass, or hungover...ya never know.<br>

<br>
You got me to post on page 3 dammit, pretty much breaking my own rule.  Once you hit the third page on these boards, you could type a cure for hunger up here and it would get skimmed right over.  Thats why I typically try to find a picture to say what needs to be said, but most of the ones I found to sum up my feelings here I didnt want to post out of respect for those that read the site at work. Not to mention I spent 10 minutes looking for a picture of poo on a plate to make fun on Mont's sig.<br>

As for the rez for 3k thing, I will doublecheck with my friend, but usually when that happens to people, they don't forget the name.<br>
<br>
You mentioned things like, &quot;If only I had taken 5 minutes to get to know Clarissia&quot; etc etc ... well, if she would have actually responded to me maybe I could have.  Yes I did meet Clarrissia again months after this incident I referred to. It was at an Ixiblat all-day killing spree for Jeaanie and various others.  Clarissia wasn't in Vis, I was now level 60, and somehow she is now polite to me .... not sure what to make of that.<br>

Yah of course all the people i defended were vis People, Hello? Isnt that who you were crashing on? Why the hell do i need to defend Wraith people? You werent talking to them? Do you want me to sit here and write good things about everybody I know in all guilds? I most certainly can if you want, and ask others who've known me, i can definitely get long-winded if thats what you want. <br>
<br>
Hell, i just scrolled back to see if I could see your guild tag, and tell you what people in your guild I know and am friends with, but I dont see a guild tag <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And dont forget, all these Vis people use to be in small guilds at one time or another. You think they all of the sudden became jerks the day &lt;Vis Maior&gt; came over their head? Like a magical spell? lol right. It never mattered if i had &lt;Nomad Souls&gt;, &lt;Descent&gt;, or &lt;Vis Maior&gt; over my head, I always acted the same. <br>
<br>
I was telilng a friend about your story today, and its funny, was my closest friend in the game, who happens to be a 60 cleric, (other than Havusin :P), and I was telling Nida &quot;Whats so funny about his story, is that if that ever really happened, I'd just get you to res me Nida :P&quot; I wore Full bronze man, I dont think i ever had 3k to my name. <br>
<br>
If you want, you could always tell me the name of your cleric friend, and i would straighten it out with them in-game.

<br>
There was just a simple reason for this and that he didnt level with me about his intentions, so he let me gather a raid force and he went passed me anyway.  <br>
<br>
This just comes down to communication, nothing more nothing less.  If he would have said, this is what we are doing....no questions asked, I would have respected him for it and stepped to one side.  <br>
<br>
Instead, it begun a war of words which is now over and done with.<br>
<br>
...so yes, I have flamed Vis or more specifically Occy for his lack of communication skills...but thats like one person in a whole guild.  <br>
<br>
Alliance of Arcana and Healers United, you have never had a problem with them....neither have I.  I always thought Healers United were a very helpful guild, there again I have found all of the guilds on the server to be helpful in some way.  <br>
<br>
Thats not to say I havent met certain individuals who are a combination of dickheads, loot whores, immature, unreasonable clowns.<br>

No biggie, was as much our fault for not killing.  We've dropped Progenitor with 10 people.... *We* should have started killing rather than waiting for a few nonessential players to get their asses out of Droga *looks innocent*.<br>
