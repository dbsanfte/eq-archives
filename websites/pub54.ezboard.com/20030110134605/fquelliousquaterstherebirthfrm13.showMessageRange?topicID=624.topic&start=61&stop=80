<br>
Kailynn's post are intelligent.  Unfortunatly her statement and my motivation were the same.  The idea of 10,9,8 wasnt the formation of the thought it was an example of the expression.  The heart of my idea was that saying someone is a failed recruit cant be evidence of anything.  It doesnt say anything.  I didnt mischaracterize your post i enumerated the possible reasons and why they are bad.  You can pick one or provide another.<br>
<br>
Let me ask you this Del.  Why did you mention that the Wraith leadership were rejected by LC?   What idea was such a statement in support of?  Put this way: whats the reader supposed to glean from it.  Whats the point of writing it.  why bring it up?  What idea was it in support of?   <br>
<br>
Kailynn's ideas provide the only resonable basis to say it.  That at the heart of this isnt statements bout personality but statements bout relationships.  that there arnt any bad guys.  <br>
<br>
If your going to claim that..   BULLSHIT.  <br>
<br>
see you went above and beyond.  You said that wraith leadership were failed recruits of both LC and vis.  The truth is you said that they were failed recruits to prejudice the reader against them.  An ignorant thing to do.  I didnt mischaracterize you at all.  And your pissing on me and calling it rain if you think im going to believe you didnt say it to establish a negative context above and beyond failed relationships after that hate post that followed it.   <br>
<br>
You got to be fucking kidding me.  You used wraiths officers failed recruitment as a personal attack.  a flame.  Kailynn provided a basis that it might not be a flame which is valid but it sure the fuck doesnt apply to you deloras.<br>

I figured Explicit was the guild we had issues with /shrug. <br>
<br>
Why bother even dragging all this stuff up? All this accomplishes is to stir up hateful feelings on both sides. I won't be a part of it. I will neither defend or accuse any party speaking out in this manner since I wasn't present for all this ancient history. I am so sick of all this crap going on. It is not necessary to enjoy the game is it? We need to quit bashing each other and look toward our goals in game.<br>
<br>
I enjoy Wraith, been a while since I actually HAD fun with the guild I was in and didn't hide out on a twink to avoid the bullshit. It's not perfect, there are people I could live without seeing, but that is a fact of life in a large guild. I also have people I like in Lotus Cult. Since I have joined, I have yet to see Wraith/Reviv screw LC over in any way, and likewise. What's the big friggin deal? MOVE ON, don't y'all have some new content to explore?

<br>
My apologies... you did not understand what I wrote.  I will make it clearer.<br>
<br>
Kids (I don't care how many wrinkles you got you play and post like a 12 year old.. maybe it's roleplay) like you jump on the caboose of a huge guild and immediately pick on, bitch at, and denigrate others.<br>
<br>
There is no real issue between our guilds.  We've had conflicts over mobs that every guild has conflicts over.   <br>
<br>
Individuals like yourself who just do what your told by players like myself who strat and organize and negotiate,  feel that they own the server.  Anyone not doing what they want them to when they want them to are &quot;bad&quot;.<br>
<br>
You only play to be better than Wraith.  You said that exactly.  That is the problem.   That attitude.  I could care less what LC kills or doesn't kill.  I don't laugh when you fail Vulak (the hardest encounter in game pre PoP... many LC tell me Emp is harder than anything in VT, and Emp is cake compared to Ring of Vulak).. I was quite happy to see you guys kill Emp first on server, you'd been working at it for awhile.  I don't want to clear VT in order to bother you, I don't want to tackle PoP to bother you, or anyone.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Wraith has done nothing LC hasn't done.  We've been run over by LC, trained, attacked by the kids like yourself who get off on being superior at following orders.... but that's the game.   We don't hate LC for it, we work on keeping communication with your leaders to avoid the conflicts. <br>
<br>
 <br>
Two faced is as far from me as you can get.  I take my faults and my guild faults on the chin.   We aren't the white knighs on the server but we are no more tarnished than anyone else.  Nobody gets ahead or advances themselves in this game without causing friction with the other raiding crews. This is the high end game folks.. don't play it if you don't like it.<br>
<br>
Two faced would be demonizing others for doing  what you do yourself.   Or saying you only play to be better than others then try to convince people you aren't an ego-driven player.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I have a number of folks that will stick up for me in LC.  I don't know of anyone in Wraith or Reviv that feels the need to apologize to people for me.   I have accepted the apologies of your guildmates for you gracefully when they were given, Delores.  <br>
<br>
Again, in case you don't understand:<br>
<br>
The kids who only play to be better than others, that instigate and mudsling... whose ONLY contribution to their guild and the server is denigrating others are what keep fanning the flames.   <br>
<br>
Read this thread you can figure out who fits the bill.<br>

I think there is some deep seated dislike between some individuals. I liken it to the moral majority, they only appear to be a majority to some because they are so vocal. It is the same, it seems to me, with those who flame each other. They are not representative of the true majority of the members of Lotus and Wraith.<br>

Of course, thats just my opinion, I could be wrong.<br>

I think we on the Wraith/Reviv team have no problem viewing LC as the number one guild on the server in general. You have done some stuff before us and that's great.

No. Do all of your accomplishments make you better than us? No. Being number one by the criteria I use, it just makes you ahead of us in content. We are just now figuring out VT.

And Esmalyn, not sure what you are referring to, but Raalf posted in an honest attmept to see what the big deal was rather than dredging up all the crap that's come floating to the surface on this thread. Read the posts, obviously its not OUR chip, but also that of the majority of the others posting here. <br>

As far as it goes, I am not letting it get to ME on a personal level because I wasn't involved, and if people want to call me a zerger in Sebilis because of my tag, or give me grief because I am with Wraith, a guild I enjoy being in for the challenge and the adventure, I say fuck em. If I people are so narrow minded to judge me without knowing me, then I am better off without them and I can get along just fine with my guildies to entertain me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

However, I do appreciate the responses, from those who were able to state their opinion. Quoting each other was TOTALLY derailing the point here. I don't give a fuck who said what (read my FIRST fucking post, jesus), I merely was looking for personal insights as to why things are so edgy. <br>

When did we hold a taskmaster hostage in Basement when we clearly had the force to take Cursed when you didnt and we came in to kill?  Which happens to be exactly what you did with Eplicit later on (not holding TM hostage but racing them to the cycle when you had sufficient force and they did not) which I fully agree with Wraith on that one but I didnt say anything on that since I wasn't there and it wasn't my guilds issue.  When LC and Wraith/VM race its always because we dont feel you have sufficient numbers to kill the mob at the time.  Unlike some other guilds we dont zone in and start claiming a mob when another guild has sufficient force and is working their way to it.<br>

<br>
Sorry Gurunt we didnt FORCE anything on you as I am quite sure the fact that you disagreed proves.  We offered a perfectly fair and reasonable rotation that put LC LAST every single time he popped (until someone killed him).  You even agree with this.  I also dont feel offering Wraith a full guaranteed chance every Emp pop after we knew we could kill him and basically lock the spawn down forcing anything.  When you disagreed to our offer then we raced you to said mob.  Which is exactly what would have happened anyway.  We offer, you decline, we both do what would have happened if we never made the offer.  What is wrong with any of that?  On the other hand, declining and then accepting after we showed that we could and would race to Emp and that we weren't afraid to do just that, makes me wonder.  Funny though how we set up a rotation to be fair with you and VM that actually hurt us more than benefited us except in the same ways it benefited all 3 of our guilds.  Yes, we are so horrible for setting up rotations and agreements between our guilds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What is it with the guilds that think they kill a mob first they own it for the rest of time?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Haven't seen it on Quellious in a long time.  Though I do see a distinct attempt at making the high end game more reasonable and fair for all of the high end guilds by putting a rotation into effect (by agreement) so our relative guilds can actually go have fun instead of zone camping til the mob we want to kill spawns and preventing the need to race each other to important mobs.<br>

Hmm no, but you get <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>my</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ire when you try and skew things that we have done to improve the high end game for ALL of us and try and paint us as bad people and a bad guild for doing it.  As you try once more to do with that comment.<br>

Oooo.  An im better than you quote from Gurunt in the thread he is cutting people down for the same thing.  Grats Gurunt on being a hypocrit  Sorry Gurunt, but just because you say you strat organize and negotiate doesnt mean you're any better or really any different than anyone else who playes this game.  We all play for different reasons and enjoy playing this game in our own way.  <br>

No you dont.  Every time someone has posted something about what Wraith has done that was irrefutable you were usually there with a comment about how you weren't online at the time, or you couldnt talk to Biffins at the time, or that no one told you about any agreement, etc.  <br>

<br>
No she didnt.  She said she plays to win and to be the best.  Achieving that goal will mean Wraith would be second, if you want to rank high end guilds by what content they have defeated.  And you took that to mean she wanted to make everyone elses life miserable which she also didnt mean but once again thats how YOU took it.  If racing other guilds to spawns and beating them and killing a mob first for the first time on server is making people miserable then you must be making people pretty misreable then, especially in Explicit?  This is a game based around competition after all, it's just usually PvE competition.  It's players like us (as in those of us who enjoy posting here on this board, yes you add to it yourself Gurunt) with the big egos, and/or self pride that turn it into competition between players.  <br>
<br>
I also play to win and be the best.  Maybe in a different way than Delores and many others (ie Desaren/Tenalin).  For example i consider PvP and PvP ability meaningless especially on our server.  Hence why if they ever do another BotB tournament you will not see Kalynn there.  I dont deny PvP can be fun at times but it just holds no meaning to me.  <br>
<br>
Also if you had put a little more effort into actually trying to udnerstand what she wrote you'd see that she also said she was already thinking about staying not because of Wraith but because her friend who was quitting with her decided not to quit after all.<br>

Holy damn.  Desi do you even read what you write?  You just contradicted yourself in the same post not two paragraphs later.  But like I have posted on all the 'whos the best guild on your server' on the Safehouse and other baords (I do believe someone made a main forum thread on this board about this and I still answered like I do everywhere else), I dont feel that question can be answered adequately.  There is no 'top' guild imo.  Different guilds have different goals.  LC may have accomplished the most on server in the high end game to this date and surprised a lot of people in doing so, but VM still holds the most server firsts overall.  Wraith 2.0 (who I still consider not much different from Wraith 1.0 since it has a lot of the same people and officers and every guild goes through changes in whos in it anyway) has defenitely made up for lost ground the fastest.  Then leaving the high end game we have Healers United, what I consider the best group of people consolidated into one guild on the server.  So what's your criteria of 'the best'?<br>

They claim to be America's #1 pretzel.<br>

They are guaranteed fresh.<br>

The cheese they use is Cracker Barrel cheese.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>A Brief History of the Pretzel</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
in southern France and northern Italy, with attribution widely given to monks who are said to have prepared the first pretzel using leftover bread dough. &quot;Pretzels,&quot; from the Latin word &quot;pretiola,&quot; meaning little award, were given to children as rewards for reciting prayers. As the snack became popular in Austria and Germany, &quot;pretiola&quot; evolved to &quot;pretzel,&quot; and was brought to the United States when the Germans and Austrians immigrated to the United States.<br>
1861<br>
Julius Sturgis opened the first commercial pretzel bakery in the U.S. in Lititz, PA.<br>
<br>
1933<br>
First pretzel twisting machine was developed and produced 15,000 pretzels per hour.<br>
<br>
1961<br>
Frito-Lay purchased Rold Gold Foods from American Cone and Pretzel.<br>
