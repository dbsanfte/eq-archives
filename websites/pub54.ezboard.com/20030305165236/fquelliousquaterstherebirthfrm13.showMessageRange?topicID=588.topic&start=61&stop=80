<br>
I dunno much, but i know that the people i converse with in guildchat on a day to day basis are good folks.  We help each other out, and usually try to do whats best for others as well.  <br>
<br>
When you say we act superior over others that we have advantage over, i guess thats hard to see from my position, but i do know it seems only the nature of competition.  You wanna stay a leg up on those you are a leg up on.  There isn't any &quot;end of the game&quot; in EQ so no one ever really wins, but you do have power strugles, it sorta makes the game exciting.  All the shit talking on the messageboard is just an extension of that struggle, and all part of the game in my opinion.  Wraith never intentionally trains people, we never KS guilds, and we never go out to look for conflict.  If we get beat to something we leave, we may bitch about it, but we leave.  When we beat someone to something, or feel that we are in the right, we fight like alley cats to win...because its part of the fucking game!!<br>
<br>
If any of you take this game, or all the shit talking to heart...you need to step back and laugh, because its all part of the race...its part of the fun in my opinion...but then again, no one ever agree's with me...so i may be just a dumb fuck...YAY FOR ME!!<br>
<br>
<br>
About telling the truth...Everyone has their own truth Gimily.  Its the reason cops dont ever get 1 eye-witness and call it cased closed.  I see things in favor of wraith, Woow see's them in favor of Explicit, other folks see that one time their guildies friend that was in East Commons said that a Wraith members trained a Ghoul on them, so they see wraith in their own way.  In other words, everything that is said on these messageboards is all hearsay...its distorted versions of the truth, and i seriously doubt you will ever ever find exact facts on the flame boards...they are the flame boards for christ sake...facts are boring....Woow said we had 80 people in ssra, he/she knows we didnt have 80 people, but he was mad and exagerated.....the next dude that reads that...he wasn't there...he says...wtf wraith uses 80 people for rhag 1!!! everyone says wtf...omg i heard wraith had 80 people at orc1!!  and the shit snowballs from there...anyway...i guess i got the point across...but once again..im sure its nothing you dont already know...<br>
<br>
Fuck wraith...Fuck Explicit...fuck everyone...we are all sacks of shit...but..i happen to like my sack of shit...<br>

I've personally seen waif do all of these things.<br>
<br>
I think the key here is I have NO interest in any party concerned.  I am not biased because I honestly can't stand most of you in any of the high end guilds.  There are a few out there that I still talk to, but the term elitist snob applies to most of you in any of the &quot;big 3&quot; or 4 or 5 or whatever it is now.  Hell I was probably much the same during my tenure in LC, but lemme tell you this, things look a lot different from the other side.<br>
<br>
What I am saying and have said is purely based on my experiences with said guilds and my experience is that the only dependable thing in EQ is that waif will lie about it.  That's the bottom line as I see it. <p>Gimily Smashfist 60th Cleric (retired)<BR>Gimilly Smashfist 60th Warrior</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usephrokdapathfinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sephrok da Pathfinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tolapumj wanna-be</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/18/02 9:56:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTB planar rifts</span><hr size=1> I'd like to share a couple examples of where both Wraith &amp; Explicit have been generous... to hopefully open some eyes.. and realize maybe both guilds were in the wrong, no matter who did what first.. but i'm sure Explicit deserved being steam rolled, just as much as Wraith might have in the passed... for it to stop, you guys will need to overcome some ego's.. which is a hard thing to do.. but it can be done <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for lying and stuff, i know nothing about that, so im not going to comment on it.<br>
<br>
As for my examples..<br>
<br>
RIP was forming up in basement for Glyphed / Exiled / Cursed, Explicit just killed Rhag1, and also wanted the same mobs we did, they realized we were there first, via a line of communication between me and Shouja, and they backed down.  We returned that favor many times (altho some of which were quietly) Such as when they had &lt; 20 people in the basement (possibly even &lt;15, i dont remember) and RIP didn't even think about stepping foot down there to challenge them for it.. because respect is a 2-way street.<br>
<br>
Second example of Wraith's kindness:<br>
<br>
RIP, again, was forming up in basement for Glyphed / Exiled / Cursed... Waif comes in since it was their turn in the rotation, i believe, and me and Biffins talk it out.  He asks how long we expect to wait for our #'s to go up, i give him a reasonable time.. and we go on with our business.  They went and killed something in the mean time, then returned to Ssra as we were killing Glyphed.  They sat themselves in basement, waited to see whether we'd win or loose, and planned on actualy waiting for Taskmasters to repop (instead of taking our mob after we failed or something) should we have lost.<br>
<br>
So, we killed Glyphed.. engage Exiled and have a very very nasty fight, get him down to 5%, and we're barely hanging on, probably would have whiped... i ask Biffins if they'd help us finish Exiled off quick, and we'd gladly back off from Cursed for'em, he agrees, they help us finish off exiled quick.. and Biffins offers us a shot at cursed first.  (This would have been our first shot at Cursed)  Knowing that we probably would have whiped, or come very close to it without their help on Exiled, we held to what i originally /t'd him, and they took Cursed.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Both guilds can be nice, but unfortunetly you guys started off on the wrong foot regarding your rep between you 2... and your hate for each other was taken too far in the Tormax incident, where Explicit's &quot;reasons&quot; was that they hated wraith or something, so they bashed RIP in the process there...  (Sorry to beat on a dead horse btw regarding the tormax incident, just trying to get my pointless point across =p) <p><center>

I think it is awesome that you act with a level head in most situations...Rel In Por has my utmost respect because of that.  You guys kick ass!<br>
<br>
I remember back when you guys were coming up, and we sometimes had run in's on mobs, i used to think you were a punk, and just a big shit talker...i can see i was totaly wrong, and i guess this is an apology heh..even though i never told you that you were a punk.<br>
<br>
As far as explicit is concerned...it is no wonder that they get 0 fucking respect from wraith or wraith leadership...They have done nothing to deserve it, only things to make the respect less.  I believe in everyone starting on a level playing field.  I dont disrespect anyone or respect anyone i dont know.  From day 1 all i have ever seen explicit do was disrespect wraith in any and everyway possible, there for loosing the respect of damn near everyone in wraith now, even the optimists.  I would almost think, well maybe it is just us, but ive got friends (yes wow i do have friends!!!) in every high end guild on quell, and they all say the same shit, they are fucking tired of the bullshit.  After all the BS they talk about how they will fuck over wraith any chance they get...Woow making threats on the messageboards...Jakobb making threats in tells to memebers in game...why on gods earth would we EVER make ANY effort to be nice.  You guys wanna play like dicks...We play like dicks when it involves explicit.  Fact is, You guys lost at cursed, Lost again at HP last night, and then Lost again at Creator.  At creator you guys decided you were gonna make good on your threats and decided to train our attempt killing us, and yourselves in the process.  <br>
<br>
I know a good portion of most high end guilds cannot stand you guys and your methods.  You guys think you can have whatever you want, whenever you want it.  Well as you found out, you can't.  Blocking doors, trying to rush triggers for spawns, petioning GM's, Training other raiders, all that shit isn't working guys..so once again...grow the fuck up...<br>
<br>
You show respect, you get respect back...simple as that.  Regardless of how much LC might hate wraith, or VM might hate wraith, or RIP might hate wraith, we all have mutual respect, and dont fuck with each other on spawns. (usually).<br>
<br>
Gimily, you seem like a bitter person, but that is all good..im sure you have plenty of reasons.  Im new to the whole 'uber' guild scene, and ill be the first to admit, im a drama queen, and a n00b at times...but i know only what i experience, and, i suppose im biased, but the majority of wraith folks are outstanding people.  Ive been with wraith for 4 or 5 months now, and never seen ANY training, KSing, Greifing, of any kind perpetrated by wraith on anyone.  Maybe im just jaded...*shrug*<br>

This is the other big diff between Explicit and the other top guilds.<br>
<br>
When we (or LC, VIs, Rel) move for a mob.... we do so with immediate intent to kill.  When we see another of our peers are moving for a mob, we know they have the force to do it, right then... that is a big reason we don't have fights.  We don't spawn-race at the zone line, we move when we are ready.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cursed and Emperor are 2 exceptions to this because of the setup for Emp and the trigger cycle of cursed...  that is why we put them on rotation.<br>
<br>
We don't send 18 ppl to a mob to kill him later that evening, or to block other ppl who are more capable from doing him first, then claim it was a &quot;race&quot;.   That is not a race... that is one guild stalling and cockblocking another. <br>
<br>
We don't see another guild move to a mob we were thinking of with a full force then send less than 20 people up after them to run ahead and try to block doors.  <br>
<br>
We don't train the other guild who manage to squeeze enough people past our ogre-illusioned enchanters to engage the mob we still need to wait on ppl for.<br>
<br>
<br>
Explicit (and Salta and Gimily apparently) may condone all of that.  That's fine.  That's the game you LIKE.  Don't come here upset because YOU play that way and don't win every time.<br>
<br>
As far as  Cursed goes, folks (gimily, salta in particular)... I do remember wraith in basement with 30+ having been told by someone to leave because they didn't have enough.   Ugly fight there too.. But there were differences...<br>
<br>
1) we had 30+ at the start<br>
2) we had not killed triggers earlier to delay the spawn so more of our guys could log in<br>
3) we backed down rather than have a GM send us off<br>
4) the next day both sides talked and we were in the rotation <br>
<br>
<br>
All the big guilds have had scuffles.  All the guilds feel they are in the right for them, and the other guys are being elitist or jerks or whatever.   Explicit is the only one that seems to seek it out.. constantly escalate it...  <br>
<br>
Most any conflict between guilds I've seen has had gray area for both sides to point fingers.  The few I have seen that haven't:<br>
<br>
The Kael stunt with Rel (and Wraith who were actually first and defered)  that Explicit tried to steal<br>
<br>
The Ssra stunt where a full force moved up to HP to have less than 20 Explicit run THRU them to block and try to claim HP later that evening<br>
<br>
The Creator stunt..rinse and repeat for HP.  Only add training us when we engaged Creator.  (and to be fair you had almost 25 people this time)<br>
<br>
The most telling aspect of this... Explicit doesn't seem to want this to end, this is their preferred style, as they make 0 effort to end it.  They just start more fights, they have yet to try to play with/like the rest of the server yet.  <br>
<br>
Prove me wrong.   Please.  Nobody else wants to play this way. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

I don't condone anything any guild may or may not have done. As I said I am not a huge fan of Explicit either. I don't really give a shit what you guys do to cockblock each other. I'm just saying I don't believe a fucking word anyone from waif says just because of the character of the guild as a whole in just about every instance I've ever had a run in with them. Now you guys do have some great people. I really like Hallace for instance. Brudda also. Always enjoy grouping with them. But the character of the guild Wraith has never changed.

<br>
&lt;snaps out of it&gt;<br>
<br>
As far as explicit goes, I can only say, explicit has some weird attitude thing going on.  Maybe some old grudge or belief that makes them think wraithrev needs to suffer.  <br>
<br>
But  what I constantly see with them is this, and you can either believe me or, like explicit will do, think I am lying: wraithrev does not leapfrog guilds that are already clearing to mobs, nor does wraithrev try to claim mobs that another guild already has a superior force in zone.  We do not do this to any other guild, including the macho, he-man explicit.  Explicit does both of these things, however, at least with us.  <br>
<br>
Anyone ever been on a raid where a guild leapfrogs past you as you are on the way clearing toward a mob, and maybe even only a few mobs away from that mob?  (like last night on creator.  how lame, explicit, how very very lame).  Or, ever have a small grp of people try to rush to a room to claim a mob even though they have but a bare couple handfuls of players in zone?<br>
<br>
What is truly pathological about explicit, and these core players in the guild have been like this their entire time on quellious, is that they do things to people that, if they were done to them, they would be furious.  Technical name for that is: sociopath.  A sociopath hurts other people, but thinks, since it is not hurting them, everyone who is complaining about their actions is not making sense.  Jeff Dahmer could not understand what all the fuss was about.  After all, he didn't mind what he did, so what's everyone getting upset about?<br>
<br>
Explicit will continue to grow, because, sadly, sociopathy is attractive to some people.  They think it means &quot;being tough.&quot;  No, it means being a sociopath. Also, some people will buy into the core membership's storyline and believe explicit is always in the right.  But let me ask them this: when is leapfrogging past a guild ever right?<br>
<br>
Let me ask that again: when is leapfrogging past a guild ever right?<br>
<br>
Hint: &quot;But it's wraith&quot; is not a rational answer, mmkay?  That's like the answer that Osama tries to give when answering the question, &quot;when is it ever right to kill innocent people,&quot; except he says, &quot;when they are americans.&quot;  And before you think that's an inappropriate comparison, think closely about your own actions.  Hatred and sociopathy come is small and large sizes. <br>
<br>
Messing with other guilds as they try to raid is always wrong.  Here is something explicit has never understood: if you log in to a zone, and find another guild has significantly more people than you there, or is already more than halfway to the mob you want, LEAVE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.  That's what us non-sociopaths do.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your adolescent sociopathy explicit.  You so tough!!<br>

I do believe the &quot;misrepresentation&quot; to the GM is all hearsay.  How does someone from explicit know what was said in tells to the gm? If i ran into some level 20 druid in lake of ill omen and said, &quot;hey man, Salta from LC is a warrior with like 3000ac!!&quot; to that guy, salta is a warrior with 3000ac, but thats just what he percieved from hearsay!<br>
<br>
 i along with alot of other people, percieve Explicit to be fucking scum, or at least the people that were there the last couple of nights.  Hops not Hype might think Explicit are the coolest cats on the scratch'n post, because explicit hooked them up with free stuff, went out of their way to help them, etc....<br>

anyway...um..yea<br>

<br>
We were clearing to HP, had the people to take it...were getting coth set up for those on the way, when low and behold at the bottom of the coil up there we're over run by Wraith / Reviv. GM Brasse said they had more people so they get it. Big deal we leave.<br>
<br>
We go on to do Aow (yeah us!) and get word that XtC is up. Okay so we run there and pretty much run <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> with</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Wraith / Reviv to get there. Here's where it starts to get hazy because the sheer lag of having 100+ people in such a small spot was just amazing.<br>
<br>
From what I remember (and please flame me if I'm wrong) they trained us, we trained them...they rezzed, we rezzed...they engage XtC and we sat back and watched. They had melee on the adds as well as creator. And the ogre thing at the door, that was me (/bow)...and I did get bitched at because of it, won't happen again mkay.<br>
<br>
So, they wipe, adds kill us...somehow in all this a guide dies. So the guide comes back, gets his clothes back on (/whistle) and says we have to roll....which should have been done in the first place!!! So we roll, we win, we kill. End of story. Had we lost the role we would have left the zone...and come back another day. It's not like it will ever be the last time that the Creator spawned. There will be other chances...for us and for other guilds.<br>
<br>
I do my best not to judge someone because of the tag over their head, but some people are making it awfully difficult. There will always be the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> one</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> guild that everyone hates, for various reasons. Maybe right now it's because we're trying to build and grow and all that happy horsesh...well you know. I can remember a day when I typed /who all son of a bitch and came up with a certain guild. So I guess it's our turn to be the bad guys. All I can say ( to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> everyone</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ) is grow the f*ck up and remember it's a game. Yeah it's a little more then a game...we make friends and bonds and enemies...and we let it effect us in ways that no amount of pixels ever should. <br>

<br>
yeah right, i recall at least 5 times wraith leapfrog exp before last night and the cursed thingy.  I recall when I was in VM how wraithreviv tried to leapfrog KT from Rel and rel asked VM for help.  Btw, not only time either.  Everytime we tried to talk with wraith, biffins/grunt shut us off or just totally ignore us, and then run us over.  And afterward, desi just click his hotkey telling us, &quot;we don't think you guys have enough force so we decide to kill mob ourselves&quot;.  So everytime you ran us over, it's always our fault for not have enough.  Our usual raid number is in the 30s to 40s, it's nothing compare to wraitreviv--but that doesnt mean we dont have enough. And using the same excuss to run us over and over again is getting old.  Let's say if you have 60 ppl buffing for cursed, we suddenly show up with 100ppl and tell you to back down because we have more number, how will you feel? That's what your leaders have been doing to explicit past couple times we had run int.  I don't blame wraith member that their leaders are assholes and I feel sorry they have to deal with this kind of craps (maybe you have a diff view becoz your leaders keep lying to you). but no way I am backing down anymore.  Desi wants to play it dirty, he got it last night.  I hope he's happy.<br>
<br>
&quot;if you log in to a zone, and find another guild has significantly more people than you there, or is already more than halfway to the mob you want, LEAVE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO. &quot;<br>
<br>
No wonder you think wraithreviv never leapfrog other guild..coz there's no way a guild has significantly more ppl than wraithreviv....<br>
<br>
I talked to at least 2 wraith/reviv members last night after the conflict.  Bascially I told them I am sorry for what they have to deal with.  I am also sorry for posting craps like this in QC--i think this is the first time ever that i start a flame toward a guild. I dont think it's right, but I was mad.  so, too bad.  Anyway, I told them...I am willing to work with wraith/reviv, but only with someone I can trust, have a say in guild decision, and will show respect.  and I dont trust Desi/Droz and they never respect us--not that i respect them in any form, so i am guilty too.  Anyway, i dont want to get backstab and lied to again.  If you guys don't want to work it out. doesnt matter with us.  Just don't expect us to back off anymore like we used to.  Hope we made our statement very clear last night.<br>

So, you don't think Explicit deserved the spawn, you don't condone their actions, but you just wanted to mudsling?  Ok... my apologies for misrepresenting you as anything but a harmless pointless troll.<br>
 <br>
<br>
See the start of this thread.  You know damn well those are not the first 8 keys given out to people incapable of killing emperor, and  Wraith has given/sold exactly 0 VT key parts away.   Whether I think Vis earned thier 8 keys or not, it's up to the GM's to decide if they did something *wrong* or not.  I may think it weak, but I'm not losing sleep over it and I'm not out to bitch and moan at Vis and the server about it.  I petitioned, and that's that...if the GMs let them keep it or not,  I'm not losing sleep or picking fights about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
We didn't misrepresent anything, nor stall at all.... if Explicit hadn't stalled he'd have been dead a good hour sooner.  We moved in with intent to kill, not intent to wait, not intent to block another capable force.   <br>

<br>
are you denying that you guys last night followed us in as we cleared mobs on way to creator, then ran up the tube past us as we cleared the tube room?  Or are you admitting it?  Keep in mind, your case is not lost if you admit it.  You can always say that &quot;tough, we beat you to it by leapfrogging you, as you have done to us.&quot;<br>
<br>
But I have never been on a wraithrev raid where we leapfrogged another guild.  If we were to do so, I would log, since I don't play that way, and if ever you see me on a raid where that is happened, plz send me a tell, because I will tell the officers that I don't want to be a part of that kind of gameplay.<br>
<br>
I have been in wraithrev since May.  I have been one of the longest advocates of non-ffa gameplay, so I hope my word can count for something here.  You guys in explicit seem to be either grinding an axe by trying to mess with us, or you actually universally think tactics like leapfrogging are totally cool.  Either way, just admit what your approach is here.<br>
<br>
I will stand by my initial position: following another guild to a mob, then jumping past them at an opportune moment, is the lowest of the low.  Clearing to a mob is part of the definition of an encounter.  We were more than halfway cleared to creator when you all ran through us.  And are you denying that that is what explicit did last night?<br>
<br>
Plz let me know, wooowhatever, exactly what the dimensions of your self-delusions are here.  I need to know: have you convinced yourself you did not leapfrog, or have you convinced yourself you were justified in leapfrogging?  More stable minds want to know.<br>
