She escapes and goes to the police with the descriptions of the house and her assailants. The police, being the *cough* fair and  intelligent practitioners of justice that they are, recognize the description of the house as one belonging to the mother of a group of particularly nasty bastards. The police go and search the place, find evidence, and arrest the bastards (after some old-fashioned garden hose whippings) for their crime. They're locked away in prison for the maximum sentence- and because they're rapists, they're going to enjoy every day of it as someone's jizz receptacle.<br>
<br>
However, some friends of yours decide that this punishment just isn't enough. So they seek out the mother in whose house the brutal crime took place. And they're packing their broken-glass encrusted dildo for when they find her.<br>
<br>
Does this sound particularly fair? Cause that's what you're advocating, Daku. Bear in mind most of the Afghanis didn't want anything to do with the Taliban- and many of the soldiers were dragooned into service (similar to what happened in Iraq during Desert Storm). Are these people less than people because they had the misfortune of being born in Afghanistan?<br>

<br>
What I do object to is the idea that torturing is ok. The article (which I *did* read) states that they are Al-Qaida (we know these guys are scum) and -Taliban- soldiers. Taliban soldiers simply mean people armed and mobilized by the former government of Afghanistan. People who, it is entirely possible, were armed and mobilized against their will. <br>
<br>
Everyone in Vietnam was a Vietcong. Everyone knows that, right? Even the women and children at My Lai were. <br>

i agree with you that i couldnt give a rats ass on how these assholes of  the world are being treated...but i will however say something about what you said with regards to America saving the the world in 2nd world war.  If i am not mistaken America   did not enter WW2 until attacked by Japan 1 1/2 years into it.  They sat  back and didnt lift a finger until it affected them directly and i dare say  if japan hadn't attacked, all of Europe would be talking German right now.  To say America is all goodness and holy virtue and saving the world is very naive.  Don't get me wrong  i like Americans and what you yanks stand for as it's very similar to Australians but unless pushed you guys are pretty appathetic in the way you do it.<br>
<br>
p.s.  dont forget not all of islam and muslims are like that...but these taliban and Al Queda are the scum of the earth and deserve what they get.<br>

<br>
Having read a LOT of history from the time period from various different nationalities' versions of the war, and having talked to grandparents who were around at the time (including visits to concentration camps on the part of two of them), I strongly doubt I'd be speaking German now anyway. It would have taken a lot longer, but the main things that won back Europe were the RAF establishing &amp; maintaining supreme air superiority and absolute madness on the part of Germany in invading Russia at the start of a Russian winter *shrug*. If I were to be speaking anything other than English right now, I reckon it'd be Russian.<br>
<br>
If anyone owes anyone anything around here, you Yanks owe us quite a few chests of tea, centuries of years of tax, and an apology from Hollywood for some of the things they now seem to claim you did during the war in question (including that abomination of a film about the ENIGMA cipher). <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Okay, so I've gotten fairly tongue in cheek towards the end.. the point is that the Euro claims made are offensive to a lot of people this side of the water, I think..<br>
<br>
As to the prisoners.. I personally think it's totally out of order that the US and Brit morons who were caught fighting for the Taliban aren't being treated in the same manner as the rest, but instead may well be returned home for civil trials. I'm not going near the morality of the way they are actually being treated, since here in the UK we have no unbiased coverage on which I can form an opinion. The media seem to be blatantly ignoring large chunks of fact to get the point they want made across, even more so than usual for here.<br>
<br>
It's also interesting to note that no visible coverage at all was made in the British media of the large number of Royal Marines who recently returned after a stint over there as replacement troops were cycled in, whilst we're currently bombarded by pictures of the captured foreign troops. One of whom (even with the security procedures that people are complaining about) is alleged to have savagely bitten one of the guards.<br>

But outta curiousity, why are we risking not only the world's ire by holding the prisoners ourselves?  Hand them over to the U.N., U.K., or any of our other allies in this who are less* likely to take 9-11 personally to await trial.

Mostly the Brits.  I meant no disrespect to the efforts you made against the forces of evil during the last 100 years.  I wasn't saying you didn't give it your all.  You certainly did.   (Those cheese-eating surrender-monkey French, however, are still on my &quot;no rez&quot; list. )  But without such events such as the US supplying destroyers and smaller fast warships (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq59-23.htm)">www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq59-23.htm)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> to protect the sealanes supplying Britain with supplies, y'all were awfully close to going under.  Stopping the German Operation Sea Lion was crucial to your immediate survival but that did not guarantee your long-term one - those U-boats were wrecking the shipping lanes.  <br>
<br>
I was merely commenting on the fact that *criticism* of what America is doing against the forces of terrorism should be curbed.  I'm not saying that there is no torture going on. Hell, I hope there is.  I'm just commenting on the fact that the REST of the world should STFU and STFD because *no one* out there is innocent.  Britain has their Bloody Sunday and we have our own little dark secrets.  If our pundits criticized *your* government when that thing went down in Ireland, well they should have stopped poking their nose in your business and STFU and STFD too. <br>
<br>
Woo, regardless of whether or not Europe waited for the &quot;American supermen to save them&quot;, the fact remains that without American support, the odds were better than good that Germany would have eventually isolated and destroyed Great Britain.  There was no one else left to help them. <br>
<br>
Now, onto the folks who are drawing the Afghan people into this conversation.  Stop it.  I'm sure than most of the populace of that country were not aware what was going on.  Lots of them are definitely suffering for no good reason and that just plain sucks.  I'm talking about the folks who have declared a jihad on the Americans and our way of life.  I'm talking about those who raised weapons to our troops and our civilians.  They are the ones who need a little tune up with a switch out behind the woodshed.  And if that happens to break a few of the Geneva Convention codes... Good.  F*ck'em.  They gave up that right when they failed to hand over the terrorists and their supporters.  We made it painfully clear to their political leaders for a long time that we wanted the folks who did the dirty deed on Sept 11.  &quot;You want to harbor terrorists and support their way of life?  Fine.  That's your choice.  But don't send Mr Bush sad f*cking emails when a GBU Mk84 bomb sails through the window of your dirty clay hovel.  He doesn't wanna hear it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, Amnesty International does some very good deeds and some honest work.  But by the same token, they have to acknowledge that these are not the best years of our lives.  Extreme measures might be less the exception and more of the rule until we get a little bit more world order and teamwork on the global gridiron.  It's not the right time to start criticizing how the U.S. treat the prisoners who just a couple of months ago revolted while under more leniant prison rules and ended up killing many of their captors before being killed themselves. (Yes, you remember that event.)  The prisoners are extremists and will probably stop at nothing to harm their enemies. Thus the stricter policies.  &quot;Fool me once...&quot; I say.<br>
<br>
Laur, I'm not sure if your metaphor really depicts the spirit of my original post but I'll respond anyway. (Doesn't that broken glass-encrusted dildo now drop in Maiden's Eye? )  I was only referring to the prisoners-of-war being held in Gitmo and the folks criticizing (actually ostrasizing) our methods of detention.  I'm sure we aren't collecting all of the Afghan peoples and interring them.  We're just grabbing the folks who are firing heavy-calibre weapons at our troops and biting our guards.  Justifiable force I believe is the term best used to describe what's happening here.  (BTW.. your end-quote, from the Bible, is more recognized as SLJ's vocal prequel to his assassination of people in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  Not quite the most appropriate closing to your &quot;don't hurt the innocent&quot; diatribe.   But I digress...) <br>

Aspro, Hell, no.  America is not populated by virgins.  We're not saints.  I know that.  I'm no saint either.  But we did and still do help a LOTTA folks around the world and get very little if anything in return.  All I'm saying is... if you were starving and someone gave you free food when no one else would, shouldn't that person be one of the LAST on your list of &quot;people to @#%$ upon today&quot;?  If you're not perfect, then you shouldn't be squawking about the next guy.  'Nuff said.<br>

Shag, you're balls-on right.  It would have taken a LOT longer and the Germans screwed the pooch by attacking Russia. BUT there's a difference between having air superiority over Great Britain and having air superiority over your trade routes.  Hint: Think oil and rubber.  Anything coming around the horn of Africa or through the Meditteranean was at the mercy of the German navy.  Stick a few pocket battleships in the English shipping lanes with their 11&quot; guns and you'll see how willing merchant ship captains were willing to set sail at a blindingly fast pace of 8 or 9 knots.  No, England was not going to suffer defeat from the invasion of their land from the coast of France but that doesn't mean that they were well-to-do on their own either.  We'll never know because that's a &quot;what-if&quot; scenario - - but if you run the numbers and make even the safest assumptions, it didn't look good for England circa mid-1941.  And it wasn't getting any brighter.  And that line about the &quot;chest of tea and Hollywood&quot;... ahahahha.. THAT was good.  /hat's off.<br>
<br>
Zyon, no offense but... screw the UN.  They are a bunch of posturing, hollow blowhards who wrap themselves in their own political agendas and celebrity.   I've seen their ability to help world order (NOT!).  And I am rather unimpressed with their ability to simply be common citizens of the City (NYC that is), nevermind model citizens of the world.  If the fanatics who drove the planes into the WTC instead decided to veer 20 degrees to port and instead drive their planes into the UN Building (which, btw, is 1 block away from me) you would have seen a MUCH different reaction from the world-at-large.  You would have seen many governments come down on the Taliban like a bunch of 10-pound sledgehammers.  It's easy to play the critic when someone else is actually doing the work.   And I vote that we screw &quot;the world's ire&quot;.  Wanna see ire?  Go talk to someone who went to 6 funerals for dear friends.  In 4 days. That's ire.  Wanna see anger?  Let that person loose in that prison in Cuba.  Those prisoners in Gitmo should be THANKFUL they aren't being held in Riker's Island... they'd end up as blood clots splattered against the walls.  They want to be martyrs?  There are about 9 million people in NYC willing to help them achieve their goals.<br>

Good point by Cyl about the Government of Afghanistan being the problem, not the people.  In the USA, many people don't realize (are ignorant of) the fact that much of the world's population doesn't enjoy the same freedoms, liberties, and creature comforts that we American's take for granted every day.  Most people in the USA take a shower in and flush more clean water down the toilet than much of the world's population sees in a day, or a week.  I've been places like that.  <br>
<br>
The average Afghani isn't in a position to protest Jack.  Here in the US, if I don't like something the government does, I can walk down the street shouting or carrying a sign in protest.  In many third-world countries, a citizen would be dead within 5 minutes if they tried that.  <br>
<br>
However, those people going into the stockade aren't just Afghani citizens, they are people who fought for the Taliban or Al-Qaida. Now they are essentially in jail, awaiting a hearing.  I don't think that's outside the bounds of human rights.  Of all the places we could have put them, by themselves is about the safest.  <br>
<br>
As for Human Rights, while I won't claim the USA invented the concept, we did put it in our Declaration of Independence, and it was a pretty damned radical idea then that People have rights that are God granted, not government (king) granted.  What a concept!  If the rights aren't granted by the government, they cannot be taken away by the government in a just society.  (Ok, I don't want to get into due process, etc.  )  I'm all for Human Rights advocates as long as they don't go crying wolf.  <br>
<br>
As for the media, oh yes the media is liberally biased, and yes, a surprisingly large percentage of the media is influenced by Jewish people.  Certainly they have an agenda, but they aren't making it all up either.  As for Israel and land, much of Israel's expansion since 1948 has been in wars that they didn't even start!  Jerusalem was won as part of the six-day war, which was a surprise attack launched against Israel.  And they take darned good care of the land they own.  In an area where there were fewer than 15,000 trees when they arrived in 1948, there are now over 3,000,000 trees.  They also have given some land back.  I haven't seen anything to support that Israel's Law or Return is causing internal population pressures to aquire land.  Most of their current fighting is reactionary.   <br>
<br>
After having traveled to several other countries, some third-world, I can understand how they could see America as a fount of decadence.  We do live in the land of plenty.  However, I have seen so many people in small, poor countries, who see America as the land of plenty, and a wonderful thing to strive for.  Thankfully, while some of the world hates us, it tends to be due either to jealousy, or a fear that if we gain influence, we will help educate the populace, and an educated people are not easily controlled.  Why did Mao Tze Tung kill off all of the intellectuals and scholars?  Because they would be the ones able to debate the &quot;truths&quot; of communism.  Ignorant people will believe almost anything said with enough authority.  <br>

I didn't meant to say US didn't help in WWII at all.  I was trying to point out that US didn't do it alone.  US couldn't have won the war alone without the help from some other countries too.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you're not perfect, then you shouldn't be squawking about the next guy. 'Nuff said.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since nobody is perfect...guess everyone in the world should just mind their own business.  So...why do we have to keep sticking our nose to every single event in the world?  I don't think US is perfect in anyway.  If I remember correctly, US is, and has been one of the most out spoken country about human right--even prisoners.  How many time in the past US has help accuss other country of their way of treating their prisoners? I can't even count.  Rules are all good until others apply to us...and we say shamlessly, proudly---THEY STARTED IT FIRST THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE NO RIGHT.  O..also--WE HELPED YOU LONG LONG LONG LONG TIME AGO SO YOU SHOULD JUST STFU AND WATCH US BREAK THE RULES THAT WE FORCE OTHER PPL TO FOLLOW.  That doesnt sound convining to me.<br>
<br>
And Bush, i still can't believe he made some of his statements.  he said something like...you are either with us or with them. if you are not with us, you are with them.--can other country NOT with either side? afterall, it's none of their business at all.   That statement made me mad, made US look like a bully--not that we didnt look like one to a lot of countries before, but this just make it worst.  Afterall, we were trying to ask for helps from other countries.<br>
<br>
Afghan people....if everyone tells you the sky is black since you are born, you would think the sky is black too. That's how I look at them.  Blame the leader, not the ppl, not even the soldiers.  I dont think a soldier get much choice when a order is given--or he wouldn't be a soldier at all, he would be just another dead corpse.  <br>
<br>
&quot;But we did and still do help a LOTTA folks around the world and get very little if anything in return.&quot;<br>
<br>
Trust me, we get more than our share in return.  By helping other ppl in the world, by war, by supplying them stuff (whatever it is)--we helped our OWN economy (make you wonder why CA's econ increase whenever there's a war? =P). we raised our image to other countries. we get a lot of 'free passes' from other countries.<br>
<br>
This whole thing...i was mad and sad when NYC got attacked.  But after seeing how US deal with it and seeing how US ppl react, I am not so sure about it anymore.  Afghan terrorism kill US ppl. US soldiers kill Afghan ppl.  Afghan ppl cheered when US ppl get killed/attacked.  US people cheered when Afghan ppl get killed/attacked.  Finger pointing flying everywhere.  We are basically doing the same thing as them, and the best excuse we come up with is: THEY STARTED IT FIRST. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugurunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurunt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/24/02 3:20:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bleeding Heart Liberal &lt;--- Someone Call a Cleric</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
Otherwise, we could do ANYTHING and have no responsibility, train a fighter pilot, and sell him his own nuclear equipped bomber for a dollar, let him nuke some country we don't like, return home, and go &quot;The US didn't bomb you, BOB bombed you.  It was BOB, not us... he's not a soldier and he wasn't using our plane, it was HIS.   Bob is in Denver with his family, no, we won't extradite, nor commandeer his plane.  I don't know if he has any more nukes, but if you try and mess with him, remember he's a US citizen and we won't take kindly to that&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you kept up with the events you would also know Bush has said (paraphrased) &quot;I don't expect all of our allies to contribute equally&quot;.  It's not an issue of 'you must fight with us or we will kill you'.... it's a matter of 'if you are not doing what you can in your own region to be terrorist free, you are risking the US clearing out your terrorist problem for you'<br>
<br>
I'm anti war, pro peace; but I'm fully behind our actions against the terrorists and the Taliban.  I don't *want* to be at war, I don't even want the terrorists killed.  I want the WTC back, the thousands of dead back, or at LEAST steps taken as necessary to minimize the risk of an equivalent or worse event.  Can't have what was taken back, and the ONLY way to decrease the chance of another attack is to remove those that would do it.  We tried talking, and sanctions, and every other recourse.. this didn't start on 9/11, they've been killing us overseas and bombing our military for a decade.  When we let them kill hundreds of people with no consequence, it only makes SENSE for them to kill thousands... what are we supposed to expect if we let them kill thousands with no consequence?<br>
<br>
I don't believe in the only-victims mentality that seems to be prevalent in the peace activists seem to have.  If Daku punches me in the nose, I'm a victim.   The fact I was attemptign to rape his mother at the time is irrelevant, he hit me and I'm being hurt and mistreated!<br>

I wonder what people  feel about having police at all, or any kind of jucicial system/penal system, as MILLIONS of folks are currently incarcerated, their freedoms revoked, unable to live the lives they want.

Even if we captured Osama Bin Laden himself, no matter how much we may want to drive hot nails through his eyelids, we are in a country that recognizes that human beings have a right to not be treated with cruel or unusual punishment. After reading that article, I really can't say whether those prisoners are getting humane treatment or not, but it is certainly not ok to torture PoW's *pre-trial* in the name of &quot;payback.&quot; No amount of rhetoric in the world is going to make it alright for the United States to torture people. It doesn't matter that Osama and his men did not respect our rights, we still bear the responsibility of being a (supposedly) civilized nation, and *not* a terrorist organization, therefore, we are obligated to treat even prisoners of war in a humane fashion. <br>
<br>
Organizations like Amnesty International exist because sometimes we like to forget that certain people have rights. Maybe in America these people are afghani soldiers, in afghanistan they are women, in China they are political prisoners, etc. AI does not condone terrorism, they are against any inhumane acts upon any citizens of the world, including people who may or may not be associated with terrorism/Osama Bin Laden. Like it or not, part of what makes America the supposed bastion of freedom and goodness that we like to believe in is the fact that we do (supposedly)respect basic human rights, which sets us apart from many other countries in the world. So before you knock organizations like AI for trying to uphold those rights, imagine where the US would be without them.<br>

There has been absolutely NO evidence of any torture whatsoever.<br>
<br>
How do you define torture?  Being securely detained, and blindfolded?<br>
<br>
Being told that your job for the next two months is to watch over folks who will outnumber you 10 to one and have shown a willingness to martyr themselves in order to secure a weapon from guards to stage revolts?  To do this without securely restraining them, and being that poor guy in the picture there with the rifle having to walk by twenty or so prisoners?  <br>
<br>
There have only been what?  3 MAJOR revolts from taliban/al queda prisoners so far?  One of which went on for days and ended up killing hundreds.... I remember the bus incident first, the big one where we found mr Walker, and one other prison that had an uprising that was quelled a lot quicker....<br>
<br>
Yet ppl get thier panties bunched because of the restraints we are now putting on them when out in public?  There have been nothing even hinting at torture, or mistreatment outside of how we are sedating and securing them when they are being moved.... do you think MAYBE the fact these guys revolt every chance they get may be a factor here?<br>

I agree with this. But what about other countries?  Can't they just be not with either side? They should have a choice.  Siding with us may make them terrorists' next target.  They have to protect their own ppl and have their own interests too. They shouldnt be forced to side with us (that would be a stupid time to go against us, right?).  <br>
<br>
'if you are not doing what you can in your own region to be terrorist free, you are risking the US clearing out your terrorist problem for you'<br>
<br>
this is a bad statement too.  using this statement, you are basically giving US an excuse to send troops to ANY country we want--w/o the permition from the goverment of that country--just because we can...all we have to say is, &quot;we think there are terroroist in your country&quot;.<br>
<br>
War thing.  I still dont like it.  There must be some way to deal with things w/o starting a war.  It's just that most ppl think War is the only way to go w/o thinking of another possibility. O well, of coz...war makes good money for US too...<br>
<br>

<br>
This is totally different from what's going on in that report.  I don't think those prisioners are on trial yet.  Our law is, everyone is innocent unless proven otherwise, and they should be treated as one.  I am always not very proud of some of our poltice officers beat up 'suspects', and then let the 'suspects' used the 'officers beat me' excuse to get by the law eventhough they are actually guilty. And if our 'prisioners' use those lame excuses to get past our &quot;jucicial&quot; system, I don't think any of us would be happy. <br>
<br>
If you gonna do something, do it right.  Don't put up a law and try to enforce it if you are not going to follow it.  Don't agree to follow a law/rule and give lame excuses to get by it when it doesnt fit your need.  (These are also the same thinking i have for the &quot;jucicial&quot; system, as well as the 'report'. =P). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwooweewoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wooweewoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/24/02 5:29:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=41>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bleeding Heart Liberal &lt;--- Someone Call a Cleric</span><hr size=1> &quot;There has been absolutely NO evidence of any torture whatsoever.&quot;<br>

There was also no real evidence of who planned 911 attack.  It was all &quot;he said she said&quot; at the begining.  But we did what we could do--suspect (and we didn't only have one suspect too! other later are proven non-related), which finally lead us to track down our enemy.  I am guessing, if those reporters can't give out evidence--they must be suspecting.  Which if it's not true, why shall we mind about it?<br>

That's why we have to make sure we are not breaking the rule ourselves so they can get out easily. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugurunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurunt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 75<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/24/02 7:01:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=161.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bleeding Heart Liberal &lt;--- Someone Call a Cleric</span><hr size=1> <br>
Well, once the attacks happened we had a lot more info that the news could report... security issues, which is a nice grey area.<br>
<br>
I mean, if I rape a girl the cops aren't gonna broadcast 24/7 what evidence they have on me and exactly where they believe I am and when they expect to arrest me.  <br>
<br>
Hindsight, we were dead on who was behind it and where they were.  We didn't make a first move for a month, even tho we had our fingers pointed at and were requesting assistance from the Afgan govt.  <br>
<br>
&quot;with us or against us&quot; isn't 'fight with us or be attacked by us'.   If we have evidence of terrorists in a country, and that country doesn't take sides (ie, leaves the terrorists alone but doesn't &quot;support&quot; them), what are we supposed to do?  Forget about it?  <br>
<br>
War is a crappy solution.  It should always be the LAST solution.  Sometimes it's the only solution.  <br>
<br>
Bring up WWII again.  Can I assume you are against the allied powers aggression against germany... we bombed thier cities and took over their concentration camps and all... why?  were we justified in killing those germans and disrupting thier way of life so?   WWII was horrible, nobody wanted to be involved, we stayed out of it for so long partially because we didn't want to interfere with other soverienty and because we simply don't want to fight wars if there are other options.  But check your history books, Europe *tried* diplomacy for a good while with Nazi Germany, they even all but gave up a country (poland I believe) to them to avoid escalating conflict.  We were ready to sign a nonaggression treaty with Japan before they bombed pearl harbor.<br>
<br>
If someone is determined to kill you, you have two options.  Die, or kill him.  If you run he can chase you.  If you try to talk, sign papers, tell him you love him in spite of your differences, he'll still kill you.   Very few lethal conflicts are a result of 2 sides who both want to fight.   The concept of 'call the police' doesn't apply in international relations, there is no police.  The UN has no power to stop anyone, and with terrorists you don't even have a political body to be at odds with. <br>
<br>
The only &quot;good&quot; thing you could possibly walk away from in this situation we have is we hit the breaking point before those lunatics used a nuke or serious biological weapon.   The chances of it happening now vs a year ago are SIGNIFICANTLY reduced.<br>
<br>
The thing getting me about the prisoners now is it's not a basic checkup on us, it's a media circus... playing as if these assholes are the victims in all of this.  Now, if you wanna talk the hundreds of suspects that have been detained since 9/11 within the US, you got a big grey area... that is a very tough balance of civil rights and defense of life.  These POW's from afganistan are not.  They are the enemy, period.  They have shown a strong tendency and aptitude to revolt and kill while being detained as prisoners.  They are being treated a HELL of a lot better than they had treated their own people.  The US government isn't banning anyone from checking up on thier treatmetn, it's a total non issue.<br>
