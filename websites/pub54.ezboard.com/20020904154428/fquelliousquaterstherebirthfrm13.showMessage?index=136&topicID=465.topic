I haven't heard anyone talk about busting up an existing camp.<br>
<br>
The problem is.. the list... not who is there now, but why is the person 10 spots down more deserving than someone in SF ready to go after the current camp is over?<br>
<br>
If kildare *is* camping Ragefire anyone trying to jump is an ass.  This is completely irregardless of the list.  It's jumping an existing camp.  <br>
<br>
If Kildare gets Rage and then 2 (or 3 or 4 or 40) clerics are there hoping for the next rage... who decides who is next?  This is what the list is trying to solve but it's turning into bullying  and monopolizing at this point.  You *will* get ppl not willing to go on a 40-long and growing list.  You *will* get ppl that ride other folk's work to coast to their rage on the list, while someone else ready and able and willing to put in the work themselves gets insulted and &quot;blacklisted&quot;.  <br>
<br>
It was brought up to shorten the list to 2 or 3 clerics tops then random to fill the 'next' slot every time rage dies.   This is deemed &quot;unfair&quot; only by folks that get to make the long list.  This is not coincidental.  <br>
<br>
It always sucks when somebody monopolizes something, but it's always great to be a monopoly.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I support whatever my teammate-cleric wants in regards to the list and ffa on Rage.  We have 3 clerics on the list currently.  If a cleric wants to hard-camp the mob outside the list I support that also. I won't condone stealing an existing camp, but a cleric there when/before Rage dies has as much right to the next Rage as anyone.<br>
<br>
The list is an option, it's not an authority.  I like the idea behind it, I think it's an admirable effort, but it's getting topheavy and the bigger the list gets, and the less flexible and more antagonistic the list-users get to new clerics... the closer it gets to failing. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

<br>
My sentiments exactly.  Kidare *is* camping ragefire and has an existing camp that will be maintained until he gets his ragefire.  Right after Prizmo gets his, of course.<br>
<br>
That is why I might have seemed a bit *upset* when I made my first post because it would be jumping an existing camp.<br>

Nowhere in this thread have I advocated the dissolution of the list (dissolution has four syllables Lauriston - have Mommy look up that word for you).  However, I do feel that the Cleric epic is perhaps the most poorly designed quest in the game and is in dire need of tweaking or redesign.<br>
<br>
Yes - my wife got her epic.  More power to her.<br>
Yes - I got my Red Scale.  More power to me.<br>
And for the record, No - Tristadorn didn't throw me out of Radiant.  I walked out.  Why?  Because it was turning into a guild of insufferable pricks.  And you seem to fit right in.  So why don't you go &quot;r0x0r Tristadorn's c0x0r&quot; some more.<br>

The only system Verant supports and ondones on Ragefire is first come first serve (FFA). Contrary to whatever other speculation there might be. Gms will act as mediators if more than one raid is present and ready to do the spawn. Thats pretty much the end of it.<br>
<br>
 Palz. I laughed at your threats because I dont see DB getting keyed up in SSRA anytime soon. Whatever that 'clap tov' nonsense meant thats where most of the top guilds are now, so its kind of laughable to threaten them. There are plenty of high level guilds outside vis lc and waif as well. Rel in Por is just one of those for example, there are others. The fact is like Gurunt said - it is the job of the list makers to convince people to support the list not to make demands and threats (paraphrase). Once that happened any marginal moral superiority they might have had claim to went out the window.<br>

That is a non sequitor. I would be in favor of, and offer support to, any civilized and organized method of killing epic mobs of any flavor. There isn't, as yet, enough competition to force this, so it hasn't been done. But it could be, and I think it would be a good idea, in priciple.<br>
<br>
Rage is the slowest spawn and most contensted piece for the most important epic to any guild, whether they actively engage in it's acquisition, or expect new recruits to already have it, they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> depend</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on it regardless.<br>
<br>
If Rage went FFA it is far too easy now, for some guilds to monopolize the spawn with a trivial amount of effort. They would be irresponsible if they did NOT do so, to protect the interest of their clerics.<br>
<br>
It would not be wrong for those guilds to do so. FFA is FFA, if the clerics want FFA then they can live with their choice.<br>
<br>
Now.. Jlail:<br>

I would hope this is not the case. However, going FFA would do nothing to address this issue, and further make it much more likely that non mains would take Rage spawns.<br>

[/quote]that certain guilds seem to be overly represented on the list, [/quote]<br>
<br>
This is a valid point. I have suggested that this be addressed, but the best you guys (the clerics) have come up with is no consecutive clerics from the same guild. Personally I don't think that is enough, and there should be a limit per guild. On thinking of it maybe something like one slot per guild + one slot per 5 epicless 51+ cleric they have guilded. Or something. But it's not my call.<br>

Welcome to 'the vision' ;P Limited spawns per server means this will be polotical. Guilds are political. EQ is politcal. Don't mean to sound harsh but get ofver it and move on, it's the game you are playing.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that no consideration is given for having completed other steps of the epic, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I totally agree with this. But the issue of verification came up, and it is valid. I thought that displaying the Ix staff would be good, but S pointed out (basically) that a cleric would have to know ahead of time not to turn it in for the orb. I think something along these lines is good, but how to verify?<br>

There may be some truth to this. It's human nature to help your friends. But you can't change it from the outside. Join up and lobby for some tweaks.<br>
<br>
Jlail, the thing is, without the list GS will not be getting many epics. At least not for free. High AA toons and luclin gear means it is very easy for some guilds to get these mobs if they want. I doubt VM or LC would care, but there are others that would. And they don't need to send many people. I don't see how a guild like GS, who I have great respect for, will be able to compete in a FFA system.<br>
<br>
I think the cleric list needs to address the concerns you have, but I don't think doing away with it is a good idea.<br>

<br>
Brazzo, I like some of your ideas. there is enough competition that some standards for being enlisted merit being put in place.<br>
<br>
To be honest I think high level clerics should have preference over lower. A 51 is possibly a pl'ed twink. A 60 is not and has proven they play a lot and are less likely to quit after being epified.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If we know he popped (and make no mistake, the big guilds would know if it was in their best interests), what are the odds you are getting your piece from Rage that day, assuming we decide we want to take him?

Bingo. Exactly right. And will happen. And is much easier to happen now. If the list goes away guilds like DB and GS will be sad. Really these people should be on the same side.<br>

<br>
You won't get ganked. There is lots of support for the sitting cleric. Most burners will drop what they are doing to come help. Four or five burners who can be there in seconds grouped with your cleric == no ganking.<br>
<br>
But this very support is why the keepers of the list have to be a little proactive in being responsive to issues with the list. As it stands now it would be almost impossible for anyone but the big guys to gank Rage. But that doesn't mean they should be complacent or cocky.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The system is doomed to fail with this unyielding attitude from those who manage the list. Period. - Desi<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I suspect you may be right in that. I think they need to be in some ways more restrictive and also more responsive to complaints. I don't know Mlain, and I came and helped kill his Rage, but if he's as bad as everyone says I don't think some rules in place to mitigate situations like that would be bad.<br>
<br>
Here's the thing. When the list was short, it didn't seem reasonable to have any prerequisites to getting listed. Despite some people with the foresight (*cough*) suggested there be some criteria.<br>
<br>
Now the list is WAY long and will only get longer. If it gets TOO long it may even be necessary to cut the list short, which I think most listed clerics won't like. There needs to be some fair restrictions. Yes level is fair. Yes quota per guild is fair. Yes being LP is fair.<br>
<br>
Suggestions.<br>
<br>
(1) Level limit for new clerics being added. I'd say mid fifties. 56 sounds good to me. I think 51 is too low.<br>
<br>
(2) Have the persons <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> guildleader</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> vouch that they are LP. That's pretty close to proof.<br>
<br>
(3) Have only X per guild on the list with one more allowed per Y un epiced clerics in that guild of at least the level set in (1).<br>
<br>
These are my ideas. Others have been suggested.<br>
<br>
I also like the idea of occasional FFA spawns.<br>
<br>
It will be painful if the listed clerics are not grandfathered, howerver if something is not done about holding it down soon a more major reorganization may have to take place.. IE everyone after 10 removed and lotto for the next 5. That would be bad IMO.<br>
<br>
Keep this in mind. The rules must be agreed to by the clerics, but the system must be supported by the community. If the rules are not seen to be fair the community will stop supporting it. If the list is seen to be too long gank attempts will occur. It's a tricky tightrope to walk, and I would not want to walk it myself, but the list keepers signed on for the job and it's their responsibility to walk it.<br>
<br>
A civilized system is preferable, but you can't take it for granted either.<br>
