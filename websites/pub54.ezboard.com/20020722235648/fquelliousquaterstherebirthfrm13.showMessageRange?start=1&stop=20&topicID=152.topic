Sunday, December 23, 2001: Pastor decries Harry Potter message CCC minister to kindle holy fire in which to burn books of witchcraft<br>
<br>
December 24, 2001<br>
<br>
By James Matise<br>
Staff Writer<br>
<br>
The Harry Potter fiction series, widely heralded by critics as exceptional literature and by teachers for tuning millions of children into reading, is being condemned by Christ Community Church pastor Jack Brock as evil.<br>
<br>
Harry Potter is nothing but witchcraft, Brock said. Its evil hidden behind the face of an innocent boy with little glasses.<br>
<br>
Brock, who will be giving a sermon this Sunday entitled, The Baby Jesus or Harry Potter? said the church plans to hold a holy bonfire Dec. 30 to publicly burn Harry Potter books and other so-called unacceptable material.<br>
<br>
The service begins at 6:30 p.m. and afterwards we will conduct a burning, he said. <br>
<br>
Why does Brock find Harry Potter so offensive?<br>
<br>
The simple part is the story takes place in Hogwarts Boarding School, he said. All the teachers are witches and wizards, and they teach witchcraft.<br>
<br>
If we hired someone who was into witchcraft or teaching witchcraft at (Christ Community Church) school, no one would come, he said. <br>
<br>
In the book, written by British author J.K. Rowling, Brock said Harry Potter is labeled as being a wizard who wields good magic, and fights those who wield bad magic, something Brock also said is misleading.<br>
<br>
Its (magic) all evil, he said. What she (Rowling) has done is make Harry look good and Voldemort (the villain) evil, but they both come from the same source. You cant call good evil, or evil good. Thats what it is all about.<br>
<br>
Brock said the witchcraft in the book is capturing the minds of young kids, who have a hard time dividing between fantasy and reality, and make them more prone to dabbling in evil practices.<br>
<br>
Though Brock could not recall hearing any actual reports of children engaging in harmful practices as a result of reading Harry Potter, he said the books could inspire them to learn about real witchcraft practices such as Wicca, which he termed an abomination.<br>
<br>
The greatest danger is these children are enamored with Potter and they go on the Internet to learn more about the book, and theyre directed to other places where they can see information about Wicca, he said.<br>
<br>
Brock went on to say that although the Harry Potter books are works of fiction, they are essentially teachings in Wicca.<br>
<br>
The teachers are reading Harry Potter in school and thats a religion, he said.<br>
<br>
Brock said he has not personally read any of the books, nor has he seen Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone in the movie theaters.<br>
<br>
Ive seen video clips and reviews, he said. Readers Digest and other magazines are carrying titles about the author such as The woman who bewitched the world, and The wizard behind Harry Potter.<br>
<br>
When asked why childrens tales featuring magic such as The Wizard of Oz and C.S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia were considered acceptable material, Brock said it was because the wicked witches were beaten and the characters did not learn to use magic.<br>
<br>
When reminded of Dorothys magic red slippers in The Wizard of Oz stolen from the Wicked Witch of the East and the magical gifts given to the heroes of C. S. Lewis The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Brock said yes, but that was good magic.<br>
<br>
Brock said on Dec. 30, other items, such as pornography and Heavy Metal records that exalt Satan will go into the fire with Harry Potter, depending on what items the congregation plans to dispose of.<br>
<br>
Brock said he was not concerned with any public image the book-burning might give himself or the congregation.<br>
<br>
As far as Im concerned, the church is not out to make people look good ... were making a statement against evil, he said. The problem with most churches today is that nothing is said because theyll get people upset. This will get them thinking.<br>
<br>
Jim Preston, director of the Alamogordo Public Library, expressed disagreement with Brocks analysis of Harry Potter, but defended Brocks right to free expression.<br>
<br>
Pastor Brock can choose to burn Harry Potter books at his church since that is his Constitutional right, he said. One can also go to the Public Library and choose or simply not choose to read Harry Potter books.<br>
<br>
Let each person be fully convinced in their own mind regarding what they think is right and let them choose, Preston continued, but let no one take away that right to exercise ones right to choose.<br>

<br>
I'm not going to debate my beliefs on the concept of good and evil magic in the real world, though I do believe it exists.<br>
I will state that I oppose book burning in any fashion.  As I feel everyone has the right to express their opinion in any media they deem fit as long as its done so responsibly.  You don't like the ideas being expressed, don't read the book or watch the program.<br>
<br>
As to Pastor Brock's claims that the &quot;good&quot; characters in C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia series did not use magic, that's a bold faced lie.  Aslan (one of the primary characters in the series) did use magic and was up front about admitting to its use.  To say nothing of the fact that the different characters that appeared through the series often had a magic wielding benefactor helping them along the way.<br>
<br>
I'll be more honest than he was though and tell you why C. S. Lewis' books are acceptable and J. Rowlings' books are not.    Lewis converted to Christianity and a lot of his books, letters, and essays espouse basic Christian morals and concepts.  Even the symbolism between characters and events in the Chronicles of Narnia mirror biblical writings.  Something else often convienently forgotten is that a lot of Lewis' writings were considered questionable by Christian leaders at the time.  <br>
<br>
God forbid this pastor actually take the time to read the Harry Potter books and use them as an opportunity to emphasize to his congregation the importance of parents taking the time to clarify the &quot;shades of grey&quot; with their children.  Instead he's taking the easy way out and acting in total ignorance, which is, a totally unchristian thing to do.   <p>M.

If they do, I only hope that they don't get their information from people like Pastor Brock.<br>
<br>
It's sad that there are still men (and women) like this in the world but Brock has the right to say what he wants about the books and even burn them if he so chooses.  Too bad he didn't even take the time to read them before he formed an opinion about them.  Perhaps I am being too cynical but does anyone else think bonfire is just a publicity stunt?<br>
<br>
I think instead of putting my copies of Harry Potter on the pyre, I will lend them out to friends or donate them to my local library.  Perhaps I will put up another &quot;banned&quot; book while I am there... there are several classics from which choose now. <p>Juror Beaumains<BR>

<br>
There are good and evil forms of witchcraft, as a practicing witch confirmed to the class in the first college I attended with a small cauldron on display. Voodoo is real. So is Santeria, which is a marriage of Catholic saints and West African deities (with that regard mine is Babalu Aye). I don’t understand how reminders that older religions have endured--or adapted to--the centuries can drive people into such hysterics.<br>
<br>
Christians are encouraged to spread the teachings of the Bible to anyone willing to hear. I don’t say they are encouraged to convert anyone, because ultimately, by their own teachings they should be aware that the only one who can save a wo/man’s soul is God. I find it humorously ironic that the pastor chose a book burning at such a time. As a nation we felt a wave of repulsion when everyone realized at once that there was rich sod pushing his religious interpretation on an entire nation half a world away. (BTW, I could go on and on about how the spirit of the Qu’ran’s fourth sura with regards to the treatment of women is worked around to benefit men, sic 4:19. O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will.) Brock can’t make you toss one in, but the way he chooses to express his disapproval is reminiscent of every charismatic ignoramus who walked the earth.<br>
<br>
Freedom is a double-edged sword. I wouldn’t have it any other way. Don’t get too upset. Have a laugh like I did when a fellow Christian told me Bugs Bunny came from the depths of hell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Krup Knight</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/27/01 6:21:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *sighs*</span><hr size=1> ahh memories..

There are people who label Everquest as evil.. <br>

In all these instances they never played nor read or did the thing they were so against to actually see if it was evil in essence..<br>

Personally I believe if there is magic around.... its not all bad as its the actions of its user who determines if its used for evil and good..<br>

As for christians who are always the ones who instigate the idea of some popular culture as evil..<br>

<br>
The Crusades, The Spanish Inquisition, The Slaughter of the Incas, The Holocaust.  Just to name a few that come right to mind.  <br>
<br>
Of course, what the small-minded and deluded people responsible for these horrors don't understand is that they are not infallible, and neither is their man-made system of beliefs.  their definitions of good and evil are narrow, self-serving, and more often than not inaccurate.  their insistance on forcing their beliefs onto others displays some of the basest qualities to be found in the human being.  <br>
<br>
Neitzche said that religion is the opium of the masses.  fine, fine, so the people need something to believe in to make the chaotic and sometimes unfriendly world they live in seem a bit more stable.  so they need a crutch to lean on, an anchor to hold them down when the wind starts blowing.  fine.  but a problem arises when they start getting ideas floating around in their little heads that are altogether too complex for their very limited faculties to have a working understanding of.  suddenly they have all the answers to the deep questions that the wise men and philosophers have been pondering since the beginning of time.  so what do they do with their newfound answers to the meaning of life?  of course!  shove it down the throats of the &quot;pagans&quot; and &quot;intellectuals&quot;.  heck, burn em alive if they don't agree with us!  the bible tells us so.<br>
<br>
/end rant. organized religion isn't a source of evil in and of itself.  it's when you mix religion and stupid people that things go all wrong... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucamdin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Camdin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/28/01 8:30:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Book Burning</span><hr size=1> what a dumbass... seems to me that this guy is doing this cause his collection plate is getting lighter as folks find the right religion for them.

The END IS NEAR!!<br>
<br>
Cut the crap.  If a person really wanted to, you could make anything &quot;evil&quot; and unacceptable.  Example:  Transformers, talking, possesed cars that shapeshift into robots (or vise versa).  Carebears:  they talk!!  They must be possesed by satan.<br>
<br>
People need to use some common sense about these things.  As a person above mentioned, I don't see this guy lining up rows of The Wizard of Oz to roast with the Harry Potter stuff.  What about Star Wars?  Let's burn them too!!  They used mind control and Telekinesis in those movies.  All this guy is going to end up accomplishing is depriving kids of perfectly good works of art.  It is sad and pathetic. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uerzinen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Erzinen</A> at: 12/28/01 10:59:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ukindirdblood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kindir DBlood</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/28/01 11:24:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=152.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/rhornseth/monkey.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Book Burning</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If we hired someone who was into witchcraft or teaching witchcraft at (Christ Community Church) school, no one would come, he said. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

My favorite all time &quot;really we know what we are doing, we swear&quot; incident has got to be back in the 1980's the Vatican issued a press release that said: (I saved this article, I don't have it in front of me but it is verbatim if not very close) In light of RECENT scientific evidence Galelio's excommunication was recinded, and he was then considered a member in good standing in the church. <br>
<br>
Now this is all fine and dandy that the Cathlolic Church was notified 15 years ago or so that the world really does orbit the sun. Up until then  I suppose they still thought we were the center of the universe and as such the sun MUST orbit us. But what boggles the mind is what this statement inplies.<br>
<br>
Scene: Hell, at the doors to the elevator to heaven.   <br>
<br>
Devil:Hey Galelio old buddy, it's been great having you but the Infallible Pope has just changed his mind and you get to go upstairs. <br>
<br>
Galelio: Really? How nice of him. I want to thank you for all your hospitality for the last 400 years.<br>
<br>
Galelio steps onto the elevator, it rises up to heaven and he is met at the top by God. <br>
<br>
God: Oh dude, I am soooo sorry you were stuck down there all this time. My hands were tied you know... the Pope says your a bad boy, what can I do? I have been sending divine messages to the Popes  now for 400 years trying to get them to rethink this decision but they keep dying before I can get through to them. <br>
<br>
Galelio: Hey man, it's np. It's a bit chilly up here, will my room have a heater?<br>

Anything can be thought of as evil if you twist it around enough : Everquest and the Harry Potter books are just an example of someone doing it a little more publicly.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think this person has just made his religion slightly less popular, rather than achieving what he wanted. Still, I guess the sales of the Harry Potter books will shoot up, he sounds like someone who would buy an entire shop's stock just to burn them all.... I'm not a religious person myself but I've always been happy to let others worship what and who they want; however, its things like this that make me glad I'm agnostic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><HTML>

<br>
Why Catholic lore, you ask? It breaks the ice at parties. For instance, did you know that the office of the Inquisition was only abolished in the 50's? No kidding.<br>
<br>
I have, in my time, gone from hot-blooded atheism to slightly warm atheism to the knowledge that what I belive isn't worth another scar. I'm still saddened- and worried- when I find there are people out there who haven't figured that out yet.<br>
