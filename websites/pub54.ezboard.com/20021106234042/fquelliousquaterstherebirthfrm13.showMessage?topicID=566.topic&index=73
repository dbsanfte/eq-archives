Some old content as-is will be impossible.<br>
<br>
Most old content will be zergable if the only change is to cut the HP down... <br>
<br>
Some won't be.. ring of vulak... probably work fine as-is.. it's long, it's hard, but it's not mod rod dependant.  Might be a bit harder without mods, but it's not a one-mob encounter that requires a cheal rotation for an extended period.<br>
<br>
Emperor as-is cannot be killed without mod rods.  Not by any reasonable force... he simply cannot die fast enough.  Cut his HP to where LC or Wraith could drop him before the heal team goes OOM and he becomes zergable...<br>
<br>
NEW content designed from the ground up is different..  and VI could have the changes all ready to go...but their track record for making changes and thinking/testing them before dropping them on us is very bad.  <br>
<br>
Really the only reason I'm upset about this isn't a &quot;game balance&quot; issue and is totally self-centered.   My team has got Emp down finally, after months of farming keys/banes and a few  obligatory die-and-learn raids ... and they gonna change it.  That just sucks... (much like a soloing monk or MB-team wizard... balanced or not, it's like a kick to the ribs in the short term) <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

coming out  about  CH  rotations and  Mod Rod  cycling..<br>
<br>
  Vi designed these mobs to be  HARD...  We as players have<br>
tried basically  everything  we can to kill the mobs in a fast,safe manner....<br>
<br>
  Complete heal rotation is  and  prolly always will be the most viable means of killing  most &quot;Boss&quot; type mobs because of the high damage output they have...  Sadly  rushing the mob like we  do against  Vox or  Naggy isn't a valid option..  These  mobs simply have too many hps and hit to hard for any one cleric to keep alive  whichever group member draws aggro..<br>
<br>
As to why  Mod rods became so popular?   It allowed  fewer people to  actually fight a &quot;Boss&quot; mob and have a  decent chance at winning...  or in the case of  Mobs Like  EMP, who's HPS and  Damage output is  such that the fight is taking 40-45 minutes, current mana regen just doesn't get the job done for a fight of this duration.....<br>
<br>
 I still honestly  believe most of you are missing the point , as to what  VI's true motives are....  I am of the opinion  VI  wants to  force us to   use more people to kill  the harder mobs in the game and in essense take skillz out of the equation,  where  20 ppl could take down Mob_01  due to mod rods being effective mana regen.  Now the same Mob might require  25-30 ppl...   <br>
  To everyone whom actually believes the tougher encounters are gonna be appropriately  re-tuned...   HAHAHAHAHA,  boy do i have some land to sell to you....  VI has always used the <br>
&quot;quote&quot;  Uber guilds to determine a zones  toughness or whether UberMob_00001  needs to be adjusted.......<br>
    I for one did spend all this time leveling to  60 and working my arse of to upgrade my gear, just to find i still need  30-80 ppl  to go kill the majority of the tougher mobs and nope i don't mean to trivilize these encounters, but for our relative power to mob power has grown weaker the higher in level we get as opposed to getting stronger.. But once  POP  comes out and  enough players  reach lvl 65...... i foresee   Kunark and  Velious  &quot;Boss&quot; mobs being upgraded because now they will be   Trivial to all the lvl 65 ppl.......  Much like the planes  where upgraded to deal with the new cap of lvl 60.... Now try going to planes with a raid force of mostly  lvls 46-50 and see whats happens...... The point is as we gain lvls and upgrade our gear, some encounters  should become  trivial,  hence VI releases  expansions to provide new challenges.... NOT retool old zones and force the lower lvls  to bury thier nose to the exp grind so that they can  gain the extra lvls  to be able to handle the new upgraded mobs...<br>
<br>
All in all it's the same song and dance from  VI......  <br>
<br>
We dont want you soloing!!!<br>
We dont want you to kill our  UBER Boss mob with under 30 ppl..<br>
We want to make you play longer and have less real chance at upgrades.....<br>
<br>
I challenge any of you to  prove me wrong on this......<br>

<br>
Zerging in the traditional sense was pretty much described above, Where a cleric with a clickstick, and 50 people with to much experience to waste throw themselves at said uber-mob until either he dies, or you die (repeatedly). This &quot;tactic&quot; hasn't really been used lately by anyone I can remember, but back when people were still learning things, it worked - sorta.<br>
<br>
When people refer to Wraith or who ever as Zerg'ers its not really referring to the above defenition, but rather one of excess power in some people's eyes. Some mid-high end encounters don't take 50 people to kill, but using 50 people makes it easier/quicker. Some smaller guild take pride in killing say Aaaryonar or Statue with 20-30 people.  It makes things harder, increases the chances of something going wrong, but also makes for one helluva challenge in the end. <br>
<br>
Some encounters simply cannot be killed by the smaller guilds, no matter what tactics they employ if they cannot get a &quot;proper&quot; turnout of 50+ people. I recognize this.  When people call some guild Zerg'ers it's because 50+ people kill something which can be killed with 20-30 people. I'm not saying its a bad thing or that you couldn't do the same with the same numbers, it's just that you don't, because you do have the 50+ turnout.<br>
<br>
The smaller guys, take pride in killing more with less, I'm one of the smaller guys.<br>
<br>
Aaryonar and his two pets on the same pull Killed with 32 people - that was the proverbial shit. It was the challenge and the success that made it so.<br>
