I tried to be as brief as possible but I also tried to make sure I covered everything.<br>
<br>
1. I have no problem with McPally or Asylum of Vengance as a group. During the course of the night, McPally was amicable, helpful and easy to work with. An unkind word never escaped his lips and after our wipeout, he did in fact offer to rez several of our people.<br>
<br>
2. In my opinion, the first issue that night was that an AoV's monk was feigned in the middle of our camp. While I feel that McPally was cooperative, communicative and an all around nice guy, I do question the degree of awareness or control he had over that particular puller at that point in the night. <br>
<br>
3. The second issue is that a select few individuals from AoV began hurtling insults at my crew when we reentered HoT. I myself took note of these comments and can confirm that they did indeed last for quite some time. Those who were doing the bad mouthing were under the assumption that we were barging through their camp and taking their spawns. Unbeknownst to them was that I had spoken to McPally before we succored, when we succored, when we arrived at the HoT door and when we entered. I asked permission to pull the pit when I learned his monk was dead, I told him we would be out of his way quickly and I informed him the moment we departed from HoT entrance. But ignorant of this they became unruly and hostile towards our group. <br>
<br>
4. Most of  my folks got pretty upset and, although I empathized, I was dismayed to see a few of them return the hurtled insults. When I saw this happen, I quickly put a lid on it in tells and raidspeak. I then extended my deepest apologies to McPally and proceeded to get out of their way as quickly as possible. I as a raid leader believe in good sportsmanship and level-headedness despite the circumstances.<br>
<br>
5. Combining the two issues yields an explosive situation. Extreme hostility followed shortly thereafter by a foreign monk in our camp followed directly thereafter by multiple adds.  One could hardly blame them for thinking that it was intentional train and subsequently getting so angry. I am not saying it was intentional however I am saying that it is quite understandable to see how many of my folks thought that it was. <br>
<br>
6. Concerning the second wipeout at the pillar,  I am reasonably sure that none of my group caused that incident. When it happened, I got headcounts from group leaders and status reports from those that were there. Independently, each confirmed that the others were present, accounted for and sitting on their hands. My gut feeling is that this was some other person who mistakenly opened the door and unwittingly unleashed its inhabitants.<br>
<br>
7. Regarding Inverted Horizons. I had contacted a representative from your guild early on in the night and he had advised me that your group had travelled North and as a courtesy to your fine group, I turned my crew Southward and stayed along that bearing for the next two hours. When we finally succored to the zone, I was told that your raid was no longer there. My apologies and in the future Ill be sure to double check.<br>
<br>
8. Our standard policy is to extend other raids courtesy, treat them with respect and communicate with their leadership as much as possible. We do this not just because we feel it is the right thing to do but also because it is the best thing to do. In the end, produces the fewest number of problems and provides the greatest amount of efficiency and enjoyment on both raids. Furthermore, it is not such a difficult thing to do after all. After raiding HoT for many months we have time and again successfully negotiated with and around other guilds in the zone. In this instance however, I am afraid that a sequence of unlikely circumstances in a chaotic zone precipitated into a minor disaster. <br>
<br>
And when all is said and done it is simply that in the grand scope of things -- minor. In my mind, the issue is moot and dead. I look forward to my raid next week and I invite you and yours to camp HoT on any day you wish. Should we meet again, we will redouble our efforts to make things go more smoothly.<br>

<br>
&quot;FYI on my way back I rez'd 3 peeps and they were all from Lethal Vigilance who I do believe were with you. Now its possible they didnt check the door and just went in and trained that I dont know. I do know we did not train anyone.&quot;<br>
<br>
I am a member of LV and was accually pulling for the ORQ raid. I will tell you that no one from my guild opened the door. They were all screaming about someone training the entrance to ToV and the halls leading up to HoT. We had about 8 people ToV that night and didn't even stay since I had informed them that the entrance and North were camped. All our members have been doing HoT for months and know to ask if the HoT door is clear. I think it is somewhat silly to presume another guild opened the door on the same night someone else from AoV was training mobs everywere. <br>

the decision is made usually really fast. Personally, i'm a fan of killing everything that moves, so if some chode opens the hot door, kill whatever fuckers fly in. They're just drakes, if they aren't green , then they are weak and too easy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://216.40.249.192/mysmilies/contrib/guus/tong.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://xtctripp101.homestead.com/files/Sigs/Acturian_Sig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Problem with that sig is I blasted it off my puter a long time ago and I need to update it bad.  Think Ags was the one hosting it, but I couldn't ever get it to come back up without a broken link... <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.houston.rr.com/danday/gaeaan/sig1.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
HoT you need to be concise and clear as to what area you are pulling.  If someone moves north then those at the door moust either pull south.  The pathing (as the monk in question should well know) is horrendous.  <br>
<br>
Oh and on the monkey summoned stuff, in reality I do not think that this happened.  Before summoning happens you have to deliver a reasonable amount of damage to a mob.<br>

Not sure if this is entirely true in HoT.  One of our monks got summoned tonight when all she was doin was running to a corpse to drag.  Also noticed the door opening a lot lately on it's own.  Don't know if it's a graphics bug or not, but anytime it's opened lately on us while we were fighting, nothing outside agroed.  And this happens when we're the only ones in the zone and we're all inside HoT fighting, so I know it's not some random HoT n00b opening the door without asking.  Place just seems buggy as hell lately. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.houston.rr.com/danday/gaeaan/sig1.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
