I really guess my thoughts of what a guild is, is not realistic with what guilds are. I join guilds to make friends, raid together, and group together.  I guess I'm just dissapointed I almost never find guildies with room for me or scrimps in a group somewhere.  <br>
<br>
Level 50+ and having to LFG for a few hours to get a group is rediculous.  Tons of people talk in guild about not doing pickup groups.. well I can't find a guildy group so I don't think I have that choice.  For that matter I guess I don't know many of my guildies very well yet if at all.  I was just hoping having a 50+ guild with a decent number of balanced classes meant I could log on and go play somewhere with guild not LFG for a few hours then give up and play an alt like I did in my old tiny guild. <br>
<br>
 I don't know what all I have to say about this but I guess I'd like some initial feedback from officers and leader first and foremost but also from the rest of our members. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwhallil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whallil</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guild Officer</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#CC9933>(10/25/01 9:42:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Guild grouping?</span><hr size=1> I think most of the problem is that it's a matter of timing. if your on at the right time then a group is put together. more often than not though its tough because of the guild being short of enchanters. i also haven't been doing much exp hunting lately. i think that will change soon though. i'll make sure to look for ya when i do decide to put a group together.<br>
<br>
thats another point. alot of members need to take the initiative of puting together a group. more often than not members log on and automaticaly turn on LFG next time you log on try starting a group in a new place (maybe tracknon or HS) and see what kind of response from the guild ya get <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i bet it will be positive.<br>
<br>
best of luck. and don't let the man get ya down<br>

My personal solution has been to go to a zone where are guild member are hunting in a group and tag along with them. Help the group out while they camp then when a spot comes up well your a shoe in. All be it as a necromaner i can fill many shoes with my abilities it more about being togeter than getting exp. Youll find me doing this alot just to spend time with people in OoT we are growing on a daily basis. And it is important that we all get to know each others fighting style so when we get to a raiding situation you know what you can expect. Also you can propse making a few groups in certain areas and have the extra group fight adds 1 balanced group and another offset group could be a mini raid of an area. Be creative 6 man groups were made by Verant but we do not have to stick to that alone thats what makes this game interesting is all the options.<br>

I know some very good exp spots in chardok that I group in regularly and actually almost every night. I know plenty of many classes except cleric and enchie.... =(<br>
<br>
My enchie is level 20 very close to 21 and it will eventually be my main as I will be leading groups to places like chardok and HS and stuff like that. My friend is grouping with me on this server now and has abandoned his level 54+ druid to come be a cleric here with my enchie.  We intend to race up to 50 and start building regular exp groups in odd places. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucolwynn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Colwynn</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#CC9933>(10/26/01 10:53:08 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Guild grouping?</span><hr size=1> I agree that we should try and group together wherever possible.  Obviously this isn't always going to be possible. I know in the case of warriors like myself...transportation is sometimes an issue.  But in any situation where the guild needs me or is trying to put a group together, I'm there.  If anyone's interested, I'm currently camped in Velketor's Labyrinth trying to get to know the zone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'd love some company from OoT members!  Although this weekend is not good for me.  But starting next week, lets throw some Velks xp groups together and stomp the zone...we have the firepower and I do know a couple of 50+ enchie's and clerics if we are short.  Or if someone has a better idea or zone they want to hunt in..let me know or post it here as I did.  We can get a better idea of numbers on any given night if people post their availability in advance.  Maybe this is dumb..but perhaps a weekly &quot;preview&quot; of where you plan to hang out might work?  Then we can coordinate our efforts..anyway just some dumb tank ramblings....hehe.<br>

If you want.  hehe.  I usually hang out with my friend who plays a Shammy.  Me and her are alsways looking for a group that has a two slot open, which is sometimes difficult.  I'm available most evenings about 7 -730 EST until about 1am EST (once in a while 'till 2am).  And I'm off on Sundays and Tuesdays so that evening before I can stay up later most times.  =)<br>
<br>
Let me know if those play times will work for you Atra, I am looking to try and find a some what regular group.  I  hate logging on and asking if anyone needs a 52 cleric and there's  dead silence.  LOL.  Oh and my Shammy friend is on almost all Monday and Wednesday evenings about 8:30 pm till about 1 am. On Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays she's on till about 11 or 12 .   Sorry for all the info, but I hope this helps you and I hope I would be able to group up with you guys some evenings.  <p><BR>
