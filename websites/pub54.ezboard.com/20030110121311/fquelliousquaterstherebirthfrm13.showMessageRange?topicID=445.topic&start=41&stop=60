Read or watch the news to know WTF I'm taking about with the van.  A couple for elderly men (one 50 something and the other 60 something) lost control of their van and hit some people on the sidewalk in Chicago, injuring the pedestrians.  Bystanders pulled them out of the van and beat them to death with a brick.<br>
<br>
My point is there is a difference between an accident and an intentional act of violence.<br>

<br>
And plowing into a crowd of people is still violent weather it is an accident or not.<br>
<br>
Don't deny transgressions of the U.S. military in the past, present or the future we write the rules so it seems like we don't violate them. But we respond with the same fevor and aggression that everyone else does, it doesn't make us right. It makes us hypocritical.<br>

<br>
Do you think there is no difference between premeditated murder, and an accidental death?  Let me help you, one is evil and needs to be punished, while the other is unfortunate, shit happens.<br>
<br>
I don't deny what happened in the past, but it doesn't mean we had it coming.  Those people in the World Trade Center did nothing to those hijackers, they didn't deserve to die.  That's like saying the rape victim dressed like a whore, so she had it coming.<br>

<br>
Pheonix I will not defend, however their objective was military and they were fighting an enemy that frequently cloaked themselves in the guise of civilians. This was, after all one of the main objectives of pheonix, trying to identify the enemy, and to neutralize them. So while they hit 'civilian targets' it was not for the purpose of just killing civilians. It was because they determined that they were not actually civilians. Granted they made this determination on their own, and with no oversight, and made mistakes.<br>
<br>
There <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a difference between someone killing someone else because you think they are secretly an enemy and killing civilians for the mere purpose of enstilling terror.<br>
<br>
I only point that out because you lump Viet Nam in with Bosnia and Iraq. Which I think is not appropriate, because there is a tremendous qualitative difference between them. In Viet Nam we did deliberately hit 'civilian' targets. In Bosnia or Iraq we did not. If you think so it is you who needs to reconnect to reality. The US does not need to engage in terrorism, and there is no benefit to doing so. Certainly civilian targets get hit, but that's why it's so hard to make the decision to enter into these activities. If you do so you are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> going</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to have some very difficult apologies to make before it is done.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yes accidents happen, but only when you lose your head. - Koradina<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think it is also worth noting that Bosnia and Somalia both were Clinton activities. So I guess Clinton lost his head.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It will only create more response along the same lines as Sept. 11th, and it already has. - Koradina<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Our complacency and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> lack</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of response is what encouraged them to try that. Intelligence experts have been warning for a while that something like this would occur, but they were ignored.<br>
<br>
They aren't being ignored now.<br>

Tiger Woods is actualy a puppet ruler. Ben Hogan, a renowned Mason/Illuminati, elaborately faked his death in 1997 so he could rule the golfing world from behind the scenes.<br>

Upon the reflection of the day I think that may have been to strong a word. Although I did not mean every person in Europe is a coward, it's just that I listen to the things being said some times and have to wonder how you would feel if the circumstances were aimed at your nation.  Ask yourself again what you would think is the &quot; right &quot; way to handle someone flying a plane into Big Ben or the Effiel Tower. <br>
<br>
 Yes the UK has had their war with the IRA, and that has been a bloodbath, yet they think they are right and who is any other country to tell them how to handle it? The Jews have to deal with cowards that walk into a diner and blow themselves and others up. Yet people still want a &quot; peaceful &quot; way to resolve it. <br>
<br>
 The thing that angers me the most, is other nations that believe they should be able to tell us the best way to handle issues aimed at us. Quite often Iraq uses aggression aimed at the US and the UK, while our planes patrol the no-fly zones over Iraq. We do this to protect people that that lunatic would gas, or kill, or god knows what else. <br>
<br>
 Agression in history has never been contained by diplomats.  Sometimes you have to force people to go away. Disagree if you want, but at the very least, I would ask our European &quot; allies &quot; to show a little support. <br>

Bush is using the fear and &quot;patriotism&quot; of the post-9/11 US to give himself more power than any president previously has had. Take, for instance, the Fath... err, Homeland Security Act. It creates a new cabinet position and gives Bush <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> direct control</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of a paramilitary organization. That's scary, in and of itself, but what frightens me even more is a Republican-sponsored bill that either was recently voted down or is still in Congress that is seeking to strike down a 200 year old law that makes it illegal for members of the armed services to arrest civilians.<br>
<br>
It looks to my perhaps naif eyes that Bush is looking to create his very own national police force. The only thing that can stop him is Congress, and they don't seem terribly willing to do that thus far.<br>
<br>
An aggressive and manipulative leader... a nation whose economy is hurting... a people that are willing to give up nearly everything to get their foe... and a handy scapegoat to unite the people behind in a near-religous zeal...<br>

<br>
&quot;The point your missing is the hipocrasy that Bush exudes.&quot; <br>
<br>
There is hypocrisy everywhere. A fair amount of it in this very thread.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fact: Bush is on a mission against terrorism, and those that harbor terrorists.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fact: this whole frikken country is on a mission against terrorism. If Bush hadn't acted as such, mobs would've swarmed DC calling for his head on a pike. What, precisely, is wrong about being on a mission against terrorism? This is bad?!?<br>
<br>
&quot;Fact: The U.S. has hit civilian installations in its many attempts to &quot;right the wrongs&quot; made against others and our selves. Examples include but are not limited to; countless villages in Vietnam, the Chinese Embassy, &quot;an old folks home&quot; in Afganistan, countless civilian buildings in Iraq and Afganistan, and who knows what else!&quot;<br>
<br>
First off, read the news, do some research. The Fundamentalist wackos we're dealing with know extremely well the power of media. They will make damned sure that any military target is just slam packed full of civilians, so that when we bomb it, they can scream about how evil we are.<br>
<br>
There is an amazingly interesting lady that lives in my area that grew up in Lebanon during the Muslim takeover of that country. She tells some truly horrid stories both of how the Muslim indoctrinate their children and how they then use/abuse those children as victims waiting to happen. This is all done because they know that their enemy, Jews and Westerners for the most part, are compassionate. We don't like to hear about children dying. This is why they pack children into their military targets. If you don't believe, please look into the forced movement of refugees during the Gulf War into such tasty target zones as chemical warfare facotires and the like.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fact: Most of these transgressions occured in conflicts not wars.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is imply because we've not been to war in a looooong time. Additionally, these &quot;trangressions&quot; as you label them, are far more common in open warfare. Should I be so crass as to ask our Euro friends how many civilian targets were purposefully bombed by both sides in WWII?<br>
<br>
&quot;Fact: The laws that others violate, but the U.S. is immune to are written by the U.S. under the pen name of the U.N. and other &quot;multilateral international organizations&quot;.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is Moral Relativism at its' finest. So, the US legal system isn't good enough to write International Law, and neither is the UN, right? Who is, then? And what International Laws have we broken? Don't wave this stick unless you plan to back it up.<br>
<br>
&quot;My point is that Bush is trying to elminate terrorism with even more terrorism. The only difference is that he is terrorising non-americans. That is hipocracy(sp?) at its finest friend. He is, at best, a blubbering fool when it comes to foreign relations, demonstrated by the fallout of relations and fallout of peace in the mideast since his arival at the white house.&quot;<br>
<br>
Oh please, terrorism is pretty much the unsanctioned and intentional targetting of civilian targets for the purpose of destabilising the citizenry of nation through widespread fear. Hamas are terrorists. Al Qaeda are terrorists. The US Navy is a military force of the US Govt, sanctioned by a recognized world power, doing what it does with full consent of the world community at large. Even frikken China has backed what we did in Afghanistan. <br>
<br>
The Middle East was down-spiralling before Bush ever made office. Clinton tried so desperately to forge a peace agreement, and your vaunted example of diplomacy failed utterly. You know why? Because Arafat realized that, without the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis, he had no power/position. The last real peace agreement, which Arafat walked away from, gave the Palestinians _Everything_ they said they wanted. It failed. It will always fail. Peace in the Middle East is impossible so long as both sides exist in the manner in which they do today. Either Israel needs to go, or they need to kick the shit out of the collective Arab world AGAIN until the Arab nations realize AGAIN that Israel ain't going anywhere. Violence is all they seem to understand.<br>
<br>
&quot;Saying that violence breeds violence is a studitiy in this case, is just wrong, not to mention you don't really give a reason to not act like a hot head. Thats why the nations leaders are there to stop the &quot;fanatcism&quot; that comes with peoples interests being at risk. That is why they are called negotiations, and peace talks. I agree terrorists shouldn't be negotiated with, but Bush doesn't negotiate with anything/anyone that is what makes him a poor president.&quot;<br>
<br>
How, again, is Bush a &quot;Fanatic&quot;? Does he pursue the war on Terrorism to the exclusion of all else? No, I seem to remember a few weeeks ago when he made this inane speech about healthy exercise, etc. I recall other speeches about the economy, education, and a whole myriad of other topics. I've seen pics of him signing bills on all sorts of topics. This is not fanaticism where I come from.<br>
<br>
As far as justification of why he's acting like a hot head, exactly how many American citizens do these fundamentalist wackos have to kill befor eyou think he's justified for wanting to do something? You are sounding more and more like an apologist. <br>
<br>
&quot;And its Tom Daschel, the next president of the U.S. unless a Kennedy is reincarnated.&quot;<br>
<br>
Daschel is a dink. Hillary Clinton will see the presidency before he does. Hell, Gore has a better chance. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

&quot;That is just...ugh, irresponsible. It tells me: &quot;Who cares about the consequences? Let's make the most of the present.&quot; Having too small/large of a deficit is bad, not caring how it gets there is worse.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, it is more a matter of having a set of priorities and sticking to them. Reagan understood that robbing Peter to pay Paul might be bad, but he knew that it was the lesser of two evils compared to what else he was doing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Something I've noticed. Reagan-bashers bash for policies during his term. Reagan-lovers try to tie in the good that occured 8 years after he left the White House with his doing. I wonder how so much can be attributed to an administration that displayed, in my young eyes, an insouciant attitude towards the economy. /whistle &quot;<br>
<br>
It has been my take on this that each president tends to concentrate and focus on one major aspect of the office during their term. Reagan sought to rebuild the military and the economy after Carter left it in a shambles. He may have left us with a deficit, but are you old enough to recall what the country was like under Carter?<br>
<br>
What Reagan did was fire the nation up. He turned an ailing country that had lost _much_ respect post-Viet Nam back into a superpower to be reckoned with. Many non-Americans might not have liked that, but damn me for being happier to be the big kid on the block that everyone hates instead of the sickly kid on the block that everyone still hates. They're going to hate us no matter what we do, so I'd rather at least look scary to attempt to dissuade em a bit. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

You've obviouslt not read about a man known as FDR. You want to talk about power? Shit, read up on him. We're still recovering from thing FDR did.<br>

<br>
Yup, dead scary that Bush might have control over a paramilitary organisation when he's Commander in Chief of the regular army. Yup, them jack-booted HSA agents are soooo scary compared to a company of M-frikken-1's rolling down your street. Ph34r the HSA!<br>
<br>
&quot;That's scary, in and of itself, but what frightens me even more is a Republican-sponsored bill that either was recently voted down or is still in Congress that is seeking to strike down a 200 year old law that makes it illegal for members of the armed services to arrest civilians.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not sure where this is going or where it is coming from. If you believe it is illegal for members of the military to arrest your civilian butt, wander onto a military and punch an MP. He'll arrest you faster than you can yell &quot;Don;t hurt me, I'm a liberal!&quot;<br>

Congress is fairly weak, but I doubt they'll allow a National Police Force, beyond that which we already have.<br>

<br>
I don't totally disagree with you. It scares me deeply that the average joe seems ready to sacrifice his personal freedoms for imaginary security, but I think that comparing Bush to Hitler is so off-base as to make even your normal leftist rants look moderate.<br>
<br>
Still, you are right in that we should pray to God to give us the strength to save us from ourselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me, exactly, how comparing Bush to Hitler was out of line.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hitler, hmmmm, how difficult is this?<br>
<br>
1) Persecuted a war off aggression and land grab against most of Europe. Occupied Belgium, France, Poland, damn me but this list would get long if I continued. <br>
<br>
2) Murdered innocent millions of a particular racial stock out of some odd sacepgoat/eugenics urge.<br>
<br>
3) Utterly destroyed his own nation out of megalomania.<br>
<br>
I don't think that Bush has gotten anywhere near these, and they were just quickie points to tick off. If you'd like to compare Bush to a random fascist, try Mussolini, it might hold up a little bit better historically. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>
