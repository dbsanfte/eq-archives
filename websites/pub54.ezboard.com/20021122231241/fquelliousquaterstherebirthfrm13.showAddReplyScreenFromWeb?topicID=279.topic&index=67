So what are you saying here?? Two wrongs make a right?  That it is ok to KS Maeve and her raid for her epic because one of your friends got screwed over 8 times?  This is one of the most hypocritical things I have seen in quite some time.<br>

Based on your own comments and your log as posted, you were not in visual contact with the mob, nor with Verbo when he engaged. Isn't it likely that Verbo didn't know you had hit the mob, because you weren't within Verbo's, nor the Mob's, sight when Verbo engaged? I'm not giving excuses and I'm not making judgement. I'm only saying that from the evidence presented, it does not appear to me that Verbo &quot;stole&quot; aggro from you. How could he have known you had hit the mob when you weren't within his (and the mob's) sight when he engaged it? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Does this make Verbo correct?  Is just because he didn't see Bippity have aggro make stealing the mob acceptable?  <br>

What I AM saying is that Grim got screwed out of Rage 8 times, and all of them were &quot;legal&quot;, so maybe we should have empathy for him also.  Notice I didn't mention that Radiant was involved in two of those incidences?  Why?  because it's irrelevent to what my post DID mean.  It means that the PnP rules suck and when you've been screwed over numerous times due to abiding by the PnP rules and other Verant rulings (such as being forced to roll on Rage camp when Grim was clearly there first, as addmited by the other party) you tend to get to a point where you say &quot;Fine, if I have to live with the PnP then I am going to play by the PnP&quot;.  That was the jest of my entire post.  Don't twist it to mean something else, it's not a friendly thing to do, and you are wrong to do that.<br>
<br>
Second, regarding my comments on Bip's and Verbo's pull...<br>
<br>
You asked if that &quot;makes Verbo correct?&quot;   It doesn't make Verbo correct IF he knew he was KSing and did it on purpose anyway. But, by virtue of Bip's own comments Verbo didn't know Bip had engaged.  HOW could he have KNOWN Bip was engaging it, if he couldn't SEE Bip, because Bip wasn't nearby where he could see him?  If you come upon a mob and no one is around, and you engage, how can you possibly be KSing it? <br>
<br>
I'm wasn't there so I can't comment on what was known and unknown from my personal perspective.  I can only comment based on the testimonies posted here and none of them show any proof that Verant's rules were viloated.  If anything, the testimonies suggest that the rules were NOT violated.  <br>
<br>
But hey, maybe I am wrong in my interpetation.  If so, feel free to post the entire PnP and set me straight.  In the meantime please refrain from changing the meaning of my posts to something that fits your feelings.  I am discussing the situation based on Verant's published guidelines and the presumed honest testomony, not my opinion and not your feelings.   <br>
<br>
Let's be civil and not attack the people, just attack the rules that make this sort of thing happen.  Rules that suck.  Rules that Verant should have fixed a long, long time ago.  Rules that force people to live by the same sword they have died by. <br>

<br>
Raidiant was already there, already suffered loss of time due to CR for a quick and fast break-in, and had roamers pulled, and made it apparent to others on their intent of why they're in the zone.<br>
<br>
To gather other people to intentionally take advantage of the time other people have spent is plain and simply WRONG.  Regardless of VI's rulin in favor or not, we are people behind these characters.  Don't run over people in life.<br>
<br>
I have to admit, I'm really getting tired of hearing all these bad stories of ADD as of lately.  It seems I hear a new story about them KSing or some such at least once a week.  I've been witness to at least 3 of the occurrances.<br>
<br>
Are the folks in ADD doing this on purpose?  Is it part of their guild charter?  Most of us are grown, and we still have to put up with a neighborhood bully?  Why not do something nice for someone for a change??<br>
<br>
It's a shame to play a game to 'get away' from real life's trials and tribulations, to just have grief players try and ruin even that small time of leisure.  Kinda makes me want to take golf back up instead of playing EQ with people that enjoy ruining good times and fellowship.<br>
<br>
Knowing that what you have done is wrong is one thing.  Trying to find excuses and loopholes to make you feel good about yourself and trying to make others think that you are innocent when you do something wrong is kinda like going to AA and saying that you don't have a drinking problem.  The first step to recovery is admittance.<br>

Verbo knew damn well he was ksing.  He knew our entire guild was pulling toward the wraith, he knew we were prepared to kill it, and he knew that we had just gotten rid of all the mobs that were between the wraith and ourselves.  When you aggro someone's mob in an xp camp, do you say &quot;sorry I've got more aggro so you're @#%$ outta luck?&quot;  or do you respect the fact that they had all rights to that mob and let them have it like a decent person.  I know which one my friends and I do, but then, we seem to differ from ADD in a lot of ways.<br>

WEre not going down the road of &quot;What if Verbo didnt know Bipp agrod it first&quot; unless ADD wants to stop mocking Bipps post (assuming officers speak for ADD?) addressing it directly saying: It seems that Bipp agrod the mob first, but verbo didnt know that.   If ADD wants to admit that then we can talk bout it.  But they arnt saying that.  its not clear what they think of Bipps post.  <br>
<br>
So until then its clear to everyone else ADD stole the mob Bipp agrod first.  <br>

I do not understand your posting here at all. <br>
I was the one who pulled the shissir and like 10 amys and two cubes and a TT at once. The shissir was agro free and i engaged and pulled. I spent 40 mins sending tells to twistadowhoever. I tried to resolve the situation as best I could and even talked to bip. Banelion then took up the task after twistadowhoever told me to fgk off. I was also told by Bip that well thats twistadowhoever for you. We were forced to roll for the Rage camp so we used that rule that was used on us. <br>
The pull was clean and I got shissir to camp solo and fained ....when twistadowhoever (forgive me I did not want to check the screen shot) trained the temple mobs on us. <br>
We got the kill and looted as needed. I will say that rules that are used for a case sometimes can be used against you in others. After the swc was clear of amys I ressed the cleric and began cr again and was trained by Tristadorn. We were able to camp as I trained the mobs back. Liuim from VM was there helping us and was killed by Trists train. I do not understand how peeps think training a monk can do anything. I guess thats their own idea.<br>
 <br>
We will follow the rules that have been placed on us. Its just that simple if rolling is what you want ,rolling is what you get.<br>
 <br>
I hope that gets pasted in like 10 posts I dont care. There I even spaced it out for you. <br>
<br>
Know my words and know them to be true and with the power of which I speak. We will be fair and play by the lame rules that are in place.<br>
But dont call me friend and post behind my back !!!!<br>

did you agro Shissar first?<br>
do you believe the log posted by Bippity is true?<br>
<br>
<br>
I mean thats not for us. thats not for radiant.  The whole quellious community wants to know?  Thats why your here isnt it? Its not in your post.<br>
<br>
Radiant was in the zone first you guys have admited that.<br>
Radiant cleared the temple first you guys have admited that.<br>
Now what you keep glancing over as officers is whether or not your disputing that bippity agrod first.  <br>
<br>
You clearly have an interest in clearing this up.  i know were not talking to each other.  And that would do the most to clear it up.  QC will thank you for answering those questions verbo, officer of ADD.<br>

<br>
Let another Guild clear to a mob, then follow them and make them roll for a spawn? I don't think so!<br>
<br>
Zones like Fear inwhich a guild MUST CLEAR to get to a mob, then it's theirs until they FAIL at the mob. <br>
<br>
If a guild wants the AoW, they get it by killing Vindi, Statue, Idol. If you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  EXPECT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a guild to then ROLL on who gets the AoW, your out of your mind. Theres a difference between the Ragefire camp and the Plane of Fear. The ragefire camp is camped usually by a lone cleric without the necessary force to kill ragefire. In those instances when ragefire does pop, the group who gets there with sufficient force gets the mob. If two or more guilds get there with sufficient force at about the same time, then a GM can force a roll.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  HOWEVER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the Wraith in PoF is different. Radiant apparently had &quot;SUFFICIENT FORCE&quot; present before ADD zoned in, cleared to the mob. Whether or not they aggroed the Wraith at this point is pointless. They were there first, they did the clearing, and by <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  ALL RIGHTS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have first shot at the Wraith. What ADD did in my eyes is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  WRONG</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>

<br>
&quot;Guild Rules And Conduct<br>
The following rules have been established to make our playing time more enjoyable and not as a means to take away from an individual&amp;#146;s total gaming experience. <br>
<br>
1) Conduct and Character Issues: <br>
<br>
With regard to conduct and attitudes, we encourage people to have fun, laugh and enjoy each other&amp;#146;s company. Do not participate in offensive behavior that may be degrading to other members or even yourself. Please try to police your own actions or they may be reviewed for guild disciplinary actions by our officers. <br>
<br>
Some of the more serious offenses are kill stealing, deliberate deception and any attempt to defraud guild members as well as other players. Our guild members should adhere to the General Guidelines as indicated by Verant. Lying, undermining other members, begging or leaving your wiped out group without offering to help are examples of conduct we wish not have associated with At Deaths Door. When in doubt about a conduct issue, contact a guild officer for advice - &quot;Ignorance&quot; is not a viable excuse. <br>
<br>
Its every guild members duty to act as a guild custodian and police not only your own, but others actions of guild members. Please be discreet when handling these situations and not openly berate members in an open guild chat forum unless no other recourse is available. <br>
<br>
Use common sense when dealing with problems with guildmates and others. Try to solve any problems that you may encounter on your own at first. If you cannot, then please get an officer involved before making snap decisions. Disbanding from the guild &amp;#147;in the heat of the moment&amp;#148; is frowned upon and likely you will not get a re-invite. Disbanding from the guild will result in the loss of all GPK points. <br>
<br>
At Death&amp;#146;s Door does not condone a player having characters in a variety of guilds and require that all characters are associated with this guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
******<br>
<br>
I too feel sorry that this happened, for Maeve and also for my former guildmates who joined ADD and are now caught in the middle. I have had only one issue with one member of ADD personally, and to me, it did not reflect on the guild. To me, the character and reputation of Radiant and those members I value highly, and for them to blast ADD for wrongdoing says something to me...<br>
<br>
it happened...<br>
<br>
I had heard about the Rage thing the other morning, as I logged on just after Rage went down at 5am. I was surprised there wasn't a flame about it, since Rage is a favorite topic of conversation on the boards. But I know there wasn't one... Radiant has class, and respect for others. For there to be an all out explosion towards ADD and Maeve actually flaming (nice one by the way), there is a reason. <br>
<br>
I am unsure why the cleric in ADD has had such trouble with getting Rage. If it's true that he is left to camp there for days on end alone, that is most likely the reason. Camping Ragefire requires support from the whole guild, and if ADD, with their numbers and strength would put even half of their guild to camp with him, he would get it in no time. <br>
<br>
I am sad to see such things going on, and it's too bad with all the zones in Norrath and on the moon, there are still issues with people taking advantage of someone else's hard work, instead of going elsewhere to make their own successes.<br>
<br>
(edit<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ah, some characters wigged out on pasting over, sorry for the mangling of the rules) <p><BR>

<br>
ADD has a horrible rep on this server and they have now seemed to accept it and will justify it anyway that they can to get what they want. <br>
<br>
I'd like to see Verbo's log. Although these things can be modified to show what you want. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font> <br> <br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
