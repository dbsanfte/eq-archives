<br>
Raiding's reasons for taking my account for about six days (i didnt play for a week, when i went to log on the pw was changed, I had it back instantly...)<br>
<br>
I'll explain it now from the best of my memory , i dont rememeber lots of stuff. drugs are bad, mmkay.<br>
<br>
Just forewarning, I do not hate raiding for what he did, he fucked with me and then when confronted as soon as I found out, he returned it ... and if he didnt, I had found out exactly where he lived, and told him plane tickets were cheap QQ <br>
<br>
it goes back to my eyepatch of Plunder, and the days that anarchy contained was in chat channels .. june. Mid June. I gave Raiding my PW so he could play act, I would play a cleric  .... well, the night after servers went down, i went home after that instead of logging back on. During that time, an incident occured with Sendole , and waelon when lodi finally did show up (and i missed it QQ) and waelon looted lodi map peice, when he wasnt suppost to (he's a good guy and is too loyal, but he isnt very smart ... he'll listen w/o questioning tho) - this caused Ashraven to remove the parties involved .. erm, let's see .. sendole, raiding (gnibblet), ... waelon ... maybe more, cant remember. <br>
<br>
Raiding was pissed, due to the fact he didnt do anything - he knew he could exact his revenge using my character. So, he later logged on acturian, and used what little knowledge he had of what I had and have done with people, and asked for various gifts back, took a shit fit on ash and another officer, degeared act, made a mule on his account, x'fer'd all my gear to mule, then Zeidane, then a mule, then a Zeidane account mule . How do I know? I found out with  a GM admin at a later date when i couldn't find my rubi greaves (which raiding forgot about, which were returned) but I degress.<br>
<br>
I sat there trying to figure out what he had changed my PW to ... i tried his GF's name , a few other things, then I realized I didnt know enough about him - so I did a little research, and in 5 hours i knew everything about him, from his hair color to his girlfriend's bra size. He logged on MSN later, we had a nice little chat, and while we were talking ... wtf, i get messaged by Casey and Greg (Temeras  and Salival) ... i was pretty much like wtf .... they joined the chat, told raiding to wake the fuck up, I hadn't ever done anything, and to give me my account back. My account was then returned, and my items as well - I lost four yellows of EXP,but it didint matter, i had it traced and shrugged it off. Raiding has since been working his ass off to rebuild my trust with him , he's taught me a few lessons, and that whole &quot;friends close enemies closer&quot; bullshit came up and scared me lol.<br>
<br>
That is how they met. From there, they found out they lived near each other, and the rest of the story follows as raiding has explained. I had no idea about casey until Arreanor, an old friend (for awhile, until he suddenly decided I was scum) told me who and what casey was - at the time I was unsure at best ... it occured during a hole raid , going after kirn for canib, my power was going out repeadely, and we had wiped... the next morning I removed casey, and later on removed canib , cierrien, nadeana, zeidane, and raiding . They all understood that They couldn't be there with casey around. When they asked casey to leave, im told he didnt leave on good terms with anyone. He stole about 200k from Canib, Cierrien, Nadeana, and Zeidane from when they would do Lodizal with his ranger / shaman (Skytso AKA Temeras, Khatup AKA Elof) . Then, he took Raiding's emails, a few accounts to various services, and his paypal ... if memory serves correct, when he showed me the multiple transactions, he lost ... 570 and a few cents, casey had attempted to draw more then what was actually there. <br>
<br>
<br>
That's about all I know, i might have missed some. If you've any questions or concerns about anything I said, email me or send a T in game, im more then likely on my monk who remains semi anonymous, just contact a Revi member and say your looking for me, i'll get the tell. <br>
and yes my pw's been changed =P it's a string of gibberish from cereal boxes, computer parts, and car model numbers. lol =P<br>

"Shepherds we shall be,<br>
For thee, my Lord, for thee.
<br>
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand,<br>
So feet may swiftly carry out Thy commands.
<br>
We will flow a river forth to Thee,<br>
 And teeming with souls shall it ever be."
