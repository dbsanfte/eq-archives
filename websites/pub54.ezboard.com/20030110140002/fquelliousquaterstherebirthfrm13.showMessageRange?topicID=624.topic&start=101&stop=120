I think it was Myga.. about 18 months ago.. old wraith.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since for some reason this hasn't been locked, I'll point out one of the cases of selective memory. <br>
<br>
It was much less than 18 months ago, and it was not &quot;old Wraith&quot;. Try a couple of months ago. I believe it was the first server reset Emp spawn after we failed to reach an agreement on an Emp rotation (everyone, notice the use of &quot;we&quot; there). We clear to the insig room, I turn artound to open the back door to let in a guildie who had been LD, and who do I see? Moncleared and his merry band following us up. We had more people in the zone, and were clearly moving on Emp, yet Wraith/Reviv moved as well. I believe that qualifies.<br>
<br>
Now that that uis out of the way, please lock this. The longer it stays here, and the more that Gurunt and company go back and forth, the more shit that's gonna get dragged up. The more flames and trash talking there is, the more likely to bring others into this mess that have stayed out up till now (like me!). <br>
<br>
Wyen said it well (Desi too by agreeing and backing him up. OMG Wraith and LC agreed!!!!). Let it die. Yea, I know I dragged it out, but I asked it to be locked last night to prevent more shit, and it was locked for maybe an hour, then unlocked to grow by 2 more pages. <br>
<br>
It seems to me that the mods enjoy watching Wraith and LC flame each other and risk hurting the working relationship that has been worked out between the leadership. Hope you enjoy it when/if everything goes to hell and our guilds get to race each other again. I'll be able to point to this thread as part of the reason if that happens. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://i.xanga.com/lfanninc/tattlelc.jpg "/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I didn't miss the point on the Emperor issue.  I figured you said it well enough yourself that you werent part of any rotation so you didn't break any rotation.  But then thats kind of like saying cutting in line doesnt count for you cause you aren't a part of the line.  More power to you but the people in line sure aren't going to like you for it or agree with you and you need to understand that.  And back then the rotation was a bit different from what it was when we offered Wraith a spot in it.  And you quite clearly attempted to paint out the rotation that LC has set up and tried to maintain as something evil and something that was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>forced</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> upon you.<br>
<br>
As to insulting you over not agreeing to the rotation I dont know.  I never heard it.  Maybe it was in tells who knows.  But Wraith has given their fair share of insults and bullshit over shout and auction (yes the NEW Wraith as you like to blame everything bad on the old Wraith) that you cant be complaining.<br>
<br>
And as for painting you greedy for offering us the loot and rifts from emp as part of your bargain.  I never did.  But then I never knew about that.  But now that I do I am a little more ticked off at your leadership for trying to bribe us with loot.  I dont know about you but I like most of the high end game because of the fights.  Not just because of the loot.  Albeit we did accept VM's offer of Blood loot when they wanted an extra shot at Emp way back before either of us had killed Emp and we wanted the day to go somewhere else instead of being stuck in Ssrae to make our Emp attempt. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So that worked out nicely for both guilds.<br>
<br>
And yes our 'kids' flame Wraith and others a lot on this flame board.  So do yours.  Guess what else Gurunt?  You and I are 'kids' too in the same fashion.  WTF do you think we've been doing on this thread?  Get a freaking clue and quit trying to act like youre above all of it when youre right down here with everyone else.<br>
<br>
As to whether or Delores has any interest in working with others peaceably that's for her to respond to.  but I didn't see any indication (and have not) that she is against any of the rotations we have now.  And as you said she is not in charge.  So it doesn't really matter does it?<br>
<br>
Also once again you say that Delores plays at the expense of others and you continue to show your ignorance and obvious lack of attention to what I and she said in our posts.  She wants to win and be first etc etc.  As I am sure the vast majority of us want to be.  Will it probably make her happy if we get all the PoP server firsts because it means Wraith didn't?  Probably.  Just like I am sure a lot of your guildies are happy and thrilled that you got Emp dead before VM and are going to get to play in Vex Thall now.  Should we say everyone that plays a professional (or recreational) sport that has a winner and a loser is playing at the expense of others?  It's the same concept<br>
<br>
Yes people like Salta and in this case Delores are probably a large cause of the mudslinging on these boards.  On the flip side it's people like you and I who keep it going and add to it tenfold every single time.  See my fourth paragraph.<br>
<br>
And as to it all making the work of the 'grownups' in LC and Wraith that much harder I dont see why it would.  If youre so much more 'mature' then you should have learned to ignore shit like this by now.  I'm sure these flame threads have no effect on Bine whatsoever as I doubt she even comes to these boards.  The only way it would affect anything is if the leadership of said guilds ... hmm ... took part in the mudslinging and let it affect their judgement.<br>

Off topic <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  the correct phrase is 'i couldn't care less'  because, see, if you could care less then that means you do care because you could care less than what yuo do now.

It seems to me that the only opinions Wraith holds in any esteem are its own so again I ask why does my view on the sitation matter to you?<br>
<br>
So since we don't see eye to eye on emperor go ahead and forget I even made reference to it in my post.  There's still a whole lot of stuff there that wasn't even addressed.  I found it pretty funny that I pointed out you broke rotation on emp/creator and then went on to claim you had never broken rotation on ntov/cursed/emp.  Subtle way of completely dodging the intent of my point eh?  It's cool to break rotation on the smaller stuff like creator but as long as you're angels about the emp ntov and cursed everything will be great! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=saltamontes@quelliousquaterstherebirth>Saltamontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=Green>Moderator</font></span><br>  Posts: 556<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/31/02 8:47:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=108>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> PS</span><hr size=1> I was the one that originally tried locking the thread after a response by Desi/Gurunt but it seems as though someone else feels it's more important to keep the wound open. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=warlordette>Warlordette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>F Salta!!!</span><br>  Posts: 251<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/31/02 8:52:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=109>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lotus Cult and Wraith - please check this.</span><hr size=1> I told ya this would never work raalf <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Far from true--this is the kind of drama that chased me away from the game, and that keeps me away today--even though I really enjoyed playing as long, and as much as I did.<br>
<br>
Led you know I have nothing but respect for you and I do my best to stay <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>unbiased</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on all of this mess.<br>
<br>
But just because it's drama, or it's not going anywhere, or it's a flamefest, or it's pointless..<br>
<br>
those are all opinions--<br>
<br>
I realize Raalf probably didnt expect this to turn into what it is, but locking threads just because you, me, or anyone else doesnt like where they are going is just wrong....<br>
<br>
It sets an example that is impossible to call a standard because it is based on the mood/opinion of the individuals with access to the &quot;lock/delete&quot; button.<br>
<br>
I realize it out and sucks (in my opinion, of course) but there is nothing really that can be done about it that would be done what I would consider to be &quot;fair&quot;.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind its been no less than a week now that everyone cried out censorhip over the spoiler incident; again a very opinionated topic and after we worked it out-well, you see where it is.<br>
<br>
On a side note: Why dont you have your respective officers just have a &quot;stay out of flamefests on qc policy&quot; if that is what you want. Back in the days on everlore,  we had a pretty similiar policy and it worked out pretty well. <br>

<br>
<br>
I agree my posting here just keeps this turning.  I should know better than to think there is any middle ground, or that negative attidutes are going to change.   I give up.   Keep hating us, as long as there are reasonable people in charge of LC it doesn't much matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kailynn made a very interesting point probably without realizing it.   When wraith offered thier first Emp loot to LC in exchange for 2 day berth on Emperor to learn him, it was considered a &quot;bribe&quot;.   When Vis did the same thing, it was great.   This is one core problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rotations are player made.  If you are not part of it you cannot break them.   How many rotations did LC break when they split from the old QQ?   Does it matter?   Does it make you worse people?  No you were totally justified in what you did, it was totally different than us negotiating with the rotation you offered.  This is the you kill it first so you feel you own it syndrome.  What matters is we worked things out.  We had 2 tame races and worked it out, that a good thing.   Come on.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Salta...  Creator was never on rotation, not with us.  I, me, personally, screwed up one time when Bine asked for a creator that day... the message never got passed to Biffins and I went afk for about an hour and something was going on in the real world keeping my attention and  5-6 hours after Bine asked for that shot Wraith was in jail and it hadn't sunk in to me until Bine sent me a tell, and I spent the next few days apologizing for screwing up.   That was miscommunication, was my fault, I owned up to that months ago.   On your boards I posted directly that it was completely my fault.<br>
<br>
So, we are chastised for breaking a fictional rotation.  Not just one we aren't in, but one that does not and did not exist at all.  Pattern forming?<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, this is nothing, there is no reason for this bad blood.   There just is bad blood because people want it that way. <p>Gurunt Bangoo &lt;Wraith&gt;<br>

It was loot in exchange for a bonus emperor shot.   Least that's what was posted.  Granted  vis offered blood loot and we offered emperor loot... but same principal..... bribe is a bribe if it's being looked at that way.<br>

<br>
I simply was asking for some cheese selcetions that I might enjoy.  I would appreciate if we could talk more about the cheese and less about a set of pixels.  The cheese tastes better.  Here, I'll start:<br>
<br>
recipe for cheese dip:<br>
10 oz. can rotel diced tomato and green chilies<br>
1lb. block velveeta mild mexican cheese<br>
2 tbsp. flour or corn starch (to thicken)<br>
<br>
melt all contents together in a double boiler (so you dont scortch the cheese)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Havusin's Triscuit Surprise:<br>
1 Box of Triscuits (placed randomly on a paper plate)<br>
1 Bag Shredded Cheese (pick yer poison)<br>
1 Bottle Caesar Dressing<br>
<br>
Place crackers on a paper plate in a haphazard fashion.  Sprinkle shredded cheese over the entire plate.  Nuke on high power for a good 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
When removing contents from microwave, Havusin says to be careful, because the cheese can be &quot;hot&quot;.<br>
<br>
Drizzle caesar dressing over the top of your creation and enjoy. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/tfossick/tunsig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
