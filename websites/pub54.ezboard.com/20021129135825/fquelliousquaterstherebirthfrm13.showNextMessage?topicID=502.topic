It was what clerics needed.<br>
<br>
I agree with Verant's stance of trying to lessen the dependancy for clerics in raids and trying to diversify their solo and group roles.<br>
<br>
Most old clerics are tired of being CH monkeys.  Most raid leaders are tired of needing CH bots.<br>
<br>
Clerics are still needed for raids, but with the druid and shaman CH coming in soon, the pressure should be lessened a bit.  That's a rather pre-emptive statement though; we'll see how the heals work out.<br>
<br>
So far no expansion has really &quot;expanded&quot; class roles.  My personal opinion is that expansion should come in the form of new abilities, new functionality and new content designed to take advantage of said functionalities.  Instead of inventing new functionality, Verant cross-breeds it within the classes, which is unhealthy for the most part.  All that is due to their lack of originality.<br>
<br>
I'm a 60 cleric.  I've played around with the new abilities.  I am not a monk, warrior, or enchanter by any means.  With these changes I'm not a complete solo exping machine as many seem to think clerics are now.  I could solo quite well before the patch.<br>
<br>
I am not necessarily a &quot;better&quot; soloer.  I just have another style of soloing added to my repetoire.  It's not necessarily more efficient, it may be worse, but its an option.  And might I add, a fun option.<br>
<br>
The vast majority of clerics who liked to group before are still going to like to group.  The only difference now is that if no one wants to group with them they have a viable alternate option.  Also if they don't have time for an extended grouping session, they have the option to log in, chill out, and solo some.<br>
<br>
All depends on the cleric's style.<br>
<br>
Before the patch, clerics were the worst soloing class of them all (read: most clerics have never enjoyed the soloing option AT ALL, no matter how inefficiently) and the clerics who had the balls, skills, or gear to solo semi-efficiently were only a small portion of the cleric population.<br>
<br>
For all of you afraid that clerics are suddenly going to stop grouping so they can run off and solo, you're nuts.  If a cleric wants the group, and the group wants a cleric, the cleric will group.  If a cleric wants to solo, now the cleric can solo, instead of being forced to have to choose the group scene.<br>
<br>
You think clerics BELONG in groups?  Cuz that's how its always been?  Cuz its TRADITION?  Cuz YOU need them?  Well, all I can say to that is fuck off and deal with your envy/jealousy or whatever personal problem you have with seeing others accomplish anything that doesn't benefit you directly as well.<br>

Tell that to a warrior.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with clerics getting soloability... I do think each class should be able to solo at least somehow...  but I think personally it came from the wrong direction and infringes upon paladins far too much. I think better spells would have been the answer, make them more powerful casters. I know they already have not-bad nukes against undead, so why not have gone with that and made them virtual wizards against undead? There are quite a few zones that this would have made soloing viable (and, no, I don't see a problem with making x class only viable for soloing in y zone - druids sure cant quad-kite indoors).  <p><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22703"

<br>
You are so wrong.....Rogues &amp; Warrirors are much worse solo'ers than clerics.  A cleric could take down a mob at 54 that a warrior cannot do at 60 (with nice gear).  <br>
<br>
I can now easily solo a skeletal guardian in karnor with my cleric without problems, I cant with my warrior - well I can do it better now with Sapper.  <br>
<br>
I have made a point previously that a cleric can easily handle 5-6 mobs in Lguk (that are blue / hard green) at once.  <br>
<br>
The melee option for them will predominantly be for solo'ing purposes only.  <br>

I could solo undead very well before the patch, as I stated.  I have above average gear, however.  Clerics in general, though, certainly have the potential to be better soloers with the changes, on that point I agree.  You took me out of context is all.<br>
<br>
I disagree about clerics being better soloers than warriors pre-patch.  Maybe Answer, Elsatia, or Nvenia can solo undead better than Raluvin but that is hardly a good example.  If you compare how I solo compared to someone like Brutalone or Dachunker, there is quite a huge difference and we're same tier gear-wise.<br>
<br>
Warriors with proper soloing gear (read: fungi, damage shield gear, lifetap/rune/slow/primal weapons, max hastes, whatever) do just fine.  Same with rogues.  Both melee classes more easily and naturally come upon the gear required for them to solo throughout the course of their careers.<br>
<br>
The point about clerics and paladins is very good.  I would personally rather be more magically capable than melee capable...the &quot;wizard of undead,&quot; as it was put.  <br>
<br>
I can assure you, though, there is still a very large gap between cleric melee and paladin melee and also cleric and paladin soloing efficiency overall.  At my best soloing efficiency (pre-patch, using spells, not melee (note<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ost-patch I still solo more efficiently with spells)), Eroin still killed undead 3 times as fast as me.  New cleric melee pales in comparison to a similarly equipped paladin (on a non-undead mob) and absolutely pales in comparison to a Slay Undead 3 paladin (on an undead mob).<br>

<br>
Personally, I think manaburners have a right to defend their endowment as well as anyone else if they are attacked for using (or misusing) it.  Problem is, this change isn't nearly so exploitable, yet people attack it the same way.  You won't see 6 clerics getting together with their Hammers of Judgement, their Yaulp 5, and their Bash skill to melee down Talendor any time soon.<br>

Chunker and Brutalone....mmmmm some of the best equipped warriors on the server.  <br>
<br>
Raluvin = one of the better equipped warriors on the server.  <br>
<br>
I cannot see how I would be considered to be a poor example.  I am prolly in the top 10% (but not in the top 2%) of well equipped warriors. <br>
<br>
Yes there will come a point when warriors will POTENTIALLY solo better than clerics with the damn right equipment, but Brutalone /smack the dorf and Chunker /smack the fatty <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> these 2 are poor examples of this if anything.<br>
<br>
As I have said I have BOTH a cleric and a warrior.  I can give you both points of view.  Raluvin has much much superior equipment to Kala, hes much higher in level - he also has 21 AA points.  He has full velious armour (SS/Champs and Warlord) has a CoF and Willsapper and epic offhand and decent miscellaenous equipment.<br>
<br>
Kala is now 57 has full thurgy armour and a few half-decent miscellaneous items.<br>
<br>
Ever since 54 without this upgrade, whos been the better solo'er ?<br>
<br>
My cleric has.<br>
<br>
I aint pointing out flaws in your comments, I aint attacking you - I am giving a factual point of view from both a warriors and a clerics perspective.  <br>
<br>
If you could put yerself next to the average warrior and average cleric - you would prolly find yourself agreeing with me. <br>

Everything depends on your gear, where as cleric its more about skill. Without an occasional heal from a sympathetic onlooker my warrior ass would be sitting down for 30 min just to get my health back up enabling me to solo..one more.<br>

Im glad they nerfed the hammer, it was ridculous, I couldnt even count how many times it proc'd in one fight.

Kill them all!!!</span><hr size=1> I Totally agree with Answer on this one!  Cleric power!<br>
<br>
<br>
While I can understand some of the concerns and complaints and infringements on other classes, this anti-cleric soloability flaming crap makes me pissed as all hell.<br>
<br>
THis is the most exciting thing that ever happened to my class in my entire 3 year EQ life!!!!!!!  I had so so so much godamn fun after that first patch.  I could actually kill things efficently.  I even killed an assload of people in the arena (im a cleric like wtf??! =P).<br>
<br>
<br>
First off let me tell you what I agree with:<br>
<br>
Paladins and warriors feeling threatened at lower levels does in fact have some validity to it.  A 56 cleric can now knock out 35 DPS with a 5pp spell, continously kill mobs and heal themselves as well.  <br>
<br>
This is a bit harsh for Paladins and warriors as these classes are completely dependant on thier gear.  They must have good haste, weapons, armor, and at least a Kunark heal BP to compensate them for thier downtime.  These classes will have to work very hard for efficient soloing buy spening a lot of cash for nice gear, whereas a cleric innately gets this for 5pp.<br>
<br>
ok so they have it hard, and ability to solo comes from a heavy reliance on gear..... is this not also true for clerics?  maybe not entirely, but you are comparing apples and oranges here.<br>
<br>
Those same warriors who cannot solo well becasue of not owning uber gear fall in the same boat as a 56 cleric.  Most 56 clerics do not have amazing gear, if anything a cleric only begins to raid around this level.  Will a cleric with 950 ac and 2500 hp fully buffed, no access to avatar, owning maybe 1 FT item, with thier horrible dodge and defense skills be able to solo like a lvl 60 cleric who has been raiding for years?<br>
<br>
  hell no!<br>
<br>
This 56 cleric is gonna have to work a LOT harder to keep up some sort of efficency.  If you read the cleric boards the lower end clerics are using half of thier mana still to solo a blue mob with this hammer and using yaulp5.  I would venture to say a large portion of the cleric community who has jsut gotten this spell does not solo nearly as efficently as you think.  <br>
<br>
I Like to solo sometimes, usually when I want to be left alone.  I have run into Answer, Nvenia, and Erion in there soloing the undead section.  Nvenia and Answer both have a very nice right clickable DoT cleric only item from Ssra which they are able to solo about 8 spawns continously with.  I can handle 4 without this item.  Whether it is root rotting, or using a lot of melee tricks and swapping out 3 weapons and using damage shields it has the same result for me  (this is months ago, not after this patch).<br>
<br>
Eroin walks in (A PALADIN), who is on about the same gear level as Nvenia and Answer (I would say I fall in a few steps behind from all 3 gearwise).  Eroin using slay undead was able to completely slaughter every undead spawn in there...<br>
<br>
It looked something like this:<br>
Slash, Slash, 4k crit, Slash, 800 crit, Slash 1200 Crit, DEAD!..<br>
<br>
poor paladins....<br>
<br>
Do you realize clerics cannot do anythign remotely that powerful?  yes we can CH, yes we can CH, oh yes and we can CH... I got CH 3 years ago, it still is CH, it does not do anything more than it ever did but CH.  All the melees scaled insanely in power since 1999, as well as casters.  Wizards got this nuke called Icecomet back then.  That spell is now complete garbage to what they have now.  Clerics still have Ch guys =).<br>
<br>
Clerics have been in a serious need of something, anything for years now.  The only upgrades we have gotten are in the forms of heals and buffs, and a few gay spells that no one uses.  <br>
<br>
Why can't people just embrace this and say &quot;wow omg! people like to play clerics again!&quot;<br>
<br>
I saw so many old clerics dusted off for this and had lots of conversations filled with excitement to friends who were enjoying playing again.<br>
<br>
How many clerics are in your guilds, and how many of them think the end all of be all is sitting in a CH chain while watching people who actually do damage kill something?  I am suree there are plenty, but I would venture that there are more who wanted something like the change we got, Something radical and different that breathes new life into such a dead class.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, the nerfed it.  Its over.  The new summoned hammer is about as effective as any other weapon  I possess now.  The proc is resisted, does not come very often any longer, and I still miss 4 out of 5 swings with 1100 attack and 255 str 255 dex etc....<br>
<br>
<br>
Make sure to rub it in please that its gone.  Make sure you put the cleric back in his place, which is usually in a CH chain on a raid, or buffing and rezzing all the soloers in most experience zones.  Or where they just leech experience, throw a heal every 5 minutes, and desperately try to get one nuke in (the only nuke they have, the one with the 7 second casting time) before the mob dies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Elsatia <br>
<br>
&quot;desperately searching the spellbook for SOMETHING to cast other than a heal which will help a group&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
Flame on guys, down with the cleric, up with the &quot;my class has only been rebalanced 13 times now, wtf i want 15&quot; attitude.<br>

<br>
Clerics ALREADY soloed better then wars, based on SPELLS that are vendor bought. Do not compare a vendor bought spell to the gear of LC/Vis wars soloing, that is moronic.  The excuse that mobs are resistant to magic too hard to solo.. hey , ever heard of a jouneymans walking stick?<br>
<br>
You have got to be kidding me... How many clerics at eqclerics whine about &quot;ohhh but eq was so boring&quot;.. Try playing a warrior, everything we do is dependant on CLERICS. <br>
   <br>
Every solo fight is a roll of the not so great random number generator for wars.. Clerics could solo/group and add in strategy and tactics with their spells other then heals already.. Bored that your only casting heals in groups? Maybe you should look the other 100 spells you have in your spellbook.<br>
<br>
I feel for sk's and pallys. Last night how many of you were wondering, Hmm what is the point of a pally now? <br>
Oh but they crit for 4500 on undead?  Yeah, thats nice.. they can spike damage on one type of mob...<br>
<br>
Then the Sk's get taunt NERFED with the patch that war's thought would end their tanking role.. Thats just great, nerf the old taunt spells but &quot;forget&quot; to put in the new ones. <br>
<br>
So, anything in the cleric epic take over a group or two now? Any single spawn over 24 hours?  Freebringer 2.0..<br>

<br>
Lets break this down.<br>
<br>
Cleric pet (new and improved).  Still has 100hp.  Still uncontrollable.  This means if at any time the cleric needs to root the mob to step back and heal himself, the pet is likely to get creamed.  Still poofs after a cleric is free of hate lists.  I would personally rather have a pet I could control and which was persistant rather than the one I have now.  SK pet would be just dandy.<br>
<br>
Snare and Fear.  First of all, in a solo situation, fear is nigh worthless without snare to control it.  Dark Elves of Innoruuk have available to them a quest for a necklace that casts a 30 second Snare.  All other cleric races have nigh no use for fear in a solo situation, unless they have a Sap Encrusted Branch, a little gem of a 1hb that drops off Tunare and procs Ensnare in battle.  No, many clerics do not have this Mipp, even in the high end game.  And if you want to count the Sap Encrusted Branch as a cleric's snare ability, count it as a warrior's snare ability too.<br>
<br>
Divine Aura/Divine Barrier/Bestow Divine Aura.  These are not make or break tools for consistent soloing.  If a warrior needs to run I believe he has tools available to him...the universal Run 3 or Journeyman's Boots.<br>
<br>
Rezzing is also not a soloing tool.  I don't go into a fight planning to die.  It's a convenience if something goes horribly wrong.  Having resurrection at my fingertips does not make me a better soloer.<br>
<br>
Journeyman's Walking Stick...Sap Encrusted Branch...very useful items indeed...if your dex is high enough to make them a viable tool that is.  So you've placed another condition on a cleric's power.  Now the cleric has to be primal as well to fit the broadest ranges of your argument.  Even in the high end game, primal clerics are quite rare I assure you.<br>
<br>
So...what meaningful solo tools are left in your shoddy run-down?  The newly nerfed hammer (not worth mentioning now) and hey...our 925 nuke (325mana/4.0 casting/9.5 recast).<br>
<br>
Clerics can solo 3 primary ways.<br>
<br>
Root/Nuke.  Hope you have FT10 or greater if you want any measure of efficiency out of this.<br>
<br>
Root/DoT Undead.  Hope you have Hammer of the Sun if you want any measure of efficiency out of this.<br>
<br>
Melee Undead.  Hope you have fungi, primal, coldain ring 8+, Eyepatch of Plunder, and Dawnfire - Morningstar of Light, if you want a SHRED of a PRAYER of ANY efficiency out of this.<br>
<br>
So yep, even with our spells we are sub-par soloers.  Takes a commitment to gear AND skill to climb out of the dredges of innefficiency.<br>
<br>
Is all this achievable for a cleric?  Yes.  Is it achievable for a warrior?  Again, yes.<br>
<br>
And Mipp, I can tell you are completely ignorant of the tribulations of being stuck in the CH rut so I won't bother to respond to your mocking clerics getting bored.<br>
<br>
As far as you feeling completely dependent upon a cleric, I can't personally help that.  I know, however, that it is a vestige of Velious days.  If you've gotten far into Luclin (and work on AA), you'd see that druids and shamans are much more efficient in normal exp groups and duos.  The shaman makes up for the lack of CH with slows and increases the DPS with a measure of haste, ATK buffs, and DoTs.  The druid makes up for lack of CH with the raw DPS of damage shields and DoTs.  In both cases the mob is dying faster and overall less healing is needed because the fight is shorter than it would be pairing with a cleric instead.  The net result is faster kills with no loss of efficiency.<br>
<br>
That's what an old cleric sees when he goes looking for a group.<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, your feeling of bitterness about cleric depency is based on the raid game.  Well, tough shit, clerics depend on you too there.  And most of us would be happy if it didn't take so damn many of us to support you.  Not your fault, of course, I just think its obvious you're misdirecting your bitterness in that case.  <br>
<br>
Bah.  Topic's dead now.<br>
<br>
Take heart soloing warriors of Craptacularity, the cleric shall not rise beyond ye in the end.<br>
