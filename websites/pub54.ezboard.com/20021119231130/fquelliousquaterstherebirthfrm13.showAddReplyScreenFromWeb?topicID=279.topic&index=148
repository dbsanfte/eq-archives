GMs did check the log and there was NO ks. The shissar was NOT agroed by Radiant according to the gm that talked to Qindien. I am not sure if this was ultimate authority since it all happened while i slept but i was told logs were indeed checked for it and there was no sign of any KS. Qindien gets to keep the epic.

Its my word against their's, but never the less some things need to be said.<br>
<br>
First of all, you're right. &quot;Radiant&quot; didn't aggro the Shissar first, Bippity did. Bippity is a member of Fallen Eagles. If they are checking the aggro based on guild membership, then no Radiant won't come up as having aggro first. Bippity was a representative of our raid.<br>
<br>
Secondly, if ADD had a spotter in Fear well then by golly they must have that neat little GM trick of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not showing up in the who list!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This is a bold faced lie. There were no ADD people in Fear until 4pm, either anon, roleplay or otherwise.<br>
<br>
Spawn negotiation: I want to make this very clear. I did not receive a tell until 3-3:30pm PDT (thats pacific daylight time). When I did receive a tell from Banelion he did indeed say &quot;Lets work something out.&quot; To which I replied &quot;Yes, lets.&quot; With the full intention of telling him our way of working it out would be to kill the mob we intended to kill. He replied suggesting we roll for the mob, and I balked. ADD had only <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> just then</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> gathered force in Feerott to zone in. I don't care what ~any~ member of ADD says, you were NOT gathered as a force until at LEAST 3:30pm and did NOT zone in until at LEAST 4pm. We had been in the zone and ressing/clearing for 2 BLOODY HOURS. And no, Radiant did NOT wipe out 2 times going in. We ran in once, got a resser camped out. Monks collected corpses. At 2pm did this cr start and at 2:45 did we begin to wrap it up.<br>
<br>
At no time did I &quot;stall&quot; with Banelion or act in a disrespectful manner. I clearly and politely told him that Radiant had cleared roamers and was going to pull temple to engage the Wraith of Shissar. He said &quot;Then it will be a competition, who ever gets the kill first wins.&quot; This is when they zoned in and I kicked up the pace.<br>
<br>
I won't get into who aggro'd/pulled the Shissar first, because I already know that was Bippity and believe her implicitly. Anyone who says otherwise needs their head checked.<br>
<br>
Given this next comment, I wouldn't be surprised if Verbo lied to his own guild about how it went down:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I spent 40 mins sending tells to twistadowhoever. I tried to resolve the situation as best I could and even talked to bip. Banelion then took up the task after twistadowhoever told me to fgk off<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Verbo, you are a liar. I never received one tell from you during this whole incident. I don't know what else to say to this.<br>
<br>
How did Trist know that our camp got trained?<br>
Because I saw the Shissar flap past me, saw Bippity /ooc &quot;You took my pull&quot; and attempted to chain stun the Shissar to regain aggro. I watched the entire fight, up till the point where one of your pullers brought in a shiteload of Amygdalan Knights and proceeded to wipe you out (kudos ADD kiters). I ran back to our camp on my horse to help Eadric with the Amys he had taken off me shortly before he died, I then ran those to our camp and died there. Do not blame me for the incompetence of your kiters.<br>
<br>
Radiant (including myself) was in Fear by 2pm.<br>
Radiant had roamers clear by 3:30-4.<br>
Radiant pulled Shissar.<br>
ADD KS'd said Shissar.<br>
<br>
There have been no lies, no subterfuge, no nothing except outrage from our side. The fact that you (and I include Banelion in this) attempt to defame our credibility by LYING about what you did in order to justify your actions makes me so f-ing mad.<br>

<br>
At 2:00, when the first group of Radiant was going in (of which Trist was a part), the second group was making its way to the fear portal. I was the leader of this group.<br>
<br>
Maeve was in my group. She running behind me when Caladur mentioned that ADD was thinking about gathering to take the Shissar. He remarked that Bane was doing the asking, at which point I did a /who all bane, and saw you in FG. At that point, I thought it would end. <br>
<br>
I hope ADD is sorry that it didn't.

<br>
&quot;I'm sorry Bane, but you are a liar, if for no other reason than you claim that Maeve was C3'ing you in FG when you were talking to Trist. &quot;<br>
<br>
Im sorry Punkass who doesnt sign his posts but where did you see me state that.<br>
<br>
My statement was put in brackets as to show its not necesarrily directly related to that particular paragraph. What i did say is (just for the record Maeve was casting c3 in Fungus grove on me and my wife when add was already gathering for Shissar). I dont see Trist mentioned at all in relation to this sentence.<br>
<br>
As you say its your word against mine and sadly i can prove it as little as you can prove it so i guess the truth of the matter of our conversation will have to always be judged by each individual himself based on his knowing of you and me.<br>
As for the checking of KSing logs ... i have no idea how they did it or if they checked only against Radiant members ... as i said before not even GMs are perfect and i myself dont claim to be either ... for the sake of the argument it is possible that Verbo did make a mistake and pulled shissar when it was aggroed ... but he was under strict orders not to pull if you had already aggroed and or engaged it ... you read in my post in way i checked with puller if the pull was clear. I think that is all i could have done short of having him give his pass and logging him on myself to do the pull personally. If GMs figure out now that the pull was in any case wrong i will do like i said i would. Even though GM already confirmed Qindien is the rightfull owner according to pnp he is still not allowed to use the item for a while longer in case any leftover info comes to light.<br>

I do not doubt that you are an honorable person Bane. The fact is that your guild- especially regarding their actions in fear- is not. I am willing to accept that you may have mistaken your timeframes, but I cannot understand why you insist that you (and they) are right.<br>
<br>
I'll go through my logs either tonight or Monday and see when the ADD contact was first mentioned in guildchat, and when I zoned in to Feerott. However, I think Bippity's log is crystal clear on this- ADD knew why we were up there, they weren't there while we were clearing, and they then came in and KS'd the mob. Someone told you we had attempted the wraith 4 times already, and that's just bullshit. I wonder how many other lies you were told by your guildies that day? Maybe one involving the agro on the wraith?

Secondly, I am friends with many of the members of ADD. Until now I'd never had a problem with ADD. In fact I've even helped you on some raids without expecting anything in return. For example, at the request of Blal, I came and dropped a manaburn Talendor last week when you were having trouble and declined to roll on any loot because I knew your guilded needed it more than I. However, I do have a problem with the way this incident went down. The actions taken by ADD with reguard to the shissar were at best, very questionable.<br>
<br>
Ya, I'm a member of vis, but unlike what some of you might have heard, we respect the right of any guild/group not named wraith to have first dibs on a mob if they are in or clearly gathering in a zone before us with a sufficient force. Doesn't matter if they are just starting to work their way to a mob. For example, on 4-11-02, Vis was planning on taking the burrower parasite but lotus cult started gathering in the deep before we did. Sure, they only had a small force there at the time, but we respected the fact that they had started to gather in force first and had enough members online and otw to kill the worm. Clearly in this situation with ADD and radiant, reguardless of who's tracking bitch was in the zone first or who tried to stall who, Radiant was gathering at fear and went into fear before ADD. It is also clear that Radiant had a sufficient force to complete their task. Therefor, ADD should have respected this and never even zoned into PoF. At the very least ADD should have allowed Radiant to at least attempt the shissar since they were the first guild to enter.<br>
<br>
I'll give you the benifit of the doubt and allow for the fact that there was possibly some miscommunication between Radiant and ADD. Hindsight is 20/20 and all the facts may not have been clear to both guilds in the heat of the moment. Please try to refrain from getting yourselves into situations such as this ADD. It reflects poorly on your guild and unfortunately, a lot of people here are not nearly as forgiving or permissive as I am.<br>

In the discussion was reported a conversation with a GM who stated that the only things logged were who got the kill, who looted the item and the like.  In particular, the GM said they could NOT determine who had aggro by examining the logs, as they do not contain each and every hit by the players and the mobs. (i'm looking for the thread and will amend this thread when I find it)<br>
<br>
One wonders if the &quot;gm&quot; took the easy route and said &quot;no KS&quot;  even though they had no way to tell.  One also wonders at the speed of this &quot;resolution&quot; and whether or not the GM actually ruled as indicated.  Perhaps someone is trying to spread oil on the waters...<br>
