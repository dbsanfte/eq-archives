I decided to put a part of my life here.<br>
<br>
<br>
My name is Kaerill, I was born under the stars in the beautiful green city of Kelethin.  My birth place, home to the part of me who will always belong to Kelethin and Tunare. <br>
<br>
From birth I was taken away from Kelethin and transplated to Misty.  My parents had perished when my father misjudged the time we would leave Kithcor forest.  He gained enough time for my mother to escape with me to Rivervale.  After leaving me in the arms of the druid who helped her in her last bit of run to safety, my mother run back into the dark trying to save my father.  They were never seen again. <br>
<br>
The sweet druid left me in care of druids of Rivervale.  She came back to visit me often, and from that day forth, she became my mother, sister and friend.  She was always but a call away. <br>
<br>
I was a clumsy child.. it took me a long time to master the arts of being a druid.  Slowly though, I learned and remembered the teachings as they become a part of me.  The druids of Rivervale cared for me well and truly, but yet something is always missing... Rivervale is home to me now.. but it is not where I belong. <br>
<br>
From that point on I journeyed to many places and seen many things... from the West Common Land, East Common Land to the Corrupted City of Freeport. I journeyed beyond into Oasis, South Ro, hoping to see it all.  My feet have touched the beautiful plains of East Karanas, West Karanas, North and South Karanas.  I have swam under the moonlight in the beautiful Lake Rathetears. I even visited my birth place, the strange and tall city of Kelethin and the beautiful High Elf City of Feldwithe.  As I grew wary of the Old Land, wanderlust even took me to FV and beyond into Lake of Ill Omen, Frontier Mountain, Dreadlands and the dreaded Emerald Jungle.  Eventually I even journeyed into the new and dangerous land called Velious, and fall in love with that beautiful white world.  I, a child of the forest, am in love with the icy, wet and cold land called Velious.  As I bath under the icy water from the Thurgadin Fall, I realized I have come home.<br>
<br>
Through my travels, I have been died many times due to my foolishness, but each time the Lady sends me back... telling me it's not my time yet.  So.. I wandered and journey onward and searched.. <br>
<br>
What am I searching for?  What is this force that drives me to travel and not to rest in one place for long?  Who am I looking for?  I am merely a Searcher of the impossible, a wanderer seeking the elusive yet not impossible dream... What is it you asks?  I do not know.. but if I ever find it.. I will let never let it go.<br>
<br>
