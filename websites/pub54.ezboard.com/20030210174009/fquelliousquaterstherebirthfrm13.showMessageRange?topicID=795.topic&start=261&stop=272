<br>
Yep, that that &quot;someone&quot; is the UN, the organization that WE created over 50 years ago to keep THE WORLD in check.<br>
<br>
Imagine for a moment that the governor of Wyoming thought that Canada had the everpopular illegal WMDs and that they were going to use them.  Our federal government can't find any evidence of them, the UN can't find any evidence of them, and Canada is having a hard time proving that they don't have something that doesn't exist.  Should all the higher powers just stand idly by while Wyoming launches an attack on Canada because they think the Grand Canuck is a powerhungry warlord hellbent on destruction?<br>
<br>
This is why the UN was created, so there would be checks in place so one superpower couldn't use their force to govern the entire planet however they felt necessary.<br>
<br>
Now lets look real quick at the two worst &quot;military atrocities&quot; that Iraq has committed that always come up in debates like this.<br>
<br>
They invaded Kuwait.  That's all most people say when they're showing that Iraq is the big bad in the world.  They invaded a small, helpless, more-or-less neutral country.  Now we add a few facts into that statement and...Iraq invaded Kuwait, a small, helpless, more-or-less neutral country !that had for some time freely admitted and even gloated over the fact that they were using methods of drilling to steal oil directly from Iraqi land!.  Now with just a few more facts, we see that Iraq wasn't blindly destroying less powerful countries, they were using military force to protect their land and their interests.  Gee, even our country's leader threatens to use force to protect our land and our interests.  Go figure.<br>
<br>
Then we have the Kurds.  The peaceloving Kurds who were victims of racial genocide.  The Kurds who were ruthlessly killed and possibly exposed to WMDs from Iraq's military.  Er...sorry, I mean the revolutionary Kurds who were trained and armed by the US to use terrorist methods to overthrow their country's government.  <br>
<br>
Just keep in mind that there's really not a whole lot of news anymore, there's just spin.  Remember that we entered into WWII when we stopped shipment of food and oil to Japan, not when they attacked us in retaliation.  Remember that the Confederacy withdrew from the US because laws were being passed that economically crippled the entire south.  Remember that our country itself was founded by vandals and terrorists.<br>
<br>
It's all spin, baby. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=talzarbbh>Talzar BBH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/26/03 12:23:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=262>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OT - Opposed to the war with Iraq?

Many of the people posting here, like too many other people in real life, aren't looking at this the way it should be.<br>
<br>
In 1991 we knew what he had and it is a lot.  The UN knew what he had.  Why didn't anybody bomb it?  He put them under hospitols, mosques and other civilian areas.  Why didn't we go in and do it?  It would be like suicide run into a chemical mousetrap.  This is all public information and facts, not opinion.<br>
<br>
In steps the UN because if the coalition had to do it then it would be a nightmare for both sides.  Everybody wanted the UN to get the job done.  If you think otherwise you are nuts.  Fast forward twelve years and the job still isn't done.  Is it the UN's fault? No, look what they are dealing with.<br>
<br>
Now today it has been twelve years with no results.  How long do you want to wait?  For twelve years he has jerked everybody around.  If the UN doesn't want to be three pages in a tenth grade history book they need to get off their asses because they failed.  I don't &quot;want&quot; a war.  Only crazy people &quot;want&quot; a war.  I hope there isn't one but he left us with no other option twelve years ago.<br>
<br>
For all the &quot;I want proof&quot; people I would suggest you stop listening to these idiot magazine editors and other loud mouths the media gives air time.  There have been some great Defense Department press realeases lately.  Read those because they know a little bit more than some jackass know it all on TV.  I would also leave &quot;proof&quot; people with this...<br>
<br>

You mean allow Saddam to build weapons unchecked?  Diplomacy is 12 years old and still not working... so rule that out... we have  a) enforce the sanctions  b) give up and repeal them<br>
<br>
Option b is not a solution most folks feel acceptable.<br>
<br>
<br>
People disagree right now mainly on when is preventative action justified.  With the weapons capable of being built today, it's a completely different discussion that it was 50 years ago.<br>

<br>
The sanctions in Iraq are far from depriving the people of Iraq from proper care.  Hussein himself has received far too many gifts from the French while he complains his people are starving.  The contradictions are what Baghdad could become with its vast Oil Fields.   History proves Baghdad has untapped resources that could possibly make what it was.<br>
<br>
Why the unthroning of Hussein when the CIA ops him totally predictable and the only reason why is currently still alive?  WE would not invest as much as people think we would as Afghanistan with utterly lack of economic natural resource.  Not only US interests are high in Oil fields,  it is already a fact France and Russia wanted in there and still do.  Iraq over the long hall can support itself while Afghangistan most likely will not.<br>
<br>
For another last general statement on the &quot;Show us the Information&quot;.  On US soil democrats have been on the prowel to sling any mud it can find on this topic.  Why does Bush not want to give them it?  Leaks and security clearances are common sense.  How does the public not put these two togethor is beyond me.  Lets tell them all we know and all our spies are left to die.  Wow, great idea for the war on terror when it co-exists with corrupted governments.  1 +1 = 2  does not apply to disgruntle worldwide politics.  1 + 1000000000000^0 = 2 does apply.<br>

We should stop trying to be the world policeman.  Only reason we should attack anyone is if they attack our citizens, otherwise, let those countries deal with it.  Why should we go somewhere where we are not wanted?  Maybe that will force the Euro Gov'ts to spend more money on defenses.<br>
