I'll try and address the points you raise... I've made these responses before, but anyway, here they are again for your benefit:<br>
<br>
&gt; Were SoTU 'etitled' to Rage when ADD got killed? Imo no. <br>
<br>
Think about the root cause of the problem. It's not about &quot;when ADD got killed&quot;.<br>
At the risk of repeating myself, the issue is who had the right to spawn Ragefire's dragon form in the first instance.<br>
<br>
&gt; Imo BOTH guilds failed to do what we should all do in life <br>
&gt; and in what we do, and thats give other people some <br>
&gt; respect and courtesy.<br>
<br>
Isn't that rather judgemental? For the most part, I've found the ADD members posting on this thread to be as courteous and respectful as can be expected, given that we're disagreeing over an emotive topic.<br>
<br>
Do you think you're showing &quot;courtesy and respect&quot; yourself, by coming in and telling us how we're &quot;both wrong&quot;, and &quot;next time respect one another&quot;?<br>
<br>
*Shrug* as you say, it's a flame board. I suppose I shouldn't complain.<br>
<br>
&gt; SoTU should have stepped back and let ADD have a few fair <br>
&gt; shots at Rage. Hell, maybe even helped out.<br>
<br>
I'm interested in the assumptions behind your statement.<br>
Any reason why that shouldn't be the other way around?<br>
Why shouldn't ADD have helped SoTU?<br>
This comes back to my initial point about who had the right to spawn the dragon in the first place.<br>
<br>
You make reference to rules:<br>
<br>
&gt; And i couldn't care less what verant says their rules are. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure what prompted this comment. The rules are a secondary issue here, and as such I've tried to avoid mentioning them, or using terms like right and wrong, in my posts.<br>
<br>
What *are* the important issues?<br>
- The importance of civil negotiation;<br>
- The importance of getting this quest changed to a less directly confrontational form.<br>
<br>
If you have a moment, please head over to the eqclerics site - their flame board is filled with incidents that amost exactly mirror this one.<br>
<br>
Once again with feeling:<br>
<br>
*The core issue is who had the right to spawn Ragefire in the first place*<br>
<br>
And a suggested solution, once again with feeling:<br>
<br>
*Developers: make the human form of Ragefire as hard to kill as the Dragon*<br>
<br>
...that way, it's much harder to spawn something you can't kill, and the issue of spawn ownership becomes much clearer.<br>
<br>
A last note to the ever-patient Kataar...<br>
<br>
&gt; Hopefully, some of the patient discussion... in this tread will <br>
&gt; help to eliminate the potential for heated incidents like this <br>
&gt; one in the future...<br>
<br>
I'll drink to that. Hopefully the Developers will pay attention, since the problem pops up on other servers as well.<br>

<br>
I have no idea what you are talking about Kruge concerning the negotiation of the spawn.  I was in the zone 5 hrs..never saw the first /ooc or tell.  Divo aws afk part of the time, so any tells sent to him may not have been seen but there were others from his guild in the zone.  So, are you saying all clerics should have to roll on the mob, doesn't matter how long they have camped it?  I thought you were arguing that the cleric with the most capable force there should get it?  Then you insinuated that we didn't have sufficent force, killed the human to spawn/claim the dragon.  I am so sick of this BS...please make up your mind as to what we should have done?  <br>
<br>
As far as the right to the dragon once ADD died...if you have a monk &quot;FD kiting&quot;, you really don't have ownership of the mob according to the rules.  Am I wrong or was it said that kiting a mob didn't constitute ownership?  SotU was NOT actively engaged on the mob when Argille went to PULL.  SotU jumped the mob as it was being pulled to the ADD force.  Why that never came up before...who knows.<br>
<br>
As far as getting personal Kruge and calling your guild and Boni selfish.....well, I call it like I see it.  You guys went in without enough people, you started petitioning as soon as you saw ADD was in trouble, why didn't you petition the GM for who had the rights to the mob to begin with if you had tried negotiating?   You claimed the mob for 15 minutes while ADD was being rezzed and buffed, with your monk &quot;kiting&quot;?  So you claimed a mob you did not have control of?  Then you jumped said mob as it was being pulled because you had &quot;claims&quot; to it.  You keep going back to negoitating the spawn...who tried to negotiate with who and when?  I thought you said you tried to negotiate during  CR, but now it was before the human was engaged?  That human wasn't up 5 minutes hon, when exactly did YOU try to negotiate and what exactly were you wanting?  Boni, Divo and how many other clerics to &quot;roll&quot; on the rights without regard as to who was camping it the longest(lack of respect)?  Please clarify this mess for me since you are so good at it Kruge.   I have no plans to post again on this issue, so forgive me if I don't respond.  You may have the last word Kruge =)<br>
<br>
As far as Divo looting, yes that was wrong.  Personally, I would have let you guys loot it then petitioned the hell out of you for KSing.  That's what you did.   You didn't have control of the mob other than saying it was yours for 15 minutes while the monk &quot;kited&quot; it, and you jumped it as it was PULLED.  <br>
<br>
Verant settled this when Boni got her piece.   Doesn't make it right.  Doesn't make you right Kruge.  Doesn't make Boni less greedy and selfish.  You expected a cleric to give up claims on a mob he had been camping longer by negotiating the rights to it(lack of respect).  You took the dragon when ADD failed because you wanted it(greed).  Boni said she wanted her chance at the dragon(read her last post).  She could have stepped aside and let ADD try again, especially when they were rezzed and buffed.  Boni CHOSE not to...because she wanted HER chance(selfishness and greed).  She wasn't willing to have to camp it again, she wasn't willing to let another cleric complete his fight because VI rules said she didn't have to(lack of respect).  And Boni, if you read this, I don't know you personally, you may the nicest person in EQ but I sure have no respect for what you did that's why I posted this flame to begin with.   I haven't said anything to Boni or anyone in SotU in game other than Andyrl who challenged me to a duel, to which I informed him he'd kick my butt.  <br>
<br>
As to Divo not responding, what did you want him to say...oh btw, it's all good...I don't mind you taking my mob, forcing my friend and guild to defend me, petitioning so I would lose the piece.   He did the right thing by keeping quiet.  Please remember that I started this post and I am NOT a member of ADD.  As to ADD being &quot;childish&quot;, this incident did result in Divo taking a short break.  Obviously Boni didn't concern herself with how Divo felt since she wanted her chance at the dragon and wasn't about to let him try again.  How would any of us feel if someone is rewarded their epic for their selfishness because they USED the rules to justify their behavior and you had to do without your epic and get tagged as a ninjalooter while people choose to ignore the fact that the other person was a KSer (kiting a mob with a monk for 15 mins, then jumping it when it was being pulled)?<br>
<br>
People can make anything sound good, and Kruge is very mannerly and articulate.  But remember, Clinton also didn't have sex with Monica did he =)<br>

I'll respond, although I apologise in advance for the fact that most of this is repetition of what I've said before in response to your various posts.<br>
<br>
&gt; I was in the zone 5 hrs..never saw the first /ooc or tell.<br>
<br>
Your viewpoint (like mine) is highly subjective. Just because you didn't see it, doesn't mean it didn't happen.<br>
<br>
&gt; Divo aws afk part of the time<br>
<br>
He was? I wasn't aware of this - thank you for letting me know. It raises some interesting issues in its own right, don't you think? Is it right to claim a camp while AFK, in your view?<br>
<br>
&gt; Then you insinuated that we didn't have sufficent force, <br>
&gt; killed the human to spawn/claim the dragon. <br>
<br>
I didn't need to rely on insinuation. We've established that you had sufficient force to kill the human, but not the dragon. I'm glad you raised this, though, because it's the point at the heart of the issue.<br>
<br>
&gt; why didn't you petition the GM for who had the rights to <br>
&gt; the mob to begin with if you had tried negotiating?<br>
<br>
Well, we wanted to negotiate, and failed... isn't that self-explanatory? My whole point, through all my posts, is the importance of being able to work things out *without* resorting to GM intervention.<br>
In simple terms, we'd prefer to work it out, player-to-player.<br>
<br>
&gt; Please clarify this mess for me since you are so good at it <br>
&gt; Kruge.<br>
<br>
I can't work out a solution singlehandedly, but I've offered one solution above.<br>
To restate, if the human form of Ragefire was as hard to kill as the Dragon, it would be much less likely that a party would be able to spawn something they can't then kill.<br>
<br>
&gt; Personally, I would have let you guys loot it then petitioned <br>
&gt; the hell out of you for KSing.<br>
<br>
I believe petitions were submitted by both sides.<br>
<br>
&gt; Boni CHOSE not to...because she wanted HER chance<br>
<br>
Don't forget that she offered you a chance first, even though our attempts to negotiate failed.<br>
<br>
&gt; Please remember that I started this post and I am NOT a <br>
&gt; member of ADD.<br>
<br>
I don't mind who you are. Like I've said before, I'm debating opinions, not people or guilds.<br>
<br>
&gt; You took the dragon when ADD failed because you wanted it<br>
&gt; (greed)<br>
<br>
Both parties clearly wanted the Dragon.<br>
I'd assume the motives were similar on both sides... and for that reason, I hesitate to use the term &quot;greed&quot;. It's a two-edged sword, because it applies to everyone.<br>
<br>
&gt; Clinton also didn't have sex with Monica did he =)<br>
<br>
Well, he claimed innocence, and was found guilty by the authorities. From your point of view, this is probably not the ideal analogy...<br>
