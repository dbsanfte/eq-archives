I wonder if VI had any special &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; code alerting them in the event that Sirinab was actually the source of a petition and not the subject of one.<br>
<br>
Kuud sent me a tell trying to recruit for my guild while he was doing his inspection harassment routine on one of my mules that I had running on another box. He's more or less collectively referred to by EHL as &quot;Puud&quot;.<br>
<br>
Raiding once sent me a tell during a Vindi pull insisting that I was Acturian and that I couldn't make him leave Kael if he didn't want to. I'd reply to him with something like &quot;I ain't him - leave me alone&quot;, which would be enough to generate two or three more paragraphs from him. He went on for about 10 minutes. Very surreal, almost like European cinema. <br>

I grouped with her a couple times in HK waaaaaaaay back when...she was the frickin' main tank, but she'd go afk for like 25-30 minutes at a stretch and just sit there and suck up exp. Well, after a coupla times of that happening, we all just booted her. <br>
<br>
She comes back after like an hour, is still standing in the warrior room with us....she's like &quot;What happened? Guys?&quot;<br>
<br>
lol<br>
<br>
If you're a big enough doorknob that you go AFK for that long, and you're the friggin' tank, EXPECT to get booted.<br>
<br>
Also Sirinab, though I never actually grouped with her but I was around for her antics in Thurgadin with the banker. Nice. Can anyone say &quot;Wheel of Karma&quot;? Smacked her in the arse, that one did. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I was having very VERY bad connection problems back then. I had gotten DSL then moved to a different location (apparently out of range, but the company never told me). My isp would go down for seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, even a month once.<br>
<br>
EQ was not an enjoyable experience very much back then at all, going LD at random times. Especially in the middle of fights or soloing.<br>
<br>
I remember that fight very well. We pulled the Ry`Gorr Chief and 2 elite guards came tagging along. The enchanter mezzed away and we started to pound away at the chief. We all agreed to run to CC when the chief died because we were getting beaten so badly.<br>
<br>
Once the chief died I waited a second and ran and checked the corpse, told the group a Spine Chill Spear dropped. I looted it, invised, and ran like mad to CC zone (which is what we had planned). As soon as I zone in, boom, LD.<br>
<br>
In this situation does it look bad? Yes. Did I know I was screwed because it looked like this? Yes. I came back when my ISP came back up (a few days later) and petitioned stating what had happened. I spoke with a GM and he said I had no warnings, petitions, or reports on me at all. <br>
<br>
I was soon hit by many tells saying what a Ninja Looter I was and such, I recognized one name from the group. I said I would be willing to get the group back together and roll on the spine chill spear, his response was &quot;I don't even want to see you again&quot;.<br>
<br>
What was I to do? I had an item that looked ninja looted in the eyes of many when few people knew I was innocent. I gave it away to some random person in gfay. I didn't want to deal with it anymore.<br>
<br>
Talasar, what I just told you is not a lie. I would never intentionally steal anything from anyone. I go out of my way to help people and always lend a hand when I can. You can ask a few of my friends from way back when if I really did go LD so much from my ISP. I have never been denied a rez, group, or anything else because of what you seem to be telling and no one responding.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe in karma, once again, I would NEVER ever steal from anyone. I offered you the money it goes for now but you refused, see me trying to make amends for a misfortune back then? <p><CENTER>

I grouped with him before he later joined Wraith. <br>
<br>
Was before I joined Vis also, so I think it was Jan/Feb of 2001.. <br>
<br>
anyway, i grouped with him when he was playing his dwarf cleric saying over and over how he hated all uber guilds. <br>
<br>
then like he quit the cleric, and later on it was Wilkon &lt;Wraith&gt; .. <br>
<br>
so i donno which Wilkion (god cant remember his cleric's name) that I was grouped with. <br>

And don't think about grouping with her.  You might as well have a warrior as the cleric, actually the warrior would do a better job.<br>

No offense, but I doubt many people let you would. They were doing a huge favor by helping you with the heals and things. You weren't contributing much of anything to helping kill the giants (if at all).<br>

What you're doing here is slapping the hand that was trying to help. If you bitched and moaned to them about it and I was one of them I would be putting your name here. <p><CENTER>

I'm heading to ToV for a raid. I get to SG and they are killing the walrus there are zone in. I sit down to camp across and the next thing I see is: A Bulthork hits you !  ok.. so maybe they needed to zone. I zone back out as well.  I heal us all up, turn back around and zone back in. Sitting to camp out again. A BULTHORK HITS YOU ! !  WTF???  I zone back out and Meechung says.. DIE EXPLOITER ! ! I'm like huh? do I know you?  She/he then goes on about how they are petitioning me for exploiting the zone and that I was going to get banned. I;m like whatever and try to camp out once more. here comes the bulthork. =(  Thank god for my kick ass guildies..  Solanie and Duralupal came to help. Killed the bulthork, /rude Meechung and Meechang and then succored me accross...<br>
<br>
These assholes should just DIE... someone get THEM banned.. PLZ <br>
