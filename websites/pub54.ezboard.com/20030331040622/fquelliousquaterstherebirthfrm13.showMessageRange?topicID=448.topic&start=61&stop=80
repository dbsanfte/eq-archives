From what I have heard, Kuud is a player that was banned from EQ a while ago.  His former character was named Backs Muhaha.  When banned, I believe Backs was a lv 54 Rogue who had basically screwed so many people, he was too well known to get a group.  He was notorious for trying to MQ a phantom Hate stone to Rangers, and the list of people he screwed out of their Ranger epics is long (and I was one of them).  I have heard from people that say they know him in real life, and that this is the same person.  I also know Kuud stole a bunch of items from a member of Circle of Sapientia.  He was supposed to be doing a transfer for the person, but just logged off with his stuff.<br>
<br>
From what I have read here, I would be willing to bet Xocin's right arm this is the same person.<br>

<br>
One night late in July of 2002 I'm camping the Hole ent. My healing partner had just logged, so I'm scaning /who xxx for a healer to join me when Kuud pops in. Deispite the bad things I had heard about him on Naggy raids, I invite him to partner with me and he joins.<br>
<br>
A few pulls later I end up having to zone at like 5% health cause he's not slowing, healing or responding to tells. Never said he was goin AFK or anything. While I'm binding wounds outside I'm sending him tells and getting no replies. Out of the blue he disbands.<br>
<br>
I zone back in thinking, ok maybe he went Link Dead, which might have explained the lack of healing, but it would have been a VERY long time going link dead. I pop up inside the Hole and find him still there, only now he's grouped 2 other ppl that must have logged in at the zone. I ask him what the hell happened, to which he replies &quot;Sory&quot;. Nothing more.<br>
<br>
I then ask him to invite me and he wont put me in the group.<br>
<br>
So basically what he did was steel my camp in an EXTREAMLY sleezy way, rather then share the XP with me.<br>
<br>
A few days later I'm huntiong the Hole zone again when folks start zoning in for a Kirn raid for Kuud. One of the folks on the raid was a guild mate who tells me the situation. Kuud is planning a Naggy raid for the next day and offering a +100 bonus to roll on loot for all that help him with Kirn. I warn my guild mate not to trust Kuud but he goes on the raid anyway.<br>
<br>
2 Days later my guild mate tells me:<br>
<br>
A) The Kirn raid failed, with almost everyone getting wiped.<br>
<br>
B) The next day my guild mate was not given the roll bonus on the Naggy raid and as a result lost a CoF to a cleric who did not attend the Kirn raid.<br>
<br>
On 9/2/02 I was in Seb when to my surprise Kuud got added to the group list. Not 10min into the group, Kuud goes AFK for like 20min saying something about &quot;kid throwing up all over the place&quot;. From what I've read in this thread, this player isn't even old enough to have kids.<br>
<br>
I really try not to hold grudges, but over a 2 month period, my experiences have shown this player to be manipulative, a liar, selfserving, and totaly unscrupulous. A significant amount of time would have to go by with no further problems befor I'd associate with him or any guild that woulod have him as a member.<br>
<br>
People do eventually deserve another chance, unfortunately Kuud's will be a long time coming. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ualband.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlbanD</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/3/02 8:19:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=66>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://militaryvets.homestead.com/files/saber.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kuud</span><hr size=1> I can relate to Kuud's spamming in tells, a couple of months ago while porting people and he was about 29 I think he sent me tells, about 1 every 5 mins asking to powerlevel him.  I told him I don't powerlevel people, well, not anyone I don't know.  So, a day or so later, I get a tell asking me again, over the space of about an hour with the same crap, asking to be powerleveled.  I remind him that I had just told him a day or so later that I don't powerlevel people, especially people I don't know and just ask out of the blue.  <br>
<br>
From the looks of it, he found someone willing to.  He's seemed to me on the couple of occassions I&quot;ve come across him that he's useless and I'm glad now that I didn't help him. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=158559">Alban DeSantis</a>

Yesterday I was duoing with a friend and a guildy told me she was on a Naggy raid and kuud just showed up. I knew hilarity would ensue, so I joined the channel. Here is what happened over the course of an hour from that channel. I only copied the good stuff, not the &quot;drag my corpse plz&quot; or all the &quot;You slash blahblah for 5 points of damage&quot;. I edited out the names of my guildies comments because Naggy was a public channel but my guildchat is not.<br>

It went down just like that.  That is when my guildmate told all of us to join naggy channel so we can get our entertainment for the day.  I was in ME at the time and I was almost killed I was laughing so hard.  Just for the record I was on a Naggy raid on Saturday that Kuud led.  It failed.<br>

I'm not gonna completely blame Kuud.  It wasn't all his fault, we almost had Naggy.  <br>
