I do not understand your posting here at all. <br>
I was the one who pulled the shissir and like 10 amys and two cubes and a TT at once. The shissir was agro free and i engaged and pulled. I spent 40 mins sending tells to twistadowhoever. I tried to resolve the situation as best I could and even talked to bip. Banelion then took up the task after twistadowhoever told me to fgk off. I was also told by Bip that well thats twistadowhoever for you. We were forced to roll for the Rage camp so we used that rule that was used on us. <br>
The pull was clean and I got shissir to camp solo and fained ....when twistadowhoever (forgive me I did not want to check the screen shot) trained the temple mobs on us. <br>
We got the kill and looted as needed. I will say that rules that are used for a case sometimes can be used against you in others. After the swc was clear of amys I ressed the cleric and began cr again and was trained by Tristadorn. We were able to camp as I trained the mobs back. Liuim from VM was there helping us and was killed by Trists train. I do not understand how peeps think training a monk can do anything. I guess thats their own idea.<br>
 <br>
We will follow the rules that have been placed on us. Its just that simple if rolling is what you want ,rolling is what you get.<br>
 <br>
I hope that gets pasted in like 10 posts I dont care. There I even spaced it out for you. <br>
<br>
Know my words and know them to be true and with the power of which I speak. We will be fair and play by the lame rules that are in place.<br>
But dont call me friend and post behind my back !!!!<br>

I mean thats not for us. thats not for radiant.  The whole quellious community wants to know?  Thats why your here isnt it? Its not in your post.<br>
<br>
Radiant was in the zone first you guys have admited that.<br>
Radiant cleared the temple first you guys have admited that.<br>
Now what you keep glancing over as officers is whether or not your disputing that bippity agrod first.  <br>
<br>
You clearly have an interest in clearing this up.  i know were not talking to each other.  And that would do the most to clear it up.  QC will thank you for answering those questions verbo, officer of ADD.<br>

<br>
Let another Guild clear to a mob, then follow them and make them roll for a spawn? I don't think so!<br>
<br>
Zones like Fear inwhich a guild MUST CLEAR to get to a mob, then it's theirs until they FAIL at the mob. <br>
<br>
If a guild wants the AoW, they get it by killing Vindi, Statue, Idol. If you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  EXPECT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a guild to then ROLL on who gets the AoW, your out of your mind. Theres a difference between the Ragefire camp and the Plane of Fear. The ragefire camp is camped usually by a lone cleric without the necessary force to kill ragefire. In those instances when ragefire does pop, the group who gets there with sufficient force gets the mob. If two or more guilds get there with sufficient force at about the same time, then a GM can force a roll.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  HOWEVER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the Wraith in PoF is different. Radiant apparently had &quot;SUFFICIENT FORCE&quot; present before ADD zoned in, cleared to the mob. Whether or not they aggroed the Wraith at this point is pointless. They were there first, they did the clearing, and by <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  ALL RIGHTS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have first shot at the Wraith. What ADD did in my eyes is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  WRONG</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;Guild Rules And Conduct<br>
The following rules have been established to make our playing time more enjoyable and not as a means to take away from an individual&amp;#146;s total gaming experience. <br>
<br>
1) Conduct and Character Issues: <br>
<br>
With regard to conduct and attitudes, we encourage people to have fun, laugh and enjoy each other&amp;#146;s company. Do not participate in offensive behavior that may be degrading to other members or even yourself. Please try to police your own actions or they may be reviewed for guild disciplinary actions by our officers. <br>
<br>
Some of the more serious offenses are kill stealing, deliberate deception and any attempt to defraud guild members as well as other players. Our guild members should adhere to the General Guidelines as indicated by Verant. Lying, undermining other members, begging or leaving your wiped out group without offering to help are examples of conduct we wish not have associated with At Deaths Door. When in doubt about a conduct issue, contact a guild officer for advice - &quot;Ignorance&quot; is not a viable excuse. <br>
<br>
Its every guild members duty to act as a guild custodian and police not only your own, but others actions of guild members. Please be discreet when handling these situations and not openly berate members in an open guild chat forum unless no other recourse is available. <br>
<br>
Use common sense when dealing with problems with guildmates and others. Try to solve any problems that you may encounter on your own at first. If you cannot, then please get an officer involved before making snap decisions. Disbanding from the guild &amp;#147;in the heat of the moment&amp;#148; is frowned upon and likely you will not get a re-invite. Disbanding from the guild will result in the loss of all GPK points. <br>
<br>
At Death&amp;#146;s Door does not condone a player having characters in a variety of guilds and require that all characters are associated with this guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
******<br>
<br>
I too feel sorry that this happened, for Maeve and also for my former guildmates who joined ADD and are now caught in the middle. I have had only one issue with one member of ADD personally, and to me, it did not reflect on the guild. To me, the character and reputation of Radiant and those members I value highly, and for them to blast ADD for wrongdoing says something to me...<br>
<br>
it happened...<br>
<br>
I had heard about the Rage thing the other morning, as I logged on just after Rage went down at 5am. I was surprised there wasn't a flame about it, since Rage is a favorite topic of conversation on the boards. But I know there wasn't one... Radiant has class, and respect for others. For there to be an all out explosion towards ADD and Maeve actually flaming (nice one by the way), there is a reason. <br>
<br>
I am unsure why the cleric in ADD has had such trouble with getting Rage. If it's true that he is left to camp there for days on end alone, that is most likely the reason. Camping Ragefire requires support from the whole guild, and if ADD, with their numbers and strength would put even half of their guild to camp with him, he would get it in no time. <br>
<br>
I am sad to see such things going on, and it's too bad with all the zones in Norrath and on the moon, there are still issues with people taking advantage of someone else's hard work, instead of going elsewhere to make their own successes.<br>
<br>
(edit<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ah, some characters wigged out on pasting over, sorry for the mangling of the rules) <p><BR>

I must say.. your BS about we only use those rules that are forced on us is almost as big of a laugh as your cheap Matrix-wannabe name.<br>

<br>
I didn't attack you - I said you're learning well what the ADD leadership wants to teach you.  If you think there is something amiss in that statement, let me know where I was wrong.<br>
<br>
Your fault (and in truth that of your mates) was in engaing the mob in the first place.  If you won't let your leadership lead you into these situations, then you won't find yourself in them.  When you found another guild in Fear puling to the Shissar, you should have either offered youe help or went on your way.<br>
<br>
When ADD didn't do that - something like this is almost a foregone conclusion.  As to the ACTUAL aggro state - well, if one assumes the log's from Bippity to be accurate, then the druid had aggro and you came and took it from her.  Perhaps, because of lag from all the mobs moving around and the high population in Fear, the mob didn't appear to be moving when you whacked it to get aggro.   The point remains - you should not have been there to whack it.<br>
<br>
There are rules provided by Verant to guide folks in this situation.  They are the &quot;law&quot; in our case, and like laws, we seem to need lawyers to interpret them.<br>
<br>
To make a stark example - if a person shoots someone in the head in a public place, gets arrested and then tried, and then is acquitted because the police didn't dot every I and cross every T,   is he any less guilty of murder?<br>
<br>
You walked up and robbed Maeve.  Whether you get off remains to be seen.<br>
<br>
btw - my friendship is not blind - when someone I'm associated with begins to go down the &quot;wrong&quot; path, I'll try to pull them back.  If they persist, well, that's their path and not mine.<br>
<br>
From just under a year ago, in a post to Garaddor on your boards (dont bother to go look for it, Firius wiped it long ago)<br>
<br>
-------<br>
However, my continued presence here in your public forum is due somewhat<br>
to my sense of civic duty to those who remain in ADD (or those who<br>
joined after I left). It is akin to the responsibility one might have to<br>
direct folks around a broken bridge or away from a hazardous area. That<br>
I was never guild-bonded with somone doesn't diminish that duty. While you<br>
(obviously) do not see any need for me to perform such a service, be<br>
assured I'm not directing this information to you. <br>

Say it then if your going to say it.  Trist, Maeve, Bippity all the names people new here were lieing to QC.  You think QC is going to respect ADD more if they hop around it.  I mean you all talked with huge badwords cept it took you 5 pages to get around to it:<br>
ADD pulled the temple its what Verbo is saying and your backing up.<br>
<br>
So that stuff about it might have been that he didnt know bippity agrod it was all useless banter.  Trist, Maeve, Eadric, Bippity were lying from the outset about having pull the temple?  I mean Verbo was there maybe he can clarify it.  You walked into a full spawn at the temple verbo?<br>
