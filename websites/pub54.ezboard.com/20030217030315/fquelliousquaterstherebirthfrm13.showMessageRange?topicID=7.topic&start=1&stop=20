It was no big secret that we were going.  We had been planning it for a while.  Things were quiet when we got there.  We picked a few places, broke up the spawns, and set up camps.  So far, so good....  Then Wraith showed up and proceeded to take over our camps.  They let us have a few kills and take some of the stuff that they didn't need.  They even told us that we should be happy because they were protecting spawns from FFAers and giving us their leftovers.  Rather than call in some big guns and fight over mobs with them, we left.  We tried again later and similar thing happened.<br>
<br>
While I doubt that the reservation system will ever be reinstated or if it would work if it was, the current system (if there even is one) sure the hell doesn't work.  50+ characters should not have to leave and join uber guilds or beg for scraps from them in order to hunt in the planes once and a while.  Perhaps if someone kept a calendar and guilds communicated with one another more and tried to share planes with each other, more people would get what they want and we would all be much happier.  Even a FCFS system would be better than allowing biggest bully on the block to take over everything.  Take a look around sometime, uber guilds... you aren't the only ones in Quellious.  The person who just SoWed, healed, buffed, ported, rezzed, or guided you (often at no charge) may just be from a guild like mine and we have every right to be there and have some of the same opportunities as you all do.<br>

I DO know some friends I have in HU have contacted me and asked me &quot;wtf man?&quot; And I'll tell you what I've told them:<br>
<br>
Wraith has more or less gone FFA, as has the rest of the server, whether they wanted to or not. Remember the &quot;reservation system&quot;? where is it now. GONE. Nothing is left, because of ASSHOLES, both guilded, and nonguilded. Know why Pantera etc took down the board? because of in-game AND out-game harassment! Can you imagine someone threatening to kick your ass over a spawn? I don't blame him. They've tried their damndest to stay afloat among this mess, but getting refused to groups cause of being a moderator? Hell, I even got a wierd IM one day from a &quot;KefkahKaos&quot; on AOL. He stated my full name and said hello. I don't know if it was the real one or not, but regardless, it was an odd feeling, when none of my friends would fess up. I don't really want someone pulling stunts like that on me either! I'm a moderater here, but if you screw with me, I'll quietly tell the other moderators I'm deleting yer posts and banning you. If that doesn't stop the posts, I'll ban IP/domain. And if that doesn't stop ya, I'll just report the traffic as harassment to your respective authorites.<br>
<br>
Yes there's hostility now. Is it my fault? Wraith's fault? Vis's fault? DB's fault? Goin downhill now, departures come every day of people quitting. More will follow. about 35% of the best players of Quellious are gone. By best, I mean the honest, fun, PLAYERS. Not the ones who've made EQ their life. Honestly, I hope Verant pulls the plug, and makes somepeople go back hardcore to RL. I'd like to see a 2 month downtime, JUST to see who comes back, who doesn't care, and who commits suicide cause EQ is out of their lives for a few months. Did you know that really might happen? Stop getting pissed cause of this crap.<br>
<br>
Get in groups, go fletch arrows for tanks, go port newbies to Toxx, go megabuff crocs in Oasis, SURELY you can find something to do. I've invited someone who's nonguilded on EVERY raid i've been in! I take my FRIENDS. If I remember you being a jerk, you're not goin. I have yet to be kicked out of a group cause of my guild, and I think it's mostly cause I'm known for being me. I always answer EVERY tell. I never refuse 1 person, cause of exp. (well, except for 1 time... hehe sorry Docc!)<br>
<br>
What choice is left but FFA now? Feel free to tell me. I do NOT like FFA. It makes my guildmates get pissed when I can't be around for kills that are going on NOW cause I have work etc. I'd rather know a week or so in advance, &quot;Trak on Thursday&quot; than log on and get &quot;oshit, someone go get raalf, port him in, we got under 20 min before VM breaks past the reets!&quot;<br>

<br>
In fact I and a couple others went in to grab a couple spawns...see what was up. <br>
When we got there a member of Nomad Souls was very polite in informing us they had a raid going at the moment. <br>
<br>
She even offered for some of us to stay and raid with them.<br>
<br>
Wraith was rude in doing what they did, the raiders that were there all day and the day before (were using the old 3 day system) put in alot of work to get where they were.<br>
<br>
I think respect has a place in FFA. <br>

Whining bitching and moaning about loot and plaes cost us QQ and the reservation system. Its sucks llama balls but its true. Now we're FFA and the sad truth is small guilds wont kill a god for a LONG LONG LONG LONG time. But you know what?.... Big @#%$ deal. There's a whole bunch of other shiot to kill. There's a zone CHOK FULL o Dragons there's cobaltscar there's Growth there's EJ there's KC and when your bored there's Unrest (come on really how many of you want some SERIOUS revenge on unrest baddies?)<br>

Tamas might be a raging gerbil monkey but he's right you dont know what you got till its gone. Guess what else tho.. you wont know what you can get if you dont move on.<br>
<br>
You dont need epic weapons you dont need to be uber moober or a goober. All you need is a few friends some baddies to kick square in the NUUUUTS and some beer. gots to have the beer.<br>

We went in, plane was empty of players and started to pull some stuff. Denia logs in and explains how they used to have it reserved on the now none existant reserve system. An agreement is reached, we're just interested in epic drops. I dunno what was said in tells, but I didnt see any bullying.<br>
<br>
Well anyways, I've come to the conclusion that there is no reservations system anymore. We can go to PoF and pull mobs whenever we like, just like we do in PoG as can you and anyone else. Never heard anyone complain in PoG, even tho we had other guilds there pulling at same time as us. Sometimes our competition in PoG beat us to a spawn sometime we beat them, big deal wait for next pop and try again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uishanserrasbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ishan Serrasbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>All Your Base Are Belong To Us</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(3/6/01 11:24:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://fp.geocities.com/gorfain_family/bait.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bullied out of Fear</span><hr size=1> yeah! suck it down, whiners <p><center><img src="http://fp.geocities.com/gorfain_family/ishanbanner.gif" </center>

<br>
Right, FFA is in effect but that doesnt rule out being cooperative and respecting someone elses raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
For smaller guilds its harder to organize a large group to jump into Fear and raid, why not let them have a couple days that they had planned and put off your raid? <br>
<br>
Its just a game...play a different day.<br>
No harm in that except *gasps* you will have to wait!<br>

That's all. Sure we worked our way towards CT by killing mobs but all drops off the regular mobs were defaulted to the other Guild(s) there. I have zero verm armor and I've been around a long time. Druid tunic and legs dropped off the Gorgons. Think I took it or rolled? Nope. We were there just for epic stuff. Bullied? I don't think so.<br>

It doesn't take a 20-30+ ppl raid. Get a good balanced group, invis up and go to the usual camp spot. Mobs in fear is not harder than mobs in Seb atm. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufemwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Femwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif  BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(3/11/01 7:39:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bullied out of Fear</span><hr size=1> I know it may sound silly to some. <br>

Especially those that got the game and were powered to the lvl they are by friends or guild.<br>
<br>
But I remember my first time getting to go to the planes. <br>
<br>
The planes are more than just loot and epic pieces.<br>
