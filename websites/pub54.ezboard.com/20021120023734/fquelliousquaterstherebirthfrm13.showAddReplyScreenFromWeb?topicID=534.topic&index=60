We got Raehn saying that Cazel was up and UP Enc engaged.  OK so /who all unruled.  Two with roleplay on, one in Sro, and teh rest in teh far reaches of the world that are non port zones such as Chardok and Maidens.  We decide to mobilize and if UP comes they come.  I do a /who all unruled approx 20 min later and I notice that every UP person is in the same zone as they were 20 minutes ago even the one in Sro.  Right or wrong I can at least honestly say they didnt move real fast.  <br>
<br>
As far as an Enc and lower level Paladin soloing Cazel it wont happen.  Necros far better then myself have tried it and havent been able to do it and a high level Necro is more powerful then a lower level paladin and a 60 Ench in this zone since necros dots and pet is more DPS then they were supplying.   I honestly feel they would not have been successful if they had continued.<br>
<br>
We probably should have allowed her to die before engaging but after doing a /who all unruled numerous times it was obvious IMO that they were not moving to assist.  I realize that some could have been /anon or on twinks.  Kiting till forces arrive is a method of holding a mob but how long do you allow a kite when you have sufficient force when it is obvious from my point of view that no more UP were on the way.<br>
<br>
I realize Radiant has a bad rep at times but from the people I have met in this guild not one person ever has done something to blatantly piss people off if it hasnt been done to us by them many times over.  As for Hate I know we moved slow to Safe Camp to avoid aggro and after seeing Quechan pull Hate 3 times now I am pretty comfortable saying she didnt bring a train of 20 mobs.  From my viewpoint we were in teh middle of fighting a few mobs when all of a sudden all hell broke lose.  With as many mobs as we had in camp I highly doubt Quechan was out pulling plus all members had been in safe camp long enough to not have generated aggro from running there.  I am not sure if Quechan stood up to help in teh fight and somehow some aggro was still attached which might have happened.  The only other thing I can see was UP brought some chain aggro onto us and dumped it there.  I was AFk for the 2nd floor incident so wont comment on it since I prefer to not speak about things I wasnt privy too. <br>
<br>
The Cazel incident was unfortunate and I apoligize for the hard feelings.  Unfortunatly the high end game is a huge damn race and he who is fastest normally wins.  I dont think it is right nor do I like it but it is teh way things work.  I dont know what to say about Cazel as I would probably be mad about someone taking a mob from me but if I cant kill it then why even attempt to try?  Epics suck and force people to race for spawns and the person who normally loses is pissed.  I dont harbor bad feelings against UP as I havent had any dealings with them that I can honestly say without a doubt that they wronged me as speculation is an ugly thing.  What we did at Cazel was based around the fact that UP wasnt mobilizing and yes Trist was checking to see if they were moving as far as I know.  All that I have stated are from my point of view and may or may not be true.<br>

Raehn is one of the sweetest persons to play eq and she does not want to cause discord or mistrust at this level.  Though I can't speak for her, expect her to mq the spoon back to Amaya.  I think the Cazel incident came about as what happened in hate, though I don't necessarily agree with the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; attitude, it is over, Raehn will rectify the situation.  Please do not flame Radiant for misdoings that are pure speculation.  All in all, Radiant is a good guild with good people.  It is unfortunate that we have been caught up in a flame like this where much is formulated on baseless accusations saying we are as bad ADD was etc.  Do to the deleterious side affects of flame posts against guilds, many guild reputations have suffered from it, even though that guild may have been a good guild, the flames against it were able twist lies and truths into a bunch of half truths.  Everyone is entitled to opinions but get the facts please before making that opinion.  Up to this point it has been all conjectures without any supporting evidence.<br>
