<br>
Freedom is different for each and every person.  The fact that I can drink coffee on a daily basis may be my freedom, while your ability to smoke a joint in public may be yours (european folks).  Each and every one of us hold our own price for freedom.<br>
<br>
I have been in the military.  I have seen some shit that 90% of the american public would puke over.  Maybe that was MY price for my freedom, maybe not.<br>
<br>
Each and every person is responsible for your own freedom within the laws of each respective country, and when you and the majority of the population do not take your freedom seriously, as in most cases, someone else will take your freedom seriously, for you.  <br>
<br>
Also, bear in mind, that 78% of our laws are well over 200 year old.  Times change, as does the need for laws to change.<br>
<br>
I'll not post on this thread again, as this is VERY much a passionate subject for me.   And I would not be able to refrain from a full derailing of the original post.<br>

Oh, and Esm said &quot;yet just this summer the President thought India and Pakistan were not sovereign enough to declare war on one another over the matter of Kashmir and urged them to handle it peacefully. But we'll be damned if we listen to other countries!&quot;. Hmm, this could maybe just possibly be because they're both nuclear powers and, hold your breath, not terribly stable. Pakistan has seen the military overthrow civilian control how many times? India has seen localised uprisings utterly shred governmental control how many times? Small military coups occur in both with a frightening regularity. They are both more than a touch lax on security, and not great at controlling the violence lurking below the surface towards the hated foe across the artificially created border.<br>
<br>
I'd be urging the nation-state level equivalent of a drunken brawler with poor impulse control to put down the nukes too. <p>a_Bearhat01<br>

Regarding India, are you referring to the outdated caste system trying to coincide with a democracy? Other than that, I expect *somebody* to tell them to cool it.

Among other problems. <br>
<br>
India, and specifically Hindu philosophy, religion, and culture is an area of great interest for me. I have a deep and abiding respect for the beauty of the culture, literature, art, and thought, but, boy howdy, their politics are a clusterfuck, and the staggering number of incidences per year when a random mob springs up and goes collectively wacky is terrifying.<br>
<br>
Watching the caste system (and many other entrenched anachronisms) collide violently with the modern world is one of the more enjoyable spectator sports in world news, IMO =)<br>
<br>
&quot;Other than that, I expect *somebody* to tell them to cool it. I was trying to say that the US is very good at handing out advice, but it turns a deaf ear when it wants to.&quot;<br>
<br>
I see what you are saying, to an extent, but there is a time when the same advice may be prudent for one party, and inane for another. While I may advocate Safe Sex for the masses, my wife and I don't sweat it in our strictly monogamous relationship. In this case, it is damned prudent for the USA (and everyone else on the planet) to get India and Pakistan to back off, and to do so with a quickness. The ones who are asking the US to back of from Iraq aren't doing so for similar reasons.<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, USA, think of stability in the region&quot; is so much weaker than &quot;THEY HAVE NUKES, YOU MORONS!&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, before we get too deeply into this, I have been seen to be a fairly Conservative guy on these boards, and I generally support Bush and generally like what he is doing. However, I dislike the proposed war with Iraq, part deux, and I utterly despise and deride the Patriot Act. Ashcroft is a man of conviction, and I like seeing a bulldog like him in that office snapping at the end of his leash and trying to get teeth into all that he can. I just wonder why the hand holding the leash hasn't called him to heel yet. <br>
<br>
Just wanted to be clear as to where I stand in this. While I think a couple of the Liberals prattling on earlier are silly in extremo, I am not waving the Bush flag and turning a blind eye on what I feel are a more frightening erosion of personal liberties than I would've ever expected under a Republican government. <br>

<br>
If you wonder why I say that, examine the gleeful erosion of the 2nd amendmant under Clinton. <br>
<br>
Were this a Dem administration, there would be an entirely different spin put on the Patriot Act by our &quot;unbiased&quot; mass media. It would be portrayed as a non-intrusive measure that was necessary and would help in the battle to end terrorism. As it is, with Ashcroft behind it, we are seeing it as the Fascisti's latest attempt to spy on you and me.<br>
<br>
Not that this isn't, at its' core, true, but more that we would see it presented in a far different light were the shoe on the other foot.<br>
<br>
Additionally, were there a Dem in the Big Office, we would see less of a hubbub about the proposed war. Hell, Clinton bombed the shinola out of Iraq during the Lewinski Explosion, and no one in Big Media particularly called him on it or protested it so mightily. Where was the furor over Bosnia? <p>a_Bearhat01<br>

And...why exactly should Americans pay with their freedoms because a terrorist succeeded where intelligence failed, Mr. Ashcroft? <br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
i was in navy for 8 years,  4 years spent on a ballistic missle nuclear submarine pointing 24 long range missles at the as$holes that deserved a nuke pointing at them. my marriage failed, as did many within my command, but my daughter can grow up in a free nation, with the right to believe, say, and be anything she chooses, limited only by her own ambition. that is the price of freedom, personal and close to home.<br>
<br>
americans lose more and more freedoms every day because we are becoming so dumbed down and not able to think for ourselves that most wont even realize their freedom is gone till its too late.<br>
<br>
1. lawsuits against mcdonalds for a lady spilling her own coffee in her lap. she would have brought it back if it was cold and wanted her money back... <br>
2. 2 runaways suing  mcdonalds because they are overweight... <br>
3. a 13 year old boy knocks up his teacher and she goes to jail... dont know about you, but if i got laid at age 13, by an adult/teacher... id of been bragging like hell to my friends... you cant rape the willing. teacher should have lost job and banned from teaching juveniles, not jailed for 10 years.<br>
4. the average american high school student cant read 150 words a minute, gets a D in algebra, and cant spell engineering, let alone hope to ever be one.<br>
5. courts try to pass legislation banning &quot;one nation under god&quot;  in public schools pledge of allegiance (im atheist, and i still find this disturbing... one nation under god, in god we trust, swearing on the bible in court, congress opens every session with prayer, freedom of speech and religion). <br>
<br>
wake up, your losing rights as you live each day, and its not because terrorists are up to no good... its because we let special interest groups take a little more each time, because we dont throw a bullsh*t flag at courts enacting legislation (remember checks and balances? they arent allowed to make laws, only declare existing laws legal or not... but a court in california passed its own law that banned soda from school cafeterias because in the judges opinion kids are too fat). <br>
<br>
ok, /rant off... gone on, i could type all day. <br>
<br>
enjoy your opinions, they define you. and dont forget that being an american is why you can state your opinions here without fear of repurcussion, except from other opinionated indivduals who also have the right to counter your beliefs with there's.<br>

An awful lot of what is wrong with this country deals with torts. Our tort system is nothing short of caustically insane. It's poisonously unhealthy. <br>
<br>
Working in the insurance industry, I deal with lawyers on a daily basis. They aren't really all scum like people make out, but they do survive and prosper in what can only be seen as an inherently flawed and dishonest system.<br>
<br>
We desperately need tort reform.<br>
<br>
More than vote reform, campaign finance reform, tax code reform, or any other reform that doesn't threaten to actively kill us dead if we don't reform it, we need tort reform.<br>
<br>
And we'll NEVER get it.<br>
<br>
Why? Look at the backgrounds of our lawmakers. See how many of them are lawyers? It's a stultifying percentage. Look at the backgrounds of most of the effective lobbyists. An ugly nuber of them are lawyers too. Look at what associations and organisations our lawmakers and lobbyists are part of, who they're money comes from, who their friends are. Our legislative branch is so damned beholden to the lawyers in this country that we might as well say that the lawyers do run the nation.<br>
<br>
And where do lawyers make their money? The real money? The big bucks? <br>
<br>
From torts.<br>
<br>
When that lawyer gets his client awarded a $30000 settlement for stubbing his toe in a car accident, the lawyer walks away with ~$10k of it on average. When that judge loses his mind and awards some utter tard $15mil because she spilled coffee in her own lap, that lawyer gets his third of it.<br>
<br>
So, who wants to lay odds that we'll ever see tort reform when our lawmakers made their money from torts, when their friends make their money from torts, and when the lobbyists for the various Bar assoc etc are paid by people who make their money off torts.<br>
<br>
Tort reform is what we need, and tort reform we'll never get. <p>a_Bearhat01<br>

<br>
A tort is an act that constitutes a breach of contract or agreement or causes harm to another party that may make the individual/group who commits the tort subject to liability for injury and/or damages.  A tort may or may not be expressly illegal but still subjects the person accused of committing it to the possibility of a lawsuit.  They're defined and punished by state law or state interpretation as opposed to federal law or in some cases, common sense.<br>
<br>
The aforementioned case of the woman suing McDonalds for making the coffee too hot is a tort.  There's no actual legislation regulating coffee temperature but the argument is that McDonald's was negilgent about their patrons' safety by not displaying a warning about their coffee being hot.  Common sense would dictate that the woman should have known the coffee was hot (And had the case been tried in another state, that may well have been the verdict.) But in the state where the case was heard, guilt/innocence of a tort violation is determined by whether or not the party was injured and the accused was/was not responsible for the act.<br>

The US is the new global enemy, and you will see the back lash soon. Its hard to see it from inside so I don’t blame you, but turn off Cnn and MSNBC and you might learn something.<br>

Still have yet to see how iraq has been linked to terroism.. sure iraq is a rouge nation, but the us will be soon if they attack a sovreign nation with zero proof. <br>
