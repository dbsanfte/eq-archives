It's called common courtesy, both of which your guilds lack. It's why laws have to be instated in the first place. Ever hear about the &quot;front porch rule&quot;? When anyone sets foot on your front porch, they're family. I may be Southern, but I'm a hell of a lot more likely to be someone's friend than enemy. I can't say the same for all involved in this thread.<br>
<br>
COMMON COURTESY....<br>
That's what this &quot;list&quot; is about. If you think it's foolish, cumbersome, whatever, fine. Don't follow. But when you jump an entire guild, it WILL come back to you some day. And I hope it does in force. <p><CENTER><IMG SRC=http://home.earthlink.net/~cromin/_uimages/Raalf.gif> <BR>

The &quot;list&quot; is all about clerics in-game, in Skyfire.  If folks want on the &quot;list&quot;, log on and head to SF.  Talk to the clerics there, get to know them, and pull up a seat and keep em company.<br>
<br>

Heck, it doesnt even have anything to do with me.  I'm just a foo who thinks it's a great idea... but at the end of the day, my opinion means nothing.<br>
<br>
Ooops... almost forgot... as posted earlier, if anyone camping Rage needs help when he pops, shoot me or anyone in Lor Mani a tell.  We'll help, and can usually have a full mobilization within 10 minutes.<br>

As far as the nay-sayers and negative people go, ignore em.  Stick to your guns, and to your beliefs.  The high road isnt easy, but it's worth it in the end.<br>

When I first went out to the &quot;camp,&quot; Fadomil was there and had the &quot;list&quot; of people.  He explained that they had only been jotting down the names of clerics who actually came out and talked to the ones currently there.  I don't think anyone is naive enough to think that the &quot;list&quot; is anything other than an effort to bring some order and civility to a long and often tedious camp.   Bennea actually started &quot;camping&quot; out there when Sassami's turn came -- and it was great having some company.  When he popped for her, I called some LC people, she had people from her guild, as well as some others who had helped earlier, and it went well.  Gruffnoy was next, and it was much the same.  We had exchanged phone numbers so people could take turns sleeping, watching -- whatever.  Anyway, as soon as I called him, his guild, some LC, some ADD, and several others helped out and, again, all went well.<br>
<br>
Bennea is currently waiting, and the list I inherited is as follows:  Bennea; Doclotus; LC cleric; Syllie; Breakdown/Mysses; Fenanan; Feadorn; Batto/Binary; Gwendry.  It's probably safe to assume that some might not be able to take their &quot;turn&quot; and some will be bumped up.  Still, having the names does allow people to plan a bit and get to know and cooperate with people from other guilds.  I would have posted sooner, but didn't know this thread was here, and, as I said, this was really only something I inherited.  I do know people on other servers are doing similar things.  Of course people can choose not to respect it, but I think most of us would rather cooperate and help each other in what has turned out to be a bit of a chore. <br>

It's funny... Raalf, a few DosG folks talk about others having no respect for people and not being able to play nice, while telling me directly &quot;do what I say when I say you can or I'll hate you&quot;.  As is other people in this thread treating thier list as an excuse to monopolize a spawn.  <br>
<br>
Hopefully if a cleric does show up in skyfire for Ragefire, they'll get in contact with someone like Binedina who will treat them with a little respect, and not some self-righteous prick that will try and strongarm and bully them into a system they may not have heard of before zoning in.  Respect works both ways, remember that.  <br>

<br>
Seems pretty simple to me. The ones talking about the sufficient force engagement rules are the ones who'd rush there with exactly the intent of petitioning a GM and invoking that sufficient force rule to kill Ragefire and spare themselves the long camp. If you really don't think it's right, stay the hell away, don't spout the rule and say &quot;well, it's not right, but that's how it is.&quot; It's only how it is because that's how you want to play it. It's not like a Ragefire spawn has a rule that requires immediate mobilization to Skyfire, now does it? You don't have to go there. The only reason that sufficient force rule gets invoked is because selfish guilds rush there and demand that rule be enforced. No GM is going to say &quot;Oh, this guild has more people in the zone, so the spawn is theirs&quot; without being called in. I'm sick of so-called uberguilds petitioning GMs and using the rules to justify their &quot;might makes right&quot; actions when they know what they're doing is wrong. It wouldn't be an incident if these guilds didn't feel compelled to run there and make an issue of it. <br>
<br>
These clerics have come up with a system that works, and members of some of the big guilds only seem to want to discuss how they'd use The Rules to undermine the system. I for one have endured the Ragefire camp under this method, and would support and help anyone abiding by it.<br>
<br>
With the abundance of high end equipment, skills and spells that add mana and mana regen, not to mention existing cleric epics already had in these guilds, I wouldn't think another cleric epic is a big enough deal for the so-called uberguilds anymore to be worth causing such trouble. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=137994">Byttorr Ebonknight</A>      /      <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=138042">Tamas Sturmpanzer</A><BR>

<br>
<br>
Does nobody see the inherent logical flaw here?   How is this different than Vis saying &quot;check with us if you want to try to have a shot at Trakanon&quot; 2 years ago?  Only difference I see is, Vis were going by the rules of the game, instead of making rules of their own they expected to supercede them.<br>
<br>
Nobody has done anything, currently Lotus Cult and Wraith have clerics willingly using your system.  My concern is many of you guys are trying to treat yourselves as authority.  <br>
<br>
What if a cleric outside of your system  sits in skyfire for 6 days after your crew kills a ragefire and intends to claim the next spawn?  If they simply don't want to get to the end of the line because they are able and willing to make the camp themselves?  Is it going to be a flameboard-fest and gm drama?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugemlin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gemlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/31/02 2:39:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Waiting List?</span><hr size=1> You know I'm getting sick and tired of these people attacking someone just because they are in one of the top guilds of a server.<br>
<br>
Name ONE Ragefire spawn that Vis Maior has come in and taken? NAME ONE. You can't, Our clerics for the majority have their epics and do NOT go to skyfire.<br>
<br>
Next How are we inconsiderate? We make deals with other guilds on the server for spawns. If you don't believe me, ask Lotus Cult. They'll be the first to tell you we work out deals with them.<br>
<br>
My posts on this thread was to point out that no matter what the list a few clerics make on this, it will not help. Simple of a fact that most the people on Quellious <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> DO NOT EVEN READ THIS FORUM</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and therefore will invoke the Play Nice Policy rules with GMs when it comes to a contested spawn. I am/was trying to point out a list will NOT work on Everquest due to the nature of people. And Yes a GM <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> WILL</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> award a spawn to anyone who is there FIRST with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> SUFFICIENT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> force. If you don't believe me, again Ask Lotus Cult, Wraith, Rel In Por, etc. <br>
<br>
Attacking me on this is in poor taste. I'm not even a cleric, but a individual that can see a MAJOR flaw in trying to get a list going here. There will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ALWAYS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be jerks on a server and theres nothing you can do about it. The way Verant has set up the Play Nice Policy on a Blue server severly benifits trolls/jerks/slimeballs/etc..<br>
<br>
The REASON why verant says &quot;SUFFICIENT FORCE&quot; is to stop guilds from sending one person to every spawn that that guild wants to hit and claim it camped. <br>
<br>
Is there a solution to Ragefire problems? In my opinion Yes.<br>
<br>
Simple put the Ragefire spawn on like the 4th or 5th island in the plane of air and make him a 24 hour spawn. In this way you will HAVE to have sufficient force to get to him, You will not get a contested spawn battle going (because yes, it takes keys to get to that island and it will be CLEAR on who should get him first). A side benifit would be that this zone would actually be used again. <br>
<br>
Other than something like I meantioned, the ONLY solution now is to have 12-16 of your friends camp ragefire with you. This will insure if he pops that you will get ragefire awarded to you.<br>

A couple important things seem to have been missed by the naysayers. One was already pointed out. It is a way of handling the spawn IN game between clerics IN game. I too hope this list never hits the boards as something official. What we have here is NOT a cut and dried system, but a fellowship of clerics, their guilds and friends, all lending support to each other to accomplish a common goal. This started out simply when a cleric who wished to camp Ragefire after another cleric was done helped camp Rage, lent support simply for the first to call camp.<br>
<br>
This leads me to a second issue. In the case of a cleric not in &quot;the system&quot; camping Rage at the same time as someone on the &quot;list&quot;. Generally camp is announced every so often, so I would hope that this cleric who was interested in camping Ragefire would object, say &quot;umm, I am too&quot; and go work things out one way or the other. I am not going to spend a lot of time on this issue because most of the objections to the way its being handled and the inherent problems/issues aren't even clerics. <br>
<br>
This whole &quot;system&quot; is not anything formal. The &quot;list&quot; is exactly what was said, indicated interest (further proved by spending time out there as well). The reason this will work is because guild lines are not defined for this purpose necessarily. It is based on honor, respect and the willingness to help others. There is no alliance of guilds controlling this whole thing, contrary to what some of you may seem to think you know. <br>
<br>
Have we had a single spawn issue since this has been done? No, I don't think so. Why? Because folks are banding together for the greater good. Clerics and their friends are putting in the time. Gone are the days when a guild would sit their cleric alone in Skyfire to sit and wait for the human version to spawn and then have to rush into the zone, hopefully before somone else gets word. There are constantly people there, as well as extensive resources to forces that can be brought in quickly. <br>
<br>
Lastly, I am addressing the KS issue. Yes, it is possible for some unethical guild to come in with sufficient force and take the spawn away from the camping cleric. But with the number of people who are working to help that cleric, the call to arms can go out pretty quick to multiple guilds at once, so it would be a very impressive feat for the scumbags to accomplish.<br>
<br>
To those who are bringing in mention of the bad and nasty uber guilds. Please don't complicate this issue with that trash. There have been people from most of the guilds who have gotten a bad rap on these boards helping out. LC, ADD, Wraith, etc. What guild you are in as not as important as your willingness to support the clerics of our server. Again I ask people to head out there for a week, spend time and see for yourself how it is going. Send the cleric a tell of support. Wish them good luck. <br>

<br>
I'm confused as to how making a fair list of people equates to monopolizing a spawn. Surely this is sharing it more, since with the extra help both the cleric currently camping Rage and the cleric in the list below can be at least semi-confident that they'll be able to take him down before another raid force marches in.<br>
<br>
And do you not wait in queues in RL? A queuing system is a fair way of sorting out who got there first and who gets the &quot;reward&quot; first. Every member of the queue knows they will eventually get their turn based on when they joined it. The only problem with this is the queue-jumpers, or KSers. No-one is saying to you &quot;do what I say when I say&quot; - rather we're saying do you not think this is a fairer way to handle this? Do you not think that helping that cleric out who belongs to a smaller guild is worthwhile? Some clerics have had their Rage spawns trampled time after time simply because larger guilds have the better numbers and mobilisation to move in and take Rage out. If this queue system stops those clerics from being trampled, then I think it will have served its purpose.<br>
<br>
I hope that word will spread about the list and thus more people will become aware of it. If everyone on this board spreads the word between their guild and their friends, then I think the majority of the server will be covered. To the clerics that maintain this list and help out with it - stick with it, because I think it's a much more diplomatic way to solve the ongoing Rage dispute. Good luck to those doing the camping, if I'm ever in the area I'll be sure to drop by and keep you awake. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

When I went to SF found 2 clerics there waiting for the spawn, happened to be first and 2nd clerics on the list. They were both there and were covering times for each other while one slepted, showered, ate got laid or whatever you do while not camping rage. From how I understand it when he pops they will try and get the next oerson on the list who is expected to come and help out with the watch as well. The camp sucks, its long and I personaly have been through about 5 of these camps now not counting my own (2 in solb and 3 in SF now). <br>
    The fact that the list is maintaine in game cool and like that the clerics who are there actualy camping pass down the list and from what I have seen tend to not toss poeple on the list for a me too post on the boards. The camp sucks, the clerics are trying to work it out so that ist not as filled with strife. From what have seen its not just the small guilds who are using this but also the larg guilds. Now the thing is where the list will break down is when a cleric on the list does not come out and help with the time when they called. But will have to see. I might be way down there but am waiting and keeping company with those who are there. Making my desire for this camp known and helping out. <br>
    In the new post lucin world rage prob can be done with a single group in 20 sec just like the other kunark dragos are. Every one hates the camp but hopefuly there can be some respect and teamwork betwen all to try and make this camp painless.<br>

Currently there is a cleric sitting infront of the spawn and playing a lvl 60 Shaman on the other computer.  Her guild is not their in SF helping her.  They are off in Ssra temple.  Why should one person sitting in a zone be able to call claim to a spawn.  This happens no where else in the game.  In the end, this is a game.  And no one should have to sit in one spot for upto 18 days for a mob to spawn.  And even before you do that, have to wait known weeks before your name is up on the list.<br>
<br>
why cant Rage be like any other spawn in the game?  I dont see people sitting in EJ for Sev to pop so that they can get the scales.  I dont see people camping in Kael to lay claim to the King.  Dont get me wrong...This all started because VI fooked up.  They thought that the cleric epic was too strong and that they and to severly limit how many got into the game.  I dont think that anyone should be having to camp rage.  It should just be treated like any other spawn.  If you see it up and you can get your forces there, its yours.  I also dont beleive in kiting a mob around so that the others cant get a shot at it.<br>
<br>
This is my 2cp's worth.  I just dont think it would be possible for someone who works and has a family to be able to get a cleric epic.  Its the only one out there that is like this.  I know, Ranger Stones in hate are hard to get.  But you can clear the mini bosses in short order.  You can do Shissar in fear in less than an hour and a half.<br>

Their guidl does send people out to help watch as well, just cause they do not have a dozen people there at one time does not mean they are not suporting them. Alosof the watching being done has been between those working with the list, clerics helping and suporting eachother in game for this. And as a side effect those clerics making some new friends that they might not have had before. And always fun watching the breakdancing wurms when bored.

<br>
Ok, so Guild A has been sitting in SF for 4 days....Guild B has a cleric ready...Guild B comes in with more force and takes Rage...so Guild B's cleric has a rez stick...most likely to help with uber raids and stuff...while Guild A could have had it's very first epic cleric.   <br>
<br>
Conclusion:  Guild B and their cleric are impatient greedy selfish assholes...but they are going to be a greedy guild with an epic cleric.   There's nothing any of us can really do, but at least people are trying....with the exception of a few greedy selfish assholes.   We all know what the rules are, but do you have to use the rules to justify what I consider rudeness?<br>
