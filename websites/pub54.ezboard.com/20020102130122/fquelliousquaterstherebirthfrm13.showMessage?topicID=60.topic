<br>
example: my husband was in chardok (rl husband) with my cleric, someone by the name of neguvdar from a guild called denizen of shebaernons, offers him 10k for a rez. being the only cleric, and knowing hes not getting that much for a rez. (my husband doesnt mind doing such for peeps that can at least bring the corpse to him), he rezes this person, this person loots all of his corpse than gates. not even a thank you is rewarded for his time and mana. were not worryed about money but if you aint got the common courtesy, to say thank you, as in this case, than dont aske me for a rez/port. i hate people that dont say thank you, i'm sure your parents werent that stupid to let you grow up without any manners, i dont mind rezing/porting for no money but pls have a lil manners, i like to be thanked for wasting my hard earned eq time just to rez your sorry arse. (my comp cant handle much more than rezing or teleing, my husbands can)<br>
<br>
i dont mind rezing or porting for free, if i have the time, and i certainly dont expect 10k for a rez. damn thats outrages, but dont say you will pay it when your just messing with them, to get them to do it, and wont pay it, and plus at least say thank you, dont be a ignorant sob like this scumbag, i dont need money since i dont play to often, but a thank you, at least shows your momma had some smarts, when she had your silly arse<br>

Syllie is too nice a person to refuse a rez, but I'm not too nice a guy that I wont take offense.  I confronted him after he tip-stiffed her bad one night (he made her walk 1/2 way across the zone, then had her drain her mana on 2 rezzes).<br>
<br>
His response just made me shrug and give up...<br>

&quot;I only have 9pp on me, and didnt want to offend her&quot;<br>
<br>
Sooo... he had no problem making her walk 1/2 way across a zone, drain her mana, and basically waste a good hour of an entire group's playing time.  Then he gates without a word of thanks because he &quot;didn't want to offend her&quot;.<br>

<br>
I'll generally res someone once, maybe twice, with no expectation of money or other compenstation, but if you're rude to me and leave without even so much as a thank-you, you won't get a third chance.<br>
<br>
People can complain that it's just a few minutes' worth of mana, but it's more than that.  It's the fact that it took me a year and a half of playing the most boring class in EQ to get to the point where I can perform a 90% res.  If it's that easy, more people would do it, and resses would be free.  Clerics are one of the most sought-after classes for grouping, which supports the notion that it's an unattractive class to play, or else there'd be plenty of them.<br>

(sows are automatic though)...<br>
<br>
Most druids like last night (while I was playing my necro)  WOULD NOT EVEN ANSWER ME... when I politely asked if they had time for a quick port.... One said sure for 50pp..   I can tell one thing.. I'll never port anyone going on a epic raid for some of thoese people... <br>
<br>
But because I have no black list.. I can never remember who I dont like.. LOL.. so I end up only remembering the REAL bad ones..<br>
<br>
As for Rez's...  There are a few clerics out there I would drop anything I'm doing for.. becuase EVERY time I ask.. they leave their groups.. run 5 zones.. just to rez me...  Kalene, Bordamere, a few others when they are on.. starliegh, Oraa, and Apotheke also... dont be mad if I didnt post ya here...  you know who you are, and you know what I'd do for ya..  <br>
<br>
Hell Bordamere came from Kunark to Permafrost to rez me once...  It doesn't take many times of doing these types of things to a person to make a friend for EQ life... <br>
<br>
Saying that (I'm NOT going to name names).. I know a few (very few.. 2 that I can think of).. clerics that have blacklists that do not realize that they are blacklisted also.. that everytime they are looking for a group.. they sit there for ever.. Anytime a group wants a healer they ask me (a druid) rather than the cleric that lets people die all the time.. and anytime they want help campping something.. They get none...  pretty sad.. and I am glad I'm not part of it.. but still you reap what you sow in most cases.. (unless your like me and just dont remember).. <p><img src="http://freepages.ugo.com/Vis/files/SIG.jpg">

I have no clue why this guy ever made a cleric.  I grouped with him once in Crystal Caverns.  I was with friends, and we used our standard looting rules (Splits on, Need before Greed, and all cash items to the clerics to pay for Symbols).  A short while after we grouped up, someone asked for a Symbol.  He wanted 10pp... for a PINZARN!  Bwhahahahahaa!<br>
 <br>
We all damn near pissed ourselves laughing... until we realized that he was serious.  I think he still has my boot print on his arse.<br>
<br>
It doesn't even end there.  We wound up on the same Fear Raid a month or so later.  Guess what?  He &quot;forgot&quot; to bring any DOTs for symbols.  <br>
<br>
And... this one is the kicker...<br>
<br>
After I later found out that he's a Guild Leader, I bumped into him on a Fear raid that his guild was hosting.  Guess what?  He was DOTless again.  OMFG!   Bwahahahaha!<br>
<br>
must... stop... typing....<br>
laughing... too... hard...<br>

and i admit...when i play my druid, it's mostly just porting people for my groups, or porting friends, or auctioning. when i am playing him i am almost always busy, and/or in tell hells(what am i saying? i'm ALWAYS in tell hells) so i dont even SEE half the port/sow/buff requests. not to mention, /say doesn't stand out terribly well on my screen... so i'm probably one of the ones that people hate hahaha! made worse by the fact that i can only do one thing at a time, and seeing as how i am generally in constant tells, and trying to pay attention to several things...i'm usually pretty frustrated when i'm on my druid. which doesn't make me very pleasant to people begging for ports, every buff known to druid... sow though, i always do real quick if i see the request.<br>

Dotless Clerics is a disease and MUST BE STOPPED!!<br>

I always carry a stack on me...  But I'd rather have a RUNE V from a chanter than a symbol from a cleric anyday of the week.. (actually I'd rather have both )...<br>
<br>
My point was simply, clerics that have black lists should be careful, because .. err umm somthing about throwing stones in glass houses.. or somthing like that..<br>
<br>
FYI we did most all the FG's with 4 people<br>
=============================<br>
2 monks,<br>
1 pally, <br>
1 druid   (me)<br>
<br>
<br>
Notice NO chanters, and NO clerics.. I find myself doing so many things without clerics lately that I wouldn't dream of doing without them before..<br>
<br>
My Cleric is 33rd level.. and I can tell you now, it is sometimes hard to find groups.. <p><img src="http://freepages.ugo.com/Vis/files/SIG.jpg">

Sal lives in a cartoon world with fake everything except friendship.<br>
<br>
My friends know they can rely on me and know that I am a fair person.<br>
<br>
Unlike in RL I can outcast those that do me wrong in Norrath.<br>
I never even have to hear from them again if what they do offends me to the point of ignore.<br>
<br>
There are no glass houses in EQ for me because its a game, and im sure ill get over whatever happens to me in it.<br>
<br>
I play to have fun, why would I want to try and tolerate those that make the game UN-fun for me? Just so I have an easier time getting that phat loot? Or so I have an easier time getting from one place to another?<br>
<br>
This is my fantasy world no?<br>
<br>
Its not like im ruthless or anything.<br>
<br>
Shoot, ask Wyen, i've hated him for quite some time and I have yet to put him on ignore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
