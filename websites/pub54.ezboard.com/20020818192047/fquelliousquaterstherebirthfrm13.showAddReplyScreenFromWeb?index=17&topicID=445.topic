<br>
Reagan won the Cold War by his willingness to throw large sums of money at Star Wars, and the Russians couldn't keep up and went broke.  Ask Margret Thatcher.<br>
<br>
We also have Reagan to thank for the prosperity of the 90's and Clinton to thank for the recession of the 2000's.<br>

Oh, and Reagen won the cold war by ballooning military spending by siphoning all money away from important domestic programs resulting in a massive debt.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if half of the bush administration would put down their bibles and pick up a history book they might actually learn something useful.  War NEVER stops killing, it only redirects who's being killed.  <br>
<br>
The Iraqies dont attack the US cause they are just genetically preprogramed to hate all americans, as some news agencies might seem have you think.  They are pissed off because the U.S. has been extremely exploitive and manipulative in their dealings with Mideast countries.  We demand that they let us get their oil, but at the same time have the nerve to demand that they comply to our ways.  If your friend loses his job and you let him come live YOUR house, then he starts complaining about how your bed isn't made, orders you to prepare him a special vegetarian meal for dinner, then whines cause you didn't put enough lettuce on the salad, and then refuses to leave when you ask, you're not gonna be to happy either.  Jebus, he's in YOUR house ordering YOU around!  Thats the situation in the middle east and Sadaam is the only one that said &quot;No, I'm not going to tolerate this, get out&quot;.  We're so friggin addicted to their oil nipple we just cant let go yet we continue to try and order these countries around like THEY are the ones in OUR territory.  Thats no kind of negotiating position!  As long as we're stuck on the oil, there's no way there will ever be peace between the middle east and the U.S..  Taking out Sadaam aint gonna fix a damn thing.  Until we ween ourselves off that dope, we're going to be dependant on mideast oil, and thus, unable to negotiate in a reasonable manner.  <br>
<br>
We claim that Sadaam is some kind of living satan, and that no other people in the world suffer as much as those in Iraq.  The government tries to pass this off as a humanitarian mission and that we are freeing the oppressed people of Iraq and that once Sadaam is dead, the Iraqi women will be free to rip off their veils, and dance gidily around in the streets, a la Juilie Andrews in the sound of music, while the men and the children clap their hands to the beat of the uptemo sitar music and the world will be free of oppression and tyrany forever!  Sorry, not gonna happen.  The fact of the matter is this, there are places in the world where conditions are immesureably more deplorable than in Iraq.  For instance, lets take Uganda.  There you have a military general declaring genocide upon another tribe.  Millions slaughtered, but nobody in the U.S. gives a shit.  Why?  Because they dont have any oil do they.  They have nothing we need.  The Iraq mission isn't about being humanitarian, its about oil.<br>
<br>
Oh but we're in luck, thanks to the supreme court we've got an oil man in the white house, actually, LOTS of oil men!  Surely they'll want to help us become less dependant on foreign oil.  I really love their plan to spend 10 years and 40 bagillion million dollars building an oil pipeline up in the Alaskan wilderness to get a 6 month supply of oil so that we'll be free of foreign oil between January and July of 2012!  Thats just the kind of inginuity and forward thinking thing we need.<br>
<br>
No I'm not a Sadaam lover so dont start flaming me like I'm some kind of traitor.  Clearly the way he choses to go about fighting back at the U.S. is nowhere near the top of the &quot;good things to do&quot; list.  I am simply pointing out the often overlooked issues that are present in this situation.  Remember, when you're pointing the finger at someone, you've got 3 pointing back at you.  We as a country seem to forget that a lot.<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Anyway, the first thing that needs to be done is a huge increase towards the development of alternative fuel sources.  We can't negotiate effectively as long as we're dependant on oil from the region.  Then...maybe if we redirected some of this inflated military spending towards domestic and international aid programs, diplomatic relations initiatives, and public schools, we might one day raise a generation capable of dealing with conflict through less barbaric means.  One can only hope.<br>

<br>
The Electoral College has been around for a looong time, Bush used it to his advantage and Gore ignored it.  Why did the supreme court have to make a decision in the first place?  Bush won Florida, so by all rights he gets all of Florida's votes.  When one of them refused to cast her vote, then it had to be litigated.  It only came to that because of sore losers.  I only brought it up because Bubba mentioned it first.<br>
<br>
So, at least you admit Reagan won the Cold War.  Thanks to him we don't have to fear Mutually Assured Destruction and all that BS.  He destroyed the &quot;Evil Empire&quot;, thank-you Mr President.  Now, we can look at becoming allies with Russia, a much better solution than a real war.  I would do the same thing by spending money to save lives.<br>

<br>
The point your missing is the hipocrasy that Bush exudes. <br>
<br>
Fact: Bush is on a mission against terrorism, and those that harbor terrorists.<br>
<br>
Fact: The U.S. has hit civilian installations in its many attempts to &quot;right the wrongs&quot; made against others and our selves. Examples include but are not limited to; countless villages in Vietnam, the Chinese Embassy, &quot;an old folks home&quot; in Afganistan, countless civilian buildings in Iraq and Afganistan, and who knows what else!<br>
<br>
Fact: Most of these transgressions occured in conflicts not wars.<br>
<br>
Fact: The laws that others violate, but the U.S. is immune to are written by the U.S. under the pen name of the U.N. and other &quot;multilateral international organizations&quot;.<br>
<br>
My point is that Bush is trying to elminate terrorism with even more terrorism. The only difference is that he is terrorising non-americans. That is hipocracy(sp?) at its finest friend. He is, at best, a blubbering fool when it comes to foreign relations, demonstrated by the fallout of relations and fallout of peace in the mideast since his arival at the white house. <br>
<br>
Saying that violence breeds violence is a studitiy in this case, is just wrong, not to mention you don't really give a reason to not act like a hot head. Thats why the nations leaders are there to stop the &quot;fanatcism&quot; that comes with peoples interests being at risk. That is why they are called negotiations, and peace talks. I agree terrorists shouldn't be negotiated with, but Bush doesn't negotiate with anything/anyone that is what makes him a poor president. <br>
<br>
And its Tom Daschel, the next president of the U.S. unless a Kennedy is reincarnated.<br>

Everyone has their transgressions, but someone has to not part take in them for the evil to stop...<br>

Military is probably our only viable answer for the al queda but not Bush style hard nosed bull. It will only create more response along the same lines as Sept. 11th, and it already has.<br>

<br>
Read or watch the news to know WTF I'm taking about with the van.  A couple for elderly men (one 50 something and the other 60 something) lost control of their van and hit some people on the sidewalk in Chicago, injuring the pedestrians.  Bystanders pulled them out of the van and beat them to death with a brick.<br>
<br>
My point is there is a difference between an accident and an intentional act of violence.<br>

Thats how Bush acts with everything, he gets his blood pressure up and viola another statement about kicking some ass and asking questions later. Political leaders are supposed to think and respond with the nations interest in mind, not with the mind of a vigilante.<br>
<br>
And plowing into a crowd of people is still violent weather it is an accident or not.<br>
<br>
Don't deny transgressions of the U.S. military in the past, present or the future we write the rules so it seems like we don't violate them. But we respond with the same fevor and aggression that everyone else does, it doesn't make us right. It makes us hypocritical.<br>

We don't know what exectly happened with the van, since some idiots killed the 2 elderly me, but it was probably an accident.<br>
<br>
Do you think there is no difference between premeditated murder, and an accidental death?  Let me help you, one is evil and needs to be punished, while the other is unfortunate, shit happens.<br>
<br>
I don't deny what happened in the past, but it doesn't mean we had it coming.  Those people in the World Trade Center did nothing to those hijackers, they didn't deserve to die.  That's like saying the rape victim dressed like a whore, so she had it coming.<br>

<br>
Pheonix I will not defend, however their objective was military and they were fighting an enemy that frequently cloaked themselves in the guise of civilians. This was, after all one of the main objectives of pheonix, trying to identify the enemy, and to neutralize them. So while they hit 'civilian targets' it was not for the purpose of just killing civilians. It was because they determined that they were not actually civilians. Granted they made this determination on their own, and with no oversight, and made mistakes.<br>
<br>
There <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a difference between someone killing someone else because you think they are secretly an enemy and killing civilians for the mere purpose of enstilling terror.<br>
<br>
I only point that out because you lump Viet Nam in with Bosnia and Iraq. Which I think is not appropriate, because there is a tremendous qualitative difference between them. In Viet Nam we did deliberately hit 'civilian' targets. In Bosnia or Iraq we did not. If you think so it is you who needs to reconnect to reality. The US does not need to engage in terrorism, and there is no benefit to doing so. Certainly civilian targets get hit, but that's why it's so hard to make the decision to enter into these activities. If you do so you are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> going</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to have some very difficult apologies to make before it is done.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yes accidents happen, but only when you lose your head. - Koradina<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think it is also worth noting that Bosnia and Somalia both were Clinton activities. So I guess Clinton lost his head.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It will only create more response along the same lines as Sept. 11th, and it already has. - Koradina<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Our complacency and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> lack</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of response is what encouraged them to try that. Intelligence experts have been warning for a while that something like this would occur, but they were ignored.<br>
<br>
They aren't being ignored now.<br>
