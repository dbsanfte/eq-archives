Yes 200 was what my conservative estimate assumed, tho I imagine honestly you would beat that on a kunark dragon.<br>
<br>
And then you go on to poor mouth rangers..<br>
<br>
Look I have nothing against ranger power. I think it's great that they get what they get, even if it is a hell of a lot of work to get it. I think other classes need to have similar things. Basically all the GOOD AA, slayer, mb, am, dc (and to an extent MC for bards that swarm) are incredibly powerful in a narrow set of circumstances. I think that is correct.<br>
<br>
It is a problem that a couple classes got hosed in this. Warriors have nothing comparable. Mages don't. IT makes it hard to find reason to grind post 60 when there's no reward.<br>

Sigh. Sephrok you know that crap does not help your point. It is quite telling that you have to resort to adolescent calibre slurs. Or any any slurs.<br>
<br>
In any case I need no excuse. I do not need anyone to excuse me. I'm not doing anything wrong, my behavior with respect to MB has been exemplary and more polite than is the server convention for contests. Most burners behave similarly, that I know. I'm sure there have been and will be poor behavior, but it's not me. Further I am not concerned about MB getting nerfed. Yes VI has changed their minds before, however, not quickly, and PoP is on the horizon. It's unlikely that anything will change with MB until PoP comes out and assiciated bugs are addressed. Then it may be reasonable to address kunark mob trivialization, but it will be in light of PoP geared chars. Which I wager will remove the last vestige of real challenge from these mobs.. for all classes. At which point it will be illogical to merely nerf MB. Not that it already isn't but it will be plainly apparent to even the most shortsighted.<br>
<br>
But Sephrok, if you can be civil for a second, do you find any reason why a handful of high aa rangers could not kill one of these mobs? Assuming pull to a spot of your choice.. say pull gore to the open plain in front of KC. Rangers in a wide kill circle with long range ammo, and a sacrificial bard pulling to the middle. At extreme range I doubt the rangers would get aggro, and even if one did I don't think gore would live long enough to kill more than one. Certainly you are doing too mch damage for CH to get off, even with one dead ranger. Conservatively 1000dps with 5 rangers, 800dps even if one gets eaten. Bard likely dies and maybe one ranger.. but I'm pretty sure gore dies, and fast.<br>

Montyy. Use your head for once, and stop repeating the same illlogical thing. I have said repeatedly if there is a system for any spawn I will honor it and further support it. If the mob is FFA then it's FFA. Get over it. If Rage goes FFA then it will be FFA to. FFA means FFA. Why is that so confusing for you? Or you want FFA but your only competition is who you decide it should be? Get real.<br>

I'll work on it.<br>
<br>
As for a 23 AA limit that doesn't work because 1) will be impossible to find 6 people with exactly 23AA, 2) burn hits never have 5 23aa wizzies, it never happens, 3) I would not be comfortable on a burn with 5 23AA wizzies.. there's always a mix and high aa wizzies to take up tha dmg slack, 4) all classes do not get useful abilities at the same point. For example I'd like to see one of the group with WC3, which would be a min of 36aa.<br>

<br>
So, lets say we hypothetically get 5 rangers setup to launch arrows at gore.. start with ~500 dps.. within the first 5 seconds, gore will either run to or summon a ranger and kill him/her.. she'll probably proc AE fear / AE 750 dmg + slow.. range on that slow is quite large, i wasn't able to avoid it with arrows last time we did Gore.. (which was a while back).. so we're down to probably 100-200 dps with the remaining 4 rangers being slowed or feared, gore probably at about 90% .. summons / kills the rest of the rangers.. would likely get gore down by 80% max..<br>
<br>
But OMFG the dragons get to use their abilities that VI so cleverly programmed in to make the encounters fun / challenging / whatever.. and yes they are still challenges to many.  What is the point of them having those abilities if they can't use them at all when they drop dead instantly in front of you? You still havn't answered that FK and i've only asked like 5 times..<br>
<br>
<br>
Gay you said whats the difference when the fail rate of a 5 person MB team is EQUAL TO the fail rate of a 30 person raid that normally kills gore..  rofl.. that's balanced?<br>

Well,  this is what you call a lose/lose bet.<br>
<br>
There are 2 possible outcomes to this:<br>
<br>
The non wizard team fails, showing MB being imbalancing<br>
<br>
The non wizard team succeeds, showing the MB sqaud being greedy  compared to the other classes who never set up a hotline to farm the dragons.<br>
<br>
<br>
What outcome is FK putting her money on?<br>
<br>
Disclaimer: I'm solidly behind the ability being imbalanced.  If I could one-click a dragon I'd do it also.  It's human nature.  How often you do it and how much ground you give to others varies, but in general the problem is the skill not the players. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

Seph I have answered it, you just didn't like the answer. The answer is they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> trivialized period. Hits on these mobs rarely fail anymore. (with the exception of burns which do fail) It takes more time for a traditional MT kill but they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> rarely</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fail Sephrok. The strats are tried, tested, and true. It's not hard to get enough people with gear/level now. They just aren't a real challenge.<br>
<br>
It will only get worse. People don't buy expansions that don't enhance their toon. It's simple as that. Toons get more powerful. Mobs generally don't.

<br>
If you want to draw a line in the sand and say &quot;ok THESE mobs need to be protected from trivialization&quot; like they did with nag/vox then sure, I understand. But that's not a MB only issue. It's a level/aa/gear issue. It's like going after SUV owners because their vehicles pollute more. Sure they may pollute more but they don't pollute <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> exclusively</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Taxing SUVs to hell doesn't remove the problem.<br>
<br>
MB is just the ability one class got at the expense of a lot of xp and buying a new expansion. But it's not the only one.<br>
<br>
MB is not the only manifestation of mudflation.<br>

Ok, back to the meat...<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So, lets say we hypothetically get 5 rangers setup to launch arrows at gore.. start with ~500 dps.. within the first 5 seconds..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First off dragon roar is range 300. With a shdows, doom, or even thunderbolt and rng 50 arrows you can get 300 range. Also archery at extreme range has very little aggro. Placement would be important, but a sacrificial bard (and I say bard because of DA song.. a well buffed war with defensive and AE taunt may do as well) holding aggro in the middle of a wide circle should be able to stay at the edge of fear range. Some may get feared but I suspect they would not get summonned. And if they did I don't think he could kill all 5 before getting killed himself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ..would likely get gore down by 80% max..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok lets say 80%... I can deal with that. If 5 can get it to 80 then 6 ought to do it. Honestly I'm not sure 5 couldn't, but ok 6. Certainly 7. I'd sure like to see it tried. TB's are droppable, I'm sure anyone with am3 would have as good or better. It's just getting that many am3 rangers together.. would be hard. But worth doing.<br>

......... right.... there's the kitchen sink 8(  Archery has aggro.. just as much as nuking etc.. and.. MB has 0 aggro? wtf.<br>
<br>
I bet you ~10k (thats all my poor ass has since i can't take on dragons with my fellow rangers) not even 10 rangers could do Gore.  If AE wasn't an issue (like it isn't with MB) and if Gore didn't summon (again.. like it is with MB).. then yeah, of course it'd be possible.  But thats not the case.<br>
<br>
Btw, learn game mecahnics, you can't hold aggro with DA.  If a bard DA'd gore would go after the rangers... there is no such thing as DA tanking anymore unless you are solo.<br>
<br>

<br>
5s buff thingy on MB wouldn't make it useless it'd just prevent wizards from being able to solely do dragons but still be just as useful as before.. but that'd take away your income.. therefor its bad.. which leads to you pulling kitchen sinks out of your ass.. aka poor ass excuses / word twisting / trying to turn it around on other classes. <p><center>

Though I do believe 5 rangers with max archery, archery buff spell and and a bard could take out a dragon, it wouldn't be a dragon of Gore's status and above. Ragefire might could be done but luck will run a major factor into it. Anytime the monster is moving or rooted, then archery looses half of it's damage. Include that with people that get in the way, wall bug, target is too high/low and monsters able to dodge/parry arrows, an archery fight can turn into a loosing battle very suddenly.<br>
<br>
I still remember when archery didn't even do critical damage for rangers, only warriors had it and reason why they did was because Verant made all their attacks have a chance of critical attack. Not only did archery have bad damage, it was also a very expensive skill to get up. Tolan's bracer wasn't around and fletching made one arrow at a time. It was a great pulling skill for warriors though. I have found flame lick to be a better pulling skill for rangers on none summon mobs due to the many groups you might have to pull through. It keeps great aggro so that it doesn't add on to others pull. Of course it all depends on the situation at hand to determine which pulling method to use.<br>
<br>
Archery is a great secondary skill to have but by all means it is not as over powered as most people make it out to be. Only draw back to MB is the no mana afterwards and refresh timer. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontyydaogre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montyy Da Ogre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Anti Manaburn<br>Fat Ass <font color=orange>Flame King</font></span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/20/02 3:58:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=522>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> Bah, Seph what do you know about Archery?

Of course they do Sephrok. They do all the time. They don't buy a game that you START being able to easily succeeed. But people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> expect</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be able to progress to a point in any game where old challenges are trivialized. In fact people get pissed off if they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> cannot</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> advance.<br>
<br>
I expect to take my hell level geared necro in d2 back to normal level and have some fun slaughtering with impunity. I expect to take my squad of flying suit hvy plasma'd agents and wipe out a scout ufo with 2 greys. I expect to take my carriers and wipe out that annoying island sea nation that's been a thorn in my side but doesn't have any air power, now that I have air power. I expect my kitted out marauder to take out a wasp with impunity.<br>
<br>
In fact that is part of the reward for playing.<br>
<br>
Advancement.<br>
<br>
As exemplified by things that used to be a challenge no longer being a challenge.<br>
<br>
Would I buy a game that there was no challenge to progressing and I could win easily from the start? No. But having worked for something one does want to enjoy the rewards of that effort.<br>

<br>
Hmm not sure why you would think this at your level.. but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> part</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of that is correct at least.. 'just as much as nuking' and range is a huge factor in aggro for nuking. Which I well know. If I am at range my chance of getting summonned is less. Thought everyone knew this.<br>
<br>
And MB does not have 0 aggro. It has very low aggro, less than one successful taunt. It does have aggro though.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Btw, learn game mecahnics, you can't hold aggro with DA. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Thanks for the update. I know the mechanics Sephrok.. that's why the bard dies. But DA can slow down the process. No question it would be interesting.<br>
<br>
But a war with AE taunt and defensive may be able to do the job better, if we assume one sacrifice anyway.<br>

Really then why did I suggest all 23+ aa toons be nerfed from the mobs? If that is my real concern? That would be a fair nerf. It would hit all classes equally. It would REALLY keep the mobs at least somewhat challenging, and stop the potential for any other small groups or omg even worse, non 'balanced' groups from killing them.<br>
<br>
You want to nerf, ok lets all get nerfed. If its not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> possible</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for it to be done with any other class mix then what difference does it make? If it's about 'preserving' 'midlevel content' for the 'appropriate' people then this does it and has the further benefit of not being open to ANY other 'abusive' tactics. Whether we have dreamed them up yet or not.<br>
<br>
We shut the door once and for all. And in a way that does not hit just one class. Fairly.<br>

I didn't call you an idiot. I knew someone would take the bait (and I didn't think it would be Sephrok btw) of saying archery dps cant be that high, if I didn't support it.
