Heh.... Opal one of the things you will have to learn if yer recruiting with one of us ubah guilds is sarcasm.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You also learn that you cannot get ahead in this game without pissing somebody off, no matter what you do.... you cannot advance in this game without some friction with either the people you are &quot;catching up to&quot;, or the people you are &quot;leaving behind&quot;. <br>
<br>
Fortunately as of late the folks at the top end have kept thigns to a minimum, tho you still got random mudslingers and @#%$ disturbers in the peanut gallery. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

<br>
lets start with a huge yes i did say i would rape mk, while i was pissed off, please find one person in mk i tried to recruit though.<br>
<br>
oh we werent friends? oh dam 1 thing most people know is anything and i mean anything that has to do with mk i keep logs on wether it be:<br>
<br>
Accussations toward members<br>
Members complaining about members<br>
or Ari complaining about her old man<br>
<br>
basically anything that had to do with mk, so lets not talk about screenshots nor logs, cause i got plenty.<br>
<br>
Far as AoI goes we were never officers --oh oh someone lied<br>
<br>
Far as starting the new guild oh beautiful log of you asking us to do it and asking if you could join..oh oh 2-faced<br>
<br>
oh the talk with nemglani you moderated more logs of all your tells specially the ones apologizing to me for not believing me--oh 2faced yet again?<br>
<br>
oh oh the conversation with you in IC playing your hubby aahhh doh you told me it was you.<br>
<br>
least i know now who was talking trash to people in mk triing to start crap.<br>
<br>
The Hate raid ahhh geez ya i tried to run a personal hate raid to get my epic and yes i only invited people that would have fun and not screw it up!! oh did we forget to mention that all the loot made was given to MK's Bank because it was empty?<br>
<br>
Far as triing to get back into mk it was the same day we left.  Did want leadership tags hell know. would i have taken em? Dam straight! if it ment cleaning up mk so it was fun again.<br>
<br>
Far as @#%$ this or @#%$ that, screenshots oh i am scared like i care  matter of fact i will say it here and save you the trouble.<br>
<br>
First the F to your old man was me agreeingwith him that it was F-up that only like 6 people from MK had bother to speak to him since he left.<br>
<br>
any other F comments were simple and one of 2 things.<br>
<br>
Alot of MK is F-ups that couldnt make it in a uber guild.<br>
<br>
That MK has entirely to many 2faced F's in it.<br>
<br>
Guess that why you like it so much you fit right in with all the 2faced people.<br>
<br>
oh and if i forgot something people feel free to post it, wether it be screenshot or log or just word of mouth cause it really dont matter at all.<br>
<br>
But all this childish BS and drama MK still has a bunch of great people andonly a few dips.<br>
<br>
Far as the elite Guild idea, geez the first person to talk to me about it or i spoke to about it was your old man like over a year ago, which was when theguild name Destiny's fire  was approved.<br>
<br>
Thanx for the attention save your drama for someone who cares.<br>
<br>
oh oh i almost forgot  i got a beautiful screenshot of you thanking me for standing up for you on one post or another cant remember which--oh oh can we say 2faced?<br>

3.  I don't log on my old man to defend myself.<br>
<br>
NO Avis/Stawker I never considered you a friend and I was congenial to you until last month.  I rarely talked to Opal unless it was a hello, I never had any bad experiences with her.<br>
<br>
Like I told you, if you disliked so many people in MK so much, why didn't you just reform.  YOU placed the blame on Opal and said she wouldn't do it.  YOU didn't do it because you didn't want to take the slack from the ones you didn't invite back.  So why not leave gracefully, why delete guildmajic and attempt to delete the guild site? If you wanted me to stay out of it, why didn't you just refrain from telling me lies about how bad MK was treating you?  If I apologized, it was because I can say I'm wrong....and at the time I thought you may have been right.  Asking you to form an uber guild so I could join, *note sarcasm*. <br>
 <br>
And the point of the post...it always amazes me that people like Avis are always unaccountable for bad behavior because too many nice people out there never say anything.  But, I don't feel like being nice.  Maybe I am a bit deranged *shrug* <br>
<br>
And to the other people, yes I do jump guilds....why, because I am intolerant and have no desire to continuously try to deal with people.   Mememe...yes that too at times, never for loot, never for lack of supporting friends...I bail on situations I have no desire to be in*shrug*<br>
<br>
Summary: Avis/Stawker is a PoS who hides behind his wife's good name to further his own agenda.  MY personal opinion expressed in a public forum.  I'm either a nice person sick of people like him or I'm a mudslinging judgemental bitch....take it as a warning or add me to your black list *shrug*.<br>

A day ago...<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> MK wouldn't let Opal on a ToV raid right after she left.

<br>
So you didn't flame Opal, huh? I'm sure she feels a lot better reading that. If you're gonna try to pass some BS for the truth at least go back and edit your original statement.<br>
<br>
&quot;And the point of the post...it always amazes me that people like Avis are always unaccountable for bad behavior because too many nice people out there never say anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
Those poor, docile people. Incapable of speaking for themselves. I'm sure they're desperate to thank you for exposing their inner-guild conflict. They couldn't do it themselves with so much malice to go around.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, because I am intolerant and have no desire to continuously try to deal with people.&quot;<br>
<br>
Did you ever stop to think that maybe you have a hand in these problems with guilds?<br>
<br>
&quot;Avis/Stawker is a PoS who hides behind his wife's good name to further his own agenda. MY personal opinion expressed in a public forum.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you have the slightest inkling about relationships? You *know* Opal's going to stand by her man, just as you admit you would do. I wonder if you think she should be grateful for &quot;exposing&quot; your view of the truth to everyone.<br>
<br>
Out of all this @#%$ one thing remains. It'd taken 10 seconds to cut Avis off once he started getting on your nerves. How much time have you spent brewing on the pair? Why didn't you work up the nerve to tell them exactly how you felt with so many opportunities? Oh ya, so you could get a chance to say how much you hate the mememe types.<br>

You, my dear, have no discretion whatsoever.

<br>
LOL, when ever i hear someone say &quot;my old man&quot; it reminds me of that cher movie where dates the biker and has the kid with the messed up face.<br>
<br>
anyway, not slammin you guys or anything...i just think it is funny that you call your significant others my old man, or woman or whatever.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Now Im seeing the Side that I never knew of, thanx for fulfilling my question, Ari was right about quite a few things about you.... Im lvl 51 and I am proud of it, I dont wish to be &quot;Ubah&quot; and never will be, Yea your right a lot of people in MK are not &quot;Ubah&quot; but some just play for the fun of it, unlike some people. BTW You will not see me in any other guild soon, cause MK is strong. Lets get that fact straight plz, ty<br>

people new it upset me greatly that some people couldnt make it to raids on time even though they were online, it upset me greatly that it would take mk up to 2 hours to get a raid up and running, and it upset me that quite a few only came to raids they could get something out of, only about 30 people out of 100+ came to raids steadily. <br>
and yet people would scream murder about getting help with what they wanted done.  Yup i may be wrong but i don't think that kind of additude would cut it in a uber guild.<br>
<br>
lets please keep this going.....since i cant get onto eq, atleast i will be entertained tonight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usarrex.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sarrex </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/24/02 7:22:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=413.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A gnomes i despise</span><hr size=1> Hate to see two of the nicest people I have met in this game get slammed so I'm going to throw in my two bits. Ari I really cant help but wonder WHY you would even publish your point of view(not TRUTH, as you would have us believe) in this forum unless you have some sort of F'ed up problem with Opal and Avis. They are two people I would be proud to have wearing AS tags. Ari perhaps you need to up the dosage on the Prozac or perhaps switch to Paxil(it worked wonders for me) and chill the Fuckout.<br>
