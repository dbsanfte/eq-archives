/sigh<br>
<br>
By the way, where does one go about getting a shotgun in EQ?  Is that like a uber drop off of mobs in VT or something?<br>
<br>
<br>
Man, I would be one bad ass necro sending my pet in on mobs and following up with blasts from the good ole peacemaker!<br>
<br>
PS: Is the shotgun a no drop?  Can i buy it in bazaar? Couple that with my epic and i would be immortal!<br>

I have friends in both guilds and a former member of UP....<br>
<br>
I am very glad the mana burn wizards do not follow the same MO on mana burning mobs as Radiant did... woot got mana burn in...<br>
<br>
I am glad the enchanters have it worked out.. Amaya is a very sweet person.. and I am sure the radiant enchanter is to...... Cazel can be done by a loan necro FYI, taking over 40plus minutes to kill... and I am willing to help as needed..<br>
<br>
Hate - Long time ago... I know we (UP) were up and were clearing to Maestro.. was almost clear to him... and radiant came up and aggro'd the Maestro.. after killing the few of them up it visited our camp.... killing most... after rezzing, clearing the rest the way to Maestro and killing him... Radiant decided to leave the zone... After clearing alot of the first floor we should not have had to race to kill the Maestro... <br>
<br>
Hate recent - have no clue...<br>
<br>
I do not believe that UP would ever intentionally train a guild or anyone for that matter... I have known ulwern for a long time.. that is not his MO, or UP's... ..As a member of UP we have left hate on many occasions just because another guild was there...  My rl brother and friends are all still in UP.. Training folks is not what they are about... <br>
<br>
I have no reason to believe that Radiant would intentionally train either.. always been nice to me...... <br>
<br>
as a fyi, I have /q out of hate logged back in and still had aggro... kept it for 2, /q's finally rebooted my pc and that seemed to have worked...<br>
<br>
Really think all of this is misunderstanding...... In the end it is good to see the Enchanters work this out... and I am always game to fear kite Cazel.... <br>

We were not racing you to Maestro that night.  We were told by your raid leader that you were not interested in first floor mobs and were heading up to the second floor to kill Inny.  Maestro aggro'd when I pulled mobs from the entrance to the throne room and even though I was FD'd in a safe spot, proceeded to wipe out our camp.  I have pulled Maestro many times and he doesn't move unless I want him to move.  Somebody, either you guys or us, had some chain aggro going that time or he would have never made it to the camp.  <br>
<br>
We left hate shortly after that because even though you guys still said that you were heading upstairs, you proceeded to stay in the throne room and intercept every pull I brough by.  We camped out and came back the next morning with Inny still up, knowing full well that we were decived.  <br>
<br>
That is where this began and is why we weren't willing to play nice Friday night.  I do know that we did not bring that train and I also watched you guys all /quit and then come back and ninja-loot our corpses while we continued fighting.  You're saying you didn't bring it, then how come you had some deaths?  Mobs clearly aggro'd some of you guys first.  After this shit was done and we moved down a bit, I brought a pull of about 10 mobs and ran right passed you and not one mob stopped to hit you guys.  They all followed me to our camp.  Had we pulled that first mess, alll of you would have been still standing at the end. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uledronesoultaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ledrone Soultaker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/23/02 12:02:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=534.topic&index=111>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good ole Radiant? eh?</span><hr size=1> Vald, you're crowding my dark side again!!<br>

Cazel solo...hmmm. Tried it, had him, got adds, zoned. I haven't killed him solo....yet. Valshoon may have? Can't remember.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to resolve this is go to the arena and kick the shit out of Salta for awhile. You need a common enemy, and Salta is damn sure an enema! /snicker <p><center><img src=http://i.xanga.com/lfanninc/tattlelc.jpg img> <br>

And do call on me anytime. Also Thank's Medicco for getting me on the right mobs during the trainage. I am not sure where they came from. We were there one minute trying to decide where we want to go next and then poof tons of mobs and extra peeps. Either way we all lived and took the mobs down. I think we had our epic cleric camp towards the end just in case we needed rezzes but all in all we had 10 or so of us left standing. Tegdain and myself I know for sure. There is no Q'ing out for us warriors. And yes i was on the wrong mob a few times until we got down to me and Teg in our group. I will take the blame and again thank Medicco for getting me on the right assist....=) There was no ninja looting, that would not be possible without getting the exp, it was more like cleaning up left overs but hmmmmm.....left overs are good, even to us DE's. i will reimburse if you really believe that there was someting that valuable left. Not sure about the next pull coming through us, if they did i missed em and so did the ones getting rezzed. Either way all in all I got a few new friends and maybe a few enemies out of the deal. Also got to work with some old friends to help take out a few. Sorry this happened all and the ones I know and even the ones i do not, call on me anytime....maybe a few exceptions up to the progress from here...hehe<br>
<br>
As for the thought on Ulwern, he has brought me to where I am today and I am very thankful for that. He has helped me work my way up since 35 and I know he is a good guy. Inspect me sometime, I can probably list you 5-10 peices that he has either helped me get or that he has handed to me. As I will for our warriors coming up the ranks...<br>
<br>
Raehn call on me anytime again. I have a full well rounded group that will come to assist anytime we're on. Just name it, i owe you one atleast.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;PEACE ALL!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Good to see ya out Bro!!!<br>
<br>
Oh yeah....Choclate Chip for me please....lol<br>
