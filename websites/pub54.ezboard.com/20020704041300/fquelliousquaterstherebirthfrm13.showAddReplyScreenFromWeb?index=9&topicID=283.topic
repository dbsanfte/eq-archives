<br>
You obviously misunderstood what I was trying to say because I had no desire to drudge up old issues.   You came to your guild's defense, I do not blame you.  I will not state what I think of your guild, there's an endless thread about that.   However, you threatened me with retribution and ended your post with sarcasm, asking me how I liked your nice guy routine.   I didn't think you were being nice actually.  And I think you really made yourself look like a dick now.  Did you think I wouldn't respond?  No hon, you were counting on it so you could have your chance to flame me.   You read more into my post than was intended.  I can't apologize for that.<br>
<br>
As to me referring to myself as a bitch, well...after being a smart ass back to you, I felt like a bitch.   I won't meekly stand by with my thumb up my ass while @#%$ goes on around me.  I express what I think.....no pretenses, no excuses, no shyness and definitely no deceit.  You don't want to hear my opinion, don't come to the board or read my posts.  You disagree with my post, flame back *shrug*.<br>
<br>
If you consider this retribution, you need to take lessons hon.  Think I'll lose sleep over your opinion of me.....muhahaha, you overrate your self worth.   You have never grouped with me.  You have never guilded with me.  You don't know @#%$ about me.   My friends know me...that is all that matters.<br>
<br>
And as to those that come to my defense, I haven't asked a single person to.  I'm a big girl, I say what I think and I sure can handle the slack that I get from it.  <br>
<br>
I do beg you not to steal my moss snakes, my beastlord still needs the scales for buffs I think.  She'd be totally devastated to lose her and the cubby's buffs.<br>

Of course, then the thread went downhill with everyone calling everyone else a liar.. unlike the more civilized SotU vs. ADD thread, which to the credit of both parties involved remained more civil.  I think the comparison is fair, because in retrospect it does show people how to properly wage a flamewar, by calmly stating your points rather than throwing names around.  Yeah, it's not quite as flamy that way, but you're more likely to win people over to your side than by saying things like &quot;You're a ****ing ***** and I ****ing hope you die you ****sucking maggot&quot;, or &quot;I feign pulled the Wraith of the Shissir from like 10 Amygdalan knights solo&quot; or other nonsense. *Looks innocent*<br>

However I don't even see an acceptable resolution....1) I say SotU did absolutely nothing wrong...2) I quit posting...neither is likely to happen. <br>
<br>
You said you were awaiting my reply, I responded.  You then ponder why I would find it necessary to respond ...doh.   My so called infraction...I stated my opinion in an open forum over an incident, and yes I was there for Ragefire.   What do you want... me to state that SotU was COMPLETELY in the right?  You will not change my mind about what happened,  there are VI rules and just plain common courtesy.   I was stunned to see that ADD would follow Radiant into Fear and to the temple.   It reminded me of what happened, as I'm sure it reminded other people.<br>
<br>
Now, if your skin is so thin that you can't tolerate a referral to the Ragefire incident, maybe there's a reason why you are so touchy about it.   And my dear, you are not reflecting well on your guild, good thing I look at people's behavior versus the tag they wear.  To me, you are coming across as a total ass.  You tell me to keep my opinion to myself...this is a message board, you were in the flame section....generally people voice their opinion.  If their opinion upsets you to the point where you feel it necessary to threaten them with retribution, don't come here.  <br>
<br>
As to retribution...is that how you operate?  Things don't go your way and people don't bow at your feet so you threaten them?   Does that come with the uber mentality...the I'm-so-great-you-should-worship-me-and-I-belong-to-an-uber-guild attitude?   I'm not worried about what you intend to do to me.  I am flattered that you deem me so important that you will be devoting your time to constructing some evil plot against me...muhahahah.   If you think that this was a public humiliation, it wasn't.  I am proud of the fact that I express my opinion on topics that having bearing on our community instead of standing idly by and accept bad behavior.   Like I said, my friends know me, what you think of me will not lower their opinion....well, not of ME anyway.<br>
<br>
Other than the Ragefire incident, I have started maybe two flame posts...one over how I hate EC and trading and the other over how people want to use chat channels.   I tried to add a sense of humor to them even if the incidents irritated me.   So if that makes me a mud slinging bitch...so be it.  Just wondering hon, what does that make you?   I always thought that my comments were rather mild compared to others, but I shall try harder to make my post meaningful.<br>
<br>
You and I can banter back and forth but it will lead to nowhere.   I'm sorry that you were so offended by my opinions and comments, I already said that my post regarding the ADD/Radiant thread was NOT intended to cast stones on your guild, but you chose not to accept that.  You threatened me, maybe if I was less argumentative I could allow it to slide but I would rather defend myself.<br>
 <br>
I think you're an immature ranting idiot who can't handle criticism.  Can't take the flame...don't post the post.<br>
