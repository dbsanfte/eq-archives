<br>
1) If you don't want your intelligence or lack there of to be called into question - display a reading and cognitive ability somewhat above your average high school dropout. Perhaps flaming on a flame board and inviting unfavorable comparisons between yourself various simian species is not the best plan for you. Think it over, if your think I am not going to flame you back for being an idiot on a flame board... well you need to think again for a bit.<br>
<br>
2) The reference to me insulting rel in por - like I said - It wasn't me who came here and started this thread and it wasn't me who brought up vis (and lotus cult) and insulted us three times (so far). It was not me that repeatedly brought the topic back to that point. Hence your weak assertion that somehow my responding directly and in a timely fashion to a flame post directed at my guild, is bringing us back to the guild hate topic, is weak to say the least. That you cannot comprehend this simply astounds me. It probably shouldn't surprise me though - considering your defense of sirinab even after she was banned I suppose I should expect a certain lack of comprehension of reality from you.<br>
<br>
3) The thread is replete with examples of your ex-guildmate insulting various quellious guilds. Thankfully, though I may believe you are a complete moron, I do not label Rel in Por and other guildmates of yours as such. If you think its ok to call all of vis and Lotus 'rude,' imply that vis has a horrible rep without example, and (insert all the text from the third galliana whats his face post here - no need to quote the whole thing). I fail to see why you would be upset by me implying that perhaps you were dropped more than a few times on your head when you were young.<br>
<br>
4) Lastly, I think the record of what did and didn't happen in LH stands for itself. Its amusing that while I am guilded with many ex LH people and know many of them in RL, you are not - but of course you have the good memory right? Perhaps your projecting your own problems. While I consider you stupid, I never made any assertions about your popularity or lack there of. I will only supply one quote from you from your LH days to display your amazing cranial capacity:<br>

You were the one resorting to personal attacks.. who is the one lacking intelligence?'&gt;-<br>
-&lt;'2. Unless you saw something I didn't all I saw was an opinion from Galiana... There was no flaming Vis involved.. unless you have a different opinion of flaming.'&gt;-<br>
<br>
   Actually Gaelron you and your pal were the ones who started and then continued this flame. You don't have to look past the title of this thread to see that. Its pretty obvious that the planet your from operates under a somewhat different system of logic if your to stupid to see this. Of course there is the possibility that the you simply can't grasp the concept.<br>
<br>
-&lt;'..Sirinab was a person I'd consider a good friend.. thats why I came here defending her cause everyone was blown totally out of proportion when it came to her. Was she perfect? no Was she the monster everyone made her out to be? no'&gt;-<br>
<br>
   Again the record speaks for itself - without redundantly quoting an entire series of flame threads I will just assert this - Sirinab was BANNED for being an assshole. That pretty much makes a mockery of everything you said in those threads and here. Am I surprised you defended her? No. If Charile Manson was in Rel in Por you would probably tell everyone hes a swell guy. Though defending your guildmates is an admirable thing - taking it to pathetic extremes such as this makes me wonder if you need your head examined.<br>
<br>
<br>
-&lt;'4. You really think it has to do with rep that im with Rel? I did change a class so its not like I was gonna join vis or LC with a lvl 45 wizard at the time. I chose Rel for many reasons.. After Descent fell apart I had a few choices I chose Rel cause I wanted to play a new class and I liked the ideals of the guild.. whats wrong with that? I still wave to my old guildmates when I see them and they wave back. It would be nice to raid with them again but I am perfectly happy with Rel.<br>
After LH I went to Descent and they had a large deposit of former LH.. Where did you go? Lost track of you after LH fell apart. Perhaps unguilded or in no name guild so people forgot how you were like? just an assumption of course.&gt;-'<br>
<br>
 Actually Gaelron as usual you have made one of these sensational jumps in illogic you are becoming famous for. I didn't bring rep into this - YOU - did. In addition I only mentioned the fact that while you are not guilded in with ex-lh people - I AM. of course the semi-literate 'gaelspeak' babble above doesn't relate to this - it goes off on some tangent about wizards and descent. I don't know a good way to measure subjective popularity with the old LH crowd and personally, that is simply not important to me. What is important though was your sweeping statement regarding such was FALSE as usual.<br>
<br>
Lastly - that quote was the exact words out of your mouth. I made some screenshots because I wanted to post them. Sure 30 mins later with half the guild publicly wondering in /gu if you have had a frontal lobotomy you weaseled around a bit but even then the point stood (and apparently still stands.)<br>

Hell your still trying to convince people that sirinab was really just missunderstood, and gee bannings just happen to missunderstood people all the time. Fair enough.<br>
<br>
 Pretty much everything else in your last post dodges the whole point so there isnt much I can say besides this - if you want to address the points raised cool. I will respond to em. If you want to just post over and over and assume that if your post count is higher that somehow you 'won' like I am sure you think you did with the sirinab thing - go for it - but unless you address the points - YOU - raised, such as the fact the somehow it was *me* that started this flame and that it was *me* that kept flaming guilds - your going to be talking to yourself.<br>

 I shouldnt have to goto this length anyway but I suppose I have to - These two quotes dont match up -<br>
<br>
----<br>
no you didnt start the flame and I never said you were flaming guilds..<br>
----<br>
<br>
----<br>
Galiana is no longer on this server.. do we really need to go into this guild hate again? so dont bring it up Fkin. <br>
----<br>
<br>
 Perhaps you can reconcile these statements - I cant. You werent being overt, but you sure as heck implied it  - And yes I remember you insisting on rolling on everything that dropped that said all all whether you needed it or not - not that this is particularly pertinent to what is at hand here.<br>

What IS rash is making statements that have no basis in fact or reality - you are becoming very good at this. Sorry but the word 'hate' is not in any of my posts. True, I characterize you as an ill-begotten, illiterate moron, who has problems with truth and logic, and I cite examples backing up my claim. Do I hate you? No - Pity is the word.<br>

I only replied when you specifically flamed me ( and yes I realize in your mind for whatever reason you probably dont consider it a flame ). It appears to me that your litimus test for deciding if something is a flame goes something like this - does this derogetory post discuss me or my friends? If so its a flame. If not its not a flame. We in either case agree you dont see galiana's various comments as a flame, we obviously differ there, fair enough.<br>

<br>
 The only one who has used the word 'hate' Gaelron is *you*.<br>
<br>
 You and your friend started and pursued this flame thread.<br>
<br>
 You contradict yourself every other sentance, you dont feel obligated to justify yourself, and you are not particularly bothered with staying within the bounds of a truthful discussion.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
 Two things are clear - <br>
<br>
1) Its obvious that you have had many bad experiences with people refering to you as less than bright in the past. Perhaps there is some truth in this or it wouldnt bother you so much. <br>
<br>
2) Throughout this thread you blame various people and various other things for your own problems. I am sorry, but I truely feel bad for you. Seek help you really need it. Your problems are of your own making not some other person.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
<br>
 No I dont particularly need lessons in flaming as such - I responded in a frank and forthright manner to all your posts, and I stand by every word. I honestly believe you are of diminished intelligence and perhaps have certain paranoid mental issues. Seek help now.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you truely want closure on this you wouldnt continue to flame. Frankly it doesnt really matter what your particular ludicrous definition of flame is. The fact is - any derogetory remark in this section constitutes a flame. If I were to replace every instance of vis or lotus cult in this thread with 'rel in por' I am sure you would be offended. The simple fact remains that because these remarks werent directed towards you, or because you agreed with them, for some twisted reason you beleive they arent flames. I am sorry you cannot comprehend this. Truely it doesn't take great feats of logic to understand.<br>
