<br>
Please try to keep it to flames and suggestions on the ideas and not the people if possible.<br>
<br>
I tried to outline two possible approaches to this spawn.  I want to continually edit this first post to include the feedback most tend to agree with.  After beating on this for a week or so, lets email our recommendation to Verant (and the server GM) on how we would change the quest.  An email could be signed “the Quellious sever” if a large majority agree.  Since a change may never happen, we also need to discuss how to deal fairly with the current quest implementation. <br>
<br>
Option A (the new Verant option):<br>
Three times a day (every day) a L58-60 wraith can spawn randomly in BW that has a 1-2% chance of dropping the container.  Up to 3-6 wraiths can be present at any given time.  This gives a guild the option of determining if the number up is worth changing previous plans for the day.  If your guild wants it bad enough they camp the zone for the weekend with maybe a 20% chance of getting an epic as long as no one else is hunting them.  In this case, it would truly be first come first served FFA due to the random zone loc pop and timers on the mobs.  A group that melee engages the mob first has priority to the mob<br>
<br>
Option B (the Player option):<br>
1.  All the clerics wanting Rage get there approx (6?) hr prior to spawn.<br>
2.  One of the clerics there does a zone shout every 15 min. indicating the countdown to a roll off at (4?) hr prior to spawn.<br>
3. All clerics wanting to roll for Rage must be able to get at least (3?) groups of (L50+? or L55+?) in the zone at (4?) hr prior to the anticipated spawn.<br>
4.  Only one set of (3?) groups can be associated with the roll for one specific cleric.<br>
3.  Roll off determines winner of the upcoming spawn.<br>
4.  The roll winner is the ONLY person that can loot the spawn irregardless of who kills it or how it is killed (to prevent the vulture mentality).  Hopefully, all players in the zone at spawn time will assist the winning cleric in killing the mob.<br>
5.  If the roll winner can’t get it done and the mob despawns then so be it.  Any spectators or other guilds present in the zone can not get priority for the spawn unless the winning cleric verbally passes rights to the spawn in a zone shout.<br>
<br>
Please post comments, suggestions, corrections, or alternate options.  Thank You!<br>

It's well meaning to want to create rules of conduct outside of the policies already set forth by VI, but VI will not support it. Things such as calendars, lists, how long you've been at a spawn, camp checks, claiming spawns, etc. do not exist when it comes to their decisions.  <br>
<br>
This is a reality check :P<br>
<br>
Guides and GMs use the Play Nice Policies to govern how players are expected to behave in game.  These are the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> things that will be looked at in terms of VI's final decision on arbitration.  I know we'd all like play according to our own rules we've set forth and agreed on, but VI will not support those player made rules since we're &quot;In Their World Now&quot;.<br>
<br>
I think what would be more appropriate would be to look over the Play Nice Policies again and use them to guide our behavior.  Sure there are grey areas, but we should be able to reach agreement over any sort of issues that come before us in the future.<br>
<br>
After the Play Nice Policies, I've given an example of a potential Ragefire situation and how the Play Nice Policies can be used to our benefit rather than seen as a stumbling block or something we have to go around.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1.1 Play Nice Policies - Activity within EverQuest </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
In addition to the general guidelines listed in section 1.0, players are also subject to these supplementary rules while playing EverQuest. While by no means an all-inclusive list of the do's and don'ts in EverQuest, it provides a suitable foundation by which the player can determine what activities are appropriate: <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You may not steal kills.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group without that group's specific permission.  The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You may not ninjaloot.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.  The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same thing. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise. If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a binding compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by an EQCSR will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Note: A &quot;group&quot; in this case is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> capable</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of completing that goal.</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player or group of players. This includes things such as:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Monopolizing most or all of the kills in an area. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Deliberately blocking a doorway or narrow area so other players cannot get past. <br>
Refusing to cooperate with the other parties at a contested spawn site after having been instructed to do so by an EQCSR. <br>
Making excessive and inappropriate use of zone-wide communications (/shout, /ooc, /auction). <br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Ragefire example:<br>
<br>
1) Player-devised Compromise: Ragefire (the human) spawns.  Two or more groups wish to kill him.  The groups are required to compromise.  Both groups/parties are under the definition of &quot;group&quot; (united in a common belief/goal and capable of completing it).  So, one of the grey areas within these policies is the term &quot;capable&quot;.  Deeming who is capable in completing the goal (killing Ragefire) and who is not, is arbitrary since it is based upon opinion.  The word moot comes to mind.  There is no pre-determined minimum amount of players necessary to kill Ragefire.  Example: It could take one group to six groups or more to kill him.  Therefore, each spawn situation is independent.  There is no carry-over to other future spawns.  All players present at the time of spawning should be included in the compromise.  Such compromises can be reached via /random or various other compromises in which <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> parties are in agreement. <br>
<br>
If a player-devised compromise cannot be met with all parties present...<br>
<br>
2) VI Compromise: An EQCSR should be contacted to mandate a binding compromise.  All players must abide by this agreement or face disciplinary action witnessed by the EQCSR.<br>
<br>
These are not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> my</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> opinions, but they are the actual rules which we abide by when playing this game.  We agree to them each and every time we log on.  I'm not brown-nosing VI either.  I'm just stating policies and trying to reach an understanding so that we may utilize them to our benefit, as they were put in place for that exact reason.<br>
<br>
We may not all agree on the rules, but they are what we have to work with.  We have an opportunity to reach compromises of our own device, but if they cannot be met then we have an independent third-party (VI) who can step in and assist us.  My feeling on contacting an EQCSR isn't to get somebody in trouble, or to give myself an advantage, but to get somebody not involved into the decision-making process.<br>
<br>
Last note, no matter how much we may dislike the rules and how many ideas we have to improve upon them, VI will not change them at this point in time. No matter how many players or servers agree on such things as lists, calenders, camp claimings, etc, they have written a firm rule which is pretty much set in stone.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps us, for in the future we will be faced with many more Ragefires and similar situations may happen.<br>

= = = = = = <br>
I can’t disagree with anything you said and they are good points.  Is there any way to modify option B to take into account the potential for despawning mobs?  Maybe the second place finisher from the roll is on standby for the mob if first group fails or gives up rights to spawn?  Most the time I would think the winning cleric would see that they have no chance before the human trigger kill and give the zone shout that they can’t handle it and mob is free for others (or better yet, pass to cleric #2).<br>
<br>
The intent behind allowing someone the mob (even if it would despawn) would be to encourage everyone in the zone to help instead of having several groups standing back cheering for the mob and hoping for a wipeout so they might have a chance for the mob.  Several guilds that have a person staying to help could call in others from their guild and essentially build up a force that would not lose.  Since you have a pre-defined person with spawn rights they will be able to take their time on setup and probably know before they kill the trigger whether they can handle the dragon or not.  If they don’t have the force for the dragon then they don’t kill the human form and it passes to cleric # 2 to try and get a capable force set up.  <br>
<br>
As far as enforcement, you are right that Verant is not going to look to a server rule over their overall rules.  The best you can hope for is that most folks on the server would respect the local rule and a majority of the time it would work out.  If a guild on the server wants to come in and do as they please, you can’t prevent that as long as it fits within VI’s guidelines.  The big question is whether a large majority of guilds on the server would respect a server-defined guideline or not.  I would hope (maybe unrealistically) that we as a community could come up with a better solution to this spawn than Verant’s ‘one size fits all’ rules guidelines.<br>
<br>

Great feedback and thanks for taking the time to give a thoughtful response.<br>
<br>
VI’s rules state that “It is strongly suggested that groups make every attempt possible to reach a compromise they can live with prior to involving EQCSR”.  I think this is what we are trying to do with a predefined and server known way of handling the spawn.  If predefined, then at least folks are not trying to negotiate some way to determine who has the spawn between many different groups who all think they are right.  At the spur of the moment and with several groups, it can be extremely difficult.<br>
<br>
Often, there is no GM or guide available to arbitrate so where do you go from there if each of the four different groups there think they should go first (or are the only one with capable force on the way)?  If one of the 4 groups wins a roll, will there be 3 groups in a free for all if they fail?  Does it default to second highest roller or a new roll with everyone who is now in the zone?  <br>
<br>
I guess these are some of the things it would be nice to determine in a general server guideline to aid discussion and negotiation during the heat of the moment at the spawn.  And yeah I know I am crazy and foolish for attempting the impossible. Can't hurt to give it a try tho.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

5. If the roll winner can’t kill the dragon in the first melee attempt (or cannot obtain sufficient force to kill the dragon), the human trigger/dragon passes to the next highest roller.<br>

Pros- Eliminates the potential for despawn.  To further eliminate that potential, only one attempt could be allowed for the roll winner.<br>

If a spawn is contested the opposing sides random, winner gets first shot, if they fail then the next contestant is up.  But you have to throw in, what if one group shows up in force and there is one loan cleric asking to random, according to the rules it the group with sufficient force that gets to try.<br>
<br>
My opinion is you need to concentrate on punishment.  The VI rules are very constraining and the enforcement depends on what is &quot;witnessed by GM or Guide&quot;.  If you want people to play nice on the server then it's time to show them what happens when you or your guild does not &quot;play nice&quot;.<br>
<br>
Are we willing to excommunicate guilds or players?  For example if a guild ninja loots or kill steals something whether or not VI hands down some sort of punishment is the rest of the server population willing to really stick it to the offender.  Suspension is 2 weeks, are willing stop buying items at the bazaar from certain guilds, stop grouping with them, stop ressing, porting, etc.  What happens if you have a friend in that guild are you willing to shun them as well?<br>
<br>
Who is to be the judge?  Are you going to have a court saying X person was right and X person was wrong or just wait for a GM to make that decisioin?<br>
<br>
I know we all want solutions, and it's not even just about Ragefire.  It's about me sitting in EC watching the spam bazaar and people arguing over Orc 1 to the point they need to call GM to arbitrate.<br>
<br>
I don't want to just get to the point where we just throw up our hands and say we give up, but it starts with you.  Yeah sound corny.  But that is how things will get better, when you are willing to back down as a guild or person when something is contested.  That you take the high road and say sure this person might have kill stealed or jumped a spawn or whatever, I'm not going to do that to someone else.  If somoene does wrong and it's clear and cut, they are pariah in my eyes, I won't port, res, or shop from them or people associated with them.  All moralistic crap, but I still believe this is the only way things will get better.<br>
<br>
Anywya, sorry my feedback was not more positive, I'm willing to listen and my guild is willing to follow whatever the server decides just as we did before, but we don't want to be the ones following the rules and when some breaks those rules there better be action just besides us treating a guild as leppers.<br>

The current rules don’t give any guidance for that and this is attempt to figure out something fair for everyone.  Who can say that a cleric arriving 10 min before the pop with 6 groups doesn’t have a right to the spawn as much as the 10 people who negotiated for it an hour earlier?  This is particularly tough for a spawn that can happen over a wide range of times.  It is further complicated by the fact that a ton of folks are lined up waiting to get it.<br>
<br>
How would Verant’s current rules apply to this situation?:<br>
1. Ten clerics are in SF waiting for the random pop and those 10 can’t all agree on who should get first shot on Ragefire.  If they do somehow agree, then another 10 clerics long into the zone over the next 2 hrs. and voids any previous negotiation that took place.<br>
2.  Trigger pops and 10 guilds or groups start porting to SF to aid their clerics.<br>
3.  Guild A activates the trigger and starts to pull dragon to their forces.<br>
4.  Guild A decides to kite dragon for 10 min to allow a few more folks to port in.<br>
5.  Under Verant rules, do folks give guild A time to kite cause this is a triggered mob or do Guilds B, C, D, and E see that the dragon is not being actively pulled to a kill force and are ready to pull to their team now? <br>
6.  Guild B takes the kiting aggro away from A cause they are set up with capable force and ready to kill it right now.<br>
7.  Of course guilds C, D, and E were also ready and instead rush the mob with their forces while their pullers ping pong the aggro.<br>
8.  Lets say guilds C, D, and E all engage at about the same time with guild C about 5 seconds before D or E.<br>
9.  Guild D gets the actual kill.<br>
<br>
OK, under Verant rules, who is entitled to the loot and will a GM be able to identify the right winner based on logs after the fact?  What if guild A, B, or C had got the kill?- should that make any difference in who had the priority to kill the mob?  Would the GMs decision on who owns the loot be different depending on who got the actual kill?<br>
<br>
I guess this tread is an attempt to see if anyone wants to try and have discussion on finding a proactive alternative to the many different types of variations of the scenario outlined above.<br>
<br>
OK, I am going to shut up for a while and see if anyone sees any value in continuing this or not.<br>

If my guild is ready to go in and get ragefire ( we have 2 people rdy for it now) we walk into skyfire and there is another force there hmm what do we do ? Leave of course why fight over a spawn, hell it spawns every 24 hrs now.  To make this spawn work for everyone the way it is set up we actually just have to respect each other .. and everyone will get their turn ...but I dont think one cleric in the zone camping it is gonna do it ...I think what is gonna have to be done is if you want ragefire you will have to camp it in force for the whole 24hrs waiting for it to spawn.  There is some good points to it though ... you can farm spells in this area ... most creatures are blue to a 60 so you can get exp in this area .. its not like its gonna be a boring 24hrs while waiting for the spawn ... so if a guild can get 3 groups in there to camp it 24hrs why shouldnt that guild be respected and left alone to get their turn ?  As long as they are calling the camp and have the force there. <br>
<br>
Verrant made this camp very very hard for clerics only if we let disrespect and greed govern it ...it does not have to be this way.  I know my guild will respect any other guild camping Rage in the case of them calling the camp and having sufficient force there to kill the dragon.  I would hope others would respect us when its our turn <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>

<br>
This is where the subjectiveness comes into play and why this whole mess came into existence.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  sufficient force </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Would you turn around and walk out if your &quot;sufficient force&quot; had walked in Sky Fire and a cleric was there on his own claiming camp?  Or would you stick around and soak up the experience for the day with your &quot;sufficient force&quot; just in case?  And in the case that the human form would pop.. would you wait for the one cleric that was claiming the spawn in ooc to gather his &quot;sufficient force&quot;?  Aaaah.. the dilema.  And if you are that kind.. how much time would you give him and what is your definition of a &quot;sufficient force&quot;?<br>
<br>
The spawn has turned into one that can not be camped by a adventurer and a couple of his devoted friends to keep him company anymore.  And if you do indeed camp it.. be prepared to lose the camp to the faster and stronger more sufficient force.  And have just a bit of relief knowing that you don't lose your epic piece anymore.<br>
<br>
Now more directed to what is at hand.  When the GM makes his/her decision... I do hope that each side will stand up for the other if suspension may play a part.<br>
<br>
It would be nice if GMs would make a decision then ask the party that was on the favorable side of the dispute if they would like to press charges so to speak.<br>

For 3-6 days, 3-4 groups of ppl will &quot;camp&quot; the spawn for the lucky cleric?  To all you clerics that have completed the Ragefire quest, how hard was it to get 1 group of ppl to stay with you, much less 3-4 for 3-6 days?  That is unrealistic.  Smaller guilds like my friend Kaaelin's Fellowship of th Phoenix will have very little chance at this mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

As far as it being unacceptable to see the mob despawn, if it's not your turn, don't worry about it unless you are gracious enough to help.  Give ppl their chance and let them lose the spawn on their own instead of contesting the rights to it...they can't &quot;blame&quot; anyone but themselves if they don't get it.<br>
<br>
And in the end, who would govern the rulings we all agree on?

<br>
I had a long talk with our server GM (Xeik) about it while I was sitting at the Rage spawn in Skyfire.  Here are a few of the things I learned GM's will consider if the situation is contested.<br>
<br>
1) This camp can be &quot;claimed.&quot;  That is to say, one force given rights to first kill attempt and thereby, rights to the loot if successful.  But it order for it to be claimed, the cleric must have a killing force present during the camp.  If the force dwindles, the cleric will be given a brief period to replenish the force by whatever means within their sphere of influence.  If the force cannot be replenished or the cleric leaves the zone for a reasonable amount of time, the claim is lost.<br>
<br>
2) A single cleric at the camp has no legitimate claim rights as described in #1.<br>
<br>
3) If multiple single clerics are contending for the camp and Ragefire spawns, whichever one who engages Ragefire with killing force first has rights to the kill.  (This is effectively a race to get your people in the zone, to the spawn.)<br>
<br>
4) Kiting does not count as killing force engagement and thus gives no right to the kill.<br>
<br>
5) If one force fails their attempt, they lose their claim and any killing force standing by is entitled to attempt the kill.  If multiple killing forces are standing by, it would be FCFS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Those are the rules the GM's consider when making an arbitration about contention in this spawn, unless Xeik gave me incorrect information.  He also told me him and other server GM's are trying to get this quest changed yet again because of the contention problems.  In the meantime they are working on official rules that can be posted on the official webpage.<br>

<br>
thanks for the info from Xeik... <br>
<br>
Most of it is clear.  There is the one sticky definition that remains - perhaps we can get that cleared up and get this nailed down.<br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;5) If one force fails their attempt, they lose their claim and any killing force standing by is entitled to attempt the kill. If multiple killing forces are standing by, it would be FCFS.&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
What is &quot;fail&quot;?  Is it merely the reduction of your killing force to the point that the kill is not possibile (only feigners or offline rezzers left alive, no one dealing damage)?   Does &quot;failure&quot; only come when the attackers cry &quot;Uncle&quot; and leave?<br>
<br>
Once you have this definition, then the other gray areas, I think, are resolved.   I mean, Sufficient Force becomes that force that does not fail.   If you think you have enough and you're first - go for it... if you &quot;fail&quot; it goes to the next crew in line.<br>

Kataar, <br>
Any solution that requires coding by Verant will have to wait for Verant to do it.. I dont beleive in the current environment one will get the parties to agree (and live up to) to a guild, race, religion, or whatever rotation, or a queue of clerics to do this quest.  Too many have gotten the taste of FFA, and no one has the capabilities or stomach for enforcement that such an agreement will require.<br>

<br>
The only way Verant’s shoddy rules can come into play is if there is a dispute petitioned to the GM.  I think player rules could work if a majority of guilds would take a stand to support them and enforce them among themselves.  That could be a very tall order tho. <br>
<br>
I think Opalmoon hit the nail on the head with a fair way of deciding priority for the spawn, at least for raiding groups.  If a cleric has at least 3 groups of L50+ players in SF, then they have the priority until they leave.  If you really want the spawn then you and your friends should be there in the zone in force to support that fact.  Any other groups that come into zone are in the priority cue (based on when they got there) for when the first group leaves.  (Lets just hope that any players who want to force a roll thru Verant rules lose if they press the issue.)  If you do the time, you should get a crack at the mob.  <br>
<br>
Anyone who sits with a tracker in zone and tries to flood the zone at spawn is nuts and should give a serious look at some of those nice single player games out on the market now.  Same thing for anyone in the zone or zoning in that would attack the trigger before the rightful group (tho they can per Verant’s rules).  Imho, I think the first cleric should have priority until they pass that priority to the zone (tho Verant’s rules may not allow that either).  Call me nuts and unrealistic, but any kind of server rule/precedent should encourage cooperation.  Verant’s rules promote confrontation and confusion.<br>
<br>
The biggest gap still applies to the most common situation and that is no one having 3 groups in zone.  Many clerics are camping there, others just logging on, and others logging in and out.  Guess I don’t have much more to say about that than I already have.  I honestly think the quest design needs to change to a format that eliminates Verant’s rules as much as possible. <br>
<br>
Good luck and safe travels<br>

In GM # 5, if the first attempt fails, but no one else engages the mob while the first triggering group recovers, can the first group re-engage when ready or do they have to wait on anyone else who wants to take a turn before taking another shot?<br>
<br>
Also, does the triggering aspect completely disappear as soon as the first group dis-engages or is that still a consideration if they are ready to re-engage and the dragon has not been engaged by another group yet? <br>

<br>
<br>
Q) In GM # 5, if the first attempt fails, but no one else engages the mob while the first triggering group recovers, can the first group re-engage when ready or do they have to wait on anyone else who wants to take a turn before taking another shot?<br>
<br>
A.) If the first force is recooperated, ready, and able to kill and the second one is not completely or very nearly ready (like 5-10 mins from away from readiness) then yes, they may go again.  If the second force is completely ready and able to kill (in which case they probably would have immediately engaged it upon the disengagement of the first force), then no, the first force must wait their turn (and they probably won't get one, but you never know).<br>
<br>
Q.) Also, does the triggering aspect completely disappear as soon as the first group dis-engages or is that still a consideration if they are ready to re-engage and the dragon has not been engaged by another group yet?&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
A.) I'm not sure what triggering aspect you're talking about.  The skyfire spawn requires no trigger component so in failure, nothing is lost item-wise.<br>
<br>
Q.) What is &quot;fail&quot;? Is it merely the reduction of your killing force to the point that the kill is not possibile (only feigners or offline rezzers left alive, no one dealing damage)? Does &quot;failure&quot; only come when the attackers cry &quot;Uncle&quot; and leave?&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
A.) It would be the first case.  Failure means the mob is disengaged.  For example, if all that's left is feigners, camped out clerics, and a bard or druid kiting around Ragefire (remember kiting does not count as engagement) til the force can recoop, they have failed and their turn is over.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.<br>

<br>
Try playing a Warrior or Mage.<br>
<br>
You have one of the easiest Epics out there.  <br>
<br>
1. The vast majority of it can be soloed<br>
2. The Priest drops to a single group<br>
3. Ixxy is an easily triggered mob (tough bastid, but easily done if you have half a clue)<br>
4. The King is not bad at all cause he's right near Warr, Necro, and Chanter Epic drops (so raids are easy to setup)<br>
5. All of your harder event mobs ALWAYS drop your piece (so you'll never have to repeatedly farm a mob (YOU try getting a group to kill Phinny for the 20th+ time when he keeps refusing to drop your Bard, Mage, Rogue, or Wizzie piece).<br>
<br>
Cmon folks... time to take a really tall glass of STFU here, cause honestly, this cleric crap is getting old.  You whined that Rage should be moved.  Verant moved it.  Now he's another Venril Sathir, in that the fastest team to get to him, gets their shot at him (regardless of how many hours a cleric sits around waiting for him to spawn).<br>
<br>
The answer here is to just get over it.  The biggest, fastest guilds are going to own Rage for a while... and the rest will just have wait til they're done.  Anyone remember when Vis, LC, etc basically owned the Venril Sathir mobs?  Eventually they moved on.  The same will hold true with Rage.  Sure, it'd be nice to share... but that is not the Verant way.  Clerics had it easy with Rage (out of the way location, and very few issues when you really look at it), but they werent content with that.  Well... I hope yer happy now. <p><center>

<br>
Thanks a ton for taking the time to post some of the clarifying comments from the GM.  We all appreciate that very much!<br>
<br>
One of the keys here is that Rage is “claimable” for a cleric who is in the zone with the necessary forces prior to the spawn.  The FCFS race is eliminated if that condition is met.<br>
<br>
As far as the ‘trigger’ is concerned- A group triggers the fight by handing in the pearl (which is now returned, not lost) and also triggers the dragon by killing the human form.  If the triggering group decides to kite for a few minutes to heal up from the human fight (and allow for a few more reinforcements), do they lose priority on the dragon because they have disengaged even tho they have capable force in zone?  I assume they retain priority since they have not yet “failed their attempt” and another group cannot attempt to engage even tho the mob is not being actively pulled to a killing force.  This makes this situation different from a non-triggered one like Lodi or VS. <br>
<br>
It sounds like the triggering group loses priority only when the capable force condition is not met.  If the capable force condition is lost and then restored by the triggering group and the mob has not been engaged yet, then what now?  Based on the GM comments, I assume that any aspect of being the triggering force (ie: ability to kite unmolested) has disappeared and the dragon is now considered a ‘regular’ mob (FCFS unless it’s being actively pulled to a capable force).  I assume this is now the case because the cleric cannot lose the quest piece and ‘trigger’ in the full literal sense of the rules does not apply anymore to the spawn.<br>
<br>
Like it or not, if you play by what is allowable under the rules, it encourages people to hold back their help and hope their fellow players get wiped out.  Verant rules are currently set up to foster a medieval style of “Might is right” mentality.  Seems like the GMs recognize this is a problem for an epic quest item and are working to change the quest to a different format.<br>

<br>
The Sol B Ragefire is the one you hand the pearl into and from which you receive a new pearl in return.  Handing in that pearl has absolutely no correlation with Ragefire spawning in Skyfire.<br>
<br>
Skyfire Rage spawns in a static location and does not wander.  He spawns in human form KOS to all.  When he is killed, the dragon spawns.<br>
<br>
The dragon drops a heart container with 2 slots in which you combine the new pearl to fashion the Heart of Ragefire to be handed to Omat.<br>
<br>
Hope that clears the triggering point up.<br>

I assumed, incorrectly, that the pearl was still given to the human form prior to killing him and triggering the dragon spawn.  Makes sense, why give an item whose only intent would be to turn him kos since they changed to quest to eliminate the potential loss of the pearl.  That aspect didn’t really do anything to affect the arguments of priority anyway.<br>
