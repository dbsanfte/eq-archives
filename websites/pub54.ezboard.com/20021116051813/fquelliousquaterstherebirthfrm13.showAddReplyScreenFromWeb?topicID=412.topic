<br>
I hadn't planned on posting here any more, but in order to clarify a few things, I will so you can move on to other things.  Hopefully, this will lay it all to rest.<br>
<br>
Why I left has nothing to do with me being female.  It really has nothing to do with most of the comments made about females.  I thought the comment about &quot;I don't trust anything that bleeds for five days and doesn't die&quot; was a little disgusting and said so.  Personally, in trying to read back through some threads and figure out where I got off on the wrong foot here, that was where I should have kept my mouth shut.  You proclaim this to be a board where everyone is free to express their opinion, but it isn't.  They are free to express their opinion if they are part of the in crowd.  All others may go someplace and die please.<br>
<br>
I thought I was being a little paranoid, but after having some people ask me in game what I did to tick everyone off so bad here, I realized I wasn't the only one with that perception.  Yes, I know, I'm just too sensitive. (that was a sarcastic remark about myself just for clarificiation)  I was also told ahead of time that the clique had decided I was out and they were not going to let up.  I laughed it off, but they were right.  I'm sure you who are involved don't think you have a mob mentality, but you do and it's very plain to those who are not on the inside looking out.  To be honest, I think you really should make this a closed forum since it really is a private little haven for a select few or at least close it to posts except the chosen ones so others can read, but not invade your private sanctuary.<br>
<br>
I was told several times, not just four, I was too sensitive and didn't know how to take a joke.  I have read back through many threads and have seen the elite group totally hammer on someone (male and female) for often minor things.  The difference is that they are not part of your in group.  Many of these so-called jokes are just nasty, petty slashings which I suppose you use to vent frustration or exert your virtual muscles or whatever and the little smileys weren't used, but everyone knows you were just joking.  I don't think I was ever demeaning or mean to anyone in any of my comments.  Admittedly, I have a dry sense of humor so many of you may not get it or appreciate it, but I have never been hateful to anyone.<br>
<br>
The reason I left was I was tired of getting some derogatory comment every single time I posted.  The pack had decided I was not welcome and therefore you looked for something to pick at every time I posted.  I was invited to leave more than once so I did.<br>
<br>
And, if you don't think there is a pack mentality here take a look at some of the threads.  The kid who complained about being ks'd.  I can't remember the thread and have looked, but don't have time to continue the search.  At any rate there were three people who commented on that actual subject and everyone else in the pack sliced him to ribbons because of his writing ability.  Of course, it was the elites doing it so everyone knows they were just joking.  (I didn't notice anyone complaining that the thread had changed from a game complaint to a lesson in English, but perhaps that's because it just all depends on who's jacking the thread.  Personally, I don't know what the big deal is anyway.  In the writer's forum the moderators just switch thread headings and everyone goes on about their business.  A few jokes are made about it, but no one seems to have heart failure and flames endlessly about it.)<br>
<br>
Someone recently posted an invitation to come to ec for a party since they were leaving the game.  He evidently posted the wrong date and once again we are off and running.  Not one person said I'm sorry you're leaving.  Not one person said thanks for the invite.  Every post except one, merely commented on the date.  The one who didn't comment on the date said something to the effect of like &quot;who gives a **** if you're leaving, just go and die already.&quot;<br>
<br>
Parenting is a sensitive issue?  I shouldn't have brought it up?  Well, actually my comment was that I thought it was a good idea not to give passwords to anyone with the caveat that I had my son's and he had mine and I added, in what I thought was a light-hearted manner, but evidently was not, that there is no privacy in this house.  Everyone seemed to miss the part where I said he had my passwords to my computer and game also, they just jumped on me because I am a sicko obesessive b**** or words to that effect.  I should have changed the thread then, but didn't realize that was also a sensitve subject.  You really should post a list of sensitive subjects so the people who are new here don't cross the line.  (That was meant as a joke, but might actually be a good idea.)<br>
<br>
Since this is my thread and this pertains to how I feel this forum has gone, I'm not changing the thread.  Let me give you the rest of the story as to why the neighborhood kids come to my house to hang out and why we try to make this a haven for my son's friends here.  AND, why I am very involved in what my youngest son does.  My middle son absolutley hated it when we moved from the country to town.  Some friends of ours worked for a large ranching family and said they could get him a job on the ranch.  I didn't like him being away from home, but the ranchers paid him to work, he was going to high school and getting good grades and, above all, he was happy as a lark and the cowboys liked him.  The family quit after about a year so middle son moves back to town.  Before long he's running with some kids I totally do not like and within a short time they are joy riding.  There were 8 involved and they cut 6 of them loose in exchange for testimony.  The seventh was given a reduced sentence in exchange for testimony and mine got sent to prison for 6 years because, as the prosecutor told me, he was going to make an example out of him to the others about not cooperating.  I'm very good friends with many of the deputies and officers so I asked one why mine got the brunt of it and she told me he had never been in trouble and they didn't know if they'd get him again but they knew they would have the others within 6 months on something else.  Aside from that, he refused to name anyone else and they weren't happy about that.<br>
<br>
Long story short, I know too late now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       Regardless of how hard a parent tries, some things just don't work out.  He's out now and married with two beautiful little boys and trying to get his life right.  So, some people do change.  However, I will continue to be very involved in youngest son's life, not so I can flex my parental muscle, but so I can be there for him.  We do run a tight ship here.  He doesn't roam the malls or the streets at all hours of the night.  He does report in.  My oldest still calls when he is off at a rodeo to let me know how he did and that he's okay.  Not because I am an obsessive mother who can't let go, but out of respect for me.  He's nearly died three times in rodeo accidents, so he knows I worry.  The way I parent isn't for everyone.  It isn't the only way.  It isn't even the successful way or I wouldn't have had a kid turn 18 on his way to prison.  It's just the only way I know to do what is the most important job in my life and I won't apologize for what I do in that respect.<br>
<br>
This subject is also why I don't really think the endless jokes about prison rape are too amusing, but that again was laid off to me being too sensitive.  You spend three years constantly worrying about your child being gang raped because he doesn't belong to the right prison gang, doesn't pay off the right people, isn't the right race (white is not the right race in prison for those of you who are wondering) or doesn't learn how to fight well enough to gain the proper amount of respect.  You correspond with an 18-year-old kid for several months who is in on drug charges and then get a letter from a friend of his that he has been gang raped several times and the kid is trying to figure out how to kill himself, can you contact someone to try and help him before he succeeds.  Go through those things and then see how amusing it is about someone getting their poop chute raped.  I didn't attack anyone over those myriad comments about that, I merely said it wasn't really a joke. <br>
<br>
I've already heard all the rude comments about how he deserved everything he got.  If I was smart I wouldn't let him come home when he got out because everyone gets raped in prison and he'll have aids and give it to the whole family.  I've already heard all the comments about how could I screw up so bad to raise a kid like that.  Beleive me, there is no cutting remark you can make that I haven't already heard so you don't need to waste your time posting them here. <br>
<br>
You tell me parenting is a sensitive issue to some people here so we don't do that.  Well, beleive it or not, we all have sensitive issues and we don't all try to hound soemone to death over them.  <br>
<br>
The reason I left is not because of the jokes about women.  I thought a great many of them were quite funny and Sem often makes me laugh with his posts.  The joke about the third grade redhead, brunette and blonde was hilarious.  I shared that with family.  The guy with the pumpkin was  rofl time.  Just because I didn't comment on each one, doesn't mean I didn't think they were funny.  My children and their friends make fun of me constantly.  This house is the greatest repository of short jokes, klutz jokes and female jokes on earth (since I am the only female).  We do tend to keep it on the clean side, but that is our personal preference.<br>
<br>
The reason I left is because the pack mentality does bother me.  I got off on the wrong foot with the powers that be and the in crowd and it simply didn't matter what I said, you were going to find something to complain about.<br>
<br>
This board could be a very good thing.  I like keeping up with some of the things that are going on, such as the info on who is changing names etc and Obsidienx, just because I had hoped she was gone permanently.  We need to have a central meeting place for everyone and not just guild mates or a certain crowd. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, unless a person is part of the in crowd, it appears they had better kiss up if they expect to post much here without being shredded.  <br>
<br>
I play this game to relax.  Having to constantly wonder how someone is going to twist my words to find something to get offended about is not relaxing.  Therefore, it's just much easier for me to stick to Writer's Forum, Vinceremo and Healer's United and not have to carefully weigh my words or risk another attack that leaves me shaking my head and saying &quot;Huh?  What are they talking about?&quot;.<br>
<br>
The only reason I have posted this is to lay the whole thing to bed.  I'm gone so it really doesn't matter any more does it?  <br>
<br>
I appreciate Dahlea's support, but it doesn't matter.  You can all move on to something else now as I'm sure she has other things to do besides respond to pointless debates about why I left and my sensitivity.<br>
<br>
I sincerely hope the moderators will lock this thread.  It's just my opinion.  It doesn't need to be responded to.  It really is a dead issue.  There simply has to be something interesting going on.<br>

<br>
And in all honesty I do not understand the objective.  <br>
<br>
Packs ? I wouldn't say I was part of the 'pack' whatever that may be.   Is this crucifying someone for something they did ?  <br>
in EQ it maybe a little OTT, but there again it maybe retribution for what's been done.  <br>
<br>
I am talking about people like Obsidianx, which by your own admission you found interesting.  In this instance, would you not consider yourself part of the 'pack' even though you may or may not have commented.  <br>
<br>
Then you go on to say talk about children etc and jail.  Sorry, hell that's life. Some have it easy, some do not.  I do not consider myself to have had an easy life at all - but there again I would not cry over the past, I would only consider moving forward.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry for your situation, but your own path has been carved by yourself.  Granted its not always entirely in your control, but in the same breath I would not expect anyone to be sorry for me either.  <br>
<br>
Then you go on about some guy in prison, your son ???? again he chose his own path.  You can guide your children, but you cannot force them down a path.   Irrespective of how much you try and influence (brainwash/influence - I dunno) you again have no control over his situation.  <br>
<br>
From the sound of it, you don't need EQ ... you need to be with your family and friends.<br>
<br>
P.S. I have no real clue if this post is serious or not, it tends to go on a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utalasarfearghus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Talasar Fearghus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/23/02 12:28:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=412.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why Jynn Left</span><hr size=1> Raluvin,<br>

Everything Jynn posted here is explaining something that she had posted before and since deleted that she was either flamed about or whatever other reason she decided to delete them.  I think if you had actually been able to or had read the posts that are now gone, you would understand this one alot better.  It all is relevant and makes sense having that background.  It's a point of view, not a discussion, read it for what it is.  Someone putting their feelings on the table because they felt the board is biased towards a specific group of people, not a board that is &quot;The official Quellious Server&quot; board.  That is the group she is talking about, no one in game. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>

<br>
I assure you I am not looking for symapthy in real life or in this game or on this board.  I relate the prison incident for  three reasons.  Number one, some people seem to think I view myself a super parent and am trying to put down others.  I'm not.  I have been a miserable failure in many respects and if I came off sounding superior, I apologize for that.  Two, if I keep a close eye on the third child it isn't because I'm obsessed, it's because I know exactly how quickly things can go downhill.  Third the jokes about prison gang rape aren't amusing to me and now you know why.  BTW the context of the jokes wasn't about rapists, child molesters or drug czars, it was about Sendole and the rest of the twirps who are jacking accounts and running scams.<br>
<br>
Yes, I've made my own choices and so did my son and we live with them and learn from them and I am not crying in my beer about them.  It's over and done and we are all moving on.  I didn't say anything about the Gacy joke even though I probably had more cause to say something than most of you.  I'm really not that sensitive that I am constantly drudging up my past.  I am certainly not asking for anyone to feel sorry for me.<br>
<br>
Actually, I spend quite a lot of time with my family and friends.  The only way I can spend more is if I go to school or to his friend's house to spend the night with my son and he would probably frown on that.  That's why I have a job where I can work at home.  I also happen to play EQ with family and friends so quitting EQ really wouldn't make me any closer to any of them.  He's trying to get me to play Morrowind so the games aren't really an escape for us, just a form of entertainment.<br>
<br>
As far as me being in on the pack over Obsidienx, I've had dealings with her and will freely admit I don't like her or others of the same character.  I would hope there is a difference between the way I am perceived in the game and her.  I've worked pretty hard to present an honorable persona whereas I don't really think she cares about honor or scruples.<br>
<br>
As I said in the beginning.  I had hoped this post would lay any questions to rest so Dahlea can get off the hot seat.<br>

<br>
Yes Dahlea. Be warned. I'm going to turn on you next! (Great way to start an explanation, J.)<br>
<br>
&quot;They are free to express their opinion if they are part of the in crowd. All others may go someplace and die please.&quot;<br>
<br>
If conditions are so strict, I wonder why Ishan was burned outside the flame forum. After all, by some estimates, he should be part of the &quot;in crowd&quot; for being so callous. You're relatively new to QC Jynn. There <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   are</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> variables.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was also told ahead of time that the clique had decided I was out and they were not going to let up.&quot;<br>
<br>
I suppose the person relaying this message was part of the oppressed. Of course, the oppressed are gifted with prescience. You'll have to excuse me for not being sympathetic.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was told several times, not just four, I was too sensitive [snip]&quot;<br>
<br>
They got it partially right. The reason you rub others the wrong way is you're one of the few conservatives (or moderate conservative) in a liberal crowd. BTW, being aware of a thing is not the same as promoting it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you really should make this a closed forum since it really is a private little haven for a select few or at least close it to posts except the chosen ones so others can read, but not invade your private sanctuary.&quot;<br>
<br>
Could you *possibly* say anything more to paint regulars as fiends?<br>
<br>
&quot;The pack had decided I was not welcome and therefore you looked for something to pick at every time I posted.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wait, wait, wait!<br>
<br>
Get out of here Jynn!<br>
<br>
Okay, a pack member has verbally confirmed this hunch.<br>
<br>
&quot;And, if you don't think there is a pack mentality here take a look at some of the threads. The kid who complained about being ks'd. I can't remember the thread and have looked, but don't have time to continue the search.&quot;<br>
<br>
I didn't care for that thread, but then again I've also made fun of others for spelling/grammar. Charmi the most recent, but I doubt s/he walked away scared for life. If so, they're welcome to call me a grammar Nazi. Jynn, it sounds like you're taking up others' causes, entrenching yourself in their shoes. Appreciating how others feel is commendable but you (generic) can go too far.<br>
<br>
&quot;I didn't notice anyone complaining that the thread had changed from a game complaint to a lesson in English, but perhaps that's because it just all depends on who's jacking the thread.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think it had more to do with the fact that most didn't understand what the heck he was saying. His cause for posting never established itself in the minds of others, and the thread came off as an &quot;up for grabs&quot; deal.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the writer's forum the moderators just switch thread headings and everyone goes on about their business.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know when spammers/auctioners come here their posts/subject headings are liable to be changed. But I don't know what this comment is about.<br>
<br>
&quot;Someone recently posted an invitation to come to ec for a party since they were leaving the game. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   He evidently posted the wrong date and once again we are off and running.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
<br>
That would be me. If you want to label me a pack-member and think my goal was to snub a newcomer because I pointed out a human error in jest, what can I say but go ahead and label me a pack-member? I guess the &quot;in crowd&quot; is not the only one that can get it wrong, hm?<br>
<br>
BTW, I think I read the post here. It should be moved to the general forum. Oh sh*t, I'm being mean again.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not one person said I'm sorry you're leaving. Not one person said thanks for the invite.&quot;<br>
<br>
Esmalyn's guide to living happy: Do not, even quietly, impose your social expectations on others and you will not be disappointed. If you felt thanking them for the invite was the right thing to do, why didn't *you* set the example to the pack instead of holding us to your previously unknown standard? Like every human being you want to be accepted for who you are but you consciously sell yourself short by censuring what you allow others to see! Did these protective layers appear after your first injury here, or were they already forming on the advice of a friend who showed you to QC?<br>
<br>
&quot;...they just jumped on me because I am a sicko obsessive b**** or words to that effect.&quot;<br>
<br>
Chalk it up under &quot;not worth dwelling on.&quot; You wouldn't be the first one to see a stupid comment for what it is. Even if we disagree on what is good parenting, I'm sure you do your best. You should not feel compelled to explain yourself. BTW, if you post anywhere long enough you'll make a stupid comment too.<br>
<br>
&quot;Unfortunately, unless a person is part of the in crowd, it appears they had better kiss up if they expect to post much here without being shredded.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't remember kissing up to the mods. I do remember being crass, butting heads, and being a general bitch to anyone for anything. I remember criticizing Rave once, ragging on Gaethon (or is it Gay'than?) on the general forum, telling Gimily to @#%$ off in this forum, and some other assortments.<br>
<br>
I honestly tried taking your post seriously. I think in some aspects I did. But I can't do it on a whole because IMO, no one is taking as much time thinking about Jynn than Jynn herself.<br>

If the pack doesn't like what you, I, or anyone else posts, oh frikken well.<br>
<br>
I've made some wildly unpopular posts here. There are people that would rather delete a thread (had they the power to do so) than read my response (qed the thrashing of the Pledge argument between Fkin and myself). There are folks who will jump on my case for just seeing me post an opinion.<br>
<br>
Whatever.<br>
<br>
This is a flame board. Some people cannot understand the difference between a flame and pointless sniping, admittedly, but it is a place where folks come to vent, and they generally do so in a blatantly asinine manner. It is essentially the status quo hereabouts.<br>
<br>
Esmalyn is right, you are primarily getting grief because you are apparently a conservative. Join the club. I'm a fairly blatant Libertarian/Conservative as well, and catch hell for my opinions. Still, if my convictions cannot stand under the fire of the local harpies, they are not worth holding in the first place.<br>
<br>
I will not exhort you to stay as I think that you are perfectly correct in thinking that you don't &quot;fit&quot; here. I will say, however, that you can carve out a place should you desire it. It likely will not be worth the effort if you are not taking some sort of enjoyment from the bantering and bickering as it is though.<br>

As far as the whiners who gripe about posts being hijacked, get over it. It takes far less effort to post something to get it back on track than to bitch about starting a new thread. We have all done it to some extent, but the imprtant threads, unlike those that are just nonsensical flaming, usually make it back on track if anyone really cares enough to bother.<br>
<br>
I too am a conservative, and could give a @#%$ if anyone cares or not. I will continue to speak out when things are unfair, or if I have a really strong opinion. I find it a shame that a nice person such as Jynn felt the need to leave, but we all have to decide if we can be a part of this particular board community or not. I choose to stay as I enjoy the people here. Some impress me one day, and make me want to rip the power cord from my monitor the next.<br>
<br>
We will not all agree all the time on all things, and I hope that you may come back someday to visit us again Jynn.<br>

That's the way the cookie crumbles when your opinion is unpopular. If someone starts a personal flame expect to have flames of a personal nature directed at you. When the nature of the flame is more objective, expect others to disagree with you. I dunno.

&quot;Jynn, it sounds like you're taking up others' causes, entrenching yourself in their shoes. Appreciating how others feel is commendable but you (generic) can go too far.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, the reason for posting those two examples is so that people would not think that all I notice is &quot;me&quot; and point out that there is a pattern of jumping on really trivial things at times and it's not always trivial things that I do.  I understood the gist of his message, but apparently it was difficult for others.  The reason I didn't thank Barto for the invitation or say goodbye was I was a little weary at that point and didn't feel like opening another battlefront.<br>

&quot;BTW, I think I read the post here. It should be moved to the general forum. Oh sh*t, I'm being mean again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope, not at all.  Actually, I think this is the proper place because it will turn into a flame session and that saves someone else from having to move it later.  FWIW  I may not always agree with your point of view, but you at least set forth an intelligent and articulate one as opposed to a string of personal x-rated attacks.<br>

Thank you.  I count you as one of my new friends.  You remind me much of Snowbyrd.  Your personality suits your character well.<br>
<br>
I'll probably be posting some short stories on the Vinceremo board later.  I will take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in The Bard.  It started out as an introduction of Mynxx to Vinceremo and turned into a story.  Several people have encouraged me with the story so it is now being rewritten into a real novel sans the EQ aspects.  I can't finish the murder mystery until I go to Louisiana for some research, so this will be a pleasant diversion.  My sincere gratitude to you and the others for making me want to delve a little deeper into the fantasy.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Some impress me one day, and make me want to rip the power cord from my monitor the next.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmmm.  I know the feeling.  In reality, I find quite a few of the people here quite interesting.  There are some very witty people here.  I enjoy most of the things Sem passes along.  There are some intriguing personalities here.  <br>
<br>
&quot;They didnt slam her for having an opinion, they slamed her opinion.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't care if anyone slams me or my opinion.  What I do have an objection to is the attitude of some who feel they have to look for something to slam about whether it be opinion or person regardless of who it is. <br>
<br>
Be well all.  There's nothing to see.  Let's move along.  *Puts up police tape and closes the scene of the crime.*<br>

The ones that stick in my memory are your 2 page posts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
In fact I think you have only posted on about 3 different topics(not threads) so far, though some could be run together.<br>

However you screwed with a thread that directly involves good friends of mine and instead of banning you or whatever other drastic action people imply we do around here I made a joke out of it and you gave the appearance that you couldn't take that joke.  <br>
<br>
My point was don't take it personal, I screw with all kinds of people on this server.  If you do plan on taking it personal then just don't put yourself through it and leave.  I wasn't giving any kind of ultimatum to leave the board, I wasn't forcing you or anyone else not part of this supposed &quot;in&quot; crowd to leave, I simply made the suggestion that if you couldn't take it then take the most sensible approach and don't put yourself through it.<br>

Scared, maybe, and more than a little angry? That was just the point I was trying to make.<br>

At any rate, stay or go, it's your choice.
