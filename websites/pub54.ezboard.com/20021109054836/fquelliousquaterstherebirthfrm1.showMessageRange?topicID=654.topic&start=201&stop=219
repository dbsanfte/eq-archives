I also remembered seeing a post in reference to each cleric needing to support the previous cleric. I don't question the rule just going to cut and past the information and guidlines for our clerics to follow so we can also support the list that is being used. Anyones help on this matter is appreciated. Will be looking just posting in case some nice person knows where it is and can lead me in the right direction.<br>

Welp, personally I think the problem is Ragefire more than anything.<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree with Desi really, as I actually comprehend what he's saying.<br>
<br>
<br>
I also think the list is a great idea for folks who could not otherwise put the time in or compete for the mob.  <br>
<br>
Remember a month or two ago when you all said this wasn't gonna be like the Quellious Quarters reservation system?  Well, you were wrong.   It's exactly the same thing, with all the same benefits and flaws.   Remember YOU are locking up and dominating the rage spawn. YOU are telling everyone else what to do.  Yes, YOUR way cuts down the arguments, just as long as EVERYONE follows YOUR way.<br>
<br>
Wraith didn't step on or try to step on or intended to step on anyone.  We had a cleric that took time out to have a window where she could camp rage during a holiday weekend if she could get the camp open.  Faedorn kept it from beingn open, more power to him.  <br>
<br>
Your list is not authority, it's a collection of folks competing together for that spawn. If you have one cleric camping rage, and a non-list cleric comes in to take the next spawn and waits it out,  it's you guys running him over if your next cleric enters the zone and tells him to leave.<br>
<br>
This list monopolizing the spawn has no room to throw stones at anyone about playing a power trip or keeping anyone else down.  <br>

<br>
1.  The &quot;list&quot; is a group of clerics who are willing to put in the time to get their epic.  They are spending ungodly amounts of time in attaining their epic.<br>
<br>
2.  This is an in-game agreement between clerics.  Note here that I said &quot;clerics&quot;.  I didnt say LC, ADD, Wraith, bla bla bla.  I said &quot;clerics&quot;.  They made the list, and they are helping each other.  They are also policing the list, and their claims to Rage.<br>
<br>
3.  People are complaining about the size of the list.  Well... sure it sux... but I know of people who have been waiting over a year for a shot at Rage.  People are now being given the ability to get their spot in line, put in their time, and get their epic.  &quot;But I dont like the fact that I'm xx in line&quot;.  What do you propse?  FFA?  What does that accomplish?  I'll tell you what it accomplishes.  Rage pops, and 3-4 guilds rush in to tag him.  This has been the way of the past, and all it ended in was discord and ill will.  It was a dismal failure.<br>
<br>
4.  The list works.  People who are dedicated, and put in the time, get their epic.  People voice concerns about KSing guilds, Asian guilds, bla bla bla... yet they still dont see the beauty of this list.  I was party to 4 straight Rage takedowns for clerics in various guilds.  Within 10 minutes of Rage popping, there have been 50-60 people swarning into the zone to take him out.  These people have all been from a multitude of guilds, and have all come to help out the cleric 1st on the list.  This is almost impossible to KS.... cause the mobilization is simply that fast.  Additionally, the list gives all clerics the chance at Rage... even ones in the smaller Guilds.  And guess what?  It also give the medium guilds a great shot at Dragon Scales and CoFs.  Everyone wins.<br>
<br>
I guess the bottom line is the following...<br>
<br>
Have you noticed any arguments in the Flame Section about Rage being KSed lately?  No?  What about flames about ADD, Wraith, LC, etc (just examples btw) monopolizing Rage spawns?  No?<br>
<br>
Why is that?<br>
<br>
Seems to me that the list is working. <p><center>

It's actually worked out really well up till now,   and the only  problem is the length of the list, which is really part of the original issue (how hotly contested a mob this is), not the fault of the list. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

If someone wanted to get rid of the current system, one of the first steps they'd take would be to show how unfair the system is and establish moral high ground. When At Death's Door was first involved in the debate, they attempted the exact same thing. Eventually, though, Feadorn came around to seeing how this was good for everyone involved and bought in to the process. I'd like to think in part it was because he saw the passion people had for this and how much they believed in it.<br>
<br>
When I see Desi post, I see the exact same circumstance. A largish guild, with a cleric they want to get a click stick for, asking why they should wait their turn. If Wraith had no clerics that needed a Sprinkler then I wouldn't have that base distrust of their motives in questioning the system. But you do. And I am very passionate about this because I'm incredibly impressed that the clerics on my server would try something like this out, in the face of pressure from their guilds to just get the clicker and move on.<br>

I agree with you on that, but you went right for personal attacks.  <br>
<br>
Desi didn't make any criticisms of the system that it's own members haven't made.  Long list, whose authority, what about freeloaders, what about folks that don't hear about it and take out the time to camp ect ect...<br>
<br>
Most folks responded with &quot;I don't know but we're doing our best&quot;.  Which is a fair answer.  It's already being discussed about a way to keep the system from being a 50+ long monster wait, and how to adapt as it settles in and gains noteriety on the server.  I know firsthand what it's like trying to run, keep track of, and mediate this kind of thing, and you guys are doing a great job.  <br>
<br>
It's not about 'getting rid of the system'.  It's about WHY should &lt;insert latest cleric here&gt; be compelled to use it?  You always need to remember that..  Somebody with the time and determination to make that camp without your system isn't trying to screw you or anything.. they just want their epic.  It's up to you to show them why working with you is better for eveyone, and up to you to get them to trust you to reserve them a timeslot to make the camp for them. <br>
<br>
Responding with insults and a holier than thou attitude is the surefire way to break the system.  It suggests to  anyone who's unsure of it that you are bullies trying to monopolize the spawn.  It is not going to make anyone see you as somebody they'd trust to put off thier epic for another 4 months.  <br>
<br>
The most perfect, fairest system in the world will go down in flames if you try to shove it down people's throats. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

Not only did Feadorn decide to give this a shot, but we as a guild decided to give it a shot.<br>
<br>
Because of some undesirables we had in the guild, we had this tarnished name from the rest of the Quell community. <br>
<br>
Well we got rid of most of those folks and started to concentrate on our efforts in a more positive persuit from better recruitment to stricter enforcement of our own policies within the guild.<br>
<br>
I for one am glad to have that list in place, because quite frankly not only did I want to get along with the server community but got tired of all the ks'ing and ganking bullshit that subsequently came with that damn camp in the past.<br>
<br>
While the list is not perfect, I applaud the clerics for taking it in hand and making something better of it. Before you all say, well sure easy for you to say, you have a few clerics on the list, well I could care if we had one cleric on the list or five, makes no difference to me, its the fact that we all strive to get along regarding this spawn and not be total wankers with it.<br>
<br>
While epics started out as a good idea, they have totally taken what was decent about this game and turned it into a competition full of asswipes. I for one am glad that this camp is semi regulated by the server clerics, no matter what guild they are from. <br>
<br>
Basically folks, I guess what I am trying to say is that please take into consideration of not only yourselves and your guild, but the communtiy around you. <br>
<br>
Sure there are times when not only this spawn but others may be contested in the future, but it really doesnt have to degrade to name calling or finger pointing. Only children or Jerry Springer adults do this. Lets not be one of the two above and try to be nice to each other okay. <br>
<br>
Just for the record, I know I have acted like a Jerry Springer adult sometimes in the past. I too fell into that trap, for this I am sorry, but I strive to better myself constantly. We all have something to learn. Lets not be so blind and think we are elite to some folks. At age 36, I still learn things everyday to better myself. Its called life folks, so why not jump in and live it. EQ is fun, but the people and interactions are more fun and intriguing.  <p>Garaddor Ghoulbane

<br>
But I have come around to the clerics way of thinking on this mob. <br>
<br>
It is not like Quellious Quarters at all, this is the one mob (and the only one) that the clerics, not guilds are co-operating on.  NTOV and such whilst can be rotated now is impossible to do in the future...because this is guilds involved and not individuals.<br>
<br>
With the Ragefire camp, I believe something needs to be done about it.  VI have messed up, they may not admit it - but they may change it also - you just dont know....I hope they bring up 2 spawn places for Rage, much like AC to bring up some equilibrium.  But that's the way that it is atm, there's one rage and one cleric gets.... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Guilds whoever they maybe can no longer march in and even attempt to KS - why ? well you will find that there are a shedload of other guilds ready to engage already.  <br>
<br>
You will get petitioned by lots of members from different guilds and the GM will strip the epic and give it to the right person.  <br>
<br>
Clerics who camp Ragefire will be there for 1-2 months waiting their turn.  Lets face it - I would not want to do this, would any other none cleric? <br>
<br>
I know Syllie was there for about 3-4 weeks, I know Feadorn of ADD has been their equally as long and Gwendry of DOSG has been there equal time also. <br>
<br>
Hell I even got a tell from Feadorn at Saturday night because Gwendry had fallen asleep at the keyboard.   This is comradary of EQ ./.. bravo clerics!<br>
<br>
Such commitment deserves reward.  Whether it is the cleric on, the guildies anyone....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Good luck all on the Ragefire camp<br>
