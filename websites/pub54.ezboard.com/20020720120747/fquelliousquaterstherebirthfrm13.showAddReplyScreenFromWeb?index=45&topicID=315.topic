P.S. Voilence caused by your children IS your fault.  Teachers are not there to teach your children morality, that's your job.  The teachers job is to teach them how to read, and count, NOT how to be a useful member of society.  Saying that what your child does while not under your direction supervision is not your fault, is a cop-out.  Jeez, take some responsibility in your life.<br>

she said it was aggressive.  aggressiveness isnt wrong.  i pity the day that it becomes wrong. is this that day?<br>
<br>
she said it was violent.  it wasnt violent.  what the hell is violent bout playing cowboys and indians.  violent is NOT pointing your finger at someone and making a noise.  violent IS lowering your shoulder pads and trying to flatten the next kid into the turf.  yet the latter is standard after school development and the former is suspension?  football is violent. im not saying it isnt good. im just saying its fricken violent.<br>
<br>
whats next suspension for assault via two for flinching.  <br>
<br>
these activities dont have much to do with what they represent.  i mean cause those &quot;boys&quot; dont want to play with that &quot;girl&quot; are you going to suspend them for their clearly sexiest behavior.  YOU see the world in sexes.  YOU see the cowboys and indian as violent.  but the kids see neither.  its development. their minds are simplier.  stop complicated their damn world.  <br>
<br>
now the kid who got in trouble is being forced to see this play from an adults perspective.  thats never right.  thats sooo wrong.  i mean moving kids to maturity is fine by radical events that force kids to deal with adult points of view come out bad.  they arnt ready.  <br>
<br>
but thats what you have now. why do you think the kid was tearing?  cause now he has to deal with this whole new level of complexity befure the kid was ready.<br>
<br>
so wrong. so naive.  i mean clearly this teacher wouldnt show violent films to the students. yet she has just the same projected a violent context for the student to now understand.  . its just as bad.<br>

No one or two-parent household can raise a child to be a productive part of society by themselves. Children are a product of their environment, their WHOLE environment. That includes the daycare, the school, the church, the TV programs they watch, the people at the grocery store, their friends parents, everyone you let your child around is a part of who they are. <br>
<br>
Teachers are role models and children are naive. I do not want a selfish teacher as my child’s role model. Some teachers just go to 'work' to get a paycheck and others 'teach' because that is what they love. As a parent of a 3rd grader and 1st grader, and a mom whose dream is to become a teacher, I can certainly tell the difference between each teachers attitude from year to year. <br>
<br>
If my children are going to spend 7 hours a day, 5 days a week in a classroom for 13 years, you better believe that those teachers are instilling morals and values into my child, whether I want them to or not. For anyone to put <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of the blame on the parents for things that children do is absolutely ignorant. If it takes a community to raise a child, it takes a community to ruin a child.<br>
<br>
The blame you can put on the parent is the act of being oblivious to their children’s surroundings. The parent who does nothing when their son or daughter acts out in a violent nature or the parent who does not take the time to get to know their children’s friends. The parents who don't monitor the TV programs their kids watch or the parents who don't move their children away from the foul mouthed idiot at the park. <br>
<br>
My responsibility to my family is to make sure that we are not surrounded by useless members of society and when they are, to explain to them why that behavior is unexceptable. I should be able to trust that the school has hired a qualified individual to be a role model and care for my children when I am not there. It's a shame to feel like I need to sit in the classroom and baby-sit the teacher because of the low standards the public school system has for their teaching staff.<br>

So you want teachers and grocery baggers to instill morals on your children? No wonder so many people are broken in today's world. They have no center to create their lives around.<br>
<br>
As a parent it is MY responsibility to raise my children, not Old Man Wilson down the block who likes to play with his privates in public while staring at the little boys. YOU are your children's role model, whether you want to be or not.<br>
<br>
If you assume Carson Daily is going to raise your children with the same moral beliefs you hold dear, you are going to be in for a big surprise. You say it's your responsibility to make sure your children are not surrounded by useless members of society... and how do you plan to do that, kill all the useless ones or live in a cave?<br>
<br>
It's naive to trust everyone surrounding youe children. The key is to become a positive role model for your children, and instill in them a solid moral ground that they may stand upon when they are surrounded by a world full of pedophiliac priests and the nihilistic society that popular culture breeds.<br>

Your children wont always look to you and you alone for guidance and approval, unless you put them in a box under your bed. <br>
Even then they will probably end up taking advice from the rats that munch on their hair over you.<br>

It may be an idealistic goal to ask the public to be a positive influence on the children they encounter or work with, but its a goal all societies should strive towards. <br>

You may not be raised in a box as teenagers, or you may have looked for role models and influences outside your family sphere even sooner, but to say society on a whole is responsible, even partially, for rearing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  your offspring</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is flirting with disaster. So...some think that on top of teaching, grading, and supervising our children, teachers are also responsible for instilling morality? As if cramped inner city schools had the luxury! What's that? Your kid would never end up on the bottom of the school district? I guess it's tough @#%$ for poor families.<br>
<br>
Yes, I'm rambling and assuming as I get angrier at a thread that grows increasingly ridiculous, fluffed by so much idealism and wrapped in blindfolds it makes me want to puke.<br>
<br>
NO ONE can tell a parent how to raise his/her kids, but a parent can't assume a community shares his/her best intentions for their children. Just like you can't blame parents for a kid going on a rampage school shooting, parents can't blame society's indifference (ohh, and it must be so tempting to ration the responsibility), or their belief in goodwill will reward them with a photo of their kid on a milk carton. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 5/24/02 5:07:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umahogani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mahogani</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://arnemetia.homestead.com/files/MiscImages/star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Crack Dealer to the Stars</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/24/02 5:13:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=315.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.stationary.org/fantasy/peg.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Off topic/ Your opinion?</span><hr size=1> I scoff at it because it is a pie in the sky socialist view of the world that fails.  Utopia is a wonderful idea, but it doesn't work.  The world is full of people who are too eager to ruin it for everyone, sort of RL griefers.<br>
<br>
Having your children raised by those not close to the child, foments a atmosphere of apathy.  People who work for a government agency have too much going on to spend any sort of quality time with each child in their care.  Children need to know they are loved, and that people are interested in what they do and think.<br>
<br>
I never once suggested that children must not be influenced from outside the home, it can't be done.  My point is that if you take an important role in their upbringing, you create a solid base for them to be able to judge the value of outside influences.<br>
<br>
A society shouldn't strive to have any influence on child-raising, because there are too many different ideas on what is right and what is wrong.  Who is going to decide what values to promote, and which to squelch?  How many different religions are there in the world?  Which one do you think should set the morals for your child?  How about your neighbors children?  Morals come from religious beliefs, the American society is based on a Judeo-Christian set of morals, should we force those beliefs on people raised in the Budhist faith?<br>

You are pointing the finger at me saying my way of thinking is pure idealism based in a positive utopian mindset (as if thats wrong) yet you want me to stop and instead accept YOUR idealistic world in which a society &quot;shouldn't strive to have any influence on child-raising&quot; (pure idealism based in a negative utopian mindset) ?<br>
 <br>
Pessimism(sp?) is also taught in the home, you sound like you need a quick shot of euphoria to loosen that Nurse Ratchet collar you got goin' on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I have written about two pages but I will just blow up if I repsond to your post about there being too many different creeds and ideals in this world to raise a child with integrity and knowledge of these differences, so i will just quote a man of free mind <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Nice try, but my view of society does NOT require full participation, while yours does.  If you go back, you can actually see that I said:<br>
<br>
&quot; I never once suggested that children must not be influenced from outside the home, it can't be done. My point is that if you take an important role in their upbringing, you create a solid base for them to be able to judge the value of outside influences.&quot;<br>
<br>
There can be wackos out there who can try to influence my children with their particular flavor of idealism, and it will pass right by them.  In your model of society, EVERYONE is required to be willing participants in raising YOUR children, with the same values you hold dear.  There is no idealism in my philosophy, while yours is all idealism.<br>
<br>
Your quote is nice, too bad is has nothing to do with what I said earlier, so I'll say it a different way; Requiring society to raise your children with your beliefs requires society to share your beliefs.<br>
<br>
Oh, another quote that doesn't fit, though it can be turned around.  If you tried to influence my children, I would consider you a griefer, but you demand I influence your children, and raise them how you want them raised.  I want you to butt-out, and you want me to do your job for you.  Are you sure you would want me, a Conservative Republican influencing your children's world view?  I didn't think so...

I never asked you to raise my children, im asking you to face the fact that others ultimately will whether you like or not. You say you realize this, yet you refuse to take any action against negative influences... I dont get it... <br>
Im asking you to stop bitching about the people that accept this and decide to make a stand, demanding responsibility for societies actions, especially the ones that work with our children.<br>
<br>
If you were to read previous threads where I state my opinion in child rearing you will see I believe parents should take FULL responsibility for their kids actions. Yet that shouldnt stop us from demanding the same moral responsibility from others...again especially the ones that (WE PAY to) work with our children.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of your post, it just goes in circles for me. <br>
Most things we actually agree on.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Requiring society to raise your children with your beliefs requires society to share your beliefs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
I think this is where we are having problems...you require your child to have YOUR *moral viewpoints/religion*, I would just require that my child has moral viewpoints and integrity. <br>
So, society doesnt have to have my beliefs...in fact im glad they dont for the most part, it would be a really shitty world if I wasnt able to choose a path due to lack of choices.<br>
<br>
Also I think we are talking about different ages.<br>
<br>
btw I dont look like im &quot;trying&quot; to be passive aggressive (which I doubt anyone would ever &quot;try&quot; to do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) I add smiley faces in my writing because im actually smiling when I type it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

-- Quotes Sublac<br>
<br>
Others <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  raise</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> your children when you're out of sight? That's a strong word. I'd say others influence or encourage/discourage already-formed ideas in children when parents are not there, unless the time kids spent with their parents growing up are so fragile and easily broken it requires the parent be there 24/7 to instill a core value system over and over.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm asking you to stop bitching about the people that accept this and decide to make a stand, demanding responsibility for societies actions, especially the ones that work with our children.&quot;<br>
<br>
How about I take responsibility for myself and realize it's impossible for society, including caretakers, to act within the bounds of what I see as acceptable day in and day out?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Yet that shouldnt stop us from demanding the same moral responsibility from others...again especially the ones that (WE PAY to) work with our children.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
This <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> idealistic, Sublac. How do you know a teacher's moral compass points in the same direction as yours unless you're willing to take the time to screen adults that have a lot of contact with your children? When a parent takes full responsibility for their kids, as they should, they explain what is/is not acceptable behavior and language, instill a belief in a higher being (or not), a racial outlook, a work ethic, value of possessions, etc. The list can go on forever. Yet you claim other members of society have a moral obligation to rear your (generic) children? Well...will it be a Christian rearing, Buddhist, maybe Muslim rearing? Will these people have to turn their ethics (religious and otherwise) around to fit your picture of the world around your kids? Understand that what is true for me may not be true for you. There is no &quot;ultimate truth&quot; different peoples share. You're holding the world up to an impossible standard and asking it to bend itself around your kids when it is easier to be a guide yourself and let kids form their own opinions of society.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 5/25/02 11:57:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uafropyrm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>afroPyrm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/25/02 4:29:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=315.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Off topic/ Your opinion?</span><hr size=1> Do any of you, who are arguing so adamantly about the formation of human psyche, actually have any type of formal training in the area?

What it sounds like is you might have read a few articles in Parenting Magazine or have read nothing at all and are basing arguments on what you have &quot;picked up along the way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let me tell you, conventional wisdom will only get you so far.  If you actually want some answers to this debate, there are plenty of books written by people who do nothing but study child behavior, and they can offer many (educated) insights.

I'm sorry, but I don't recall saying anything like this. I never said EVERYONE was &quot;required&quot; to raise my children. In fact what I did say was:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My responsibility to my family is to make sure that we are not surrounded by useless members of society and when they are, to explain to them why that behavior is unexceptable.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That doesn't say that EVERYONE is required to raise my children. What that does say is the people I let my children around has alot (alot does not say everything) to do with who they grow up to be. I want my children to see all YOUR personalties so that he/she can choose the right path for him/herself when that time comes. I want my children to be better then me, not be just like me. <br>
<br>
Why blind a child from reality and then when he/she is 18 yo let them enter the world naive and dependent? I want my children to know what is coming their way. This world isn't the fantasy world some parents let their children believe it is. Those parents who baby talk their 12 yo make me sick to my stomach. People don't always say nice things, people don't take care of you, and people don't do what you want them too. If you believe that, then YOU are in a fantasy world. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ...death look....That is truly funny! *shivers*<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are right Stylee, it is pretty funny. It's pretty funny that a child will come forth and tell the truth once they have been &quot;scared&quot; into it, so to speak. I'm not saying it is right or wrong to &quot;scare&quot; a child into anything and to be completely honest, I wasn't even in the room when they asked her again, but she knew I was there. The seriousness of the knife being brought to school must have smacked her in the face when parents and 2 police officials showed up. That, in and of itself is not anything any 7 yo should have to go through, but again, that is how the school decided to hanlde it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Do any of you, who are arguing so adamantly about the formation of human psyche, actually have any type of formal training in the area?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

No book is 'the only way' to do anything. The books are written to give you insight and ideas. My Accounting degree is no where near a psychology, sociology, social psychology, counseling, anthropology, or anything at all related to human behavior, but being a successful parent is.<br>
<br>
If you want to debate, that is one thing, if you want to throw stones, that is another. Did you ever think that the smiley faces after comments are jokes. My rule of thumb is to read these board with the best of intensions. If you are a negative person, you will read them in a negative way and vice-verse. <br>
<br>
I don't claim to be perfect and I am not forcing my opinions on any of you. I believe in respect for other peoples opinions even if I don't agree with them. Agree to disagree.<br>
 <br>
We are pieces to a puzzle. We all think differently and when we come together we form a community. That is the community I want my family to be a part of.<br>

That's exactly what I was saying.  You can't just read one thing and hope to get all the answers.  If you truly want educated advice from people who do nothing but study children and families, read anything you can get your hands on that isn't formatted to be a Barnes &amp; Noble wussy self help book.  Get a sociology journal.  Read things that only professors and grad students read.  That's where the thick stuff is.<br>

Again, my sentements exactly.  I am not going to try to give you financial advice just because I read Money magazine and took two courses on economics.<br>
<br>
No I'm not trying to throw stones, though this is a flame board.  Just offering my advice since everyone is arguing what they &quot;think&quot; instead of what they have learned.  This whole community vs. parent argument is senseless.  Life is not black and white.<br>
