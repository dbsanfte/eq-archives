    “Welcome, Malsar, to the Soldiers of Tunare,” said Heartwood Master. I looked up at him and nodded. I wasn’t sure how to act in front of my newest guild master. My old one, the leader of the Warrior Guild, was strict and had me do many tasks that were hard and painstaking. But I had a feeling that Tunare has shown me the way to the arts the ancient Druid. “I am Heartwood Master and I am the leader of the Soldiers of Tunare. I hope that you will learn much and will share what you have learned to the rest of the world!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Aye, I will try my best Master.” I replied. I think that is what he wanted to hear because a huge smile can across his face.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I like you, Malsar. You seem to be different from any other Druid I have helped learn. You don’t seem to be as greedy and selfish as most Druids are.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you, Sir. I feel that the only wealth comes from the feeling of helping save one’s life.” I said, holding my head high. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Haha, you are truly a pure blood Druid! I will help you personally with your lessons, Malsar! Now be a good lad and get me some items for me?” He asked with a gleam in his eyes.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Sure, Master. What is it that you need?” I asked<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “As you know, Druids don’t believe in the use of weapons. And with what weapons we use, they are blunt and dull. The only weapon Tunare will let us use that isn’t a blunt one is the Scimitar! I need you to find as much rusty slashing weapons other than the Scimitar and bring them to me! Only then, can I show you more about the Druid’s art!” He said in a powerful voice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “As you wish, Sir! I will get on it right now!” I replied and then turned for the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Wait, Malsar!” Heartwood Master said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “What is it, Sir?” I asked wondering what else he needed me to do.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Before you go, let me bless you with the spells of Tunare!” He replied. As I watched him begin to chant something unknown to me, I saw streams of light surround his body. Then with a mighty push, he forced the light toward me! As it hit me, I felt a strange sensation! My body felt stronger, I felt faster, and I felt my old battle wounds heal! “There you go, Malsar. Bring me those items and I will start you on your journey to becoming great!” chuckled Heartwood Master. I nodded and headed out the door.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It was about eight o’clock when I was finished with Heartwood Master. It was too late to go kill the Orcs that wield the weapons the Master needed. So I headed to the Tavern. Kelethin is peaceful, I thought to myself as I walked to bar. I passed the Inn next to the lift. There was laughter and a good smell coming from the building. Too bad I don’t have much money; I wish I could afford one night in the Inn. I took out my moneybag to see only ten copper pieces. “Damn, it looks like another night behind the Tavern!” I said to myself. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As I neared the Tavern, I heard the laughter coming from it. But this laughter is different. The laughter from the Inn is a peaceful, one that a family would have. The Tavern laughter is the sound of ten men telling stories of many battles fought and many friends dead. Laughter is the only way to release the pain that stays in their minds.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I opened the door to the Tavern and saw the regular crowd as well as a couple friendly faces. Ridic and Tyranex were sitting in the corner of the tavern, laughing at the drunkard dancing for money. Ridic is a Half elf Bard and a good one at that. He normally sings outside the Inn on Sundays for some change and another woman to charm with his songs. Tyranex is a Barbarian Warrior. I don’t know how he found his way to Kelethin, but he did. He is a regular warrior except he is fiercely loyal to his God and will duel anyone who puts him down.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Don’t you find making that man dance for some booze money a little mean?” I asked them, chuckling. The truth is, the drunk man will hide behind trees during the day time and when a youngster isn’t looking, he will pick up the dead body and run off. Selling what he can so he can afford three or four rounds of Mead at the Tavern.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nah, I think he likes it. Anyway, if he can rob us of our kills then we can make him dance for money. Haha, I think it is a fair trade,” replied Ridic with a smile on his face. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Tyranex didn’t say anything. They other day the man ran off with an Orc Pawn’s dead body. Tyranex almost died killing that beast and he wasn’t happy about it. “I think is it fair and I don’t care what you say, Malsar. That man is a thieve! And I think he deserves it!” yelled Tyranex.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Calm down, man. I know he does!” I said. I didn’t want to get him mad. He had a bad day again. “So, what is going on with you guys?” I asked, trying to get off the subject.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nothing, my Guild isn’t here. So I cant get anyone to let me do an errand for them! They think I will run off with what they give me!” Tyranex said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Hehe, that is because you are one ugly Barbarian, Tyranex.” Ridic joked with Tyranex. “Well Mal, nothing much. Just collecting some spiderling silks for my guild leader. With each one, he give me new lessons on how to become a better Bard.” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How many you got so far?” I asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “About ten now. But those spiderlings are hard to kill. And numerous times, the poison almost killed me!” he replied. He stood up and showed us the places the poison had entered. “The little bastards pack a punch!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “That sucks man! Well if you need anymore tell me. I have twenty of them in the bank. When the children’s parents kill the spiderlings because they hurt their kids. I go and take what I can off the bodies. I heard that the Bard Guild was looking for them, so I saved them for you.” I said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Cool, thanks man. When can I pick them up?” asked Ridic.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Now if you want. Bank isn’t too far from here.” I replied as I mapped out Kelethin in my head. “Tyranex, want to come?”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nah, no thanks. I will stay here and listen to the older warrior’s tales. Last night I heard of great battles in the Desert of Northern Ro; it is on Antonica. You guys go along. See ya in the morning!” Tyranex told us.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ok, stay safe, Tyranex!” both Ridic and I replied.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As we walked out the door, we saw Tyranex walk over to a table with some older men talking. He leaned over and started listening to what they were saying. Then he looked at us and waved good-bye.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Outside the Tavern, we could see all the lights of Kelethin. We started our way to the bank. We passed the Goods Store and took a left, up the ramp, then right. When we opened the door, the guard stood up and bowed before us. “Good Evening, young lads. Hope Tunare has blessed you on this fine night?” he asked us.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Indeed she did, my good man!” I replied and bowed back to him. We walked over to the banker who was repairing his torn tunic.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Damn kids!” he said. He looked up and saw us standing there. “Ohh, umm. Hello. I wasn’t talking about you. I was talking about those children of the Rogue Guild! They keep cutting my tunic while sneaking up on me! Well, enough about me. What can I help you with?” asked the banker.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I would like to open my bank box please, Sir” I told him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Aye, I would like too as well, if that wouldn’t be a problem?” asked Ridic.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Not at all. Can I have your names?” replied the banker.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Malsar” <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Ridic”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Malsar and Ridic uh? Hmmm, ok here they are!” said the banker as he looked through the vault. “Here you go, young lads.” He handed us our boxes and pointed to a table in the corner of the room. “You can place them there.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you, Sir” we both chimed. We walked over to the table and placed our boxes on them. I took out my moneybag and emptied it in the box. Ridic did the same thing, but his bag was heavier than mine and had more than copper in it. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I took out the bag with the silks in it and handed it to him. “Here ya go, Rid. This should help you with your Guild errand!” I said. Ridic took the bag and took out the silks. When he handed the bag back to me, he looked at my money then frowned.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Is that all you have, Malsar? Ten copper, is that it?” he asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Aye, I will be ok though. I have a job for Heartwood Master I need to do. I will get paid for my services.” I told him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Here, have this” he said. He reached out his hands and dropped some money into my box. “ I stole that anyway. I want you to have it.” I didn’t know what to do. So I picked up the money and gave it back to him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “I don’t want to deprive you of your money because I cant save my own. Thanks, but no thanks, Ridic.” I told him. He just smiled and shrugged.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Fine your lose, haha.” He chuckled. “Where are you going now? If you want you can stay at my place. My parents won’t mind.” The sound of the word “parents” made me shiver because I didn’t have any parents. A gang of Orcs killed them while coming home from a party in Felwith. I was only two at the time and I was left with the Inn Keeper. I still can remember seeing their bodies as the Clerical Priest from Felwith bury them deep under Kelethin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Umm, uhh, Sure. I guess I could stay there.” I replied, still thinking of my lost parents.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Great! Follow me, Malsar!” piped Ridic. I nodded and followed him through Kelethin. I haven’t been to this place before, but by the way it looks, it must be nice. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After about five minutes of walking, we stopped outside a house with smoke coming from it chimney. Ridic opened the door and lead me inside the house. It was roomy. It had  three bedrooms and had its own kitchen! Most houses didn’t have one. But this one did! “Wow! Ridic, you have a nice house!” I complemented him. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you, Malsar. I really appreciate it.” He said,” Mom! Dad! I’m home!” I looked around and within ten seconds, his parents were there. Ridic introduced me to his parents, “ Mom. Dad. This is Malsar. Malsar, this is my Mom and Dad.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Nice to meet you, Malsar,” said his parents.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Likewise,” I replied, “You have a nice home here.”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Thank you, Malsar! And where do you and your parents live?” They asked. I just stood there and stared at them. I didn’t know what to say!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Errrr.Orcs killed my parents eight years ago. I don’t have a home. I sleep behind the Tavern.” I said. I thought the best thing to say was the straight truth.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “How awful!” they both said. They looked at me strangely. “Malsar, are you alright? Malsar? Malsar?!”<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I passed out.<br>
