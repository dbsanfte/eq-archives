I even waited 3 days to post it to make sure I really wanted to, and it has occurred to me that I should do my best to save future citizens of Norrath from his ummm, worthlessness (sorry, best I could come up with)...<br>
<br>
I have just discovered the joys of Karnor's Castle, and I am spending a lot of time there, just got two levels there this weekend. Down in the Upper Basement, I was grouped with some great people, talented players who could work really well as a team. We lost our cleric, fantastic one from Lotus Cult (sorry dear, forgot your name <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) to LD. We wait about 45 mins, a druid and I taking over heals, while we hoped for her to make it back. Giving up we OOC for a cleric.<br>
<br>
Enter Rezumall...<br>
<br>
Rez seemed like a nice enough guy, didn't talk much, but threw out the occasional CH while we pulled and killed everything we could. We had gotten a nice drop from a jailer earlier, so thought it might be fun to see what another had. Problem was, there were two. In comes the druid with Harmony. Before the harmony gets off, the monk waiting to pull twitches and aggros them both. Did I mention we have no enchanter? Hehe. Before I can ghetto mezz anything, the monk is down, the druid is down, and the rogue and pally are fighting. <br>
<br>
At this point, we are doing what any good group would do, and tell the cleric to camp. Nothing aggros in the room, and he can come back and rezz us all in exchange for being toys for them to kill time with while he makes a get away for the greater good (no messy CR).<br>
<br>
He won't camp, he runs into the hallway, casts a heal on someone, stands there. We keep telling this guy to camp, he won't camp, says nothing, just watches. Rogue is down, pally used his LoH. The cleric runs, taking one jailer with him, the pally follows him. I have one with me, and I don't know which way to turn to get out, and I KNOW the worst thing to do is die wandering around looking for the zone, best to stay in camp if you are lost (SolB Flashbacks). <br>
<br>
I see that the pally zoned, and the cleric not too far behind him. I managed to root the jailer, slow him and heal myself, and figured I would try to camp out while it was rooted, see if I can be of any help later. Better alive than dead I thought. Couldn't camp to 5 before roots broke on three occasions, so I continued to root, heal, and camp to get out of immediate danger. /q didn't appeal because I can't help myself while it beats the crap outta me while LD. I finally camp, log on an alt, tell everyone I am ok, then log back in to my Shaman.<br>
<br>
After all is said and done, we have lost 3, I camped, pally zoned, and cleric isn't saying a word, but apparently ended up in Sebilis. He hadn't zoned, he GATED to Sebilis after dropping his train on a CY group, then camped almost immediately, not responding to tells from the druid. By this time, the shouts are going across the zone, &quot;thanks for the train&quot;, and someone had died. I asked if a jailer was in there, and someone said one. So I apologized ooc for our poor choice of cleric, and set about to make a plan. <br>
<br>
First I checked out clerics, and Asion, level 60 was in Dreadlands, and graciously came in to help us with our rezzes. I was still stuck, not knowing which way to drag corpses. Kildayen, who's group was a victim of the cleric's train, was so great to come and drag the corpses. How he did three at the same time, I will never know. Is there a skill AoE summon corpse? hehe. I lost track of him up in the tower area, but I had cast levitate before I ran up and hopped over the wall, training my own passel of baddies to zone (TO THE LEFT). At least I don't train like a newbie hehe.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I wanted to tell the story in its entirety, leaving nothing out, for this is the absolute truth, and everyone should beware. We put absolute trust in our clerics, that if they can't keep us alive, at least they can rezz us, and this guy did neither. Better to have no cleric than to trust one who WILL fail you.<br>
<br>
This guy reminds me of a chanter I knew in my 20's name Mezumall, didn't even have Mezz memmed at Split Paw spires in SK...coincidence? /shrug we will never know...<br>
<br>
In closing this long assed post, I want to again thank the selfless assistance we received from Kildayen and Asion. They made a nasty situation a positive exp, and even though KC has a lot of squabbling, we all usually pull together to help out when the crap hits the fan. Thanks guys for making this game way funner than house work and doing laundry  <p><BR>

And this is how I met Salta *groans* *smirks* *winks*.  I am soloing in EW, trying to push lvls.  But soloing can get lonely after a week or two of it, so I try to get a group.   I get in with one at the Rygorr Fort.  I have a bad pull, my FD fails, we get 2 mobs to camp.  Another roamer aggroes.  The cleric and her RL b/f wiz gates.  Of course I died.  She comes back and revives Salta, doesn't respond to my tells, disbands. Think she revived me??? ...noooo.   So she goes on my shoo shoo list.  I make the run from Thurgadin and get my body, Salta comforts me...he can't believe she would do that.  I run into her in DL, pretty much the same crap...get in trouble she gates.   You try to give ppl the benefit of a doubt.  Ravenblade gets in a group with her in SolB.  He dies,  not only does she NOT rez him, she disbands him and replaces him.  After about an hour, he finally gets her to rez him ( I was in a Naggy raid and couldn't CR).  She's moved from the shoo shoo list to the @#%$ list.  I run into her here and there, and all of my close friends know I dislike this chick immensely.  Eventually I heard she left the game...*clap clap*<br>
<br>
LO and Behold, she came back about 2-3 wks ago.  She retags with ADD..but the same night, she's raiding with Wraith.  So, me being the bitch that I can be...sends a tell to Droz telling him that I would avoid this chick and why I disliked her.  A week later, she sends me a tell....I hear you don't like me much.  Hehe what gave you that idea...well, I didn't know I had any enemies she says.  I go on to tell her why I don't like her.  Oh dear, it wasn't her...her b/f played her character and did all those things.  *grins and rubs her head where she fell off the turnip truck*.   Well, she is now a member of Wraith......<br>
<br>
But most clerics don't abandon their groups, no matter whose fault a bad pull was or anything.  It would be like me FDing when things go bad and not helping with a CR....ethical ppl don't do that crap.   *comforts Whytspirit*  But sometimes you need to warn other ppl about bad players *Ravenblade should have listened to me*    <br>

You know you loved her Ari.  My personal favorite was &quot;DL is so crowded and boring, lets go to the ocean of tears and exp there&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Followed by.....<br>
Okay I've been here for 15 minutes and I know we spent 45 minutes getting here but I'm bored and don't want to do this anymore.  The rest of you are now screwed since you have no healer etc etc bye bye!.<br>
<br>
The time her b/f bound himself somewhere in SolB to port out to get spell components only to gate back and find out that she had moved camp on him and left him to die to the repops was incredibly amusing too.  She obviously can't blame that part on her b/f unless he was just like the most moronic person alive.<br>

I guess we all through our moments of lunacy where we sort of fall asleep without closing our eyes.  I know I did in Karnor, I just stared blankly at the screen whilst a pallys hps just dropped to 20%, then I CH'd waking up not realising that I should have used a different heal.  <br>

We have such dynamite heals, no reason to not be able to keep a group alive in a small over-pull (such as the ry'gorr fort).   At 47, my greater heal doesn't even move my mana bar.  And root certainly doesn't take any mana ....<br>

The last thing I'm ever going to do is let my group die without giving it all I had.  If things REALLY get messy and you are OOM, hit DA and run like the wind.  Just a thought from a lonely cleric.<br>

That's just a wasted spell slot.  Clerics should always bind at the zone they're hunting at.  I've been known to do a few naked DA/DB CR on wipes.  Saves a lotta time when group is all bound 20 zones away.<br>
<br>
I've heard other horror stories about clerics.  Makes me cringe when I hear one cleric's name mentioned.  The one I'm talkin about has been known to duel friends while grouped, then yelling oom in the pull and gating out. <br>

The Divina Aura is arguably the most important cleric spell (besides the obvious of heals).  I do the same thing as you, in that I will always heal in the order of: chanter, tanks, then myself last, however you do need to make sure you don't die.  What good is a dead cleric?  DA is great.  1 second cast time, gives you 18 seconds to med, and gives the others time to taunt off ya or mez.  As soon as it pops off, you can blast a quick heal on yourself and be right back in action.<br>

Back to thread topic, I saw Rezumall in DL today.  I considered lambasting him publicly, but decided against it.  He's in ADD now, btw.  Garaddor would surely be privy to know this info, and they do have an ezboard.<br>

There's NO reason to waste a slot with that cheesedick spell when you could put something useful in it's spot. Clerics who run/gate/panic at the first sight of serious trouble should be taken back to Oasis to learn how to manage and deal with aggro. Learning what to do and keeping your cool during a nasty, nasty moment will not only earn you points with others but will make you more confident in your role. <br>
<br>
Second of all... Salta's a great guy. I have only grouped with him a couple of times but I met him on the boards and have had several interactions with him. Kudos to those like him who play honorably and have fun at the same time!! /salute<br>
<br>
Thirdly.. Anyone who says &quot;my B/F or G/F was playing my character&quot; as an excuse for severe and sudden lameness in the game is still liable for that person's actions. You can delegate authority but not responsibility. Excuses are excuses but pissing off a ton of people because someone's using your account is NOT an alibi. Making a mistake is fine.. we all do that. But not taking responsibility for your own actions - or lack thereof - is just a crappy thing to do. &quot;No scooby snacks for you!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Opal... Divine Aura is actually a VERY beneficial spell and will save your group TONS of mana over the long haul. Instead of having your secondary healers trying to save *you* after a heal-aggro beating (thereby dumping their own mana and gaining aggro onto themselves), go INVULN and let the critters float back to the melee folks high on the Aggro list OR wait for a MEZ to stick. But if it suits you better to not use, then by all means do what you do and keep on keepin' on, girl!! <br>
<br>
To All Clerics - when your group is taking it hard and heavy and it looks like it's the end for the lot of you, do what I do and look for a nearby gnome...<br>
<br>
... and just strap him on your chest to absorb the mobs hits. <br>
<br>
Gnomemore pain!! Yay!!!<br>

In most groups I am in, in the guild and out of it, we try very hard to take care of the cleric. Not only does that include keeping him/her alive, but also making their job easier, and letting them know when things have gone horribly wrong and to bail while we keep the mobs busy. Camping a cleric is a common practice in certain situations, and if he would have done what we asked, we wouldn't have spent so much time on CR and rezzing.<br>
<br>
I was glad I survived the event, for it showed me what I can do if I don't give up and just die. I might have if the cleric hadn't &quot;zoned&quot;. I wanted to do everything I could to help because I wouldn't have to sneak into the basement. So maybe I owe that crappy cleric a thanks for giving me the opportunity to test my nerve a bit further. <p><BR>

And here is why:<br>
<br>
1) I don't feel the loss of the spell slot. With six slots and DA I have more than enough to heal in a variety of situations and do the crowd control (roots/stuns) expected of me. If a situation requires a chain-stun, for example, dropping Complete Healing for the extra stun is a no-brainer (I won't be chain stunning AND casting ten second long heals, will I?)<br>
<br>
2) &quot;You can always DA and run.&quot; Ignoring places where DA just won't get you to the zone, or where running to a zone is otherwise not an option, you also train every poor schlep in your path. Shouting a warning doesn't help the person zoning in as you go out, either. You have a spell that avoids doing this, and you DON'T use it?<br>
<br>
3) The best argument I've seen against having Gate up says that you can always DA, then mem Gate while DA is up. That doesn't mesh well with my play style - I use DA like Jolt, to get aggro where it belongs, and almost always end up clicking it off to throw a heal. Being forced into memming Gate if I have to DA (if you don't, you KNOW what'll happen later) takes the one thing away from me that I trust the most after 60 levels - my judgement. I also feel uneasy about going for Gate after firing DA if the call to run is given because there's a good chance I'll be left alone when the evac goes off/when I stand up to Gate. And that means whatever made us run will be focussed on me.<br>
<br>
4) Why would I want to get away, instead of fighting to the bitter end? I trust my judgement as to when a fight is lost and when it's OK. I've fought until everything was dead, with me and two remaining tanks all at 40% health, and not Gated. I knew the fight would be won with the people in our group if we kept our heads, and it was. I've also seen a group I was in at D2 get three Krups out of nowhere, had them beeline the ENCH, and kill her before she could even cast a stun. Me, a monk, three rogues, and four Krups with respawn incoming, and the one rogue screaming &quot;RUN!&quot; I hit Gate, got out, and was able to organize the CR after the monk and one rogue abandoned us. My judgement told me that with the damage output we had, we couldn't kill four Krups before their damage output overwhelmed my ability to put people back together again. That leads to....<br>
<br>
5) CR. If camping in place isn't an option, then the group needs to fight back in. They're going to be a LOT better off with a cleric with full WIS/MANA and full buffs than with a cleric with 500ish AC, base HPs, 123 WIS, and no Symbols or buffs including symbol (Aegolism). Losing Symbol hurts, and no, a group facing CR does NOT rely on others being around to help out.<br>
<br>
So my Gate spell is staying right where it is, thank you. :-) I DO always bind by the zone I'm adventuring in or as close as possible to that, though. It's my job!<br>
