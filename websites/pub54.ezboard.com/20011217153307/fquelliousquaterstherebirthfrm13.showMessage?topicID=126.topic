I know the victim(s) of this guy are daft to have done what they did, however that doesn't excuse the scammer involved.<br>
<br>
A member of DoSG was auctioning in EC on Thursday night to buy his first ever piece of decent gear, an FBSS. He'd been saving for it for ages and with a bit of help managed to scrape together 5k.<br>
<br>
Lasueur saw the person concerned auction that he wanted to buy the FBSS. Now my guildie has has never bought anything of any great value in EQ before, I don't think, and being the kind sweet natured person that he is didn't realise what a bunch of fecking wankers Verant have for some of their customer base. The guy said he had an FBSS on his monk and took the money with Lasueur. He then pottered around for a good 30 mins answering tells from both me and the victim, saying he was nearly ready to transfer it. After that he stopped answering tells, and I suspect both of us went onto ignore. I tracked him to Shady and sat looking at him sending the occasional tell. Just before he logged off he and another char, Wienar, stepped into trade distance facing each other for about 90 seconds (this isn't necessarily an accusation, but it did look damned suspicious to me *shrug*), then both logged off and weren't back on for at least a couple of hours.<br>
<br>
Through shouting to the zone, Cat discovered that at least one more person had been hit by the same guy in the same way that night. We petitioned (just to get the guy stopped from doing it again - not in hopes of recompense) and were at first told that it was a case of &quot;human nature&quot; and that things like this happened in EQ just as as in RL, sadly. It was then pointed out that in RL the guy would be arrested, and the GM caved and told us that if we wanted to take it further we would need to contact the server GM. Which is of course really helpful to a British guild who are asleep when the server GM is at work..<br>
<br>
Anyways, last night Cat logged on to find Lasueur pulling the same scam in EC and he'd already hit 2 people by the time she got there. To cut a long story slightly shorter she petitioned again and got one of the other victims to do it too, and lo and behold the GM's actually did something this time (we just don't know what). They followed him to the bank and watched him dump some more money at which point they apparently dropped invis and started to talk to him. He then went LD, though whether by choice or through being booted we don't know.<br>
<br>
If he wasn't banned by the end of last night and he manages to reappear in EC, don't ever, EVER trade with this person - they just aren't worth your time.  <p><h8><font color=#0505ff> <center>Sarcastic? Me? Nah, you must have some <i>other</i> Shagbert in mind..</center></font> </h8>

<br>
If he has not been banned through all this, please avoid him. He has pulled many scams from what I have heard from people who trade regularly in EC, and does not even defend himself when accused (I'm pretty sure I went straight onto his ignore list after I demanded the 5k back, lol). <p><HTML>

I know that I personally wouldn't part with 5K to someone I didn't know without the goods in my hot little hands. Maybe I am less trusting of the general nature of folks. I think it's indeed quite tragic that people not only lose their hard earned pp, but also their innocence. The real crime is that thee people are not dealt with harshly enough, and victims rarely if ever receive recompense.<br>

I do hope the GM has the balls to do something about this thief rather than a mere slap on the wrist.<br>
<br>
And people wonder why I refuse to loan people things. Personally, this my thought on strangers or people I'm not familiar with: I don't give a rat's ass what your friends say about you. They can say your sh$t don't stink and made of gold and I still won't trust you, so don't tell me to ask this person and ask this person about how trustworthy you are. You show me the goods, and I'll show you the cash. That's why the trade window was implemented.<br>
<br>
Something sounds like a great deal? Well show me. Have the item on another character? Well log that char in and I'll pay him/her. You can figure out how to transfer your money. That's not my problem. Sounds like a bitch? Damn right. I'd rather pay extra for a not-so-great deal than to completely lose out. <br>
<br>
I once had someone completely jump down my throat for not &quot;trusting people in a game based on friendship,&quot; to loan him my Amulet of Necropotence just so he can frolic around in skele form. Hey, it was MY item, I didn't know the person, why should I trust him? Who's to say he can't /q soon as I &quot;loan&quot; it to you? That person's justfication was, &quot;I'm 50+ lvl I'm not going anywhere, and you know so and so is my friend so you can trust me.&quot; That's right, this game is based on friendship. When I know you better and consider you my friend, I'll consider loaning you my goods. Friends have enough respect take no for an answer.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

These people destroy the good nature and enjoyable atmosphere of the game.<br>
<br>
I have done probelly over 30 personal transfers for people I have never met and have only recieved even a small amount of payment maybe 3 of those times. (I do not care about payment ... damn I am a druid if I wanted I could make 1k in 30minutes)<br>
<br>
The point is that people trust people in this game (the especially trust you if you are high lvl) and when someone is scammed it really makes you want to stop playing all together.<br>
<br>
For you scammers out there... just think ... what if u spent hours on making 5k and all of a sudden the person you trust to give you the goods for that 5k rips you off.<br>
<br>
I mean alot of people in this game only have limited time to play and when you loose this much money it really gets to u....<br>
<br>
Just put yourself into the shoes of the scammee.... <br>
Maybe you will learn something about honor and trust....<br>
<br>
For those of you that have scammed or are still scamming people... you have no honor... and as far as I am concerned without honor you have no life...<br>

Several days ago I ran amock in a chaos filled night of comedy, which included busting up a casino I felt was running a scam. Strangely enough, one of the 2 people (besides the actual casino owner) shouting that it was legit was...yes that's right, Lasueur.  He came to the casino owner's aid directly after I told the first person sticking up for her off, leading me to the possibility that perhaps Lasueur has an alias by the name of Neeno, a halfling rogue.<br>
During our arguements, Mr. Lasueur seemed very proud of his &quot;mounds of cash&quot; he kept trying to cram under my nose, and even had the nerve to call me a newbie.<br>
