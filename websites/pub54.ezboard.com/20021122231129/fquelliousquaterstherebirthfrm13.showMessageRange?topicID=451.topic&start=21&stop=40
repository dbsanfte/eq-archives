Denia, manaburn isnt only for &quot;stealing&quot; content from midlevel guilds it is a good aggro utensil for mobs like THO and such who take forever to kill... I do more  DPS with using manaburn and medding back up to nuke cause I don't have to worry about aggro.<br>
<br>
What wizard do you actually play? you got a lvl20 wizard now?<br>
<br>
and I agree with lalian... Guilds are responsible for all their members whenever we have someone do wrong we punish them or have a long chat.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A> at: 8/4/02 8:36:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utarfcrackleberry.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tarf Crackleberry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/4/02 8:58:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=451.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryohki/Manteca and the Sev gank early sat morning</span><hr size=1> No, that is not the moral of the story.<br>
<br>
The moral of the story is that maybe the MB team needs to /OOC the zone and announce their intentions or send a tell to the other group and verify what they are hearing.<br>
<br>
This is two MB threads in one week regarding Sev.  Both are &quot;mistakes&quot;. <br>
<br>
Eighteen people in zone ought to be a clue that another raid is there and that the MB team should back down.  That is, IF, what is posted in the other thread is true.<br>
<br>
Wraith absolutely condones this conduct by keeping him in the guild.  If someone in my guild acted like this they would no longer be in the guild, if I had anything to say about it.  And if the guild told me, &quot;no, they are staying in the guild&quot;, then I would deguild.  That is how each individual Wraith member has responsibility for this guy.<br>

<br>
Tarf, lets say you have a brother..you guys were SOOOO close growing up, etc...then your brother kinda started taking the wrong path, and doing wrong things...Its ok cause man you love your brother and you would do anything for him...then one day you find out that he shot someone trying to steal cig's...do you now hate your brother?  do you tell him he is never welcome in your house again?  I know i wouldn't, he is your brother, you would still try to do anything for him, no matter how disapointed you might be with him.  It is extremely hard to boot people on someone elses accusations.<br>
<br>
If  all of this happened exactly how it was described, its pretty fucking BS and im extremely disapointed with the person who did it, but its hard to kick your family out for something like this.  <br>
<br>
So in short, think of wraith as a big dysfunctional family who kills people for cigarettes and does AE in sebilious with Fingers of fire....<br>
<br>
Sorry palazious, your a great guy, if this were gonna happen anyone it is that much worse for happening to you...Hopefully there will be a next time.<br>
<br>
PS: I dont know what im talking about, its late and i like beer =)...I think i was trying to make an analogy out of someone being kicked out of a family for a bad deed and relate it to eq...lol...GO ME!<br>

The one last week was mostly a problem with communication. This last one was a blatant attempt by one person to deceive fellow wizards and to circumvent proper procedures asked that raids follow by the mana burners themselves on that previous event. It was probably quite easy to justify to the other wizards that the Dark Brigade raid &quot;just couldn't pull it together&quot; so go ahead.<br>
<br>
I am going to repeat, this is not a flame on manaburners, it is a flame on one disrespectful, dishonorable porr excuse for a player. It is not even a flame on Wraith.<br>
<br>
However, it would be a responsible guild who would take care of this issue internally as well. Members who act in this way reflect on the guild tag they hold, and by not censuring this person, they are condoning the behavior. ADD has similar issues, and took proactive steps to weed out or discipline their members and bring them in line. I find that highly commendable and in doing such, they have the respect of others outside the guild, as well as more self respect in their ranks. <br>
<br>
I would like to think that a guild such as Wraith that accomplishes so much would be able to make a dishonorable member shape up or get out. If they are a loyal member to the guild, losing said membership might be an incentive to tow the line. If not, what good are they to you anyway really? You have enough good people that you don't need the likes of this wizard or others like her. <p><table border=0>

Is my brother clinically insane? =P I'd forgive him, but definitely turn him into the authorities. Actually, it wouldn't be up to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> me</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to forgive him. This person didn't shoot someone over cigarettes. They cheated a group of players out of an event and took the burners along for the ride provided the burners where in the dark. This isn't a message board for after school detention and guilds aren't dysfunctional families. So leave the rearing to his parents and boot his ass out.<br>

<br>
<br>
let me show you what fingers of fire really do Denia.<br>
<br>
<br>
anyway<br>
<br>
<br>
maybe for your fights manaburn isnt a good tool but for Rel fights it is.. cause we like do to things slowly.<br>
<br>
And Sev is this most popular manaburn target cause he is in the same zone as the port relatively close and can use sense summoned to see his pet to see if he is up.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the wizards were lied too? dunno I wasn't there or I would have told you.<br>
<br>
If there is a raid with 20 people at a dragon rather than roll train them or wait 20min... Just let them the normal raid have it.  There will be plenty more Sevs and other dragons for burners to get.<br>
<br>
Oh and it would be best to get an explaination from a guildmember who did wrong to find out their story before doing anything. <p><center>

  I dont know what else to say cause i didnt read 70 percent of the posts because its most like bullshit like &quot;boo fucking hoo wizards have this coming to them because they keep abusing this ability&quot;Or flames toward wraith from people who dont know what they are talking about.Also i read something about this burning not being setup thru a chat or anything or something like that,also whoever posted this dosnt know what they are talking about. <p><center><a

We are instructed to keep any bitching we do about events such as this in guildchat ONLY. The officers hold us to a high standard of integrity and class and it is up to them to communicate to those who are wronging us. Believe me, I would be the first to blast someone for being an ass towards us, yet out of respect for their authority, we trust them to handle it on the guild's behalf. <br>
<br>
I would be interested in hearing from the other burners as well, and I am sure eventually we will, but until then, I will stand by Palazious' assertion that they were in the dark. If I am wrong, I will admit it if there is some evidence they knew what was going on. I am also willing to bet that Ryohki was the one who got the loot. Again, correct me if I am wrong.<br>

Come on out Ryohki, defend yourself, and who got the loot? Or have we already got things pretty well nailed down....hmmm?<br>
<br>
Oh and as far as being ebayed, and it not affecting her skills, that is one thing, but it seems to me that maybe she just bought the wizzie so she could get mana burn, and being a seasoned player, that doesn't speak highly of her because she should be better than a loser who abuses the ability. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uketelkaotic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ketel Kaotic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 166<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/5/02 4:48:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=451.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ketelkaotic.com/dancer2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryohki/Manteca and the Sev gank early sat morning</span><hr size=1> i love how you guys are waiting for the people involved to come here and post so you can jump on them....<br>

Jama will probably never read these boards and even more assuredly won't reply to them. He is one of the nicest and most selfless persons I know in the game. So to tell me &quot;you are defending him without a clue&quot; is short-sighted. I DO have a clue about him and I'm sorry I have learnt the hard way that the stories here are one tenth true and nine tenths BS. I refuse to believe Jama will intentionally train.<br>
<br>
Something I can tell you for a fact from raiding for years on and chasing more targets in competition than I'd care to remember;  you are a fool to belive that the MB wizards there were completley ignorant of the fact that there are 20 other people in the zone buffing for, and calling a mob and then complaining they are getting trained. Each of the MB wizards knew exactly what was going on and they were only doing what they have probably done tons of other times, engage the mob first and kill it. <br>

<br>
This is kinda sad though how you can defend this person for training a Sev raid....twice.  Only defence I've seen so far is that he used to be a good person and that hes so selfless and pure, and blah, blah, blah.  Another MB wizard already said that he was constantly  asking if dragons were up to MB....sometimes logging in to ask, then camping if they weren't, that doesn't sound selfless, that sounds greedy.<br>
<br>
This here would support my case of 'bad manaburners'<br>
<br>
And the reason that he prolly isn't gonna come here to defend himself isn't because he doesn't read this board, but because there is no defense for these kind of actions <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

You know... if you claim the number of people in the zone and /ooc banter was indicative that the wizards knew there was a raid going on, it's safe to say that Jama also knew what was going on as well. Training once, maybe. But twice? And how was burning Serv a &quot;whoops&quot; at that point *after* Jama ran into the raid? More importantly, how can you be sure the wizards willingly burned Serv knowing apparently a raid was there to kill him, and Jama not know? You're being a friend Desi, and refusing to consider the possibility that Jama didn't care what it took along with the wizards. Perhaps it's safe to assume at this point that not all burners will back down after a raid claims the mob.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=Green>Moderator</font></span><br>  Posts: 374<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/5/02 7:42:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=451.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ryohki/Manteca and the Sev gank early sat morning</span><hr size=1> /shrug the wizards from that burn that I talked to had been told by Ryohki the other raid wasn't gonna happen and that's why they were to go ahead with the burn.  Then Sev is inc to camp and boom what else are they gonna do, eat the death?  Very nice tactics by Ryohki to not give anyone the chance to second guess what they were about to do.  <br>
<br>
I've played a wizard before and please spare me the &quot;it takes skill to get all those aa points&quot; bs. I picked up quad kiting in the Grey and didn't die all day long while getting 1.5 aa points before raid time.  It's also not hard to sit in a group, right click staff of temperate flux, cast ice spear, cast concussion, cast another nuke of your choice, maybe concussion again if mob isn't quite dead and may aggro you, sit and med and wait for the next mob (hitting the harvest spell is incredibly challenging, I'll give you that much... waiting for it to pop back up after you cast it takes sooooo long and it's disheartening when you just want your mana to come back faster =( ).  So there goes the whole &quot;it takes skill to level an ebay wizard argument&quot;.  I'm not saying it doesn't take any skill at all to play a wizard, I've seen Nindail solo a quite a bit of the Plane of Fear, but this cheesy argument that aa is somehow hard to come by as a newb level 60 wizard is pretty weak.<br>
<br>
So basically what Fkin said is pretty consistent with the message the Wraith officers have put out.  You honestly don't seem to care what your members do or who makes you look bad as long as you can give enough bs excuses that will justify their actions in your own mind.  Maybe a manaburn from Ryohki combined with the pull of a rare quest turn in mob by Moncleared would be a nice tag team combo somewhere in Norrath.  I really tried to leave guild affiliations out of this but it's obvious that the only person from Wraith that has any desire to actually find out what happened rather than trying to feed this board a huge load of bs is Denia... every single officer that's posted here has blindly defended this person without so much as talking to the guy.  As far as 9/10 of the stuff posted here being untrue.. last I checked everything I flamed Moncleared for had been 100% true, the only difference here is that the main message hasn't been lost amongst a guild to guild flame board pissing match.  It's an easy cop out to just say &quot;jama will never post here&quot; rather than to actually have him come and give his side of the story.  If you're so worried about how untrue 9/10 of the stuff posted is the next logical step would be to have the person you're defending post his side, but who are we to use common sense like that.<br>
<br>
Honestly what does Palazious, a wizard who will have MB one day, have to gain from stirring crap up over something if it really didn't happen?  He's not a Wraith-hater, hell he even had a wraith war there to MT for them.  <br>
<br>
Azile (one of the wizards from that raid and a guildmate of mine) felt really bad about what happened once I informed her that she had been lied to (she didn't even know anything about it til the next day).  Her take on the loot was pretty crappy but she asked me if she should hand over the orb of tishan to the other raid.  If any officer from Dark Brigade wants to follow up with her you'll find out she's one of the nicest people in this game and actually willing to work with you rather than feeding you some line of BS. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=451.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=451.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=451.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=451.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=451.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=451.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=451.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=451.topic&start=161&stop=172>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=451.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=451.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=451.topic&index=40><img src=http://quellious-collective.com/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=451.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=451.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=451.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=451.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm23">Archives-General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm24">Archives-Flames</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.92<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
