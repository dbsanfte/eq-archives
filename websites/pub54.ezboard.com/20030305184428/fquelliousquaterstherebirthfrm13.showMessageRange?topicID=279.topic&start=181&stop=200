Garaddor apparantly thinks the way to &quot;Ueberness (sorry no umlaut allowed here)&quot; is to bully into spawns and taking camps... All that makes you is a pariah.<br>

<br>
Im sorry to see noone even bothers to read my and tristadorns post which are the only ones of any relevance in the entire matter. Noone else had the info that we had and we were the ones issuing the orders so how can anyone elses post be of any relevance. Even Bippys ... i respect Bippy a lot and know her to be up and up person and i got nothing bad to say about her. Everyone seems to go like *absurd example out of court* (judge asks &gt; was the other guy first in the shop ... the Accused&gt; Yeh he was first in but only because he shot me in the leg from behind while i was in front of him otw to the shop ... the judge &gt; doesnt matter he was in the shop 1st you are found guilty as charged). I dont think i need to further explain anything other than what i did write in my post im sure ull agree its a very theral description lol even my own guildies told me its time consuming to read that book of a post.<br>
<br>
Id just like to adress that accusation about yael. It seems you are totally misinformed about that lol (as is most ppl that ever post here). That raid of yours was for a paladin whose name now escapes me to complete his Strength of Elements quest. The add raid was also for a paladin for the sme quest. You did not arrive first nor did we ... we both basically shown up in force at about the same time. At the early point neither of us was even aware that someone is shooting for yael so we both had 2 groups each in zone before we even started thinking hey those other guys might be here for yael too. I talked to that paladin who was leading your raid and proposed a rolloff as i always do. He said he has been waiting for yael to pop for months and wouldnt like to lose it on a roll. So we both agreed lets make it competitive and well just race to the mob. The agreement was reached in friendly and sportsmanlike spirits .. personally i thought we didnt have a chance of beating you to him since u were about to coth ppl almost directly to Yael ... if u had a mage camped in safe spot i dont know ... maybe just dragged him there and stick rezed im. Anyway he wished me good luck on breakin and i wished him good luck no the cothing. My force proceeded to fight our way down in what i can only describe as lightspeed since we arrived at yael before you guys were cothed. We hastily decide to pull and got wiped due to everyone being next to 0 mana from the breakin. Quite naturally in the spirit of the race you got in then and proceeded to kill the mob ... it was a fair and sqare race and you won it. I was the first to congratulate your raid and the paladin personally on the quest and kill and we chated for almost half an hour later discussing paladin class, inspected eachother equip and talked about how sad that yael is such a long pop. We did all this in good spirits .. my raid was aware of the race being a friendly competition and we all congratulated you on your kill. What caused you to beleive we were there trying to run over you is absolutely beyond me so please dont even start making accusations over thing u obviously have no idea of. Also please dont mock add ... our alleged huge force was an astounding AoW killing size of 13 people which was roughly the same as your force i would say. I never mocked anyone and much less gloated over someone elses failure and i do not deserve mockery and misstatements from anyone.<br>
<br>
Also even though i asked to be contacted in tells over the matter at hand Radiant did not do this. I made it a point of being online for 18 hours straight to give ample opportunity to do so. I am quite prepared to do something to redeem any wrongs and hurts real or imagined done to anyone by me but i suspect other party doesnt want any of that and will rather pout in the corner somwhere and for the next 6 months try to convince people that add is bad rather than accept what i would offer so we both could salvage some dignity rather than just close off to eachother and hail ourselves with gunshots. As it is in human society bad is always beleived before good so i fully suspect i managed to tarnish my name here no matter the GM ruling or my personal reputation in the past. So i guess i must live with it ... next time i should be less naive and not beleive anyone would even consider the flamed partys standpoint objectively.<br>
<br>
With that the matter is closed to me! Still awaiting in game contacts.<br>

When it comes to planar zones I believe that whoever is there first owns the zone til they leave.. Planes are different cause you have to break in....<br>
<br>
Ragefire is different.. But I still think whomever gets there with sufficient people there.. Gets the first shot.. <br>
I talked with a few ADD over this and they said Radiant Ks'ed Ragefire twice before and they were tired of taking crap from them and wanted a bit of revenge..<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but 2 wrongs dont make a right.. ADD was totally wrong in this.. Radiant was there first into the plane. I dont care if you wanted to save people from death.. You get in their first and its yours.. Thats the way Quellious plays..<br>

I'm wasn't there so I can't comment on what was known and unknown from my personal perspective. I can only comment based on the testimonies posted here and none of them show any proof that Verant's rules were viloated. If anything, the testimonies suggest that the rules were NOT violated. <br>

<br>
<br>
 i dont like postin to these kinda boards but here's my thought on the subject.<br>
<br>
you may or may not have Violated the LETTER of the law<br>
but you damn sure ASSRAPED the entent. <br>
the reason for the Pnp is not to insure people can get the mobs they want when they want just this last weekend i called off a guild raid to hate because i found out that another guild (FoTp) had already set up a raid starting the day before we had planed to go and ending the same day. could we (AoA/WoW) gone up there and forced the issue and taken mobs etc. YES easily as a guild we can rally a rather impressive force when the need arrises. HOWEVER its just and assholeish thing to do. and ya know when i talked to the raid leader and explained that i had planed a raid to hate nearly the same day he was KIND enuff to allow me to tag along AND allow me the chance to roll for the vamp essance (yet another part of the chanter epic) even though there were plenty of chanters in Fotp that needed this peice as well. <br>
Hey and ya know another crazy thing .. i met a bunch of new people, had a GREAT time and never saw vamp essance.  AND then day b4 yesterday we were short handed for UDB raid .. guess who was headed to Juggs.. hey my new friends in Fotp. i sent a tell. talked to them in there raid channel and was asked to leave while they talked about it. we worked out an agreement on the distribution of loot along the way and suddenly we had an overwhelming force that UDB trak couldn't stand up to. ( its called teamwork get your mommie's and daddies to explain it to you ADD or a teacher maybe as your parents did such a poor job so far ) <br>
<br>
heres a little something that i think you ADD people have forgoten... these mobs you have been so intent on stealing ( and thats what it is ) these mobs .. there gona pop again. supprizing as that may seem. its crazy .. if you don't steal a mob from another guild .. you WILL get a chance to get it again some othe day. now i know yall are ,to quote a guildie, &quot;chaseing the shinny&quot; but there are plenty of mobs to go around.<br>
<br>
untill recently i had no angst against ADD untill HOT where we had 5 seperate WHIPES caused by ADD ... <br>
<br>
untill Sev three or 4 days ago where we announced our intent and were told &quot;good luck&quot;  now when i hear someone say good luck i can listen to there voice and maybe tell if they are being sarcastic. you cant do that when they type it. ADD's meaning for Good luck is apparently Fu@K you were takin it anyway.  <br>
<br>
 and untill now when i hear the most descusting case of KS'n ever reported.  in my oppenion you may as well have trained them and taken there camp after they died watchin them do CR and tell them well you didnt call it when i /campchecked ... <br>
<br>
ya'll resorted to a bullshit tactic YOU jumped in where you were not invited.. YOU are the reason everyone is flaming you and petitioning you and YOU will be the reason other guilds band together against these kinda actions.<br>
<br>
ya'll should think for a minute .... what if you are in a camp ... fear hate pog what have you and 2 more or 4 more or 6 more guilds move in and say ohh well you haddn't &quot;attaked&quot; this mob it must not be camped... <br>
<br>
YOU have been shown respect in the past. when your guild and ours showed up for master Yael (im not sure the details on this so post them if you will) we didnt team up instead it was a &quot;race&quot; to get to the guy ... when we got close we found you there ... so we (aoa/wow) waited. we didnt attack draw agro heal mez nata nothing that could be called interfearing.  after your emarissing WHIPE we moved in on a injured Master YAEL and killed him ... this is how the PnP should work... you lost .. because your tatics / force strength or what not was not up to par with the mob.  and we killed him because ours was. and if you remember after that we resed / healed / buffed your raid group. that is called playing NICE.... we saved you alot of cash and a nasty CR .. why because we wanted to be able to work with you perhaps later on. in guild chat it was talked about and we decided hey ya lets res them as a  show of goodwill.<br>
ill tell ya now i wont piss on an ADD member now if their on fire. now i know that dosent mean alot in the long run but well i have no other option. i refuse to stoop to your level and steal what rightfully belongs to others i wont train you i wont do any of the nasty evil things you are so good at.  i will just add you all slowly to my /ignore list and move on with my life.<br>

Thats verbos account.  <br>
<br>
I mean on one hand you want the community to believe what you say as an honorable man, but on the other your completely glancing over one of your officers lying to everyone.  CLEARLY its a completely unreasonable account of the pull.<br>
<br>
You want honor. shoot verbo down right here.  oh banelion NOW your going to say that you werent there therefor your not going to shoot banelion down?  And in the breath before you just told Bippity that she shouldnt post on the subject?<br>
<br>
ADD followed radiant into Fear (got an excuse why)<br>
ADD followed radiant into the temple (verbo lies to cover it up)<br>
ADD out agrod bippity on the shissar (verbo lies to cover it up)<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Qindien was the reciepient of the Shissar piece.   He contacted me  saying that he has been in contact with GM xiek.  And he wants to transfer the Shissar piece to Maeve if maeve cannot obtaint the piece before tuesday - thursday.  <br>
<br>
I consider this a really big gesture on Qindiens part.  Thats my opinion though im not the party most involved.  If the GM had come to xiek and said this is what were going to do i might have said: HA!  But thats not what happened.  Qindien did something that showed maybe more class then i could have mustered in a similiar position.  We never know until we're in those positions do we?<br>
<br>
We worked fear all last nite.  We're working fear on through the weekend and most likely force available into the weeknights.<br>
<br>
It was a Vis guy in the nexus that said: sometimes words are harder to forget then actions.  Perhaps. And perhaps it seems like i've been an ass through this entire thread. But i been deliberatly atgonizing people that were saying version of what happened that were different then Bippity's into posting more specifics with largely succesful results. I know in my heart that bippity isnt lying to anyone so i stand by those words as justified by my goal.<br>
<br>
on this positive note, i bid you good day.<br>

I only read through the first three pages, banelions post, and finally the nice things said about Qindien.  Tempers have flared and that is understandable.  I was not there for the either Ragefire occasion or the Plane of Fear incident.  I actually just missed the PoF thing and I had no clue it caused this much turmoil til I talked to Qindien today.  I do, however, think it's bad that someone hates me, wants to eat my entrails, and hopes my kids are eaten by my pets.  It may have been bad what ADD did.... I don't know because I wasn't there.  I like to think that I am a good player and just.  There are alot of cool people in the game and I like to have fun.  I think it gets a little out of hand with posts talking about how I am scum without even knowing ME.<br>
<br>
In this situation, Qindien has done a very noble thing.  He is my RL best friend that I have known for over 20 years now.  He is has helped many many people in game and almost rarely thinks of himself.  He is a very good person and a very good enchanter.  I would be willing to lend any support I can to your cause as well.  Do not hesitate to call on me.  I would gladly lend my sword to you any time.  I am sorry that such a well thought of person was hurt in the situation and I for one would do all I can to rectify the situation for someone that can and should be, a good friend. <br>
<br>
Take care and may the gods speed your way,<br>

So instead I will just send my applaud to Qindien. For defying the self rightious argument that ADD at no point in time did anything wrong whatsoever, and which is unable to even fathom the possibility that they or one of their members, an officer even, may have made a mistake, may have fibbied to preserve their image - who's arguement is so clearly flawed, inconsistent and blantantly evidence in itself to it's contrary (Verbo). Of course you cannot be entirely sure of everything that happened Q, but you noticed something amiss, you admited to poor conduct on the process of aquiring the item, no matter how much claim you may or may not have had to the spawn prior to the conflit.<br>
<br>
It doesn't seem this was a guild decision but one from Qindien alone. If it was a guild decision then please let us know that you have admited to at least the possibility of some mistake on ADD's part what why you came to that conclusion, and how that reffers to statements passed by your members as fact. And if you are willing to scorn publicly those in your company that negatively and significantly contributed to the whole incident in a disgraceful manner.<br>
<br>
If you can do that then my hope for your guild may be restored, mayhaps eventualy with some earned respect if the bad apples in command positions and otherwise are exiled or have their attitudes influenced by the good folk that you have in the guild. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=120776">Valmeria Nightblaze</a><BR>
