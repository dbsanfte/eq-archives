Oh, and she told me to stick something here if I wanted to, 'cos no-one ever goes to this board anyway. -- Shagbert<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Dear Friends,<br>
<br>
Gaelron was correct when he recently posted surprise at seeing me on the Flame Board. I do not normally post flames or my opinions to flames. But the above quote, made by Shagbert in his thread “Guess who, again? redux,” made me think of something that I felt I must share.<br>
<br>
Remember when you were little and you really wanted that [toy of the day]?  Perhaps it was an Easy-Bake Oven, or a Cabbage Patch doll, or a Transformer (hey, they’re more than meets the eye.) When you asked your parents if you could have one and they told you, “no,” you threatened to 1) hold your breath, 2) run away, or 3) hate them forever until you got one? What was their response? If they were good parents, they told you that, although they hoped you would not do any of those things, you were still not getting that [toy of the day]. At that early age, you learned that you could not control your parents with behavior modification.<br>
<br>
But what about those who never learned that lesson? At the first sign of a tantrum, the parent would cave and get their child the Sun-n-Fun Barbie with the Beach Accessory Kit. The child learned that bad behavior equaled gain. In most cases, the child learned that bad behavior also meant added attention. If he or she screamed louder than his or her siblings, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> they</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would receive more attention. Positive attention or negative attention did not matter. They only knew it was attention. As the child grew older, they found new and inventive ways to keep themselves the center of attention. Again, it did not matter whether this attention was positive or negative.<br>
<br>
We all appreciate attention. Most of us prefer the good kind… whether it is praise for something we have accomplished or gratitude for a kind deed. What bride does not enjoy marching down the aisle knowing all eyes are on her? What actor does not feel pride when he is applauded during a curtain call? But some people thrive on the negative kind of attention. In EverQuest, flames are, perhaps, the biggest form of negative attention we have. If we see our name here it usually means someone is giving us attention for something we have done – good or bad.<br>
<br>
In response to Shagbert’s quote of Sirinab, I can only say that I believe Sirinab thrives on negative attention. After all, if Shagbert quoted her correctly, she even suggested that he post something about her on this board. There are over 1700 posts to the Flame Board on Quellious Collective, and with over 540 registered members, the quote “…no-one ever goes…” here is incorrect. Sirinab knows this. I believe each flame about her fills her need and desire to gain more and more attention. When a previous flame dies down and the ashes are merely smoldering, she creates a situation that will fan the embers. And everyone who posts a reply (including this one) simply fuels the fire.<br>
<br>
Will this missive stop the flicker of flames? No, probably not. I am not attempting to put a halt to them. I simply wanted to give insight as to the possible explanation for the cause of the inferno.<br>

Unaccepted in the real world (and let's face it... if an 18 year old female cant have an active social life... especially considering the hormonal imbalances of typical 18 year old males... that's gotta be REALLY bad), and thus forced into the world of EQ to find the companionship that she cannot attain elsewhere?  And since she cannot gain recognition for her skills as a gamer, she gains her recognition by training, KSing, and basically making peoples' lives miserable when she's around?  So, if we wanted to REALLY get rid of Siri, all we gotta do is ignore her?  Hmmmm....<br>
<br>
Nawww!<br>
<br>
I cant help it.  Siri's like an automobile accident.  You know you shouldnt look... but you cant help yourself.  She displays levels of cluelessness and delusion that I can normally only attain when on a binge.  It's most humorous.  And best of all... it helps pass time while things are slow at the office.<br>

First he'd check twice to make sure that it was his guildmate simply because LM people don't act like this, then he'd do just like every member of LM/MC/DOSG would do and try to figure out what spawned the problem. <br>
<br>
I was an officer of the Moonlight Crusaders, and we experienced some narsty flames over the actions of a member. We immediately launched a pretty serious investigation into the event, talked with the people involved, and took care of the problem in a final way.<br>
<br>
Personally, if your loyalty to your guild is THAT strong, I'd be working on the problem. Even you have to admit that Siri ain't the most sociable and caring of players. She'd not survive more than a day in any guild that really cared about its' rep. Perhaps RIP cares about its' rep more than it appears to, perhaps Seph just isn't aware of Siri's rep and what she is doing. Seph's a busy guy. I doubt it though. I think RIP just doesn't give two sh*ts about what Siri is doing out of the fact that she is the best (only?) high-level monk your guild has.<br>
<br>
Were it my guild being questioned in such a serious and well-documented manner, she'd not have a guild tag at this point. That's just me.<br>
<br>
As far as Radjan's post goes, the only possible ways to modify anyone's actions in a setting such as EQ would be the polar opposites of Petitions or Behavioral Modification. Petitions just don't really work that well when the primary complaint is that the offender is a jerk. Thus the only option is behavioral modification. <br>
<br>
Sure, Siri might just really get off on seeing all these flames heading her way. She might just have such a pathetic life that the negative attention she receives is her only joy. We may very well be feeding a diseased ego. <br>
<br>
What else can we do? Flame boards such as this are the only refuge for the wronged. Do we allow her to get away with the MMORPG equivalent of murder? Do we stand idly by while she commits offense after offense against basic morality and consideration? Or do we rise up and level the big guns of rep destruction, spew forth the venom and bile of the consequences of ill conceived action, and let loose the dogs of flame?<br>
<br>
This behavior is intolerable. Given enough flames, given enough posts on badgamers.com, she might get her rocks off, but there might also be one more person that will not let her in a group, one more person that will not join a guild because she is in it, one more person that will let a zone know when she is acting out.<br>
<br>
So flame away, let her get her jollies. Better the world shall know. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

Sure I do.. coming here and talking smack doesnt make her a bad person.. Its actions not words that do the talking.. Does Sirinab get in fights with guildies too? yes.. Does she sometimes her herself a bigger hole with her arguements? yes  But is she as bad as everyone makes her out to be? no <br>
<br>
I don't think she enjoys the attention.. No one likes to be flamed, I think she is defending her actions.. She probably doesn't do it in the best way either but its her way of doing things and thats the way it will be.. <br>
<br>
Do we need to post a new Sirinab hate post every week?<br>
<br>
How many times do i have to repeat this? <p><a href="http://worldzone.net/technology/brian2554//signature.gif" target="_blank">

Thanks for playing, and while I think you take it too far, Gaelron, I really do respect you for your loyalty to guild and guildmate, and don't wish you to think I'm griefing you for that, merely for the object of that loyalty. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

<br>
The only time I ever talked to Siri was to tell her to plant her arse long enough for me to buff her.<br>
<br>
I'm not willing to question Seph because Seph ain't here on these boards. I am willing to question you because you've become the defacto Public Relations Officer for RIP, poor guy. I also understand fully that Siri is the best ya'll have and I pity you all for that. To be honest, she's not a bad puller. But I can name 10-12 pullers that are that much better. Actually, Seph is in that number, IMO, excepting the limitations of rangers pulling.<br>
<br>
The problem exists that even were she the Monk BotB for the server, I'd still not want her to have the same guild tag as me, due to her attitude, let alone her actions. Then again, RIP has shown time and again that the toon is more important than the person behind the toon. Not meaning that as a flame necessarily, more as a statement of fact about the prevailing attitude and style of those I know in the guild. Then again I can say the same about VM, LC, and any of the other guilds with such things as level minimums, required equipment, etc.<br>
<br>
RIP, with some good recruiting, could be a very strong force. There are some very talented and driven people in RIP, or at least there were the last time I was on. There are also some major jerks. <br>
<br>
I feel for you, Gaelron, as I think you are fighting a thoroughly unwinnable battle. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>
