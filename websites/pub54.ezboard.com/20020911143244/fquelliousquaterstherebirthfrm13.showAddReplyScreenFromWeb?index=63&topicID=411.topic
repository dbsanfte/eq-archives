<br>
So many things I missed though since I didnt join Legendary heroes til 51.. Stupid me and my preconceptions about guilds that didn't turn out to be true.<br>
<br>
I remember after &quot;Berber&quot; (believe I got that name right) passed away the day I actually worked up the courage to speak with Oriz about recruitment and got scared off for a good 2 weeks because of that.<br>
<br>
I remember Thundax (original one) and how good of a leader he was building what was one of the top guilds of its day before the server mood changed and people wanted more and it all fell apart. And how everyone was crushed over that.<br>
<br>
I remember the old Vis (early kunark) and how everyone hated them and people would stage boycott refusing to group with them.. Ah those were the days.<br>
<br>
I remember what it was like to be a paladin in guk where we actually did some good damage with ghoulbane. then when kunark hit paladins became the butt of jokes... Heck i remember when rogues were considered useless.<br>
<br>
I remember when we paladins use to stick together.. One of the closest knit classes out there but something changed. We use to go on noobie quests together and did groups.<br>
<br>
And of course i remember Vilu who was always there for me.. Got me into the choice groups of the day and raids.  Those late night groups we had during the summer were the best.<br>
<br>
So many good memories on Quellious.. There is no server I'd rather be on. <p><center>

<br>
I first started playing shortly after the release of Kunark.  I was turned on to the game by a RL friend of mine, known to the Quellious community as Cenydd.<br>
<br>
He and another RL bud, Montimus, got me involved in EQ.  It was suggested that I roll up a Druid to start off with, since it offered the widest variety of abilities and spells.  So, I created Rhes, and the journey began.  I, like Opalmoon, first joined the Midnight Suns.  This guild was named so, because it's founder, Willowpixie, is from the state of Alaska, which is known as the Land of the Midnight Sun.  The core members of this guild were all Alaskans at the time.  Several of the current LC membership were at one time, members of this guild.  Kailynn for example, and Lugor, although shortly.<br>
<br>
Cenydd and I had many adventures together.  I can remember my suprise and shock at seeing Lord Grimrot up in South Karana, and quickly getting Cenydd there to kill it for his Aegis of Life.  I can remember my first Plane of Hate raid which was done with the Moonlight Crusaders, whom I later joined with Cenydd.  I remember later my first raid on the Plane of Fear, when CT popped on us just before we had cleared the entire plane.  LC came by and saved our bacon, and joined with us in killing CT in the process.  I can remember my second PoF raid in which we pulled the temple to attempt the Shissar for Kimja.  It was the biggest rush I had ever experienced.  I had successfully aggroed over 8 Amygdalen Knights and Warriors and kited them off while the rest of the guild dealt with the rest of that pull.  They finally were victorious and were shouting that they had won, only to see me coming around the corner, running my ass off with 8-12 mobs chasing me.  I can remember Bulvai telling me later it was the damndest thing he had ever seen.<br>
<br>
I can remember sitting in EC, watching the auctions, when a dwarf warrior wielding epics strolled by, and I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen.  He was dueling people, left and right.  Finally he dueled a monk, level 58 to his level 60, and the monk was just kicking his ass.  Then as he went berzerk, he kicked in a discipline, the first time I had ever seen that, and reeled off over 1600 dmg in 10 seconds, downing the monk.  That warrior, by the way, was Poper.  <br>
<br>
/salute Poper<br>
<br>
I have so many fond memories of my time in Moonlight Crusaders.  I met so many fine people during that time.  Rennhelm(to this day the best sense of humor I have ever encountered in game), Mobious and Fiora (the Wreckers), Kimja and Kalani (the Jacksons), Alrik (Beard), Zeik (Ubermon), Bulvai (a_Bearhat_01), Raluvin (who's playstyle convinced me to roll my own warrior), Gosshawk and Loxosceles (rangers extraordinairre), Dies Alot/Falconus(Guild Founder), Sahazar and Keene(Keenehazar), Trebor(The Conjuror), Ghaniba and Patriarch (The O'Doyles), Campfu(Taekwanleap), Boldair (Boldy), and so many others, Lor Mani and DoSG(our allies).  We had our good times, and our bad times.  I like to think that the good, far, far outweighed the bad.  The tragedy of 9/11 as much as anything else, spelled the demise of MC a a guild.  Many of us still play, and I know we all hold a warm place in our hearts for MC.  It was truly a guild where FUN was greater than being UBER.<br>
<br>
I can remember soloing for so many hours in Skyfire, looking for spells and teaming up with a necro that I met there.  Slieoneous (sp?) was a member of LC at the time.  We grouped together, and spoke of many things.  The old QC board was up at the time and there was much talk of doing away with the reservation system and moving to FFA that we now currently enjoy.  We had many a heated conversation about it, sometimes me playing devils advocate, sometimes he.  I wonder what happened to him.<br>
<br>
Shortly after I joined MC and met Raluvin, I rolled up a warrior.  How little did I know that he would become my main.  <br>
<br>
I am now in Alliance of the Arcane, my 3rd guild on this server.  They are a good group of folks, and I am very happy there.  <br>

I, like Opalmoon (though I don't know her), came from the Realm.  I had some friends on that game that came here, so I decided to try it out.  <br>
<br>
My first character was a barbarian shaman, whom I promptly drowned in Halas lake.  Wow, whoda thunk?  I leveled her up to level 3 with that spiffy wooden club, never knowing I was supposed to get SPELLS sheesh, that mighta helped.  So, I decided this game SUCKED, and went back to Realm where I stayed safe and secure in my lil townie village for about 3 months when I decided to try it again.<br>
<br>
My next attempt was a wood elf druid (Aala), whom I leveled to 34.  GADS, I hate playin a druid!!  My first day back, I promptly fell off the city!  Oy, I must be destined to commit suicide within minutes of creation each character I make!  Was invited to a guild that day (what's a guild and where are you people? don't you know I'm lost?)  I was clueless, but I wasn't naked, I had a shiny brown chitin protector that someone gave me and I thought I was soooo cool!!  FEAR ME BATS!!!  People would shout for a bind, and I thought I could do that for them, I have this bind would button right here!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
About level nine, my friends from Realm (who were in their 20's and 30's by then) decided I could leave Greater Faydark (I was still terrified of Orc Centurions at this point) but was so excited to be heading out to see new things!!  I knew where the POD lift was!!<br>
<br>
So, Naeadwen comes and picks me up in Greater Faydark.  He has this BRIGHT yellow robe on, and gives me a turtle shell helm (!!! WOOT!) and off we go.  Get ported into WC by this druid (gawd, I can't wait til I can do that! and SOW!! I wanna do that too!)  <br>
<br>
They decide we're goin to Halas... don't ask me why, hindsight is 20/20.  So, we head off to NK and run thru WK and then QH and into Blackburrow.  EEP!!  I'm laggin so I can't follow very well, and I have my view set wrong (of course, I don't know this) so I can only see the back of my own head.  Anyway, I fall down this pit where there are all these GNOLLS!!  OMG!!  This is worse than orcs, I just know it!!  I'm gonna DIE and lose my shiny shirt and my spiffy turtle helm.  I know!!  I'll turn myself into a tree!!  Took about 40 minutes to get me outa Blackburrow.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
They musta thought I was the most retarded idiot ever to walk Norrath.  I probably was, but this was my early days playing the game, back when it was new and fresh and I couldn't wait until I could do that neato wolfie trick, too!!<br>
<br>
I joined Keepers of the Night when I was big enough to go to LOIO (about lvl 16) and stayed until the guild disbanded.  I then joined Legendary Defenders, where I created Raehn, my now main.  I stayed with the Defenders through all of my 50+ levels, and made some darn good friends!  Hail, Hilamin, Samson, Zzyrrin/Coprinus (gimme da cookies!), Sumnydar, Euqubud, Runikon, Blitzfeld, Koritisergil, Manac (meanie!), Kazzbaa (HEAL!! DAMMIT!), Masumi (omg, yer a guy?! guess I should quit callin ya girly, eh?), Tangient (I love ya, yanno!).  They kept me company and made me laugh and celebrated my success and rescued me when I failed!  <br>
<br>
I remember going down to the bottom of Paw with a pickup group to kill the Ishva (I had a robe fetish and Ishva's robe has CHA!!) and my bf brought his necro with.  We go swimmin down through the bottom of Splitpaw and we're almost there, when BAM! out of nowhere come about 500 gnolls and wipe us all out!  SPLAT!!  We all thought there was a bug in the game, that wasn't supposed to happen!  Someone PETITION!!  Wasn't until a couple days later that my love admits to losing his pet in Paw.  He silently just kept on going, not mentioning the lil fact that his pet was fighting something somewhere and he had no idea where it was.  Well, we laughed AFTER the fact, but I'd a poked him in the eye had I known at the time!  And NOW I'm namin names (KIGER!!) hehehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
That's another story altogether!!  I actually met my IRL BF playing this game.  Now, we share a puter (gads, I hate that) but when we met and before he moved in, we played the game together (usually in tells since he was so much bigger than me and I couldn't dream of hunting in a place like Dreadlands! what's there anyway?)<br>
<br>
Now, I'm in Radiant and I've never had so much fun or laughed so hard!!  These peeps are a FANTASTIC group of misfits! (y'heard me!) and I know there'll be many many more stories to tell, just from this merry band of individuals that I call family!! <br>
<br>
Glad to call Quellious home!!  <br>

He was my first char and my main char until I quit (I think) a couple of months ago.<br>
<br>
I remember at level 8 being asked if I wanted to go to Kerra Isle. I had spent all of my time in either the Swamp or Sro and had no idea of what a port was. I remember appearing in Tox and then swimming to Kerra just terrified. <br>
<br>
I remember being so proud when I made level 10 (double digits).<br>
<br>
I remember joining my first guild (Advocates of Honor ) at level 13 and again feeling very proud. Bostica was the leader and  I remember people like Tashroot and Uglilug being in that guild as well. Then joining PoN (after AoH broke up) , then Council of Arcana (just before PoN broke up) then Lotus Cult.<br>
<br>
Names from the distant past…Loveboat, Salmonella, Wurm (before wurms actually existed),  Tapeworm, Grimblades, Sieran…<br>
<br>
The game is obviously not the same now, everyone knows way too much about EQ and how to play it. While the current game poses a different set of challenges than the early game that sense of the unknown is largely gone. I don’t think any game will give me the same sense of fear and exhilaration than those early days of playing EQ<br>

<br>
And it was! That raid, and the way we turned a terrible mishap (whole temple aggroed) into victory was the most amazing thing I've seen in EQ. We were all battered as hell, LOM, half the raid dead, and here comes every Amy in existence. <br>
<br>
Our MT and OT were both fighting unbuffed with rez effects and I doubt there was a caster with mana in the place. It got so bad that I was primary healer as a 51 shaman =P<br>
<br>
Then when we saw Rhes roll by with like 11 Amy's on him, the most amazing thing happened. Instead of people scattering and calling for evacs, everybody was hooting and calling for the rangers to start peeling the Amys off him =)<br>
<br>
I was so proud to be in MC that day (and allied with our mates in Lor Mani and Dragosn of St George, as they had people there too). What an awesome day.<br>

Still love PoF to this day as a result. Thanks for bringing that story up, bro!<br>
