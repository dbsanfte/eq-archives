All right. Opalmoon <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> and friends</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> posted with a good word. I'd still have my reservations about people sticking up for me. It makes me feel incompetent instead of wanted or cherished.<br>

&quot;Droz and Keluli...hmm I find it funny that it doesn't matter what a person is like, doesn't matter what you tell them about a person, it's the connections they have. I'd say, Keluli had a damn good one.&quot;<br>

Hon, no matter how justified you are in disliking, or even hating others for what they do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> in a game</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, what they do after hours is absolutely <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> none</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of your business. It's nobody's business but you crossed that line.<br>

I don't question the truth of your accusations. To be honest, I don't really care.

you've known me for a long time and  that I was still friends with Marklar.  and ya he has an Ego the size of Ragefire himself  but I always thought eventualy I could mend things between you two,,,  time heals all wounds. <br>
( well I thought they did till this mess).<br>
That man has driven me to tears on more than one occasion.<br>
he invited me into MK those, ( wow it has been  that long!) 3 years ago.  <br>
I remember you  leaving and I didnt play EQ for 2 days I was  shook so bad over it. <br>
figured all you wanted was a few days to figure out what was breaking your heart in MK.<br>
then  the following day I logged on and clicked my friends button, and both you and avis were listed in AoI. <br>
It stung but I figured you found a new home and was happy.<br>
I was glad you found a place to heal.<br>
<br>
then that evening  Marklar sent a tell that he needed a friend to talk too, as he left VoR over some mess with Legolez.<br>
always thought the folks at VoR were super nice. <br>
(hello all you happy Spork people <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
I also saw had you torn completly out of MK and into a new guild and as an officer in it to boot.<br>
and another friend of 3 years  guildless.<br>
I told him I would not  just invite him,  what I did was tell him to come through the initiation process and if everyone voted him in  we would be more than welcome to accept him in.<br>
<br>
a week and a half went by,,  both of you still AoI<br>
still no tell to me, the trusted friend, that you were returning.<br>
I figured if one friend left MK and the other was without guild,<br>
why not tell him to give the recrutment thingy a try.<br>
<br>
you and avis both for that matter have stuck up for me more than once, as has marklar on many occasions. I still miss ya. heck when I was sending you the tell about him just getting the Vote back in,  I sent you a tell about 3 seconds after it passed,,, unanimously within the chat room.<br>
<br>
you told me alot of the bad eggs had left MK and it was shaping up and that we would get things right again soon,<br>
then I asked you if you were sitting down, because I Knew this would start something,  but I had hoped to discuss it with you friend to friend before he was Invited back into the guild. <br>
- thats right hun, he wasnt invited in yet on that day the board and the Website went away. he wasnt invited till 2 days after that.<br>
 <br>
was I trying to keep you from comming back?<br>
no, dear I was trying to tell you what was going on.<br>
15 minutes later you were gone,   telling me in your last tell<br>
that you were removing your twinks<br>
I wasnt done asking you if you would chat with me about it, <br>
I was trying to let you know since you had moved on to a new guild and was an officer already in AoI.<br>
I guess im a two faced (meanie) for asking another friend that left to try and come back,  why have both my friends out of guilds,  I didnt think you would come back.<br>
I may play a cleric but Do'nt read minds well. <br>
the next time you were on line I was on IGNORE.<br>
<br>
<br>
the ironic thing is I havent seen Marklar online in over 3 weeks. <br>
<br>
well  opal (yes I almost said sis again)  I still think of you as such, and I truly hope some day you can let the hate go away,  I still love you and Avis both.<br>
well I Love Ari too  but damn it I seem to get stuck in the middle of things because im friends with both and have to choose , one friend over another that I cant do.<br>
<br>
Take care my friend,<br>
and Avis?<br>
I dont think you are a despicable gnome<br>
and wish you and Opal well in Wraith<br>
I'm sure Matt  and you guys are gonna have some fun times.<br>
<br>

We were never officers in AoI who ever told you that lied.<br>
<br>
Bugrom  I called you son once,  You and Avis have had your moments but you guys always seemed to make up .. I think it was your holier that thou attitude about what you wanted from MK and always pulling you tantrums that finally broke the straw on the camels back so to say with your relationship with Avis.  Without you I would not to this day have my epic you pushed me and pushed me to get it we climbed that mountain together and with the help of our friends in MK we succeeded and I seem to remember a lil gnome that put in many hrs at your camp as well as mine.<br>
<br>
Avis did things for you all the time as you did for him .. <br>
<br>
So just think about those things before you go and spout your mouth off about Avis.<br>

Miina = good friend, ear scritches ROCK<br>
<br>
Opalmoon =  Good Friend ~twitch twitch~<br>
<br>
Arianwen = Great person (didn't really get to know you too well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>
<br>
Avis = Friend too (That day in BW was lots of fun)<br>
<br>
Fact is I like you all and to see you guys ripping at each other sucks, what sucks more is to see it happening in such a public forum.<br>
<br>
Hope things can work out, but if they don't I'll call you all friends anyway :P cause I don't give a @#%$ what people say bout this ranger<br>

Something about kittons Ishan.  A kitton pretended to like another one and they got into a cat fight which lead to Keluli disbanding her group and sleeping with Opalmoon I think.<br>

Heh.... Opal one of the things you will have to learn if yer recruiting with one of us ubah guilds is sarcasm.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You also learn that you cannot get ahead in this game without pissing somebody off, no matter what you do.... you cannot advance in this game without some friction with either the people you are &quot;catching up to&quot;, or the people you are &quot;leaving behind&quot;. <br>
<br>
Fortunately as of late the folks at the top end have kept thigns to a minimum, tho you still got random mudslingers and @#%$ disturbers in the peanut gallery. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>
