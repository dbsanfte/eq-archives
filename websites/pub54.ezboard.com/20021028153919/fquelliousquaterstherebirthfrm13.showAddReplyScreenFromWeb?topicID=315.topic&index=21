What's wrong is parents are too busy chasing that bygone dream of living carefree like they used to before they popped a runt, or would rather make more money for a new car and in the meantime let one of the following raise their burden...er I mean kid:<br>
<br>
a. television<br>

CONTRA COSTA TIMES<br>
<br>
WALNUT CREEK - Twelve-year-old Jeffrey Figueroa shot a spitball in gym class last fall.<br>
<br>
Eight months later he became a felon, convicted in juvenile court last week of battery and mayhem for launching the gum wrapper that hit a classmate's eye.<br>
<br>
The pointed projectile injured the 13-year-old severely enough that he needed eye surgery. But Jeffrey and his parents say the act wasn't intentional and doesn't deserve a criminal conviction.<br>
<br>
&quot;We thought the judicial system would do the right thing,&quot; said mom Yvette Figueroa. &quot;There was no intent, no maliciousness. We felt for the victim. Now all the sudden, the tables turned and we feel like the victims.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jeffrey, now 13, and brother Stephen each were charged in December with four felonies: two counts of assault, one of battery and one of mayhem, according to their parents.<br>
<br>
Prosecutors declined to talk about why they filed felony charges in the case, citing juvenile confidentiality laws. The now 14-year-old victim and his family also declined to comment, but their lawyer said the spitball permanently damaged the boy's right eye.<br>
<br>
The &quot;dart&quot; went through the boy's cornea and ripped the lens of his eye in two, attorney Michael Sterrett said. A time delay caused by infection from the spat paper led to the growth of scar tissue before a replacement lens could be implanted.<br>
<br>
&quot;He describes it as looking through a piece of waxed paper,&quot; he said. &quot;His entire life has been changed forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
The incident happened Sept. 5 as a Walnut Creek Intermediate School class lined up for locker assignments. Stephen said he was in the eighth-grade line and saw the boy holding his eye.<br>
<br>
The Figueroas say prosecutors tried to paint Stephen, now 14, as a co-conspirator in the spitting.<br>
<br>
Jeffrey, in another line, fashioned half of a gum wrapper into a pointed projectile and then spit the whole thing out of his mouth.<br>
<br>
It hit the eye of the victim, whom the Times is not naming because he is a juvenile.<br>
<br>
In a school discipline report from the Figueroas, a school official concluded that Jeffrey didn't act with malice.<br>
<br>
After several meetings, officials decided he would spend the year attending one class and taking the rest through independent study, Yvette Figueroa said.<br>
<br>
Charges were filed in December. The confidential three-day trial hearing ended May 7 with a judge's guilty verdict -- the two felonies for Jeffrey and one misdemeanor battery count for Stephen.<br>
<br>
&quot;We thought it was a joke they even brought charges,&quot; said dad Steve Figueroa. &quot;Now I'm sorry I ever chuckled.&quot;<br>
<br>
Although they plan to appeal his conviction, Jeffrey's June 6 sentencing has his parents nervous. The maximum term for mayhem is eight years.<br>
<br>
Deputy district attorney Jim Picco, who leads the Contra Costa District Attorney's juvenile unit, said judges in juvenile cases generally decide among such punishments as probation, juvenile hall, therapy or a combination.<br>
<br>
The worst case scenario for Jeffrey is incarceration in the California Youth Authority, home to kids who fire things more lethal than spitballs.<br>
<br>
&quot;We should be in civil court, not criminal court,&quot; his dad said. &quot;They should be trying to take my house, not my kid.&quot;<br>
<br>
The District Attorney's Office filed the charges, not his client, Sterrett said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think it's correct to say my client supported that. My client told his story,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
The victim and his family will sue in civil court, Sterrett said. But it's the criminal justice system that has the Figueroas worried.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is wrong with being a kid these days?&quot; said Yvette Figueroa. &quot;Some things have just gone too far.&quot;<br>

<br>
Maybe its your fault you silly parents who think you raise your kids all nice 'n' stuff... You discipline them thinking they actually care... you lock them in their rooms for the night and the next day they come out all like &quot;mommy daddy im sorry I wont do it again&quot;... your so gullable~  Kids will be kids with or without the continued and trying hand of the &quot;Parent&quot; there to smack them around...  Anyways your like 'omfg im a good parent because my kid is perfect in every way' WELL GUESS WHAT!?  Your kid aint perfect, he sneaks out in the middle of the night and goes to teh movies with his friends n stuff all while your asleep thinking that spankin' you gave him earlier actually made a difference!<br>
<br>
Its your fault my kids turned out bad... its your fault my kid shot a spitball at some other kid... maybe if your little twit kid wouldnt have been so like &quot;my parents are better than yours n stuff&quot; he wouldnt of got that black eye the other day on the playground...<br>
<br>
You think its discipline?  no way fool... its those 200 dollar shoes you bought your kid thats causing all the problems... sounds to me like you abusers and users out there need to stop the spanking and start the tight spendin'~  quit buying your kids whatever they want... encouraging them that clothes n @#%$ actually matter... hell fuckin live without electricity if you have to~  problems between kids sometimes occur on social level~  I wonder if the spitball children were in the same tax bracket as each other... 50pp says they werent...<br>
<br>
Your so foolish thinking that discipline is the problem when really you dont have a clue in the world.<br>
<br>

<br>
Somehow I knew you'd open your reply like that. I'm not sure how much of your post is a spoof Montague, but yes, I've heard idiotic friends mention having kids to &quot;see what it's like.&quot; Even though these people are in the mid 20's range you'd think they realize having a kid is not like buying a dress and taking it back to the mall if you're not happy with the fit. Maybe if people who are not ready for the responsibilities with raising children didn't have them there would be less to report.<br>
<br>

<br>
&quot;There was an accident at the school today&quot;<br>
<br>
I broke my arm playing &quot;Tag&quot; in 5th grade. I was at the top of a slide and was &quot;jumping&quot; to slide down when the person that was &quot;it&quot; reached out to tag me.  He tagged me mid air, pushed me over a good bit and I missed the slide and &quot;flew&quot; down about 15 feet, breaking my arm.<br>
<br>
The big deal at school was when I came back and he had to come over and apologize, everyone watching. <br>
<br>
Not a lawsuit.<br>
<br>
What lesson does a 13 year old get from a lawfuit from a spitball...none.<br>

As for that article, when I was around 5 or so, a friend of mine and I were playing some version of war with cap guns. This was back when we had toy guns that looked like guns. Not fruity rainbows. After a long gun battle on my grandparents balcony, we ran out of caps and resorted to killing each other with rubber knives. Well, we got a little rough and iI was knocked off the 3rd story balcony. I landed on the grill below with only one foot taking the impact then busted my head on the concrete. I broke several bones in my leg and needed 12 stiches to close my head. I also walked with a limp for 6 years after this. No charges filed, no one went to jail, no one was sued. We were kids being kids. To this day, im still very good friends with the guy who crippled me for years.<br>
<br>
Morale of the story, kids will be kids. If you try to keep them from being kids, they become adults who never had a childhood. Just like David Berkowitz<br>
