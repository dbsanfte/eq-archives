On rampage duty yes I would.   On sustained MT duty I would not.<br>
<br>
For xp grinding or any non-uber encounter I would.<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW my axe does more damage than a bloodfrenzy/blade of carnage combo.   I got it in order to do damage.... it's one of the very very rare  2h weapons that is both top of the line AND warrior usable (most are knight weapons).   <br>
<br>
The only mobs and situations where warriors tank better are ones where you would last 3 seconds without a heal, and a warrior would last 4.  <br>
<br>
Honestly.. an equally big change in monk vs warrior tanking is the mod rod nerf.   A good cheal chain can keep either of us alive against most any mob... they just need to shorten the pause for the monk...    of course then the cheal nerf is an advantage to a monk tank... since once all meele classes can hit 7500 the effectiveness of the cheal chain becomes close to even on all of them.<br>
<br>
Will be different and interesting adjusting to the changes raidwise.<br>

So they get hit less, but take more damage when they do get hit. The monk that was talking about it said it actually evens out.<br>
<br>
I think the mod rod nerf will affect us the most, unless VI does very well with the retuning. I have always hated mod rods, and mana feeding (gogo necro twitch!) though, so Im hoping to see it go away, or at least reduced to emergency only.<br>
<br>
It may be rough for a bit right after the changes, but I have no doubts that whatever they do it will be overcome. None of us got to the level we play at by not being able to adapt and work with what we are given. =) <p><center><img src=http://i.xanga.com/lfanninc/tattlelc.jpg img> <br>

So where the heck is warrior ONLY AA skills that remove the AC softcap, and warrior ONLY AA HP bonus? Those 2 skills could solve just about everything really. Wars would then focus on AC instead of HP then after getting like 8k HP, with the CH nerf anyway. <p><center><img src="http://www.relinpor.com/sigs/zeiksig.jpg">

Goes the Nerf S</span><hr size=1> Zeik  that type of  AA skill would help in a sense  but not resolve the  problem of  aggro control.... With  the current available weapons for most  melee.  Getting  the  Good taunt weaps for a Warrior is  darn hard, being as there are  Very very few  good  taunting weapons in the game.... Where as all the other melee can and do get their  high damage weapons much easier, either because they are tradeable or simply because they drop of much easier to kill mobs... But for <br>
a warrior  only  3 real taunt weapons come to mind....<br>
 Hategiver,Willsapper  and  the warrior epic..  i'm fairly sure there are a couple more out there but i don't have any experience with their &quot;taunt&quot; generation....<br>
  Now then of these  3   Willsapper is prolly easiest to get,  providing 2 things  1)  Vuluk ( spelling) is up and  2nd)  you can get your force to him before one of the larger guilds get there, which can be tough since most of the larger guilds, with the possible of exception of LC,as they seem busy in Vex,<br>
are usually checking  consistently for possible  targets accross the zones....<br>
 A Warriors taunt is either broken  or just plain doesn't work on some mobs....  I rarely ever loose aggro in a single group situation  even using a 2handed weap and having rogues/monks in group...but soon as you add the &quot;average&quot; pally or SK in a raid situation, by this i mean 3 groups plus.  Even after soloing some mobs for 20-30 secs. in pop the pallys who start stunning or the sk's who start lifetapping  and  aggro is gone..  Now granted i dont expect my taunt ability to keep aggro if a caster starts  chain nuking for  1-6k a pop, but against melees it sure would be nice if it worked correctly for a change.<br>
  Now one could contend, that if a warrior taunt always kept him at the top of the list then encounters would be nothing more then hit attack and read a book while the fight goes on... and to some extent i agree our taunt shouldn't be all that, but given  a warriors job is to HOLD aggro and  VI contends they are not gonna upgrade our melee damage then something has got to give...  either we get better taunting weapons, they improve taunt,  pally stuns and sk lifetaps have their aggro lowered or else  Pally/SK  becomes the tank merely because they can HOLD aggro on a much more consistent basis then the  &quot;Average&quot; lvl 60 war and in compariable armor and buffs,  the  AC and HP totals  are really not that differnet.. All in all the only current advantage a warrior has is  the  defensive disc, but hitting that disc without 1st gaining sufficent aggro is akin to turning attack of and  trying to stare the mob down.... because while we take alot less damage we are also dealing even less damage while defensive is active.. Saves on healing mana, but makes the chance of  aggro Pong  alot more likely and  i've rarely ever seen a Pally or SK that got aggro this way turn attack off. they just kept right on swinging  figuring the war  could snatch back aggro.. end result usually being  clerics switched to the pally/sk on heals while the poor war  just fell in with the rest of the pack and beat the Mob from behind... or else the pally/sk died and mob switched to whomever else and jumped the war on the aggro list.<br>
<br>
 Anywaz,  Wars need a improvement in aggro control that isn't related to taunting weaps and that doesn't  as a result lower a pallys or SK's damage output, but i really don't see<br>
what Verant can or will do to help resolve this issue..<br>

That really hurts wizards who finally had something to focus on when choosing gear...  What now will a wizard choose? It kinda sucks for a wizard who used a lot of points or took their turn on loot on a 100 mana item with poor other stats over a 50 mana item with great other stats. <p><center>

Goes the Nerf S</span><hr size=1> Yea, forgot about taunt, but we are talking about the highest end here, since we were talking about monk/SK/Pal tanking and such. There are 3 weapons that proc enraging blow. (hategiver proc) Ratios on all are 15/20, 15/19, and 16/20. A while back rogues were complaining about no weapon to bridge the gap to epic, so quite a few 13-14 damage piercers were put in....<br>
They should put in weapons similiar to hategiver, from easier mobs, ratio's like 13/20, 14/21, etc, things to bridge the gap between something like a Lamentation and Hategiver (to be extreme.)<br>
Also, taunt REALLY needs to be fixed. It works approximately 8% of the time on a red con mob at level 60. It should also be able to um, dunno how to put it, but like, keep adding more Hate if you already have aggro too. That right there would probably be the best warrior solution.<br>
Hell, I was a warrior in DAoC... you taunt once there and you will NOT lose a mob's attention, that's really how it should be.<br>
<br>
Also.... SK spell aggro was nerfed horribly, heh.<br>

I still honestly believe most of you are missing the point , as to what VI's true motives are.... I am of the opinion VI wants to force us to use more people to kill the harder mobs in the game and in essense take skillz out of the equation, where 20 ppl could take down Mob_01 due to mod rods being effective mana regen. Now the same Mob might require 25-30 ppl... <br>
<br>
To everyone whom actually believes the tougher encounters are gonna be appropriately re-tuned... HAHAHAHAHA, boy do i have some land to sell to you.... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yar, this is something I think that is quite true. I notice of the raids that fail, they all suffered from the &quot;not enough&quot; syndrome. Not enough backup healers to keep the MA alive with fast spamheals if the CH rotation cannot keep up with the damage, not enough chanters in place to keep the adds off the healers, not enough off-tanks to hold off re-pops, not enough bodies to put in the DPS before everyone runs out of mana. Taking out out mod-rod mana batteries just makes the mob encounter design easy for Verant. X number of clerics healing Y tanks * raid DPS &gt; Mob HP (+ Regen) * Mob DPS = Victory. Anything that breaks the formula is labelled an exploit and invites the wrath of the nerf bat in this case.* <br>
<br>
And a big fracking naff to anyone gullible enouff to swallow the idea that the present uber mob encounters will become easier. IMHO, They are all still doable without mod rods. Just this time the X # of people is increased by a huge amount. The thing is, I expect after the initial zerg raids, most guilds will adjust to this (and with the increasing # of level 65 players), will develop new tactics to own the mobs with less people (and starting the nerf cycle anew).<br>
<br>
BYTW, Necros aren't going to be able to take up the slack (well not unless you zerg rush with a squadron of necros too). Their mana infusions are way too inefficient to keep up with the demands of cleric CH cycle. I would think with this nerf, mages have an even more annoying job than the necros. In fact the new idea of mages summoning mod rods into the inventory is the most contrived kludges that I have ever seen in the game!<br>
<br>
PS:<br>
* Don't get me started about Verants inability to recognize the fact that player tactics &gt; whatever they can think off, hence rewarding ingenuity with nerfs). One day, I won't be surprised, a design document will leak out of Verant. It will just be something like this:<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;X mob = Y groups needed, must have Z clerics in raid. <br>
Please ban if there is less.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
