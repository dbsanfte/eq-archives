According to Siri two people who I'd consider friend are complete liars.  They dont even know each other but coincidentally they told me the same exact story before I even brought any knowledge I had of the incident up.  Sorry but I'm not going to believe Siri over two friends who have never given me a reason not to believe them.  One of them actually used to pal around with Siri and you know it would be pretty sad to have your own friends spreading lies about you.  The other is someone I've known for quite some time, who's always been around to help me when I need it and who I help out in return when he needs it.  So we have these two people who are blatant liars by their past actions towards me and then we have Siri.  I think that character comparison doesn't leave much to the imagination.<br><br>Sorry Siri, that's just not quite as good as the rest of the stories you come up with, I think you should try another.  Let's try something like &quot;the GM's didn't ban me but they recommended I stop eq for a while and out of the goodness of my heart I stopped to avoid problems&quot;.  That's much more in character with the kind of thing you'd do, wouldn't you say?  If you really did have complete control over your account then why didn't you just ebay it?  You know you woulda gotten a kick out of seeing some poor sap inherit your rep and making some money on the deal.  I guess it's kind of hard to ebay characters that don't even have access to the servers eh?  <br><br>Seriously Siri, if you take solace in trying to make me look like a fool know that I take solace in the fact that I'll never have to put up with you again.  If you honestly did cancel your account then /cheer to you for ditching your guild so soon after you got your epic.  You got what you needed from them and decided there was no reason to stick around and help them out any longer.  Explaining how your guild is your family and you treat them differently than the random player and you'd never treat them bad blah blah blah is not supported by randomly cancelling your account.  There is one big question that needs to be answered though.....  If this other game is so good that you'd quit eq for it what are you doing still checking out EQ message boards?<br><br>Salta<br>Phantasmist<br>LC<br><br>GNOME! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uauggust.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Auggust</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/25/01 10:21:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: right....</span><hr size=1> ROFLMAO  Colach  hehehhe <p><html><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=5316">---Inventory---</a><br><img  src="http://worldzone.net/themes/azyn//augsiga.jpg"><br><a href="http://worldzone.net/themes/azyn//sigs.shtml">---Other Siggies---</a></center></html></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sirina>Sirina</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/25/01 12:41:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Let's just leave Siri alone...</span><hr size=1> First of all the reason I came to this board is because I was told by a real life that, yet again, you are giving another pathetic attempt to start @#%$ with me.

Thanks for telling us you have no point.<br><br>2) Who are these &quot;people&quot; you speak of?  Yeah thats what I thought.  Sorry, the old &quot;this person&quot; and &quot;that person&quot; said this and that wild card doesnt work any more.  You merely got busted for believing a rumor and now are trying to back it up with false info.<br><br>3) Why didnt I ebay?  Lets think about it.  Number 1 money isnt everything to me.  Number 2 I dont want her running around with &lt;Vis Maior&gt; or &lt;Lotus Cult&gt; over her head, mainly because of people like you.<br><br>4) You basically said &quot;Yeah right you just got your epic&quot;.  Thank you for proving another thing about you, loot is basically everything to you.<br><br>In closing I have no hard feelings toward *anyone* I have run into in the past.  This is a game and some of you just need to realize that.<br><br>I hope you all have fun sitting on your asses for hours upon hours in Ntov.<br><br>-Sirina<br><br>PS: Salta, I truly hope one day that you maturity level grows beyond that of a 13 year old.

Livup and you seemed to get along quite well anytime I ran into you so why would your partner in crime purposefully spread false rumors about you?  If those are the kind of friends you have then I do pity you.  Livup has no reason to lie to me, he has no reason to lie about you, so why are these nasty rumors getting started?  Zippers' main has been a friend of mine for quite some time.  He knows I'd help him or anyone in his guild at the drop of a hat, I suppose he just made up a story to randomly tell me one day eh?  So now you may come back and attempt to discredit their character in some way rather than looking at the points that have been made.<br><br>Much in the same way you turned the loot thing around on me.  Making a point about you leaving the game right after you got your epic has nothing to do w/ me and my views on loot.  I'm not the one who raised hell over a silly little belt and if loot was as important to me as you say, my rl/online friends certainly wouldn't be decked out in the gear they are and I'd have a bit more than 1kpp in the bank.  I can't remember the last time I bought anything besides peridots but maybe you see peridots as uber loot and that's all I seem to care about /shrug.<br><br>As far as LC goes they are the greatest collection of people I've ever had the pleasure of online gaming with.  You honestly don't know enough about me to judge my whole guild over &quot;people like me&quot;.  I personally wouldn't see a &lt;Lotus Cult&gt; tag flying over anyone's name as a disgrace.  And don't you think it's just a little cocky on your part to think your character with your rep would get into any respectable guild (not just lc/vm) even if it was ebayed?  I never said you would ebay solely for cash, I said your spiteful nature would indicate that you would do something along those lines to get a laugh.  However you may interpret and respond to what I said in any way you wish.  You seem to enjoy pointing out how people claim things they never actually said (much like how I proved loot is everything to me by making a comment about you).  <br><br>Now please proceed to tell me about my horrible friends who lie to my face about things that dont make a difference in the world to them.  And let me know when you're ready to grow up with me and we can learn to be mature together!  I mean isn't killing bankers just to harrass people the epitomy of maturity?

Yes I know Livup doesn't exactly act &quot;intelligently&quot; all of the time but again why would I ever choose to not believe something he said if he's never lied to me before.  You point out I must be desperate to believe someone like Livup but who's the one desperate enough to have friends that lie about them?  And why would a completely different friend of mine lie to me about being told by a GM that you were going to quite possibly be banned based upon further review?  Funny how &quot;coincidentally&quot; your cancelling account ties into the stories of banning.  It's comparable to a boss threatening to fire an employee but the employee pipes up and announces that he quits.  Same result in both cases, just someone trying to come off looking better.  We'll just chalk that up to extremely unlucky timing... just like anytime you &quot;happened&quot; to train someone and be laying FD right next to the people being trained.  <br><br>I spent more than half my time in previous guilds helping people get epics, killing random mobs here and there.  I could probably do quite a few other class' epics based on my experiences killing friend's mobs alone.  I attained level 60, I've killed everything there is to kill w/out the support of a really decent guild, what was there left for me to do?  /cheer Siri for making an incredibly ignorant and stereotypical claim on my motivations for guilding.  <br><br>And you ask me if I bother reading your posts when I basically responded to it point by point.  Sorry if you still have trouble w/ reading comprehension at this stage in your life.  With that I'll leave my &quot;last ditch effort to save my pride and get in the last word in a flame over the game&quot; (a comment which funnily enough was made by you in your attempt to do the same exact thing).  Sorry I misspelled something in a post as well, I dont take the extra 5 minutes you may to read over a post once I'm done with it.  <br><br>Since you'll never post again I really dont expect an answer but why were you in RIP if you can have just as much fun outside a power guild?  You can't deny that RIP is capable of killing quite a few things so this means you, by your own definition, are a loot whore?  Good riddance to you and all your &quot;incredibly coincidental happenings&quot;.<br><br>As for Gaelron, I dont dislike you, I just think you're a complete idiot who hardly ever makes sense.<br><br>Salta<br>Phantasmist<br>LC <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucolach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Colach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/25/01 7:03:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /sigh again</span><hr size=1> SALT CHECK YOUR EMAIL FS FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS<br><br>btw heh sirinab if your not banned why don't you log on one last time and say tell one of the people flaming you here?<br><br>SALTA IS A NEWB  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/26/01 5:31:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: /sigh again</span><hr size=1> Salta i like you.. even though you enjoy flaming me.<br><br>I don't have a slanted view on uber guilds personally I perfer to be involved in building ubers guilds from stratch..<br><br>I can't speak on Sirinab's view of uber guilds cause I don't agree with it..<br><br>as for stopping posting a while ago..
