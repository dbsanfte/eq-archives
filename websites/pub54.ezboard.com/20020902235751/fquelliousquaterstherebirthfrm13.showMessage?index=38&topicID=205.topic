Dude... you really shouldnt have crawled out from under your rock, cause now your ass is mine!&quot;<br>

Lol, dude, i have a idea, shut the @#%$ up.<br>
As for the Droz thing man, you probably wouldnt understand because your too busy logging off eq every 15 minutes to &quot;see the new l33t flames&quot; or trying to make a flawless attempt at posting something rude about another person too boost your morale because you are dickless. When your trying to controll 40+ people at a time over the high end game of eq, you probaly not gonna have time to bend someone over your knee and spank them like your thier father or something over some  petty @#%$ that happened in a homosexual ghetto zone like sebilis. Reporting @#%$ to peoples guildleaders is so..pre kunarkish. Grow the @#%$ up, And cut the dumbass  guilt by association @#%$ that seems to run rampid on quellious. When desi said this post had nothing to do with your topic (and he was right by the way) you said nah this isnt that big of a thing that it needs its own topic or something, well in this topic where you posted your whiny bitchy @#%$ you have managed to post 4-5 times, not to mention all the times people replied to your ever so bitchathon. Posting here about droz also shows your manhood, I for one never come to these boards, and can tell  ya droz will never come either. Its the same @#%$ over and over again just cut/paste where the names and guild tags should be.<br>
<br>
As for VM thing, I myself think both parties were in the wrong. I myself pulled Myga the first time, had it solo, and somehow i turn around and myga is running the other way, i look and guess who is kiting myga now, Tanja ;P<br>
Another thing i have noticed is the majority of the people that are complaning from vm's side on our webpage and this one are newbie vm members, shrug, this may not mean anything to anyone else but maybe they think defending thier new guild makes them a better guildy or something? who knows, all you oldies know me to be a fair and balanced person, who fights for the flag he stands under.<br>
Simple discussion could have prevented this all.<br>

Main Entry: con·de·scend <br>
Pronunciation: &quot;kän-di-'send<br>
1 a : to descend to a less formal or dignified level <br>
<br>
From Dictionary.com<br>
con·de·scend <br>
To descend to the level of one considered inferior; lower oneself<br>
<br>
I think I used it correctly and just like I intended to. If I am incorrect I would like to know how so I dont repeat the mistake in future. Honestly, no smart retorts intended. I think my usage was correct, what are you referring to ?<br>

Thanks for the flame.  Keep at it, and maybe one of these days your posts will show a slight bit of originality.<br>
<br>
Now... let's get serious for a moment.  I will not dispute your thoughts on Guild Leadership, cause we are all entitled to an opinion.  But... I will share my views with you.<br>
<br>
As a Guild Leader, it is my responsibility to see to the needs of the folks who have entrusted me to lead them.  Additionally, it is my responsibility to see that they behave within our Charter, and also that they act responsibly within the Quellious EQ community.  Folks within Lor Mani are carefully chosen... not by level or class... but by their attitude, and their fit within the LM family.  And yes... we are not perfect.  As much as I cringe saying it, we at one time or another had Backs, Lifeguard, and even Tactics listed amongst our ranks.  Ooops.  Needless to say, these lapses in judgement were quickly rectified.  <br>
<br>
The point here is that I (and every LM Guild Leader before me) has taken a very devout pride in this guild, and in our reputation.  I hold my myself to exceptionally high standards of decency, morality, and ethical conduct... and by my example, I try to inspire my guildmates, and friends to do the same.  <br>
<br>
I do not claim to be perfect, and I know that I have a significant number of character flaws... and here's the biggest one... an almost complete lack of tolerance of people with no code of ethics (or those that run counter to mine).  I honestly have a hard time dealing with people like Tada... who steal camps and then train people.  I also have a hard time with dealing with people like Droz... people in a position of power and authority who care more for their phat lewts than they do about the actions of their members, or their reputation within the community.  In earlier posts, I was accused of spamming him with tells, and basically written off as some idiot who couldnt possibly comprehend what it takes to run 40+ people.  Well... to set the record straight, I specifically asked Droz if he had a moment, and he said yes.  I'm not sure what color the sky is in your world... but when I hear that someone has time, they hmmm... how do I say this... oh yeah... they have time.  When he told me that he had time, I took the time to let him know what was happening.  Period.  I was then effectively ignored.  Am I taking the high road here?  Yep.  When Lor Mani officers are confronted with issues concerning LM members, I am notified and I get information on the issues, deal with them, then follow up with the outside parties.  What I do NOT do, is blow people off by telling them to go talk to a GM.<br>
<br>
Tada, Droz, Desi, bla bla bla... you may not like me as a person, and that is your choice to make, and well within your rights.  I care not.  What I care about is coming home after a hard day's work, logging onto my computers, and spending a fun evening with my online family and friends.  I love them, and I look out for them.  And when people like Tada ruin their gaming experience, I stand up for them... because I am their GL, and that is my job... and becuase they are my friends... and that is what I do for my friends.  And when they are wronged, I first try to resolve the issues through talking to officers in the perp's Guild, and if that doesnt help, I usually am more than happy to vent here.<br>
<br>
As far as this issue goes, it's over imo.  I've said my piece, and vented my frustration.  When I logged on to QQ2 this morning to see a Torros post... one with Wraith next to his name... I just wrote off Wraith as a guild.  Sorry Alver, and sorry Aminos.  I wish you two the best, and I and the rest of Lor Mani will always be at your side in a time of need... but other than that, I will simply avoid Wraith and be done with it.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day. <p><center>

The defininition you gave and the way your used it conform to the usage for descend, condescend means - (From Collins) [Prep] ..to behave in such a way to show that you are superior to them. eg he never condescended, or spoke down to me. in the to do sense condescend means you believe you were doing someone a favor when it is plain you are not. <br>

p.s. from your websters source - the way you used it this applies which is why it made no sense 2 : to assume an air of superiority. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufkin6666.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fkin6666</A> at: 2/27/02 1:36:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontaguethesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montague the Sorcerer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(2/27/02 1:42:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=50>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: We all worship Quellious.</span><hr size=1> Edit: Nevermind, question has been answered! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontaguethesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montague the Sorcerer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/27/02 1:44:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utadathewarlock60.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TadaTheWarlock60</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(2/27/02 3:08:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Mr. Quas</span><hr size=1> Dear the group that wanted chef,<br>

Btw thx Desaran/Tenalin, MY ass isn't yours and it wont be because i'm not gay, stop picking a fight you can't win and go back to sebilis and pull your chef camp you wanted cuz i can care less, you are simply a 12 year old that likes to be immature and have everything your way or you bitch...Stop playing EQ till you turn 18 years old and aren't jailbate anylonger and have hit pubrity (did i even spell that right?) and then ask yourself, &quot;Am i man enuff to play such a mature game filled with a lot of immature people like myself?&quot;...You probably don't understand that question and i realize i'm wasting my time, lata<br>

Are you like the speaker for VM or you just go around yelling stuff out of the top of your head and try to make VM worse? After reading all your posts thats the question that hit me the most...My Advise to vm is to keep Mont from posting as a VM member, kinda hurts you..<br>

Shows what ya know Mont.  Are you new to the server/high end game on quell? (serious question....not going to get into crap that will just fan more bullshit here.. but really... I suspect at least you were not around 6 months ago or so, or are just trolling at this point)<br>
<br>
This is all stupid.  We got trained and lost a Myga to VM, both sides were in a rush cuz of imminent server downtime.  Both sided acted hostile at the time.  In game it was dealt with on both sides, it's a dead issue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uzyonveeshanbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zyon Veeshanbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(2/27/02 3:35:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hrm...</span><hr size=1> I like cheese.<br>

I'll be sure to explicitly say /anon next time so you don't get the wrong idea.  I'm only stating my opinions - which is what I thought the &quot;Flame Board&quot; was for... I might could understand your arguement if this was in the general section, but its not.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Why I think all you Wraith people are puppets:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
You are followers.  You don't think for yourself - Most of the replies to the large collection of threads on this issue are by Wraith members that weren't even there.  They simply believe what they are told.<br>
<br>
PS. Your right, I did include my signature in one of my posts, sorry I forgot to uncheck the box... It has been corrected.<br>
<br>
And no, i'm not the speaker of vis, i speak for myself.<br>
<br>
<br>
And.....<br>
Your right, this is a dead issue... Biffins and I both talked for a long while the night of the confrontation and we both had a good understanding of each other's view points, and I even appologized to Biffins for all the confusion and what not this has caused.<br>
<br>
This isn't about Myga anymore, Its now turned into just general flames to each other, which I must say, is after all what this forum is for. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontaguethesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montague the Sorcerer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 2/27/02 3:58:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uiuldiin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Iuldiin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=Blue>Admin</font><br>/\/00bie</span><br>  Posts: 203<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(2/27/02 4:00:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=205.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hrm...</span><hr size=1> Go Zyon!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=88020">
