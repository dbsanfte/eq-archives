I have never Ks'ed intentionally, I have never walked over anyone's raid - whilst I have my enemies (in the loosest sense of the word) , I would actually like to say Trex is a nice guy.  <br>
<br>
No, I am not on Trex's side he has faults just like everyone else does, Hell even I have faults - not many granted (hehe), but we are all human behind the toon and things &quot;£!&quot; us off to a certain degree.  <br>
<br>
Anyways.....swiftly moving back to Trex.  He worked hard to organise raids and I helped him from time to time and vice versa, especially in the Euro raid times.  What we did together in the times of QQ was to allow people the opportunity to raid at reasonable times.  It was me that put the idea into Trex's head about organising Planes raids - we alternated it...He ran Fear, I ran Hate - whereas he took most of the dragon raids because I was simply too high to get involved.  So yes, Trex arranged Fear - but that was nothing to do with greed, he knew Fear far better that what I did<br>
<br>
Now what people do not understand is the pressure of pulling 30-40 people to a raid, all from varying guilds, saying yes to some and no to others - its a pain in the ass and its also saddening that you cannot show any kind of biased as to friend invites or whatever - it was always a first come first serve basis.  <br>
<br>
Trex was always pretty strict when it comes to raids, but it was for the better of the raid.  Because the raids were run as such, both me and Trex did not know many of you so we did not know how many times you have been to planes, naggy etc - so by offering to port you out if you dont listen is not childish to threaten to boot you out.  <br>
<br>
After all.......who really wants a raid wipeout because some Warrior is going for a walk in Hate, or someone decides to make a pet and not destroy it.  <br>
<br>
Does anyone ?  <br>
<br>
Even I sent tells to people who I thought were acting inappropriately to help the raid more than anything else run smoothly.  If they persisted, then I would say please gate out/or we will get you ported out.  Again for the better of the raid<br>
<br>
Trex was and is a good guy and I will defend him until I am blue in the face...Like I said he had his faults, sure he left KC in an innappropriate fashion, he has left EQ 2 times prior to this one, he could sometimes be agressive in the way that he worked - but he had ambition to deliver to 30-40 people in a raid and he worked DAMN hard at it <br>
<br>
Of all those people that attended the euro raids in Fear or Hate, how many were successful ??? 90% + ? <br>
<br>
Is that unfair ??? <br>
<br>
On our last euro outing before the demise of QQ, we did Hate - anyone remember ? well out of those 3 raids we killed 3 Maes - that is a succesful raid that Trex was in the centre of........<br>
<br>
So before comment at Trex's weak points also look at his strong points - look at your weaknesses and strong points - we all have them.  <br>
<br>
Peace out<br>

<br>
I think its silly to have a 15post thread half-bashing Trex, then a 15post thread sticking up for him. Neither is needed really. With that disclaimer lemme say..<br>
<br>
I figured out quite quickly that Trex isnt everybody's best friend, but I can tell you He has never done me wrong, in fact, quite the opposite, my only real encounter with the man I see everywhere, was at my only Naggy raid that I have ever gone on, and will ever probably. He made that a very enjoyable experience, as he was leading the raid. And I even screwed up at end and got myself killed trying to leave sol-b without a port. I dont need to repost what all was done, but between him, and 3 other friends of mine, my body was gotten and res'ed. And he didnt take off, or say &quot;sorry, you're sol&quot;, he didnt even know me, but since I was on his raid, he took it upon himself (I didnt ask, he instead insisted) to help me. And he died trying ot help me. <br>
<br>
<br>
ANYways, I'm just saying, that Yah, Trex isnt a horrible guy, or even close. He just has his friends, and has his enemies, not much in between. <br>
<br>
<br>
Greatful for Trex's help 10 levels and 3 months ago, <br>
