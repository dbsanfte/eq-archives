Almost every other spawn for epics is in a set spot and if you pop up to that spot you can just snag a place in line or come back later and check.  Without a tracker Quillmane is a bitch as everyone is racing to try to get him when he pops.  Yeah Yeah he can bring a tracker but some people feel like they are wasting others time to make them sit in zone trying to track for something the whole time even if the friends are more then willing.<br>
<br>
I think Masten has realized the mistake of naming a person in this whole ordeal but sometimes it makes a flame have more of a point because you arent generalizing.  Thats great that Kaesha(sp)  is so helpful to people, at least a good person is getting a good item.  Epics are the source of much hatred and frustration as Verant did not think them out very well.  That is why it is so important that a server does not create an enviroment of bitching and moaning.  I think the Ragefire list is great if EVERYONE respects it as I think they will or they will face the whole community.<br>
<br>
It really comes down to personal feelings here.  You all would be screaming holy hell if some person was camping an item you needed for an epic.  I was on probably 6-7 vox raids and not once did I EVER even think of rolling on the White Scale as I thought that a bard getting their epic was way more important as a whole then me getting that white cloak.  Levitation is a great spell/ability but is it really worth holding up someone for their epic?  <br>

It's Kaesha's business to camp what she wants.<br>
<br>
Did she KS masten?   Did she insult Masten like he insulted her?  Did she rub her cloak in his face and laugh at him when she got it?  Or did she put her own time in to camp an item, and Masten is just flaming her for it cuz after she put in the camp time she didn't hand it over to him?<br>

Twice I had the f***er try to sell it to me after KS'ing HA! <br>
<br>
But one thing I know, until Verant decides to do a change like they did with the white scale, that cloak is pretty much up for grabs to anyone who wants it. Tough luck, deal with it, camp it again or either get desperate and pay some bastard a lot of pp because if you don't get it you'll kill yourself or moan enough to get a free MQ. Or do like me, arm yourself with patience, try and try again and know you are still as great a mage without your epic as you'd be with it *shrug* Getting it should be a goal, not the definition of who you are in game. We already have too many crappy players who MQ'ed their way to their epic, have thousands of plat in gear on their backs (not to mention the PL) and still suck big time.<br>

<br>
This quest, much like many others in the game, was poorly thought out in my opinion.  Any quest item required by one class, but made desirable by several, doesn't seem too smart.  The fix for this one is extremely simple, but as long as we all pay our monthly fees it, like all the rest, will never be corrected.  I think they should either not require mages to get this item to gain thier epic,or fix it as follows.<br>
<br>
1)  Make it mage only-This is an outstanding item.  Any kind of lev is great for a melee at any level and a free lev is also nice for lazy casters, myself included.<br>
<br>
2) Make it non MQable-This requires the mage to work for it themselves as well as not allowing Greedybastard_01 to bend you over and give you a good 40K screwing.<br>
<br>
Ok, bitch at me now and tell me how wrong I am.<br>

Like the Bards' White Scale was... this portion of the Mage Epic is fought over way to much... And if Verant is sincere about helping solve the epiec-items-being-fought-over-by-multiple-classes dellima, they should consider an alternative to the quillmane portion of the Magician's epic.   The only way that this can be brought to their attention is if enough players /feedback it.  So please, when you are online, support Quellious's dissapearing Magician populous and /feedback for a change to the Mage's Quillmane cloak portion of their epic. <br>

Lets face it, you should probably power lvl a ranger up to about lvl 20 and put all his skills into tracking.   Only people that should have an advantage over you are druids, bards, and rangers so I don't see a big problem if joe blow cleric gets a cloak before a mage.<br>
<br>
I mean lets face it warriors can't port,  wizards can't heal, and mages can't track.   Life sucks  but I'm sure you all will become epic someday.<br>

My mistake with my original post was in only naming one of the many epic players who counter camp Quillmane too Mages.<br>
My complaint was about epic holders, who having received help from other classes to obtain their epic, by their actions making it harder for Mages to obtain their epic.<br>
I had no idea that Kaesha had got Quills cloak until it was mentioned on the flameboard.  I never demanded that she leave or give me the cloak if it dropped - I just find it difficult to accept that just because an item is nice or has a desirable effect that people would actively attempt to deny epic drops too other player's.<br>
I don't demand rolls on other classes epic pieces when they are all/all and drop while Im in a raid party and Im sure most of the people here spouting the all/all argument would scream blue murder if I or others did.  Applying the all/all argument too one piece only out of the many nice all/all epic drops is just convenient to justify the situation and show's a basic flaw in the argument <br>
