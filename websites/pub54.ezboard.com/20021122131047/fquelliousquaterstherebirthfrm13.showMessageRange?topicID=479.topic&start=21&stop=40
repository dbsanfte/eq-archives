secondly, maybe because of what happened with avis and opal right here on these boards you could possibly fathom a logical reason why it wouldn't be in the best interest of the guild to allow you access?  ya...just think a second and maybe you will realize why bugrom didn't give you access.  good job<br>

<br>
The reason that MK started a new message board was because all the posts were deleted from the old one. Moderator powers were used to completely nuke the old board. That sort of killed any trust for ex-members with moderator powers. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There are a lot of messed up things that go on in this game. Stupid fights over stupid things and old grudges over stupid things that can't seem to be resolved due to personality conflicts or whatnot. Can we just agree to disagree?<br>
<br>
Why keep twinks in the guild if it's not good enough for your main, that seems kind of like saying that the guild isn't worth your serious time, only good enough for dinking around. Doesn't exactly inspire confidence nor portray the member who does this as someone who can be counted on. I have no grudge against you Gabby, you've never offended me personally, but MK is no longer Opal's guild, she passed leadership on by her own choice. She moved on to other things, bigger and better things from her guild tag. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I sincerely hope that she's found new joy in this insane game.<br>
<br>
After this outburst we would have to be fools to allow access to the private sections of the board. You've done nothing but insult the remaining members. Granted, they did some insulting back. It's painful to see people I respect flinging verbal feces at each other. Please just leave this thread be, handle it in game. I know that this board loves nothing more than a good drama, but there isn't any manaburn or ragefire in this thread so can we please let it die.<br>
<br>
This could have been handled in game more easily and may have been the result of a misunderstanding or technical error of some type. While we would not have been exposed to a couple amusing yet insulting pics, it would have been a lot less painful.<br>

<br>
First of all i was NEVER banned from MK ....EVER ..not by you ..not by oapl ..not by avis/stawker.<br>
<br>
I left on my own after lots of bullshit goin on from two peeps in the guild ..namely you and opal.<br>
<br>
I left for exactly the same reasons that maiti and aidiene and mattrix and the gang left ..we were tired of all the shit coming down from you two.<br>
<br>
And i dont know where you get this banned twice from MK shit ..as i was never banned even the first time.<br>
<br>
SECONDLY there are still people playin that witnessed the stunt that was pulled in traks teeth regarding the seb key that nite (the nite that i left the guild).   And as both witnesses are in leadership positions of Healers United ..id be real real careful about how you tell that story ..as their recollections are a LOT different than yours, and not only myself ..but they are also pissed at yas over the stunt pulled that nite.  <br>
<br>
THIRDLY ive never badmouthed MK ....ive always stated that i loved the guild ..and the fact that im a member now should bear that out ...my beef with MK has always been you two ..<br>
<br>
On several occasions ..such as for miinas and bugs epic ..ive came to help those two ..my personal friends  ...and you and opal both pack up and leave when i arrive ..unwilling to put aside your personal gripes ..your rather harm your own guild ..just to slight me .....HOW CHILDISH<br>
<br>
And i STILL remember the incident you pulled when raidin with my guild in kael arena ..we started portin in our peeps to join ..and once i arrived you went off half-cocked and threatened to leave if i was allowed to raid with my OWN guild.<br>
As you were one of only two clerics on that raid at the time ..it put my guild in an awful predicament ..and i ended up not attendin to not ruin the raid.<br>
<br>
FOURTHLY ...i waited at least a week (and i REALLY believe more but for the sake of argument ill say one week) for both you and opal to be gone from MK before i applied for MK.<br>
<br>
From there it was 2 MORE weeks before they let me in ...you see ..even tho i was UNANIMOUSLY approved by the officers (many of whom were officers when i was originally MK ..and know the bs you two started about me isnt true) ...I had to wait longer than anyone else to get in ..simply because of the past friction weve had in the past....they gave you EVERY opportunity to rejoin before makin the decision to invite me ..you simply chose to take it ..<br>
<br>
SO we have at LEAST a 3 week period from the time you left to the time i was invited ..not TWO DAYS as you claim ...and either you ..opal or avis/stawker deleted our web board the day i was first invited ..so if you have any questions as to the exact date i was invited ..all one has to do is look there ..and its a LOT more than two days after you two left.....<br>
<br>
You lie and you lie BLATANTLY<br>
<br>
The fact that our web board &quot;mysteriously&quot; vanished with one of you 3 bein the ones to hold the pass key ..and the fact that you continually post here blasting MK members,  is it any wonder why you didnt have access to the private sections of our board?  <br>
<br>
And FINALLY, ive remained very quiet regarding the problems between us ...we dont get along ..and i see no reason to let it go farther than that ..you dont like me ..i dont like you ..<br>
<br>
This is between us two ..if you have a problem with me ..take it up with me personally, stop draggin this TWO YEAR OLD MESS into the public.  Its damn childish and frankly its no one elses business.  If you truly care about MK even half as much as you claim too ..then youll stop slinging mud publicly and shut the hell up about this ...all your doin is lookin like an ass and pissing everyone the hell off ....and causing problems for MK (a guild you claim to love)<br>
<br>
This has totally gotten out of hand and is fuggin ridiculous.<br>

I gave you a second chance and you fucked it up..so dont go blaming the shit on anyone else. <br>
<br>
As far as the Kael raid went...I just stated that I would have to leave, I didnt elaborate, because I choose not to be in the same raid with you is my own damn decision to make not anyone elses, and if you dont like it tough shit!<br>

Trinks, Gabby, Avis  ,Opal  fresh from  CoA to join her, Maiti,Adoc, Treefox,Jaynia (gack it was so long ago.. and a few others. )<br>
by the time I Joined in  (invited by Marklar btw) there were about 35 of us, - somewhere by years end  Lots of stuff happened and Marklar was gone - wont go any further into that.<br>
he went his way we went ours and we grew  to over a hundred folks. still trying to maintain the family guild.<br>
- 2 years go by and now we have the current set of events weve been going around with for 2 months.<br>
- that should bring ya all up to speed on things.<br>
<br>
With 90% of the family guilds out there as one of my guildies, Mocean put it. it starts with friends, then friends of friends. then friends of friends of friends.   well by this point the 3rd generation of people have no idea who the first generation people are.<br>
<br>
Problem is the Third generation people have diffrent ideas for a guild and eventualy they either leave,  or change what they have ( and it almost always gets changed)<br>
I can think of a few older guilds that are gone that also fit this description.<br>
<br>
MK isnt what it was. I have and Bugrom and most of the officers we have now are  trying very hard to get it back there.<br>
but its a hard battle to fight, some people dont want it changed back,  some do.  People want the Raids and the Loot and the stuff to make THEM better, not to just have fun and be a family. its something that WE are dealing with and WILL.<br>
thats ok I guess for some people but its not Us.<br>
<br>
I had a nice day with Opal AND Gabby about 2 weeks ago in Seru and we made up and tried to put this behind us.<br>
<br>
Opal, Gabby?  sis, please accept my sincerest heartfelt sorrow  your guild has become something diffrent of what it once was. It doesnt make us evil or bad people. <br>
<br>
Im sure many folks around Quellious have seen their ranks Swell recently with our family that has left.<br>
please welcome them they are super people.<br>
<br>
its the Eleventh Hour for us right now, and we will either come out of this stronger and close again.  or we will end up packed and notched on the shelf next to ADD.<br>
<br>
Gabby  I love ya sis  (Hugs)<br>
send me a tell anytime.<br>
I think most of the people here (most) are trying to use humor to add levity to some rocky times.<br>

<br>
 I really don't know all the history from 2 years ago and quite frankly I don't care.<br>
<br>
That being said I was witness to the kael raid thing.<br>
<br>
Gabby was group with guild in kael. Marklar was going to join us. Yes Gabby put up a fuss. Threatened to leave if he was allowed to join his guild's raid. Ending said raid knowingly. Yes that is her right.....It was a power play and she knew it. Marklar graciously bowed out. This did of course bring up all kinds of questions. Things that should have been left in the freaking past.Now Gabby did not spout BS to all. But left the shadow where intended.Starting trouble was the name of this game.<br>
<br>
 She then proceeded to try to come aboard me..... not a good idea. That got settled quickly <br>
<br>
This never should have been brought up...Is all in the past leave it there. <p><image src="http://www.btinternet.com/~killspring/skylah04.jpg"></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uskylahspirithunter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skylah Spirithunter</A> at: 8/21/02 11:23:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uopalmoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Opalmoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/21/02 11:25:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=479.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some F*cked up Sh*t !</span><hr size=1> I wish I had the logs from TT that night you lying sack of shit .. you sent me a tell saying my res was not good enuf you would find another but could i stick around just in case you couldnt gahhh ...your pathetic !!!!!<br>

<br>
Bringin shinu on our raid ..was my idea ....andyou agreed to it ..shinu sent you and email ..AND posted on our webboard .<br>
<br>
She laid out Very clear rules for the raid and we all agreed to em.  And you agreed to em on webboard.<br>
<br>
Then you start questioning the rules publicly ..and puttin up a fuss ..you send shinu an email.<br>
<br>
She sends you one back stating she wasnt going to lead the raid any longer.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is at the time ..shinu was doin this to help us .she had no reason to go ..had all her gear ....<br>
<br>
She made it clear from the get-go that if she was gonna lead it ..things were goin to be her way or the highway ..we agreed and then you welched on the deal.<br>
<br>
Dont you blame me for what happened ..it was YOUR doin ..<br>
<br>
As far as TT ..aye i mentioned that id rather have a 56 rez ..but i was more than willing to take a 49 and i made that clear...and i wasnt the only one in that group ..you went and rezzed yourself that nite then logged for the nite leavin us to fend for ourselves and find our own rez ...remember this was back in the days when you could count the number or rezzin level clerics on one hand.<br>
<br>
And you forget ..me and my friends from healers united ..broke off from our group ..to help you get YOUR seb key ..we had ours already ....and ya left us all there to fend for ourselves ..it took maiti workin half the nite to get us out of that jam.   What makes it worse was you were the leader of our guild ..supposed to represent us, and you not only bailed on me ..you bailed on a member of another guild who bent over backwards to help you ..<br>
<br>
And she will corroborate this story ..as you certainly made an impression to her that nite<br>
<br>
What really pisses me off about this whole damn thing ..is that it happened TWO freakin years ago.  Its obvious we dont like each other.  But ive kept my mouth shut and havent posted on boards ..even when youve slammed me publicly over and over again until now.   You and your sister have acted with malice towards me with stunts like tryin to keep me off of my OWN guild raids ..and leaving and making a stink when i go to help out my friends in MK.  Its very underhanded ..and dirty ..and ive put up with it ALL quietly.<br>
Until now.  Not only are you blastin me ..but your blastin my friends and a guild you were leader of ....do you really turn coat that easily?<br>
<br>
This shit is two years old ..and shoulda been forgotten 2 weeks after it happend ..but you two wont let it die ..you keep dragging it out OVER AND OVER ..WTF ..cant you let this be ..its TWO FRICKEN YEARS OLD ..why the hell are you still talking about it ..get the hell over it already.   Its these public posts that landed ya on the board deny list in the first place.<br>
<br>
If you truly care half as much about MK as you say ..youll end this stupid nonsense for good and get on with your life<br>
<br>
As you stated im /ignored for EQ life ..then for gods sake ignore me ..ive done the same to you for 2 years.  Stop bringing this OUTDATED dirty laundry out for everyone to see.<br>
