We got Raehn saying that Cazel was up and UP Enc engaged.  OK so /who all unruled.  Two with roleplay on, one in Sro, and teh rest in teh far reaches of the world that are non port zones such as Chardok and Maidens.  We decide to mobilize and if UP comes they come.  I do a /who all unruled approx 20 min later and I notice that every UP person is in the same zone as they were 20 minutes ago even the one in Sro.  Right or wrong I can at least honestly say they didnt move real fast.  <br>
<br>
As far as an Enc and lower level Paladin soloing Cazel it wont happen.  Necros far better then myself have tried it and havent been able to do it and a high level Necro is more powerful then a lower level paladin and a 60 Ench in this zone since necros dots and pet is more DPS then they were supplying.   I honestly feel they would not have been successful if they had continued.<br>
<br>
We probably should have allowed her to die before engaging but after doing a /who all unruled numerous times it was obvious IMO that they were not moving to assist.  I realize that some could have been /anon or on twinks.  Kiting till forces arrive is a method of holding a mob but how long do you allow a kite when you have sufficient force when it is obvious from my point of view that no more UP were on the way.<br>
<br>
I realize Radiant has a bad rep at times but from the people I have met in this guild not one person ever has done something to blatantly piss people off if it hasnt been done to us by them many times over.  As for Hate I know we moved slow to Safe Camp to avoid aggro and after seeing Quechan pull Hate 3 times now I am pretty comfortable saying she didnt bring a train of 20 mobs.  From my viewpoint we were in teh middle of fighting a few mobs when all of a sudden all hell broke lose.  With as many mobs as we had in camp I highly doubt Quechan was out pulling plus all members had been in safe camp long enough to not have generated aggro from running there.  I am not sure if Quechan stood up to help in teh fight and somehow some aggro was still attached which might have happened.  The only other thing I can see was UP brought some chain aggro onto us and dumped it there.  I was AFk for the 2nd floor incident so wont comment on it since I prefer to not speak about things I wasnt privy too. <br>
<br>
The Cazel incident was unfortunate and I apoligize for the hard feelings.  Unfortunatly the high end game is a huge damn race and he who is fastest normally wins.  I dont think it is right nor do I like it but it is teh way things work.  I dont know what to say about Cazel as I would probably be mad about someone taking a mob from me but if I cant kill it then why even attempt to try?  Epics suck and force people to race for spawns and the person who normally loses is pissed.  I dont harbor bad feelings against UP as I havent had any dealings with them that I can honestly say without a doubt that they wronged me as speculation is an ugly thing.  What we did at Cazel was based around the fact that UP wasnt mobilizing and yes Trist was checking to see if they were moving as far as I know.  All that I have stated are from my point of view and may or may not be true.<br>

Raehn is one of the sweetest persons to play eq and she does not want to cause discord or mistrust at this level.  Though I can't speak for her, expect her to mq the spoon back to Amaya.  I think the Cazel incident came about as what happened in hate, though I don't necessarily agree with the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; attitude, it is over, Raehn will rectify the situation.  Please do not flame Radiant for misdoings that are pure speculation.  All in all, Radiant is a good guild with good people.  It is unfortunate that we have been caught up in a flame like this where much is formulated on baseless accusations saying we are as bad ADD was etc.  Do to the deleterious side affects of flame posts against guilds, many guild reputations have suffered from it, even though that guild may have been a good guild, the flames against it were able twist lies and truths into a bunch of half truths.  Everyone is entitled to opinions but get the facts please before making that opinion.  Up to this point it has been all conjectures without any supporting evidence.<br>

<br>
When my ranger was 20 something and fighting in South Karana many moons ago, there was a bard that would run around and aggro every single gnoll around the paw spires and say he was 'kiting' them, in other words he was engaged with them and killing them.  He was, but so slowly that he made no tangible dent in even one gnoll's health after about 10 minutes of kiting.<br>
<br>
Guess what.  A guide or GM (Can't remember which because I didn't notice such things back then) showed up and /killed every single one of the gnolls he was 'kiting' because he could not possibly kill them and he was disrupting the zone.<br>
<br>
Additionally I have seen guides time and time again specifically state that sufficient force constitutes the right to a monster, not 'snare it and run it around for a while'.  See ragefire disputes in the past when a single druid would snare the human version and run him around while a guild mobilized.  That does not constitute engagement and never has, this is no different.  Sufficient force is not a matter of numbers, it is a matter of ability.  <br>

<br>
We ported up and maintained an active presence in the port up location for about 15 minutes, killing the five or six mobs that immediately aggroed us, and then having Quechan pull the path to the safe camp for more spawns/roamers/etc.<br>
<br>
Only when Quechan could neither find nor aggro any more mobs, did we move to the safe camp.  In my mind this pretty much rules out any sort of aggro or pathing that would cause Radiant to train the safe camp.<br>

Amaya should be so lucky as to have such wonderful supportive people in her guild, that will drop everything to come to the assistance of its members, no matter how trivial.  <br>
<br>
I believe my epic should be a great accomplishment for me to take pride in achieving.  I am proud of the actions of my guild.  They quickly came to help with a mob that I had been camping for a good part of the evening, and in fairness, allowed Amaya sufficient time to secure force in zone to kill him.  She was not able to do so, nor would she have been able to take it down with a paladin and her pet even if given all fookin day to do so (any that claim otherwise are full of pooka).  <br>
<br>
I knew that I couldn't take him down with myself and a monk, so rather than engage it and kite it about ridiculously, I waited until they arrived.  Even after they did, she was given more time for her crew to arrive.  They never showed up.  <br>
<br>
Call me arrogant if you choose, Esmalyn.  You don't know me.  To say an ENC, her pet, and a 40's paladin are taking out Cazel as a duo team is asinine, and I'm sure you know it.  No matter how much time you give them, it's not going to happen.  Could we have helped her?  Sure, but frankly, I don't camp a mob for hours hoping to advance my epic just to hand it over to another character, who is a complete stranger to me, and who engaged it without hope of killing it with the sole intent of preventing me from doing so.  Anyone who says they do is also full of pooka.   <br>
<br>
Also, to point out that if UP was so in the right, a GM or guide would have supported her petition and awarded her the epic piece (or destroyed it) just goes to show that the events of yesterday were not against the rules of Verant.  We could have waited for her to die and/or zone, which we did not.  Done over, I would probably have let events play out to that end result.  <br>
<br>
Ulwern, your initial flame was childish.  You didn't even bother to come to help your chanter, but you are willing to come here and point fingers and scream foul play because of your personal grudge.  I stayed in Oasis for more than an hour after Cazel died, as did Amaya (petitioning, I believe).  NO ONE from your guild showed up with the exception of one supportive soul.  NO ONE was anywhere near Oasis and NO ONE ever was (save one person).  If you say otherwise, you are LYING.  <br>
<br>
As I have the spoon, I could continue merrily on my way with my epic; however, I really don't feel that bad blood like this is ever a good thing.  Also, don't want ghosts of nasty flames following my snakie stick everywhere I go.  There will always be other Cazel's.  There is time enough for me to get my epic.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, to end this ugly mess, and as a token gesture of goodwill, I have spoken with Amaya and offered to give her the spoon and/or camp it with her until she gets it.  She has accepted.<br>
<br>
Thanks to my guild for supporting me in this decision as well.  I love you guys!! <p><img src="http://www.legendarydefenders.com/pics/raehnsig.jpg

I wasn't even there for the Cazel incident, so obviously it wasn't THAT important to me. If you'd actually read the post, well, actually read and UNDERSTAND the post, then you'd know that I stated many times my reason for coming onto the board was to defend myself initially from Ulwern calling me a dumb newb and being up on the wall. I specifically stated that I wasn't at the Cazel incident, and that really I had no standing in it, but damn, if you didn't come off on that, too. Stop just skimming through the posts looking for peoples names and reading those sentences. <br>
<br>
I DID claim, however, that IF I was in Oasis, and Cazel WAS up, which I DID state that I RARELY go through Oasis, but most of the time I DO RARELY go through Oasis, I hear or see Cazel up, I would call a UP member in, if that would make them happy. I even try to rectify the situation, without me even being in the current one, and you start throwing the flames. How utterly moronic and stupid can you be? Off with you sychophant, you've been sucking on the backs of everyone else too long.<br>
<br>
I wasn't there for Cazel. I was there for Hate. How many times do I have to make this perfectly clear? Here, for the dumb as shit trolls that I knew would surface during the day, since they obviously don't like the sunlight and have decided to strike to the boards in the dark and safety of their rooms...<br>
<br>
I WASN'T THERE FOR CAZEL<br>
I WASN'T THERE FOR CAZEL<br>

To make it even easier for the skimmers that only look for peoples names...<br>
<br>
ULWERN, I WASN'T THERE FOR CAZEL<br>
UNRULED POWER, I WASN'T THERE FOR CAZEL<br>
<br>
And yes, it is just a damned spoon, to me. You want my assistance, I offered it, without posing undue stress on myself, since I wasn't even associated with the CAZEL incident and UNRULED POWER. I sure as shit don't need the spoon, but like I said, you want it, I see it, I call you. It's that simple. Please, by all means, flame me some more for telling you I'd help.<br>

Cyphon, I'd be willing to bet you would do a lot better typing if you took a chance and pulled both your thumbs out of your ass. <br>

Fine, I can agree to disagree.<br>
<br>
There is one thing that I will admit we were wrong in, and that is the &quot;eye for an eye&quot; attitude. Even through all the shit Unruled has pulled on us I have never ever condoned training THEM or any other guild or persons. In this one instance I snapped and I take full responsibility for it. I made the call to engage, no one else did.<br>
<br>
I do NOT think we were wrong by the ~technical~ terms of engagement. If we were really dicks, we could be doing that all the time, but we aren't, so we don't. After the events of Hate I can understand our slipping down to UP's moral ground and that I do regret.<br>
<br>
That being said, Raehn will be giving the spoon to Amaya. She (Raehn) has a technical right to keep it, but not a moral one. Guess which is more important to us.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your epic Amaya.<br>
To the rest of UP, especially Ulwern - I suggest you stay very far away from us from now on. Or we may as well turn on /guildwar permanently. <p><a href="http://www.theradiant.net"><img border="0" src="http://www.theradiant.net/TristSig7.jpg" width="310" height="335"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uquechansama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QuechanSama</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/22/02 4:20:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=534.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rules of Engagement</span><hr size=1> Oops, Dupe post <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uquechansama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QuechanSama</A> at: 9/22/02 4:21:09 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucyphonsunofmarr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyphon SunofMarr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/22/02 4:26:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=534.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rules of Engagement</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

I think had you all let things play out the enchanter in UP would have eventually gotten a fear resist (or some other small bit of unluck) and would have either died or had to zone and you would have  gotten the spoon without all the mess.<br>
But the past can not be redone and you have done what needs to be done to set things right.  I think for anyone in UP to continue to flame Radiant after Raehn's selflessness of giving up an epic piece for the good of her guild would be in very poor taste.<br>

We both don't want any more blood spilled about this. So let's just go our own way and leave it be. And to be truthful, I would have died if the pally had not LoH'd me right before Radiant took aggro. Any flames made my by guild after this, I will reprimand them myself. As for the future, yes I believe Radiant and Unruled Power should stay away from each other. It's just going to cause problems. Maybe one day, we'll get into more friendly terms.

I know it is not your fault this happened, but rather you were caught in the middle of a power struggle. I am fortunate to have got my first spoon shortly after epics were introduced and no one knew who Cazel was.<br>

BTW, I can kill Cazel with just me and a druid, or a paladin. I've done it before, and can do it again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
