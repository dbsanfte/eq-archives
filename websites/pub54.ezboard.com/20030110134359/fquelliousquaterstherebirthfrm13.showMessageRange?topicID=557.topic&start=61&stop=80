Galiana what is Kalsto's name on SZ? was gonna ;tell him last night but you weren't online. for those that were in descent, remember those times we'd break into fear straight to SWC with out dieing?

Kinda funny listening to the boasts and all.<br>
<br>
I remember some times.  A time when the last QQ would try to control raid reservations.  It got so bad that when I was leading a PoH raid, I had some wanker send mea tell... &quot;It's 12:01am, you need to leave Hate, my guild has it now...&quot;  haha I was like uhm no.<br>
<br>
An era where VM was known as the worst guild on the server due to it's reputed stepping on ppl.  After a reign of the worst reputation around they were overshadowed by Descent instaneously becoming hated by LC when the contested Ragefire when Ebane was there.  Descent purposely agro'd him and got slaughtered in some lameass attempt to claim the spawn by failure rofl.  In my limited view and knowledge of Descent I would have to say this doomed them.  LC would have done anything to ruin them after that.  They messed with the wrong cleric.  Shortly after, as in days?  Descent was gone.<br>
<br>
These descent people then mostly got absorbed into Wraith.  Wraith then had an infamous day in WW.  Probably only 1 or 2 people actually know what happened that day.  But the jist is that VM and Wraith were fairly against each other already.  LC went for Myga, Wraith went for Myga, trains ensued, hatred ensued, lies about what happened ensued.  And VM and LC came out on the opposite side of Wraith.  Wraith had pissed off the other 2 large guilds and was then fookered.  LC and VM would tag team them to dust after that rediculous mess.  Some valiant Wraith members left the zone and others detagged due to that crap that was led by, if my memory serves me, Droz and a few ex-Descent members.<br>
<br>
On the LC side of things. :^)  One day, two of its officers purposely ordered the troops into Kael because they knew VM was after AoW and they were out for revenge about a NToV jumping.  This disgusted many of the members, some left for such pissing contests.<br>
<br>
None of those guilds are perfect, many of their successes were at the cost of petty childish backstabbings of each other.  Honestly it makes me glad that I was in a smaller guild for much of the BS that happened on Quell.<br>
<br>
If ya'll haven't noticed, Quellious is just about the weakest lamest server in the game.  And we can all thank each other for this bickering, backstabbing, ranting and whining.  Since we could never work together, we could never achieve crap.<br>
<br>
We have a whole 1 guild in VT MONTHS after other servers.  We have yet to clear deep AC.  We have yet to kill Seru?  That god we killed the king of Akanon or I would have lost all hope.  Seriously, grow the fuck up and stop dishing out this I'm better than you bullshit.  If you can get over yourself for maybe even a few minutes, maybe we can turn our server around and get some game-wide achievements or recognition.<br>

<br>
Is it just me or is that one hypocritic post? Just to clear up some of this cloudy vision you have Transkor. You dont know Wraith, you didnt know LC or VM back then,you dont know what went on back then, so how bout STFU? No one disbanded, no one left the zone after the Myga situation, and Wraith wasnt run by any ex-Descent. The only thing you manage to peg right was I was leader of Wraith. So do us all a favor and and try and comment on something you might of been a part of or might have some knowledge about. VM and LC already had an undertsanding or somesuch, Wraith was never fookeredas you put it, we went our own way as usual, and as we do now. Clowns like you twisting facts about something you havent a single clue about is what keeps people at each other's throats. So read your last paragraph in your response and take your own advice. <br>
<br>
LisaW71:<br>
<br>
Now that I know who you are, your post dont surprise me. Guess I dont have to point out the obvious to you, you basically said Wraith has done nothing cuz we team with another guild. Then say it must be nice to have another guild to team with. Make up your mind, is it good or is it bad? Personally Revivisence is the best kind of guild you could ever want to team with. Very good players, very nice people, and pull their own weight, and the two guild click together. So again, if you wanna discredit what Wraith/Rev has done cuz we are two guilds, thats your perrogative. Just like its mine to say I really dont care what you think of what we've done and how we did it. Point is said mob is dead, and we (Wraith/Rev) did it. Funny how you even say that in your response &quot;As Chikkin said, to me it doesnt matter how many you use, be it 5 or 95, as long as you have fun ja?&quot;, guess you play both sides of the fence? Also do me a favor please, only my friends call me &quot;Zeus&quot;.<br>

Whoa! hold on there.. (removed offending comment)Saelamdar was there first. That was after Kalsto left the guild so we were a little out of whack and got into a bit of trouble.<br>
So technically the guild died before that even happened.  Then of course Saelamdar moved to SZ right? so he only had his epic for like a week sigh.<br>
<br>
In fact weren't you the guy who chain cast Sentinel to lag us to death?<br>
<br>
or is this all water under the brige muahaha. <p><center>

She was helping buff a Naggy raid lead by Mithril Legends with the intent camping for Rage afterwards.  After Naggy was dead Saelamder annouced he was camping the spawn and that Mithril Legends had agreed to that and proceeded to harass Ebane.  Ebane being the lady that she is, left the zone disappointed.  She does not like confrontation and would rather spend her time helping her friends.  After hearing about what happened, Mithril Legends said that it never promised Saelamder the Rage spawn and they thought Ebane was camping it.  With encouragement from her friends in Lotus Cult, Ebane went back to camp him, figuring that they would either roll for the spawn or that the person with the force to take down Rage first would get him.  The rest of what happened is history.<br>
<br>
I won't let you call Ebane a liar and not contest it.  She is a sweet and generous person who does not deserve that.   Nor am I calling Saelamder a liar either, he may have gone on the Naggy raid with the intent of camping Rage afterwards and told someone in Mithril Legends that and that person didn't bother to tell anyone else.  Neither you nor I know the whole story or what was said by everyone.  In hindsight, I think everyone involved would have wished that matters turn out differently and that it could have been amicably resolved.  But don't say Ebane lied to get the spawn. <p><img border="0" src="http://www.pinbinvalendral.atfreeweb.com/saroeb/sylvi99.jpg"><br><a href ="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18069">My Gear</a>

I just don't remember the AoW incident all that well, it must not have been a big deal to me.  All I remember is us owning NToV all the way through for the first time and the Sleeper being released within a few days by VM.

Umm, no. I was there. Were you there? Oh yea, you probably were, with the group that decided to spawn Rage with about 9 people knowing you would wipe, but also knowing that the dragon would wipe us too. Of course your whole reasoning was that since you spawned it, you could then gather your forces to kill the dragon while it sat in his lair. Even though we had the force there to kill it before you, and didn't resort to gimp tactics to try to claim the spawn. <br>
<br>
Call someone a liar if you want, that's fine. Just make fucking sure you call the right person the liar. It wasn't Ebane, but whoever that gimp Descent cleric was, who amazingly enough isn't around anymore is he? <p><center><img src=http://i.xanga.com/lfanninc/tattlelc.jpg img> <br>
