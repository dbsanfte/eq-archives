My point is this.  If you were not prepared to step to the plate and fix what was wrong instead of running off to play with yourself somewhere else what possible good can come of bashing a pickup raid.<br>
<br>
I'm guessing the raid leader had little experience (or just plain dropped the ball).  Either way, he's got to start somewhere and leaders make mistakes.  Where do you get off whining that you didn't get a group?  Be a true sport and laugh in the face of danger run in there and cast your debuff spells or what have you....gasp ...  SOLO!  So what if you die you have a freaking 60 cleric in the next room and you did your part as best you could.<br>
<br>
Instead you run away and cry on the boards about a grave injustice and how poorly a pickup raid was run, leaving 30plus other people in the lurch. HAHA  The fact that you made it to the buff hall is more than many pickup raid do!<br>
<br>
And to whoever led this raid, success or not... I applaud you.  Regardless of your motives leading raids ... pickup raids doubly so... is 95% headache 5% reward.  Don't let the failures stop you from trying again and becoming a leader.<br>

I believe Driemy clearly stated more than once that she addressed the raid channel (again, more than once) about not having a group.  That at least deserved a response (something akin to &quot;Ok, I'll get those I missed a group in a sec, in tell hell atm&quot;.  How hard is that?<br>

<br>
A Naggy/Vox raid is not really the place to start gettin' raid experience.  This is why I will go on very few Naggy/Vox raids, with only a few trusted leaders.  The &quot;pickup&quot; type ones tend to go very badly, and tend to be poorly organized for this reason.  Driemy was completely within her rights to leave once she was ignored for a significant period of time.  <br>
<br>
You sound to me like one of those people that as soon as a raid wipes starts runnin' around, blamin' everyone under the sun for the wipe, instead of tryin' the find the best way to CR, and finish the matter at hand if that's what's decided.<br>
<br>
I don't have a flame meter, and I'm not tryin' to start one... just my honest opinion.<br>

Epicure -<br>
<br>
Your laying into Driemy is pretty off-base, mate... she did the right thing... if the raid leader ain't leading his raid... get the hell outta dodge while ya can... why?<br>
<br>
the raid leader has 101 things to do... agreed... <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   however</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->... one of the top 10 things on that list is...... MAKING SURE EVERYONE HAS A GROUP... or that he has appointed someone to handle groups for him/her. It's the leader's job.. not the people who are following that leader.. to assign and form groups..<br>
<br>
Hell... let's do a David Letterman style top 10 list of a raid leader's duties:<br>
<br>
#10 Making sure that ogre asses have been washed to avoid staining other raiders in cramped tunnels!<br>
<br>
#9  Check that wood elf ladies are showing at least 8 inches of cleavage to help raid morale<br>
<br>
#8 Announce the finalists for the wet t-shirt contest<br>
<br>
#7 Make sure the shadowknights still suck.<br>
<br>
#6 Tell the bards that tonight's raid is Barry Manilow only...<br>
<br>
#5 Make sure that the pull team has enough beer and hard liquor to achieve a proper main-assist-passed-out raid-wipe and  CR<br>
<br>
#4 Make sure the chat channel password is so complicated that even you can't remember it.<br>
<br>
#3 Walk around saying &quot;it's good to be the king&quot;<br>
<br>
#2 Make sure your are surrounded with empty pop bottles to take a leak in without leaving your keyboard...<br>
<br>
and the number one thing a raid leader needs to do:<br>
<br>
GNOMES! GNOMES! GNOMES! GNOMES! GNOMES!<br>

<br>
I don't approve of her leaving, she committed to the raid and bailed because things were not smooth enough for her.  Then has the gall to come here and cry about it.  Leaving might be a logical and acceptable course of action on a ToV raid or ST raid or even a little ol fear raid, but a naggy raid? when you have a cleric parked in the hall outside?  Please!  What did she stand to lose? 20 mins of her time and worse case a pixel of blue xp.<br>
<br>
Her leaving at a critical time during the raid just because she did not have a group was why pickup raids have a low success rate.<br>
<br>
She stated earlier that I had high expectations of what people must do on raids.  Not true.  I have one expectation,  Do your best.  Thats it.<br>
<br>
To those who think she should have been given a group.  Of course!! But until you yourself try leading a similar raid with 30plus people you honestly dont have the right to state your opinion.  <br>
<br>
Fact of the matter is, leading this type of raid is tough.  Did she help the raid? YES, hell she brought a 60 cleric which is more than I've ever seen on a naggy raid.  Did she do all she could to help after commiting to the raid ... sadly NO.  She left the raid high and dry.  Fine.  But don't come here complaining and looking for sympathy unless you give 100%.<br>
<br>
As for me being the type of guy who looks to place blame... too funny.  Lets remember who started this thread.<br>

<br>
As for leaving the raid because not getting a group...@#%$....i deguilded from LC for a couple days because i sat on a raid LFG for over an hour...  My general thought is, if someone has LFG tag up, and you have a spot, invite that person.  Being ungrouped on a raid blows.<br>
<br>
a raid leader should know when to 'give up' and move on if a raid doesn't look to be successful.  It's easy to lead a raid and fail. Knowing when NOT to raid is an even harder task.  Being a raid leader is a rough proposition(well, when you do more than take orders from Biffins).  I've done groups once...and it shied me away from being anything close to a raid leader... <p><img src="http://www.geocities.com/gorfain_family/ishsig7.txt"

<br>
This sounds to me like a difference in opinion from those who's tried to set up 40-50 people raid groups and those who havent.<br>
<br>
Point is... its not easy and you'll miss some people.<br>
<br>
You'll also miss people say they are looking for a group as well as your not watching the computer, your writing names down on a piece of paper putting them into groups.<br>
<br>
A person just starting out leading a raid is going to have a lot to learn about this and it will take lots of patience.<br>
<br>
Yes, Vox and Naggy are where raid leaders start learning usually,  I cant think of too many 40-50 people raids before that.<br>
<br>
If the raid leader ignored you on purpose then ya, get upset/quit/etc.<br>
<br>
How likely is this? very slight...if he/she didnt want you there then you'd wouldnt have been invited.<br>
<br>
Obviously he didnt see you say looking for a group.  A common mistake that just happens.<br>
<br>
I lead these kind of raids 3-4+ times a week, very experienced at it and I miss people all the time.  Although lately the 'grouping' job is delegated to someone else ( try it ).<br>
<br>
My suggestion is to have some patience.<br>
<br>
Yes, say lfg in the raid channel a few times at first.<br>
<br>
If that doesnt get his attention ( easily missed as sometimes there are many channels to moniter ( raid, group, healer, leader, etc. ) then send him/her a few tells.<br>
<br>
If that doesnt work, ask someone else helping the raid who's in charge a bit... puller, etc.<br>
<br>
If that doesnt work, spam the hell out of the channel till he see's it.<br>
<br>
More then likely you see him/her say, &quot;crap, sorry I missed ya&quot;<br>
<br>
If that still doesnt work then ya, you need to leave because you are being ignored at this point on purpose.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Most of the times I've seen this happen is because people ignore the raid leader saying &quot;join /raidchannel everyone&quot; and since a lot of the times the groups are made out of the list of folks in that channel then you'll be missed.<br>
<br>
But that is a problem with the raider ignoring the commands of the raidleader and the raiders fault.  Most of the times, this is who to blame.<br>
<br>
<br>
But hell, groups usually arent made at first at vox/naggy raids anyways... just make up a group to clear the path to where you stage for the raid.<br>

As the only enchanter, you would think that she would have been important enough to think about. Considering that there was also a level 60 cleric camped for the raid to help with CR is a bonus as well. Yes, lots of stuff goes on raids, but if the leader couldn't manage to organize groups, the basic of raid duties, how well do you think that raid would have gone? I assure you, as most of us have also experienced, the CR could easily have taken 2 hrs. <br>
<br>
So what if she left. She had no loyalty to those guys, and if she felt she was being ignored, forgotten, etc, and taken advantage of, she was within her right to leave. She came here to vent, not to flame anyone in particular. I don't recall seeing any names named. So why are you flaming her for exercising a right to a) leave a raid she was feeling bad about being on and b) venting out a general frustration? If you think she is full of @#%$, ignore her. <p><table border=0>

I disagree a bit there Epicure...<br>
<br>
<br>
A pickup raid isn't the same as a raid with a regular team.<br>
<br>
When your team has a bad day, you suck it up... you know tommorow your crew will have their @#%$ together.  You know your team well.... if someone is uncharacteristically being a flake, you know it's not the general rule for them.  Your team will be there to talk to as a group in game, on the boards ect after the fact to work out differences.   Now, on a pickup raid especially if you don't know the raiders well, it's much easier to get frustrated with mistakes, especially simple ones.  It's also more likely those mistakes are more the norm, if the raid crew is inexperienced.  You also simply don't have the connection/comraderie or loyalty to a bunch of guys trying to kill vox than you do your home team.<br>
<br>
As a leader of a guild/team raid, you know your crew and can assume and delegate things more.  You can't on a pickup.  You can't tell a pickup raid &quot;use standard wall positioning&quot;.  Or &quot;get yer buffs up as needed&quot;.   Pickup raids are hard.. even with the new chat system you need to micromanage a lot more.  On a pickup raid you also can't look at things in a long term effect.  A chanter you ask to come as the only chanter there is doing you a favor, usually.  Unless there is some personal history there from times past, that chanter is a key class that raid needs, and the Leader has to make sure the key classes are taken care of.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I agree or disagree with what happened in this case.. I think the raid leader screwed up, and maybe the chanter left hasitly, but ... it was a pickup raid.  I don't know the individuals involved, and without knowing any history between them, I see no reason why the enchanter should feel obligated to stay and help if she was being ignored, intentionally or not.  It doesn't look like either side was out to screw the other, one side goofed and the other side was looking out for themselves first... both of which are part of the pickup raid game. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

So why come to QQ and start a flame thread for a raid you did not even have the guts to stick with.<br>
<br>
I mean really, a 60 cleric sitting in the hall, how much did this person have to lose?  Now how much did that person have to offer?<br>
<br>
Pickup raids are where you meet new players.  Where you see who can single handedly make or break a raid.  Who has their poop in a group and who does not.  Lets be honest, pickup raids are not for XP or guarenteed loot thats for dang sure.<br>
<br>
She went all the way to buff hall, presuming she waited till buffs were done before fleeing, there was perhaps 20 mins left in the raid for better or for worse.<br>
<br>
If she didn't have the patience and commitment to see it through so close to the finish then she sure as heck does not need my sympthy or agreement.<br>
<br>
Had she run in solo casted her buffs died for the cause and lost her pixel of blue xp and then complained about poor raid leadership I might lend an ear.  But really ... a level 60 with an alt in 50's, please! She knew what to expect.  Why bash a raid when at that level you should know darn well that it's not going to be top-notch.<br>

The only reason you are bashing her is because that is the only name posted in the initial thread. Why is it easier to excuse bad leadership and flame the person griping about it instead? I have been on a vox raid once and even well run its kinda chaotic, especially when you are the only one of your class there (buffers). <br>
<br>
Chaos aside, a bit of common courtesy would have been in order. I don't care what level you are, no one deserves to be misteated, taken advantage of, left out, etc. She already stated she was probably going to have to suck up the cost of the dots (common on pickup raids), all she expected was some common courtesy and for someone to recognize her existance.<br>
<br>
Flame me, flame her, flame Ishan, but admit that the whole thing sucked, and hopefully the raid leader learned from this experience (doubtful though) and deserves to take some heat as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucolach.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Colach</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/19/02 12:55:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=401.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: enchanters and naggy</span><hr size=1> omg venting on a flame board is such a novel idea too isn't it!

Of course I've learned from pickup raids...mainly to not go on them. <p><p align = center><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13808" target="new" width=800 height=600 scrollbars=0 resizable=0 menubar=0 toolbar=0 location=0 directories=0 status=0 copyhistory=0>Colach Dakai</a>

<br>
Firstly, I have led many FFA raids - from when QQ was about to now where I occasionally become involved in them and often lead.   (This is around 2 years of FFA raid leading experience).  <br>
<br>
Epicure, it is your responsibility to lead the raid ensure that people have a group.  You make sure all classes are covered, you make sure that each person has a group.  <br>
<br>
Simply, ask in chat prolly 4-5 times before you get a successful reply, and you juggle your groups accordingly. <br>
<br>
You will get tells about loot, you will get tells about groups, you will get tells about how ya gonna do it, you will get tells about whos pulling.  <br>
<br>
In all essence prior to the raid beginning, there should be f'king smoke coming off your keyboard because your dealing with issues left right and centre.  <br>
<br>
As a raid leader, especially in FFA roles.  It is your responsibility, dont shy away from it.  You win, its your glory - you lose it's your fault.  <br>
<br>
By Driemy leaving, Epicure - its your responsibility for her leaving.  <br>
<br>
Why ? well you weren't to know that it was 3am for her, but she did not have a group.  That's not her responsbility, its yours as raid leader.  <br>
<br>
I appreciate that you can do so much, but do what you can.<br>
<br>
Driemy is one of my guildies granted, but the same reply would be given to anyone.  Driemy is undoubtedly - alongside Boldair, Azaneal, Pishoque and Sorren amongst the best clerics I have met and also very reactive/responsive especially when it comes to raids.<br>
<br>
I know I have harped on about responsibility, but raid leaders passing the blame and pointing fingers is in all essence, bollox. <br>
<br>
Quote<br>
<br>
Her leaving at a critical time during the raid just because she did not have a group was why pickup raids have a low success rate.<br>
<br>
Bollox also m8.  I have around a 80% success rate on FFA raids<br>

Most, if not all raidleaders have done this a few times.<br>
<br>
Bollox! if you claim to be a raid leader and havent missed putting someone into a group and missing a tell or two asking in chat.<br>
<br>
I've also seen people say twice that they need a group then  cuss out the raid and log off during the time it takes the group maker to be afk taking a piss.<br>
<br>
In the end, people need to have patience and not start crying and take it as a personal insult if they dont immediately get a group.<br>
<br>
Like I said before, its not that a raid leader will intentionally not put you into a group just to hurt your feelings.<br>
<br>
In the end... Raidleaders do your best not to miss people and raider have a few minutes of patience.  Mistakes will be made and both need to suck it up.<br>
