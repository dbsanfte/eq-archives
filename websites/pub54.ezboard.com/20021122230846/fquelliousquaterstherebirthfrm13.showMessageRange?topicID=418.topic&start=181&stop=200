<br>
posting on a message board is better than playing 60 hours a week isnt it?<br>
<br>
<br>
Agree with me?   thats like 5 times in 2 months... am i beginning to make sense finally?<br>
<br>
<br>
Descent had some of the best people on the server at the time and they moved onto improve and start some of the best guilds on the server today..<br>
<br>
Same thing happened with the collapse of Legendary Heroes and the exodus from Dragonbane..<br>
<br>
If you look at the top guilds on the server you will see the majority of them came from LH/DB/Descent.  The guilds of today may not have existed if these 3 guilds hadn't fallen apart.  It hurt at the time but it caused more good in the future.. <br>
<br>
Those were the 3 guilds I knew of directly but other guilds falling apart (PoN for example) also set the stage for the current top guilds.<br>
<br>
Funny how history works isnt it? <p><center>

Of course he was smiling when he said it. I'm actually surprised to see positive comments about him myself, because all I heard were unkind comments while I was on Quellious. Tells with ex-Descent people usually went along the lines of &quot;Look, I know you're RL friends with him, but...&quot; I think you even did it once, Gae. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
One thing I found funny, Sephrok was convinced that Kal hated him for taking all the ex-Descent folks to form Rel in Por, but Kal harbored no ill feelings at all. Descent was over, he took only the people he wanted to form Antiquity before leaving the server. But Seph wasn't convinced, to my amusement. I finally told him to pop onto Quellious some night and tell Seph he wasn't pissed at him, but he didn't care either way. <br>
<br>
It was pretty amazing to watch Vindictive (his guild) zone into DN, run down the Zland literally without stopping, mowing down every rat in their way, stopping for about a minute to buff, wiping out Zland with no losses, then evacing to zone and taking out Kland with zero losses. And he'd do this at work, too. I once took over his wizard while he handled a customer. Those guys could haul ass. But when you are on an nearly empty server, I guess it's easy to own.<br>
<br>
BTW, thinking of Antiquity, does anyone remember a bard named Spiritjazz? I wonder WEHT her. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugalianaelessedil.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galiana Elessedil</A> at: 9/4/02 8:42:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uturkee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Turkee </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 58<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/5/02 12:50:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=188>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Server Jerk</span><hr size=1> What ezboard can Kalsto be reached at?<br>
<br>
I'm sure I could search through SZ guild/msg boards, but i'm lazy.  :P<br>
<br>
<br>
My one present to Kalsto was giving him a white robe, not that ugly trak's teeth one, but that awesome befallen one. I forget the name of it... <br>
<br>
he actually wore it for a while until he had the manna robe. <br>
<br>
Kalsto's guild, took me from a ignorant to the high-end game, small guildminded 50 Bard (Lenaleni told me to lie, and say I was 51, so he'd tag me) to a lvl 56 Bard who actually was learning a bit about raiding. I was always impressed with Kalsto's ability, alot of what I have to say, matches what Biffin's recently posted at Vis msg board. <br>
<br>
Like Gaelron tho, I sometimes found it hard to endure his lack of patience. It boiled down to him being extremely talented, yet having to wait, and do things over and over, because of some random new-to-raiding player. And well, although he was talented, and a very skilled/smart player, I will always hate Choppa, and unfortunately, he was at times, Kalsto's righthand man. <br>
<br>
At one point, Vis was leaps ahead of everybody else, and Wraith/Descent/Lotus were all pretty much the same. Then well it all changed :P<br>
<br>
Btw, Does Shim and Kal #2 play in that guild?<br>
<br>
As for Spiritjazz, yah, who could forget the mithril bp, and crazy colors that female wood-elf had on. Spiritjazz spoke to my bard on a number of occaisons from her many twinks. <br>
<br>
<br>
-Chris/Chikkin<br>
<br>
the forever eq-past addict. <br>
<br>
<br>
oh and btw, you're dead on about Gae.. but he's slowly evolving I swear~~<br>
<br>
<br>
Hav, remember how badly you and I wanted Wraith and Descent to work together to catch up and pass Vis Maior, back before I left Descent? Remember the tried (and failed) Descent/Wraith combination Trak Raid, where I believe only you stayed? You won a Cop or Donals that day, dont remember which. <br>
<br>
Havent forgotten those days bud.

<br>
anyway<br>
<br>
Kalsto was obcessed with Vis.. Basically why he quit cause he wanted to be the best there ever was and that stubborness almost did it but in the end it consumed him. When Vis moved ahead he couldn't handle that...<br>
<br>
I liked Choppa but I know many others didn't.. He was kinda clueless and not really a true 2nd in command..  More like a sidekick..<br>
<br>
Syphonics was the real number 2 but Kalsto wanted all the power and pushed him out..<br>
<br>
It was the departure of Syphonics Karshan and Jeddia that also strained tensions heavily cause Syphonics was well respected and Karshan was our only good shaman.<br>
<br>
Also I was a paladin... Kalsto didn't care for paladins at all really I believe.  To him I was bait.. Didn't really care for that.  <br>
<br>
In a way I should thank him.. gave up on paladins went to wizards are I am much happier.. The day Descent died I was gonna ask if I could switch to a wizard to. <p><center>

I won the COP on default that day, already had Donals. I was the only one that stuck it out that day--a combination of the value I put on my word, proving a point, and being a stubborn son of a bitch.<br>
<br>
It was the quickest that karma has ever come full circle on me-making the sacrifice and then being rewarded so quickly. I still wear that COP today =D<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
Kalsto/Ostak's guild site is <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqvindictive.com/">www.eqvindictive.com/</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> but only members have access to the ezboard. Probably because the majority of SZ related ezboards are shut down for violating code of contact.<br>

and Gaelron, Pallies were bait, atleast for what Descent did at the time, like Ninadar going and taking the first hit of Trak, that was his prime role. <br>

didnt matter on their qualities..  Jeddia Karshan and Syphonics were well liked people and he tossed them aside and wouldn't comment on it... That made people angry.<br>

When Ninadar wasn't on.... I was bait =)   I did our first pull of vindi though and NO i didnt die..  Never died on a bait pull..<br>
<br>
The thurgadin pants?  upgraded to ToV during paladin retirement..  Yea the thurg pants were really ugly but the ugliest i was ever was when I wore a Froglok BP from sebilis and had a dark green color.. I looked like a freaken bard (no offense =p) <p><center>

Gotta remember, I had given up on the game when I went into the computer store where he worked and saw him playing. That's how I met Kalsto and got back into the game. Talk about dumb luck, huh? Shoulda gone to CompUSA. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Funny thing, was, he encouraged me to come play on Q and said he'd help me, but he didn't leave Sebilis at all for months. I was like, 'what the hell are you doing in there every night for hours on end?' Never did get a straight answer. I think I was 30 when he came out, inspected me, and said 'what is this crap?' and proceeded to twink the hell outta me. My wisdom went from 120 to 200 in an hour. In hindsight, I can see why he waited. Wanted to make sure I was serious. And I'll give him credit, he stayed on Q just to help me finish my epic because he'd promised to do so, since my guild at the time was nothing but a social club.<br>
<br>
On a side note, one of the things I remember most fondly about my time on Quellious was all the total strangers who came to help with Faydedar. We had gotten owned the previous attempt because we were undermanned, and you know Kalsto, he hates losing more than Vis Maior and druids combined. So for the second effort, I had these ubers showing up out of the blue. Rabbid, Amanraz, Haans, Zenfe, Ghengis, and a 59 barb female shaman whose name I forgot. I still have the pictures of the fight on my old site, Dachunker was still using an epic back then. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We didn't lose a single person on that fight. These people didn't know me from Adam but came anyway. /salute to all of you for that. <br>
<br>
I do know that when he created Antiquity (I joined at 45 and had NO business being in that guild), he said flat out he wanted a small but tight guild like DoV and SoTU. As much as he had nothing nice to say about Vis, he never said anything but very good things about those two guilds, and when he quit Q, he encouraged me to join one of those guilds, but they are really tough to get into because they want to stay small, and I returned to familiar territory.  <br>
<br>
If you think he's anti-pally, try putting up with his anti-druid comments. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I didn't talk to him for months after getting fed up. But in the end, I learned more from him than anyone else in the game and he was monumentally patient with me, so I owe him that much.<br>

I think Kalsto was a great leader, but did indeed lack some finer points of &quot;people skills&quot;<br>

I wish things went better for Descent and Kalsto. <p><Center>
