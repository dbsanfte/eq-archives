<br>
I was not on that raid that you are referring to.  I am sure logs can be presented as evidence.  But if I ever am on a riad where we are or have leapfrogged you, plz send me a tell and, as I said, I will give our officers hell because I don't play like that.  <br>
<br>
And maybe I should say, leapfrogging a place-holding grp is not the same as leapfrogging a raid.  A raid is full-force, ready to kill assembly.  A place-holding grp is something a lame guild does to try to make up for the simple fact they don't got the numbers or mobility to strike fast.<br>
<br>
And, woowhatever, are you saying you are messing with us because of that raid oh so long ago?  When was that?  June?  July?  Do you actually enjoy playing EQ as if it were some sort of pro-wrestling grudge-match?  If so, you really need to take those WWF posters down off your wall (ask for mom's help tho, thumbtacks can be sharp, and you should always ask for mom or dad's permission before changing anything in your room!!)<br>
<br>
And gimilly, pudding for brains, I made that comparison because I *have* perspective.  Here is your vocabulary lesson: something can be compared to something, without being equivalent to it.  Sociopathic behavior is a huge category, and I mentioned terrorism to indicate how serious I think such behavior is.  Whenever a person or group treats another person or group without respect for their rights and happiness, that is sociopathic.<br>
<br>
I've already promised: I will never be part of a raid that leapfrogs or tries to otherwise thwart a superior or equal force that is clearly in gear for an encounter.  I will also promise, I will not allow 4 month old grudges determine how I play the game now.  Be nice if you explicit people could utter the same pledge.<br>
<br>
The sad fact is, explicit seems to be saying that in order to show people they &quot;mean business&quot; or are a &quot;serious guild,&quot; they need to employ just these same tactics.  They need to leapfrog to be taken seriously.  They need to try to place-hold mobs they do not have forces for in order to &quot;play tough.&quot;  They need to play for the sake of grudges in order to &quot;show people we mean to be a force.&quot;<br>
<br>
They have fundamentally misunderstood the basic good sportsmanship that holds on quellious.<br>
<br>
I would hate to play a round of golf with explicit.  They would say I was taking to long to tee off, and jump in front of me and quickly whack a shot that goes into the rough, then they would run ahead to try to whack their ball out of the rough before I can walk down the fairway, then they would send their caddies to race me to the green so they can block my put.  Then they would claim they &quot;won&quot; because they got in the hole first.<br>
<br>
It's time to stop playing grudge-matches explicit.  You are the only ones doing it at the high end these days, and just like many of you did way way back, you are stinking up the server.<br>

<br>
From what I have read this is in essence exactly what W/R is doing.  They are just saying that Explicit doesn't have enough people so therefore it's okay for them to play through.  <br>
<br>
The fact that you think anything that ever happens in the game of Everquest is anywhere even remotely serious as a terrorist act PROVES you haven't got one fucking iota of perspective.  <br>
<br>
Actually here is your vocabulary lesson for the day.  A Sociopath is simply someone who is either unable or unwilling to behave in a way that is acceptable to society.  Now in essence you could say that what BOTH guilds have been doing is sociopathic, but that still gives no credence to your comparison of this behavior to that of terrorists that kill thousands of people or someone that eats his victims.  Your mind is pretty fucking warped if you actually think your analogy is anywhere near in perspective.<br>
<br>
Here is one more vocabulary lesson for you.<br>
<br>
Perspective:  the capacity to view things in their true relations or relative importance <br>
<br>
This is what you lack.<br>

Or we should have just moved out of your way since you have more ppl than us? Any more thing to say to bash us?<br>
<br>
&quot;They need to leapfrog to be taken seriously. &quot;<br>
Sadly, yes...that's how it end up due to your F-ed up leadership.  If we didn't leapfrog you guys, will we draw so much attentions?  VM/LC take use seriously, maybe some words exchange..but at least we respect each other in public. Wraith? nah..just ignore and insult us.<br>
<br>
Warlordette, so....i gave you some numbers... We killed AOW with 40s yesterday, that's what kind of *force* we have--small but get things done.  now..honestly, you still think we didnt have enough?  and one last time...WE DIDNT KILL TM with a group to camp cursed.  VM killed TM for bags and we were waiting for repop when wraith poke in. You guys should know better coz you were doing creator at that time.  Why dont you just admit you guys made a mistake?<br>

Ok...back to first grade.  Two wrongs dont make a right.  Thank you.  Just because someone did something to you doesnt mean you have a right to do it back.  If you do, youre just as bad as they are.<br>
<br>
As to having 8 extra keys, yes it DOES make a difference in VT.  40 keys isnt quite enough to raid.  You wont have quite the class balance you need to kill some of the bosses, and then taking into account that not all keys may be online at the time.  8 extra keys makes just enough to field a decent raid force in VT  So yes, 8 keys does make a differece.

<br>
We killed the real (not nerfed) AoW with 45.  If you ever brought near 40 to a mob and we ran you over, you haven't mentioned it yet.<br>
<br>
When we went to basement, you were claiming with 18+ a few recruits.  Not 20 recruits or 30... not even 10 unless they were hiding or you tried counting the group that was killing under the ramp.<br>
<br>
You didn't just leave HP either, GM was involved. <br>
<br>
I remember clearly Salta insulting us and making comments when LC tried to run us out of basement with 35-40 people.   That's tagged ppl in-zone before they were... not 18 people with 30 &quot;going to log in soon&quot; or &quot;will be here later&quot; as we were being told in the basement.  So don't play that it's a wraith game.  Oh and same in Ntov... but of course it's only a bad thing and worthy of flames when we do it.   Of COURSE nobody EVER did that in old Vis.. that would be... completely hypocrical of Woow!  Woow is not a hypocrite, Vis never ever did anything of the sort, right?<br>
<br>
<br>
It's the same old story when old wraith caught up to vis, when LC caught up to vis, when we caught up to LC... it's the same scenarios over and over.. the new guy comes in with some folks and the old guard doesn't deem them &quot;worthy&quot; with what they have and tell them to leave.  Everybody with significant server kills have been involved in this same setup.<br>
<br>
Old Wraith and Old Vis fought each other till wraith disbanded and Vis nearly fell apart. It sucked.<br>
<br>
LC/Vis had their spat and started sharing.  Seemed to work good for them.<br>
<br>
We had our spat with LC and we started sharing.  Worked great for us, and with a few exceptions seems to make LC and Vis happy also.  <br>
<br>
Now Explicit is having their spat.   I am not top dog in Wraith, and I certainly wont' speak for LC and Vis.. but IMO it would be silly to not offer you guys a spot at the table.  You guys kill the majority of what we kill, and are getting better.  Everything esle is he said/she said bullshit.  <br>
<br>
Is the last few days how you *want* to play, or do you want to stop this crap?<br>

First thanks for apologizing to block the door in ogre form, it was unnecessary. Otherwise we didnt train each other when we both ran in initially, we just didn't deal with the traps properly and people died to the dots.<br>
<br>
Now I had no problems with Explicit running past us. We've competed before and the status quo has been to get ready and engage first. I'd like us to not be this confrontational but it hasn't come to be yet. We managed to get ready first and engaged like you said. The part you are wrong at is &quot;while we waited and watched&quot;. I'm sorry you are wrong and I can dig out logs and possibly screenshots showing soullance and few others running around in the room. We were fine till the mob reached 80 at which point the other golems in the room were trained. Although it is possible that someone in my raid messed up and agro'ed them but given the fact Explicit had ppl running around in the room, when they had no business being there, leads me to believe that either intentionally OR accidentally it was a explicit members.<br>
<br>
To all the Desi-haters in the room, Wassaaaaaap !!<br>

<br>
so...care to answer me yet? we have enough and we got run over, and your reason is we do not have 40 ppl on?  <br>
<br>
AOW..point is..40s ppl is pretty much max number for us...how do you expect us to show 40s guildmembers everytime we race with wraith before you decide to run us over becoz &quot;we think you dont have enough number&quot;?  Can you be any more unreasonable? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwarlordette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warlordette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>F Salta!!!</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/18/02 6:16:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=119>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Woow</span><hr size=1> Woow...<br>
<br>
IT isn't the point on wether you had less than us....the fact is, we had 54...you guys had in zone at the time 15.  Grant it..you guys were gradually getting more, but you only had 17 online...so what were we to think...it was our turn, you guys had cursed last week, so we were not going to let you guys try and stall out the cycle or stall in &quot;diplomatic&quot; conversation with desi or gm's...You guys wanna race....we were ready, we engaged...you didn't....alls fair in war eh?  <br>
<br>
next time you guys stall us...and engage....or maybe Gurunt and Gerwood will work something out...that would be the best thing...<br>

<br>
I didn't see what was going on for the fact that I was forced to look at the ground or the wall the entire time. So you may be right, I dunno...I can't discount that.<br>
<br>
Fact is this...those mobs WILL spawn again. There WILL be another day. Yeah those who read this and who know me from Lor Mani will say, OMG Alle is saying this. Fact is my perspective on alot of things has changed. Including this one. It's not worth arguing over. <br>
<br>
The cursed cycle thing was a good idea. We could have taken the first two and you guys had the last one. I dunno I was always taught to share with my sisters and to get along or I would be spending some time alone in my room. Same exact things I try to teach my children.<br>
<br>
Last night was horrid. There is no reason ANYONE should be giving themselves a coronary over a game. I think looking back, everyone did some pretty f*cked up things...yes everyone. So let's shake hands, grin and bear it, and as someone once told me....fake it. Fake it like you would fake an orgasm, because that's all this is. Take the petty shit to tells and move on.<br>

I was in MA from guild start to uber.  I was in VM from non-uber to uber....i would think i know where explicit is now. We are going up, but we are not there yet.  If we AE invite, why would we have problem getting 40 ppl to show wraith?  THINK!  No one expect to be instant uber, not any of us.  I am diff from you, i dont get invite into an uber guild and instantly become uber overnight. I work my way through.  I am frustrated becoz we had couple nasty run in with wraith, for no reason beside certain ppl.  never becoz we are not uber. i know the feeling to be on top, and i dont miss it. Or i would stay in VM finish using up my 700 something pts to get whatever i want to keep myself to be one of the top geared druid in all server.  I understand how frustrated you are now since wraith just passed VM, but no need to kick me down so you can feel better.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, exp's plan was to get close to top guilds in the server before POP without mass invite--it's never being uber instantly over night like how you put it.  i think we are doing pretty good in 4 months consider the only mob we havnt kill is BLood/Emp/Seru and VT.  Everything else...if other guilds can kill, we can. I am actualy pretty happy that we get this far so fast with so little ppl. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugerwood2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gerwood2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sebilite Golem</span><br>  Posts: 77<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/18/02 8:21:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Woow</span><hr size=1> &quot;Explicit just is not that big yet, Woow.

<br>
It's not pretty.&quot;   ...i usually dont do more then 2 responses to a thread, but man this reply warrants  a hardy laugh. Baaguk get a god damn clue. To start we didnt want more then a handful from vis...and didnt plan to gut anybody, we did ask. if we got turned down we looked other places...but zerg invite is nice description of the 50 or so invites we've given in our 5-6 months......We never planned to be uberest or even compete. WE WANTED TO HAVE FUN(my funnest moments in explicit are sont and dain when we had barely 25-30 total members).....vis was not fun, we moved on, so how about you do too ? maybe a little cheap shot...we've killed everything vis has except blood in that time. <br>
