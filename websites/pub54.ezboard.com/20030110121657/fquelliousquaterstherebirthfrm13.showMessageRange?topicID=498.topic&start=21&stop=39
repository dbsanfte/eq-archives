<br>
As some have said, there's only a few places where you can go in and shout LFG. You can't really do it in HS, CT, DN or UP, now, can you? Some places are hangouts, namely Sebilis and Velks, and grouping should be one of those &quot;because it's right&quot; things, just like NBG. In the Myco King room once, a Cobalt Bracer dropped. That's worth, what, 20k? More? We were all drooling at the thought of selling it, until the warrior spoke up and pointed out he IS a warrior and didn't have a Cobalt bracer. So the rest of us swallowed our greedy and /waved goodbye to 20k plat and let him have it.<br>
<br>
There's also a server imbalance. I've noticed a much larger congregation of people in Seb and Velks while on Xegony than on Quellious. Seems on Q people are more spread out and more people hunt on the moon, whereas the Xegony population is bunched more on Norrath. I guess every server is different.<br>
<br>
I've taken camps to PL, but always in out of the way places, and when the population is low. I've PLed a bunch of characters in Runnyeye because no one goes there. Ditto for the LGuk bedroom. I've seen LGuk with as few as 5 people in it, not including me. But when it fills up, I leave. I let people have the camps. But that's just me I guess.<br>
<br>
Well I've made my point, you've all made yours.

<br>
A 6 man group in portal is not exciting. Nor, really, is a 6 man group in upper spiders. Or many other camps in the xp hangouts. These camps are WAY trivial. I derive about . this much fun from camping NG with a 6-man &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; type group. It's vastly more interesting, for me at least, to hold down NG with a monk, a druid, and myself. Or king with a druid, monk, pally, and myself.  Or any number of other places where I not only survive, but thrive, on the xp that I get from trusting in my groupmates.<br>
<br>
Everquest is a pretty boring game when you're xp grinding. I've looked for ways to make it more interesting for me. Anyone telling me that I'm wrong for doing what makes my playing time more enjoyable can get stuffed. <br>
<br>
And FYI... yes. The reason I camp the way I camp is to, figuratively speaking, mount a mob's head over my fireplace. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's not just the xp.

If the camp is that easy for you,  move on to a harder zone and allow the non ubers access to these easy zones.  I mean there are like 50 people in Seb on the weekend so I pop over to CT and there are a whopping 7 people there including me.  If the ubers would catch a clue they could earn better exp elsewhere and make room for the up and comming 52-58 crowd that are always overlooked.  It ticks me off when people drag bodies to me for rez when there are a few lowbie clerics lfg at zone.  Fine, I accept that most people don't want to take a 90% rez when a 96% is avail, but it pisses me off that they won't even accept that lower level cleric into group in order to maximize their exp when soloing or partnering.<br>
<br>
As a 60 cleric I don't really have much trouble getting a group in seb but I wish the 60 crowd would move on to CT<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
As far a the whole NBG thing I am less willing to follow NBG rules due to the sheer number of alts out there.  I only play one toon and money is tight as a cleric.   If a person is obviously playing his main,  no problem with NBG, but if the group is talking about all their alts etc I am not willing to default items just so they can twink them.  Call me greedy if you like but I need upgrades as well.  The other day I was in ABC and I think the lowest level person there was a 59 BL.  A RGB dropped and we all rolled on it.  I don't feel bad about that due to the level of group and at 59 I expect the melee to have RBG level haste or better by that stage in their eq career.<br>
<br>
Of course rules need to be established when groups are formed, but are often overlooked due to group turnover.  Just the other day a wizzy friend of mine, Kabia, lost a roll on an ODS that she would have used, to a Bard who was gonna use it for her twink <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If you consider it a challenge to heal lots over a 60 second period and then sit for 8-9 minutes more power to you.  It's just funny to hear you ask the ubers to &quot;get a clue&quot; as to where the good exp is then go off to an ae group in a zone more crowded than CT where you have to fight for spawns and put up with incessant bitching in ooc and shout by people getting trained.  Sounds to me like you're adding to the problem that causes lack of spawns in an area rather than helping it.<br>
<br>
And you only told the leader you weren't coming after we pointed out in group chat that you were in FG as far as I know.  That's not the part I really care about though, it's more the fact that you came here and tried to blast the &quot;ubers&quot; for not having a clue about where the good exp is.<br>
<br>
Fact of the matter is CT takes a full balanced group.... these small groups you see monopolizing camps are doing so because they either don't have to time to get together a full group for another place or just don't want to put forth the effort to.  Why should I leave FG where I can get an aa point in 3 hours without any outside help to go join a group in CT that requires 5 other members that have an extended period of time to play?  Make no mistake, if I have a Saturday to play and I know I'll be on all day I'll surely take a shot at it, but I tend to get shit exp while people afk, go ld, have to go and wait for a replacement etc when I could be killing a blue mob every 45 seconds and getting the full exp for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufanainy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fanainy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/12/02 5:34:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=498.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> salt</span><hr size=1> <br>
Jesus if you want to dicsect (sp??) what I said in one section of my reply,  perhaps you should look closer at the entire post.  I stated that I tried to send the group leader a tell indicating that I wasn't coming, but he was not in game.  Ergo he never got the tell due to ld or whatever.<br>
<br>
As far as my comments about the uber's catching a clue, that was directed to the overcrowding of Velks and Seb.  Granted FG was mentioned in the initial post on page one, but my comments were directed to the level 60 crowd that are soloing/partnering camps that can be held by a group of lower level characters.  I would love for CT to become the next Seb for level 60's.  My rather limited experience in CT is that once someone decides to leave, the group is shot because no alternatives are waiting at zone in.  The few times I have zoned into CT looking for a pick up group I never found one.  Perhaps I will take my own advice and spend more time there.<br>
<br>
As far as FG goes,  I don't see many people there trying to make conventional groups.

<br>
BULLSHIT.<br>
<br>
50 people in the zone looking for a camp and four camps have been folded into two? What garbage. Unfortunately, my group wasn't willing to take a stand despite my insistance we grab D2.<br>

When people got better gear from Luclin. Better gear + levels = being able to handle more mobs.<br>
<br>
If a group can take more mobs, they more than likely will.<br>

Ok, so a few people with NTOV and a buttload of AA points can own a camp, and a group of 6 can take two.<br>
<br>
My contention remains that just because you can doesn't mean you should. Sebilis had 50 people in it on Friday. Those people should step aside and let another group take the camp. And if they say we should go somewhere else, like Chardok, I say, no YOU leave, if you're so strong, and go to Cazic Thule or UP.<br>
<br>
Really, I'm more ticked that my group wouldn't take a stand. They were content to roam DHall looking for straglers rather than demand the disco group split a camp, or that we take bar/arm and the other group take just chef.<br>
<br>
And if you're wondering why I, a druid, am so militant about grouping in Sebilis, where most of us are perpetually LFG along with the mages, necros and SKs, I do have my reasons. Having been away for four months I gotta get acquainted with new high level peeps and such. Grouping in Sebilis is still the best getting-to-know-you place in the game. Grouping in Seb is how you get to know people and eventually find a new guild, which is why I'd rather be in a group, getting 1% aa every 15 minutes rather than 4% per quad in ME. <br>
<br>
Of course, starting an arguement is no way to make friends, but hey... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
On a side note: I went to LGuk last night to get a Mithril Runed Tunic, since it has Spell Haste II and the SH III items are nodrop and super expensive. While there, Frenzy sat uncamped for the whole 2 hours. That HAS to be a record. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=498.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=498.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=498.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=498.topic&index=39><img src=http://quellious-collective.com/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=498.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=498.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=498.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=498.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm23">Archives-General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm24">Archives-Flames</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
