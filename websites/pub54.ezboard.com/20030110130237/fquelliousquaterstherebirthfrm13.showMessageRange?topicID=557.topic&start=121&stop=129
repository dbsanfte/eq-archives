Is it just me or is that one hypocritic post? Just to clear up some of this cloudy vision you have Transkor. You dont know Wraith, you didnt know LC or VM back then,you dont know what went on back then, so how bout STFU? No one disbanded, no one left the zone after the Myga situation, and Wraith wasnt run by any ex-Descent. The only thing you manage to peg right was I was leader of Wraith. So do us all a favor and and try and comment on something you might of been a part of or might have some knowledge about. VM and LC already had an undertsanding or somesuch, Wraith was never fookeredas you put it, we went our own way as usual, and as we do now. Clowns like you twisting facts about something you havent a single clue about is what keeps people at each other's throats. So read your last paragraph in your response and take your own advice. <br>
<br>
... wow a leader of a guild and so oblivious to the world around you lol.  No wonder Desi does all your work for you.  I seriously hope you appreciate his work.  I was never a Wraith recruit, so you are wrong in that part of your retort, thou had I been a recruit I may just have had &quot;some knowledge about&quot; Wraith so I'm not sure why you said both those things.  I've known people in wraith since just about as long as I can remember, and I remember plenty quitting EQ from your lack of character.<br>
<br>
But this wasn't about you, or the specific instances that were but examples.  My point was that ego-jackasses like you have woven so much of this inter-guild hatred and you can't even admit it to yourself.  But whatever bro, go back to your land where it doesn't rain and you're some really cool guy that meets up with EQ ladies and shows them your stuff lol.<br>
<br>
And Velsharen... lol whatever, do you wear that dress out in RL too?  God knows you were nothing but a total cock to me when I was in LC, makes me sad that I pushed for your recruitment.  Or did you fail to remember that part too smackass?  /sigh.  Still showing up nice and late just in time to grab loot? rofl.  hey why not, other fine chanters like Escad, Salta, etc. can cover for you while you slack.  That's fair enuff right?  Hey, did you cyber with Dunze too?  That might explain alot. <p>Master Transkor "<a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=96394>LazyChanter</a>" Provocateur, 60 Transmuter.<BR>

I seem to remember you being good friends with Dunze for awhile too, does that mean the totally uncalled for email you wrote that was LACED with your biased interpretation of things was out of line? You remember, the one that was a feeble attempt to shake the core of our guild because things didn't go your way?  And to think, you called Dunze a friend at one time, along with your ex-guild. Talk about being ashamed of supporting someones recruiting.  Hmm.<br>
<br>
You left LC on horribly bad terms, what do you expect a member to treat you like now? I'm only writing this as a response to what you are writing, don't think this is unprovoked. Oh yah, feel free to call my character out for question after reading this too, my mud is laced with hydrochloric acid, I'll sling your fucking eyes out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

Nah,not at all. Guess you live my life dont you? So you know better once again. I know this game has its share of low lifes like you that stir trouble whenever they can, because they get some kick out of it. Hence your first response to this thread. You blast 2 guilds and people in your post then tell people to grow up, Hello? Hypocrit. Dont take a genius to peg you for what you are. As for Desi, damn straight im appreciative of what he does, but once again you dont know shit about shit. Theres also other officers that run that guild, and you know what they do their load of the work if not more as well. Whether or not you were a Wraith recruit is pointless I remember you asking asshole so dont try and make yourself look better by denying it now, unlike you I do post what I know to be true not my assumptions. Try it, you might not embarrass yourself like you managed to do in this thread.<br>
<br>
As for people leaving Wraith over me, I have no doubt they did. Is there a point of you bringing this up? Every guild out there has had someone leave over an officer/leader. But if I lack such character why is Wraith back again? Why is Wraith sucessful? Surely if im such a bad person no one would want to join Wraith, specially good players. Gonna toss some more advice at ya, why dont you worry bout whats going on in VM and ill worry bout Wraith.<br>
<br>
You also go on to say this wasnt about me, well dont address me fool if its not about me. Let me give you a bit of advice, go look up the word egotistical before you use it. Im far from egotistical bud, im sure I can be labeled a jackass at times, I wont deny that. But I have no problem admitting my flaws, and never will. As you say &quot;But whatever bro, go back to your land where it doesn't rain and you're some really cool guy that meets up with EQ ladies and shows them your stuff lol.&quot; I never left where my &quot;land&quot; and not only does it rain, it snows here to, guess it isnt so perfect after all, poor me. And as for some really cool guy, I let others be the judge of that, I may or may not be in my opinion. As for meeting EQ ladies and show them my stuff, maybe be a bit more descriptive there bud. And funny you bring that up, can you say Hypocrit again? We both know what im talking about <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . And ive met alot of people in EQ and plan to meet more, if thats such a bad thing, why do you do it? I guess your trying to air some kind of dirty laundy you think I have, try again, theres nothing im ashamed of that youd ever know about asshole. Bye bye, maybe one of these days when you remove your head from your ass, you might post somethig factual.<br>
