 Also, the list wont work until you can include every rage needing cleric on the server, as it stands now only those that are in your circle of friends that made the list stand to gain much. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ukeldoreth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keldoreth</A> at: 6/5/02 12:57:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usfemwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>S Femwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of Beer</span><br>  Posts: 270<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/5/02 1:01:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Waiting List?</span><hr size=1> As far as I know the list isnt comprised from a circle of friends, i believe its been stated over and over again that all you have to do is go to sf and talk to the cleric camping it.<br>

I'm very glad I found it. I will try and keep my comments brief as I know long posts tend to get ignored.<br>
<br>
To Feadorn (and hopefully the officers of ADD):<br>
If you rest on the laurels of previous GM decisions and to some degree the PnP policy, you are certainly correct in saying that the first party with forces sufficient to complete the encounter will (not necessarily &quot;should&quot;) be the one awarded the kill/loot. While previous actions could, due to human nature, warrant a more merciless/legalistic approach to managing these encounters, I would implore you to examine the events that have taken place on this server in the past few months and appreciate the evolution of order that has grown in SF amongst these clerics (and guilds).<br>
<br>
As many have already said, this is (in practice), not a list. I have seen examples on other servers and when that list reaches 70 people, the natural inclination is to take the approach you have already proposed. I have lobbied hard (to some success I might add), to keep the list below 10 to avoid just such a scenario. What has evolved is much better than a list. it is a small alliance of priests (gender neutral for those PC folks out there &lt;g&gt;) that are committed to helping each other complete what is a very unreasonable encounter.<br>
<br>
While your guild is within its right (according to game rules) to contest that spawn and attempt to compete with that evolved order, I would encourage you to embrace it, participate and (heaven forbid) maybe let this encounter creep into other similar encounters (PoF Wraith being a great example) and try and ressurrect (pardon the pun) the semblance of order that existed prior to the original QQ's demise.<br>
<br>
The work that I have seen with Jeannie, Sassami, Gruff, Bennea, Batto, and Syllie has been truly one of the better experiences for me in the game. After hopefully completing my epic, I will consistently try and make myself and members of my guild that are available participants in this system as I think it is a terrific example of what human cooperation can be.<br>
<br>
In closing, I'm not asking for half a day to gather the forces necessary to complete my ragefire encounter, merely that you respect (hopefully participate) the level of cooperation that exists currently and grant the camping cleric (in this case, of course being me) REASONABLE opportunity to raise a force sufficient to kill both forms. Per our conversation, I do not believe 10 minutes is sufficient time. Nor do I think 2 hours is reasonable for me to monopolize a spawn. While I would love for ADD to assist in these efforts, in lieu of that I would at least ask that you respect the time that has been invested and permit myself (and future clerics) a fair chance at completing their epic. If we fail in that endeavor, your guild (and any others for that reason) is well within your rights to pursue closure in light of my failure. Of course, I'll never refuse assistance (even in the case of failure) to complete the encounter.<br>

<br>
However, I want to reinforce one point made earlier by two of my officers.<br>
<br>
If Rage pops, and the cleric currently at the top of the list needs help, please feel free to ask for DoSG's help. We're a mainly GMT based guild (although apparently we have a noticable presence most of the day now, lol), so might be a good resource if he pops out of some people's regular playtime.<br>
<br>
We as a guild want to do everything we can to foster the idea of people co-operating and helping each other with things like this - I know realistically it's impossible to achieve niceness everywhere, but it's got to be worth a try. <p><body>

ADD havent got a Ragefire pop since Mitsy got her epic. I would say thats at least 8 months ago, maybe over a year. It was before i joined.<br>
<br>
We've tried, but had various reasons for not getting them. Now all of a sudden, this rule has been put in, and now we have to wait another few months before one of our clerics can camp Rage, then another few months for another. Thats assuming the guilds that dont obbey by these rules/dont read this site dont come and take it. If they dont read this board, they're not gonna care how much you flame.<br>
<br>
What Feadorn is implying, is that if the epic is a priority to the said clerics guild/friends, then if you REALLY wanna camp it, then the whole guild/friends should camp it. If you cant get the support, then its obviously not a high priority and this stupid list that not everyone reads and obeys should be scrapped.<br>
<br>
And dont go on about level being a reason not to have epic. There isnt a rule to say when you should get your epic (unless you made one?). I know several clerics that got their epic before 56, and i know even more other classes with epics before 60. If the said person works hard enough for their epic, they shouldnt be told they cant get their final piece cus they're not 60.<br>

Basically, when your turn to camp Rage comes, you're basically (from what I've been told) expected to be there 24/7... and should have a decent showing of people there with you.  This isnt done for any other reason than to discourage others from moving in and attempting to take over.  The whole thing with this current camp is that a group of clerics (most of whom did NOT know each other prior to the camp)  who banded together and are working with each other to get their epics.  They are literally spending weeks together... rotating shifts, etc.  And you can be sure that when Rage is scheduled to pop, they have a force ready.<br>
<br>
And Blal... you mention 8 months.  Let's put that into perspective please.  Rage hasnt been in SF for 8 months... so I cant comment on why ADD didnt get him back during the old SolB camp.  The new Rage had been broken for about 2 months from what I remember... so not only has ADDnot gotten a lot of clickers... no one else has either.  LM has 2 Cleric epics total... the first was Thoras... whom I believe was the 3rd epic on the server.  The second was Bralan... who got his well over a year ago in SolB.  By using your logic, I could easily say &quot;Hey!  Why are there 2 LC clerics ahead of Syllie when LC already has clickers galore?&quot;.  Answer?  Who cares?  They are putting in their time, and helping the other clerics.... even the non-LC ones.  Syllie has been 60 for months, and has been ready for Rage for close to a year now.  Yet not only DOESNT she complain, she's trying to help where necessary.<br>
<br>
My issue was with Feadorn, and his attitude.  Period.  From what I was told (by people who were there, and whom I trust), he walked in to SF, and started badgering DocLotus and the other clerics.  This was low class.  Period.<br>
<br>
I spoke to Garrador about this, and during our conversation, was informed that ADD has no intention of respecting the list.  That's fine... seriously.  As said from the beginning, this was never &quot;official&quot;.  It's a gentleman's agreement of clerics dedicated to helping each other.  If ADD, or anyone else, dont care to follow suit, that's well within their rights.... but it in no way excuses Faedorn or his actions.<br>
<br>
He had no excuse.  No whatsoever.<br>
<br>
But in all fairness... I'm throwing him to the head of the list... my list.  The list of &quot;People I wouldnt piss on you if they were on fire&quot;. <p><center>

I did not hide anything.  I have also let my feelings be felt on this thread.  I dont like the fact that a few have started a list, or reservation system.  I dont like the fact that those few are the ones who are creating the rules for it.  Rules that allow a guild to reserve a spot for a cleric to be named later.  A rule that the you dont want the list to grow beyond 10.  What happens when cleric number 11 comes along?  Does he/she need to camp for the next rage just so that they can be put on the list next?  Your are correct, you have created a small alliance of priests and ignoring the bigger picture.<br>
<br>
Lauriston, No one from my guild will flame anyone on this thread... this is not the Flame Forum.  We will not engage in posts like one other has so far in this thread.<br>
<br>
Blal, its has been more than 18 months since mitsy got her epic.  It was done with the Sol B Rage Fire.  The Ragefire that got lost in the wall.  I have been playing this game for nearly three years now.  Just because this character is only 54 means nothing when going after an epic.<br>
<br>
Salta, You are correct, your guild can move fast...but if there is a guild already there, it could take as little as 6 seconds to kill Rage.  <br>
<br>
Quasqueton, Mitsy is the ONLY cleric that our guild has gotten a click stick for.  The SF Rage has been broken for a lot longer than 2 months..more like 8 or so.  I can look up when it was changed if you would like.<br>

I did not walk into SF and badger Doclotus.  He sent me a tell and i thought it prudent to be upfront with him about my intentions...  I did not want to hide anything from him.. I also did not send a tell to ANY of the other clerics that were there.  I was only talking to Doclotus.  Please tell me what i did wrong by letting him know my intentions after he sent me a tell?  I have logs if you wish to see, and doclotus can confirm their accuracy.<br>
<br>
**EDIT**<br>
Bennea did send me a tell and we talked a bit.  I told her the samething that i told doclotus as well as my statments that I have made on this msg board.<br>

<br>
let's start with common ground, <br>
<br>
this set up by VI is FUBAR<br>
<br>
MANY clerics and guilds want this dumb mob<br>
<br>
Sufficient force is the policy that is heavily bantered, but the equally stupid &quot;be-nice&quot; policy is heavily ignored.<br>
<br>
<br>
My hope is that this can rise above a playground level mentality.  Is what the clerics are trying to do flawed? yep.  But how about offering solutions?  I have offered my help, when i'm in game, for what it is worth.<br>

&quot;I spoke to Garrador about this, and during our conversation, was informed that ADD has no intention of respecting the list.&quot;<br>
<br>
I did not say we dont respect the list, I told you that we would give sufficient time for the person on the head of the list to get folks together....if you cant get folks to sit with the cleric and/or be there in ten minutes, then its unfair for folks to try and delay a group of people already amassed to take Ragefire.<br>
<br>
While I do aggree the list has its good intentions, its unfair for folks to try and set precedent and expect others across the server to follow suit. <br>
<br>
And also folks kiting a mob does not constitute ownership. <br>
<br>
While I have nothing against Doclotus or any other clerics on that list I will defend my guilds rights to try and acquire the cleric epic and try to do it with some form of decency and fairness. <br>
<br>
I was never a big fan of the old list system, the last I looked I also pay for the game and would like to accomplish things as well. Not trying to buck the system, but as long as I have supporters in my guild and out of my guild I will do what it takes to accomplish certain things in this game short of being a total @#%$ or illegal.<br>
<br>
As you all have noticed not one ADD member has flamed anybody so far on this subject.....and rightfully so because this is a general discussion area. The whole misconception that all of ADD is a bunch of asses is a total farce.<br>
<br>
Every guild has had their share of bad apples, and up until recently we had a good bushell of them. But that is changing and we are trying to be more proactive with regards to recruiting and such.<br>
<br>
So we shall see what the next ragefire spawn brings us and I wish all the clercs good luck on getting their epic. This spawn has been one of the worst things I have seen in this game since I started playing very long ago. <p>Garaddor Ghoulbane

<br>
I'm not accusing Feadorn of doing anything wrong. As he mentioned, he and I sent tells back and forth with him explaining his intentions. It was cordial and no ill will was tempered by either party.<br>
<br>
I do disagree with his assertion that 10 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to permit a person to assemble a suitable force to complete the encounter. As I have already stated, neither do I expect 2 hours to be considered a reasonable time.<br>
<br>
If this we're a daily spawn like say, Faydiddy in TD for the druid epic, I'd be more inclined to agree that 10 minutes is closer to a reasonable amount of time. All I ask is that ADD (or any other guild for that matter), allow the cleric that has invested a substantial amount of time and effort in this camp a reasonable window to garner the forces necessary.<br>
<br>
To Feadorn,<br>
<br>
As I explained in my previous post, I DO see the larger picture here, and hence why these efforts from multiple guilds currently exist. This camp is broken at best, and infuriating in general. The order that has evolved from this has run successfully for over 2 months. The fact that you were added to the list at one point I would hope indicated at least a measure of faith in the idea that this system might just work. The larger picture being that when you have over 4000 players on one server and an encounter as broken as this one, any attempt to create an air of cooperation and order should be encouraged.<br>
<br>
As for the 11th cleric. My words to them are, be patient and check in often. I did the exact same prior to Sassami completing her epic. Rather than just asking to be added to the list, I managed my affairs in such a way to permit me time to work with the clerics in the zone on a regular basis. I work full time and actually do attempt a life outside this god forsaken game but with all things, if you want it bad enough you make time for it. And thus here I am.<br>
<br>
My only disappointment in your (and your leader's) post is your decision to not allow this effort to try and work by participating in it, instead effectively stalking it. You are well within your rights and I appreciate your honesty in engaging me on this. However, I think you may find that if you give this a chance, it will benefit everyone involved, including yourself.<br>

<br>
I am a lvl 53 cleric (after 4 months in 52), and have been playing for a year now.  <br>
<br>
Now that you all have an idea of my &quot;status&quot; of how long i've been around, let me comment on a few things.<br>
<br>
1)  ANY cleric that does not know about this board has NOT done sufficient research on our EPIC. (thats how I found this place)<br>
<br>
2)  In reviewing the steps needed, and personal testing, it SUCKS that a cleric CANT solo ANY part of our epic, (RM? ya right!... sol b.. ROFL) except some of the turn-in mobs.<br>
<br>
3)  IMHO, albeit somewhat limited, the cleric epic IS the end-all/be-all of epics.<br>
<br>
4)  In my year of being a cleric, I have learned alot about the types of people who play this game... Basically, there are 4 types: a) plain upfront a$$holes b) A$$holes who backstab ya, then admit it c) Nice guys who MAY backstab ya but deny it AND d) the &quot;nice&quot; guy - gets stepped on EVERYTIME they try to do something nice, to help everyone.<br>
<br>
(I consider myself a &quot;d&quot; person)<br>
<br>
5)  The THOUGHT of a group of people, from different countries, races, religions and moral's working together to acheive the same goal and outcome, in a civil manner ..... MORTIFIES me!!  MY GOD, what's next? world peace? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
6)  ANY person who walks in, and claims the ability to do whatever/whenever (may be &quot;technically correct&quot;) is just plain  IGNORANT.<br>
<br>
(whether or not it's true) the thought of someone such as feadorn (sp?) having this &quot;capacity&quot; for selfishness, scares the @#%$ out of me.  <br>
<br>
When did HUMANITY lose all sense of dignity and respect?<br>
(don't sit there and spout about this being a game - the SETTING is a game, the actions ARE real?)<br>
<br>
PS...<br>
Its people who have the (alleged) lack of respect for others, that keep me from even starting my epic.  Clerics like that, are what give us as bad a reputation as druids have.<br>
<br>
No, I refuse to get my epic for quite some time, I cant bring myself to even think about trying to gank a mob that would be almost (if not more) contested than the sleeper (if he was respawnable). <p>Impudent Blasphemy<BR>

The list was started by players and for the players, please dont expect to have everybody fit into your world as you all see fit. <br>
Granted its a highly contested spawn, the worst in the game, but to assume that your list should be the end all to end all is ludicrous.<br>
We all want to accomplish certain things in this game as well, its this damn bottleneck which really sucks.<br>
<br>
But to say I am stalking it then thats really not fair to myself or others who feel the list isnt even fair. Its only fair to those that want to participate in it. Like I told Quas, we will give you sufficient time to gather your forces, if not then the group with the most people and sufficient force in the zone has the rights to said mob.<br>
<br>
I am not trying to be a jerk, and I am more than willing to work with you all within reason that I feel is sufficient for myself and my guild. But this whole point might be moot cause with my guilds luck , Rage will spawn at 4am in the morning when the European and Asian guilds are online anyways. <br>

<br>
The fact that a group of people can come in , create a list and then claim a mob is simply ludicrous. I know a list hopefully would cut down on certain butting of the heads, but it also isnt practical.<br>
<br>
That would be like saying that I can sit my arse in Sshrae temple, and claim Rhag 1 and start a list for that mob, meanwhile it takes my guild two hours to get their, but LC zones in and wants the mob etc. I would be daft to assume that they should wait for us to assemble our folks , within reason of course.<br>
<br>
And please dont assume that we all should run roughshod over all people, their should also be a certain tolerance, but also the folks who recieve said tolerance should also know when a certain event is taking too long to happen (i.e. getting a capable force to said mob to kill it).<br>
<br>
Overall, what it comes down to is the fact that the person(s) who apply themselves and put in the most effort hopefully win out in the end. If a guild or a group camp the mob and have sufficient force on hand then where is the problem with that.<br>
<br>
Creating a list and camping a mob for days on end doesnt constitute ownership, granted we all would like to think that there would be some form of decorum, but in the end &quot;Its not the big that eat the small, but the fast that eat the slow&quot;. So gather your forces and lets see what happens.<br>
