Wow that's some stroke of genius on your part, grats.  Batuda didn't ask me to post this, our guild thought on the whole that Moncleared did something that was pretty downright retarded and some jokingly said &quot;go flame his stupid ass Salta&quot;.<br>
<br>
I remember when I used to group with you in seb and you were always an annoying little fucktard but where have I ever said one word against you before now?  Oh that's right nowhere... you're just this sad little guildhopping pain in the ass who just now feels the need to speak out against me (oh please take me back rel in por I didn't mean to leave you guys for Wraith cuz I didn't realize Wraith would reject me the first time).<br>
<br>
Call me immature, call me ignorant, call me whatever you'd like... I'm not the annoying little rogue who spews vulgarities in ooc to people I hardly even know.  I'm also not the person from a guild who allows people of such character as Moncleared to remain amongst its ranks.  Please spare me from the &quot;you must be 13 years old blah blah blah bs&quot;.  At least come up with something more creative than that.  For a 13 year old I surely do know how to form complete sentences and use proper grammar a tad better than you.  <br>
<br>
You should really try and emulate the style of Gurunt there Citto... you wouldn't come across nearly as moronic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uledronesoultaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ledrone Soultaker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/28/02 7:26:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=423.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> /shrug we had 80-85 maybe(?)

<br>
The really funny part about it is you show that you don't even know what zerging is lol. Going in with 45 people and ressing everyone back into the fight 3 times is zerging, killing soemthing outright with a higher number isnt. Who cares though? You kill what you kill, we'll kill what we kill. I have no doubt that many of the mobs we both kill can be done with fewer numbers than we have killed them with, but are you going to be the one that tells your guildmates they cant come because &quot;people might call us zergs if we have too many!&quot;?

Thats a good one, your just a little loud mouth punk who does nothing but try to antagonize others in public channels. Now he has his little pedestal here in the flame boards &lt;clap salta&gt;. If it makes you feel like a bigger man go for it little kid. Hog your limelight with your witless insults. All I find is them entertaining and just show what kind of true character you have. Yes even the ones that bash Wraith which seem to be your favorite subject.<br>
<br>
As usual sounds like Wraith/Rev has been put to a challenge by Salta and his cronie buddy another big mouth Ishan. Hmm lets recall a few events here. Salta makes a big ordeal of AoW being ninja looted, granted ill give that to him, id be pretty pissed if one of those weasels looted AoW on us to. But good old Salta just dont know when to stop beating a dead horse. Dont recall the specifics but Desaran aka Tenalin was just being himself made a smart ass comment to Salta. So Salta in his all knowing, future-seeing, holier than thou, shitty ass attitude goes on to say. Like Wraith will ever kill AoW. 4 attempts, dead AoW. Whoa Saltboy wrong? Cant be, im just imagining all this AoW loot in guild, cuz goold old Saltboy said we couldnt, and he knows everything right? Heh wrong.<br>
<br>
So Saltboy doesnt learn his lesson from the 1st situation when he needed to insert foot in mouth, and swallow his pride. Noooooo he issues another challenge, Why? Good question, lack of intelligence, and pure idiocy are probably good reasons why, but im going out on a limb here by assuming that. So the second challenge was Vyz the cursed. Wraith dont stand a chance, No way in hell, all we are is a buncha stupid Zergs. Zergs that only beat mobs by pure numbers. Well Saltboy, second attempt on Vyz the cursed and dead snake.Saltboy wrong again? Has hell frozen over? Is Armageddon coming, cuz no way did this just happen. Mr. Perfection, Mr. Imbetterthaneverybody wrong a second time, that just cant be.<br>
<br>
So now is this a third challenge with us and the Emperor? You really dont think we can pull this one off? Nothing wrong with putting a big mouth, moron in his place like you as usual. Granted that we dont kill mobs for that reason, your just a spec of icing on the cake. Regardless of what you think, that we sit there and watch YOUR raids or go read the safehouse, we take care of business our way. Just another lame ass way of you trying to discredit what we do, because hell no you cant be wrong right? <br>
<br>
So before you continue to preach about how guild members represent Wraith. Maybe you need to look at yourself and how you reprsent LC here, and the next time we are in the zone before you start spouting off. Maybe keep that fat hole in your head that you call a mouth shut, and show you have a little class for once. But somehow I think thats a little to much for  you to grasp. <br>
<br>
And to just address the main issue of the post, you bet your ass Moncleared got reemed for that. Batuda being a pretty dang good guy, and him coming to one of the officers about what happened was how it got taken care of. Not good old Saltboy's attempt lame ass thread  to point out how much he is better than everyone and how much everyone does wrong while his @#%$ dont stink. And no we wouldnt condone that happening to anyone on the server, thats a pretty low stunt to pull. <br>
<br>
Lastly your the running joke of our guild Salta, many many many laughs come at your expense bud. So go on with your flames, and pick that pedestal up and set it back down and crawl back up on it. Cuz your the only one thats putting yourself on it, and your only giving us more to laugh about. Thanks for the laughs, what is it you say? Fuktard? <p><center><FONT COLOR="ffff00"><img

Go Go Denia!<br>
<br>
    Lotus Cult killing the Emporer is an awesome acomplishment, as soon as i heard i made it a point to make my congratulations known to all you guys...it is an awesome job man, you guys pulled it off and deserve the utmost respect for it.  Bram came to Wraith site a couple of times to congratulate us on our firsts like AL and HP etc.  That is awesome, i really respect him for that.  Anyway, LC rocks is the point here!  Dont talk @#%$ about us saying we cant do something though, that just shows piss poor attitude, and makes people like me and others wanna try to start more @#%$.  Wraith rooted for you guys on every attempt and were very pleased when we saw you guys had completed what you set out to do.  Then we come here and see more jackass coments from Salta and his buddies, just leaves a poor taste ya know.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, btw Batuda rocks and im sorry about the altercation.  I never said it was right...ever...i just stated that there are usually 2 sides to the story.<br>

I've also never said you couldn't kill cursed (You really should check your sources because you're batting .000 so far and getting on here and posting blatant lies you have exactly zero evidence for isn't exactly bright).  So all this big bad talk about proving Salta wrong just seems to be you blowing a bunch of hot air.  If you need to use the non-existent words I've said as motivation to work harder and stuff then congrats... I guess we use whatever works.  <br>
<br>
I don't deny Wraith has the skill to take down the big mobs.  Any literate person can see you've defeated most of the major content in vellious and luclin and that's no easy feat.  However, if the jokes I make really have no basis then there's really nothing to be offended over is there?  That's okay, we all saw Desi's posts on the safehouse specifically asking how to do Tunare and we had a big laugh about it.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for letting me know your entire guild laughs at me... I'll remember that the next time that random_member_01 asks me for c3 and I'll kindly tell them to go screw themselves.  I haven't ever let the exchanges on these boards interfere with how I dealt with people in game... you've just given me every reason to change that.  <br>
<br>
The really ironic part is that just about everyone I know considers you to be a complete ass Droz.  Forgive me if I don't put too much value on your words... I don't put much stock into the words of someone who has posted nothing but lies about words I haven't even said.  Just fyi I did talk to Gurunt about this, I merely posted it here so everyone else could see what a complete jackass Moncleared was.  Once again you display the fact that you are completely uninformed and lacking actual knowledge about the situation.  Thanks for confirming your ignorance in the matter. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=Blue>Moderator</font></span><br>  Posts: 352<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/28/02 9:25:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=423.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Speaking of lame...</span><hr size=1> The only comment you've got any sort of business reeming me for was the one about not seeing Wraith in VT at the beginning of this thread.  I only made it in retaliation to Moncleared's dumbass comments in ooc earlier that day where he directly dissed on our numbers for killing emp.  In this case you seem to think it's okay for him to make dumbass comments like that but when I make a comment in response I'm being high and mighty.  Go go your logic.<br>

He has a history of being a disruptive influence on the server. I guess he has found the a place where it's ok to do whatever you like and continue to be supported. <br>
While all guilds have people who can run their mouths off well. There aren't many that have people who can represent themselves as well as Moncleared does. I just feel sorry for the decent people who get thrown into generalizations that occur from being associated with classy individuals such as Moncleared. And the people his actions directly hurt.<br>
What he is going to appologize for next time?<br>

Its morons like you that make the game not fun.   I supose you will say its just a joke, but I dont see it as one.<br>
<br>
This is a problem that accured between Batuda and Moncleared, but moronic idiots like you want to make it something between Wraith and LC.<br>
<br>
Grow up, you really need to get out of your house once a month and find some happiness, becasue your bitter attitude is pathetic. <p><br><br><center><img src="http://mms.uni-hamburg.de/meyer/seminare/matrix/img/bluepill.jpg">

Salta's comments about number of LC in ssrae and Seeing Moncle in VT were directed at him not at Wraith.  Out of all the replies on this thread though i have to give credit to Moncle for being the most reasonable and mature. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143487">

<br>
Ishan, on the other hand has nothing positive to say about anything.  He is a rude person, with the attitude of a spoiled brat.   he likes to make comments, then when he is called on it says &quot;I was joking&quot;.<br>
<br>
The comment  is innappropriate, and is a attack on the abilities of all Wraith and Reviverance members.   Just becaue LC killed a mob first on teh server gives him no right to say that we need to learn from someone else.    I could care less if desi posted on some other board seeking help with Tunare.  Learning that sometimes you need to ask for help is the sign of a good raid leader.<br>
<br>
I know Ishan has never asked for help, and can do anything solo.   I bet he came up with the entire plan for emp all by himself, without reading any spoiler info. <br>
<br>
Sigh, go ahead and say &quot;thats just Ishan&quot; when he acts in the manner of a 5 yr old without his ritalin. but it rerflects on all the members when he can do so unchecked. <p><br><br><center><img src="http://mms.uni-hamburg.de/meyer/seminare/matrix/img/bluepill.jpg">
