But I for one dont try to come off sounding holier than thou, and try to preach how thinsg should be because the fifteen people who post on this board say its the gospel.<br>
<br>
You all make me laugh and feel sick at the same time. Most of you folks climb up on your soapboxes and scream and scream, but act like you never done anything wrong or stepped on anybodys toes to accomplish something....I say HA!!!!.<br>
<br>
Yes, you can sling all your insults and fling your vulgarities at me all you want, the minute I do it then I am trailer trash....how pathetic. Maybe you should take a good look at yourselves in the mirror as we have been told to do so lately. You are all one sided and only see things in black and white.<br>
<br>
And for your information Banelion did try to contact Tristadorn repeatedly and even suggested to random the mob but Tristadorn said no way. But now you all will tell me that why should they have randomed the mob. Being in a Plane or in any zone for that matter, does not constitute ownership of a mob in no way shape or form. But now you all will say well what about Radiant they were there first etc. Well what about when GM came and made us random on Ragefire.....its the same freaking thing. It was a contested mob and this time Radiant was found lacking in any attempt to come to an agreement. Turn about is fair play.<br>
<br>
Now I know what will happen by you folks. You most likely for the next few weeks will become ADD snipers and take shots at us, so be it, its the nature of the beast.<br>

If you want discussion then move it to such, if you want flames than keep it here, matters not to me. BTW my last post on this subject so have at it. <br>

However this time I feel like saying a few things.<br>
<br>
1. If a guild is in a zone and clearing a path to a specific mob, then that guild has first rights to that mob. I don't care what arguments you are trying to use to justify running behind a guild, it's just plain <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   WRONG</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
2. I was near the Raegfire camp when Radiant <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   WON</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the roll against ADD. A GM-Admin and Guide was there and made both parties ROLL. Radiant Rolled a 31, and ADD Rolled a 30. Therefore the GM-Admin said Ragefire was to be awarded to Radiant FIRST. I only know this because I was trying to time Ragefire for our guild cleric Resa. (Resa ended up getting Ragefire a week later -- Gratz Resa).<br>
<br>
3. By looking at the logs that were posted on this forum and from the ADD Member admitting that Radiant was in the Plane of Fear first, it's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   CLEAR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to me that ADD Infact KSed Radiant <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   AFTER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Radiant cleared to the Wraith, and PULLED the wraith.<br>
<br>
Those are just my opinions from reading this thread.<br>

So what are you saying here?? Two wrongs make a right?  That it is ok to KS Maeve and her raid for her epic because one of your friends got screwed over 8 times?  This is one of the most hypocritical things I have seen in quite some time.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Finally, I have to comment on Bips post regarding his pull. Based on your own comments and your log as posted, you were not in visual contact with the mob, nor with Verbo when he engaged. Isn't it likely that Verbo didn't know you had hit the mob, because you weren't within Verbo's, nor the Mob's, sight when Verbo engaged? I'm not giving excuses and I'm not making judgement. I'm only saying that from the evidence presented, it does not appear to me that Verbo &quot;stole&quot; aggro from you. How could he have known you had hit the mob when you weren't within his (and the mob's) sight when he engaged it? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Does this make Verbo correct?  Is just because he didn't see Bippity have aggro make stealing the mob acceptable?  <br>

Goraddor, I defy you to find one single insult I made toward you, that goaded you into calling me a *fuckface*.  I posted my opinion, without vulgarities, or specific name calling toward you or anyone else.  For someone who is supposedly the GL of a powerful guild, you are speaking with less maturity than my 15 year old daughter.<br>

Guys, it is bad enough we have those assmonkeys from Sullon Zek coming here to post, we don't need to start playing like them as well.  Have some respect for your fellow player.  Treat them as you wish to be treated.  Take the high road.<br>

What I AM saying is that Grim got screwed out of Rage 8 times, and all of them were &quot;legal&quot;, so maybe we should have empathy for him also.  Notice I didn't mention that Radiant was involved in two of those incidences?  Why?  because it's irrelevent to what my post DID mean.  It means that the PnP rules suck and when you've been screwed over numerous times due to abiding by the PnP rules and other Verant rulings (such as being forced to roll on Rage camp when Grim was clearly there first, as addmited by the other party) you tend to get to a point where you say &quot;Fine, if I have to live with the PnP then I am going to play by the PnP&quot;.  That was the jest of my entire post.  Don't twist it to mean something else, it's not a friendly thing to do, and you are wrong to do that.<br>
<br>
Second, regarding my comments on Bip's and Verbo's pull...<br>
<br>
You asked if that &quot;makes Verbo correct?&quot;   It doesn't make Verbo correct IF he knew he was KSing and did it on purpose anyway. But, by virtue of Bip's own comments Verbo didn't know Bip had engaged.  HOW could he have KNOWN Bip was engaging it, if he couldn't SEE Bip, because Bip wasn't nearby where he could see him?  If you come upon a mob and no one is around, and you engage, how can you possibly be KSing it? <br>
<br>
I'm wasn't there so I can't comment on what was known and unknown from my personal perspective.  I can only comment based on the testimonies posted here and none of them show any proof that Verant's rules were viloated.  If anything, the testimonies suggest that the rules were NOT violated.  <br>
<br>
But hey, maybe I am wrong in my interpetation.  If so, feel free to post the entire PnP and set me straight.  In the meantime please refrain from changing the meaning of my posts to something that fits your feelings.  I am discussing the situation based on Verant's published guidelines and the presumed honest testomony, not my opinion and not your feelings.   <br>
<br>
Let's be civil and not attack the people, just attack the rules that make this sort of thing happen.  Rules that suck.  Rules that Verant should have fixed a long, long time ago.  Rules that force people to live by the same sword they have died by. <br>

<br>
Raidiant was already there, already suffered loss of time due to CR for a quick and fast break-in, and had roamers pulled, and made it apparent to others on their intent of why they're in the zone.<br>
<br>
To gather other people to intentionally take advantage of the time other people have spent is plain and simply WRONG.  Regardless of VI's rulin in favor or not, we are people behind these characters.  Don't run over people in life.<br>
<br>
I have to admit, I'm really getting tired of hearing all these bad stories of ADD as of lately.  It seems I hear a new story about them KSing or some such at least once a week.  I've been witness to at least 3 of the occurrances.<br>
<br>
Are the folks in ADD doing this on purpose?  Is it part of their guild charter?  Most of us are grown, and we still have to put up with a neighborhood bully?  Why not do something nice for someone for a change??<br>
<br>
It's a shame to play a game to 'get away' from real life's trials and tribulations, to just have grief players try and ruin even that small time of leisure.  Kinda makes me want to take golf back up instead of playing EQ with people that enjoy ruining good times and fellowship.<br>
<br>
Knowing that what you have done is wrong is one thing.  Trying to find excuses and loopholes to make you feel good about yourself and trying to make others think that you are innocent when you do something wrong is kinda like going to AA and saying that you don't have a drinking problem.  The first step to recovery is admittance.<br>
<br>
I will be there for you the next time, Maeve..and I assure you, there will be no KSing...<br>
<br>
My heart goes out to those that wasted hours of your real life to help Maeve in Fear.<br>

Some of you say you can't beleive Banelion would do such a thing...  well, maybe it wasn't Bane... perhaps it was another ADD member with Bane's account that tried to use Bane's good reputation to get an accomodation that they would not get with thier own sullied one.<br>
<br>
Verbo, that's Neomorpheous's monk... sound's like he's learning the ADD way quite well.<br>
<br>
And as for Garaddor's promise not to post any more, well, by my calcualtions, we have anout 6 or 7 more posts in this thread before he'll ACTUALLY quit... <br>
<br>
&quot;We're getting stronger every day&quot;  seems to be the mantra of the ADD leadership.  You so desperately need to be &quot;stronger&quot;, want so badly to be &quot;uber&quot; that you're willing to do just about anything to get there.    Well, I just hope I'm playing, and perhaps even present what you finally cross the line and Verant disbands you and bans some accounts.   <p>Belhaven<BR>

Verbo knew damn well he was ksing.  He knew our entire guild was pulling toward the wraith, he knew we were prepared to kill it, and he knew that we had just gotten rid of all the mobs that were between the wraith and ourselves.  When you aggro someone's mob in an xp camp, do you say &quot;sorry I've got more aggro so you're @#%$ outta luck?&quot;  or do you respect the fact that they had all rights to that mob and let them have it like a decent person.  I know which one my friends and I do, but then, we seem to differ from ADD in a lot of ways.<br>
