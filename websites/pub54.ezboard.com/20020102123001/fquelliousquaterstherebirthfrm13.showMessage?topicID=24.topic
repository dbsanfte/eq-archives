When hunting in a group in Traknon Teeth.. And you claim to be camping all the Rare spawns in the zone.. Don't expect anyone to actually care about your claim.<br>
<br>
Sigra was up for 2 mins.. I pulled it.. Dott'd it.. rooted it.. (took my sweet time killing it).. Didn't see anyone around untill it had like 1 hitpoint left.. I looted the (5ac, 9str, 13dex) belt....  And you complain that I should give it to you?  Cause you were camping all the rare spawns?... Bah... Cry to someone else.. Or get about 10 more rangers to cover the zone...  <br>
<br>
I don't know who you think you are trying to say all spawns in the zone that pop / roam around are yours.. That's just Arrogant....  <br>
<br>
I hope you don't have such bad Sportsmen-ship with other games you play... You didn't get that rare spawn... just get over it and try again... geeze... <br>

Anyone that actually knows how TT rares work, would realise that those people had a legitimate claim to that spawn. They are the ones who probably spent hours killing froglok foragers and hunters to make it spawn. Then you come along, or it spawns close to you, so you grab it? Damn straight I can understand why they would be pissed at you.<br>
<br>
I actually question your sportsmanship and believe the arrogant actions here, are yours. Pretend you don't know how the rare cycles work all you want. You saw a named and pounced. You didn't ask if someone was doing the cycles. You are the selfish one in this. <p><table cellpadding=3 style=filter:glow(Color="LimeGreen")><tr><td><img src=http://www.ozemail.com.au/~ajleak/ty-sig-7.jpg border=0></td><td valign=center><font face=verdana size=-1 color=black>

I actually think its fun if there's 2 groups competing, simply because its like a race between pullers, AND things pop alot faster. BUT, if theres one p[erson, or a few people, who HAVENT been putting in the time and effort to kill the PHs, then DONT @#%$ TAKE THE NAMED!!! other people worked for that pop, not you! have some @#%$ respect! if you had been killing a PH for hours, and someone KSed the named simply because they saw it and didnt ask to see if it had popped for a reason...because people were killing the PHs, you would be @#%$ pissed. <br>
just because its a roamer does not make it fair game. if you know ANYTHING, and are just 1% of the WISe man you call yourself, then you should know, that a named isnt just going to stay up and roaming, someone killed that PH, and if they have any intelligence, will make sure no named popped before they leave. <br>
<br>
so @#%$ ASK if the PH/named chain is being camped! instead of KSing the people that have been pulling as fast as they can to get that named to pop!<br>
<br>
and to think that i thought you were a good guy, and better than this Oogobuk. i guess people like you are what give VM a bad name huh?  <p><B><FONT COLOR="#009900" SIZE=-1 TYPE="ARIAL"> ~Nitrouz Oxidiouz~ <FONT COLOR="#999999">Outrider of the 56th Summoned Arrow <BR> Proud Guildleader of Legendary Heroes<BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#009900">~Blazin Fyrestorme~ <FONT COLOR="#999999">Silent Hunter of the 53rd Path <BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#009900">~Vellix Velocitus~ <FONT COLOR="#999999">21 Woodie War<BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#009900">~Biig Phimpen~ <FONT COLOR="#999999">17 Troll SK</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/unitrouzoxidiouz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nitrouz Oxidiouz</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 4/23/01 12:49:09 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/urennhelm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rennhelm</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www3.sympatico.ca/jphoto/Files/redcross.bmp BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/23/01 2:55:39 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/jphoto/Files/Renn60.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Word to the Wise</span><hr size=1> I love working for hours and killing the placeholders to get a rare named spawn, just to have someone stroll in and see it, whack it, and think that's just dandy.<br>

I may have to disagree with the majority on this one. This is my experience with TT. <br>
<br>
<br>
I was camping/farming/exp'ing/fighting (whatever you wanna call it) in TT for about 8 hours once a week for a month or so back in January, I wanted my Iksar mask real bad...<br>
<br>
But anyway, There was usually two groups, sometimes just 1, sometimes 4...sometimes I even saw another bard or ranger just winging it solo. (We saved that bard once, poor guy) But Whenever someone came into zone and called camp check, me and my 2 friends, the usual Trio, always replied &quot;Well, We're currently pulling all the foragers and hunters we can find, and hopefully some named, but we're sure there is room for everybody&quot; (this was macro'ed) And that worked out real well. <br>
<br>
I was lucky to have a fantastic puller, and I mean it when I say we hardly ever missed a named. The ONLY thing we would freak out about or throw a fit over, was when someone tried to steal a named as in, it was agro'ed, being pulled to camp, and someone else tried to charm it, or agro it more and take it to their camp.<br>
<br>
My point is. To be honest. Everytime I run from EJ to Seb, I hit my tracking button. I've never had a name up on it, but if I did, You betcha I would selos to it, and see if its engaged (probably would be) if its just sitting there, Well yah -- I would take it. To me, a big open zone like that is different than a dungeon with a set spawn. <br>

yes, in the old days when there were several groups, it couldn't be claimed, and if theres more than 2 groups now, it cant be claimed. <br>
but it IS stealing, if less than 3 groups, and sum1 takes the named YOu caused to pop by exclusively illing that PH. you dont see it at all as wrong that someone would go and take a named that another group popped without having done any work yourself?<br>
<br>
i apologize for my ferocity, but pulling there fast and furious as i do, is fun, but very hard work. and when someone steals the named you worked so hard for, it ceases to be fun. you prbably wouldn't understand. the rangers do tho. and @#%$, i've only been intentionaly, and successfully KSed once there over a named... including when i've already aggroed it and pulling it.<br>

Of course I don't know the details so this is all heresay, but it sounds like Oogobuk pulled a named that was out and about wandering around, not stealing it from another group that had it incoming to camp.<br>
<br>
Yeah it sucks to be working for hours on a spawn and then have that happen. I've experienced it countless times from the stupid keyholding SKs in Befallen when I was level 9, to the Shin Lord, to Grimrot and on and on... but it happens. You gotta buck up. Hell I had the Live Grimrot version ninja looted from me today by some punk and I've camped Grimrot for 10 played days. Thats 240 (two hundred and forty!!) hours of my life just sitting on my ass for half of a quest! But I just smiled, shrugged, said 'oh well, another day' and went back to socializing with my friends.<br>
<br>
Not having played this game for 6 months has really put me in an objective point of view. If you think about it, whether or not you get that named, your seven hours was wasted anyway. The pixels that you might have gained in loot or xp don't really get you anywhere and your ass is still getting fat in that computer chair of yours. Hell, when was the last time you went outside on a sunny saturday afternoon and played with your kids? or siblings? or significant other? Or just enjoyed the real world period beyond finding that stray M&amp;M in the couch cushins and squealing in delight?<br>
<br>
Just pixels guys. In a few years this game will be gone and all you will have are the memories. Discard the shiitty ones and hold onto the good ones.<br>

I don't CRY when I lose a mob becuase someone beat me to it.. I just keep on trucking.. <br>
<br>
So what you are really saying... is that your one group had SOLE right to ALL Rare spawns in the zone because you were there the longest?  Bah.. <br>
<br>
Last time I SERIOUSLY camped TT with a group I did so for EXP, and there were 2 other groups and a solo druid out there.. FORAGERS, HUNTERS&lt; and RARES where poping like MAD.. That night we killed LOTS of rares.. so if you can't stomache losing ONE because you didn't want to run across the zone to go get it.. don't cry to me and demand I give you the LOOT... You may entice me to stay and pull other stuff.  <br>
<br>
I'm usally a cool player, but nothing erks me more than greedy people claiming an entire zone... this is why I quit using QQ in the first.  TT was made for more than just 6 people.<br>

<br>
All I'm saying is to have more fun.. don't expect players to abide by your ideas of fairplay and what you claim is yours.  <br>
<br>
What you think is fairplay and camped, is not what other people think.  And what you Claim as YOURS, isn't what other people respect.. I respect action, ompetition, and skill.  I don't see how I should reward someone because I beat them.  If they beat me, I bow to them and respect them.... If I beat them, ... err.. I could say I expect the same respect, but... that would limit my fun if I did... If I beat them... then they have to deal with it.. and I go away thinking to myself.. I PLAYED WELL TODAY... !  Or I was LUCKY today.. <br>
<br>
I DON&quot;T go, complain, gripe, demand loot from the person that pulled, kited, killed and did all the work for something... <br>
<br>
The Secret of having FUN in this game is to have NO expectations that aren't CLEARLY enforceable by a GM on any other player... That is why I can get alnog with MOST ALL people.. Hell, I even Group with Asternak's Twink.. (LOL... no offense aster)...    <p>------------------------------

tu comprendes? you understand? WORK for the rare, dont steal it. if you wanna help kill PHS, fine, then competition is fun, NOT when you only go for named without doing your fair share of work.

I know there are two spawn cycle in SK.  I know what are the PH.  I clear the PH.  Does that mean I can claim all the named in SK?  Have you ever heard anyone claiming all the named in SK?   <br>
<br>
How about Rath Mount?  I know there are at least 2 cycles there.  Can I claim all the rares there?<br>

Where are all these new rules coming from?  This is so ...hmm...lame.  O well, this is what make high lvl ppl look bad/greedy.  Who put these new lame rules up and require everyone to follow?  Let me guess, some greedy farmers trying to farm in TT/FM but ppl keep getting 'HIS' spawns before he can because he's SLOW?<br>
<br>
You ppl need to stop making your own rules and requiring everyone to follow.  Listen:  You can ask ppl to follow your rules, but you can not FORCE anyone to follow it.  They are not doing anything wrong if they dont follow YOUR rules.   If you call someone names because they dont play by YOUR rules, guess who's wrong here?   No one have to play by YOUR rules.  This is not YOUR game. <br>
<br>
You dont have to tell us what respect is.  I respect a lot of ppl, but i dont respect every single person on earth.  Some ppl deserve your respect, some dont.  I dont respect someone doesnt mean I dont know what respect is.  If you think I should respect everyone, you are the one who should go back to school and learn about respect.  If a kid claiming he owns ALL the toys in kindergarden and doesnt let anyother kids touch them, should other kids respect him?<br>

There is 3 spawns. 2 foragers and 1 hunter in the zone. If I run by a named heck ya im taking it if i see it far below the top on my track.<br>
<br>
The reason is how do I know that this mob did not just killed by a rondom player on the way to seb. Should I ask the zone just so they can say yes even if they have not. Should I give the the zone the benifit of doubt when there are people in this gaime who train the urber mobs on other guilds just because the other guild beat them on the puchs? <br>
<br>
<br>
There is to many pricks in the high end game now a days to do this.<br>

Using my earlier statements. (Ej-To Seb, checking named spawns as I roam by) If I walk in a playground and see nobody is playing with my favorite ball, then I go pick it up, only to have another kid see I have the &quot;good ball&quot; and he's mad because he has ALL the balls but the good ball I have, since he was in the &quot;ball area&quot; first, then I should let him have it? Even tho when I found it, nobody was playing with it?<br>

yes i like that analogy too<br>
oh, and do 2 common mangy toys produce rare shiny pretty toys? uhhhh<br>
<br>
AND this si not personal to me cuz i am by FAR not slow, and have only missed one named to other competition in my whole TT pulling career...which is quite extensive. being the reason why i almost always have $ since i started pulling in TT. I even get tells asking me to go pull for groups, so this is definitely not personal, as someone sent me a hate tell about today <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  you know who you are jerk.<br>
<br>
but i do strongly believe in respect for others' time and effort put into pulling all the damn foragers or hunters just to get a few rares to spawn. THAT is what upsets me. seriously...make a ranger, get him to lvl 50+_. go to TT and try pulling continuously, not dying, for several hours straight. THEN dont get upset when someone just sitting there not helping pull/kill those PHs, gets up and steals your named.  FINALLY go thru all that without it leaving a lasting impression. oops cant can ya? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
just because the named roams dont mean its not camped. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And the word greedy is being tossed about here, but it could easily be used on either side of this example.  Both parties are looking out for themselves, so calling the other side greedy doesn't look very rational.<br>

<br>
1.  Someone mentioned this earlier, and they're right.  It's kinda pointless to ask the zone if someone is camping a wandering rare, because obviously someone is gonna say yes even if they just walked into the zone and haven't touched a thing.  There is no such thing as honesty anymore, its as dead as Latin.<br>
<br>
2.  Theres two problems with the apparent rules in TT (which I'm too low to have even been to).  First, people may not know the 'player-created' rules of the zone, if I walked in and saw a named spawn I never would've known before today that people had to sit and kill PHes to get it to pop.  The second problem with 'player-created' rules is just that, they're created by player and thusly not supported by guides.  So technically he had every right to kill any spawn that wasn't already aggro'd on another player and there isn't a damn thing that can be done about it.  I'm not saying he /should've/ kill it or that I don't support PCRs, but from the standpoint of Verant's rules, he was in the right.<br>
<br>
Like Trist I quit playing for about 6 months and just recently came back.  Unlike Trist, I came back to it with the additude of &quot;Be nice until its time to not be nice&quot; (Yeah it comes from a crappy Swayze movie, but its good advice).  I'll generally follow PCRs, but if you've done something to get on my @#%$ list, you can be sure I'm not going out of my way to extend you any courtesy, I'll do everything within the Verant rules to make you're life Hell. <p>Samedi Empyreal
