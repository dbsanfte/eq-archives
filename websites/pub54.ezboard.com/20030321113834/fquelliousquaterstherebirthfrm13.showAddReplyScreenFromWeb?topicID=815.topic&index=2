He wasn't complaining about wanting more money, he was upset because that woman was stating that NONE of the military needed a pay raise, you know, the pay raise we got every January?  She was saying we didn't need it and that we got more than we deserve.  <br>
<br>
Thats what he was writing this letter about.  He was showing that he could very well do the same job on the outside for A LOT more money but instead he chose to serve his country.  <br>
<br>
Instead of calling him some young punk, how about congratulating him on standing up for the US military?<br>
<br>
What it boils down to is, even if you don't like the government, support the soldiers.  <br>

<br>
the military dumps figures in the 100,000 dollar range on training him at their risk without knowing his capability.<br>
<br>
they offer him nearly 100% medical insurance even in rear D to him and his family without knowing his capability.<br>
<br>
they offer him a steady job by contract without knowing his capability.<br>
<br>
the point this man side stepped in his rant was that if ANY OF THEM could be making 70,000 dollars a year *prior* to the army/air force getting a hold of em then they would have took that job and not joined the military.  But they couldnt.  They joined cause it was the best option.  3 hots/cot, some training, a job, a way out of town, a way to grow up  its different for each person but the point remains the same it was their best option.  Their best option was NOT 70,000 dollars a year their best option was the military.  <br>
<br>
Now after the military gets a hold of ya and trains ya you might have some marketable skill but you didnt pay a dime for that transformation.  So for the first term you dont deserve anything resembling more pay.  as i said for the first term you need more grunt details, more training, more discipline.   your pay went to training ya.<br>
<br>
Why i called this rear-d punk a punk was my loyalty to combat arms.   You see he raised tones of patriotism.  The most patriotic people in the military are the relatively civilian skillwise skillless noncom's in combat arms.  who usually hang out because they can give these punks (and we were punks) off the street a fighting chance should they ever go to combat.   People stay in combat arms over 6 years when they could have long ago changed occupations not usually cause they love it but because they feel like they would be letting incoming soldiers down if they left.  Thats a patriot.  But that patriot has no &quot;skills&quot; and gets no respect.<br>
<br>
And what else bothered me bout this letter was that he complained bout going over seas to sit in a fox hole.  THAT WAS MY LIFE FOR 3 YEARS.   So here he is &quot;whine i got to get muddy&quot; when the rest of us stiffs in combat arms lived that 24/7.  My first year in the army i literally spent more time in the field then i did in the rear barracks.  No pointed my skills out in objection.  Forgive me i wont cry cause he has to go man a fox hole. <br>
<br>
 And let me tell you combat arms is always stressfuls.  its like having a boss that gets to push you as FAR as you can go every day.  I got deployed to kuwait once it was actually less stressful then a normal field excercise.   In kuwait people stopped trying to push you and started just trying to pace you.  Instead of getting 4 hours sleep i was getting 7 easy.  <br>
<br>
 And also the army changes alot for soldiers in deployment.   In the rear its very political.  deployed the character of the army changes alot.   It moves to an organization driven by performance instead of rule book standards.   lightening the stress on soldiers by loads as most of em are trained to a fairly high performance standard.  <br>
<br>
As for family and cash?  Deployed soldiers get combat pay + they dont spend any pay.   Families arnt strapped for cash.  families still get to live in the government provided homes.  (ANOTHER BENEFIT!) The check still hits the bank.  There are numerous base faciliaties to help out.  There is a rear D wives structure. (very political but there none the less)  there are councilors to help figure the whole mess out.  if your taxes need done and your wife doesnt know how the army provides people that will do the taxes.  The yard work is done by rear D soldiers.   <br>
<br>
In short.  Give more money to the reenlisted combat arms noncoms  the true patriots. screw everyone else.  TY.<br>

The point here ain't about what branch you served in, or in what capacity, it's about the embarrasing fact that most young military families have to apply for food stamps and such just to make ends meet. You talk about there being no burden when the soldier gets deployed, but a heckuva lot of em work two jobs just to keep their kids in clothes.<br>
<br>
This AFIT joker ain't griping about how tough his job is, he's griping about how little money he makes in comparison to Cindy Williams outrageous claims about how overcompensated the military is.<br>
<br>
My dad was in Combat Arms and Combat Support in the USArmy for 24 years, and I know how little money he made and how little we scraped by on. My Dad my 4 times his Army salary after retirement, and his skillset was nowhere near as useful as an IT wonks' is. <br>
<br>
Sure, this low-rank enlisted man doesn't deserve $80k a year, but I don't see him asking for it. I see him wanting to hold his head up and not have to beg the State for food stamps for another month.<br>

<br>
married military pay is higher then base pay.  they pay you more for having a family.  its a tradition of the army.<br>
<br>
single soldier pay is correct.  there isnt a soldier alive that shouldnt be able to live on 10k take home when everything else is payed for.  but if family pay is wrong then its wrong. i was never married.<br>
<br>
if the point is this isnt a living wage then i can agree.<br>
<br>
if the point is i could make more then i got issues outlined above.<br>

Being married didn't effect your base pay whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Serioulsy man, it is emabarassaing to hear you talk this way if you really are/were a service member,  To say that your comrades in arms don't deserve a raise to keep up with the cost of living is sad.  As it is, raises were always a joke, 10% looks good on paper, but when your base salary is 10k, its not that big of  a deal.  Hell I never even remember getting a 10% raises, was more like 4 or 5%.<br>
<br>
I was a E5 in the Navy when I got out to go to college and my Base salary was maybe 18k, and now with graduation coming up in May, I'm prolly gonna join back up as an Ensign, and then my base salary will prolly bump up to 28k.  My degree is Nursing, and currently I can make 50K starting anywhere in my state with this degree...are you saying that once I join, I'm going to be paid too much?<br>
<br>
People don't join the service to make a buck, they join to serve their contry, whether they are a grunt or an admin desk jockey....  Because of them there is no draft and everyone else can rest assured THEY don't have to if they don't want to.  These people should be respected for their sarcifices, not punished.<br>

<br>
As far as the college thing goes, I could have went to college to become an electronic tech, instead I chose to serve my country which I did for six years.  I took the ASVAB and scored the best in electronics so they pushed me that way.  I became a 68X Armament Electrical repairer on the AH 64 Apache.  That means I fixed the electronic systems and also loaded the aircraft.  <br>
<br>
I don't understand why you are bringing up combat arms in this thing because quite frankly I was deployed three times and while the infantry sat back in camp and got those 7 hours of sleep, I was running missions and doing jump FARPS.  While the infantry sat in the chow hall complaining about how good we had it, I was getting wind blown out on a launch pad by a helicopter.  Also once a war was to kick off, my job would be to ride on a black hawk with ammo behind enemy lines, set up a FARP, and hope to god the enemy didn't find us while we loaded aircraft and refueled them.  Know what, I wasn't considered combat arms.  Please stop with the dividing up how hard each section of things are until you know more about what each section does. <br>
<br>
What this &quot;punk&quot; is doing is standing up for soldiers.  He is tired of seeing crap attitudes come from people who think we get too much and deserve less than what we get.  I mean come on, its the soldier that insures we have the freedom that we do, at least the government could do is raise thier pay to just above welfare status. <br>

<br>
A married E-5/E-6's BAH is around 25-45 more than a single E-5's/E-6's BAH.  (Depending on where you're stationed).  I'm sorry, but my kids go through a lot more than 25-45 dollars in diapers a month (if yer about to have a kid, screw Huggies/Luvs, go with Dri-Bottoms.  Cheaper, and imo, better quality.)<br>

Qut's- I started out in combat arms (12B).  I re-classed to my current MOS, Apache Armament/Electrical specialist after 6 years.  Like you, I had the same attitude about &quot;rear-d pogues, etc, etc, etc.&quot;  That just shows how narrow minded I, and YOU really are.  Ask the boys of the 504th and 505th PIR how happy they are to see an Apache fly overhead, providing close air support.  Ask those same folks how happy they are to get they're &quot;3 hots and a cot&quot; delivered to them by other folks riding on a blackhawk or chinook, 'cause driving a convoy is too unsafe to get the job done.  These days, it's a team effort to get anything done.  As for all the training I've received.....  for an aviation MOS, it's a 6 YEAR initial enlistment, to ensure the government gets their monies worth out of you.  By the way... I work hard now in garrison than I ever did.  The almighty OR rate (operational readiness) is king. <br>
<br>
My main point, and the issue I was trying to bring to light was, the 1st term enlisted guy, newly married (i.e, within the past 2 years or so), with/without a kid.  Many of these folks are a single income family (wether because the spouse is struggling to keep a semblance of normal family life together while trying to get through school/ a training program of some sort, or raising a child) that are forced to apply for WIC, food stamps, and any sort of local grant they can get to make ends meet.  Please, take the blinders off, and take a good look at the issue I presented.  I agree, combat arms non-coms are true patriots (and they do receive other compensation; re-enlistment bonuses are typically much higher, and in garrison, workloads are light enough for the motivated ones to complete much work on college degrees), but does that mean the rest of us aren't?<br>

<br>
What the &quot;punk&quot; is doing is taking is opportunity for granted and/or trying to downplay that he got something he wanted.<br>
<br>
The myth being perpetrated here is that the soul reason soldiers enlist is out of patriotism and duty.   90% or more can point to something they wanted.  education benefits/ a secure job/a way out of town/ security for their family/ a way to grow up/pay off their secure loan.  They got that. what ever it was they were looking for they got.  for me it was a way out of town.  they got whatever they were looking for and alot more.  it was the deal; the deal was fulfilled.   practically speaking very few enlisted people joined cause they wanted to serve without there being another reason.<br>
<br>
single soldier first term enlisted make enough money.  they have disposable income of 25 bucks a day.  no rent. no bills. no medical. no food expenses.  if you just chill out during the week spend 5 bucks on whatever by the end of the week you blow 150 bucks every weekend.  this is the bottom rung soldier.  Single that has avoided serious bills.    this is a soldier excepted without question bout ability bout drive bout anything.  sign lets go. <br>
<br>
its enough.  what might not be enough is reenlisted pays which primairly are career e4s and e5s+ and housing pay where applicable.<br>
  <br>
<br>
<br>
as for the combat arms thing.   there is nothing specially grueling bout these deployments specially these 3 to 6 month missions.  if they  werent doing that they would be in the field doing the same stuff only with less sleep.   75% of the time our rear support further up then our battalion aid wouldnt go with us only a few major field excercises that rolled out brigade/division assets.   <br>
<br>
as for the difference live bullets being shot at you makes.  Theres no pay for compensating live bullets.  theres no number.<br>

theres prolly room for a raise.  i wish i could erase the &quot;punk&quot; thing but thats just me i talk like foo'l sometimes. <br>
<br>
 lol we were punks though.  there was so much fist fighting in the 3 years i was in it was truely disturbing in review.  people fighting people just cause their unit was wrong (true story on multiple occasions).   its an odd culture when you bring so many different kinds of people together and train them to have intense pride bout themselves.   <br>

I just feel bad for some of these kids coming in these days.  It's kinda tough to hurt my feelings.<br>
<br>
I do agree with you on the NCO issue.  An NCO is part-time counselor, baby-sitter, and more.  The maturity level of the recruits we get these days is nowhere near where it was.  Many are arriving at their first duty station with a pile of debt.  Some of them have no clue how to balance a check book.  Initial Entry Training (the new, &quot;politically correct&quot; name for basic training) has been hamstrung.  While some of the changes are for the better, many of the changes are perceived to be &quot;coddling&quot; the newest member of the service.  We get recruits straight from training now, that have never passed a PT test.  It's no longer a requirement.  That's right, to get out of Basic/AIT, the only requirement is to stay out of trouble.  You only need 50 points per event on the PT test (as opposed to 60), and we've even gotten a few that hadn't qualified on their rifle.  What's that mean?  It means we have to not only handle all the normal duties and details of the day, but also try and educate these kids on a multitude of subjects.  The average soldier we get straight from training is simply not equipped to care for himself and/or his family.  The frugality of previous generations simply isn't there in many of these kids.  Once you get them straightened out, and educate them on personal/family finance, a sense of pride, and mission accomplishment, many of them are great soldiers, and a true asset.  It's those soldiers I'd love to help!  <br>
<br>
Anyhow, how'd that rant get started....  *shrug*<br>
<br>
Oh,... my wife's in too, so we're doin' pretty good on finances at the moment.  But when we first got married (E-4 &amp; E-3), and had our first child, it was a struggle for us.  Even with both paychecks, it was a stretch.  We definately needed advice on finances.  Fortunately, we had a great platoon sergeant, and caring family members that got us straightened out.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://216.40.249.192/mysmilies/contrib/guus/tong.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

I agree we military need more pay.  As a soon to be promoted LTC (&quot;ding O5&quot;) married to another LTC, we are not hurting at all.  However, we combined make as much as I would make as a civilian lawyer with my class standing and experiance.  Then again, if you joined the military for the money you are dumb, if you stay in for the money you are stupid.  There are far more reasons to stay or join than money. <br>

I know as an E2 at Ft. Campbell, I was loaded.  But as a married Specialist in &quot;Backwoods&quot;(=low cost of living) of Pennsylvania, it was a struggle with the wife working and no kids.  But I don't see the issue as being merely a monitary one.  The fact is whether we joined to get out of town, to aviod college, to get training, or couldn't find a job in the &quot;real world&quot;, we joined and in the end, could die defending THIS country and some stupid lady (term used loosely) that probably made more in the 1950's than you or I will see in a lifetime.  Now she has the nerve to say that people are overpaid for risking thier lives.  I was not combat arms so a bullet was the least of my worries but sitting in a shelter with a big green bullseye outside makes a nice target for a scud, missile, or pilot in the area.  <br>
<br>
This guy may be a punk, but he atleast he had the brass to give his opinion, followed by facts that anyone can understand supporting his opinion.  Some dipshit that hasn't served (family members serve too) won't understand BAQ and Seperate Rations but the college guy will understand that he does a similar job to him and gets 80k a year and this guy gets 18k.  <br>

(I never read &quot;punk&quot; as being a bad thing BTW)<br>
<br>
When I first entered the service, it was NOT for money (I left a well paying job), it was NOT for a &quot;get out of town free card&quot; (I came back when I was done), it was NOT for training (not even close to what I do now).<br>
<br>
I entered the service to serve my country.  I have a family history in the armed services, my dad (16 years), his dad (8 years), his dad (10 years)... and it was my turn.  It was NOT forced on me.  It was my choice to enter (although I was limited on what I was allowed to choose, for fear of a good beating).<br>
<br>
I agree that 90% of todays newly enlisted join the service for reasons OTHER THAN to just serve OUR coutry, but please be mindful of those of us who don't.<br>
<br>
Since my first station in Germany, I had a second job at the enlisted club.  And I kept that job for 3 years and 4 months to help pay the bills of a growing family (read- wife and child).  While you GET money for living off-base (in APPROVED housing), you don't always get enough to pay the rent (read-some comes out of your own pocket).  You also needed to purchase a car, gas and insurance (more from your own pocket), the base exchange did not always have in-stock the supplies you needed (read-diapers or whatever), and hell... god forbid if you smoked (read-paid more for them on-base then off).  <br>
<br>
But yes, I survived (although some may not like it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .. ), I lived to walk, talk, drink, work, love and play with my family and friends.  <br>
<br>
The ONLY larger oxymoron than &quot;military intelligence&quot;... is &quot;adaquate military pay&quot;<br>
<br>
Not a flame... just a few more facts. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804">Venerable Impudent Blasphemy</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I agree the lower end military should get more pay</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, but I see Q's point.  The military almost certainly gave that guy all the training he needed to work on CISCO stuff.  I am in the private sector and i can say that a trained CISCO person makes about 50,000 a year before taxes if you work for a reseller or installing firm.  if you are one of the lucky to land a gig at a private office and you are the admin AND you have CISCO knowledge, THEN you make the 80K range.  So, anyway, thats not the point.  I guess the point is the guy got a bunch of training worth thousands of dollars (not to mention the other military benefits)  with a low salary.  Once he decided to move on, he'll be worth a lot more per annium. all thanks to the military and some hard work on his part  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://216.40.249.192/mysmilies/contrib/guus/tong.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I just want to REPEAT that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I agree the lower end military should get more pay</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->!

I had free housing (dorm like rooms), free food, free medical.  As a single person, the salary that they get today is probably sufficent.<br>
<br>
Being married, is another story unless your an officer.  For this reason alone, the base pays should be raised.  And I dont think i have seen it mentioned yet, but the military is getting the highest pay raises in government for the past two years or so.  A fraction of the responsibility also lies with the enlisted person not to have more kids than they can afford too.  Things happen though and that is a fact of life.  But when you go into the military, you know what your going to get.<br>

Every time he would go out in the field, they would cut his housing allowance... they were feeding him in the field, so he didn't need to be paid for it, right? And if the military wanted their soldiers to have a spouse, the military would have issued a spouse. I remember some months while he was out where all I would have were a box of bisquick, some sugar and eggs, cheese slices and milk I was given from a friend who received it from WIC because my job and his paycheck were not enough.<br>
Standing ovation to the punk!!<br>
