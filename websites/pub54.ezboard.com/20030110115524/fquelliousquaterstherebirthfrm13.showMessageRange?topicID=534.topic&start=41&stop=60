<br>
Cazel is a very Iffy spawn...some times hes up ALL the time, and others, he doesnt show his ugly self for a week.  I've camped him for my chanter in the past and I've helped other chanters do it as well.  To say that &quot;it's only Cazel&quot; or &quot;it's just a droppable spoon&quot; is just ignorant.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what bad blood your two guilds have, this type of action is unacceptable, especially after reading a Radiant flame a lil while back where Radiant Folks bitched out ADD folks for stealing the shissar wraith in PoF after a radiant member had already engaged it.  Yeah harder mob and rarer, but same basic principle.  Seems to me this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black.<br>

&quot;Tristadorn saw a situation where the mob that was 'somewhat' engaged really wasn't going to die anytime soon [snip]&quot;<br>
-- Zodiack<br>
<br>
That's like being &quot;somewhat&quot; pregnant. There is no somewhat about it. The mob is either engaged or it is not engaged. PNP doesn't make allowances for players to determine when it's &quot;okay&quot; to KS a mob. Someone actually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  saw</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> this mob engaged and felt that, due to the bad mojo between his guild and this guild, he had a right to give their enchanter the shaft. (Thx generalizations by association. Touch of irony: at the same time you reserve the right to flame/correct anyone who comes close to making a generalization about your guild and/or its members.)<br>
<br>
As for your criminal analogy, you leave out a key point: you're not the judge, jury, or executioner (i.e., GM). You're a victim to what you felt was intentional training. It was your duty to /petition it. You're not anything special that gets to met out justice as you see fit, lest every blue server be a haven to deranged vigilantes. No matter what angle you approach it from and how you present it, two wrongs don't make a right.

I was in Oasis with my druid and a monk friend tracking for Cazel.  I was there a good part of the evening.  <br>
<br>
I struggle with this issue for a couple different reasons.  Initially, I felt kinda bad for the chanter, because I know how I felt when it happened to me (and it has).  Fact is, I had been camping him all evening as well.  Someone was getting a spoon, it boiled down to me.  Amaya's guild did not come to help her.<br>
<br>
1.) I've been camping a spawn (Vessel Drozlin) and had someone else take the kill from me because I didn't have sufficient force in the zone before they did, and thereby lost the kill.  I had to stand there and watch him go down while my group was close.  It's the nature of the race game.   <br>
<br>
2.) The engagement rule .. hmm, I know this is a common practice to engage and kite a mob until you can get sufficient force in zone to kill it.  Personally, I don't engage a mob I can't kill.   I know others do, but I personally don't think its' the right thing to do.  Here's who was online in Unruled Power and their location when this all happened.  It is clear to me that Amaya could not have EVER solo'd Cazel.  It is also clear to me that her guildmates were not mobilizing to assist her.   <br>
<br>
--(60 Assassin) Macvalor (Half Elf): Zone: Maiden<br>
--(60 Virtuoso) Ulwern (Wood Elf): Zone: Burning Wood<br>
--(60 Oracle) Shmeep (Barbarian): Zone: Nexus<br>
--(55 Myrmidon) Korgathe (Iksar): Zone: Oasis<br>
--(Anonymous) Rubiee <br>
--(57 Luminary) Proman (Ogre): Zone: Chardok<br>
--(57 Revenant) Zexu (Dark Elf): Zone: Dreadlands<br>
--(Anonymous) Amaya (was in Oasis fearing Cazel)<br>
--(52 Heretic) Makraiza (Iksar): Zone: Najena <br>
<br>
3.) Had the situation been reversed... I wouldn't have engaged what I couldn't kill.  I'd have called upon my guild for help and kept sight of the target until I could engage it.   Which is what I did in this instance as well.  Had I engaged the giant that I couldn't kill, would UP have killed it?  I sure think so.  <br>
<br>
Amaya and I reached Cazel at about the same time.  He was close to me when he popped.   It is my belief she engaged it when she saw me.  He was not snared at any time, so when she feared it, it took off like a shot and the paladin (non-guildy whom she /ooc'd to come help her)  couldn't keep up with it to do damage.  He was low level paladin as well.  I watched this go on for quite some time, never seeing Cazel go below 99% life.   When Radiant arrived, she was given time to seriously engage.  I'm sorry, but I don't believe anyone would let me kite him around for an hour while they tried to get enough people in zone to kill him.   20 minutes is plenty of time to mobilize a group of people.  Try kiting Lodi around for 20 minutes and see where it gets you.  <br>
<br>
As far as Hate goes, yes they were deliberately training the hell out of Radiant.   But I didn't think Hate was the purpose of this rant.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, I stand by and support the members of my guild.   Flame them.  Flame me.  I know where my friends are at the end of the day.  <br>

How in the hell would getting Shissar stolen from us in Fear give us a bad track record Erana?  <br>
<br>
As for Hate.  If you referring to Friday night, it was Radiant that was trained by UP.  UP can deny it all they want, but running into safe camp from port up, after I had already made the run aggro free, does not bring you mobs from the second floor of the Cleric House even if you do aggro some mobs on the way to camp.  We may have aggro'd a few on the way to camp, but there is absolutely no way that Drake would have ended up in our camp unless UP went and got it. <br>
<br>
I was not on last night, so I will not comment on the Cazel incident, but Kiting a mob around the zone waiting on sufficient force does not constitute engagement.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ulordvaghrisbloodreaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Vaghris Bloodreaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knife of R'holaer</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/22/02 10:09:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=534.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good ole Radiant? eh?</span><hr size=1> Erana...what in the blue fuck are you talking about? No, personally i dont know anything about a &quot;ragefire&quot; incident. I DO know, in fact, of the Fear one you speak of. And I'm still trying to figure out how the bloody hell that gives US a bad track record. Let me break it down for you, incase you missed the...oh...18 page flame about it, in which you must have missed the whole damn thing. WoS was pulled by Bippity, and was going to continue reeling it into a sufficient force of people with, again, the immediate intent of killing WoS for the enchanter epic. Verbo ran up and did his damnest to steal agro back from Bip and ran it as well as a quite a few roamers into the ADD camp. Now, where in all that, did Radiant become the badguy to receive your &quot;bad track record&quot;? There's log of it, which Bippity posted to show that we had it engaged first and was otw back to the group in order to kill it. We had this ks'd --from us-- though we had a) sufficient force (which in the end, thats what it comes down to) and b) intent to kill WoS. <br>
<br>
Yes, i know this is really digging into the buried past, but it seems that a blight of ignorance has spawned from Ulwern and infected Erana in the process. What goddamn right do you have to say Radiant has a bad track record eh? Fear was a tad different then Cazel, Erana. We got screwed hard though we, in fact, had force enough to lay claim to him. If Amaya had sufficient force (hot damn, its like im trying to impress something upon you), obviously Radiant would have backed off, seeing as it was, engaged with the immediate intent to kill. ~cough~ Read below, though i know Ravenark isnt defending anyone or taking sides, he states it rather clearly.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;Technically, engaging is not kiting around a mob waiting for others to show up. Engaging is pulling Cazel with the immediate intent to kill him. In other words, you pull cazel to a party to kill him then and now.

<br>
now, seeing there wasnt sufficient force (theres that word again, maybe its stuck in your head by now) on behalf of UP to take Cazel, and having waited for forces to arrive on our side which was 20 or so minutes after the initial telling that Cazel was up, decided to take him, because people were getting impatient. No rules were broken in doing this, though some might say morals come into play. To some, yes, to other, no, its a pure case by case basis. I'm sure Verbo felt he had every right to take WoS and nail his head above the collective fireplace of ADD, if morals are that matter.  <p><br>

Erana: Radiant camped Rage twice pre-list. The only issue there was that a cleric who hadn't been online for more than a handful of hours a day (and hadn't been there as long as our clerics) tried to claim the camp. He never had a group of guildies in the zone, except when Rage was due to spawn. Radiant, however, maintained at least a 1-group presence at all times. The cleric has since quit the game, but the guild he was in? ADD. <br>
<br>
Hell, on the first camp, said cleric forced a GM-sponsored roll between the two campers. Our cleric rolled a 36. He rolled a 30. And still hung around until Rage popped, and was upset that he didn't get it.<br>
<br>
That's a stupid and entirely uninformed thing to bring up. There was certainly no issue, save what one person with no legitimate claim on the camp chose to make.<br>
<br>
And as for the incidents in fear... wha? Care to explain?<br>

Ah. Right. So hearsay + supposition + ignorance (of past situations) = a bad track record? You're the kind of friend I can live without. <br>

<br>
In Hate : Yes we were trained. There is no way you are going to get 15+ mobs back to your camp with a monk pulling unless you want them there. No it wasn't our agro from running the walls, we didn't have any mobs following us they showed up well after we go into camp.<br>
<br>
Cazel : Not sure what I am supposed to feel bad about... Killing a mob that someone else couldn't? I do feel bad that the enchantress doesn't have a guild that will help her like ours. I am sorry she didn't have the people to help her but that is her choice in who she is friends with.<br>
<br>
Arrogance.. Yup or confidence. Didn't know it was arrogant to say you won't engage a mob you can't kill. Sounds like common sense to me. Sure sometimes you push the envelope but I dont go in to ME and pull a mob solo b/c I can't kill it. just like an enchanter with a guild that won't help shouldn't pull Cazel.<br>
<br>
If Radiant has such a bad reputation why do so many people want to join. Strange that... Old School people may not want to join b/c they think they are so high above everone else to join such a &quot;lowibe&quot; guild but where have all those guilds gone? LC is doing VT, who else? Playing EQ a long time doesn't make you smarter.. just makes your characters older.<br>
<br>
Eh... Whiners. Humm... I didn't see Radiant post first about &quot;oooo you trained our hate raid WAAAAHH&quot; No I saw UP post about &quot;WaaaaaH! You KS'd a mob our single ench with her lvl 40 pally friend couldn't kill!&quot; Yup.. Whine on you Crazy Diamond..  <p>Madoc <br>

Radiant is a medium sized guild yet they managed to take down a mob like Vindi (yes I know it is easy for some guilds but was Radiant's first try). <br>
<br>

however wasnt it stated earlier that you could not kill him previously so had to get a strat? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=167569">Lormif 58 Beastlord</a><br>

<br>
I'm sorry. Where in Verant's rules does it say you need x amount of people with such-and-such a group configuration and you have x amount of time to kill a mob? I find it hilarious that some are trying to prove themselves reasonable when the grudge they hold for UP on a whole has been paraded with admirable flames on this thread from the getgo. But nah, that couldn't possibly impair judgment! Somehow I'm not supposed to link cause and effect. And finally, there are always &quot;special clauses&quot; people reserve for themselves to make allowances for being, in a word, dicks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't know it was arrogant to say you won't engage a mob you can't kill.&quot;<br>
<br>
Arrogance is not setting limits/standards for yourself. Arrogance is deciding your limits/standards are better than someone else's and therefore your standards should be enforced against their will.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eh... Whiners. Humm... I didn't see Radiant post first about &quot;oooo you trained our hate raid WAAAAHH&quot; No I saw UP post about &quot;WaaaaaH! You KS'd a mob our single ench with her lvl 40 pally friend couldn't kill!&quot; Yup.. Whine on you Crazy Diamond..&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know how long you've been with Radiant, but there have been one or two threads here. Long at that, one of them started by Trist.<br>
<br>
It was a sarcastic remark at Raehn's arrogant statements. If one group of people get to decide a chanter/paly is insufficient force to bring down Cazel and their guildmates won't show up before the two die by whatever mystical powers they are endowed with, I can get to decide whenever a group of people will not successfully kill Lodi after an allotted time set by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> me</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, so I shouldn’t have to get scathed here. After all, I’m prescient, right?<br>
