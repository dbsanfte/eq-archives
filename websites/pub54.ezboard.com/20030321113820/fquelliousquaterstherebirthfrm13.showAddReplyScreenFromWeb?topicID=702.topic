Let me make this very clear, I dont even know Slepnir, Ive talked to him a few times and had a few deep conversations but thats the extent of it, i'm not friends with him, he's not in my guild, he's not my friend irl, the only basis on which i know him is because he was interested in recruiting with Wraith, he wasnt even a official recruit.<br>
I dont know the whole story, however i know this much.. Slepnir left rel in por because he felt that they were stagnant, for you shitforbains out there that means standing still, going no where, taking up space, being gay, whatever. He wanted to progress in the end game and not farm old content. He was tired of being relied on as a main tank or being in every single MT order.<br>
That is exactly what Slepnir told me. Which I totally understood and agreed with.<br>
I guess as soon as word got around that Slepnir had left Rel in Por, I (the recruitment officer of wraith) started getting bombarded by tells from random rel in por members telling me how much Slepnir sucks, how bad he would fuck me and my guild, and how much scum he was. When i asked for a reason, all i could pick apart from the random biased bullshit that i got was 150 diffrent reasons why i should deny him the right to recruit with Wraith. Random people were mad because he came to the decision to leave Rel in Por with gear &quot;They&quot; equipped his toon with, gear that he obviously earned. Absolutly no constructive concrete reasons why Slepnir was a bad guy at all. I even made a few attempts to get deeper beef on Slepnir, I, nor Wraith, nor any other guild want to recruit useless peices of shit that will just detag in a week. Thanks and respect to Leeche for giving me a few facts instead of a few paragraphs of heresay and/or bullshit.<br>
As for whoever raped Slepnir's character, obviously as a dickless attack of revenge, obviously a member of Rel in Por, your a peice of shit. <br>
As for the leader of Rel in Por, (Who BTW said Slepnir deserved every bit of what he got)  who is probably selling Slepnirs gear off in the bazaar as we speak, fucking himself in the ass with Slepnirs Blade of carnage, and preaching horse shit and lies to his followers to cover his ass, your a peice of shit my friend.<br>
<br>
To my knowledge, i dont think Slepnir raped anyones sister, shot anyones relative or called in a bomb threat on someone house. No one deserves to have thier character jacked, in this case jacked by someone who the man trusted with his account information, However, I dont feel sorry for anyone who gives out thier account info and gets fucked over. I just wanted to point out a few of the many cock suckers that inhabit our fantasy game world. I pity the fool that takes orders from a person who sucks such a enormous amount of dick.<br>
Thanks<br>

You guys can blame Seph all you want, but i'll tell  you this, Slepnir is not only deceptive, but intelligent, congrats you have just been had by another 15 (maybe hes 16) year old gamer. While he may not fit the hacker part, Slep fits in perfect with the con-artists and low life b!tches part of your post. I've watched the f*cker train our Guild not once but twice (2 seperate occassions) and play it off as someone elses fault, i've also seen him come to a raid when the MOB was dead and act as if he was there so he could win loot (which he did.) <br>
<br>
While Slep licks a nice ring around your asshole much in the same way he did Sephrok, I think you need to talk to Seph about this. You don't see Slep making a big deal about this anymore, why? Because the fucker did one last ditch effort to pull some shit before he quit and hes almost getting away with it. <br>
<br>
I look at Slep and I look at Seph and I know immediately who is in the wrong just from past experiences that i've witnessed. <br>
<br>
Oh and for those slow ones that haven't got it yet: SLEPNIR FUCKED WITH HIS OWN ACCOUNT, the bitch was quiting the game and decided to stab a few backs of people he had falling outs with. I hope your @ss feels good, cause from the sounds of it Slepnir has a new b!tch doing his dirty work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

PROVE me wrong.... I'm not trying to burn a bridge here, nor do I care, but I know I am right. <br>

PS: What stuff of Slep's is Seph selling in Bazaar, i'd also like to get a laugh out of this one.<br>

Why dont you enlighten us, since you seem to know everything that happened With slepnir.<br>
Enlighten us on why he may have deleved himself and ?destroyed his own equiptment.<br>
<br>

Seems like your alot more pissed off then you would be if he had trained your guild a couple months ago or something, and won a peice of loot that you probably didnt have the points for or whatever.<br>
Explain why Slepnir, if he was really quitting eq, would even try to recruit with wraith. Explain why he didnt just sell his gear on PA, or his character even. Details pls. <br>
<br>
&quot;&quot;the bitch was quiting the game and decided to stab a few backs of people he had falling outs with&quot;&quot;<br>
He stabbed people in the back by fucking with his own account?<br>
If this little bit of so called true information is known by rel in por, why did Sephrok say that Slepnir deserved what happened to him? Why would he say that, instead of just saying the stupid fucker fucked his own account dont ask my dumb ass why???<br>

Why you ask? Well sure our server has competition between Guilds, but let me say Slepnir was an advocate against Wraith, he spit enough shit about your tactics, numbers, etc that I really never ever saw him recruiting with you. <br>
<br>
Now say my 'theory'(i'll call it that for benefit of the doubt) is true, it makes sense. Slep joins Wraith as a slap in the face to Seph and get a few quick pieces of VT and Emp loot, Slep sees its not all its cracked up to be and decided to leave the game(a second option he mentioned in his 'leaving the Guild' post,) well why not get one last shot in on Seph huh?<br>
<br>
Re-reading what I just said I don't think I could have said it any better, thats exactly what I could see Slep doing. Since your quick to say you don't know Slep, and haven't had a asshole licking like so many others from him, then where exactly are your facts coming from? <br>
<br>
If Seph was selling stolen Slep loot, GMs would have been all over it, both accounts would have been suspended until everything was investigated. On top of that, I don't recall ANYONE having Slep's account info, in fact I think he said it himself that he never gives it out to anyone. <br>
<br>
All I can say is believe what you want, but your being had by a kid's lie, enjoy yourself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Did we ask Slepnir to give back a BoC when he left? Yep.<br>
Why not? It's the only one in our guild.<br>
<br>
Then Slep was (I guess) rejected from Wraith. So he tries to start crap up by deleveling himself and saying it wasn't him that did it. He canceled his account too, according to friends of his in RIP anyway.<br>
<br>

<br>
Right....  We had some internal guild issues and didnt raid for like 4 days out of a week i'd hardly call that stagnant that includes a few shots at HP.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> He was tired of being relied on as a main tank or being in every single MT order. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
because we were lacking in tanks recently so he needed to do his part to make the guild better.. He was an officer.. thats a title that comes with special meaning.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Absolutly no constructive concrete reasons why Slepnir was a bad guy at all. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hey I liked Slepnir until what he did..  He left all of a sudden with OUR BoC.. he didnt have that long.. coincedence?  anyway.. again he was an officer you don't just leave when you are an officer.  thats enough evidence to show that he dumped his friends and his status just so he can raid higher places that we haven't been able to see yet but will soon.  That he is selfish.  Which is enough to deny someone membership in my mind.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> who is probably selling Slepnirs gear off in the bazaar as we speak, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
How dare you say that..  Its nice to think you trust slepnir over a guildleader. someone who leads a respected guild for over a year to some warrior who jumps guilds a lot.<br>
<br>
There is no evidence to support or deny that Slepnir raped his own account or that Sephrok or someone else in the guild did that. <br>
<br>
I will say that Sephrok did not do it in my personal opinion.  Could someone else have? maybe but not like slepnir gave his pw out to everyone.. Infact probably no one besides officers and the sort.  <br>
<br>
its also possible that he raped his own account to frame Sephrok because his application to wraith was denied so he wanted to drag the guild name through the mud.. Which has seemed to worked.  <br>
<br>
There is no evidence to support either way.. so this should just be dropped.. slepnir is gone just deal with it.. He goes down as scum in my book. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

everyone is saying he PROBABLY did this...or he PROBABLY did that...<br>
there is no proof anywhere of anything...except that slepnir got hacked and that was wrong...<br>
i was slepnir's friend and i started this from a biased stand point aswell...<br>
i still lean towards slepnir's side and understand why he left...<br>
i understand why people are mad at him for leaving...<br>
but there is no reason in the world except for the few tenalin stated that gives anyone the right to ruin someone's char because we have all put way too much of our time and our lives into this game...<br>

i have other things to say but it should be kept in guild...<br>

Slepnir was an officer in RIP, spent all his raid points on our first and only BoC, then ran to join 'greener pastures' if you can count Wraith as that. (No offense to Wraith, but i dont, both guilds have their positives and negatives).<br>
<br>
He did the same when he was in ADD. Joined in full crafted, got full Skyshrine armor and a few other things then left for RIP. He was the one that started the crumbling of ADD. Fortunately, it wont happen with RIP cus we dont rely on him.<br>
<br>
Sephrok was very pissed off that he left. He had practically PLed him to 65 (as he was out main tank) and helped him get most of his gear and AA's. Slepnir returned the favour by leaving. Sephrok (although there is no proof either way) imo would never do this to Slepnir. His 'getback' at Slepnir was to tell every recruitment officer of LC/VM/Wraith what Slepnir did to us.<br>
<br>
Desaran, you're a really nice guy in game, and u send me tells when u have queres about my guild. You should have fucking done it this time too. <br>
<br>
Some people actually believe Slepnir did this to himself as a kind of Kamikazi on RIP before he quit as he had been badmouthed to all the big guilds. All of them are rumours, no one knows who did it.<br>
<br>
Des, if u want me to put up all the BULLSHIT i hear about you then keep spreading the rumours about us.<br>

erm... If he spent ALL of his &quot;raid points&quot; AND actually got the BoC... then did he NOT deserve it?<br>
<br>
I dont care about guild issues or politics.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>If he spent his points on a piece of gear, did he deserve it?  If you answer no, then why the fuck give it to him?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Everyone knows I am against the political bullshit that gets presented to the rest of the server from a couple of the top guilds, this is a perfect example of why.<br>
<br>
I only know these peeps by reputation (good or bad).  But I tell ya, if he spent his points (AND YOU GAVE IT TO HIM), then he must have deserved the BoC. It was his at that point.  To do with what he saw fit.<br>
<br>
Now, we can address the guild issue part.  Was he wrong for leaving RiP the way he did? maybe.  Was he wrong for taking (or attempting to) the BoC with him? No (he EARNED it).<br>
<br>
Just get yer shit together, and go get another.  If you got one, you can get another.  Or is that your problem?  Now that he left, you dont feel like you have the quality of tanks that can handle the fights needed? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804">Impudent Blasphemy</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

This ENTIRE game revolves around spawn times and %'s.  <br>
<br>
I never claimed to know everything, nor would I.  NO ONE CAN.<br>
<br>
Now, AoW has a loot table with about 6 items on it.  Of which, he will almost always drop 3 items.  You figure out the damn odds.  (and yes, 2 blades have dropped from a single AoW kill[on a different server]).<br>
<br>
Again, I'll ask the question.. If he spent HIS points, and you GAVE it to HIM.... why give it to him if he did not deserve it?<br>
<br>

Once spent, the item becomes the property of the member who purchased the item with his/her RAID points.  <br>
<br>
Of course, I'm not a member of a guild that works off a point system, but that is my understanding on how a point system works.  (I could be way wrong though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
From the other side of the coin, a high level guild typically strives to equip it's members well in the interest of advancing the GUILDs power and prowess, much more so than the individual.  It stings for the guild to lose any contributing member.. period. <br>
<br>
Things happen, people move on for whatever reasons there may be; however, that doesn't diminish the contribution they made to the guild while they were in it.  <br>
<br>
Certainly not a good situation to be in all the way around.  Hope it works out for y'all.  Dun get ugly.   <br>

A long time ago with LC we got 4 Sceptre of Destructions in one clearing of ST warders.  That one clearing so vastly increased the abilities of us as a guild that they were passed around to whoever was going to be tanking a lot of the time.  There was a certain warrior that sold his when he sold his character and this was totally wrong.  This situation with Slepnir reminds me a lot of that.  I guess I don't have a lot of room to talk since I also ebayed a character with a lot of very good gear, but something that increases the overall ability of a guild like a SoD or BoC which is also droppable is many times kept in the guild as guild property.  If this was indeed the case, I wholeheartedly sympathize with Rel In Por.  But then again my opinion is solely based on what I have read here. <p>Venerable Gimily Smashfist 60th Cleric (retired)<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Veteran Gimilly Smashfist 61st Warrior<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Warrior Chamber Leader<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Fifteen Chambers</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=impudent>impudent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Uber guild basher <br><font color=blue>QC Supporter</span><br>  Posts: 343<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/26/02 11:38:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=702.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hackers/con-artists/low life bitches</span><hr size=1> I agree about the value of a Boc.  I am not trying to dispute that.  If they killed him once, they can do it again. (and again and again and again if needed)<br>
<br>
There are a lot of &quot;if's&quot;.  <br>
<br>
IF.. he spent &quot;raid points&quot;, it belongs to him. (period)<br>
<br>
IF.. the guild considered the BoC as guild property, NO ONE should have had to spend points. (period)<br>
<br>
Can you see the distinction?  The difference is that he HAD TO spend points to get to sword.  Therefore, it became his.<br>
<br>
At this point, the entire topic is mute.  We will never know the &quot;whole-truth&quot;.  <br>
<br>
ANY guild, raid or group that USES a system that costs a player chances at OTHER gear, in order to obtain a different piece, is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>wrong</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to consider ANY SUCH GEAR guild property.<br>
<br>
Just to over simplify things... lets look at a kael raid (ironic :P ).<br>
<br>
A mob drops a BP for thurg quest.  A cleric and warrior both need it.  <br>
<br>
The warrior has 6 &quot;points&quot; saved up (because he passed on roll for arms/legs/boots/helm) from prior raids.<br>
<br>
The Cleric has 5 &quot;points&quot; saved up (because he spent a point on legs) from prior raids.<br>
<br>
The warrior wins because he had more points.  BECAUSE he gave up on OTHER gear, in order to get a better chance at a BP.<br>
<br>
Thats my point.  Pure and simple. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804">Impudent Blasphemy</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
