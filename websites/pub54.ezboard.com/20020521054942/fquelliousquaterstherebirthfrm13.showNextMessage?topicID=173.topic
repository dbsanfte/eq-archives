This is EXACTLY what happened. ADD are the ones who should be hanging their heads in shame, ask Garaddor (long time friend and ADD member) who was present.<br><br>Both guilds show up at KC same time. Both have monks in VS area. Denizens clear into prep room and start buffing. During our clear to room, several ADD people ask to join our raid, or merge with theirs. We politely decline, we wanted to try guild only.<br><br>ADD rushes into room and then proceeds to go over the top of us. They botch the pull (why use a monk when you can harmony?) and get VS +1 in prep room. Our very nervous main tank dies, she wasn't sure what was happening. Yes, 1 warrior, thats all we had.<br><br>We camp out, ADD fail their attempt. We come back and do it right. Now get this.. our strategy the main tank is solo inside VS chamber with him for a period. Whilst she was doing this, and had been for 20 seconds, ADD charges in, in an attempt to KS. Well, we scored the kill despite their attempts.<br><br>ADD had their chance, and it wasnt even a really legit one. They stormed over us, and botched it. Our chance, we did things right. Cry all you want, but I lost a lot of respect that day for ADD.

The wizzy who did it was kicked out of the guild for his actions, and the rightfull person was given the staff by a gm. <br><br>Second... we had ONE warrior, and she was the only person in our raid that died on your pull.  She didn't know who pulled VS, and yes she did attack him right away.  But she was the first person to die on either side, so don't tell me you lost because she got tap'd at the start of the fight.  And besides, even if it did tap leylani, do you think it would have magicly NOT tap'd whoever on your raid who was tanking him?<br><br>Ok, I will give you guys the benifit of the doubt, and say you were the first, I wasn't on right when the servers came up so I don't know for a fact.  But talking with people on both sides it sounds like both guilds got there about the same time.  Ok, so if you were there first, you guys DID get the first shot at him.  I'm sorry but our 1 death wasn't going to change the outcome.  We all camped out as soon as you guys engaded VS.  We all came back after you guys whiped out, and you guys started rez'ing.  We buffed up, cleared the few mobs that had re-poped in his room, and went to attack him in his room.  We sent Leylani in as tynan said to get agro on him, as she was our only tank and needed her holding agro.  At that point some members from ADD rushed in and started hitting VS too.  We got the kill though.  And yes he really did drop a Wizzy staff and CB legs, we have no reason to lie.  Also a star ruby, and the non-epic wizzy staff if ya relly want to know.<br><br>I personly have some friends in ADD, and have respect for a lot of thier members.  I talked with some after and thought everything was ok, or at least we had some kind of understanding.  I will say some of the things said were far from &quot;right&quot; and I wont say I agree with all that was said in the least, but I did have a talk with the person, that isn't waht we are about.<br><br>Just put yourselfs in our place, would you let a raid that had just failed on VS go again when you had a group able to kill him ready and buffed?  I think we put a fair effort in staying out of your kill as much as possible.  We all camped out, you can't effect a raid much less than that.  Yes we had one death, but that was at the start of the fight which made no differnce in the end, and really we are lucky we only lost 1 person from that pull.<br><br>Lastly, thanks for the people who stuck up for us, I hope most people realize we are far from a guild that looks for trouble or ks's ect.  That just isn't what we are about.<br><br>Ps. Kaastle, ya know you should really think before you speak, you just made yourslef look like a total fool.  And any point you might have remotly had was lost in the stupid comments you made. &quot;Dorkison's of Shitzbaroom trailer trash&quot;, I love when people say that stuff but yet know abslutly NOTHING about us, not even our guild name (ok i admit it isn't the most common of names), but didn't even get one member in our guild's name right.  But yet he knows we are trailer trash *shrug*.  O well, I personaly have no lasting ill-feelings for ADD, and I hope the rest of ADD feels the same to us.  Trust me we in no way wanted it to come out like it did, but @#%$ happens.<br> <p><center><bold><font color=red>Lotan - 60 Rogue<br><font color=gray><a href=http://go.to/eqdenizens>Co-Guild Leader - Denizens of Shez'Baernon</href></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/24/02 11:45:15 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Denizon's KS of VS 1/9/02</span><hr size=1> Sorry but I used to know Raluvin... great guy, helped my friends and I rescue someone that had forgot to rebind after a naggy raid quite a while back.  Dont just try and drop names of someone cuz they have a level 60 character as if that makes some kind of difference to the situation.  Just wondering how someone in ADD picked up that character along the way....  All I can say is at least it wasn't Juzzam (you know, ninja looting tormax head pally, thinks you can get transed out of VP, nice guy).  Why anyone would buy a char w/ a tarnished rep is beyond me... why someone would let their rep get tarnished by letting some newb running around in PoH on a twink on Ravulin's account is also beyond me.<br><br>P.S.  If by some odd stretch of the imagination it was the real Raluvin (highly doubtful cuz I know he quit for a while and had someone else playing his char) then I'm sorry for the accusations that I've made.  *However* it is highly odd to get trained repeatedly within seconds of a monk fding right next to you without it being intentional.  It also made no sense for him to remain near us as he searched for the dead chars since we were on our way to 2nd floor anyways and not going anywhere near the location we told him the corpse was sensed to be. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46578"> Salta </a><br>Phantasmist<br><a href="http://www.lotuscult.com">LC</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufaie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/24/02 11:55:24 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Denizon's KS of VS 1/9/02</span><hr size=1> I wasnt there for the VS fight but just curious....why wait weeks to flame?<br><br><!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~ajleak/catherine/faie-sig-2.jpg align=center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ulotaneq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LotanEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/25/02 12:41:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Kitties!</span><hr size=1> edit: lol gah, my RL best friend is a dork =p <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ulotaneq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LotanEQ</A> at: 1/25/02 6:17:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umalloxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malloxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>One minute Maalox</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/25/02 1:25:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kitties!</span><hr size=1> omfg khaleon i like died when i saw that lmao<br>poor lotan so got tooled=p<br>p.s. i'm sure you can all tell thats not lotan;p it's the crazy sob enc named khaleon who's a freak so don't think it's lotan who forgot to take his prozzak or something =p <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umalloxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malloxx</A> at: 1/25/02 1:26:49 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umalloxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malloxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>One minute Maalox</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/25/02 1:33:22 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Kitties!</span><hr size=1> gah i just noticed my board title.... sob ;(  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/urhesolooshun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhes Olooshun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master of Dice</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/25/02 4:26:29 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Concerning Raluvin</span><hr size=1> Uhhh, I wasn't gonna post on this thread until I saw Raluvin brought into it.  <br><br>I know from talking to the actual Raluvin that his warrior was brought into ADD by Banelion while he was taking a sabbatical.

Number one I was out of line in name calling and the whole trailer trash thing.  But the monk from your  guild did talk pretty bad to us and you guys didn't seem too nice at the time this all went down.  Yes I am biased because It has been my dream to have some Cobalt Pants and I was the only warrior there for ADD that would have gotten the loot.  <br><br><br>I did report his comments and spoke with a GM about the whole issue and they said they were reviewing the situation.  I think that the fair thing to have done would have been to at least agree on who was there first and admit who actually had the camp.  And when we come back and get ready to try again you guys rush in.  <br><br><br><br>I didn't know of this board till two days ago is the reason why I haven't posted this earlier.  And the reason I found out abou this board is a LC chanter told me of some neat stuff on this board.   Yes I have been angry about how the whole situation went down.  Seeing how the Legs went into Denizin's Bank shows they didn't need them.  All I ask is in the future be nice to others.  My whole reason for posting is the attitude and language used to all of us from that monk in your guild.  <br><br><br>Raluvin is back...and I was letting you know who it was....not name dropping.  The monks name was Roluvin wasn't it?   I just hope I don't have a reason to post anything else here....Later guys<br><br><br><br><br>Kaastle Speedmetal <br>56 Myrmidon <br>At Death's Door<br>Quellious <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ureisswolff.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reiss Wolff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/25/02 9:11:28 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Concerning Raluvin</span><hr size=1> Well if the Monk belonged to Raluvin then it was his human monk Roluvin.

You guys rushed over the top of us. No need to deny it, WE cleared into the prep room, your force wasn't there. You guys had a clear run from zone to room, then rushed passed us, and messed up the pull. THAT was your attempt.<br><br>Do you seriously think that if two guilds are aiming for the same mob, if one fails, the other will just watch as you try again? Please tell me you don't.

We did have a war how would use them.  He just wasn't able to make it to the room at the time, and it took us a few days to figure out who we were going to give them to.  And no he isn't someone's twink =p<br><br>But we didn't really kill vs for the legs anyway, we wanted the wizzy epic staff and we were lucky to have it drop.  But having the legs drop was a nice bonus, and made a very happy warrior in the guild who hasn't been to ToV yet.<br><br>But anyway, thank you for apologizing, and I as I said before this wasn't the way either side of this matter wanted it to turn out, but it did =/ <p><center><bold><font color=red>Lotan - 60 Rogue<br><font color=gray><a href=http://go.to/eqdenizens>Co-Guild Leader - Denizens of Shez'Baernon</href></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uminitankstylee.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MinitankStylee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/25/02 2:11:13 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Concerning ethos</span><hr size=1> Wait a sec ....<br><br>Cobalt legs went into the bank!?  eek!

But, I have a really hard time beleiving that an experienced warrior (Raluvin) would be so dumb as to train the safe camp with a monk.  I mean, if he accidentaly got aggro, he could always FD AWAY from the camp ....  the only way a monk trains you is because they're a friggin newb or because they did it intentionally.  By Kaastle's reference to LC as Lewtus Cult, I'd assume it was intentional.  I'm sure he did not make up that witty name all on his own ...<br><br>Combac.  Stylee.
