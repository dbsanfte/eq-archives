Faetal a lvl 9 Iksar monk was hanging out at our raid site hitting mobs and getting himself killed etc he appears to be bound there I presume to ninja items etc. Well anyway's after the raid someone told the raid channel that Faetal was in EC after we had spent some time xloc'ing him and others that were in our camp area. So I logged on my Necro (Bezel) as I was attending raid as my Shaman to attempt to buy boots from Faetal here is a hastely edited log of my chat with Faetal. I would encourage if any of you were on this raid also you contact the server gm etc.<br>
