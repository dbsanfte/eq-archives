<br>
It really is a matter of taste.  Either people will play the old models on their screens or the new models will grow on them.  I liked them from the start.  The new models, I think, fit what the characters are suppose to be... hell we are warriors out there.. slaying mystical monsters..  There is no time for cute little girls running around..  It is time for the women, those that were trained for battle to be out there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As a female that has put herself and body through a intense weigh lifting phase as well (no longer waaaay too much work).. I rather like the buffness of the new models.  I find a well toned body attractive... which some find unattractive.. I could remember my mother saying something along the lines.. &quot;You're not going to get too musclar are you?&quot;.  It just isn't &quot;natural&quot; for a female to be built.  I say.. &quot;Screw that&quot;! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Although I didn't have the dicipline to continue so now I am back to my skinny little self.  <br>

Well, for the horses greater than 50k.<br>
<br>
Bought the 100k horse a few days ago and it OWNS.  It's as fast as a level 60 Shaman's sow.  The problem, obviously, is that most people don't have 100k just sitting around.  However, if you can afford it, I highly recommend it.  Makes outdoor pulling far easier and makes traveling a breeze.  Especially on those runs through ToV or through Luclin or wherever.<br>
<br>
There are also a lot of pluses to horses:<br>
<br>
1) They can't be dispelled - huge plus when pulling dispell mobs outdoors (fear for example).<br>
<br>
2) They zone with you if they can be in the zone.<br>
<br>
3) They look cool, but most people have the new models off anyway so most of the time people don't mention it - They just notice me running past themselves with sow or jboots and think to themselves &quot;wtf?&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, if ONLY they would have them all modeled after famous sex symbols.  Hell, I'd pay 200k to ride around on Pamela Anderson in Norrath.  Besides, it would be sticking to their current precident. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usfemwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>S Femwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/11/01 1:31:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The new models</span><hr size=1> Well if your going for realism as warriors, I think you need to cut down about 3 cup sizes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
I cant see any of the SoL females running, muchless swinging a weapon.<br>
<br>
I do, however, like the look of the new armor.<br>
I personally think the half elves look the best, atleast the ones Ive seen, they have always been a touch masculine anyway. The pics of the High Elven women dont look too bad either...besides looking a bit geriatric.<br>

Haven't managed to put any screenshots up of Catalyn yet, but she looks a thousand times better than before. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Despite the fact that SOME people *glares at Shagbert* don't seem to like her new spiky blond hair and red tattooes, I think she looks great now. Very.. uhhh....formidable. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Jaundiced Bone looks VERY nice on the new barbarian models, just a shame I don't have more of it, lol.<br>
<br>
I like my human monk as well. Maybe she looks a little bulkier than before, but she's been running round for fifteen levels now kicking and punching things until they fall over - are you telling me she's still going to be a skinny, scrawny little thing? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Her white ponytail looks good too - makes her look like some kind of kung fu mistress, lol. Just a shame she's been stripped of equipment and doesn't get played any more.  *sigh*<br>
<br>
However... the female wood elves look damn ugly now - sorry if you're a wood elf out there, but the noses are all pointy now, lol. I was most disappointed when I did /facepick on my wood elf ranger. And what have they done to the Dark Elf sentient helm graphic? Where are the cool spikes? Now I just look like a skin head! *cry* And the Erudite female... I haven't even dared to log her on yet, but from screenshots I've seen, she's going to look like a Klingon who's lost a fight with some sandpaper.<br>
<br>
Horses are very well done - they have the paces right and everything. But come on... the halfling corgi's do look a little silly compared to the barbarian's war horses. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My main is a human monk.  I have to disagree with the thought the thought that females should be muscular to the point that we could compete in the Mrs. Universe body building competion.  Olympic athletes don't bulge like the new human models.  And they sure as hell don't have breast implants.  Granted this is FANTASY but I don't want to look like a comic book character either.   I thought Verant was sexist before with the panty lines showing and breast showing....one of my guildies says he wouldn't be surprised now if they introduced trampolines into the game.....hmmmmmm.

Desjardins told me I looked cool.  Later Aianai says I look like a cross between Green Lantern and Thor.  Now having seen it for myself, I'm going with Aianai on this one.  I look like the bastard love child of Hal Jordan and the son of Odin.  My poor little WE ranger looks like an extra in a Sally Stuthers infomercial.  My ogre?  WTF?  Before ogres had that goofy charm that just made you want to mispell everything.  Now they're just kinda creepy.  The women, even though it's nice the first time ya see the gigantoboobs, it gets old quick.  And we won't talk about how horsefaced they are now.   At least VI got rid of the package the women had in the early screenshots.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of SOL, I'm lovin it.  The zones look great when I can actually turn my clip up high enough to see em.  There's plenty to hunt for everyone.  The quests actually give items that are decent instead of the normal 3gp, a rusty, and some faction.  Plus, you can solo on the high end of the game if you want to now, regardless of class.  That was needed a long time ago.  Sure it's a social game, but there's times when you log in when you just don't want to go through the hassle of sitting at a zone LFG for hours.  The adv skills are kinda cool.  Glad to see DAoC had this kinda impact on EQ.  After all the bugs are worked out of this expansion, this game is gonna be great. <p><Br>Gaeaan<Br>The Simpler Templar<Br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22094" target="_blank">GUBER Gear(tm)</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umorditashkarii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mordi Tashkarii</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Stinky</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/18/01 8:14:37 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: models</span><hr size=1> Well, I kinda like the new models too... well at least I like the way I look.
