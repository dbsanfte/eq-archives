For anyone who has done this, you know how long and boring this camp can be.  When I logged on around 7am est, she had been there for a couple hours already.  When I came home from work, she was still at it.  I checked in with her a few times in the evening to keep her sane.  In the wee hours this morning, she sent me a tell saying that a troll shaman named Otok from Ritual Misery (great guild even if it is evil... this is not a slam against them) walked into her camp and killed the AC which had just popped while she was medding (she's only 34 so she still had book in front of her face), got the rare drop (not sure how she knows this but she swears that Otok did), and then left the zone.  <br>
<br>
She reported Otok but the GMs of course refused to do anything since there were no eyewitnesses and she really had no way to prove that she had been camping the AC all day.  When I suggested that she talk to RM about incident, she replied that it would do her no good since she was alone, had no clue where to go or whom to approach about it, and doubted that anyone would listen to her in any case.<br>
<br>
This statement upset me more than the fact that she didn't get item (she can buy that.)  I like being part of a guild but to think that I would be treated differently and not have the same opportunity to file a complaint when someone KS'd me were I an independent reeks.  When someone KS'd the no drop +6 WIS morningstar in Kith from one of our rangers, we banded together to track down the person who had done it then reported him to the GMs and his guild.  His inventory was checked and he was forced to apologize and item was removed from his account and put into hers.  Does one have to be in a guild to get fair hearing and justice if it's proven that they are telling the truth?  If so, that really sucks. <p>Juror Seraphim<BR>

GM couldn't do anything even if she could prove she was there for100 hours straight... <br>
<br>
I know I've commented on first come / first serve before.. and I agree with FFA also.. And a WIDE open zone can't be claimed / camped in my book...  BUT... <br>
<br>
In a closed confied area like the AC camp in Lower Guk...  where really only one person can camp... all others should just wait their damm turn.. <br>
<br>
Hell, I use to just bind there.. and every once in awhile gate to check it out.  This shaman either #1 didn't see her...  #2 didn't want to wait his turn and put in the hours...<br>

Or send me a tell directly.<br>
<br>
Otok has always been a very fair and kind player, and I am sure there is some sort of misunderstanding, if it comes down to it, Ill reimburse her with some legs I have in bank.<br>
<br>
The only reason she wouldn't get the same treatment as sonmeone in a guild, would be because she didn't step up and take the initiative. We may be an evil guild, but the hell if we condone griefplay, KS'ing and the likes, even in a FFA enviornment. We just need to be aware of the situation to take action <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have been looking for her but haven't seen her online since then which is a little strange since she was almost always playing at least some of the time that I was either in the morning or late at night.  She really should be the one to speak to an officer since only she tell her tale from beginning to end.  I will also send her an email.  Hopefully I will catch up with her soon and convince her that someone will listen to her.  I don't know Otok.  Hopefully he just didn't see her sitting there or thought she wasn't camping it anymore.  I hate to see shamans of any race accused of misdeeds.  <p>Juror Seraphim<BR>

Otok hasn't been online last few days, but I will be confronting him on this particular incident.<br>
<br>
From what she told me, it was rather rude of Otok and completely out of line, yet it didn't really break any game rules, but still rather unpolite. I still can't pass judgement on Otok till we get to hear his side of the story though.<br>
<br>
We try to encourage our members to be understanding and fair when it comes to situations like this, but sometimes people slip up or bad judgement is used. I apologized to Lily and promise to have a talk with Otok, and thankfully she was a very kind and understanding person.<br>
