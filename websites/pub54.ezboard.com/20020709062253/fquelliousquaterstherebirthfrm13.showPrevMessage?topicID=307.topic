(trying again - got time at work=))<br>Nice reading to all you readers out there.<br>This flame is toward all Ebayers or people who want to become instant experienced level 60 characters.<br><br>This is just my opinion, flame me, flame them, flame away...<br>Here is one of my most recent experiences:<br>I will refer to them as Ebayer_01 and Ebayer_02, no need to tarnish any names &lt;Could be an innocent mistake on my part&gt;.<br><br>I log on the other day to work on some AA exp and try to get a step closer to my MB toy.  &lt;-- wizard btw.<br><br>Cleric_01 tells me: Want to join an AE group? meet at portal.<br>Woot, seb disco AE group - nice start.  I head to portal and find group fighting with about 4-5 mobs mezzed.  Cleric, Pal, Ench... Dead wizard.  Dead wizard and rest of group alive?  &lt;-overnuke, aggro management?  I only thought of this later after grouping a bit longer.  &lt;learned lvl 30ish about overnuking and taking aggro from tank = death for a wizzy - although it happens with us trigger happy wizards now and then&gt; (Concussion Spell).  I had seen this wizard around throughout my levels and guessed he knew what he was doing.<br><br>We clear the trash.  Nother ench shows up - that makes 60 wiz, 60 wiz, 60 ench, 55+ ench, 58 cler, 55+ pal.  Not too shabby for ae group, piece of cake in seb.  Pally and myself were designated puller.  <br><br>First pull - about 25+ close to 30 mobs.  I nuke all my mana and harvest.. mobs still not dead wtf?  Other wizard says: OOM - wtf?  I look around and see him standing off to side and nuking.  We all died =/<br><br>I ask Ebayer_01: What spells were you using?<br>Ebayer_01 says: Pillers (Pillar of flame I am guessing).<br>Ahh, I see thats why you were off to side nuking, but you need to use jyll's line of spell.  &lt;--PBAE spell.  Innocent mistake? NOT - &lt;--level 60 wizard, AE group, pull of 20+ mobs?  &lt;PBAE spell learned lvl 50+&gt;.<br><br>We do CR, get settled in and get a rhythm goin.  nice exp.  Ench and myself have to log soon.  <br>Ebayer_01 says: I have a lvl 60 wizard to replace you.<br>Group says: Ok.<br>Ebayer_01 gates/ports (??)  Where ya going?<br>Ebayer_01 says: Gotta go pick up other wizzy.<br>&lt;hmm lvl 10+ I learned wizzies are masters of transportation&gt;<br><br>So we pull and cleric and I kill with ae.  Pally dies and goes LD.  Ebayer_02 joins group.  <br>Ebayer_01 tells group:  Just tell them you are level 60.<br>&lt;honest mistake - happens to all of us, wrong channel?&gt;<br>So I take the liberty to /con Ebayer_02 blue... = &lt; lvl 60.<br>&lt;learned /con mobs/npc at lvl 1.&gt;<br><br>Ebayer_01 and Ebayer_02 at zone - died a couple times trying to get back down.  /shrug not sure what they were doing..<br><br>Cleric says: Drakkun evac us to zone we can start over.<br>You cast Evacuate.<br><br>I help with CR, wish the group some luck.. and headed out.<br>Gate.<br>/camp desktop.<br><br><br>Cleric and enchs were good - maybe thats why we lived so long =)<br>Don't get me wrong they seem like cool people, just not level 60 experienced players.  Might have been someone else playing their char for what I know.<br><br><br>Drakkun<br>SorcererLFG<br>afk: AE? whats that American Eagle?<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usorcererlfg.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SorcererLFG</A> at: 5/16/02 10:47:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uzaphirien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zaphirien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Quiet One</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/16/02 1:51:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=314.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where's all the flames?</span><hr size=1> My worst Ebayer experience was also in Seb, going to the Crypt.  We've got a solid enough group for it - high lvl Ench and Shaman, I was 51 or 52 Cleric at the time, plus Monk and 2 other melee.  Monk is 58-60, somewhere in there.  We get down to the Crypt because NG was camped, easy enough.<br><br>Us to Monk: &quot;So, you gonna pull then?&quot;  We all figure this is sort of a 'duh.'<br>Monk: &quot;I don't really like pulling, I suck at it.&quot;<br><br>HUH?!  Why the hell are you playing a Monk then?  So we do well enough without him pulling, but all throughout the camp he's asking really dumb questions.  We're all getting suspicious.  Eventually, Ench has to leave so we start heading back out.  We get to front of Crypt and there's a full pop of mobs that NG hadn't cleared for some reason.  Monk goes out to them, we figure he's finally gonna FD pull for once.  Nope, he runs right through 'em trying to just zone.  Since there were about 5 frogs and he apparently had NO clue what Feign Death even is, he dies.  We had started to run up behind him, so when he dies they all come back to us.  <br><br>In the end, I think 4 of us died including him, plus a few from NG group.  A simple fight-out turned into a fairly lenghty CR.  And then he gets pissy when I bitch him out for being a dumbass cause, ya know, I kinda dislike needless deaths that stem from stupidity.<br><br>If you're going to Ebay, you could at least have the courtesy to do some basic research on your class before you start playing, not to mention maybe honing your skills in easier places before you impose yourself on the greater grouping population. <p><center><font color=green>52 Ranger</font>and<font color=blue>53 Cleric</font><BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=55351 target="web">Zaphirien</a>and<a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49046 target="web">Zaphran</a><BR>The Apostles of Insanity</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uacturian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Acturian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/16/02 2:06:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=314.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Where's all the flames?</span><hr size=1> what about the people who buy cleric/druid bots for AA .. are they just as evil ?

We needed... well, desired.. a cleric and another melee.  I invite Arariana (cleric) and she insists that I invite her husband Radorpike, 52 or 53 bard, so I did.<br><br>Keep in mind we had a 60 shaman with Acumen and group Regrowth.  We get down to chef and the bard starts mixing Jaxan's Jig o'Vigor with the level 5 healing song thing.  I sent him tells asking him to play more productive songs such as clarity or ... ANYTHING BESIDES JAXAN for christ sake.<br><br>To make a long story short, Arariana and her hub Radorpike were complete morons when it comes to skills, and Gorce ended up saying &quot;I would rather solo than group with you two.  Leave now.&quot;  We all laughed and they left.  The 4 people remaining seriously killed faster than we did with those two there, don't ask me how.<br><br>I later learned/heard that Radorpike is an ebayer.  Not sure if it's true or not, but good lord, if you are level 53 and playing Jaxan's Jig o'Vigor, you can freakin lick my ass.
