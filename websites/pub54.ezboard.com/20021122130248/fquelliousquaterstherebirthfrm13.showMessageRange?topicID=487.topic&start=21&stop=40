<br>
Wizards are powerful at 60, no doubt about it. But it depends on 50+ days of playing a character that is almost impossible to PL in any way other than KEI.<br>
<br>
There should be some appeal to groups at all levels, not just the last level.<br>
<br>
But instead theyre making clerics who already are essential in most groups even better.<br>

Do any of you honestly think clerics will be getting much? <br>
c'mon, havent you seen our last pet?

They are just trying to even out the grouping and give us options when all the groups are filled with attention starved solo'ers.<br>
<br>
-Please dont take offense to that druids, if I chose a class that solo'd most of EQ I would be starved for attention too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   -<br>

I agree there are many classes that need changes, cleric is not one of them. Yet,  I feel the abilities they are giving us is just a way to counteract what they are giving druids.<br>

I do the same as you Miina, when I know the heals are safe I cast a few Judges and stun the mob as its running away, beat it up a lil bit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

that was my first reaction. more and more classes are getting to do what clerics used to pretty much monopolize. on the other hand, that was pretty  much ALL clerics could do. I kinda liked it that way...<br>

It seems like so much is getting changed in one fell swoop that I will just have to wait and see when I have these spells myself.<br>
<br>
I like to melee, and I know i do really shitty melee damage, but its fun.<br>
<br>
This change on test is in response to improved druid and shaman healing.  At level 54 druids will get a 75% CH that does up to 3000 hps of healing.  Now tell me if a druid could not replace a cleric in most experience groups with that heal.  Places like Sebilis, HS, FG, and Velks, which are the busiest experience dungeons, at this point a cleric is not even needed.  In any of these zones I do nothing but nuke and melee and desperately look through my spellbook trying to find some sort of helpful spell i can cast.... and there are none but healing... which I only have to use once every 5 minutes or so.<br>
<br>
The new heals will make it equally easy for a druid, shaman, or Cleric to do the same job in most experience zones, as well as give them something useful to do on a raid besides cast circle of seasons or sit around waiting to reslow mobs.<br>
<br>
This means raids will not have to depend so heavily on X number of clerics, which I find very positive, and is one of the main reasons why I do not enjoy raiding.  If I have to log so will the rest of the raid if soemone can not be found to 2box me.<br>
<br>
The downside of these heals will be that clerics will not be nessecary in &quot;most&quot; experience grind groups, as the groups will be able to run just as efficently without them.  Clerics will only be needed to give buffs and resses in these zones.  Seriously, when is the last time a tank actually needed buffs in Fungus Grove or Velks anyways...<br>
<br>
Without a group a cleric is crippled plain and simple.  THis class completely depends on grouping for experience.  Clerics can in fact solo at lvl 60 with 500 quadzillion AA points and an arsenal of ubergear, but still the ability to gain experience doing so is not nearly as good as grouping or being a monk or a ranger soloing in fungus grove.  <br>
<br>
These cleric changes are designed to counter that.  If a cleric cannot find a group because other healers have filled the gap with thier 75% CH, a cleric will now be able to solo more effectively.  If a cleric does have a group where they do not need to heal often, they will now have something to do besides sitting there and leeching experience.<br>
<br>
After writing this I think I do in fact feel optimistic about the changes and am eagerly waiting to test them out myself!  It might even pull me back from SZ for a day or 2 =P.<br>

<br>
What exactly did I say that was whining? I said it would be NICE to have all casters melee for just a bit so they wouldn't have to sit down so much while exping in a group.  If they give better melee to clerics it should go to all casters Int or Wis.  From my experience Casters are generally NO FUN in exp groups or farming settings..  It has nothing to do with being balanced or overpowered.  It's just the way casters are.. Whenever I get a group urge I go play my ranger but again it would be nice to be able to stand more.  Oh and Winor I said do more damage with melee not cause wizards need to do more damage but because wizards need to do more than sit most of their lives.<br>
<br>
Ouze you are looking at the wizard public image instead of looking deep into the class.. I feel wizard damage is fine but as Blal said younger wizards suffer. Don't deny it cause its FACT.  However it looks like they are doing Wis caster balancing first cause its really the most urgent.. I remember reading somewhere on the boards that direct damage balancing was last.. Which would make wizards last.  And no I don't feel wizards need too much at 60 and beyond but upping the damage on the younger wizard nukes is needed.  However if you think wizards beat rogue damage now (debatable) what happens when PoP comes out? <p><center>

<br>
1)  Druids are a grouping class.  I don't know many soloing druids, cause I spend all my time grouping, but the druids I do know are groupers, not soloers.  Soloing is incredibly boring.  Why play an online game to solo?  I never could figure that one out.<br>
<br>
2).  I use DA all the time.  Duoing with a monk?  Monk getting beat on, cast that CH, boom, mega aggro, DA, its all good.  I remember the first time we killed one of the Brothers, Quinn I think, (all because Xabatar is too lazy to camp Raster), Quinn was beating the crap out of the warrior, I started casting DA about a second after the warrior started to fight, I think he was at 4 bubbles, by the time the CH landed, he was around 1 bubble.  Needless to say, I smacked down my DA hotkey and Quinn went back to beating on the warrior.  If druids don't get DA, and Verant doesn't cheapen heal aggro, there is going to be a huge increase in the number of dead druids.  If your druid is your evaccer, and you don't have a resser, this may pose problems.<br>
<br>
For those that like to fight totally safe fights with low blues for fastest exp gain, then yeah, druids can easily replace clerics (but in that situation, they can now anyways).  I don't really see druids soloing for 54 levels suddenly being welcomed into groups at 54 to try out their hot new CH.  I know several druids in my guild who I am confident can handle CH duty, particularly for an offtank group.  But there is goign to be a learning curve, just like for anything else.  <br>

If you are doing anything remotely challenging, you are going to want a cleric or pally to be there to res.<br>

Why fight something you know your going to win, without a doubt. I play this game for the challenges it provides. So while giving dru's and shaman's better heals, i may still have a dru in my group for snare/evac/buffs, but i'm still going to want that cleric for his actual CH and res. even if dru/shm had their new heals and the clerics had their new damage and pet's n` stuff i would still take a cleric over them any day of the week. so while giving dru's and shaman's better heals to help out, each class is still going to be wanted as they have been. but saying that, clerics have and will always be first or second priority in my group, due to the fact of res. I may not be the most expert exp'er, but i know when i want exp and there is a chance of dying, i could care less a druid could heal good and port around, or a shaman can slow and heal a bit better. because the fact holds a complete heal is a complete heal, and a 56 res is a 56 res. so i don't see how making clerics do more damage with a pet/weapon would make them any more valuable, they are already the most valued class in the game by far IMO. Maybe War's are the best tanks, but they die alot, probably just under the ranger in total deaths. /poke rangers. So why would a warrior or even a ranger for that matter want a dru/shaman over a cleric. even how they stand now. am i right or am i wrong? besides if you can't find a cleric for the life of you, but if thats how it is, i would much rather just not exp myself. due to the fact i don't exp alot, i just can't spare the exp loss when it take so long for avid players to lvl. I'm not talking bout crazy people who get power lvled, or just exp grind till they can't think. i'm talking about the people who exp when they want, and raid/quest when they can. this is EverQuest not EverExp.<br>
<br>
I just don't see why SoE/VI or what ever they call them selves now, think a cleric is less wanted then shaman or druid even with a better heal. I'm not saying it would off set the game to give the clerics a better chance of hitting a mob, or what ever. but Why would you put your cleric in danger of dying? DA's are nice, clerics get 2 of them. but when those are used up and your done hitting the mob go to sit down, i think not. Either they have some crazy idea of tweeking with the game, or i just don't see the game how they or other may see it.<br>
<br>
I really like what people have been saying on this topic, because even though i've been away for 2 1/2 months i still remember how to play, and what it means to be on the hate list. Maybe someone else could actually give a good reason besides, oh dru's get this and shaman's get that, so cleric's should get this as an answer to the preist class. because logiclly it doesn't make sense. What do others think, i want to hear more. i'm sure others have similar idea's or completly different ones. speak up i would like to hear, because i feel to one sided on this topic.<br>
<br>
Again, i don't think it would mess up EQ as a game, but as a roleplayer it may seem a bit odd, and in bad judgement. but thats me, and your you, so lets hear it. VI/SOE if you troll these boards maybe you have a better explaination. mabe not who knows. i just think this should be looked at a bit closer then how it is shown. maybe it has, but i'm not a tester, so i don't know what PoP is going to be like, or how it will make the cleric class still the best healer, but more wanted in groups. <br>
<br>

its late here, so some of this may sound like jibberish, so sorry if it does. but i feel strongly about what i say, until i hear good hard evidence, to why it makes them more wanted. maybe more wanted to be played? doubt it but maybe.

Perhaps giving something to paladins too though? <p><center>

You guys say wizards are balanced at 60, and I will have to take your word for it, and it's the younger wizards who need it. A few weeks ago, on a HoT raid I was so impressed with Jinnikinics mighty nukes that I finally started a wizard on my own. He's level 29 night, so not uber, but not really a noob anymore - and I have been pretty happy with him. I know he can't melee to literally save his life, but is that really so bad? I think all the classes need defining features, or we have 13 different models of battlemages. My little wizard doesn't melee, but that's below him, anyways, that's for the more savage melee classes... let them get all dirty and sweaty <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I can't comment on getting groups to much though, cause I don't do pickup groups anymore. Long ago I realized that most zones are populated with far more idiots then sarnaks and frogloks, and I pretty group exclusively with my guildmates.  <p><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22703"

Almost Complete Heal? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) is to get more high level groups out of Velks, Seb, and so forth and into the upcoming PoP, I like this a lot.<br>
<br>
As a druid myself, this is great. I've been kicking my experience meter since Chloroblast because I soooooo need a better heal for raids, and just grouping in general. I don't get a better heal until 60 though, and even that isn't too great. You clerics probably don't know (maybe you have an alt though), but its really freakin' frustrating to keep jumping up and healing regularly in case adds show up.<br>
<br>
I group in Velks quite a bit with my guild, and yeah...I can manage it, but I'd like a little more security. It sucks also in times when you have a bunch of melee on, a named somewhere pops, and the guild gives a big sigh because...there's not enough clerics on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Clerics definitely still have the upper hand on healing though, no doubt that cleric heals are more <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> efficient</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> than anything I can pull. I'd sell my epic if I could, to have that kind of healing power. <br>
<br>
Want to make clerics better soloers? Give them a SoW equivalent at higher levels. That way if Verant's new additives don't work too well, they can at least run their asses off to escape (if you're out of mana or something), or be able to quickly get back to rez themselves. <br>
<br>
One thing I definitely would like druids to get that I should request...more stun spells. There's a couple lightning spells that have a weak stun effect, but they also cause damage. Hook us up with a no damage stun! Would definitely help grouping more if you can stun gate/CH mobs more effectively.<br>
<br>
Shamans need a better heal too! Although I feel sorry for them when it happens...more cannibalizing than before. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
As for wizards in groups...I don't know too much about what they get, but I'll leave suggestions and you wizards out there let me know what you think, and feel free to give examples of what you already have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Wizards = better snares, dots, damage shields? <br>
<br>
I can't list much other than damage type stuff...but you know what would get wizards more groups? Familiars without the fucking flapping sounds.<br>

i dont think wiz want/need dot or DS.  just a better snare (single target snare that last longer than 1 min~) will make them very welcome in group. maybe make their familiar's effect a 'group buff' like bards =P. as of now, whenever i group with a wiz in xp group, mobs just die so fast that less heal is needed for group.

This wouldn't make us better soloers.  Giving us mana efficient nukes/dots or even a snare...that would make us better soloers.  Even when it comes to undead, our nukes/dots aren't too efficient.  I can solo 1 regular mob or 2 undead mobs before I'm oom.  Still doesn't compare to a quad kite.<br>

As for the melee skill they're giving us...our 1hb/2hb skills still only max at 175, can druids/shaman say the same?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><Br><img src="http://home.houston.rr.com/danday/gaeaan/Frankenstein.jpg" border="0">

That is true.<br>
<br>
The lure and draught line of nukes are getting a bit out of date..  Making lures unresistable is a nice step but upping draught damage would be the way to make wizards more group friendly..<br>
<br>
Snare? gah i hate to snare.. I always forget.  I don't think snare would make wizards more group friendly.  Wizards have a bad image in groups cause all they do is sit there... most people who pickup group aren't always the highest quality players.. They never check class websites just log in every day get some exp with a slow group and hope when they reach 60 months from now they will join a fabled uber guild they have always read stories about.  They view classes by what they do in the group not what people say about them..  Warrior rogue monks? they hit things they good.  Cleric? they heal me need dat. Enchanters? they haste me need dem. Shamans? they slow and buff me gotta have dat. Are there any other classes in their mind? no.  This is why all the other classes have trouble finding groups cause people want the fastest exp available and don't want a wizard who sits all the time slowing them down.<br>
<br>
Though it would be controversial.. Make it so all classes can med standing up after 55..  I think that will fix all the classes right there. up their melee skills a bit to give them about a 10 DPS..<br>
<br>
Thoughts? <p><center>

SOLO... That is the reason i don't see how this melee damage/bash would do anything for making clerics WANT to group, if they can solo now, why would they want to group, besides if they are lonely. Thats why giving them those new heals is a good start, but VI/SoE should think of a different answer to letting clerics have the choice of soloing. This is a game of grouping unless your one of those druids and wizards who get to quad kite. who get that because they get to port us around out of their way period. I really think any class shouldn't be able to solo a blue post 46, and be able to do it efficently. thats why they made this game with the group box. don't you think us warrior's who should be able to cut through any mob with 17 others waiting to die. no this isn't Diablo. this isn't a solo game. this is everquest, and to quest more times then not you must have help with it to be completed. <br>
<br>
I also don't think giving clerics an innate SoW effect, would work either, yes they die alot running around. but thats because they messed up. learn new tactics of running around. I have several for running without sow/jboots. this is a game of strategy. I don't want to keep flaming without giving an idea to improve or change this. so i myself think their pet should be even cheaper in mana sence it disappers. and yes it is a pet, so it half retarded. aswell as it will hit harder, with a nasty proc. but it can't be healed by the cleric. it would have to be healed by say a DRUID or SHAMAN sence they'll be getting a new ACH spell. the clerics pet would have about that many HP so it could get a CH but it would be from someone else. this may seem strange, but it might get more dru/shaman/cleric's in groups together one way or another. but these classes really can't tank, so they would a tank or 2 and a caster or 2. say necro for manafeed, or wizard for /evac/snare if shaman in group instead of druid. etc so on and so forth. would that make a bit more sence then letting clerics do more damage themselves, due to we don't want them aggroed, so they wouldn't be healing their pet to get aggro, or be hitting the mob often to increase hate. <br>
<br>
this is coming along, i also like the idea of standing/medding. maybe start at 46, but each lvl they increase the amount of mana they get is more then they normally would standing, but sitting would still produce the most mana efficently, but while they are casting, or standing to just look around, they would be gaining mana. so just as an example.<br>

<br>
i know this isn't exactly how mana regenerates, but this is more of just a system, of how it may improve through your higher lvls.  I'm sure 30 mana per tick may seem like alot, but i'm not a caster and i was just rounding to a number without a decimal so maybe in actuallity it would be like a 46 would be getting 5.259 mana per tick standing up or something like 14.958 as an example.<br>
<br>
but what do i know, im just a warrior.<br>
<br>
I just didn't want to say oh no that shouldn't be, and then not give a probable solution, without making a class do something they normally wouldn't like for an example a wizard meleeing with his new 25/20 staff he found in luclin.<br>
<br>
I really like how this game works, and knowing more about how each class works. but thats improbable to understand it all. I just like to voice my opinion, and think maybe EQ might go dude, your a badass come work for us, =P hehe JK. <br>
<br>
just some thoughts, i'm sure they aren't prefect, but we are working in the right direction i believe. i know we've also got off to who to help other classes, but if you tweek one you've got to tweek the others. one way or another, until a caster is a caster and hybrid is a hybrid, and a tank is tank we'll be having discussions on similar topics. <br>
