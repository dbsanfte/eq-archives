My good friend, Runikon Stormlight, went to turn in his staves for his wizard epic last week.  Well if anyone knows this evidently you become KOS to the final turn mob once completeing an epic.  Well Runi took along his wife who has her epic and the final mob proceeded to attack her right as Runi turned in his staves for the epic.  This forced the MoB to eat the staves since it was in attack mode.  <br><br>Well in most cases you would ASSUME that Verant would just give him the staves back and that be that.  Well no they first make him wait through approx 5 days and at least 9 petitions before he gets a response.  Of which I think he was on 24/7.   Then Verant proceeds to tell him that he shall get nothing back since part of the turn in was a MQ.  They refuse to even give him his staves back that he had on himself.<br><br>Normally I dont piss or moan at all but to me this is a huge injustice to anyone especially someone as nice as Runikon.

The only person who can reimburse epics or do other similar things is the lead server GM.  He is only available to help from tuesday to friday during prime time hours (like 4pm to midnight PST.<br><br>At the same time, the lead GM must get the petition (it takes time to filter the original petition plus notes to him), review the logs, and then make a decision.  I am amazed that with as many petitions that must go to the lead GM, almost all of them are handled in under a week (ie in the first 4 day period the lead GM is available).<br><br>If you want to make sure your entire petition goes through and you get a timely response, I suggest you email your lead GM through the sony webpage.  I did that a while back and got an email back the next day, was told that he would review the logs as soon as he could, and would be back with me as soon as possible.  About 4 days later (on a wednesday night - so his second day back at work), he showed up in Sebelis, fixed my problem, and moved on.<br><br>While Sony may have terrible CS, particularly by phone, I think we are lucky to have had some quality server GMs who take their jobs seriously.  If you expect instant results, expect to be disappointed.<br><br>Finally, decisions regarding epic turn ins are often made by the server GM, but he can and will go further up the food chain if the situation warrants.  I remember when we had a big problem a couple of years ago with a cleric epic, the head GM for all of EQ and 3 server GMs (2 from other servers - don't know which ones) all showed up to survey the situation and after some discussion returned the quest item to the cleric that lost it.
