I am a bit surprised by everyone's reactions.  The only new character model I do not particularly care for are the Erudins.. I believe they went a bit -high- on the forehead.<br>
<br>
Other then that I am very pleased with the outcome.  I don't understand everyone's dislike to the female bodies.. nor to their faces.. I think they are very pretty and have very nice bodies.  Large breast?  Who cares.. in most &quot;fantasy&quot; worlds the female characters have great bodies (Which includes full breasts) be it movies.. comic books.. novels.. so on and so forth.  Unfortunately, breast are what is desired and not just by males.   How many times have you heard a female's reason for getting a boob job.. &quot;I wanted them for me.. to make myself feel and look better&quot;?<br>
<br>
I have two computers that are able to play EQ.  One doesn't have the RAM to run the new models and the other does.  Playing them side by side really is an eye opener... I must say I don't want to go back to the old models.. they just do not compare.. to the point where I am going to buy more RAM for my other computer.<br>

<br>
Would you call the new models superheroes or porn stars? or which particular models would be heros and which stars?<br>
<br>
And another thing: the animations... these have been mentioned.<br>
<br>
Does it boggle anybody's mind how they return to a standing position after swinging a weapon? There are, in my opinion, 3 stances in the old one: the swing, the &quot;ready position&quot;, and the &quot;i'm not doing anything&quot; position.  What the hell happened to the &quot;ready position&quot;??!?!  When I'm fighting something in real life, I sure as hell don't take a swing and then return to the same position as if I'm just standing there - that's when I get my ass beat!  Instead of increasing the polygon count by a factor of 50 so we can have ultra-smooth, pornstar/superhero looks, did they actually think &quot;hey, our animations can be like in Final Fantasy where all the character does is walk out 2 feet and swing a sword back and forth and look retarded!&quot;  In short, the original models had fluid animations; these look like people who don't understand what recovering from a swing is.<br>

THEY STOLE MY GUT!!!<br>
<br>
My tubby little halfling stomach has gone.. the hours and hours of pie eating and beer swilling it took to build up was all a waste *sob*.<br>
<br>
And they also give me beard options that don't include either my old beard OR a normal beard/moustache combo. Instead I can have Yorkshireman style sideburns and tache (but without the flat cap, Whippet or ferret), a beard with no tache whatsoever, or (what I currently have for a laugh) the pencil moustache and goatee of the hero from the Princess Bride.<br>
<br>
Still, at least as a halfling I can now have a close cut bubbleheaded Afro if I really want. Shame I don't get the chance to have the hair from that guy in House Party though. Or maybe some dreadlocks..<br>
<br>
It's also a crying shame that the eyebrow colour doesn't change with either the beard or hair colour. Shagbert is supposed to be blond, but now he looks like he bleaches it and doesn't bother with the eyebrows.<br>
<br>
Oh, and to cap that off, my GF has decided to give her newly Dolly-Parton-Breasted Barb Shammie (Catalyn) some spikey blond hair and some tattoos on her face that appear to be written in some sort of Klingon script. Presumably the tattoos are a warning saying &quot;UberTits coming through, make way!&quot;. Now, if only I could find a trainer who would teach me Klingonaase (yes, I'm that sad that I know the Klingon for &quot;Klingon&quot;, lol), I could translate them..<br>
<br>
Oh, and the horses are nowhere near as useful as Jboots. They have a cast time, they take time to build up speed during which time you get hit lots and probably die, and you can't med on them. But hey, they look cool. Allegedly. I bought my halfling rogue one and it's so small it looks like I'm riding a fecking Corgi dog. A nice clean white Corgi though.<br>
<br>
*sigh*<br>
<br>
Nice new zones though. Shame I can't druid port to any of them. Mind you, even if I could, I'd get sent back to the world server select screen as some sort of penance for daring to try to bloody zone.. <p><h8><font color=#0505ff> <center>Sarcastic? Me?

What I want to know is where the hell are the females that work for VI. I know there are some. How the HELL could they let the huge uber boobs actually get implemented? As a Barbarian, I was always proud of my chest, IMO they were the nicest shaped, and a pretty good size too, not even close to being small. NOW I look like one of those strippers on Jerry who got DDD implants to make more money. Yes, I will honestly say as a REAL female playing female characters, I liked being sexy. But this new look is a joke. <br>
<br>
I have to agree about the Woodelves. I had a cute one with Auburn hair, pouty lips and purple eyes. Now she looks so plain and ordinary. My half elf, I am unsure about. The pixie-ish hairstyle is different, but even with the huge chest, she looks kinda manly, and MAJOR geekfest when she wears a helm, same with the WE. <br>
<br>
The good stuff...the feline females are not so endowed as the humanoids, and when they dance...wooo...Woodelves will now take the backseat to the allure of the feline sex appeal of the gyrating/bump and grinding VS. My kitty looks damn good in her RyGorr and tell the truth guys, more than one of you has hung out at the fire dancers to watch them dancing.<br>
<br>
Some of the new graphics that have hit old Norrath add some new dimension to the ground and the bank in Freeport, but the mobs look the same, a disappointment. The new elementals are a hoot. The first one I saw was a fire pet in SK. And the mage didn't have SoL so I had to explain what he looked like. The first horse I saw was a big white one in TT. Impressive. I don't care how fast they go, so what if she paid 10K for it...it LOOKS good...<br>
<br>
Overall I suppose I am satisfied. I am getting used to being disconnected a couple times a night, and my computer locking up about every 5 hrs. My zone time is down to about a min and a half after the last patch. The new zones are something to be explored, and wandering from the Nexus to find the Kitty City (new catch phrase) the first try was fun and I got to see a few zones where only few had gone before. The next try was much faster, but I didn't feel nearly as intrepid. Not knowing what is waiting for you when you zone is a novel experience.<br>
