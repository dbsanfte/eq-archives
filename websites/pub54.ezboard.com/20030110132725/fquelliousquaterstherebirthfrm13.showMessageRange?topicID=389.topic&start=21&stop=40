Well, If Denia is right, both me, you, and Delores were given misinformation by our people.  Delores and you both said you jumped the triggers first also.  Ledrone also has complete misinformation if he thinks your guys didn't know we were there for cursed, and thinks you had any intent other than to try to force us out.<br>
<br>
I know you guys knew we were there first, and knew we were there for Cursed, and made an informed descision to move in anyway.  Before you had one group in there, Binedina knew we were not backing off cursed, and that we had a crew that had been down there ahwile while we got ppl on for cursed.   I got this directly from Binedina, and from logs from before you guys came to Ssra and she talked with our officer who was already there.  It wasn't something Binedina was happy or gung-ho for, but both sides wanted that mob, neither side was going to back down.<br>
<br>
My crew escalated it with the spawn sabotage... I don't consider us to have any room to talk ourselves up as the &quot;good guy&quot; after that.  That was a conscoius decision on our part to make the matter worse.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Vis was another issue Salta.  Please stop bringing them into this.  At the end of the day Ellise and I talked and things are worked out. <br>
<br>
<br>
The base problem is, you guys and Vis talk the day before/early and go your separate ways... you dont' talk with us.   This worked to an extent for awhile cuz you were still killing things we hadn't progressed to yet.  Now, we are killing the same things, and if you go one way, Vis goes another, one of you is bound to run into us.   Most conflicts with any raiding guilds happen when one steps up into anothers level.  When new folk start making ST keys, when new folk move in to ntov the first time, when new folk start working (&quot;blowing&quot;) AoW spawns, whenever new folk start killing anything that someone else has on their 'priority mob' list. <br>
<br>
That's why there is &quot;wraith hate&quot; pretty much.  When SOL came out Wraith was barely farming Juggs and PoG armor.  To come out of nowhere and grow and improve as fast as we did.... in the last 4 months we've hit every 'hot spot' encounter there is.   The only way to avoid this kind of conflict is to not do the mobs.  <br>
<br>
Folks like Delores and Denia that seem to get thier kicks stirring up the pot on the boards is a separate issue really.  Notice they are both relatively new to their &quot;uber guild&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I just want this over.  Talk with us. Sharing three ways isn't as good as sharing with two, but it beats the hell out of fighting over everything. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

I apologise for trying to stir the pot, that wasn't ever my intention, but my blabbering did seem to just make matters worse.  It just angers me when people make one sided posts or stories, and i feel the need to defend.  I guess i should just realise that this is gonna happen and live with it....<br>

Communication is good and I agree. Trust me there are people on all 3 sides which want to avoid this and I for one promise to make a better effort in future. We must co-exist more amicably or we'll all just burn out faster. <br>

You're right. It may not have happened if someone spoke up the day before. So why wait for someone else to take the initiative and see for yourselves that you're a guild worth acknowledging through someone else's eyes? &quot;The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Man</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is trying to keep us down&quot; attitude is getting a little old.

Despite the apparent lack of communication, LC clearly had the larger engagement force there ready to take on Cursed cycle. Just by PnP alone we could have started the cycle. It was clearly evident that your guild attempted to hijack the spawn by holding a taskmaster &quot;hostage&quot; and not killing him, thus blowing the spawn for us, and buying you guys more time to get people there.<br>
<br>
You KNEW you didnt have enough people for cursed, and instead of give it up (as PnP states), you decided to be nasty about it and try and blow the spawn for us.<br>
<br>
Its the actions of your guild officers in instances like this that shape the server's opinion of you. Theres no wonder you are regarded so poorly by the server population, due to your childish acts like these. Apparently you guys were never taught to &quot;share&quot; or &quot;play nice&quot; when you went through kindergarden.<br>
<br>
LC and Vis have a working relationship on spawns just for this reason, so that we dont bump heads like this. Our officers are mature, and know its better time spent looking for other spawns than fighting, which is why we set up the system in the first place.<br>
<br>
So now a new kid enters the sandbox and needs to learn how to share. As your guild gets more efficient at taking down spawns, the one thing they havent done is to get more mature, particularly when relating to others. Maybe its time you guys got some new officers who are more mature and work well with other people, so that you can better interact with LC and vis, so that things like this dont happen again.<br>

&quot;90% of your posts on this message board are either to fuel a flame or to start one yourself&quot;<br>
<br>
Hi!  This is the part of the forum known as the &quot;flame boards&quot;.  Welcome to it!  Have a look around, you'll see that most other people around here are doing the same exact thing.  Funny that they would choose to do such a thing on the &quot;flame boards&quot;.  Maybe we can gather them all online at the same time so you may lecture us on what the proper thing to do on a &quot;flame board&quot; is.<br>
<br>
Another quote from Denia:<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway, i await your next post, where you try to make yourself seem better than me. Fun fun fun!!&quot;<br>
<br>
I posted about an issue raised in another thread.  My original intent wasn't to make myself out to be any better than you.  You were the one who made personal attacks with the oh so witty comments about recess, my maturity, and getting boners from posting on message boards.  I never made any derogatory comments about you or Gurunt, I merely asked you to get your stories straight.  From your first response where you deemed my writings &quot;not worthy of a response&quot; you have been out to make yourself seem better than me.  Go go irony!  Now you're claiming my posts are only out to make me look better than you when the only person that has done anything of the sort is you.  It's funny that you've tried to take the high road and say &quot;I won't flame anymore because I'd rather not feed people like you&quot; yet you've thrown out more personal insults than anyone else in this thread.<br>
<br>
I raised the Vis issues you had last night mostly because it amused me and I felt vindicated for sitting there 2 hours on Monday night.  I won't even go in to how ironic it is to hear from a few people that Vis cleared the way and were followed up.<br>
<br>
Hopefully communication will get better, both between guilds and in them as wasted time for everyone isn't beneficial at all. <p>Salta

Esmalyn, you did not get what I wrote.  It's ok. Lemme explain.<br>
<br>
I never said &quot;the man is trying to keep us down&quot;, I said we need to be in on the early communication or we will inevitably run into each other.  It isn't about other guys out to get us, it's about other guys not considering or talking with us when they make their plans, and all 3 of us looking at the same mobs. They're not trying to deny us anything, they just aren't taking us into consideration until they find us at the mob they had planned on the day or week before.<br>
<br>
We don't need to ask their permission to do these mobs either, Esmalyn, if that's what you are implying.   When we feel we are ready for a mob, and that mob is up, and nobody is on him.. we just do it.   We're not doing it to screw anybody over, we don't do it because we want to disrupt vis and lotus's sharing.  <br>
<br>
So, we just want to communicate more now, so that we can keep the peace with the top-end game on this server being a three way now.   I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;initiative&quot; if it's not us asking for better lines of communication.   <br>

Najir, let it go.<br>
<br>
I don't know what tattle knew, but Binedina knew we in tended glyphed cycle before you were in zone.  I know this from Binedina herself.<br>
<br>
When I logged in, taskmasters were being killed, we both had 50+ folks.  That's all I know firsthand about that.  I know we had about 30 folks before LC started arriving.   Enough for glyphed at least.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure a number of people on both sides have less than the full story.   <br>
<br>
We both did things that would piss us off if done to us.  WE (my side) do not have fun with that kind of play, we do not want that to be the norm.  <br>
<br>
I can't force you to play nice or to want to work things out peacfully, but I'll ask again, please.    <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

Gemlin.. neither side had a creator crew ready to go at first... you had less than 20 people.   <br>
<br>
The gm was called for a different reason.<br>
<br>
Ellise and I agreed  that the gm was a moron from the start all the way through that issue, and in fact made matters worse by telling each side a different story, and changing his story with both sides. <br>
<br>
We don't have fun with that kind of play.  We don't want that to be the norm.   I can't force you to play nice or to want to work things out peacefully, but I'll ask again, please. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

Gemlin dont try to deny that fact, as it was admited to by some of your members, and Mugen got reemed by some officers of vis for it.<br>
<br>
Then the next fight you send in eye which open doors sendiung line of sight agro on the people sitting in the tunnel between the two doors.   Hence causing a train when we had him at 10%.<br>

Grats on your &quot;win&quot;....  funny thing is you call Wraith zergs, and what ever other names but you had more than 55 for cursed.  <br>

I am an officer of wraith, and I am proud of it.   I tell people to be nice and civil, and not enter /ooc /shout pissing contests with morons that start them.  I tell people NOT to seek revenge when Morons do @#%$ liek stated above, but those days of being nice guy are steadily comming to an end.<br>

-- Gurunt<br>
<br>
And I never said you said it. It's my impression based on other comments you've made.<br>
<br>
&quot;I said we need to be in on the early communication or we will inevitably run into each other.&quot;<br>
<br>
We're in agreement here.<br>
<br>
&quot;It isn't about other guys out to get us, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>it's about other guys not considering or talking with us when they make their plans,</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> and all 3 of us looking at the same mobs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Right-o! Who are you to expect LM, or Vis, or &quot;insert guild du jour&quot; to had better think about Wraith when they're making plans, 'cause gosh darn it, we're that good! <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> there's already been a rapport established between Wraith and other guilds on spawn cycles then I'm off, but going by the enmity displayed and your demand that others make room for Wraith, I'm probably not. The burden to open communication is on Wraith, no one else. Say hell froze over and my guild of two years was ready to take a shot at these mobs. I don't expect anyone to take notice of what we've accomplished 'cause it would lead to other expectations from the server, like immediately taking me into the fold without so much as a little smooching. (Note for those with fragile egos: smooching, you know? Like making an attempt to get along RL, bowing out when necessary--NOT kissing ass.)<br>
<br>
&quot;We don't need to ask their permission to do these mobs either, Esmalyn, if that's what you are implying.&quot;<br>
<br>
Technically no, you don't need anyone's permission.<br>
<br>
&quot;When we feel we are ready for a mob, and that mob is up, and nobody is on him...we just do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is part of the problem. You want to be in on the schedule but are ready to use it to your advantage if the opportunity presents itself. By this statement, LC was just as right to start the spawn because you hadn't. You say you don't want to screw anybody's schedule, but that's what you're doing, then complain that no one takes Wraith seriously. If Wraith makes an honest attempt smooth things over, other guilds make space for them in the schedule <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> within a reasonable amount of time,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and Wraith gets shafted? Well you have every right to bitch/complain/kick for being treated like a two-dollar whore. But until then Wraith is acting like, and being treated like, a red-headed stepchild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugemlin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gemlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/10/02 2:32:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get your stories straight~</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Then the next fight you send in eye which open doors sendiung line of sight agro on the people sitting in the tunnel between the two doors.

Thats really funny how the mobs in the &quot;Buff room&quot; NEVER MOVED. The Golem in the Creator Room aggroed on you.<br>
<br>
As far as Mugen goes. He never casted a spell on your mobs. Ask a GM to check the logs.<br>

Gemlin make sure you get the truth from your guildmembers before you make yourslef look like an ass sticking up for that idiot.<br>
<br>
its also funny how you dont deny sending eyes to @#%$ with the fight.<br>
<br>
Its funny how you guys think that just becasue you were the firt to kill a mob you now OWN it and can control who else can kill or even attempt it.<br>
<br>

Esmalyn,  you still don't get it.<br>
<br>
I don't know how to explain it more simply.<br>
<br>
LC decides to do a mob, talks to Vis, it's all set.<br>
<br>
LC show up for mob and wraith is there.  We fight.<br>
<br>
Part of the issue is 2 weeks ago we were not doing the ssra mobs, so LC and Vis didn't have particular reason to expect us there regularly.<br>
<br>
You still think all of this has to do with one side wanting to hurt the other from the outset, or show up the other.   It's not.   <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>
