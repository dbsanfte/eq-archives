I don't think the Wraith leadership is the most horrible thing ever but there have been instances where I question their actions (and anytime I do question their actions I get branded a troll weeeeeeee).  I guess I'm just used to having a higher standard in regards to leadership is all.  I'm 99.9% certain you can look at the guild leaders of any top end guild on any server and you would be hard pressed to find anyone as kind  as Binedina.  I know for a fact she would never allow us to hold a taskmaster hostage for more than an hour to ruin Wraith's shot at Cursed.  We also haven't trained people out of NToV, broken rotations on more than one occasion (Creator, Emperor), and encouraged our guild to over run the camps of others for shards.  <br>
<br>
I was also pretty disappointed by some posts made by a few people in Wraith that were lies about things I've said.  There was an incident in the auction channel a while back where LC was giving some loser that had ninjaed aow pants a hard time.  Desaran started running his mouth and I basically told him to kiss off and not be so cocky since his guild hadn't even killed aow yet.  Somehow that turned into &quot;Salta says we will never kill aow&quot; which turned into &quot;Salta says we will never beat cursed&quot; which ended up as &quot;Salta says we will never beat Emperor&quot;.  Then the brilliant Droz took it upon himself to post that everyone in Wraith disliked me due to my words about how crappy their guild was.  I called bs on their claims and funnily enough they completely ignored the issue from then on out (it seems that any time I do make a valid point you'll have Gurunt and Ragnarz coming to save the day by saying I'm just a troll and not to respond to what I say... it's a good strat if you like to avoid addressing the issues I've made).  The best part is that in that whole fiasco where LC guildchat was posted in a public forum there you see Salta saying that he had every expectation that Wraith would win that night against emperor.  Kind of puts a few holes in the claims some have made about me eh?  I have made comments in ooc after Wraith wiped out about how safehouse spoilers don't always work but that's a far cry from saying a guild sucks so bad they will never beat a certain mob.<br>
<br>
In any case most of the people that brand me Waif hater are stuck on things in the past.  Wraith has grown up a bit and tends to play nicer with others now and you'll notice I haven't posted much about them in ages.  Of course the same people that accuse me of needlessly holding on to past issues against Wraith are the same ones that will sit here and call everything I post a troll attempt just because of things I've said about them in the past.  I just chalk that up to the good old &quot;it's only wrong when others do it&quot; mentality.  It seems to be quite rampant!  For instance it's cool for Desi to ban me from Wraith boards for a single comment that was identical to one he made but when I as a mod of QC censor stuff censorship is the debil!  Seems the hypocrisy of some know no end.~ <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46578" target="top">Salta</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Coercer<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.lotuscult.com">Lotus Cult</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=warlordette>Warlordette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>F Salta!!!</span><br>  Posts: 247<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/30/02 3:12:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lotus Cult and Wraith - please check this.</span><hr size=1> Salta...while the stuff you post could possibly be the truth, or raise a valid point.

I don't think relations between LC and Wraith as a whole are bad at all.<br>
<br>
In the past we had run ins, mostly due to Wraith killing a mob LC wanted and LC showing up after we got there and telling us to leave.  Not that Wraith hasn't done that recently to other up and coming guilds.... it's nothing special.  Typical competition between the big uberguild and the up and comer.<br>
<br>
Every time we had a conflict with LC like that, both sides followed up immediatly asking to work it out in the future, get in on rotation or agree not to get in each other's way.<br>
<br>
Wraith has never broken rotation.  Not on ntov, cursed, emp.  <br>
<br>
Individuals in both guilds train.  We don't come to the boards to complain about it much.  <br>
<br>
The hate is about the people that throw stones from glass houses.  We get called zergs, even tho combined with reviv we've never been bigger than LC and rarely much bigger than Vis... We are no more angels than anyone on the server but other folks like to make a huge deal of it here, while we don't.   We take it up with leadership  when we have a problem.<br>
<br>
There is a disctinct difference to me, and to most of my crew... between a guild doing something that conflicts with us, or even doing a blatant jerkoff move.... and hating a guild in perpetuity.  Especially when on the whole we work together and neither side as a whole wants to fight.<br>
<br>
Especially so with individuals... we don't let the bad apples make the reputation for the guild. Generally they don't do more than insult and flame at how cooler they are for joining an established guild than folks like Desi are for leading a crew of folks from Velketor to Vex Thall.<br>
<br>
All the major guilds have members that either bailed from or failed recruiting with one or more of the other guilds.  It's simply not our style to point them out with examples to try to make the other guys look bad.  It's nothing special or unique to any guild.  <br>
<br>
Anyone can pull incidents to make any guild look bad, and every guild will defend what they did as the right thing under the circumstances most of the time.  90% of conflicts are one guild shows up with a small crew, bigger crew shows up to take over,  often the smaller crew has not killed the mob in question before.. often the established power guilds have a rotation claiming that mob that the smaller guild is not a part of.   Most any raiding guild has been on both sides of that conflict and feel totally vicimized or justified on whatever side they fell on at the time.  <br>
<br>
The leadership in both guilds work things out fine, that's all that really matters to me.<br>

I didn't really know who you were (like class, guild etc.) until recently. My group was sitting, waiting for the Trial of Execution, with Grongl occasionally trying the trigger phrase to see if the previous group had cleared. You ran past us, spammed the phrase, and got your group in past us. It felt good putting you on ignore, better seeing your corpse in there when we went in next, and best of all when we beat the trial first try to get our PoV flags. And yes, I know one of my guildmates was with you - we weren't terribly impressed with him, either.<br>
<br>
Denia - I did point out that these incidents were all since Luclin was released, and so are all part of &quot;new Wraith&quot;. As for a lack of recent squabbles, I'd suggest that Lotus Cult going to a zone that Wraith couldn't enter and spending 90% of our time there might have had something to do with that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Ragnarz - &quot;elephant memories with selective amnesia&quot;? The events I mentioned are within the past year, and one was one day old when I mentioned it. All the events that my guildmates have mentioned are even more recent within the year. Hardly distant history, no? As for selective amnesia, it's odd how all of us remember things in exactly the same way, isn't it? And I'm certainly not going to ignore recent actions because they're the best indicator of future actions. For example, past actions have told me that Reviviscence is good folk - except when you're taking raid orders from Wraith. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Desi - yes, we have talked. When you were putting together new Wraith, you sent me a &quot;/who all cleric 60&quot; recruitment tell as Biffins. When I asked why Biffins wasn't in Vis Maior, you told me that he was a friend that had given you the account when he went to college. Later, I found out you'd bought Biffins from Eric. Which story is the truth?<br>
<br>
Talk to some ex-Wraith about you? You might not want to hear this, but some of the people most critical of you in our guild are ex-Wraith. I'm not going to get a very good picture of you talking to them.<br>
<br>
So I judge you by the actions of your guild when you're online, since you seem to be the senior officer in charge of a lot of things. Look at the list of things LC members have brought up here - not very impressive, is it? I judge you by the comments you make on your boards. Even a neutral third party like Gaethan finds them boastful. And the comment you made about &quot;no artificial limits on content&quot; was very provocative - does that mean you won't enter rotations if you think you can dominate a spawn, as many have interpreted it to mean?<br>
<br>
Just as PoP was coming out, I was poised to leave EQ and cancel my account. I did not think the core problems with the game could be resolved, and I'd rather do something constructive with my time. Then a close personal friend who was also going to quit told me he wasn't, so I was hovering on the edge of staying or going. That night, in The Bazaar, I overheard this:<br>
<br>
Behemoth pokes Dachunker.<br>
Behemoth says, &quot;HEY BLUE CON&quot;<br>
Behemoth pokes Dachunker.<br>
Behemoth says, &quot;HEY BLUE CON&quot;<br>
<br>
Repeat a few more times.<br>
<br>
That's when I decided I was staying to make sure that morons like Toobay could never, EVER achieve &quot;server best&quot;. I am entirely motivated by the desire to keep Wraith second or third best on Quellious, because of the arrogance and stupidity I see come from that guild day in and day out. I feel that this all stems from the leadership group, as they are the ones that decide guild policy (and most of the complaints you saw above were about guild actions, not individual actions). So that is why my ire is directed at you, Desi.<br>
<br>
Total aside: It's too bad that Deseran is also a Wraith officer, and gets lumped in with them. From the two events that stick out in my mind about him, he seems like a nice guy. (Him shouting for Shihhan to not train us, and a recent humorous post on our message board showing he got the &quot;inside joke&quot; in the update.) Why, I'll say it now - he's arguably the nicest Wraith officer! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.lotuscult.com/"> <br>

Another moment when Salta needs to stick his foot in his mouth. The rotation that was offered to us, was one shot a day. Considering we never expereinced the emp we didnt agree to it we wanted 2 days till we got a feel for the mob.LC didnt want to agree to a 2 day deal. Only after that, we raced a couple times and we got there first the second time (LC clearly saw us there and moved in still, even tho we left the first time when they were they before us) and we actually tried the emp did we agree to a one day rotation after that. Knowing we would learn the strat for the emp reatively quick. So no we didnt break ANY rotation, even at times when last minute rules were thrown in and used against us on rotations. Id avoid commenting on things you have really no clue about Salta, cuz so far least with me, its coming back to smack you in the face every time.<br>
<br>
 As for not responding to you before, when you said the Wraith officers were &quot;lieing&quot;. Thats the typical answer from someone who just got called on their stupid remarks and had them shoved down their throat and couldnt come up with a response better than, &quot;THEY'RE LIEING&quot;. No need to respond to someone who is obviously gutless enough  to not back up his remarks. Nothing was twisted on our end Salta, and anyone with any kind of literacy, and has read your mindless babble and insults can draw their own conclusion whether your the type of person that would make those remarks or not.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;fear Incident&quot;, wow what a surprise to see what thats turned into. Lets roll back to the day of the incident, since the people from LC posting here seem to have such cloudy visions on it. The guild in there was clearing fear for the fun/armor. So someone had asked them if they were planning on CT, they replied they werent. We then asked if they could do us the favor to let us us know if CT spawns. They said sure. Well the usual shout CT doss right when he spawns happened. He was up for a couple seconds and despawned (VI's wonderful way of putting CT on a delayed trigger). The zone repopped, the current guild in their had wiped out, they sent the tell that he was up and asked for help to CR. We said sure and the call was made to move to Fear. No sooner then the call was made, and a few of us were at the portal, wow here comes LC. Thats odd, no LC were in the zone with the guild clearing it according to them. They said they didnt tell anyone else but us that CT was up. Gee wonder how they knew, nah couldnt be coincidence that Annalyse had just left Wraith not that long ago, and was one of the first LC members to come to the zone. Noo Droz, Anna would never do that. <br>
<br>
I formed my opinion, whether it happened or not Anna nothing will change my mind. Your also the one that sent the nasty tells and also took it to RL insults, if you see it any other way you must have developed the same cloudy vision Salta has. Thats also when I lost every ounce of respect I had for you right then and there. To insult me and insinuate I had &quot;trained&quot; you guys in there just showed me your true self. And yes I fired back with a cheap shot at you, and have no problem admitting I was wrong for it. <br>
<br>
Now back to the &quot;train&quot; I supposedly did. Group I was in zoned into fear, got agro right at the zone in, so i made the stupid decision of saying kill it there. Its almost dead, here comes a streaming line of LC in the zone, agroing more mobs which decide to jump us since we are currently killing one. Fine no problem enchanter mezzes we continue killing. Well it finally got out of hand was over 20 mobs at the zone, enchanter was to overwhelmed, and died. The rest died soon after, I tried feigning there it failed. So I get up and run. Guess what every normal person does ever since that zone has been in existance, you run to the wall and to north camp. Anyone disagree with that? So I do what ive always done I start running for the wall hit the wall and turn to start running north. Thanks to my old comp and old Vid card, 30 or so LC froze my screen a second or to. I was quite a ways away from your camp, and I tried turning back and running the other way got stunned so I tried feigning, it failed I was at half a bub of life which turned into a dead Droz. Hence you think I trained you. But heres where your showing your lack of common sense. Your freaking members are the ones that agroed 99% of them mobs, hence why they came straight for you after I died. So in short, you can keep your opinion that I &quot;trained&quot; you or whatever, but you got the facts now. One last thing Disr, Anna, Chunker, and any other old Wraith member in LC knows me better than that. I have only ever trained once, and that was because some idiot thought it was pretty funny killing a quest mob I needed over and over. Believe me if I wanted to train you, it wouldnt of been 3 fear mobs, you would of had the whole zone. As for the Tov deal, I have no clue what your talking about, enlighten me and I wll be more than happy to clear up your cloudy visions there to. Im a blunt individual, and I have no problem admitting to any of my actions, training included.<br>
<br>
As for the thread at hand, I couldnt tell ya Raalf. Obviously the members of LC that are posting here have some kinda jaded opinion of the Wraith leadership, and have formed their opinions on gossip or heresay or clouded situations. As for &quot;hating&quot; I dont hate anyone in the game. Not even anyone in Explicit, if you want the truth. I dislike a few LC members, but for the most part dont know any of them other than the Old Wraith members or the few run ins ive had with the others. So I dont have an opinion on LC as a whole just an opinion on some of the members. If they hate us good for them, im not losing sleep over it and im sure no one in Wraith is losing sleep over it either. They are entitled to whatever they wanna think or form their opinion on.  I write it off due to direct competition, we are right on their backs  competition wise and they soon will have nothing over us or can throw back at us saying you havent killed &quot;X mob&quot; so you suck or you envy us. And yes they have their share of people who like to try and rub our nose in it by braggin we havent killed this or that so LC is better. Just like I know theres people in Wraith that do it to other guilds as well. <br>
<br>
As for bragging that this Gaethan thinks we do, ive only ever seen 3 posts myself posted here on a mob we killed. The recent emp one from Whytspirit, the one from Ketel on Arch Lich, and whoever posted about RoV. All 3 pretty good accomplishments, those people were happy about it and wanted to share it. That a bad thing? Nah not in my opinion, I just personally dont do it. I have yet to see Desi brag on ANYONES boards about a kill we had. Does he have a hilarious sense of sarcasm hell yea. I for one support any updates he does on OUR PAGE. Dont like it, dont read it. Bet that was a ground breaker for you Gaethan. Also, Wraith is the same guild it was 3 months ago. playing the same style. so your ending comment is about as off base as your whole post. Id also have to say RiP is the one that likes to brag, we did &quot;X mob&quot; with X amount of people and we wer ethe first on Quellius to do it! Yea ive read a few updates and find them amusing, but I dont call you on it till now, since you wanna point fingers. I could also toss stupid comments at you and the person that posted how Rip owned AoW. Wow good for you on killing the new Avatar of Vindicator, cuz thats all AoW is now. But brag all you want, it doesnt bother me, have fun with it.I just dont mind calling people and labeling Wraith for things they obviously do to.<br>
<br>
There you have it, the end of my novel. I was only gonna post to help Raalf out with my opinion on whats goin on, which turned into deciding to clear up some of the accusations going on.<br>

Delores:  YOU are exactly what is wrong with Wraith/LC relations.   The kids who have no other interest in game than making life difficult for other players.  That is the difference between us.  I won't say our guilds, because I doubt the majority of LC play soley to irritate, run over, and otherwise make miserable other players.. but obviously those qualities did not disqualify you from membership.  We all make recruiting mistakes tho, so (again a difference between us)  I don't hold LC as a whole accountable for your attitude.<br>
<br>
I almost feel sorry for you, who plays a game not for fun but for malice.  I do feel sorry for those that have to play with you.  From both guilds.<br>
<br>
I play for fun.  I'm proud (at least in a video-game level) of my team and if we are 1st, 2nd, or 24th in server doesn't matter to me.  My goals are to be the best my team can be, not be better than others.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Salta:  Selective memory indeed.   We were not in a rotation for emperor at that time.   <br>
<br>
We talked first.  We gave up our guaranteed shot offered, which you then took, because we disagreed with the rotation as you wanted to force on us.  We didn't take a place in the rotation till after.  <br>
<br>
 We were not going to take a free shot THEN try and change the terms.  However, on what *would* have been our day under the rotation you guys took him.  We didn't mind tho, since we told you we wanted to discuss terms before joining the rotation.  We did race you for it, but we lost, and we held no ill will for it because we asked to not be given a free shot.  <br>
<br>
We both had reasonable offers but both felt strongly about one aspect neither wanted to budge on.   We wanted 2 days to learn him, offered you guys ALL the loot and rifts from the first kill.. you guys wanted no more than one day on him, but did promise we would get a shot per spawn.   Both were fair offers.  <br>
<br>
We negotiated.. in the end we gave in and did things your way.. and you still had kids bitching at us about it.  It really makes it a drag to negotiate with people we know will bitch even if we do everything thier way all the time.  Thankfully, none of the kids that do that actually negotiate.  <br>
<br>
I do wish your officers kept the rank and file more in the loop.  I've been bitched out for moving our turn in a rotation by you guys after your own officers ASKED us to trade.   It's almost comical.   <p>Gurunt Bangoo &lt;Wraith&gt;<br>

<br>
Your lack of literacy is disturbing.  There was a rotation in place between LC and Vis.  You were offered a place in that rotation and you went ffa on it and wanted to do your own thing.  Poor victimized Wraith who didn't get the respect they deserved... who were left out of rotations that were exlusively held by LC/Vis... who cried and bitched on the boards about the evil LC who were monopolizing the content.  Yes those very same people who cried to be included turned down a Vis-Wraith-LC rotation to go ffa and take their chances.  But that's not breaking any sort of preset rotation now is it!!!!!!  I'm waiting for you to go ahead and throw your foot back in your own mouth now Droz.<br>
<br>
You also spoke for the literate masses, claiming that any idiot who's read what I've written knows I'd make a comment like that.  Well for starters you are obviously not a member of those literate masses since you're so ignorant of the English language that you can't even spell 'lying' correctly, but I digress.  I'm still waiting for any shred of evidence that I made such claims.  You can't even name the event, the zone, anything.  I believe it was you that made reference to hearsay and cloudy visions no?  I did say I've made comments after losses using spoiled tactics... I did say I made the comment to Desaran that he hadn't killed aow yet and shouldn't be so cocky.  I'm the one who's brought up things I HAVE said and when I said them.... you on the other hand have nothing to go on but things others have told you.<br>
<br>
In any case I'm still questioning why I was saying you were going to kill emp in the LC guild chat screenshot fiasco yet you claim I said Wraith will never kill emp.  Kind of conflicting information is it not?<br>

Typical Gurunt, distorting to win a straw-man arguement. Let's pick out the mistakes, shall we?<br>
<br>
I'm the issue with Wraith/LC relations: I have absolutely no ability to change Wraith/LC relations. I don't set LC guild policy, and I stay as clear as I can from those Wraith that annoy me. Those that don't annoy me, I cheerfully group with. Well, sometimes not so cheerfully - damn you Moncleared for training your own group! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Kids - I wish I still was young. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Making life more difficult for other players - where did I say that? I want us to beat you to the spawns. I don't want to train you for them, I don't want to be a whiner and petition for them. I want you to zone in, and see nothing up to kill because we did it first. I want us to be the best, which will ensure you aren't. Competition is good, no?<br>

I don't irritate. I don't want to &quot;run over&quot; you. Make miserable? Well, if you don't like being number two then yes, I do want to make you miserable. But I certainly won't do it by harassing you, by training you, or by doing anything against the Everquest terms of service or play nice policy. I play hard, I play fair, I play to win.<br>

The only mistake LC could have made would have been if they'd tagged your two-faced ass, and they saw through you in time to avoid that. And I don't hold Wraith accountable for your attitude - I recognize that they'll act when you ask them to, though. Again, with emphasis: I still group with your guildmates. I wouldn't piss on you personally if you were on fire. And when I see a Wraith raid in a zone, I know any bad thing could happen because those otherwise pleasant people take their orders from people like you.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I almost feel sorry for you, who plays a game not for fun but for malice. I do feel sorry for those that have to play with you. From both guilds.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm sure you do. Just like I feel for the people that play in your guild and around you. Their reputations have been dragged through the mud by just about every guild you've come in contact with just through association, and they don't deserve it.<br>
<br>

Guess I hold myself to a higher standard. I want to be part of a guild that goes in and wins with class, which has fun and has standards. <br>
<br>
A guild that can be proud of learning the game itself, and not relying on ex-guildmates on Antonius Bayle to feed us strategies. We found out about the PoV flag by sending people through the trials. We recently figured out all the trials by sending people through them until we won. We're scouting out flag mobs by sending people to fight them, not sending people to The Safehouse to print out stuff. Like the gnome says: if we ain't dyin', we ain't tryin'!<br>
<br>
Unlike a lot of the other guilds on other servers, we actually treat other guilds with respect. You aren't going to find another Emperor-capable guild extending a rotation to guilds that haven't beaten him before. That actually leaves an area (like the Fear episode) when we find out a deal was already in place, or that we've been beaten in force. We're not the 400 pound gorilla that we could be, and it's a source of pride.<br>
<br>
We've created an atmosphere which is as casual-friendly as can be. We've always lagged behind other guilds, like Vis or Wraith, in setting standards for recruits. The only reason we put in the recent Vex Thal shard requirement was so we could actually see recruits in a raid environment! We have many players with playtimes that would get them /guildremoved in an instant by top guilds on other servers. Look at the thread on being &quot;left behind&quot; on FoH's site for an example of that.<br>

<br>
I never said they won't be critical. I trust they will paint an honest picture.<br>
<br>
Delores, you are so disillusioned it's comical. You keep referring to &quot;top guild&quot; and comments like &quot;if you are unhappy being second guild then yes i will make you miserable&quot; and then follow that up with &quot;we have a high standard&quot;. Your statements stink of hypocrisy. <br>
<br>
Wake up. Lotus isn't the top guild on the server anymore and if you think us newbies in Wraith are going to get stuck in PoP because all of us are stuck till adequate spoilers are published while the only ppl blessed with any intelligence on the server (aka Lotus Cult) can conqueor the content, you are in for a  rude awakening.<br>
<br>
I can only be flattered by your comments really. We learn and kill stuff so fast &quot;it has to be a spoiler&quot;<br>
<br>
Hahaha<br>
<br>
Anyway, we don't care for or judge by or track the performance of other guilds on Quellious. If we did then we'd never be where we are today. <br>

<br>
P.S. I find both your and ledrone's comments about the trials amusing. It's not frickin rocket science. There ARE ppl other than you who've managed to  figure it out.<br>
<br>
P.P.S. So-and-so told me that so-and-so trained them in a camp in so-and-so zone, X years ago so he must be the most horrile guy in the game............

Salta,<br>
<br>
Are you serious?<br>
<br>
Let me clue you in on a tiny insignificant thing called common sense.<br>
<br>
If one is not in a rotation, one cannot break it.    Rel and Explicit are not &quot;breaking the rotation&quot; on cursed when they try, are they?  NO!  Why?  THEY AREN&quot;T IN IT!   Duh.<br>
<br>
You may think it's fair to tell someone they can never try new content.  We don't.  I totally understand Rel and Explicit gunning for Cursed (or in the future possibly Emp)  even on &quot;my&quot; turn because they have no option but to compete FFA, or not do it, or negotiate.  If Soullance or Sephrok approached us to negotiate, we'd negotiate.  We'd tell them the current deal, and if Vis/LC agreed to let them in, we'd be all for it ... and if they decided it wasn't for them, that's fine.   If they decided the deal wasn't for them yet still wanted to try the mobs, while there might be conflict, we would not demonize them for going ffa.  We were ok with Rel joining cursed rotation four months ago, when we had just started him, before Explicit was even around.  <br>
<br>
<br>
What is it with the guilds that think they kill a mob first they own it for the rest of time?  Nobody needs your (or Wraith's) permission, nor are required to agree to your (or our) terms  to try new mobs.  <br>
<br>
When did we bitch on the boards about LC monopolizing?  <br>
<br>
We kill what we want.  We have no interest in bothering anyone else doing so.  We understand we aren't alone on the server and conflict is going to happen sometimes.  We handle it the best we can, without trying to force our terms on others.  Sometimes we back down, or the other guy backs down.  Sometimes neither does and we end up in a spat.  We try to reslove those becoming repeated with negotiation.   We understand negotiation is not &quot;my way or the highway&quot;.  <br>
<br>
<br>
We have no issues with LC as a whole.. We have had incidents with them that we disagreed on, and LC has done a few things that we felt were not very nice, but that's the game, we compete.  It's no big deal.  The most important thing is, for now at least LC still has sensible people at the helm who are willing to talk things over and be civil.  <br>
<br>
<br>
You guys (individuals not the guild) carry the chips on your shoulders... we've done nothing that your team hasn't  done, or that every fulltime raiding guild hasn't done.   The only reason we have your ire is we have the option (ie the skill and numbers)  to actually negotiate with you rather than do whatever you tell us to. <p>Gurunt Bangoo &lt;Wraith&gt;<br>
