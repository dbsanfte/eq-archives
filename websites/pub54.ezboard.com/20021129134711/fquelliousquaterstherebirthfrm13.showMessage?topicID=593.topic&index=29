I wouldn't do it.. <br>
<br>
<br>
There is only so much a parent can do to treat stuff like that and if the child doesn't want the treatment there is nothing they can do..<br>
<br>
He was 21 right? or was it 20? who says she was paying for his account? Probably when he started he was over 18 so he paided for himself and she couldn't do anything about it.. Now if you wanted to go into taking away his computer or electricity.. None of you here would do that and if you say you will you are just trying to act tough.<br>
<br>
oh and for the &quot;let him leave&quot; thing.. WTF is that? he was over 18 he can leave whenever he wants, she couldn't have stopped him if she wanted to.<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally I'd go for the overparenting arguement than the underparenting one..<br>
<br>
People keep forgetting this guy was over 18.. Most of the arguements in this thread make him sound as if he was 12 or something and his parent could just shut off his computer whenever she wanted..<br>
<br>
I know if my mom had shut off my computer I'd raise hell.<br>
<br>
If you want someone to blame.. Blame himself.. He did this to himself and he knew what he was doing. <p><center>

This guy could obviously not take care of himself.  AND if this guy was mentally competent (which is the only way he would not qualify for state help where I am from), then I still blame it on the parents.  According to social services the mother could have turned her son in and they would have gotten him help.  I actually worked in a related field for several years, so I know how the system works.  Whatever state these people are from may have different laws.<br>
<br>
As far as eating these words, I might end up doing just that.  No parents are perfect, and it is easy to stand out here and blame them.  I however have taught all of my children the difference between fantasy and reality.  My children play EQ with me and I take the time to explain it to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tolapumj wanna-be</span><br>  Posts: 904<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/21/02 6:04:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=593.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: lol biotch dont know what she asked for :P</span><hr size=1> unless I'm mistaken his mom can't go into his apartment and have social services drag him away.<br>
