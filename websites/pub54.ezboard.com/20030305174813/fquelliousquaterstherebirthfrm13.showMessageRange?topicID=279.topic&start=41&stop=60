<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Is everyone on our server going to have to start looking over their shoulder in case ADD might be comming? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We already do.  In the last 3 weeks alone, we have had at least 3 run-ins with ADD, one time we even cought one of their members listening in on a raid channel that was not password protected, which ended up costing us a Severilious kill.<br>
<br>
From the quote posted from Graffe's by Blal Oceanos<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The rule on Quellious now has gone from FFA but fair (ie if a guild is there, they got it first, even if they arent attacking it atm) to whoever pulls gets it.<br>
<br>
As you can imagine, this gets messy very quickly. Its tearing Quellious apart. And its sad. And im just as much to blame for it as everyone else, cus i want spawns too, so have to go about the same way as everyone else. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Considering the guild that Blal belongs to, and the recent occurences with them that my guild and others that have posted here have stated, I find this statement from him hypocritical to say the least.  <br>
<br>
I am not sure exactly what happened here, as I was not there, but I have always found Banelion to be an upstanding individual.  Every single time I have grouped with him, or have been a part of a raid with him, I have always left that group or raid feeling good about it.  I don't know if someone else was playing him during this fiasco, or if he has changed that much, or if the side of the story we are hearing from Tristadorn is askew, but in any case, ADD is building a fairly poor rep for themselves.  It is beginning to rival the rep that Vis used to have, when they were running roughshod over anyone and everyone.  <br>
<br>
I have several friends in ADD....Kaastle, Idias and other ex-guildies.  I hope that my views posted here do not affect our friendships, but if they do, cest la vie.<br>

<br>
i thought about this quite a bit this evening, i've spent two and a half years striving to give my main character (Maeve, the cute lil gnomie) a reputation to be proud of - regardless of the guild tag she's wearing (or not) - <br>
she'll drop just about anything at the request of a friend or even a stranger to go help them (i've been asked more times than i can count to go help someone i've never met before with an epic fight, and i almost always say yes) <br>
i've almost never put her on /anon or /role, even when i get tells from people constantly for this that or the other that a level 60 enchanter can provide, to me it's more fun to get those tells and help those people who ask than to run around not helping anyone (or to decline the offers for xp groups almost every time i log in)<br>
i don't charge for any type of tradeskill stuff be it jewelcraft or baking, i mean heck, i did the skilling up because i thought it was fun (yeah ok, i'm a nutcase) not because i thought i'd ever become rich off the endeavor<br>
<br>
i've been working on my epic on my own and with friends and guildmates since level 49 (did all the ground spawn crap and anything else i could possibly do before hitting level 50, while i slowly xp'd my way to 50) i've helped several other enchanters with the spawns, even when i didn't have that particular piece yet, knowing i had no chance to roll on the drop, just because i enjoy helping people<br>
so today when i heard that the wraith was up i was amazingly excited (ooooh, the mob for my LAST epic piece), but it was fairly early so i went in and woke Trist up and said 'Guess what?! the Wraith is up!! i just wanted to tell you, even if we probably can't get enough people to take it' he immediately got up and we started bugging everyone to log in and get their butt to Feerrott<br>
one of our guild clerics mentioned in our guildchat that ADD was also thinking about moving into Fear for the Wraith, but they weren't even in Feerrott when we started moving in to get started at 2pm (that's PDT for those who care) we expected to have some CR to do and got our resser camped out safely for that, ran everyone in, ressed the dead and started pulling roamers (still no ADD) well, you've  heard the rest of this story earlier in the thread....i won't repeat it<br>
<br>
all i can say is now i have to ask everyone who asks me for a favor (c3, haste, jewelling, whatever) for a freakin resume now ...<br>
Random_player_05 tells you: pardon me could i get c3 from you if i come to you? <br>
Maeve tells Random_player_05: excuse me, i noticed you're anon/roleplay, what guild are you in? <br>
Random_player_05 tells you: i'm in At Death's Door <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Maeve tells Random_player_05: oh...ADD, i'm sorry, i don't know you, but i can't do anything for you because you happen to be in the biggest guild of @#%$ lameass dipshits on the server, thanks, bye bye now.<br>
<br>
just sucks, you go out of your way to be a nice person for the entirety of your EQ career, and this is what you get in return...<br>
<br>
oh and as far as two of those 'Ragefire KS's' of Grimsoar's, if Grim's gonna camp Rage, why not do what we do, almost all of Radiant camps with the cleric, we do fun stuff like kill wurms and drakes and chromodracs...i guess that's how our guild 'mysteriously appeared' in Skyfire when Ragefire spawned....twice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  , because as far as i'm concerned (and this may not mean much coming from a gnome) one cleric sitting in Skyfire not doing a damn thing but sitting on his ass is not 'sufficient force' to take down Ragefire (but then ADD has never struck me as the 'helpful' type of guild)<br>

What I am saying is...for a guild to have experienced something similar, you would think they would refrain from doing what was supposedly done to them.  <br>
<br>
And I will flame (slander is doing so with cruel intention without basis) your guild anytime I wish to with the right motivation.  I don't find humor in what happened then nor do I find humor in what supposedly happened last night.  I find humor in most things but I truly hate conflict, but don't think I'd sit idly by and let the powers that be walk all over me and mine. <br>
<br>
And threatening me with retribution on a public forum is rather assinine.  What will you do, steal my dogs or spiders in Velks?  Black list me...OMG I am shivering at the thought of not being guilded?   What...follow me around and screw with every raid I'm on?  Have me banned for expressing my opinion?  Threaten to do the same to anyone who associates with me?  OMG, come to my place of employment and tell them I'm an EQ addict *gasp*.   I hope my friends would stick with me like they have always done...so do your worse hon.<br>

&quot;our guildee pulled shissar&quot;  <br>
<br>
To ADD:<br>
if this is what your being told you were lied too.  Bippity pulled the shissar your guildee pulled agro off Bippity while she was rolling it into our camp.  you can say she shouldnt have got that far away. you can make all kinds of justifications.  howver, in the end the mitigating circumstances &quot;our guildee pulled it&quot; that you find justifies you to the server wont justify you: he stole it from someone elses pull.<br>
<br>
ADD wasnt first into the zone with intent to do shissar: that was radiant.  <br>
<br>
ADD wasnt first to agro shissar: that was radiant.<br>
<br>
ADD wasnt first to specifically pull shissar out: that was radiant.<br>
<br>
So to those that justify ADD on the basis that they &quot;we were first to pull it&quot; think about it.<br>
<br>
Pala asked you point blank ADD:<br>
Will the rest of the server have to watch their backs. (paraphrased but its there)<br>
<br>
You really need to answer them. you need to do something ADD membership to get your leadership to tone down this bullshit.  ADD is collecting enemies as fast as anyone has ever done on Quellious as far as i can tell.  As for only a couple people flame us here type stuff.  true but people are murmering.  Ive had people that were helping &quot;individuals&quot; in your guild tell me &quot;I hate ADD too...&quot;  Your friends are even murmering.  people neutral are murmering.  your enemies are enraged.  And you [ADD] deserve it. every bit of it.<br>

Your a bunch of rotten bums teeth. I hate you all, I want to kill you all, I want to beat you all..  It's ashame you can't do anything on your own.  You have to listen in on others conversations.  You are a KSing guild.  oh wait, let me give you some props.. You are an *UBER KSing GUILD*  If we knew you were going for an epic piece before we decided to go for that same item, we would of gladly not even come close to you.  Bunch of punk ass losers.  You guys leave your Little Grimsoar puppet just sitting at a ragefire camp all by himself.  For 3 days not a single ADD member would even go and sit with his poor ass.  I have never hated a guild or person in this game till now.  ADD SUCKS ASS!!!   I love being a leader of a group in velks and a AT DEATHS DOOR member asks if he could be put on the list in the UD group.. &quot;What guild are you in brother&quot;?

<br>
I have a couple of friends that are in ADD, and I really hope they weren't on for that fiasco today, and if they know about it, I hope they are seriously considering a new guild, because, frankly, that behavior is both inexcusable and embarrassing.  I mean, cmon ADD, who the @#%$ do you think you are anyway?  What you did was so completely disrespectful, so blatantly rude, that regardless of the guild, or the zone or the mob you really can't in good conscience think that what you did was the right thing.  That you were deserving, that you had some right to it.  A guild beat you to the zone to kill the mob, and that should have been all there was to it.  You come back another day.  You don't go into the zone THEY broke, that THEY suffered the cr's for, that THEY lost time and exp for, that THEY cleared the path to the mob they needed to kill, and then take their mob.  That should NEVER be an issue, that kind of @#%$ shouldn't even be tossed around as an idea by sensible people.  <br>
<br>
I am floored by the piss-poor lack of judgement shown by ADD leadership today, by their arrogance, and their lack of respect for others.  And I am also terribly sorry that Maeve had to be victim to such asinine attitudes.  I am so sorry, Maeve.  Had I had any idea that this would have happened, I would have brought all of DB out of Chardok to your aid.  You are one of the most deserving people on our server for an epic, and you had to deal with this BS.<br>
<br>
I don't like to flame, in fact, I think this is my first post on this board.  But I will stand up for people who are wronged, particularly my friends who are being walked on by a bunch of punks who think they are better then everyone else.  ADD was WAY out of line.  I invite ADD members to take a good hard look at themselves, and the actions of their guild this day.  Are you proud of that @#%$?  Are you, REALLY?<br>

It appears certain members of ADD appear to be suffering from a &quot;God-complex&quot; delusion.<br>
<br>
As a matter of common courtesy, ADD, since you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   KNEW</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Radiant was clearing to the Shissar, you should have offered to help, or simply bug out of the zone.  Instead you stooped to the lowest level and simply waited till they had done all the hard work, then engaged and KS'd the mob after it had been pulled by Radiant.<br>

Tacky, very very tacky....<br>

<br>
Radiant had been clearing around the temple for about an hour and we were ready to pull about 5 min after ADD finishes zoning in.  Our plan was to have Tristadorn run in with DA and agro the entire temple, and run it all out into NWC to kite while me or Eadric got the shissir.  <br>
<br>
We went as planned, Trist pulled out most of the temple, but as anyone who has pulled it before would know, it is hard to get *everything* out.  Therefore, when Ead went in, he got alot of agro and kited those out - which is when I ran in.<br>
<br>
As I was running around the temple base from the western side to the eastern side, I saw Verbo, who must have had sow or  run3 on - I had SoE, which is quite a bit faster.  I ran up the ramp and into the small room at the top of the temple.  Inside were the Shissir (unagro) and at least one cube.  I ran up to the shissir and hit it once with autoattack, then backed out of the temple to avoid having my soe dispelled by the cube.  I noticed that the Shissir wasnt coming out of the hut like it should - so I cast a snare spell on it asap, but it was too late for that since I can only guess that Verbo already had the agro.  For those doubting if I agroed it first (while people from my raid made the pull possible at all, I remind you), here is the log of me engaging...<br>
<br>
<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:35 2002] Auto attack is on.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:35 2002] You appear.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:36 2002] You try to slash Wraith of a Shissir, but miss!<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:36 2002] Wraith of a Shissir hits YOU for 233 points of damage.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:36 2002] Wraith of a Shissir hits YOU for 120 points of damage.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:36 2002] Auto attack is off.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:36 2002] Wraith of a Shissir tries to kick YOU, but YOU dodge!<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:37 2002] Caladur tells Radiant:3, 'Remedy on &lt;( Maeve )&gt;'<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:37 2002] Wraith of a Shissir begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:37 2002] You resist the Stone Breath spell!<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:38 2002] Famodil tells the group, 'two in camp '<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:38 2002] Kuluvien tells Radiant:3, 'assisting shaddai'<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:42 2002] Reynic tells FERecruits:4, 'lol, I gotta ask Desj when she started on Morrel'<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:42 2002] You begin casting Tangling Weeds.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:43 2002] Your target resisted the Tangling Weeds spell.<br>
<br>
<br>
Notice that I only hit it once and got agro, notice that it exicuted a full round of attacks (hit+hit+kick+stun) all at once - it would not have done this is Verbo had already engaged the mob, the rounds would have been broken up somewhat.<br>
<br>
<br>
That is my proof that we engaged the mob first, not to mention made the pull possible.<br>

Don't forget to metion that if a monk had aggro on it, I can assure you that it would not have turned around to take 4 swipes at a druid that is trying to melee.  Not with 175 1hs skill and 175 offense.  <br>
<br>
Now way in a million years is one swipe from a druid, gonna draw that kind of aggro from a ANY class that has already gained aggro on it.  <br>
<br>
This is all I need to see.  ADD was wrong, they are mistaken if they think they pulled the mob first, and if they contest this evidence, then I condemn them as a callous bunch of kill-stealers. <p><center><a target="new"href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30880">Rhes Olooshun - 58th Preserver</a></center>

You and your alliances can suck balls, especially you Tristadorn. How easy it is to forget that after that Ragefire incident, when you and Shaekee went to turn in your epic piece for her click stick, that there was a failed Fay spawn there and he killed you both.<br>
Not knowing if it was the real Fay or not, a bunch of us went out there to see and soon learned it was from somebodys failed Fay raid. Then we rezzed you and your cleric i believe without so much of a hard feeling toward the incident the night before.<br>
Now I am not looking for any merit badges regarding this incident or even a thank you which I never recieved from you fuckface, but it goes to show you how one person can be all one sided.<br>
Dont worry folks ADD will stick to their own, and I already try to work with as many guilds as possible, but quite frankly the only reason why we have this supposed bad reputation is because handjobs like you whine and scream tlll you are blue in the face about the unfairness of things. <br>
I used to be a nice guy until Verant forced us to play by their rules, so screw you Trist, and go to hell.<br>
<br>
Also, not knowing much about you Rhes I just want to pull a little quote from one of your replies to this post:<br>
<br>
&quot;ADD is building a fairly poor rep for themselves. It is beginning to rival the rep that Vis used to have, when they were running roughshod over anyone and everyone.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah they used to do this, until I realized to stop bitching and complaining about it because they too in fact were using Verants Rules. So instead of kicking and fussing we went out and started to try and change this. We have working relationships with a few guilds even now, as well as having the ability to take on more and more of the high level mobs in the game. We get stronger each day. So please dont try to assume that what all you fuckfaces type on this shitboard to be the absolute gospel for &quot;our&quot; Server for which &quot;we&quot; all pay for, but rather make your own assessments be they good or bad, I care not.<br>
<br>
Now all you shitbirds can flame me all you want I care not, I am a man and I can take it, so piss off.<br>
<br>
***Hey, this is my first real flame on this board where I really flame folks, I am learning this game well I guess, thanks for really opening my eyes and changing me from the used to be caring person, to just another @#%$ on the Quellious Server.

<br>
I recall a thread that Raluvin had started here a while back, that was concerning the rules that Verant have, and the rules of decency that we try to use to govern ourselves.  It has been shown time and time again, that most of the time, when a group or guild of players decide to do something that is not normally within the realm of good player ethics, they will whip out the Verant rule card, and try to claim that it is not against the rules.  <br>
<br>
It is a sad day when a group or guild of people, feels the need to run in and take something from someone else, that they had worked and waited so long for.  <br>
<br>
Put yourselves in Maeve's shoes.  Have some empathy.  <br>

If a guild was going with intent to kill one specific mob and they had to clear to get him that mob was theirs at least to try. That is where you broke the rule in the fact you just ran your raid over them after they spent the time to clear. GMs would say that you must let them have one chance at the mob and if they fail you could pick up where they left off. What you guys did was just shitty to be honest.

Too many instances as of late for this to be considered BS.  It puts individuals under a lot of pressure both in ADD and outside of ADD.  <br>
<br>
Whilst I did wear the ADD tag whilst I was away playing DaoC (BOO!), I have maintained good relationships throughout.  Banelion was the only person playing me during this time.<br>
<br>
Tristadorn, I know has ALWAYS had a bad reputation (sometimes it got a little personal with people).  I wouldnt comment on specifics because that it is not my way.  <br>
<br>
I can however support Banelion.  He has been my most loyal friend for 2 1/2 years ... I would defend him until I was blue in the face.  <br>
<br>
He has, like me helped the smallest people to the largest guilds in several ways ... I will not have a bad word said about him.  <br>
<br>
Although I know the situation is on reflection, wrong, I agree ADD should have never entered PoF in the first place ... there has gotta be more to this than meets the eye.  <br>

This is a very neutral post as you will see.  I dont like guilds at each others throats or people in general, so I am hoping that some sort of solution can be found. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ubrazininkogneetoe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brazin Inkogneetoe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/12/02 9:05:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ADD - You wanted a war, you got a war.</span><hr size=1> &quot;...Put yourselves in Maeve's shoes.

<br>
<br>
Maybe we should all use this same quote and put Grim's name in there.  Losing Rage EIGHT times and all losses were within the &quot;rules&quot;.  Try having some empathy for him and all the long camps he has endured.<br>
<br>
Seems to me the problem is not so much with what happened in Fear nor with Rage, as it is a problem with the way Verant applies the rules of PnP and the way we, as the EQ community, accept them and USE them to our advantage.<br>
<br>
When the ridiculous PnP rules are applied in a given situation and a guild or player gets screwed over because of it, how can you blame them for choosing to start applying those SAME rules in their favor?  <br>
<br>
What I am trying to say is that when a player or guild has tried to play &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;honorable&quot; (as defined by the general community) only to be screwed over by other players and/or guilds that petition or otherwise apply the PnP, the time finally comes that they say &quot;@#%$ it&quot;.  Their feeling becomes one of &quot;Why should we play fair when others use our fairness against us&quot;?  They finally get pushed to the point where they decide that the only &quot;fair&quot; way to play, is the way that falls within the PnP enforced by Verant.  It may not be &quot;fair&quot; as defined by the community, but it is the ONLY LEGALLY ENFORCED policy of how to play &quot;fair&quot;. <br>
<br>
So you can call it what you want, but if you want to lay blame, lay blame on yourselves (meaning all of us in EQ) and on Verant, for enforcing a PnP that does not equalize with generally accepted community morales.  If you've ever applied the PnP to force an issue in your favor, then you are as guilty or innocent as anyone involved in this situation.<br>
<br>
Finally, I have to comment on Bips post regarding his pull.  Based on your own comments and your log as posted, you were not in visual contact with the mob, nor with Verbo when he engaged.  Isn't it likely that Verbo didn't know you had hit the mob, because you weren't within Verbo's, nor the Mob's, sight when Verbo engaged?  I'm not giving excuses and I'm not making judgement.  I'm only saying that from the evidence presented, it does not appear to me that Verbo &quot;stole&quot; aggro from you.  How could he have known you had hit the mob when you weren't within his (and the mob's) sight when he engaged it?  <br>
<br>
None of this really matters though, because until Verant changes the PnP to utilize and apply generally accepted community morales, then the only way to play &quot;fair&quot; is to play strictly within those PnP rules we currently have. <br>
