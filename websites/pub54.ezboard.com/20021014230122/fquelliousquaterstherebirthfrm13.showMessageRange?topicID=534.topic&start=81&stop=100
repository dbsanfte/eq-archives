I WAS NOT there for the cazel thing... I was for the hate thing, yah, big train 20+ mobs is not exaggerating but we took care of it... a few deaths, not much harm done. Still I do know the history that we've had with UP hasn't been all that great starting a few months ago. However, Trist was absolutely right regarding how selfless and upstanding the people in this guild are. The attitudes of my guildies are just amazing, they get discouraged, upset, angry just like anyone else... but they know how to deal with it, and they absolutely would go out of the way for other people. I'm sorry this turned into a sort of grudge match. Also, we don't come without conscience, I know that a few people feel VERY bad for causing such an argument and would rather just give up the spoon or help out another time than continue an argument like this. Be mindful of what you say, there isn't a bad bone in this guild. Good ole Radiant.<br>

As for all the clueless morons coming here saying Radiant has a bad rep.. i really can't see anyone taking them seriously.  Until this weekend with UP, I cannot remember ANY time since ADD that we butted heads with another guild or behaved questionably in anyway.   I'm an officer and co-founder of the guild, and i never ever recieve complaints about the behavior of our members.  We generally get along very well with our fellow Quellious players, not only avoiding conflict but often going out of our way to help them.  Personally i'm very proud of my guild for this.. i'm not always the most helpful or friendly person myself, but i can say that my guildmates never cease to amaze and inspire me to be nicer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I also am sorry you guys have to be grouped along the likes of Ulwern and Cyphon. It's a shame really.<br>
<br>
When someone starts a flame and intends to come here and slander someone else, in my eyes thats just in bad taste anyway. As I stated, I only wanted to read the post at first, but was named in the fray so I decided to defend myself, my reputation, and my name. Cazel will pop again, and Hate will fully respawn again and again and again, no matter who clears it however many times or wipes out. It's that simple. It's only a game. I won't make much of a comment on the Cyphon posts, only that if you want to come here and post about someone else being an idiot, you can do it without using &quot;u&quot;, unfinished sentences, and attempted uber speak. <br>
<br>
I may be an idiot, but I do a sure good job of hiding it.<br>

I was actually referring to our actions in game in above quote, but i'm sure the concept of misquoting and taking things out of context would be lost on you.  just in case it's not and you have an ounce of intelligence inside that super think caveman skull, i'll spell it out for you.  My guildmates are upstanding players in the game Everquest on the server Quellious.  We get along with nearly everyone nearly all the time.  People who we know won't play nice, we avoid.  How these guildmates respond to false accusations and slander on a message board has no relation whatsoever to this quote.<br>
<br>
Charlatan?  &quot;A person who makes elaborate, fraudulent, and often voluble claims to skill or knowledge; a quack or fraud.&quot;  I've been called a lot of bad things, and some of them were no doubt true, but this is the most ridiculously inaccurate thing someone has ever called me.   It seems to me that you are an illiterate, ignorant, rude, and simple minded little person who needs to keep his piece of shit labels to himself. <br>
<br>
In case I need to clarify all this into terms you can clearly understand - go fuck yourself.<br>

Keep agro on chanter while she runs around and has paly bash from behind.  Why do this?  Cause there are no healers for the paly.  Makes sense to me.<br>
<br>
I can tell you this though..  I have been guilded with Tristadorn before.  I helped him fighting ADD about Ragefire to get Shaekee her epic (which is a good cause in my book anyday to fight ADD).  I wont say any details, but Trist is prettymuch a baby.  He whines when he doesnt get what he wants and asks everything of everyone (at least he did when I was with him).  I keep finding reason to get to like him again after he pulls some bad chit, but then I go to the message board and find another new flame about Trist or Radient.  It never fails.  Bottom line:  Trist is an ass.  He can get you to love him and follow him, and pull jackass chit like this on other people and not think twice about doing it.  Then you find yourself devending your actions.  Its horrible.  Sorta like Hitler, or Usama, or Arafat, or Sadam..<br>
<br>
This was a blatient KS and he knows it.  Hell, I think someone should get on their message board, find out when they are going to raid something, then go KS them and say that they were in the right.<br>
<br>

<br>
By the way, I am tired so sorry if this doesnt may any sense what so ever.<br>

This is what you are missing Cyphon.  I'm not discussing the Cazel incident - i wasn't there, i don't know details.  i'm correcting those who are coming here saying that Radiant has a bad rep and we run over people all the time.  This is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> true in any way, shape, or form.  If it ever became true myself and others would see it corrected.  I'm sorry you have trouble reading.  my posts were, i believe, fairly clear and coherent, and you took everything out of context and twisted my words to label me a &quot;Charlatan.&quot;  If I had a bad opinion of you from your initial posts here, that bad impression has been compounded ten times by all of this bullshit.<br>

What the Fuck does that mean?  I know I don't mean to sound Australian when I say Oy.  The oy I use comes from yiddish (an amalgamation of hebrew, russian, german, and others, for those of you who don't know shit) and is an exclamation, similar to 'woah' in english.<br>
<br>
And Stehe?  Don't fucking get me started on your comparison of Trist you little list of infamous guys. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=98874">Slyse Muleflayer</a><br>

I'm only going to say, get bent. If that's the opinion you've formed of Trist, I'd say it speaks a great deal more about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> your</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> character than it does about his.<br>
<br>
Trist is, to put it mildly, a great guy. Comparing him to Hitler, Osama, Saddam, or Arafat, is so far out of line that it's almost back on it.<br>

That's why I never stated your name that you were trying to lag us all out.  I was being nice about it, then I called you &quot;Ebayed&quot; not &quot;n00b&quot;.  I have never had any hardships on Quellious, or any other server for that matter.  I found a guild that is awesome and cares for everyone on the server.  Which is &quot;Radiant&quot;.  <br>
<br>
I'm not going to flame you Cyphon.  The reason is cause we are all real people, I'm sure in RL everyone is a nice person or whatever.  I wish you all best of luck and even you Cyphon.  I hope you learn to be nice to people.  Me saying you were Ebayed was to get you to stop lagging people. &quot;Which is worked&quot;  Then you try to Duel me before porting up to Hate &quot;How am I going to Duel right before porting up?&quot;  Slow down a raid to just duel out of anger?  That's just rude.<br>
<br>
I told Raehn I would help camp for UP's chanter or whatever her desicion.  I hope both our chanters get thier epics..<br>

<br>
I was at the Vindi kill.  <br>
<br>
First wipe, most were pretty much clueless as to what was going to happen, and when it did happen, they froze.<br>
<br>
Second wipe, prior to me getting beat like a red-headed step-child, things went 100000000% better, down to 20% sounds right.. most everyone died, and the casters pets were attempting to finish Vindi off.<br>
<br>
Third attept, Vindi dead... and what 2 deaths?<br>
<br>
Mind you, all this with about 32 people.<br>
<br>
I was there for only faction hits with my cleric, and I was genuinely impressed at the attitudes of the members of Radiant after the second wipe.<br>
<br>
Ironically enough, I got no faction hits... go figure.<br>
<br>
I have only had very limited interaction with Radiant, aside from this instance, and none that I can recall from UP. <br>
<br>
So... take my opinion with the grain of salt that it is.<br>
<br>
(edit).. Thanks for letting me attempt to get the factin hit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804>Impudent Blasphemy</a><BR>

WOOT!!!<br>
<br>
In all seriousness and acknowledging this thread as a neutral third party.<br>
<br>
I have grouped with some members of Radiant in the past and they seem like good people.  All except that Vaghris character.  I heard he likes to hump farm animals.<br>
<br>
Otherwise there was times in Kael and Fear where I was on a raid and Radiant came in and aided us in taking down whatever uber mob we were going after.  I am not too familiar with UP or of the bad blood between the 2 guilds.  But may I suggest in the future that if this happens again, that the guilds could join up and help each other instead of letting peoples names being dragged thru the mud.   My 2cp.<br>
