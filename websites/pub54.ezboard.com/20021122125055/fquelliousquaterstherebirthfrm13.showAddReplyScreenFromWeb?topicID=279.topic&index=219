seems that everyone keeps contesting who had agro first.. and who's kill it rightfully was.<br>
<br>
1) If the mob was NOT in his/her place, someone OBVIOUSLY had agro.. they said the mobs in the temple were static.. well, if it's not in it's spot, *someone* has agro.<br>
<br>
2) The KSing policy states that if a mob is engaging *or persuing* a player, then it is considered engaged. There ya go. it was following him, even if at a distance due to speed, ergo it was his pull. No one should have moved in on it.<br>

<br>
I have read this shiot over and over trying to make reasoning out of the blabble. BUT DAMN this is getting stupid. Same reason I turn ooc and shouts off in game.<br>
<br>
Now everyone in this game has had a bad experience with someone/folks.....hense the someONE or some FOLKS. Shiot I had a prob with SOME FOLKS in Karnor's a while back. All of them in the same guild 'cept for a few others in another guild. And yeah when I did a who all on the guilds they was the only ones online at that time and I B#tch fested them. BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I DO NOT hold thier actions against the others in that guild that I have had the pleasure of meeting. INSTEAD ........ I wrote the names in my BLACK LIST book and may the gods of Everquest help them if they need help badly and I am the only option&lt;only xlocer in hate/fear/bad areas you cant get out without one&gt; I hope and pray you have one hefty @$$ bank account.Even at that I still would probly say well damn guess you should have watched what mud holes you played in earlier in game and leave your @$$ sittin there. <br>
<br>
But now lets say your guildie logs in and they arent in my book and need an xloc out/help whathave you. OF COURSE I WILL!!! You have never done anything offensive to me or my comrades&lt;guild or not&gt; so of course I will help you in any way i can. <br>
<br>
Now I know a few folks in ADD and they are some awesome folks&lt;I know for a fact they wasn't there that day&gt;. I know folks in a plenty guilds where one or a few of their guildies have really peeved me off. But I WILL NOT blast those I know to be awesome people/players in said guild.Or those that I don't know at all even.<br>
<br>
Now those ADD's that were in fear that day YEAH you are wrong. I mean come on... if you had broke in and killed all that crap off and had the massive CR's and had already told folks this is why we are here and someone came in and took what you was there for away from you you would be the flamers. I know I would. It is just plain and simple as this ...... MORALS. Just because some VAIGE rule states and makes it so called ok in GAME does not mean it is right. Manson thought he was right too. So did 'ol dude in Wacko. But where they ? 99 percent of humanity said they wasn't. So therefore they in everyone's eyes where wrong. This is what everyone is so peeved about. Not this that or the other thats been getting knocked back and forth here in this board. The only thing I can see from the boards that peeved folks off was the fact that YOUR RAID LEADER KNEW that the SHIZZAR was ALREADY being cleared to for MAEVE BEFORE you all entered.NOW maybe he didnt tell you . Maybe he said &quot;They knew we was coming here so they came here b4 we could get here.&quot; But clearly this was NOT the case. YOUR raid leader KNEW FULL WELL that others were ALREADY in FEAR AND CLEARING TO GET TO THE SHIZZ BEFORE he organized everyone and went in. BOTTOM LINE.<br>
<br>
LET IT GO. There is no way in hell that MORALLY you can justify that. <br>
<br>
Verant can make all the rules they want but WE are what makes our server. NOT VERANT. If we want a loving community by george WE CAN HAVE IT!!!! No rule says we can't. No rule say's we HAVE to fight bicker and mame. WE THE PLAYERS is what makes Quellious good or bad. Me personally I want a good server something I can log in and  feel relieved of the RL preassures from the day . <br>
<br>
WE CAN HAVE A GREAT COMMUNITY/SERVER . IT IS UP TO US AND US ALONE. <br>
<br>
You know what if everyone that played EQ went on strike Verant would bend over backwards to make shiot the way WE THE CONSUMER WANT IT.<br>
<br>
I have never ever posted on this board b4. Maeve has been a comrade of mine since 2000. I have others I have been <br>
comrades with since Feb this year but I would stand up for them as well just like I would Maeve. Even if I didn't know you at all I would come to your aid if you needed me to. But NOT if you are in my BOOK. I would help you even if one or 20 of your guildies was in my book cause you arent in the book. This way &lt;hopefully&gt; those lowly few that aren't even good enough to scrub my toilets with thier tongue's may leave Quellious and never come back. But that's a big dream I know . But Oh well at least there is no way in hell they ever gonna bother me. I just ignore thier @$$'s. Problem solved. So if we as a comunity stick together and keep on being our nice loving caring selves and just flat ignore&lt;as if they dont even exist&gt; those careless thoughtless unfeeling folks out there that maybe they will just get sick of it and leave.<br>
<br>
Summerized........ The folks in Fear that day that took that spawn ARE WRONG PERIOD. I am sure that not all of ADD was there that day therefore I would never flame anyone that wasnt even there . It just wouldn't be fair to those that didn't uphold the low lives. SOOOO ....<br>
<br>
&lt;replacing the ADD thing thats been rabid on the board&gt; YOU LOWLY FOLKS THAT WENT IN FEAR KNOWING SOMEONE WAS ALREADY THERE FOR THE SAID NPC ........ GET STUCK NEEDING ME OR SOMEONE ELSE YOU PEEVED OFF WITH YOUR ACTIONS&gt; I just hope I am there to see it.<br>
<br>
And Qin ...... /e smile. You are truely someone that was a victim of sort as well. Sorry you had to go thro that BS cause of a few dumb@$$es. I forgot to mention it b4 I ranted the joker that caused the fiasco. *huggles* and /bonks Allissiya. <br>

One group can go into fear and clear it. <br>
<br>
Why were there so many in Fear the following days/times? Cause folks got peeved that is why . AND alot of folks that posted to attend the raid for said weekend could not make it till friday day/eve at best. <br>
<br>
I lknow a many of folks that go in fear and exp group &lt;6 folks max&gt; all the time. Shoot there is a 60 cleric that camps in there and solo's. Bards can solo fear if camped inside prior. So yes 2 groups could more than likely clear zone if of sufficiant levels. Shoot seen 2 groups in WW all the time exp'ing on the iceburrowers and they are level 60 mobs. Just as I have seen 8 players take out the VS spawn. <br>
<br>
And from personal exp. I sat in Kedge for hours on top of hours waiting on Phinny .... he pops I have like 4 people. Folks come in they want Phinny ... they respectfully asked me if I was getting more to come ... I honestly told them no they arent even online yet. They said well can we kill him? I said might as well . No problems. I had other instances where they<br>
came in had full force and thier scout told them I was there since the early morning &lt;4 am MST&gt; and it was I would say 2 PM MST. They asked if I was camping him I said yes but I dont have anyone yet to come and they left. I even told them go ahead noone is online that I know . They said no you been there forever no. What i am getting at is this ........... If someone is in a zone i dont care how long I sat there waiting on it to pop and they have enough folks there to kill it I will by all rights Help them kill it and just sit there and wait again to see if I may get the chance to get my NPC next time. I have kiled VS more times than I can count &lt; last item I need BTW &gt; and wouldnt even ask to roll for it and if asked if I wanted to said no. WHY?? Cause they was there with the folks to kill it first. So what if i sat there for 4 months waiting on my chance to be there when it spawned first. I did not have folks there to take it. So therefore it is not my place to gripe or complain nor even ask to roll. <br>
<br>
I can hear the words of &quot;opinions are like assholes ...&quot; And your right. This is only my opinion and therefore this is how I run my EQ life. Does this mean i lack ubber gear ? YES. Does this mean I have waited over a year for my epic after I have started it ? Yes. Does this mean I care if I have or not ? Yes. I aint saying it feels good to sit there all that time just to not get the item cause it doesnt . I am just saying that Why would I think I woud have any right to it merly because I sat there for days waiting . I was there but they had force and was there first . Not my NPC anymore. Is theirs. One day maybe I will get asked to go help a wizzy get theirs and it be they just wanted me there so i could get it since I helped them whenever I was in the zone. Ya never know. But I do know one thing..... I have WAY LESS enemies than I do comrades. Maybe 5 percent of the folks I have encountered have ended up being folks I just dont care for and more than likely the feeling is mutual. And the other 95 percent I have meet have been pleasant to meet and some have become really good friends. <br>
<br>
When things like this happen it makes the game not so fun and makes getting your epic &lt; since that is what the topic pertains to&gt; even less fun. When I get my item for my epic I wanna party i wanna have fun I wanna hear cheers. Not this.Hense that is why I live my EQ life the way I do. <br>
<br>
And I am sorry if anyone falls onto anyone's black list but I firmly believe that folks get that by their own actions. Not cause someone else caused it.So like I said b4 if you on list you on list. No skin off anyones nose. What does the person that got on list care anyhoo? Obviously when they got on the list to begin with they wasnt too worried about it.<br>
<br>
The only time I camped something and got peeved off was that day in Karnor's. I had force was there and had been there clearing while another bunch was at zone in gathering. They rushed past me and mine and rushed VS room and after our camped cleric rezzed thiers and everyone got back up and buffed i was under an impression of lets just help each other. Even tho i was there and had force i was willing why not lets have fun . I cant stand bitching. But to rush past us when you knew we was already there andin force and take that NPC was wrong IN MY EYES. And a buncha others from the flood of tell's I recieved . Those folks got on alot of lists that night. And of course they probly blame it on me. i don't rightly care if they do. I know cause of what they did is why they are on those lists.<br>
