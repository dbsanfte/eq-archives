<br>
Alle was booted for conduct unbecoming an LM member, and SHE chose to post here.  She addressed me directly, and I responded.  The flames that she was slammed with werent even from LM members, but yeah... most were ex-LM members (members who were driven out of the guild by her whining).<br>
<br>
She put her own neck on the block folks... all we did was not get in the way of the axe falling for once.<br>
<br>
She's a grown woman, and needs to learn someday to be responsible for her actions... and that &quot;I'm sorry&quot; only works so many times before people stop believing you when you say it.<br>
<br>
And while we're at it, and on the topic of responsible for actions....<br>
<br>
Fandrell....<br>
<br>
For those who dont know, Fandrell Trueshot is actually Keif Vileweaver.  He's recently taken over the board identity of Fandrell in an attempt to leech the good name of the original &quot;Scumbag Ranger&quot; (miss ya bro), since as Keif, his name is shot to hell... and basically cant buy himself into a guild anymore.  If you doubt this, try talking to people in AoA, LM, Vis, Wraith, and I'm sure you'll be more than entertained with his exploits.<br>
<br>
And yes... Fandrell was also just recently removed from Lor Mani for being a selfish whore.  Should we start posting publicly how you threw hissy fits in guild chat and on the boards when you werent able to get Epic help for your levl 40 BM?  Level 40 folks.  Thas right!<br>
<br>
And Craig... I'm gonna say this once... and once only... and quite openly...<br>
<br>
Tread really damn softly if you wanna go toe to toe with me.<br>
<br>
I know what you've said, who you've said it to, and how you've tried to twist my words to make me out to be a really shitty human being.<br>
<br>
You wanna start a flame, go right ahead... because I have way more than enough ammunition to put you right the hell where you belong.<br>
<br>
It's kinda funny how even though I dont keep logs of ICQ and in-game chats, other do... and if you wish... throw out what you got bro.  Show it to everyone.... and I'll do the same.  When I'm done with yer sorry lieing ass, you wont be able to get a KC group, much less an invite into LC.<br>
<br>
Cause unlike you, I stand by what I say and have said.  I do so with honor and without shame.  You want to post these &quot;incriminating logs&quot;, go right ahead bro.  Personally, I'd love to see them.<br>
<br>
And make damn sure your first shot is as true as the namesake you're hiding behind, cause I will bury you when I take mine.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day <p><center>

You want to talk and be straight with me you can. If you want to flame me you are more than welcome to do so.<br>
 <br>
I hide behind no names, the mention of other guilds in this post is uneccasry. I make sure every knows I am not the original Fandrell.  I still have good relationships with the leaders of such guilds and unless they say anything differntly then I assume it is that way.<br>
  <br>
 As for me being a selfish bastard? You know as well as I do that is far from the truth.<br>
 <br>
 As for the issue with my Beast Lord, I did ask for help because it was attainable, when I learned that the officers did not want to help me, I did not push the issue. I was 45 at the time.<br>
  <br>
  My time with LM was ending anyway, I did nothing but help people and continue to do so. People have known me in one form or another for a long time, if they want to join you in bashing me then have at it.<br>
 <br>
 I will refrain from bashing you or LM in anyway. I did not bring this up in public and will not do so. If you do want to talk to me you know good and well how to get in touch with me.<br>
 <br>
 Jeff, you know as well as I do,that I have been nothing but good to you and your family. This attack on me was unfounded and unwarranted. This is a guild issue with LM and needs to stay there. Since I am no longer a member of Lor Mani, then I have no desire to be a part of the problems that have been created lately. I have had my discussions with the officers and said what needed to be said. If you want any further discusions then we can have them. As I told you this morning, I wish you the best of luck in whatever you do.<br>
<br>
Craig<br>
<br>
P.S. For those of you in VM, I spent a couple of weeks with you about a year ago and was unable to commit the time that was neccassary.

Vague, yet eloquent... and twisted about as bad as you twist everything.<br>

I was more than happy when the officers decided that you had to be booted to just let it be.<br>
<br>
But when we lost Soddy to your blatant lies... lies about things that I said... it became personal.<br>
<br>
Oh... and I love how you say that when you didnt get Epic help for your BL, that you just let it drop.  Truth is that you got petty and whined at every opportunity with little digs here and there.  Wanna see my favorite?<br>

<br>
And as far as helping people... name a single time you helped anyone when you werent in position for personal gain.  <br>

Smoke coming out yer ears yet?<br>
<br>
Back to Sodina.  I hope yer happy bro.  I got tells last night from a very confused woman... someone who'd been told so much crap that she didnt know what to believe anymore.  A woman who is detagged and in self-exile just so she can think straight.... and why?  I'll tell you why... cause you fed her a great line of bullshit that I was some Nazi dictator that was gonna snipe anyone that didnt see things my way.  And then you followed it up saying that you have logs to prove it all.<br>
<br>
Nice twist on my words... hope yer happy.<br>
<br>
Now... the truth.  I told you in no uncertain terms that LM in in the middle of a bad time (these things happen).  I stepped down as GL, and whining people like yourself and Alle and been a cancer to our guild... and a cancer that we were determined to remove at all costs.  And if removing you cost us others as well... then that's still a price worth paying to get our family back.... a family that people like YOU damn near destroyed.<br>
<br>
The cancer has been removed, and LM will heal over time... and be stronger in the end.<br>
<br>
But whatever happens... I will not forget what you did.<br>
<br>
To hell with you! <p><center>

<br>
 Lets go one step further, how many raids did I lead, so that the guild got armor upgrades and resist gems. hey better yet? How many peices of armor did I MQ with you and other guildies?  Weren't you the first member of the guild to have a full set of quest armor and mainly from MQing with you?<br>
<br>
 I have been a member of Lor Mani for longer than you have and yes you do have a dictatorship like attitude. There is more to this then what people are seeing and I REFUSE to bring it up. It is a waste of energy, I told you last week when you did what you did, I was done with it. I just posted here to let things drop and you attacked me? The advice was for Alle and not yourself.<br>
 <br>
 We have had this discussion more than once, the game is just a few pixels and no sense in letting it stress people the way it does. You want to talk to me you can, I was just as pissed as you were to see Sodina leave LM.<br>

As always... the sinister little digs and ominous statements.  You leap on your &quot;high road&quot;, and then &quot;slip&quot; little statements like that.... which all but beg people to ask you &quot;tell me.  tell me&quot;.  And when they do, you let slip little bits of hearsay, all the while saying that you dont wanna get involved... yet you always have &quot;logs&quot; and proof, bla bla bla.<br>
<br>
You're involved now, and I'm calling you out.<br>
<br>
What's this &quot;rest of the story&quot;?  Please Craig.... enlighten the masses.  Is this the story of Quas and Autty's secret plot to do away with you and take over the guild?  Or is it maybe that you're trying to cover up the fact that you lie, and are a self-serving loot whore.<br>
<br>
Want specifics?  You asked for it.<br>
<br>
You ran raids?  Yep... raids where you got dops.  Nothing wrong with that... but what about that which you left unsaid?  What about the fact that the only groups that regularly got XP were the groups you were in?  Loot?  You looted the corpses, and never had the split on... and since you pulled as a Ranger and SK, dont use monks as an excuse.  That money was never distributed.  <br>
<br>
Do I have proof?  Damn straight I do.  Talk to Autumnwyld.... who lived in Kael with you.  What about those droppable loot items that never found homes (nothing major... but things like Journeymans Walking sticks... thing that always wound up on YOUR twinks... or sold in EC)?<br>
<br>
Speaking of EC, how about that time you gave Crumm all those spells to sell... you remember.... the ones from the AoA raid?  Spells that werent yours to sell... so you give them to an unknowing Crumm to do it for you.  Thanks Autty for that story.<br>
<br>
What about the Blue Diamonds from PoG?  You tell me the other day that you had TWO full stacks of them... two stacks that were never given to the people who earned them on your raids.<br>
<br>
Want a more recent example?<br>
<br>
We took out the Fear Golems one night... and a Shammy staff dropped.  Guess who looted it?  Guess who still has it?  Slither your way out of it if you can... but you dug yourself a hole yer not getting out of this time.<br>
<br>
And as far as talking Sodina out of stuff?  Nice one... especially considering the fact that no one would have had to talk her out of anything had you not slipped her your half-truths and outright lies.<br>
<br>
She told me exactly what you told her... so sorry... but your story isnt holding water.<br>
<br>
But please... keep trying to take the high road, and keep with your little &quot;people dont know the whole story&quot;... and when you do, I'm gonna keep throwing out examples to the otherwise.<br>
<br>
You can say what you want about me, to whomever you think will listen... but when you hurt those who I care about... I'm gonna be all over you.  And once last thing about Sodina... answer me this... if I considered her as nothing more than some castaway toy or whatever... then tell me why I got together with Autty, Syllie, and Uggmugg to pool together 40k (20+ of which was my own money) to suprise her with C3?<br>
<br>
And asked for nothing in return... well... except that she take the 40k she was going to spend herself to help out others... or hell... go buy herself some new toys.... cause she more than deserves them. <p><center>

Ask your brother about all the BD's I gave him for resist gear? I know for a fact I gave him tons of them for the guild.(well tons might be an exxageration, but I do know stacks would fit the bill)<br>
<br>
As far as AOA goes, all the spells were given to them, the ones Crumm sold were his own. This was all settled with Gypsum and AOA.<br>
<br>
As far as the staff goes, I probably have the damn thing stuffed in the bank. I remember giving the Shield to Erzinen,but forgot about the staff, hell you know all you had to was ask me about it, instead of trying to accuse me of something that isnt true. You know for a fact your talking crap here. I dont even know what the stupid thing is.<br>
<br>
Yeah, let me see here I led tons of POA raids and handed out the gems immediatley afterwards or chased people down to get them their share. So I had no right to keep a BD here and there? Plus I was still handing them out to whoever asked.<br>
<br>
BTW on most of the Kael farming, Montyy beat me to the loot 90% of the time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Man give it a rest, if for some reason you hink I owe you something then all you have to do is ask. Crap I considered you one of my twinks.<br>
<br>
This has been mildly ammusing, and to be honest I am bit suprised you attacked me here, You usually just go straight to the point with me in our conversations. <br>
<br>
BTW coming back to work from lunch I almost hit a cat, screw you Quas.<br>

<br>
BDs from months ago.... BDs you were just meaning to give out to people.....  Rigggghhhto.<br>
<br>
Bought and gave out DOTs?  This was rare at best and I remember times when syllie had to switch to lesser Marks because she'd run out of her own DOTs.<br>
<br>
Get straight to the point?  I have been all day today.  You hurt someone I consider a dear friend, and part of the LM family (even if she did detag).  I'm fed up with you, fed up with your lies, and fed up with your self-serving greed.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;memory flash&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
This just in (geez, there's been so many lies that it's an effort to remember them all) .... I got a tell from you on Friday, stating that you werent going on the LM PoA raid the Smokiex was running.  As you said it... &quot;Unless Smokiex absolutely needs me to tank, I'm not going&quot;.  Well... considering the fact that you were sniped the night before, this was perfectly understandable... no biggie.  Well... that night I get a tell from Smokiex... asking who told you that you werent welcome on the raid.  Again with the lies... you bail on a raid and then lie about the reasons to try and cause strife.<br>
<br>
Mission not accomplished.<br>
<br>
And as far as the amusement factor goes... no.  This isnt amusing.  It's sad.  You are a wretched human being Craig.  <br>
<br>
And I think I'm gonna just keep on posting, cause I really want people to know what you're really about.<br>
<br>
Oh... and btw... still waiting on those logs to be posted.  You know, the ones that dont exist?<br>
<br>
Have a nice day<br>

There are two things that piss you off in this world, and EVERYTHING calls into these categories...<br>
<br>
1: Why does things happen when they shouldn't imo?<br>
2: Why doesn't something happen the way i want it?<br>
<br>
Keif, at 44 you have no right to push for epic in my opinion...<br>
There are people that has been in the guild for over 2 years and STILL don't have epic..<br>
<br>
Sodina, did she ever push? not from what i see<br>
Quas? he never pushed for his epic, he earned it from level and admiration<br>
Ect. i can repeat the process with 20 people or more<br>
<br>
Alleusion? WINE WINE WINE<br>
I thought Alle was a nice person the first few raids until i really saw it..<br>
gotta get 60, gotta get 60, ae ae ae, gotta get 60 *cry*<br>
Alleusion says &quot; Only 15k more for clarity 3&quot; *hint hint*<br>
I need 30k for C3, this is horrible<br>
Can anyone help me get C3? *sigh*<br>
Ohh nobody wants to help me with epic, i guess i don't deserve it...pff<br>
<br>
This is only a game, who cares when ya get what, and when things dont happen the way and when you want them to...<br>
<br>
I never been the best player to Quas, but he is strong and i sure love that silly bastard as much in game as i do in Real Life...so for him to get any rippings from either of you 2 that bitch and moan all day wanting your way, he is head strong and plays this for what it is..<br>
<br>
A GAME<br>
<br>
Now if you guys wanna keep complaining, go cry yourself to sleep on your pillows and let life turn over upside down because of a video game,  while Autumn, Syllie, Quas, myself, all of us go and have a jolly good time and be able to come home from a hard day's or work and sit in front of the comp from time to time..<br>
<br>
I am in defense of Lor Mani and all of those spectacular (sp?) people i have met within my times...and now they will be even better.<br>

Saying sorry only lasts for so long. Like Quas said I am a grown woman and I need to be responsible for my actions. I have no idea WTF is up with the Fandrell issue but I REFUSE to be dragged into that one.<br>
<br>
I apoligize for not playing this game since beta and allowing little things like getting 60 and my epic to come between what really matters. Hindsight is 20/20 and I can see now what I've lost.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and Xastin...as for the lvl 60 and c3 thing...never once did I directly ask anyone in the guild for money. Matter of fact I earned all of that by myself with the exception of 4k given to me one night by a very nice person who I have yet to find so I can repay him.
