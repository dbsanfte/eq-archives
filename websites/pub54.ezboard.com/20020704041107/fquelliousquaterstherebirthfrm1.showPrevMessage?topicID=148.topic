(hellloooooo anyone out there??)<br>
<br>
Please don't take this as an insult, but if your highest is lvl 37 how can the politics of plane raids and uber guilds effect you?<br>
<br>
Sure there is lots of talk about it here, but in the game how much does it really effect YOU? <br>
<br>
You play a Shaman AND a bard, both of which are highly needed in exp group and even raids when you get some levels. <br>
<br>
I have been on this server for almost two years now, and if you think fighting over spawns is even an issue now, you should have been there before kunark, before velious.<br>
<br>
There was ONE good sword. There was ONE good robe. There was ONE haste sash.  Imagine what it was like back then!<br>
<br>
If the game is not fun for you , then no reason to play. If however your not able to be able to have fun because something is camped then there are TONS of other places to go! Across all my chars I would have over 130 days plus played easy and I still have not seen so much of the world! <br>
<br>
My second char was a shaman, I got to 49 soloing most of the time, and I did not have the luxary of kunark or velious. I regreted that later, since I found out that grouping was the real fun in this game. <br>
<br>
 I did not notice a guild tag for ya there, maybe you should hook up with a guild? Find a small group of people that are all friendly and hunt together, try to get into their guild and have fun!<br>
<br>
Also if your having a problem with KS 'ers or something like that then you would have the guild to back you up. Something I learned LONG ago was that that means much much more then a GM who doesnt care about *YOU* like your guild does.<br>
<br>
I hate to bring this up again but at lvl 37 what uber guild would be screwing you over? In my time in eq its the smaller less &quot;known&quot; guilds or people that your going to have a problem with.  If it is a guild then try talking to their guild leader or members about the situation. 99% of the time if you were in the right then they will call off their member.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways just my &quot;bored as hell at work&quot; post of the day. Im sure Daku will come along soon and write this alot better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
People read several message boards and listen to gossip, then form an opinion of things to come based on gossip. Despite what you read uber guilds are NOT screwing people over left and right and they're not farming items into worthlessness.<br>
<br>
Im sure this point is going to be beaten to death over the next few days, but ill get my hits in. You're maximum is 37. You've never been on a raid, nor do you understand what goes on and how we deal with FFA planes. This is not a fault, its merely something you are not able to do yet.<br>
<br>
Among the 400 BILLION people on this server (well it SEEMS like 400 billion in sebilis on a sunday) there are MAYBE 5 avid farmer and MAYBE 50 overzealous ones. Now look at real life. There are what 3 million people in New York out of which over 250,000 are serving felony sentences in jail. Any world is always going to have its share of Syedoths and other assorted arse bandits running around. The differance is you can IGNORE them in EQ.<br>
<br>
Now onto the subject of evil &quot;uber&quot; guilds. Since you havent acheived level suffecient to deal with them, im assuming your knowledge of them comes from boards. Based on that assumption, we'll adress the most abused first. Vis Maior. <br>
     Ok maybe we didnt like the direction they were taking what 6 months ago? But honestly have any of you been dicked over by them recently or even not so recently? Nope. Fact is there are about 5-6 &quot;jagoffs&quot;, to use your word, in that guild of i think 40+ people leaving 34+ people taking abuse for it. <br>
     Fact is i was in fear recently (still have 2 corpses up there) and my guild was clearing the plane (aside from CT), we had a few mobs and draco left to deal with. Do to a weird pull, Draco noticed us and came over for a snack. After snacking on us, Draco trotted over to Vis, who were making their way to CT, and snacked on them. I dont care how uber you are, no one can take down draco when they are not prepared. After a valiant attempt, Draco gated and went wimpering to CT who got a little miffed about the whole thing.<br>
 (hence the famous line)<br>
<br>
A dracoliche gates.<br>
Cazic Thule shouts &quot;RAVENARK&quot;<br>
You tell the guild &quot;mommie&quot;<br>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
<br>
Anywhooo CR is done rapidly. Vis hands draco a smack down. Soullance then walks over and splits the draco loot with us since we had agreed on my guild attempting him 1st. I think 2 items dropped and we got the uber uber Wizzy &quot;I wanna look like a noob mage&quot; robe. <br>
<br>
So lets dismiss your dispute against Vis. Now onto Wraith.... um name one time they've wronged you. <br>
<br>
(2 hours later)<br>
<br>
Ok lets move on. Lotus Cult.... besides Ishan being a member, name ONE time they've wronged you.... ok you know what i dont have another 2 hours to wait <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Here's the point, If you wish to leave because the game is poorly done and has very little dynamic playability, by all means quit and enjoy any new games. But if you're going to quit based on gossip and a beleived &quot;high level&quot; gamming that you have yet to experiance, then i suggest you at least try it out on your own, Then, form you OWN personal experiance.<br>

For me, EQ is very fun at this point in time because I get to go to places I never thought I would go to.  I get to do some of the very fun things I never thought I'd do in game. <br>
<br>
Don't let the message boards taint your view of high lvl games.  Guilds are generally fairly civil about free for all.  FFA works more like first come first serve.  If you see Wraith in zone at ToV, most likely VM will be else where.  <br>
<br>
Example.  I need to turn in the Fiery Avenger the other day to get the Fiery Defender.  Do I tell all my friends/guildmates to meet me at Fear portal?  No.  I do a /who all druid 46 52. This tells me whois in Fear.  Then I send tells to two druids to get the name of the raid leader.  Then I check the progress of the raid with the raid leader and in turn he checked to make sure my Quest Mob is up.  Through the next 2~3 hours we would keep in touch about the raid progress.  Once the raid wraps up, we zone in, kill a few remaining mobs and do Epic turn in and move out.  <br>
<br>
I think the message boards generally gave negative feelings about the game.  Not often you see the positive side of stories.<br>

Timbre, if you aren't having fun, just leave.  Don't look back though, because if you do, it is hard to stay away (bleh I am even thinking of coming back for Sullon Zek).  There are better games out there (certainly less addictive ones <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ). <br>
<br>
If you aren't having fun at 24 and 37, you probably are not going to have fun later. Trust me, because I didn't have much fun 35 and past.  It never changed.  Do what is fun for you.  If that is EQ, play EQ.  If it isn't EQ, then don't waste your time here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ulalian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lalian</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://members.tripod.co.uk/redhotant/icons/iconoc15.gif  BORDER=0> at: 7/5/01 6:24:37 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usfemwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>S Femwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/5/01 8:15:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm outta....</span><hr size=1> *scrunches her nose at Wyen Wyen Wyen Wyen* <p><BR><img src=http://sachem.freewebspace.com/images/sach2.jpg><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uledronesoultaker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ledrone Soultaker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/9/01 3:53:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm outta....</span><hr size=1> Careful, Wyen will accept anything with open arms.

Sorry, I worded my statements wrong, or rather, didn't go into enough detail.  Yes, my characters aren't high enough to have personally experienced raids or extensive contact with Wraith, Vis, LC.  My knowledge of all the crap that goes on comes from these messageboards.  Maybe its my own fault for spending too much time reading these boards?  <br>
<br>
Then again, we've already established I'm not of sufficient level to really encounter these problems yet, so that can't be all thats bothering me.  I think what really drove me to quit was the slow pace of the game.  It takes forever to get anything done.  That, and there really ISN'T anything to do except level and acquire items.  The tradeskills are a joke.  Sure you can sign on just to hang out with friends, but you can do that outside EQ.  <br>
<br>
Before you break out the &quot;Play for fun, not to win&quot; and &quot;EQ is a journey not a destination&quot;, I know.  I've said it myself and I believe it, for the most part.  But, nobody does anything without a goal in mind.  A year ago my goal was to have fun with friends, I spent hours doing nothing but sending /tells back and forth or sitting with higher levels (Kal <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) watching them kill stuff I was too low to help with.  After I came back this last March, I found half of my friends had quit and rest had advanced beyond me.  I think thats when my goal changed to leveling.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm wrong about everything, maybe I don't know crap about EQ.  No matter how you cut it, It's not fun for me anymore.  There are a lot of MMORPGs coming in the near future.  I'll be keeping an eye out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umipp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mipp</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/10/01 8:47:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=143.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://mippmapp.dyndns.org/images/heads/sigpic_06.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Yup yup...</span><hr size=1> yes I agree the pace is incredibly slow!!
