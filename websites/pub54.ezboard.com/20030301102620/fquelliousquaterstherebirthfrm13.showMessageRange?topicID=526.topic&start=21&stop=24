<br>
1.  Maybe the server didn't have time to record the kill before the crash? how long was emp dead before the server crashed?<br>
<br>
2. Lag is hard to confirm. The GMs don't sit in the server room and watch which server is lagging.. How do they know it wasn't your ISP.<br>
<br>
3. that one shouldn't have taken a week.<br>
<br>
4. There are a lot of petitions daily.. They responded to your as fast as they could I'm sure. I don't think GMs have the ability to reset abilities.<br>
<br>
5. One followed the rules one didn't guess which.<br>
<br>
6. Sharing is one of those things in the EULA that Verant uses to protect themselves.. Have you seen anyone banned for using EQw?<br>
<br>
7. Yea thats silly but its their rule.<br>
<br>
8.  Remember a lot of people are volunteers.. Therefore they don't get paid for their work.. When people don't get paid they are likely to do their job less efficiently.<br>
<br>
When you really think about it.. A lot of the rules makes sense.  CS for any company is one of the departments that are hard to do well especially when the majority are volunteer.<br>
<br>
The worst thing about CS is they are usually only needed in a problem and most people who come in are either hostile from the beginning or short tempered.  The CS members are also human and they make mistakes that doesn't make them dumb or uncaring.<br>
<br>
remember many of the rules in place are designed to prevent cheating.. How many people know others that tried to take advantage of a bug or whatever to gain extra equipment unfairly?  Remember when that Sharlock pack or whatever it is was made LORE was it? and Verant asked people to list items that were lost when they logged in.. Well how many people said they had CoFs and cobalt BPs or whatever when they did not?<br>
<br>
Thats why reimbursement rules are against the victim. <p><center>

1.  I work for a webhosting company that hosts about five thousand sites.... with the backup software we use it's possible to restore files to a specific minute.  If EQ chooses not to use software powerful enough to support their systems then that is THEIR inability to provide quality service.  The point of a LOG file is to keep track of events as they happen.  If the logs are not being kept current they are useless.  It should happen right away, and a few minutes should be more than enough time.<br>
<br>
2.  I don't deny people lag and I don't deny it's impossible for them to keep track of lag.  My cynical point was this.... even when they know they are having problems they blame it on the user.  Been to Ssrae or Seru lately?  People that originally reported that lag were told they needed to update their video cards.  Nevermind the fact the zones were brought down a few days later to patch something that was obviously serverside.  Also it's retarded that it takes more than 3 hours to get a response to a rez petition when your corpse's timer only lasts that long.<br>
<br>
3.  Agreed.<br>
<br>
4.  I didn't actually expect them to reset my ability, my point was that I've /bug reported this on 5 different occasions yet none of the Guides/GM's had even heard of it before (they have a section of the GM board dedicated to common bugs for informational purposes so the CS staff isn't completely ignorant).  Obviously the people taking care of the /bug reports communicate very well with the CS department.<br>
<br>
5.  I understand there's rules to be followed out there and I know the rules for such cases.  My point is why give out conflicting messages like that?  It makes CS a roll of the die.  If you get an asshole GM you are stuck, if you get a nice GM you win.  What's to stop me from re-petitioning the same item in the hopes I get a different decision.  Oh wait that's causing more work for GM's if I do that, maybe they should just make up their minds and be consistent in the first place.<br>
<br>
6.  Of course you won't see anyone banned for using eqw, it's not exactly easy to prove.  When I /reported someone admitting they were breaking the rules I would assume that those rules were put there for a reason.  If you're not going to enforce them why bother?<br>
<br>
My comments aren't so much directed at the guides either, they're directed at GM's (who are paid for what they do).  They're the ones who leave the red petitions in queue, not the guides.  I started out working for not much more than they did but with hard work and efficiency I've been able to move up in the ranks quite well.  If EQ CS provides no manner by which GM's can advance then that is their flawed system that is the cause of the problem.  If I take weeks to address a customer's problem you're damn sure I'll hear about it from my boss.  The point of this posters thread was that they weren't really accountable to anyone so what's the point in trying to perform well?  Everyone would pass any course if they were free to grade themselves.....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>

<br>
I totally agree with this statement.  What I don't agree with is classifying every single person who has issues with customer service as being a fool who expects too much.  If someone has a problem and I don't have it solved within 5 minutes and they're bitching at me for not helping them, I'd consider that unreasonable.  If someone has a problem and it takes me weeks to resolve that problem while I make no real effort towards fixing things and generally ignore them, then the customer has every right to be upset. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A> at: 9/19/02 11:32:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/u26hesseth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>26Hesseth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/20/02 1:29:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=526.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another Solid Read</span><hr size=1> LOL they have over 70 CS people..

I have petitioned, my own demands were not unreasonable. I am thus not a fool. The people I was referring to were very specifically called fools because of their unreasonable demands. <br>
<br>
I work in CS, essentially, as I am a claims rep for a major insurer. My job is exactly like what I did as a Guide for Verant 2 years ago. The only difference is that my RL jobs deals with honest to God serious problems that frikken matter, not piddly shite little BS problems like someone admitting that a friend shared their account.<br>
<br>
To each person, their personal issue is enormous. It is the CS rep's job to try and consider that persons feeling by treating their problem with respect. After the 700th frikken goon that asks you to spawn Zephyl so they can get their frikken jboots, then bitches at you for not doing it, you get a tad jaded. After the 3000th person whines to you about dying to lag, you get actively cynical.<br>
<br>
Lag is a BS issue. TFB Salta, there's a whole lotta internet between you and VI that could be the source of that lag. They sure as hell can't control it. I sympathize that you died and had corpse recovery problems, but suck it up and move on. If I had a frikken dollar for every time someone begged me for a GM Rez as a Guide....<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that thier CS is great, it ain't. All I'm saying is take a step back and look at what yer bloody well whining about. It's a damned game that you pay less than a buck an hour to play. Entertainment don't come any cheaper than that. It's also a game that some 400000 other people pay less than a buck an hour to play, and they all have terribly important petitions too.<br>
<br>
Recently, VI set a new record, 100000 people on. So, how many GM's were online at that time? How many Guides? How many do you expect they should have for that many simultaneous users? The math don't work, there's no way for it to work and be economic.<br>
<br>
As to the system being against you, people lie. People lie about lag death, item loss, all kinds of crap. Why? Because they aren't looking a real person in the face when they're lying. I remember sitting in LGuk one night, and watching this gnome pull a massive train. Little shit died horribly. About 10 minutes later, zone crashes. Once I manage to get back, that same gnome sends a petition demanding a rez because he died due to the zone crash. I refused his rez request and issued a warning, but that's a rare opportunity to catch a liar in the act.<br>
<br>
VI has their CS set up to try and save money, fuckin sue em for trying to be profitable. They have their CS set up to try and maximize the knowledge of their Guides by using actual players, sue em for using an abundant natural fanboy resource. <br>
<br>
The point I am making is that you might want to try, just try, to look at it objectively. As a former Guide and a guy that works the RL version of Guiding every day, VI's CS is at least tolerable enough. Like I said, you want better service, pay for it. That's what Legends is for. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>
