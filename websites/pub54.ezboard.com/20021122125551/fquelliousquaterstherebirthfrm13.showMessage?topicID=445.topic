Pro war Pro Ground troops.  etc.<br>
<br>
But on this iraq thing i just cant support the president.  here are my reasons.<br>
<br>
1) there is no basis for this invasion of iraq in international law that we signed on. <br>
<br>
 If you can reduce every invasion being justified by &quot;they arnt a democracy and they have anti &lt;insert our country name here&gt; rhetoric&quot; then welcome to world war 3.  A world where peace is had only by your military might.  Where if you are armed and &quot;anti-this country&quot; then that is reason enough for an invasion in our defense.  <br>
<br>
This guys is BAD.  This is the age old precursor to large violent wars.  This is exactly what the people are told in those past stories in history where you cant understand how the people went alone with their government.  <br>
<br>
THIS IS WHAT THEY WERE TOLD.  &quot;we are invading this country that hasnt attacked us to protect ourselves&quot;   THIS IS HOW IT STARTS.  and from there its a domino effect.  We are the aggressor from there on.  from there on we are outside of international law.  We certainly cant be saved by it.<br>
<br>
We are at the door step of a terrible start to the 21st century.<br>
<br>
2)  Some how a war on iraq is justified by sadams willingness to supply weapons of mass destruction to islamic fundamentalist terrorist.  MUST BE.  Why?  Because only islamic fundamentalist terrorist have aggressed against us.   Our internationally understood right to defend ourselves exist only against that axis of islamic fundamentalist terrorist.  So where does Saddam sit with them?  HE IS THERE ENEMY.<br>
<br>
If you were a taliban in Iraq you would be arrested then EXECUTED the next day.  He is a violent evil secular dictator with a strong history of being the enemy of islamic fundamentalist.  He doesnt allow them to exist in his country his police force has and does round them up and kill them. <br>
<br>
IF saddam gave islamic terrorist weapons of mass destruction he would be just as likely a target as us.  He is there enemy.<br>
<br>
Give credit to bush he is only off by one letter.  The rhetoric being tossed around in favor of invading iraq is more suited to iran. <br>
<br>
Why would iraq want weapons of mass destruction if not to support terrorism?  For traditional state activities.   He doesnt want to plant bombs in our buildings.  He wants the ability to act as a state with dangerous potency.  VERY DIFFERENT.  Already having demonstrated that he has NOOO tyes to the only party to aggres against us, the axis of islamic fundamentalist terrorist, its not enough to presuppose that he will plant them on our soil.<br>
<br>
So what would be real criteria for invading iraq?  Gathering hard evidence that they are in the final stages of preparing to commit an act of war AT THE MINIMUM.  Democracies go to war to preserve themselves.  So where is this evidence?   Merely collecting weapons of mass destruction while in violation of some past treaty doesnt constitute finding evidence that iraq is preparing for war?  But we really dont have evidence of that.   <br>
<br>
There are no ties to the terrorist that aggressed us.  There is no history of iraq terrorist activity against the US. There is no evidence of weapons of mass destruction.  even if there were there are no intercepted evidence of iraqs intention to use them again as an aggressor other then some rhetoric at the top.<br>
<br>
This is not an internationally legal war.  This is not a democracy going to war to preserve itself.  This is the age old start to long term domino effect world wide aggression.  We cant go down this road.<br>

the reason bush wants to start a war is simple.  war fuels the american economy.  nothing would make our ailing economy recover faster than a good old war.  better economy = better scores for mr. bush in public opinion polls.  sentiments of nationalism are already as strong as they have ever been, enough so to have already done considerable damage to free speech and other civil rights.  a war right now would be largely supported by the populace due to the strong post 9/11 nationalism.  it's all politics.  it makes me sick <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
There are many legal bases for the United States to attack Iraq, were that to happen.<br>
<br>
1) It is permitted under the UN Charter.<br>
<br>
Each nation has the right to self-defense under Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.  That right is not limited to responding to a direct armed attack.  The doctrine of Anticipatory Self Defense allows a nation to strike first to prevent the attack.  This doctrine has been around for Centuries.  It relies on the idea of a hostile intent.  To give an example – if a person is point a gun at you, must you wait until they fire to shoot them?  The use of Gas on the Kurds was done for practice. <br>
<br>
2) It is permitted by the Security Council resolutions.  <br>
<br>
Security Council Resolution 687 ended the Gulf war, but imposed conditions on Iraq.  Iraq is flagrantly disregarding the conditions that were mandated and they accepted.  The U.S. has the Authority under Resolution 678 to use all force necessary to enforce those conditions.  If that means the US has to destroy the current Iraqi regime, then it has that right under international law.<br>
<br>
3) International law may actually compel the US intervention.<br>
<br>
This may be the weakest basis but perhaps the most compelling.  The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide compels all signatories to actively prevent Genocide.  The Gas attacks on the Kurds at Halabja violate this and the Chemical and Biological weapons convention.  We, unfortunately, have never interpreted the treaty to allow us to intervene see, e.g. Cambodia, &amp; Rwanda.<br>
<br>
You misunderstand Saddam Hussein.<br>
<br>
You apply a western interpretation to his actions.  You believe that since he does not allow certain actions within his country he would not associate with the fundamentalist.  This is not the case.  Saddam has embraced Al-Qaeda.  The Iraqi intelligence service uses the Al –Qaeda for its own purposes – it is a marriage of convenience.  The Al- Qaeda gets supplies and weapons and Iraq uses them against the Kurds.<br>
<br>
Saddam has embraced the militant fundamentalists because he can better keep them in line.  You must understand that everything he does is calculated.  Saddam Hussein is not a fool – he may underestimate his opponents from time to time, but has managed to stay in power for over 20 years.<br>
<br>
Hussein would very much like to take the war to the US – the use of Al Qaeda may allow him to do it without having his fingerprints on the action.<br>
<br>
As to other Bio weapons.  Iraq is experimenting with Alfatoxin.  What is that?  It is a bio agent that when placed in food or breathed is a virulent carcinogen.  This is a long-term insidious weapon.  It has NO battlefield uses.  Why is he developing it?<br>
<br>
The reason we can’t show that WMDs are located at any specific place is that Iraq is preventing the inspections.  Your argument that there is no proof is merely wishful thinking and based upon faulty logic.<br>
<br>
If you want more insight on the Iraqi Chem-Bio weapons use and capabilities the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://mywebpage.netscape.com/kurdistanobserve/goldberg-great-terror.html">New Yorker</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> did a great, if lengthy article on it.  <br>
<br>
Oppose the any potential action as you wish, but at least have your facts first.<br>

What are you smoking bro?  You liken Bush to Hitler with your jackboot comment, and then you make an assinine statement about him deciding the UK could be a threat?? WTF??  There is no basis for that, and there is no way he could ever get public support for it, unless there was some proof available showing that the UK government was behind the 9/11 attacks.<br>

It is really easy for all of you to badmouth the guy that is in the hotseat.  The US Presidency has to be the most fucked up job in the world to have.  More stress than anyone has a right to put up with, no privacy at all, and constantly having every move he makes inspected and criticized.  He is dealing with the most devastating time this country has been through since the Vietnam War, and despite his shortcomings, he isn't doing that bad of a job.  Cut the guy some slack.

 Try having a few airplanes fly into your skyscrapers and murder several thousand of your fellow men women, and children. Then try and say how we shouldn't take the fight to these people. Try having that many people's lives destroyed because some religous zealots can't tolerate other views. <br>
<br>
 Iraq has shown agression in the past, and wil again in the future. Why do you think Iraq has kicked the weapon inspectors out over and over again? <br>
<br>
 People think Bush isn't smart or doesn't know what he is doing beacause your told to believe that. The guy fumbles a few words and hes declared an idiot. Well, like the rest of you oafs I hope our enemies underestimate him as well. <br>
<br>
 Bush as brought back some dignity and respect to the office of the President. After 8 years of the money grabbing, affair having clown that was Clinton, I couldn't be more pleased with Bush.<br>

 Europeans should think back about 50 years and remember what sitting on their hands got them. It got them their asses handed to them by a lunatic, and guess who came to bail them out? <br>

This has to be one of the most foolish thing I have read.  I am an American.  To bash the Europeans for being cowards is Lunacy.<br>
<br>
Lets look at these cowards:<br>
<br>
France, Britain and Germany left a Generation dead in the fields of Belgium and France between 1914 and 1918.  Trench warfare -- charging en masse into Machinegun fire.  The British at Passchendale -- cowards --look at the casualties.  They lost more that day than we lost in all of WWI.<br>
<br>
The next Generation of Germans, French and British?  Wiped out at Stalingrad, North Africa, Italy, Burma, India.     <br>
<br>
Those cowardly British sailed halfway around the world and fought, vastly out numbered without landbased aircraft, a modern well equipped nation over some islands that only sheep could love.  They won.<br>
<br>
The cowardly Europeans were the only peacekeepers trying to prevent war in Bosnia when the US refused to help.<br>
<br>
I think the Europeans have a reason to be wary of war.  <br>
<br>
You may disagree with them, but we, as a nation have not earned the right to call them cowards.<br>
<br>

<br>
One of the major world war II battles was the battle of Britain where British Aircraft (Spitfires) were outnumbered 4-1 with the Lutwaffe.  The Germans were also in the process of developing the V1 Rockets which were used towards the end of the siege and Spitfires had to shoot these down.  <br>
<br>
Germany (quite wrongly) turned their own attacks from the airfields of UK to London after we bombed Berlin in retaliation with 4 of our own bombers.  <br>
<br>
We held them off and then began the siege of Normandy where allied troops invaded in the biggest clusterf**k of an operation ever.<br>
<br>
Another major Nazi mistake was not to wake Hitler when the attacks began .. he apparently had a huge amount of Panza / Tiger tank units in position 10 miles from Normandy waiting for the invasion to happen upon his orders.  <br>
<br>
If in the event, England (the last outpost of Europe) hadn't held out in the Battle of Britain - the U.S. today would more than likely be under Nazi influence.  <br>
<br>
And one of the main reasons why the U.S. 'bailed' us out was because of their own interests.  Japan were allied with Germany and obviously the attack on Pearl Harbour had caused a huge dent to American confidence.  <br>
<br>
Japan were being supplied technology by the massively superior germans.  Dosen't take a brain surgeon to work out in those days (or nowadays) you cut off supplies someone is gonna struggle.<br>
<br>
By saying that England for one have not been victim of Terrorism, all you got to do is look at the bombings that the IRA have inflicted to us over the last XXX amount of years and the terrorist attack on the Iranian Embassy in the UK in the 1980s.<br>
<br>
Yes, you want retribution for it of course you do.  <br>
<br>
When I heard of the September 11th incident, I was disgusted.   I was immediately wary about what was gonna happen next and I totally supported Tony Blair's declaration to stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with the Americans.  <br>
<br>
But in terms of a politician I do not think George Bush is very good.  He may be an excellent militant leader (very much like Margaret Thatcher / Winston Churchill was) but I think that Bill Clinton was a much better diplomat.  <br>
<br>
So what, he had his plums sucked on my a horse faced cow.  Happens all the time.<br>

Many men with higher placed families did nowhere near so well. Many sons of former presidents have been a joke in fact, vis a vis Ron Reagan Jr. <br>
<br>
B) Reagan was bad? In whose book? Don't make me smack you. Reagan was one of the greatest presidents we've had in this country. The fall of the Soviet Union was largely the doing of his administration, IMO. Much of America's success in the 90's is a direct result of events the Reagan administration set in motion in the 80's.<br>
<br>
C) Saddam Hussein is a beast, a monster, but he is also a balancing point in that region. As essentially a secular govt, he is a huge aggravation for the worst fundamentalist. The fact that he provides money to them is likely more a matter of fear as well as political usefulness.  Does he need to be removed? Yes, he does. His course is a dangerous one and will lead ot ruin for more than just his nation. Should we go to war against him? I don't really think so. I don't think the case has been made.<br>
<br>
The problem I have with much of this thread is the rampant Bush-bashing. There is a lot going on here and Bush is not being as blatantly stupid as you might think he is. While we hear sabre-rattling and threats, have we seen mass recruitment or build-up in ground forces? Have we seen treaties negotiated with local powers to provide ground bases? Have we seen attempts at coalition building? No. All we have seen are threats.<br>
<br>
Why is this? One answer is that such threats destabilise Iraq inherently. The threat of another pounding by the West is going to cause unrest in the country. There are local elements in place that deeply hate Hussein. What might it take for those elements to activate and take him out themselves? It is against the odds, of course, but what does it cost? A few articles on a possible threat from us? That's expensive =P<br>
<br>
The other thing you aren't looking at is that it might just be working. Driving in to work today, CBS News Radio had a report that Hussein was backing down off his refusal to allow UN Weapons inspectors into Iraq. While he's trying to maneuver politically with this, it is still backing down from his hard-line point. <br>
<br>
I see this administration's threat as having accomplished a small win today. If Hussein backs down and allows the UHN Inspectors back into Iraq, he loses face. His nerve will have broken first. I call that a good thing.<br>
<br>
The other thing I think many people aren't looking at is the fact that the administration admitted that they were planning on putting out disinformation. The whole sabre-rattling thing has all the hallmarks of a ploy to me. I doubt we will go through with it, unless someone stupid takes it too seriously. So far, it has been all talk, smoke and mirrors, and I think the sheep are believing it. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

My God, I'm still flabbergasted by the utterly moronic chest-pounding that is perpetrated by the small-brained portion of my own countrymen when the subject of Europe in the two World Wars comes up.<br>
<br>
We cannot even concieve of what the UK, France, Belgium, etc went through in WWI and WWII as we, as a nation, have never seen a modern occupation or war on our own home turf. Have you no idea the devastation that occurred in Europe as a result of these wars? And these people still kept on fighting.<br>
<br>
I have much love for Britain and its' people and hold them up as a persistant example of valour to this day. If there is a Navy more professional and competent than the British Fleet, I've not seen it. If there are troops better trained and more motivated than Royal Marines, SBS, SAS, Gurkha Rifles, etc, I've not heard of them. England is a small country and has and does accomplish mighty things. <br>
<br>
Don't belittle their courage when you obviously know little about it.<br>
<br>
Now, to you Brits out there bashing Bush (Raluvin=P), each nation has different needs and requirements. You've had your own governemental scandals and cleaned house afterwards. Was the result pretty? Not usually. Bush may not be the best president we've seen, but he is the result of too much dishonesty in the previous administration.Before you bash him because you fear that he _might_ do something stupid, look at his track record. I see no incredible blunders so far.<br>

I do not think history will be kind to Reagan.  We had really little to do with winning the cold war as much  the internal contradictions of the Soviet System had in losing it.<br>

Reagan's biggest accomplishment was in changing a merely huge deficit to an unbelievably enormous one.  <br>

Reagan won the Cold War by his willingness to throw large sums of money at Star Wars, and the Russians couldn't keep up and went broke.  Ask Margret Thatcher.<br>

We also have Reagan to thank for the prosperity of the 90's and Clinton to thank for the recession of the 2000's.<br>

<br>
A War will not necessarily gaurentee an economic rebound. In fact, Bush Sr.'s attempt at a legacy, Desert Storm, did not help him to a re-election. The economy faultered and stagnated, shortly after the success in the middle east. The trickle down economy effects did not occur, and they won't occur this time either. In fact, Bush Sr. went from an approval rating in the 90% range to not even getting elected. Bush #2 does not have the guidence of an unbiased group of people when it comes to dealing with the middle east, Colin Powel, who hit the lime light during the middle east conflict,  and many others are all his aids now, this is not good. Short of Margret Thatcher showing up and taking Bush #2 on a 3 day trip to a bunker in Colorado, we are seeing nearly the same thing we saw from Bush #1. Bush #2 is a sad excuss for a president. Perhaps Bush should try getting Bin Laden first then move on to bigger fish. There is no reason to mobilize an army against Sadam Hussien, he is clearly using this and Sept. 11th as a soap box to help boost the republicans in the next election and to help with his re-election bid, it won't work.  Congress needs to stop letting Bush #2 spend $500 million every few months to put him in the lime light. His spending is out of control, and the projects they are spent on are absolutly a waste. The people in Florida will count the votes right this time.<br>
<br>
As for the person, and any other person who makes a comment saying that we in the U.S. have suffered greatly at the hands of terrorists from the attacks of Sept. 11th, you are dead wrong. The people that reside in the middle east suffer through acts of terrorism and re-talitory actions EVERY DAY. More people have been injured and killed in that area than you can possible fathom. Yes the attacks on the towers were grusome and terrible, but imagine if it was that way every day for you. Our pain and suffering is miniscule compared to those elsewhere.<br>

<br>
You can thank Reagan for the dick in the ass you get from the banking industry. Reagan was nothing but a puppet for Nancy and still is. <br>
<br>
If you strongly believe that &quot;trickle down economics&quot; exists, you need to get out of the 80's. There is no proof that the idea lambasted by the (R) in the 80's has emerged. <br>
<br>
The economic recession is not really a recession, we are still growing just at a slower rate. Alan Greenspan was right back in the late 90's we were experiencing growth at a rate which the economy could not sustain. Anything over 2.5% growth is looked at as a warning sign of inflation. This is proven by the recent string of firms doctoring their books to make it look like their growth is still on par. No one except DOTcom companies and tech stocks has anything serious to worry about. The business cycle is exactly that, a cycle. We will be heading back to the peak again soon, and guess what? We will go back down after that, but I gaurentee that the economy will never &quot;devalue&quot; it will just grow at a slower rate. How can you blame Clinton for anything, I thought he was the do nothing President?<br>
