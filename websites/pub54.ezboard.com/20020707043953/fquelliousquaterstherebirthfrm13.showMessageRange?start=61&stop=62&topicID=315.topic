<br>
I'm sorry, but I don't recall saying anything like this. I never said EVERYONE was &quot;required&quot; to raise my children. In fact what I did say was:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My responsibility to my family is to make sure that we are not surrounded by useless members of society and when they are, to explain to them why that behavior is unexceptable.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That doesn't say that EVERYONE is required to raise my children. What that does say is the people I let my children around has alot (alot does not say everything) to do with who they grow up to be. I want my children to see all YOUR personalties so that he/she can choose the right path for him/herself when that time comes. I want my children to be better then me, not be just like me. <br>
<br>
Why blind a child from reality and then when he/she is 18 yo let them enter the world naive and dependent? I want my children to know what is coming their way. This world isn't the fantasy world some parents let their children believe it is. Those parents who baby talk their 12 yo make me sick to my stomach. People don't always say nice things, people don't take care of you, and people don't do what you want them too. If you believe that, then YOU are in a fantasy world. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ...death look....That is truly funny! *shivers*<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You are right Stylee, it is pretty funny. It's pretty funny that a child will come forth and tell the truth once they have been &quot;scared&quot; into it, so to speak. I'm not saying it is right or wrong to &quot;scare&quot; a child into anything and to be completely honest, I wasn't even in the room when they asked her again, but she knew I was there. The seriousness of the knife being brought to school must have smacked her in the face when parents and 2 police officials showed up. That, in and of itself is not anything any 7 yo should have to go through, but again, that is how the school decided to hanlde it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Do any of you, who are arguing so adamantly about the formation of human psyche, actually have any type of formal training in the area?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No book is 'the only way' to do anything. The books are written to give you insight and ideas. My Accounting degree is no where near a psychology, sociology, social psychology, counseling, anthropology, or anything at all related to human behavior, but being a successful parent is.<br>
<br>
If you want to debate, that is one thing, if you want to throw stones, that is another. Did you ever think that the smiley faces after comments are jokes. My rule of thumb is to read these board with the best of intensions. If you are a negative person, you will read them in a negative way and vice-verse. <br>
<br>
I don't claim to be perfect and I am not forcing my opinions on any of you. I believe in respect for other peoples opinions even if I don't agree with them. Agree to disagree.<br>
 <br>
We are pieces to a puzzle. We all think differently and when we come together we form a community. That is the community I want my family to be a part of.<br>

<br>
That's exactly what I was saying.  You can't just read one thing and hope to get all the answers.  If you truly want educated advice from people who do nothing but study children and families, read anything you can get your hands on that isn't formatted to be a Barnes &amp; Noble wussy self help book.  Get a sociology journal.  Read things that only professors and grad students read.  That's where the thick stuff is.<br>

<br>
Again, my sentements exactly.  I am not going to try to give you financial advice just because I read Money magazine and took two courses on economics.<br>
<br>
No I'm not trying to throw stones, though this is a flame board.  Just offering my advice since everyone is arguing what they &quot;think&quot; instead of what they have learned.  This whole community vs. parent argument is senseless.  Life is not black and white.<br>
