so, i have to CHOOSE one of my innummerable stories about moho? geez... <br>
lol here's one...probably my favorite, unless i forgot a better one.<br>
Me and Mohogany were both at the sebilis zone-in w/o a group. i was LFG while slowly soloing, and he was soloing and not apparently seeking a group. well i was sitting down regenerating, and medding from my last solo mob, and Lo and Behold, here comes Mohogany up the ramp with a frog... a frog that attacked me instead of him. immediately i said &quot;get you pull off me&quot; no response. the frog kept beating on me. obviously, the dumbfuck wasn't taunting, cuz all my damage sheilds had fallen, so i wasn't doing any damage, or aggro to the frog whatsoever. the frog was now down to about 3/4 hp. and i was down to about half. seeing that nothing was going to be done on his end, i jolted the frog. the frog started beating on him. he says &quot;WTF dont cast on my frog!&quot; at this point i was having a hard time deciding, IRL, whether to laugh my ass off, or bang my head on the desk repeatedly. i said &quot;i jolted YOUR frog dumbfuck, so he would hit YOU, not ME...ya know, there IS a thing warriors have called a TAUNT button. use it.&quot; i sat back down. the frog hit me again. the frog was about 2/3 health, mohogany at almost full health, and me at half health. at this point it is also no longer funny, but annoying as hell. i said &quot;ok dumbass, have it your way!&quot; i proceeded to bash and nuke the living hell out of the frog. again he says &quot;WTF get off my pull!&quot; Merrily bashing, nuking, and JOLTING now, i declared &quot;when your pulls dont hit me, i wont hit them.&quot; now i was laughing my ass off. everytime i nuked, i jolted right after, and the frog was finally staying on him. it took away about 3/4 of his life before it died. i had saved one last nuke, and as i cast it, my last nuke killed the frog. now i remind you, mohogany is a 59 war, and at the time i was a 58 ranger. who got the kill? HAHAHA! ME! now you can guess what happened next... Mohogany let out a string of profanity and nonsensical phrases first in say, then /ooc. i said &quot;guess you learned to taunt when soloing the hard way huh? lol....sad thing is...taught by a ranger <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> !&quot; i then put mohogany on /ignore, seeing that he wasn't going to stop his mouth anytime soon. but that didn't stop the flow of tells saying things such as &quot;about time someone did something like that to him&quot; and &quot;woohoo! go Nitrouz!&quot; and &quot;what the hell'd you DO?&quot; and my favorite &quot;he did that AGAIN?!?!&quot; i was in tears i was laughing so hard... i couldn't even reply to everyone who sent me a tell. <br>
<br>
keep in mind, this certainly wasn't my first mohogany experience, but definitely my favorite <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
and then there was the time, he had me on ignore, and he was alone near portal, and i shouted &quot;train to portal!!!!&quot; well...he didn't hear me... and the train was from chef... ouch. i imagine that hurt. well i dont imagine, i know. saw him naked at orb a minute later. oops. *shrug* one of the hazards of /ignore. i didn't even know he was at portal til i ran past him. <br>
in a later incident he said &quot;i wonder how you got off my /ignore list?&quot; hmmm....let me guess....   <br>
lol<br>
<br>
sorry this was so long, but once i get into telling a story...welll... i just keep telling, and telling, and...<br>
<br>

<br>
Haha this guy is one pathetic loser.. One time I was sitting at zone in seb like you were.. and since I was only level 54 at the time I couldn't solo much but I took a kor and maybe a zol here and there looking for a group, now I am killing a zol, and I see mohogany running up the ramp with a frog.. well that frog turned into 2, and than 3 and 4 and 5 and so on until he had at least 7 frogs there at zone, he yelled for help and yelled and finally died, there were about 6 other people at zone, 3 warriors (including myself) 1 pally and ranger, one other I can't remember, anyway, the frogs proceeded to beat on us, so pretty much I tell the pally and ranger to root them and run to zone, the other 2 warriors /q'd or camped or something,  as i started descending down the ramp headed for the exit, look what comes up, 3 more frogs which seemed to be late from his train, because I sure as hell didn't aggro them, the pally ranger and me all died about at the entrance to portal from being contsantly stunned. Anyway, a cleric friend of mine dragged all 3 our corpses and rezd with her rez stick, now shes asking &quot;should I rez moho?&quot; We all agree that we should let the pally revive him, so he gets consent, pulls him down in the nec guard beetle area, and he casts revive, he runs to zone and camps along with all of the others (you can only expect another train from moho) So all and all, it has no plot except that moho is an idiot.. I got one more good story to tell before I'm logging in to hit 58 =x<br>
<br>
I wasn't there personally but one of my closest RL friends was, he was hunting in cazic thule with moho and 2 druids, my friend was a SK, mohogany was pulling lizards (cant tell you what kind never hunted there) and after a while they were noticing my friend was getting all the aggro, problem was... my friend doesn't use taunt when a warrior is in the group. So they ponder why, and decide to ask him, Mohogany replies with &quot;I never trained taunt&quot; (but he did train something) after they said that he ran  deep inside, my friend said the tae room or something, and pulled out 2 red  conning lizards + many more and runs at the zone as fast as he can, training the group, disbanding, and camping, this was the first of anybody that ever heard of mohogany<br>

The first time I met him after about 5 minutes he was on ignore, and ever since then every time I see him he does all kinds of gestures but no text comes up, its hilarious.  He also likes to challenge people lower level to duels, and he has yet to defeat me.  I beat him with my monk at like 46 when he was 53 in the EC tunnel, ah yes I remember him fleeing to Nro when I kicked him in his neck and dropped him.  Or the time I dueled him in Seb when i was 52 and he was 60 in seb, I ran circles up and down the ramp ( and of course he had a frog on him ) after about 5 minutes of running up and down, my j boots finally wore off and I ran to the portal out, while glancing behind me in 3rd camera view as 10+ frogs beat the living hell out of that paper mache warrior as i zoned out.<br>

This was from way way back when I was still playing my bard, level 45 or so.  Pulling at north wall KC in DL.  Mohogany is pulling beside me for his group.<br>
<br>
  I pull, drop off, run out to find another mob, kite it till the group almost kills the last one, drop it off, rinse repeat.  Moho would pull it in and kill it, then run off to pull.  So we were moving a little faster than they were.  His enchanter asks to join our group instead (we both had 5) and moho sends me a tell swearing at me for stealing his enc...then he starts trying to steal my pulls...Well let me remind you what I was doing.  Kiting mobs (with dots) until my group finished.  Sometimes I would get a mob down to 1/2 ...so now this warrior is blatantly trying to steal pulls that I'm kiting around...and when that doesnt work...what does he do?  He aggro's about 5 drachnids (from webs maybe) and runs them around.  Next time he sees me pulling, he trains me with the 5 drachnids.  Luckily I was able to pull them away and run out of aggro before they rooted me.<br>
<br>
  So then, I see him pulling back about 4 mobs to his group.  I thought (uh oh, either thats gonna wipe them out and then attack us, or he's gonna train us again) so I pull 2 of them off him, 2 each.  He then tells me how he's petitioning me for KSing or some @#%$...<br>
<br>
