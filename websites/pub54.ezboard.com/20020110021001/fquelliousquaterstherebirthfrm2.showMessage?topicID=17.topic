<br>
The jungle air was laden with thick fog as Strumm and I ran toward the spectre-filled City of Mist. Verdant leaves hung heavy with moisture and the soft ground squished below our feet. The dense air echoed eerily with glottal croaking sounds from the riverbeds and creaking, hissing sounds from the underbrush… telltale signs of frogloks and mantraps. Giant mosquitoes buzzed ominously in the treetops.<br>
<br>
As Strumm lead the way, I was on the watch for these creatures and for the large Iksar skeletons that roamed, rattling, through the jungle. I was concentrating so much on the familiar sounds of the jungle that I did not hear the soft padded footfall of another person sneaking up behind me. Strumm heard it, however, and motioned for me to stop.<br>
<br>
“Radjan,” he said softly, “we have a visitor.”<br>
<br>
I stopped running and looked at him questioningly. His eyes indicated the thick brush to my right and he instinctively stepped in front of me.<br>
<br>
“Reveal yourself, friend.” I called over Strumm’s shoulder.<br>
<br>
There was a pause, then a slight rustling from the thicket. Slowly, a young wood elf appeared. She was no more than six or seven seasons. Her strawberry blonde hair was wildly tangled and damp from the underbrush. Her eyes, bright with fear, darted from my face to Strumm’s. So pathetic was she that I immediately knew no cause for alarm and sank to my knees in front of her. I was still slightly taller than she, even on my knees, so I sat, cross-legged in front of her.<br>
<br>
“What is it, child?” I asked tenderly.<br>
<br>
Her eyes now lifted and stared at Strumm. I looked up at Strumm and indicated for him to sit beside me. Ever wary of our jeopardous environment, he grudgingly sat down, but kept his eyes watchful. My eyes rested on the child.<br>
<br>
The wood elf swallowed hard but shook her head solemnly.<br>
<br>
I was confused, but I waited.<br>
<br>
She pointed at me, then at Strumm.<br>
<br>
“Go ahead,” I encouraged.<br>
<br>
Still, she was silent.<br>
<br>
I turned to Strumm, hoping he had a clue as to what the child was trying to indicate. He looked as confused as I was. The wood elf began to search through her ragged backpack. She pulled from it a parchment, rolled tightly and held with a velvet ribbon of such fine quality that I gasped that the suffering child could possess something so elegant. Attached to the ribbon was a tag. She held the tag out for me to see. On it was written, “Radjan.”<br>
<br>
“Why, that’s me!” I exclaimed.<br>
<br>
The child’s dirty face smiled at me and she began to shake with obvious pleasure.<br>
<br>
“You are looking for me?” I guessed.<br>
<br>
Her strawberry blonde head bobbed up and down.<br>
<br>
“Is that for me?”<br>
<br>
Again, she nodded, but then looked toward Strumm with questioning eyes.<br>
<br>
Strumm smiled softly at her and bowed his head gentlemanly, “I am Strumm, m’lady. What is thy name?”<br>
<br>
She held her slender wrist out to him. From a silver bracelet dangled a small charm. On the charm was written “Thayre.”<br>
<br>
“Young Thayre, we are pleased to meet thee. Surely you have not ventured into this dark place to deliver a message to my lady wife?”<br>
<br>
Thayre’s head bobbed up and down again. Then she handed me the parchment. I undid the soft velvet ribbon and unrolled the missive. I read the brief message and gasped, looking at Strumm. “’Tis from Coprinus, my love. He and Ssyrrin plan to meet us this eve in the City of Mist.”<br>
<br>
“Does it say why, love?”<br>
<br>
I re-read the parchment, “Nay. It simply states that it is a matter of importance and that a legal document must be executed in my presence.”<br>
<br>
I sat there on the damp ground of the Emerald Jungle, re-reading the message, looking for clues that never appeared. What important business would Coprinus and Ssyrrin have with me? I would have sat there longer, but my thoughts returned to Thayre and her trip into this dangerous area. Before heading to the City of Mist, I knew what I had to do.<br>
<br>
“We must get her safely out of this zone,” I said to Strumm.<br>
<br>
He nodded sagely and stood, offering me a hand. I stood beside him and beamed a smile at the small messenger.<br>
<br>
“Where would you like to go, my young friend?” I asked her.<br>
<br>
She contemplated my question and then held her hand out, indicating a height smaller than her own wee build.<br>
<br>
“Kaladim?” Strumm guessed, thinking of dwarves. Thayre shook her head and put her hands to her eyes, making a mask of her fingers. Blinking brightly through the holes, she smiled at him.<br>
<br>
“Rivervale!” He laughed and she giggled silently along with him.<br>
<br>
I smiled at them both, “Let us go back to the safety of the zone-line between this jungle and Trakanon’s Teeth. We shall ask our friend Calron to take you to Misty Thicket. Then he shall escort you to Rivervale.”<br>
<br>
Thayre nodded her head vigorously, her unruly hair falling into her face. My heart went out to the child. I leaned down and, using the beautiful velvet ribbon from Coprinus’ parchment, tied her hair back from her face. Thayre’s hand reached behind her head to stroke the ribbon there. She beamed a smile at me and threw her arms around my waist, hugging me tightly. I held her small frame carefully, pleased that I had made her happy.<br>
<br>
We all heard the awful rattling sound at the same time. I shifted my hold on Thayre just in time to shield her from a fierce blow. I dodged the next strike from the skeleton and lifted the child into my arms.<br>
<br>
“Radjan!” Strumm shouted, unsheathing his sword swiftly from its scabbard, “Run for the zone! I shall meet you there!”<br>
<br>
I hesitated, not wishing to leave his side. But the child in my arms trembled and sobbed, her head tucked into my shoulder. I knew I had to get Thayre out of this place.<br>
<br>
“Go!” He shouted, landing a solid strike onto the freakish skeleton. I turned and ran, dodging swaying trees and low-hanging vines. Thayre clung to me, her frail frame almost weightless in my arms, her eyes awash in frightened tears.<br>
<br>
At the zone line, I turned and waited, not wishing to zone over until I knew Strumm was safe. After what seemed like an eternity, I saw him emerge from the thick trees. He was running, but not panicked. He stopped and held us both in his arms.<br>
<br>
“Child, ‘tis okay. We are safe now.” He told her, stroking her hair. She shook convulsively in my arms. Strumm’s voice was gentle, “Look, Thayre. I have something for you.”<br>
<br>
Thayre raised her small head from my shoulder and looked at Strumm with red, puffy eyes. He held out to her a small bag. When she hesitated, he shook the bag. The contents rattled inside and she began to laugh silently. He had killed the skeleton that had almost killed her. I put her down and she took the bag and stowed it in her backpack.<br>
<br>
We then zoned safely into Trakanon’s Teeth together.<br>
