getting the next coldain traitor head for the 9th coldain ring.. A guildmate told me some group was camping outside.. <br>
<br>
So i asked someone in their group that we will be moving into the manor and he said ask the leader and i said the same thing to the leader and he said no prob (exact words). <br>
<br>
So we all move to manor and start pulling while we wait for late people. then guildmates starting receiving tells saying that we were stealing their camp so i talked with their leader in say and he said that was a mistel where he said we could move in (BS).. and i told him we are moving in for a quest and we will be in deep so dont worry about us then and he said you need to wait til we leave and of course we werent gonna do that as we did nothing wrong so we start moving in and they call a GM.. <br>
<br>
I took full responsibility and told the GM the truth he said he would be back and he wasn't cause I was right.. We moved in fast as we could and hopefully deep enough where they could still pull.  In the middle of the sequence 4 mobs appeared out of nowhere all stacked up so you could only see them as one and that isnt how mobs pop or aggro you.. They weren't part of the quest either as the quest mobs have special names..<br>
<br>
Guildmates said they saw someone run by but didnt get a name.. As you probably know what I'm getting at.. Im accusing Norrath's Pride of training on us to make us lose and If they did that they did a good job as we lost and had an hour corpse recovery.. We did it again and won after but thats not the point of this post...<br>
<br>
Norrath's Pride embarassed their name with childish name calling, whining, training, greediness, and anything else you get from this post..  If they were really Norrath's Pride they would have let us pass without question and do our thing as we really didnt interfer in anyway...<br>
<br>
I am looking for an apology from Norrath's pride mainly..<br>
<br>
If anyone else was there want to comment say so..<br>
<br>
I apologize for not having the logs as I formated and reinstalled my OS today and i forgot to back them up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/4/01 7:31:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Norrath's Pride or lack therof</span><hr size=1> oh, they insulted a few of our members and we did no such thing as we are behaved <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/upunkassgypsy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punkass Gypsy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Rat Bastard</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/4/01 7:37:36 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.nc.rr.com/temluin/Tristadorn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Norrath's Pride or lack therof</span><hr size=1> ~sigh~<br>

I've been in NP now for a while and it's the best guild I have ever been in.<br>
<br>
Trist - can't believe your words!<br>
<br>
Lalian - There are some great people in NP and it is so wrong to put a guild down just because of one misunderstanding.  I would never do this to another guild and hope that you will join us on more raids and see what a great bunch we really truely are! <p><b>

Would hate to show yourself up as a liar, wouldn't you?<br>
Our group was there first, we never once told you that you could move inside the manor (since we were pulling from there to the outside).  Also - we never trained you - how could we, we all teleported out of the zone - of course, your guildmates &quot;saw&quot; someone running by - sounds more like another one of Sirinab's infamous trains (since we all know she can't pull worth jack!)<br>
I will be MORE than happy to post the logs (since I didn't conveniently format my hard drive - was that the best excuse you could come up with?) on the Norrath's Pride message board tonight when I get home.  INCLUDING the messages from the GM who said you were basically disrespectful and showed absolutely no class whatsoever.<br>
This is standard Rel In Por Bullshit - invoke the PnP when it suits them, so they can muscle in on other people's camps and then whine that they got trained when they can't handle their pulls.  <br>
You'll get an apology from Norrath's Pride when you ADMIT that you lied to the GM's and you are lying here now about your recollection of the events.  In other words NEVER - since we all know that Rel In Por wouldn't know the truth if it walked up to them and kicked them in their collective ass.<br>

I'd be happy to dedicate a completely different thread to this if you wish but the poster of this thread had one of his very own guildmates training people in Thurgadin and RIP has yet to take action.  <br>
<br>
Sirinab found it amusing to kill the bankers over and over again so people would be unable to bank in Thurg.  Whether or not this is against any rules really doesn't matter as this was not the issue at hand.  Colach realizing that people were getting frustrated and that Sirinab would not give up his/her childish games engaged the next banker that popped so Sirinab couldn't kill it (would have been considered a KS).  He then let the banker beat on him while the 20 or so people banked and a nice cleric from NP named Talidorn healed him.  Sirinab (realizing he was foiling her plans rather than helping her) then went to aggro dorfs from the library and just &quot;happen&quot; to drag them by where Colach was letting the banker beat on him.  Sirinab being the incredibly bright player she is kept shouting &quot;Oh no, I can't find the zone to GD, I guess I better FD&quot; as she made it to the bridge before zone out.  After she unsuccessfully repeated this process and trained these guards past Colach for about 10 minutes she finally got one to aggro Talidorn (who was healing Colach) and he had to zone.  Clearly it seemed getting the cleric out of there wasn't enough and she once again ran by while shouting &quot;Oh no, I can't find the zone, I better FD&quot;.  After Colach had gotten down to about 20% life and I resorted to runing him a mob came by and bsed him for 350 followed by a quick double for 300+ and he was done.  Luckily Lifeguard being the kindhearted cleric that he is was nice enough to rez Colach and Sirinab quit her extremely mature &quot;kill the bankers and train Colach&quot; game once the GM showed up.<br>
<br>
So it seems your guild, who had both gae and drethkin (sp?) at this occurence to witness the actions of Sirinab, decided that her actions were completely acceptable.  Only someone who is an utter utter moron would not classify running back and forth in front of the bank w/ aggroed mobs and FDing in an attempt to get someone else killed &quot;training&quot;.  Yet you come on to the boards and flame NP because some people from your guild saw &quot;someone&quot; run by (what an accurate description of the offender..... there are about 2k or so &quot;someone's&quot; on quellious at that time of the night and there are an average of 50 or so &quot;someone's&quot; in kael).<br>
<br>
&quot;Guildmates said they saw someone run by but didnt get a name..&quot;   Such a good basis for attempting to drag a whole guild's name through the mud, they saw a someone everyone run and hide!!<br>
<br>
Here are the levels of the members that I am aware NP had in Kael last night.... 48 warrior, 52 cleric, 57 wizard, 55 mage, 53 druid.  If you honestly believe any of the higher level casters had the HP without SoW to train these mobs on you or if our fearsome level 48 half elf warrior (no offense Tov =P) had the HP to train these mobs on you without leaving a corpse nearby for you to see exactly who it was that trained you, then you need your head checked.  If these giants could not finish any one of those NP members off in the amount of time it took them to train then they must have been rather pansy giants and I would be rather embarrassed to say my guild's raid got wiped out by them.<br>
<br>
At least I had the decency to discuss Sirinab's actions in tells with one of the RIP members in the zone.  But instead of attempting to contact any NP officers about this occurrence you drag it onto the boards and I think it's pretty apparent why.  If I had no evidence or proof (or even a name for that matter) I would be hesitant to try and get the issue resolved in a civil manner as well.  At least everyone in Thurg that night (including your own guildmates) saw exactly who it was that was training mobs onto Colach but your accusations of training by NP is rather weak considering you can't even give a name much less a description.  Once the issue over the camp was raised in guildchat all NP members in Kael were asked to not stoop to the level of play some members of RIP have in the past.  They were told not to KS and not to train because we are better than that and as far as I know the entire group made their way out once the GM did nothing as far as letting them keep the rights to their camp.  <br>
<br>
For anyone who does bother to read that entire post I ask you not to judge the entirety of RIP based on the actions of a few members.  Like all guilds they have their bad seeds and most of their members are very honorable and fun players (jadina and skelli &gt; me =/ )  However for members of their guild to accuse NP of having a lack of pride because they saw &quot;someone&quot; is rather ridiculous.... it is even more ridiculous to take this straight to the flame boards rather than even attempting to settle it in tells when I and other officers were present.  I know Sirinab has trouble finding the GD zone out in thurg but I'm assuming that other RIP members at that raid at least had the ability to type /who all &quot;norraths pride&quot; to find someone to air their greivances to.  If you happen to &quot;remember&quot; who it was that trained you please feel free to contact me in game and the player will be dealt with accordingly, however I think it's pretty apparent that you wrote this entire flame talking out of your arse.<br>

Aeeny even posted on our boards asking for suggestions as to how to better handle raids in the future but I don't recall seeing you making any mention of the issue.  Good allies are the ones who take issues to public flame boards rather than trying to get the problem fixed in other ways right?  If you honestly thought you were screwed out of loot I would think that you would raise the issue earlier than a full week after it happened.<br>

<br>
Gaelron wrote &quot;we start moving in and they call a GM&quot;<br>
<br>
Not sure, but does this not mean that you started to move in on this group of 6 NP members? That you started to attack their mobs that where in the common vacinity of their camp and are considered Manor mobs by people that hunt in Kael.<br>
<br>
And you say they call a GM, which supports them in trying to work out with you on the situation. You put call a GM in the context like how dare they? Yet you invoked PnP, this seems like a very messy situation. From what I have heard you where in pushing your way into the Arena until Revisance said you where attacking their camped spawns, then after moving away from arena, you ran into the already camped and claimed spot of the Manor.<br>
<br>
As for this claim of Training, by a unknown person that you are not sure was a NP member but you want a apology anyway. Have you put much thought as you mentioned in your post<br>
<br>
Gaelron wrote : &quot;So we all move to manor and start pulling while we wait for late people&quot;<br>
 <br>
That pershaps these 4 mobs that where trained on you was one of your Late Raiders? <br>
<br>
You are trying to drag a Guild Rep through the mud, when you are not even sure of your own facts. I know Quellious Collective regulars are going to see this as such..<br>

Not again... Tribunal... not again.<br>

First CoA then FE and now NP?<br>
<br>
If you are going to accuse an entire guild of bad behavior, please offer some proof.  I am all for healthy ranting, relatively good-natured sparring, stupid jokes, warnings about idiots and jerks, general complaints, and bitching about Verant (even I enjoy that) but I am getting tired of so and so did this and everyone with the same tag above their heads is pond scum and deserve to be sucked into Inny's nostrils.  <br>
<br>
Consider for a moment that perhaps there was a misunderstanding and what happened was not intentional.  Tell your side of the story but make allowances for the other side too.  Go ahead and point out where a mistake was made.  Ask that it be corrected or not repeated.  But be careful how you do this or you are more likely to just get flamed in return.  Hell, pretty soon everyone is going to need better fire resist gear if this continues. <p>Juror<BR>

The difference here is that I provided 30 items as proof, I had talked to officers, members, and leaders of COA and they all had the same attitude and gave me the shoulder.  THAT is a big difference than Gaelron saying that NP was there and we saw someone train us so it must be their fault.<br>
<br>
Also, Gaelron, I talked to Sirinab lastnight about the issue WHILE it was happening, and.. she gave me a COMPLETELY different story.. I have logs if you so desire to hear it.<br>
<br>
BTW Gaelron, you posted this complaint at (10/4/01 7:29:32 am) and you cant provide logs because you formatted and re-installed your OS &quot;today&quot;.. JESUS! What time do you wake up!? <p><b>Stehe McNorn</b>~EQ

<br>
A crule sleep 'cross our land<br>
All withered and dying<br>
As they fall, the victems<br>
They're dying a sad death<br>
In our land, we lay down<br>
And suffer again<br>
<br>
A dark girl 'cross our land<br>
Is pacing, is preying<br>
And with her, a fever<br>
A marching black fever<br>
No eyes see, No features<br>
Just black form, suffering<br>
<br>
You have her sympathy<br>
You have her tears<br>
She tries only to take<br>
All your fears<br>
The pain she feels<br>
When she drinks your soul<br>
Is hers to suffer<br>
It is her toll<br>
Belive me, she's helpless<br>
When she curses your land<br>
When she swallows light<br>
Its not her hand<br>
<br>
Poison awaits when you kiss her<br>
Her heart cries out for you, for me<br>
Untold misery is hers to serve out for eternity<br>
Out cold. Mankind will stay forevermore if she gets her way<br>
She can't help it. Its her, her curse<br>
To sing your pain in her own curse<br>
<br>
She is the dark<br>
The nightmares you hide<br>
The pain you feel<br>
The suffering inside<br>
Though she was like you<br>
Through her dark past<br>
But now, the conqueror<br>
Her choirs vast<br>
Oh please forgive her<br>
As mankind dies<br>
As angels weep<br>
And heaven cries.<br>

Now on the other hand she can get out of line sometimes with trains and that banker killing incident. <br>
<br>
Secondly Dordaek, no we did not make any attempt to move into the arena, OUR ENTIRE GOAL IN KAEL WAS INSIDE THE MANOR. We only went to the manor to finish the 9th ring quest.<br>
<br>
I was there when my guild first started moving in, we did indeed get the ok from the NP group, we started pulling, they then accused us of &quot;stealing there camp&quot; and telling us to wait our turn. They petition'ed (nothing happened from that) and we moved in, I had to log shortly after that so I know thing about this training incident. <br>
<br>
There was another detail about this that hasn't even been mentioned yet, when just a few RIP members were there, one of the excellent shaman spears droped (11/19, no drop), NP had no shamans with them, so Sirinab kindly asked &quot;if you have no shamans for that spear we have a shaman that could use&quot;, they then procided to loot and destroy the spear for no reason. No this isn't breaking any rules (and even if we hadn't asked to move in, which we did and got a yes to, moving over someone elses camp isn't against the rules either) but it definitaly isn't a cool thing to do. This created a lot of hostility between the two guilds and made dealing with any of there &quot;stealing camp&quot; claims much harder to deal with.<br>
<br>
Oh, and anyone that wants logs of this, contact me, I'll send you my log file, trying to open it now (its like 50 mb so it'll take a while, heh). <p><font face="arial"><img src="http://server.counter-strike.net/images/gat.jpg" border=0 align=centre></font><br>
