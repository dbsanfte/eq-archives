It seems he had started a female character and when asked why he quite frankly admitted it was because guys give him stuff.  <br>
<br>
I can remember just a handful of times that some guy ran up to me and tried to give me something, and yes, all my chars are female.  At Christmas time I was in Gfay going to buff newbies like I always do when I go there and a paladin sent me a tell asking my what kind of head gear I had.  I had just sold off some armor to buy a weapon I wanted and had nothing.  He said he'd meet me at PoD lift and give me an old helm he had.  I offered to pay, but he just said naw he was cleaning out his bank.  He runs up puts a helm in trade screen and hits trade.  I hit trade and start to thank him.  He says Merry Christmas and camps.  I finish buffing little one and look at the helm, my new deepwater helm and almost fall over.  Whoever that was, thank you very much, btw.  Still using it.<br>
so I am aware that sometimes people give you things without you asking, flirting, hinting or whoring for them.  I give stuff away all the time and expect nothing in return except maybe a thanks instead of a complaint about it being crap.<br>
<br>
My next question to him was, why do they just give you things?  The answer was if you play nice with them the guys will bend over backwards giving you things or letting you loot things.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, you're really a guy, but you don't mind acting like a bitch in heat if someone will give you something.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;laugh  Nah, it's cool.  You should see some of the cool stuff I get.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, the holy knight rises up in me in righteous indignation.  &quot;Ok, so it's not bad enough that you have chars like Openmylegs, Whorinfer and Cyberfer who claim they are women, but happy to do whatever to get gear and plat and then brag about it to us dumb bunnies who are fighting for stuff.  At this point, I'll admit those names probably got changed fairly quickly by the GM's, unless maybe Obsidienx was behind one, and most likely they were really guys anyway.  <br>
<br>
To each his/her own, but I really do get irritated to see female chars out there whoring for loot, which makes some guys think we're all whoring for loot.  I'm not a prude and take a little kidding about the naked high elf, I'm used to that since I die a lot.  even though I be holy knight I do have a sense of humor about most things.  I do object to having someone point blank proposition me and they are usually in some pretty crude and graphic ways which makes me even madder.<br>
<br>
What does get me boiling hot is to have guys tell me straight out they start fem chars so they can get stuff.  Surely there has to be some lonely female chars out there who will support a good-looking barb or cute little wood elf or whatever and you can play the charming giggalo (sp).<br>
<br>
My former game fiancee and I used to get in arguments all the time because he wanted me to hurry and level up to him and he kept trying to give me armor and weapons and I didn't want him giving me stuff.  I'm not saying people shouldn't accept gifts.  I'm not as ouchy on the subject as I used to be, but then I give a lot of stuff away myself.  I do object to guys playing females just so they can con other guys out of stuff.  As stated before, I get irritated by females acting like whores, but it just seems worse when there's a guy behind the actions.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying a person shouldn't play an opposite sex char, just that to play a female only for the con aspect of it is disgusting.<br>
<br>
I did a cr for my son's ranger and brought him back to gfay once while he was in school so I got to see the other side one day.  Two guys are standing next to me on the docks waiting to catch the boat.  A cute little wood elf comes up and one guy says to me in tells, &quot;Get a load of that,&quot; and then proceeds to tell me what he'd like to do to her and asks me isn't that right.  Well, I don't want anyone knowing Mom is playing son's macho ranger so I lower my voice, chuckle and agree she's pretty hot.  To be honest, it feels uncomfortable for me to play a male char.<br>
<br>
Son later tells me not to play his chars unless it's an emergency because I snicker all the time, act like a girl and go around helping people and he doesn't want me giving anyone the wrong impression of his char.  He's also told me I don't have what it takes to play an evil char because I wouldn't enjoy pulling foot hairs off a halfling one-by-one, but that's another story.<br>
<br>
Point being, doesn't it seem strange to play a female char and flirt around with guys when you're a guy?  Is loot really that important in this game?  Is it any worse than the gals whoring for loot?   <br>
<br>
Just asking, venting, making a fool out of my holy knight self.<br>

I have chosen each character I have played based on the character model - my main is a half elf male because the female half elves looked crappier, my primary alt is a female troll warrior because she looked sooooo hideous.  I don't roleplay typically.<br>
<br>
As to items - my bank (in fact the banks on most of my mules) is loaded with items that I hate to sell to a merchant because they are good items, but that I cant sell because I either dont have time or the items dont have a lot of sale value.  I would say the items that give me the most trouble are class specific items.  Not many people play paladins or mages - so if I have a lore elemental binder from the Hole, or a bunch of loam from the hole (which has been overshadowed by netted kelp) or a paladin only weapon or armor, I frequently look for low levels in the zone where I am banking and send them a tell asking if they are new players and want a new item to play with.  My 25/54 5str/5sta 2hs might have no sale value at all, but it is worth the 5pp I can sell it to a merchant for to give it to a low level melee who can use the weapon effectively until they are 30th level.<br>
<br>
Deepwater helms are common - probably moreso than paladins at this point.  Your benefactor probably saw it in the bank and did / paladin 1 10, saw your name and saw an opportunity to clear bank space and be nice to a lower level character.  I know that most of the time I give items away, I don't even know the gender of the character until they show up - most EQ names are not clearly gender specific. Just remember that generosity and gender don't really go hand in hand most of the time - I got lots of free stuff (well, banded armor) as a male half elf ranger, but my female troll warrior was never given anything at low levels except by me.<br>

I do realize that people give things away for no reason other than to be nice.  the person giving me the helm had no idea what sex I was because he just sent me a tell and asked if I needed head gear so I do understand how giving things away works.<br>
<br>
My point is not whether people give things away or not.  I do that all the time.  <br>
<br>
My point is not whether a person plays the same sex, both sexes or opposite sex.  <br>
<br>
My problem is guys who play gals solely because they can get things by playing up to guys in the game.  Does this bother anyone else or am I just missing something?<br>
<br>
I do roleplay my chars, because that's the part of the game I most enjoy.  I can buy a computer game like Zelda if I just want to go kill stuff.<br>
<br>
Whether a person is roleplaying or not, doesn't it feel a little strange to be a guy playing up to another guy for loot?<br>
<br>
Just curious.<br>

Stuff like this makes me sick... but it all comes back to the old misunderstanding that people see the flirting, busty woodelf in leather, and think that the &quot;woman&quot; on the other side of the monitor is just as attractive... when in reality, most are either a bunch of teenage guys that jack off at their toons from the Char Select screen or else are women who use the beauty of their toons to get attention that their RL features would never attain.  <br>
<br>
And yep... I could name more than a few guys who use the sex of their toon to get them freebies that their pathetic skills could never hope to attain.<br>

IMO any male, regardless of age, stupid enough to fall for names like these deserves whatever he gets. He was looking for an illusion and he gets what he bargains (ahem) for. I remember a 20's Es sitting on the Nek log giving fine steel weapons away after my first trip to SolA. A female caster was trying her damndest to milk items off another caster. He (or she) picked up on it and soon enough he was dishing out insults, and I being I... well I joined in the fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uquasquetonfyrestrike.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quasqueton Fyrestrike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Road Kill Cabbie</span><br>  Posts: 339<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/10/02 10:20:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=390.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Free stuff</span><hr size=1> /lifts dress<br>

Verant has seen to it that most chars are at least moderately attractive, so I see no harm in choosing one.  However, I do have a problem with guys making female chars to milk other guys and making the rest of us females look like sluts.  We have enough slutty women doing that without your help.<br>

I have a male char, I flirt incessantly with Females in game <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
I have a whole page of hotkeys just for it.<br>
Of course, I also flirt with men as a man, oddly enough most go along with it for fun.<br>
Playing a male I get to hear all those convos in groups men dont get to when a woman is involved. Sadly most of the time its about EQ and class equallity .oO( zzZzzzz ) but every once in a while I get the good stuff <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Ya'll probably already know about this but there was very interesting study done on the psychology behind a lot the players of online games, and EQ was one that he worked with.  The link may still be on allakazam. One of the many areas he studies were gender-benders.  Seems the reason most males who play female characters do so for getting free stuff.  The reason most females who play male characters do so because they feel they are taken more seriously.<br>
<br>
I found it to be very interesting reading.  Covered a lot of topics.<br>
