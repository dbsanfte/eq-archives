<br>
I just have had hooked up DishNetWork System for my TV connecton and found out the hard way that they lied to me about what they broadcast.  I would like to cancel their services and go to Direct TV that has the NFL Ticket {I originally just wanted to see the San Diego Charger games and they told me if it is shown on the west coast I could get it.  This is unture and if you are told this, do not fall for it.  They can only show your LOCAL channels &lt;oh for a extra fee not metioned&gt; and if does not come on NATION wide TV or your LOCAL channels you can not get it}.<br>
<br>
So the question is, can I cancel without it being reported to the credit companies &lt;I am already in the process of cleaning up my credit, do not want to start again&gt; is there a cooling off period in place or am I stuck with this.  I do not have the $300 bucks they want to take for me to cancel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Also, i'm sure if you can prove they misrepresented themselves, you don't have to pay any fee. <br>
<br>
Go down to your local courthouse and hit the public law library. You might spend alot of time finding the law on it, but you should be able to find out something. <p><BR> <center><img src=http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/Phoenix/fullsize/ravenark_sig.jpg></center> <BR> <center> <a href=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/jerjawi/ravsig/ravwater.html target="web">Got Moo?</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucrucifermistmoore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crucifer Mistmoore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/29/02 2:40:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=991.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A question to the Lawyer out ther about</span><hr size=1> <br>
If they have your credit card info, you will get charged.  Getting your money back will require you to deal with their billing people, probably many times.  If anyone says they &quot;can't&quot; do it, immediately ask to speak to a supervisor.  Always get first and last names, and direct phone numbers when possible, when you get a new person on the phone.  Don't let them transfer you to a voice mailbox without immediately calling back and demanding to speak with the person who just gave you the blowoff.   Don't ever leave a message hoping you'll get a call back, because you won't.  <br>
<br>
They have your money, you've cancelled your service, they have no reason to want to keep you happy.  Eventually you'll get to someone who just doesn't want to deal with you, and doesn't have to answer to three levels of management just to issue you a refund.  That person will give you your money back.<br>
<br>
Or you can go pre-emptive on their asses.  Report your credit card stolen so your account number will change.  When they try to charge you, it will be declined.  When they send you a bill, ignore it.  When they send you collection notices, ignore them.  If they try to call you, tell them they have a wrong number.  Don't return their calls if they leave a message.<br>
<br>
Check your credit record in a year and it's 99% likely all their collection threats led to nothing.  Assuming you never gave them your Social Security Number (and there's no good reason to EVER give a private business your real SSN, except your employer and your health insurance provider) there's little they can do except take you to court, which just doesn't happen in the real world.  If it does, get a Pre-Paid Legal membership and you'll have an almost-free lawyer who will deal with them for you.  Hell, get really pre-emptive, get a membership now, and let the lawyer deal with it all for you.  <br>
<br>
I'm not a lawyer, but I've spent enough years in the customer service business to know how big corporations deal with their customers.  If it's easy to take your money, they'll take it and make you jump through hoops to get it back.  If it's not easy to get, they usually won't bother to do anything beyond their automated billing procedures, which usually end after a year of sending dishonest collection notices.<br>

<br>
If businesses submit credit card charges electronically, (And most do to avoid the standard 2% fee from the credit card company for submitting charges manually.) the charge shows up on your credit card within 24 hours and depending on the &quot;efficiency&quot; of the bank your credit card is with, the same day.<br>

This is what I thought too. Then I tried to cancel my never-used AOL. I called my bank and they basically said, short of closing my account, automated debits virtually always go through. <p><a><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22703"

Unfortunately, they do have my ssn.  To qualify to get the service you have to get a credit check.  Catch this, I was turned down for my employee discount because of the credit check, talking about sick puppies {no I do not work for them, my parent company owns them}.  <br>
<br>
My concern is solely the credit.  Long story short, I got screwed by a bank it domino'd into the cc cards and now I am in like my 3'rd year of the seven to get it off of it.  I do not want to start again.<br>
<br>
If there is a cooling off period, I can get out of it, if there is not, I am stuck.  The law that Ravenark mention has been adjusted, that I know.  It was a hoot while it lasted, but the ISP's of course got wise and fixed it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  hopefully it has not screwed me. <p><html>

Wouldn't it be lovely if they finally got us decent, cheap Cable tv here in the San Jose area? (Yes, I live here too) Fuggin' middle of Silicon Valley, and they can't get their crap together to get us decent internet OR tv access. I might as well be playing EQ on a stone tablet n' chisel. My apartment complex offers both broadband and Cable TV, yeah.....at a combined total of almost 300$ a month. *Boggle* God I love this town. You gotta pay 5 bucks just to wipe yer arse here.<br>
