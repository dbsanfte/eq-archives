<br>
The enchanter casually strolled along the decks of the Sky Hawk, a two masted schooner heading towards Freeport.  Desiring to keep her whereabouts and current activities obscured, she opted to travel under the guise of a half elven spice merchant named Raven Yadan.  The disguise not only prevented her from being beleaguered or attacked by the elves and dwarves who live on the continent, but it also served to mislead any potential rivals or enemies from ascertaining the reasons for her presence.  Forever pursuing knowledge, no matter how recondite or obscure, the enchanter's business in Faedwyr was recently concluded with the acquisition of a journal of some long forgotten thaumathurgy practices.<br>
<br>
As the Sky Hawk went underway, the enchanter noticed a wood elf standing near the ship's railing, readying a corded arrow into the short bow she held as she looked down at the waters.  <br>
<br>
  'Trust a wood elf to find a way to complicate something as simple-minded as fishing.'  The half elf watched as she fired the arrow into the water.  As it streaked downward, the cord unfurled to reveal it was tied to the railing and soon the ranger started to pull the cord up and reveal her catch.  A codfish was impaled upon the arrow.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You know, fishing is infinitely easier if you use a fishing pole and bait.&quot;  The half elf remarked as the ranger extracted her arrow and tossed her catch into a nearby basket.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes, but I don't have either with me right now.  And this is an alternative.&quot;  The wood elf turned to the speaker and instantly the incognito enchanter recognized her.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ranger.&quot;  The half elf spoke half question, half statement.  The Feir` Dal nodded in affirmation and turned to get a better look at the individual.  The silver haired half elf was nearly six feet tall, steel grey eyes were hidden behind a pair of gold wire-rimmed spectacles.  And despite the fact that she was dressed in a silk wayfarer's chemise and loose fitting trousers, her mannerisms seemed to indicate to the ranger that the half elf was less at home aboard a ship than a mansion in some large city.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Millikin Erreene.&quot;  The ranger set aside her bow and extended her hand in greeting.  For her own part, the half elf adjusted the spectacles she was wearing and glanced at the offered hand with a measured pause before taking the hand in greeting -- just long enough to be polite.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Raven Yadan.&quot;  She responded, smiling faintly to the ranger, wiping her hand on a handkerchief she had removed from a pocket.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;A pleasure.&quot;  Millikin turned to pick up her bow, hiding a faint smile at the display of snobbery.  &quot;Did you lose your book or something?&quot;  She readied another arrow.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Excuse me?&quot;  Raven asked in a quizzical tone.  'How could she know about the journal?'  Instantly she studied Millikin in mild suspicion, masked as curiosity.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The reading spectacles.&quot;   The ranger indicated with a slight gesture.  Something caught Raven's attention as Millikin turned back to the water.  The medicine pouch worn around the ranger's neck possessed an eldritch power that called to the enchanter.  This was not one of the myriad druidic talismans rangers and others of her ilk typically carried.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The spectacles.  No.&quot;  Raven responded.  &quot;They simply help me to see better.  What is that you're wearing around your neck?  I've never seen that before.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;It's a medicine pouch.  It's used to hold spell components and similar objects.&quot;  Millikin replied, studying the water.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Is that what yours possesses?&quot;  Raven's question seemed innocuous enough, but something about it gave Millikin pause.  'Why would it suddenly be of interest to someone who barely deigned to shake hands earlier?'<br>
<br>
  &quot;No.  It carries an object I intend to give to someone else.&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &quot;What sort of object?&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &quot;Something I obtained a while ago.&quot;  Millikin fired another arrow, this time intentionally missing her target.  No other information was forthcoming.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Better luck next time, I suppose.&quot;  Raven remarked, smiling faintly to her once again.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Perhaps.&quot;  Millikin retrieved the arrow then tucked the pouch underneath her tunic before resuming her bow fishing.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Good day to you then, Millikin Erreene.&quot;  Raven turned to leave, knowing she may have better luck with the ranger at a later time.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Good afternoon, Ms. Yadan.&quot;  Millikin replied, watching the half elf depart from the corner of her eye.  'Why did she have the feeling she knew her from somewhere?'<br>

<br>
Shiobahn Fyrestrike (formerly Goldbrooke) sat quietly upon a small blanket by the lakeside in her home town.  Above her loomed the guilds of the magical arts, her own designation included amongst them, and every so often she could hear the workings of different defensive spells coming from above.  Her momentary solitude was dedicated to toying with a pouch of runes, identifying each of the marks upon them to further her research for greater spells.  Quasqueton had promised her even greater runes when he returned back from his quest, but the days seemed to grow longer and longer in his absence.  It was in this moment of study and reflection that she distinctly heard the soft footfalls of the sure-footed ranger approaching her.<br>
<br>
A smile crept across the delicately defined high Elven face as she let the initial shock of the visit wear away, and Shio rose to her feet.  She stood taller than the ranger, though her frame more willowy, and her hair was quite obviously flame kissed by her deity of the arts, Solusek Ro, whom she called upon for the power of her spells.  She reached out her hands to the ranger as she spoke softly in the language of the elves "Creoso eska, tinu en'Tunare.  It is good to see you home cousin."  Millikin gripped her hands in return though her present mood was unreadable, as often it was, by her kin.  "Diol'lle, Shiobahn.  It is good to return once again."<br>
<br>
Shiobahn studied her a moment, certain there was a tale to be told, but not knowing when the ranger would tell it, if she decided to speak of it at all.  "We shall catch up over a glass of Elven wine.  The day is still early and the tavern is open across town.  Just allow me to pack my things."  Shio did not offer much room for argument, though then she rarely did.  She quickly bent down to retrieve her runes, pouring them back into a small pouch that hung from her belt.  She carried a small myriad of trinkets this way, including a finely crafted golden bowl bearing a few small dings in the bottom which hinted at the fact she was not afraid to swing it at something if one of her spells was going awry, no matter how futile the attempt was.  Tucking her blanket into a backpack she then set off on foot along side her cousin to the tavern.<br>
<br>

Felwith - Northern District<br>
<br>
A glass of Elven wine and a treat of a small fruit tart later the two sat together in an out of the way corner of the bar.  It was an enjoyable time filled with tales of adventure, many of Millikin's taking place in the frozen lands of Velious which intrigued Shio and much of Shio's having taken place another great distance away, in the newly explored moon of Luclin.  It was Millikin's comments of the wastelands in the far west reaches of the frozen continent that perked Shio's attention.  "Cousin, why have you come home from such great adventures?  And have you heard word of a Quasqueton?  He has been in those far reaching lands for some time up to now under quest of the Coldain.  I know he is allied to the dragon beasts that survive out there, but he has not sent word recently and I worry.  The last I knew he had enlisted the aid of the Troubadour Autumnwyld, but it is still a harsh land for wizard and bard alone."<br>
<br>
She quickly saw the look of recognition in Millikin's eyes as she uttered the names, and a look of hope appeared upon her face.  She felt the matter bore further explanation and she quickly added in "Quas and I were bound together just this spring in a quiet ceremony under Ro's watchful eye.  It is a difficult balance some days, love and magic.  We did not make a spectacle of our union, I am sorry to have not informed you but it is nearly impossible to track the tracker." <br>

Had she heard of Quasqueton? Of course she had. Her thoughts momentarily turned to her initial meeting with him. Autumn had invited her to venture into Charasis, the Howling Stones with some of her recent adventuring companions. The purpose of the foray into the tomb of the late Drusilla Sathir was for archaeological reasons: Quasqueton wished to complete a set of Kylong armor and had spent considerable time gathering up the different pieces of armor once worn by the Iksar tribe.<br>
<br>
He had seemed a bit unconventional, to say the least. Instead of wielding magic with the calculating efficiency of Valdayana D`Varr or passionate devotion of Saldaria Snowspirit, Quasqueton blithely hurled lightning or fire at the walking dead or golem sentries that protected the place as if he were playing a game of catch. Eventually they obtained the final piece of armor for his collection, a chainmail tunic. Millikin had been surprised that the enchantment placed on by its iksar creators granting the wearer enhanced strength had remained in tact despite the onslaught of magic and melee required to destroy the iksar skeletal remains that had been wearing it.<br>
<br>
She had met him subsequently a few more times, once in the Umbral Plains, but more commonly in Velious. During a Coldain assault on the Ry`Gorr fort, a gem mining expedition in the Siren's Grotto, and once while exploring the Dragon Necropolis. Millikin snapped out of her mental reverie as Shiobahn explained that they had been married recently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I do know him. I've met him and adventured with him, the last time was while in Velious.&quot; Millikin rubbed the back of her neck, idly wondering how such a detail could have been forgotten to have been mentioned by her parents or her sister in their correspondence. Then it occurred to her that even they may not know. Acting on spontaneous impulse was a common trait, particularly in the Goldbrooke family and Millikin could not honestly say she always acted only after careful deliberation.<br>
<br>
Nor could she exactly sum up her feelings on hearing the news except that she somehow expected it to come back and haunt her. Somehow. Millikin reached for the black medicine pouch she was wearing around her neck to make sure it was still there as she downed the last of her wine then took a deep breath, hoping her offer wouldn't turn out to be more than she bargained for.<br>
<br>
&quot;It appears my list of errands for arcanists is expanding. Did you have a message you wanted me to deliver to him?&quot; <br>
