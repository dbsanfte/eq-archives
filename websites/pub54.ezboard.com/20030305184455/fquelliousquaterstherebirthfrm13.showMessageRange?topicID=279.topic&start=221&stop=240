<br>
I have read this shiot over and over trying to make reasoning out of the blabble. BUT DAMN this is getting stupid. Same reason I turn ooc and shouts off in game.<br>
<br>
Now everyone in this game has had a bad experience with someone/folks.....hense the someONE or some FOLKS. Shiot I had a prob with SOME FOLKS in Karnor's a while back. All of them in the same guild 'cept for a few others in another guild. And yeah when I did a who all on the guilds they was the only ones online at that time and I B#tch fested them. BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I DO NOT hold thier actions against the others in that guild that I have had the pleasure of meeting. INSTEAD ........ I wrote the names in my BLACK LIST book and may the gods of Everquest help them if they need help badly and I am the only option&lt;only xlocer in hate/fear/bad areas you cant get out without one&gt; I hope and pray you have one hefty @$$ bank account.Even at that I still would probly say well damn guess you should have watched what mud holes you played in earlier in game and leave your @$$ sittin there. <br>
<br>
But now lets say your guildie logs in and they arent in my book and need an xloc out/help whathave you. OF COURSE I WILL!!! You have never done anything offensive to me or my comrades&lt;guild or not&gt; so of course I will help you in any way i can. <br>
<br>
Now I know a few folks in ADD and they are some awesome folks&lt;I know for a fact they wasn't there that day&gt;. I know folks in a plenty guilds where one or a few of their guildies have really peeved me off. But I WILL NOT blast those I know to be awesome people/players in said guild.Or those that I don't know at all even.<br>
<br>
Now those ADD's that were in fear that day YEAH you are wrong. I mean come on... if you had broke in and killed all that crap off and had the massive CR's and had already told folks this is why we are here and someone came in and took what you was there for away from you you would be the flamers. I know I would. It is just plain and simple as this ...... MORALS. Just because some VAIGE rule states and makes it so called ok in GAME does not mean it is right. Manson thought he was right too. So did 'ol dude in Wacko. But where they ? 99 percent of humanity said they wasn't. So therefore they in everyone's eyes where wrong. This is what everyone is so peeved about. Not this that or the other thats been getting knocked back and forth here in this board. The only thing I can see from the boards that peeved folks off was the fact that YOUR RAID LEADER KNEW that the SHIZZAR was ALREADY being cleared to for MAEVE BEFORE you all entered.NOW maybe he didnt tell you . Maybe he said &quot;They knew we was coming here so they came here b4 we could get here.&quot; But clearly this was NOT the case. YOUR raid leader KNEW FULL WELL that others were ALREADY in FEAR AND CLEARING TO GET TO THE SHIZZ BEFORE he organized everyone and went in. BOTTOM LINE.<br>
<br>
LET IT GO. There is no way in hell that MORALLY you can justify that. <br>
<br>
Verant can make all the rules they want but WE are what makes our server. NOT VERANT. If we want a loving community by george WE CAN HAVE IT!!!! No rule says we can't. No rule say's we HAVE to fight bicker and mame. WE THE PLAYERS is what makes Quellious good or bad. Me personally I want a good server something I can log in and  feel relieved of the RL preassures from the day . <br>
<br>
WE CAN HAVE A GREAT COMMUNITY/SERVER . IT IS UP TO US AND US ALONE. <br>
<br>
You know what if everyone that played EQ went on strike Verant would bend over backwards to make shiot the way WE THE CONSUMER WANT IT.<br>
<br>
I have never ever posted on this board b4. Maeve has been a comrade of mine since 2000. I have others I have been <br>
comrades with since Feb this year but I would stand up for them as well just like I would Maeve. Even if I didn't know you at all I would come to your aid if you needed me to. But NOT if you are in my BOOK. I would help you even if one or 20 of your guildies was in my book cause you arent in the book. This way &lt;hopefully&gt; those lowly few that aren't even good enough to scrub my toilets with thier tongue's may leave Quellious and never come back. But that's a big dream I know . But Oh well at least there is no way in hell they ever gonna bother me. I just ignore thier @$$'s. Problem solved. So if we as a comunity stick together and keep on being our nice loving caring selves and just flat ignore&lt;as if they dont even exist&gt; those careless thoughtless unfeeling folks out there that maybe they will just get sick of it and leave.<br>
<br>
Summerized........ The folks in Fear that day that took that spawn ARE WRONG PERIOD. I am sure that not all of ADD was there that day therefore I would never flame anyone that wasnt even there . It just wouldn't be fair to those that didn't uphold the low lives. SOOOO ....<br>
<br>
&lt;replacing the ADD thing thats been rabid on the board&gt; YOU LOWLY FOLKS THAT WENT IN FEAR KNOWING SOMEONE WAS ALREADY THERE FOR THE SAID NPC ........ GET STUCK NEEDING ME OR SOMEONE ELSE YOU PEEVED OFF WITH YOUR ACTIONS&gt; I just hope I am there to see it.<br>
<br>
And Qin ...... /e smile. You are truely someone that was a victim of sort as well. Sorry you had to go thro that BS cause of a few dumb@$$es. I forgot to mention it b4 I ranted the joker that caused the fiasco. *huggles* and /bonks Allissiya. <br>

<br>
Now my responses to people flaming ADD. If you weren't there, you don't know. Perception is a key issue here. Does the bad guy know he is the bad guy, or just fighting for what he believes? Well, let me tell you what I believe ( me being the main bad guy, since the epic piece was for me )<br>
<br>
I believe banelion. A very good person, I believe him 100 percent that he attempted to negotiate. I believe we waited for the negotiations to determine how to proceed.<br>
I believe that, in the greater picture, we were not wrong for moving into fear.<br>
<br>
I joined radiant and friends on a fear clearing, after the fact, to help tide things over, and show that ADD are not bad people. I am the one making the decision to give the head of the serpent over to maeve, even though I have the full backing of my guild &lt; whom all support me in this, despite their individual personal views on the issue &gt;. A few things did bother me about some of the flame posts about ADD. I know we have a bad rep, however we do not deserve the baby killer logo or a scarlet letter stamped on our foreheads. EVERYONE in this game has made someone mad, every last one of you who have touched EQ. Should you point fingers?<br>
In my attempt for peace, while visiting the fear raid radiant had going I made note of a few things. Now, don't get me wrong, I wasn't spying, but in light of some of your comments, I feel these things stand out.<br>
Allissiya, I am going to use your post, since you are at the end of the list and frankly the only one I can even remotely remember at this late hour.<br>
<br>
On the day in question, I checked to see if the shissar was up as soon as I logged in. It was not. I went about the usual order of things after, grouping with friends and such, when verbo &lt; as his alter &gt; informed the guild that the shissar had popped. I was at the fear portal 5-10 min. later. This was early in the morning, and I tried to setup a raid from all the friends I had online at the time. I didn't have enough of the right classes for a clearing, so I sat there as the drybones danced at the portal thinking how to proceed. My likely course was to wait until more ADD logged on. Then radiant moved into the zone. Not many, but a few. But then they went in. This was a bit puzzling to me, why they would go in with so few. The answer? They knew I was there waiting on the Shissar. My guild knew right away that they were there because I told them. They entered the dangerous zone to get a drop on us. I do not blame them for that, I would have done the same, had I wanted to risk my friends exp bars over getting to a camp for me in time. I did not want to risk it. Not my friends, not anyones.<br>
<br>
Radiant, on the raid I joined, had quite a few in the zone. Why did they not only have 10 or 15 in zone like they did before? I don't know, you have to ask them. I bet they would say it was to clear fear so the shissar would be easier to get. So why rush in it the day before?<br>
That supports my thoughts that they wanted to get in to &quot; claim &quot; the spawn.<br>
<br>
So, they knew we were there. We knew they were there. What happens next? A race. I think most guilds would have raced to it, had they heard me over guild chat nagging play by play, even just to shut me up. So there you have it, two guilds running to the finish line.<br>
<br>
To those of you who say we should not have been in a zone that they had cleared attempting to take their spawn, I have this to say: How much of fear could have been cleared by a force of not even twenty in a small time of two hours including a few wipe outs? With rez time included?<br>
<br>
Don't act like they had everything killed BUT the temple people. That wasn't anywhere near accurate. If the zone had been decently cleared, we wouldn't have had to engage the 8-14 mobs as we entered. Nor would we have had to pull twice to clear a path to the temple. THE ZONE WAS NOT CLEARED. A few mobs were, no doubt, but not enough for you preachers out there to call us evil for entering the zone that they worked so hard to clear to KS a mob that had not been engaged.<br>
********** still a race *******************<br>
<br>
I also believe verbo when he says he singled the shissar. you call me naive? I also saw him ( with my own eyes ) single pull inny out of his spot in hate. He singled a god, so yes, I 100 percent back his call that he singled the shissar. I wasn't in the temple with him, but if he told me he could pull a rabbit from CT's toenail, then you damn skippy I would believe him. I am not ignorant, I just believe any friend that has pulled me out of danger and risked his exp bar many times to save my butt.<br>
/salute verbo<br>
/kneel verbo<br>
<br>
So now let me tell you about a fact &lt; not something I am taking on faith, or by word of mouth &gt;.<br>
<br>
Tristadorn DID train us. 100 percent fact. I watched him as he did it, thinking he was an ADD member who had gone off the deep end running around fear like an idiot. I targeted him, and after saw who he was, prepared for what I knew was coming. I mezzed many mobs that he had incoming to our camp, but even though I believe I am a good mezzer, there were just too many. Do two wrongs make a right? In judgement, officers may err, but a leader should never act as he did. I respect Radiant, but I could live on a server without you trist. You killed my friends.<br>
<br>
So why am I giving the shissar to Maeve? I have more info than most of you because I requested it from verant. They say mob is ours. Radiant was in zone with enough to attempt the shissar, but they didn't get a chance. That is why I am giving it to maeve. If she were a bad person, I may not have. Most of us chanters tend to know one another, by way of reputation or hearsay from friends. I have heard of maeve, and I know she is a nice deserving person. It did help my decision. I am certainly not doing it because I am losing sleep ( that cracks me up Kroud ) because the only thing we even remotely did wrong, was not let them have first shot. <br>
To you flamers, put that on me in the first place. I was the one who wanted it that bad.<br>
<br>
So, in summary:<br>
/salute Radiant<br>
/rude tristadorn<br>
<br>
/respect-and-love ADD, to all those that back me, back each other, and work as a team.<br>
<br>
/watchyourback to those who would harm my friends, whatever tag they wear above their heads.<br>

One group can go into fear and clear it. <br>
<br>
Why were there so many in Fear the following days/times? Cause folks got peeved that is why . AND alot of folks that posted to attend the raid for said weekend could not make it till friday day/eve at best. <br>
<br>
I lknow a many of folks that go in fear and exp group &lt;6 folks max&gt; all the time. Shoot there is a 60 cleric that camps in there and solo's. Bards can solo fear if camped inside prior. So yes 2 groups could more than likely clear zone if of sufficiant levels. Shoot seen 2 groups in WW all the time exp'ing on the iceburrowers and they are level 60 mobs. Just as I have seen 8 players take out the VS spawn. <br>
<br>
And from personal exp. I sat in Kedge for hours on top of hours waiting on Phinny .... he pops I have like 4 people. Folks come in they want Phinny ... they respectfully asked me if I was getting more to come ... I honestly told them no they arent even online yet. They said well can we kill him? I said might as well . No problems. I had other instances where they<br>
came in had full force and thier scout told them I was there since the early morning &lt;4 am MST&gt; and it was I would say 2 PM MST. They asked if I was camping him I said yes but I dont have anyone yet to come and they left. I even told them go ahead noone is online that I know . They said no you been there forever no. What i am getting at is this ........... If someone is in a zone i dont care how long I sat there waiting on it to pop and they have enough folks there to kill it I will by all rights Help them kill it and just sit there and wait again to see if I may get the chance to get my NPC next time. I have kiled VS more times than I can count &lt; last item I need BTW &gt; and wouldnt even ask to roll for it and if asked if I wanted to said no. WHY?? Cause they was there with the folks to kill it first. So what if i sat there for 4 months waiting on my chance to be there when it spawned first. I did not have folks there to take it. So therefore it is not my place to gripe or complain nor even ask to roll. <br>
<br>
I can hear the words of &quot;opinions are like assholes ...&quot; And your right. This is only my opinion and therefore this is how I run my EQ life. Does this mean i lack ubber gear ? YES. Does this mean I have waited over a year for my epic after I have started it ? Yes. Does this mean I care if I have or not ? Yes. I aint saying it feels good to sit there all that time just to not get the item cause it doesnt . I am just saying that Why would I think I woud have any right to it merly because I sat there for days waiting . I was there but they had force and was there first . Not my NPC anymore. Is theirs. One day maybe I will get asked to go help a wizzy get theirs and it be they just wanted me there so i could get it since I helped them whenever I was in the zone. Ya never know. But I do know one thing..... I have WAY LESS enemies than I do comrades. Maybe 5 percent of the folks I have encountered have ended up being folks I just dont care for and more than likely the feeling is mutual. And the other 95 percent I have meet have been pleasant to meet and some have become really good friends. <br>
<br>
When things like this happen it makes the game not so fun and makes getting your epic &lt; since that is what the topic pertains to&gt; even less fun. When I get my item for my epic I wanna party i wanna have fun I wanna hear cheers. Not this.Hense that is why I live my EQ life the way I do. <br>
<br>
And I am sorry if anyone falls onto anyone's black list but I firmly believe that folks get that by their own actions. Not cause someone else caused it.So like I said b4 if you on list you on list. No skin off anyones nose. What does the person that got on list care anyhoo? Obviously when they got on the list to begin with they wasnt too worried about it.<br>
<br>
The only time I camped something and got peeved off was that day in Karnor's. I had force was there and had been there clearing while another bunch was at zone in gathering. They rushed past me and mine and rushed VS room and after our camped cleric rezzed thiers and everyone got back up and buffed i was under an impression of lets just help each other. Even tho i was there and had force i was willing why not lets have fun . I cant stand bitching. But to rush past us when you knew we was already there andin force and take that NPC was wrong IN MY EYES. And a buncha others from the flood of tell's I recieved . Those folks got on alot of lists that night. And of course they probly blame it on me. i don't rightly care if they do. I know cause of what they did is why they are on those lists.<br>

I remember seeing Neomorpheous a couple other times in the last year or so tagged into ADD... I dunno, he was the one who was in camp with us after we broke into fear and what I assumed was the scout you all were talking about.<br>

You would have to ask Verbo if that was his char or not, I didnt know that it was untill I saw that his EZ board name was also Neomorphious.<br>

I spent a FULL hour speaking to him about this incident and I am satisfied that his actions were justified.  <br>
<br>
However, rather than talking about the 'incident' I would like to talk about 'people'  <br>
<br>
Garaddor - I have known Garaddor a long time.  Way back before Kunark was released I was introduced to him via Banelion.  He was(is)an excellent tradesperson and I always seek his advice on the value of items in general.  On a person basis, Garaddor is very much goal driven, he makes his own and his guild goals persues them and strives to build on what he already has. <br>
<br>
ADD are one of the older guilds on the server and Garaddor has maintained his commitment to his guild.  <br>
<br>
As a person Garaddor is quite amiciable, but he has a short temper and can be quite defensive and offensive should the situation suggest.  <br>
<br>
He has been attacked, he has defended his guild and attacked the people who went on the offensive with him.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes he can be a little rash, but otherwise he's a great guy.  <br>
<br>
Tristadorn - He is notorious on this server and is one of the oldest players.  <br>
<br>
Having upset MANY of our female counterparts on the server, including some of my friends - he continues to build a negative reputation for himself.  For this very reason, I have avoided him at all costs .. I have never grouped with him, even though he has been on the server as long as me.  <br>
<br>
Some of his comments, which I grant are passeed from the people that I have spoken with are utterly disgusting and do not warrant a repeat for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
There was in fact a time (when QQ was still about) that Tristadorn actually had a ban on him from various players in Quellious because of his overall attitude.  Very few people had acquired this status, but it would seem that Tristadorn was at the top of the list in terms of notoriorty (sp?). <br>
<br>
Banelion - As I have previously stated, I spent 1 hour talking through the whole situation with Banelion.  He knows all too well that I would not condone a KS, Camp Steal, Epic Steal call it what you may.  <br>
<br>
Banelion would DEFINITELY do nothing to impinge on our friendship and he also lives by a code of friendly conduct on Quellious as a whole as I do<br>
<br>
As a friend, he is loyal, he is reasonable, he is not a loot whore, he makes a good leader, hes very knowledgable about the game and we work well together on a grouping front. <br>
<br>
Anyone who has a go at Banelion without knowing the full facts are being unfair, untruthful and entirely incorrect.<br>
<br>
Whilst there are nicer people on the server, there is no more honourable person than Banelion on the server imho.  <br>
<br>
Mauve - I cannot comment on Mauve because I have had no direct involvement with him/her.  All I can offer is my condolences, because you have been the person affected as a direct result of this incident.<br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
<br>
Well after several hours discussion both internal to ADD, internal to DOSG and external to both guilds ... I am satisfied that wherever the fault lies ... does definitely not lie with Banelion and Garaddor.  We all know that Tristadorn is a @#%$ stirrer (or for those of you that dont he is I assure you).  <br>
<br>
This is not to say that ADD have the perfect guild.  There are people in that guild (probably moreso than any other guild) that are idiots.  I have warned both Garaddor and Banelion in the past that this was the case and they have acted to it to some degree.  But like all other guilds, we all have em.  <br>

<br>
Ral, known u a long time, thanks for sticking up for Bane. People seem to actually listen to you over Banelion on this board so maybe u can kick some sense into them.<br>

Look i can agree that ADD has some fine fine people. <br>
<br>
 But verbo is not one. it was verbo who most obviously lied through this entire thread. and it was verbo who flat out contradicted bippity. but it was also verbo who has the people involved backing verbo 100%.  but it was also verbo that was feeding alot of the ground info on what was pulled and who was where to your guild leader (by guild leaders admission).  so here we have this officer of questionable character after the fact being instrumental to ADDs actions in the course of the day.  it was verbo who joined the group me and bipp were in in north camp before all this happened announcing what an ass tristadorn can be to a radiant guildee.   hes slimey from what i can tell.<br>
<br>
so why wont i let it go? cause it hasnt been let go by anyone else.  other then a few people actions and words on the server are hardly peaceful.  i have to deal with this.  <br>
<br>
i mean qin says he believes verbo 100% (not so many words). i say i believe bippity 100%.  we struggled for a bit over plausibility but our core biased never goes away.  so thats that.  your not going to believe me. i know your not.  im just filing my complaint.  you wont believe the first ones: nobody ever does.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uqutsemnie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/15/02 10:49:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=239>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:  Character Analysis.........</span><hr size=1> And further to the nature of the teneciaty on my part. continuing from above.<br>
<br>
Look this thread goes directly to my personal relationships spread out over a few different guilds. Its not so much the general publics opinion that im concerned with, but the opinions possesed by those all already have relationships with.  Thats why in the above you see &quot;i believe bippity 100%&quot; and not &quot;i believe tristadorn 100%&quot; not at all that i dont believe tristadorn, but the people that im most concerned about reading this thread are typically very close to bippity in some way.  They will believe her. <br>
<br>
So the source of my teneciaty is my personal relationships.  Verbos lies wont be allowed to screw them up as long as i can help it.<br>

<br>
While I appreciate Raluvins remarks regarding my demeanor, I still will protect my guild with ferocity. When we get attacked the first reaction is to lash out. Which I did, but in no way shape or form do I apologize for my comments or statements.<br>
<br>
I protect my own because quite frankly, all of you seem to live by some dreamy ideals for any online game. This server like alot of them have been turned into nothing but competitive crap. <br>
<br>
The epics have turned alot of us into competitive boobs with most times resulting into crap like this. Some have chosen to wait on their epics for this reason , while others forge ahead and try to complete their quests. Nobody is right or wrong in this situation, but rather its all in the style of game you play.<br>
<br>
Being a very very old member on this server- June 1999 or thereabouts, I have seen much change in the way the game was and what it has become. While some is good , alot just plain stinks. I hate being a prick, but I will defend not only my guild but any personal attack against me or my friends.<br>
<br>
Belhaven, my dear old friend (sic), once asked me to take a stand so long ago, with regards to the FFA issue, and VM on the server. They , at the time, were the dominant force on Quellious, so we and the majority of the server had to contend with them. Well Belhaven, here is my stand. I will do whatever it takes short of something illegal to ensure the advancement of my guild and my friends. <br>
<br>
Seeing that I wasn't even online when all this crap happened, I still went to bat for my guild. Now I am not directing anything at Belhaven, but i just wanted to make my feelings known to the general populace (also I can't help but give him a poke in the ribs now and then to remind him I am still here and so is ADD...LOL).<br>
<br>
Lastly, to the rest of this board community, seeing that Qindien for now, is making his own decision regarding this matter, then I salute him for having the intestinal fortitude to bite the bullet on this.<br>
<br>
But, and this is a big but, what happened to the flames against Tristadorn and his training tactics. I have heard so many flame the two wrongs dont make a right thing, but no response is given toward his grievous actions. Maybe some are just tired of this thread, and are not even paying attention to the remaining posts on this, shrug....who knows but I for one find his behavior reprehensible, and he is their guild leader for petesakes. <br>
<br>
But go ahead point all the fingers you want, call ADD names, and drag my name through the mud, it matters not. ADD is still here and getting stronger, and I don't think we are going anywhere soon. <br>
<br>
Remember folks, let he  who is without sin cast the first stone. I am sure you can quote a bunch of other stuff back to me, but remember I am sure all of you have had times when you stepped on some toes, either on purpose or by accident, either way...before you start screaming your heads off and listening to drivel, talk to the parties involved. This should have been in a discussion section of this board, not in the flame portion. I only ran with what ammunition you and the rest of this board fed me and mine. <p>Garaddor Ghoulbane
