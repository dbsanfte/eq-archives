When people stop sending me recruit tells asking if I can tag along on their raid just to help out in case they are going to wipe then I would say do it. It is a very good skill and lets face it, it is fun. All you ppl wining about nerfing MB are probably the aholes that always say we don't need a wizard in a group. You have no clue what it takes to get to the point where you can actually cast MB much less one that actually does some damage. We have never run over another raid trying to beat a small raid to a dragon or VS and as long as I am part of the crew that goes after a target we won't. I believe this is the general attitude of each one of the MB wizzards I converse with regularly. We ALL help out small raids to try and guarantee them a victory. I have helped out at least 3 raids on Gore where they couldn't get her past 50% so the 2 wizards could finish her off. There are lots of raids like that and they usually end up, &quot;could you just find a few more wizards and kill her for us? We just want the scale for our bard&quot;. When you find the skill abused let me know and don't just have penis/class envy when you tell me. Bring something important. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ublaloceanos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blal Oceanos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 85<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/14/02 10:02:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=323.topic&index=203>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This may touch some nerves, but WTF lets see what happen</span><hr size=1> going off the topic onto the VM spell prices, they tried to sell me Descession and Spellshield for 9k each.

<br>
Bollucks. That's crap and you know it.<br>
<br>
With the exception of VS all these mobs have well known strats to beat them, which is just to say the same tired old MT strategy painted with the resist color of the day.<br>
<br>
And pull strat? You mean the puller must know not to damage the Gore? That's a strat?<br>
<br>
Pretty soon the strategy to beat the new VS will become commonly known as well, if it's not already.<br>
<br>
Yeah it's a pain to herd 20-30 mid to low fifties but that's not strategy either, that's just patience.<br>
<br>
I've pointed this out before but I think it bears repeating. Someone with 24 AA has enough experience to have gotten level 60 five more times. Think of these people as level 65+ toons. Yes they are powerful. That's the POINT of AA.<br>
<br>
I promise you it does not take two groups of 30+ AA toons to kill gore no matter what the class.<br>
<br>
It is certainly more convenient for 5 MB Wizzies and 1 druid (to track and pull) to get to DL, true, since they can all port.<br>
<br>
But skill? On a gore raid? It's been a long time since it took skill to kill gore. It's a factor of (levels^2)*numbers&gt;X and finding Gore on a list of resists. The higher level the less you need. The more AA the less you need.<br>
<br>
MB Wizzies can GET there easier. But if they fail well that's it. If a regular raid fails, no matter the size.. they just rez and try again.<br>
<br>
This is just low levels complaining of high levels 'farming' that has been going on since forever. They are killing something you want so you don't like it.<br>
<br>
No one cares if they get together and burn a PoD.<br>
<br>
This isn't a 'balance' issue at all.<br>
<br>
The only difference is that (at least on quellious that I know of) no burn team has ever displaced a regular raid trying to kill a kunark boss. Burn teams frequently do give epic pieces gratis to people who need them. (and yes sometimes, if there is no one that needs it on hand they keep it and sell it later.. how <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> greedy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) Burn teams do frequently save the day on a raid that has failed repeatedly and given up. I am certainly not saying burn teams are altruistic do gooders that go around playing santa all the time. But they do play santa sometimes. And they do make some pp sometimes.<br>
<br>
But it's not like they are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Druids</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or anything :P<br>
<br>
FK<br>
<br>
PS just kidding on the Druid thing.. some of my best friends are druids.. though I wouldn't want my sister to marry one.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Well, first off I don't blame any wizzies for taking advantage of MB, hell I know I would, I was dissapointed when the instant-refresh on rampage was nerfed RIGHT when I first got the skill -- *shrug*<br>
<br>
MB is obviously imbalanced in situations like Kunark dragons (to say nothing of Sontalak!).   Comparing a one click 5 man pickup group to a dragon raid is silly.<br>
<br>
True if Vis or Lotus or Wraith decided they wanted to stay on top of the kunark dragon spawns and kill them asap whenever they saw them up they could do so much the same as the MB wizzies do... my question is WHY don't they?   Because it's not worth the time to mobilize the troops for the most part, the loot is cash funds/twink stuff at that level, those dragons are designed to be raids FOR the guilds that aren't doing AoW, Ssra, Ntov ect ect.<br>
<br>
It's not that the MB wizzies are evil and are running over the poor midlevel raiders... just that the dragons are so trivialized both in risk and EFFORT that the chance of the midlevel guilds seeing a dragon up long enough to do a raid on them is cut down to a bare minimum.  As more MB wizzies come into play it will be down to pretty much nil.<br>
<br>
Guilds tend not to bottom-feed because even tho the mobs end up trivialized you don't get 20+ people mobilized for twink loot, not on any kind of regular basis.   People, individuals and small gruops bottom-feed all the time.  Farming tradeskills, pp, getting easy xp grinds, twinking, we all do it.   Turning these dragons into easy bottom-feeds for single groups is imbalancing.  It's unfair to folks that are at the level of honestly working for their epics and such.  At the same time, trying to be upset at the MB wizards is hypocritical.  We'd all do the same thing if we could, we *do* it on a much smaller scale....<br>
<br>
It's just a matter of time before enough MB wizzies are around that it gets 'nerfed' somehow.... probably (well, most logically) will simply be making certain mobs immune.   It's a major slap in the face to VI's midrange-level players to keep it as it stands.<br>

<br>
Who said anything about respect?<br>
<br>
I'm saying all you are doing is whining because someone more powerful than you is killing mobs that drop something you want. It has nothing to do with balance and everything to do with loot.<br>
<br>
Yeah it sucks if you are 'of appropriate' level and want to camp some mob for an item that one high level already has camped. You don't like it so you cobble together some rationalization why it's wrong.<br>
<br>
But the rule has always been first there has precedence. (within reason) No MB team is going to KS your dragon if you are there first. Not only that I have personally been on burn teams that was there first when some guild started showing up and we just bowed out. Generally in the time periods when guilds have a lot of ppl on.<br>
<br>
But if you think it takes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> skill</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to kill most of these mobs, by whatever means, you are deluded. All it takes now is enough people with enough power and knowing the all wonderful MT strategy. It may take 40 level 50's, 30 level 55's, 12 level 60's or 6 level 60's with 24+ AA, but it's all about numbers and nothing about skill. Grats to the ppl that figured out these things first, but it's been a long time since there was any twist on killing Kunark bosses (except the new VS).<br>
<br>
Gurunt has some points. But they are only valid if we accept that everyone <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> deserves</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to have their epic once they hit 50. I don't really buy into that. As an epicless Sorceror with 65AA I don't really buy into this theory. I'll probably have it someday, if that damned fish ever puts out. But I may not. I'm not losing sleep over it.<br>
<br>
Personally I don't think players should compete with other players for epics. But I did not make the rules. I think it should be a lot of legwork, then triggerred, very difficult fights that are limited to one group participation, so that strategy is actually necessary. So you do a lot of work then you spawn Gore, say. Your group and gore are in a 'cage match'. Lose and you have to do the work over. This way someone getting their epic at 50 say would actually mean something. Make it very hard, but take the player competition out of it.<br>
<br>
Also epics should probably not be MQ'able.<br>

<br>
guilds that would find kunark dragons a challenge are typically more casual players and general schedule their raids on a calendar or message board on the internet. If you plan your raids 2 weeks in advance in hopes of getting the kind of turnout you need to be successful I really don't like your chances spawn racing hardcore sorcerers...<br>
<br>
and there's plenty of strategy to gore if your not 30 level 60's slumming. you have to figure out the healing on the MT, how to deal with the ae, how to deal with the debuffing, how to deal with the fearing, what buffs to get, what spells will land, how to prevent the CH. just because you've known the strats inside and out for a long time doesn't mean there is no strat or that others must already know it too... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/upalaziousfrydaddy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palazious Frydaddy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/20/02 6:06:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=323.topic&index=214>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This may touch some nerves, but WTF lets see what happen</span><hr size=1> <br>
<br>
 One of the major progressions a guild has to learn is that some mobs will need to be checked on and if they're up then they need to have major strategies into mobilizing fast to kill them.<br>
<br>
This includes sending trackers out, keeping track of spawn times, everyone bound in the bazaar for fast mobilization, etc.<br>
<br>
This is the same now as it was before manaburn.<br>
<br>
You snooze, you lose.<br>
<br>
If your guild schedule's raids like this 2 weeks in advance, you will never see these mobs let alone mobilize first for it.<br>
<br>
Just like Sev yesterday.  We found out that he was up, started mobilizing.  EHL was faster, they got the kill. Grats EHL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Waiting around until primetime will never happen with these mobs.  It's part of the learning curve.<br>
<br>
People forget about the 144 minute refresh timer on MB.  Its not like a MB team will port to kunark and kill all the dragons within 20 minutes.  Thats almost 2 and a half hours between dragons, IF they are successful.<br>
<br>
Several of these mobs have been up for a few hours lately, if you would have tracked them you would have seen this.  Even Trak has been up for almost 48 hours the last two times he spawned.  The last VS spawn was up long enough to mobilized a guild last pop as well.<br>
<br>
Point is... Manaburn hasn't changed the fact that some of these mobs never make it to primetime.  They are heavily contested mobs and guilds like EHL seem to find them.  If they don't pop them our guild will.<br>
<br>
So your point is mute.  Manaburn hasn't made a difference at all on the fact that kunark dragons die when they spawn.<br>

There are more ignorant feckers around now than there ever was.<br>

There are also a lot of very nice people.  <br>

But as the rise of ignorant bastards increases, statistically speaking the rise of ignorant bastard wizards increases.  <br>

FK, it's not about every level 50 'deserving an epic'.... it's about mid-tier guilds having raid content.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's not about the MB-capable wizards being bad, it's about the ability to MB these dragons being bad, for game balance and progression.<br>
<br>
<br>
If Wraith decided to jump all over the kunark dragons and effectively shut out other folks, it would be bad....Wraith would be being pricks.  It's not gonna happen because as a team we won't put that effort in and would not agree to that.<br>
<br>
Now.... are we all in agreement that you cannot and will not be able to find 5 lvl 60 pricks among the mass of players on quellious?  I didn't think so.  If you check PA now you are likely to find a good chunk of a MB-dragon team up for sale.  Right now it's not too bad as the wizards are being cool about it with others... it only takes 5 people (make that accounts, you could line 5 systems infront of a single monkey and do this)... and you have a problem.<br>
<br>
Dragons are raid mobs..... raid forces tend to naturally progress.  <br>
<br>
Lower guk spawns (that ppl like to make an analogy with) are single-group spawns, always have... single groups/individuals farm and bottom feed indefinitely. <br>
<br>
This is the same issue that had happened with Naggy/Vox... they became TOO trivial at a certain level.  The difference this time is they became too trivial literally overnight yet only to a certain class.<br>
