I dont know the details where she called you a newb but you didn't come to us about it.. Next time do so.. I won't ignore you.  She explained that incident on halloween briefly someone else brought it up in guildchat. <br>
<br>
Calhar..<br>
<br>
I'd say she is different than mohogany.. Mohogany was a joker among other things.. Sirinab is all serious.. I don't know if Radjan is mad but i'd say if she was mad there would have to be something up..<br>
<br>
Radjan..<br>
<br>
Yep Legendary heroes.. Those were the good times.. and yes Sirinab was Sirina back then.<br>
<br>
Montty.<br>
<br>
First time I've heard of that incident in Sro.. Tell me about it.. and the fact they say she trained someone.. doesn't mean she actually did it.. or that it could have been exaggerated..<br>
<br>
Again come to the officers first when dealing with Sirinab.. She will ignore you.. The officers will not.. we can get the details we need and she won't call us Newbs... <p><a href="http://worldzone.net/technology/brian2554//signature.gif" target="_blank">

Last time I checked I was a few levels higher than her and I can actually find my way out of Thurg w/out a map and a guide.  I did take the other incident that caused that run in w/ Siri to a RIP member.... she called me a newb after we foiled her banker killing plot and she trained the rogue guild leader on my friend.  Running past my friend over and over again w/ aggro and then FDing near zone out is just making it a bit too obvious she was attempting to train him.  When I mentioned it to the RIP member there (might even have been you, name was Gaethan or something) the only response I got was &quot;she says she has her reasons&quot;.  /cheer justifcation.  Again I really dont care that I was called a newb.... the people who know me know my level of skill and I believe that Siri herself must have some respect for my ability to play my class since she constantly pulled 3-4 at a time in UD or even an extra one or two while we had mobs in camp.  <br>
<br>
Someone who trains to get back at people.... someone who destroys important npc's in GM events..... someone who throws a temper tantrum whenever someone in Velk's gets near one of her spiders... someone who kills the bankers to ruin the time of every other player in the zone.... someone who &quot;forgets where the zoneout to GD is&quot; aka &quot;fake accidental training&quot; ... someone who moans on the boards about some belt she felt she got screwed out of while constantly making comments to others like &quot;it's only a game, get over it, go cry elsewhere&quot;....  someone who laughs at another raid in PoA just because they took 4 DT's fighting a mob when her guild had just wiped out and had a huge cr... those are the kinds of actions that scream &quot;i'm a poor insecure newb who doesn't have the slightest clue&quot;.  But I will never ever be hurt by someone like that calling me a newb... someone who's not even the same level as me and won't ever fight half the mobs in the game I have doesn't qualify as a good judge of newbness imo.<br>

I didn't want to cause major ructions about the acts of someone this petty, to be honest. Not worth the waste of my (currently very limited due to work) playing time to sit and have /tell conversations with people who by all accounts will fob me off with &quot;she has her reasons&quot;. I knocked up the quick post as information to other people whom I respect and care for, who I know read this forum. The post took me all of three minutes to write while I was waiting for a web server to reboot. If it had impinged on my life any further, I probably wouldn't have bothered. <br>
<br>
Obviously she has her reasons. So do people who undertake me on motorways, or doormen who make me wait in the cold for an hour before letting me into a club (oh no, wait.. I WAS that doorman.. nm). Doesn't justify them, or make me any less pissed off about it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have to get on with my life now, I have a predictive dialler installation to project manage into the ground..<br>
<br>
ps - I'm not sure I'm too keen on the snide intonations in your posts pointing to me lying or exaggerating about the S Ro thing with Sirinoob(tm). I don't lie (except maybe to my soon-to-be-ex-wife). If I say she blatantly KSed the two of us, and boasted while doing it, as well as using the all-powerful and conquering cry of &quot;NOOB&quot; towards me (I hear the SAS have been running down dark alleys in Kandahar yelling &quot;NOOB&quot; at passing arabs in the latest MoD approved form of psychological warfare) then she did. No exaggeration, no lies. Want a character reference? Enough people who know me and my rep post and read here. I'm sure anyone with a reason to dispute my integrity (excluding my wife, should she somehow sneak onto this board) can follow this post.<br>
pps - look at the .sig. It says guild leader, I believe. Of a reasonable sized Euro hours guild. Yes, I know how frigging guilds run. I am in fact NOT a guild NOOB. I just wanted to clear that bit up. Thank you, and goodnight. <p><h8><font color=#0505ff> <center>Sarcastic? Me? Nah, you must have some <i>other</i> Shagbert in mind..</center></font> </h8>

Shagbert knows a wee bit about how guilds work and, as Montyy says, he's thoroughly trustworthy. I don't say that lightly, either. If Shags says Sirinab was KS'ing another DoSG member, I'm sure going to trust him. Hell, Siri hasn't even refuted it.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the whole &quot;Mohogany was a joker.. Sirinab is all serious&quot; line is a crock. She always uses the excuse that she did the Thurg thing because it was &quot;funny&quot; and that it was just a &quot;joke&quot;, and that is from her own post. Can't have it both ways.<br>

Yes salta that was me there.. I was there to investigate the situation and at that time I hadn't gathered all the facts... In fact I talked to her all night about it.. and she really hasnt done anything like that since.<br>
<br>
I told Sirinab to stop visiting these boards  and to let me handle it.. She isn't very good with criticism heh<br>
<br>
and I said i wasn't defending her actions.. Whenever she does something someone doesn't like and its a witnessed event.. I investigate fully and report to the leader (Sephrok) and this is for any member<br>

As for that Sro incident that is rather vague.. need more details.. <br>

Bah!  When LM/MC/DoSG did POA, I took 10+ DTs easily... and I wasnt even home that weekend.  Of course, Montyy really pissed off Kimja by logging me in to &quot;take one of many for the team&quot;.  It seems that he'd been wanting to dirtnap as well... but let's be reasonable... Chanters cant be wasting time on dirtnaps when there are needy crack patients out there.<br>
<br>
Gotta tell ya though... when I actually DID log on, it was friggin amusing as heck when every 30 seconds or so, everyone would try to guess who the next DT victim would be... and it got funnier with each beer I'd drink<br>
<br>
(Pssst... secret to a good wizzie DT is to slap a few stuns at 20 seconds, and then sit down at 29 seconds.  If yer lucky, you'll also get a summons). <p><center>
