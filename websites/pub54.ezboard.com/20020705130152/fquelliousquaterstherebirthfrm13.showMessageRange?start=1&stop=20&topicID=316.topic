Alot more detail went into the bizzare aliens from around the galaxy.  The plot was well set up, the story was good, the acting was good, and the jedi fight with Yoda will go down in history.  It did not feel rushed like the first one, and the story unfolded gradually.  I look forward to the next one.<br>

<br>
I'm about sick of the Episode 2 sucks threads. Its the easiest way to get attention right now. I've read people nitpicking the plot, the character development, the speed, the acting, ,the makeup, the audio....<br>
<br>
Thing is, when you start looking that hard for flaws that hard, you are going to find them, especially opinionated ones. <br>
<br>
Go back and watch your precious Episodes 4-6 with the zeal that you nitpick the current SW with. In direct comparison, we are seeing superior films. <br>
<br>
The only thing ruining the current SW films are the so called fans that have gotten so anal-retentive about the films that Lucas is having to be so careful about what is said and done.  These so called fans have ruined the essence of what SW is, and was, all about.  <br>
<br>
Before, it was almost sacred (Sad to say in some ways, but that is for another time). There were continuity issues, timeline issues, on screen errors, the list goes on. This new batch of so called fans is using that genius logic of the old ones are cool because they are old, and the new ones suck, because they are new. <br>
<br>
So when you leave the theater with your nitpicking issues about how the ship was 2 feet off the ground when you read on the Internet that they hover at 3.2 feet,  keep it to yourself.<br>
<br>
Watch the movies with your eyes, not a magnifying glass. Its a lot easier to see the movie that way.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uhavusin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Havusin</A> at: 5/16/02 3:07:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uacturian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Acturian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/16/02 3:07:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=316.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Episode 2 sucked</span><hr size=1> Sounds like Jay and silent bob strike back .. remember everyone was bitcvhing about bluntman and chronic? hahahahaha if george lucas came to your house and beat the absolute @#%$ out of you, that would be hillarious. =) (well not really since someone would get hurt, but imagine that old bearded bastard showing up and curbstomping someone .. heh.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ukarador.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karador</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/16/02 4:57:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=316.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Episode 2 sucked</span><hr size=1> Movie kicked ass.

Where to begin...<br>
<br>
I'll start with Havusin - this is a case of mistaken identity.  You seem to have me pegged as a fanboi, which isn't the case.  I don't have the interest or the time to read message boards all day (this is one of two or three that I even read), and I certainly don't have the patience for Star Wars geeks that defend the movies so blindly you would seriously think they get paid for it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Go back and watch your precious Episodes 4-6 with the zeal that you nitpick the current SW with. In direct comparison, we are seeing superior films.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually I do, but not about the &quot;world detail&quot; BS you cited at the end, about measurements or whatever.  I couldn't care less about that.  I look at elements common to any movie: plot, writing, acting, design, effects.  As an example, I don't say Return of the Jedi was the worst of the original three because of Ewoks or some continuity issue, but because the acting and directing wasn't what it was in Empire.  <br>
<br>
Whether or not these are &quot;superior films&quot; is more the subject of this discussion, and I simply don't think so.  The special effects are cooler, but great special effects do not a great movie make.  Lucas has gotten so caught up in playing with his new toys that he has forgotten how to simply make a good movie.  Special effects are a tool, but they don't make a story themselves.  Better movies have been made on virtually no money with no effects.<br>
<br>
The plot <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> set up well, the story <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> good, and he showed breathtaking landscapes on exotic new worlds with imaginative creatures.  The visuals were superb - that is his forte.  But when it came down to the body of the film - script and acting - it fell short.  The script was so full of trite, simplistic lines that got delivered like they were reading off a damn cue card, I cringed.  There were some bit characters that I thought came off very, very well: Anakin's mother Shmi (who held Ep.1 together along with Liam Neeson) and her husband, the elder Lars, are two that come to mind.  Another would be the new Panaka (the Queen's security officer).<br>
<br>
Now if you want to flame me for being an artsy film critic that you think ruins it for others because I can't just go enjoy a movie without overanalyzing it as 'film', go right ahead because you're probably right to a certain degree.  I enjoy good movies and I'm a very tough critic; I won't apologize for that.  But please, don't just say &quot;STFU this movie rocked and to say otherwise deserves an asskicking&quot; - all that does is reveal the amount of thought you've really put into the matter.<br>
<br>
One more thing, and once again this is my opinion: I thought Yoda's litesabre battle was pretty lame.  What was awesome was the way he opened his cloak, his litesabre floated to him, and he gave the Bruce Lee &quot;bring it&quot; signal.  But as for the fight itself, I'd rather watch the three-way battle at the end of Ep.1 (Duel of the Fates) any day of the week and twice on Sundays.<br>
<br>
Was it entertaining?  Hells yes.  I just didn't like it as much as I thought I would.<br>

<br>
Were there trite lines? Yes. But did they ever seem forced? Not really. I thought the worst acting in the movie was in the beginning, when Padame's security guard delivered the most flat line I've ever heard in any movie with a budget greater than $5. Happily, it only got better from there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Boy, it's pretty depressing to see that I'm the only one around here who apparently holds movies to a higher standard than that of The Mummy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I, too, hold movies to a much higher standard than that. The thing is, I didn't go to this one expecting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> American Beauty. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I expected a well-spun tale with some great effects, and I got more than I paid for. Palpatine's treachery and manipulation are amazing- there's no other word for it. If everyone else in the movie was terrible, if there were no flashy effects, even if the movie was an amateur flipbook with stupid looking stick figures, this would have been enough. You know walking in that Palpatine is evil... but for a moment, you can almost forget it. Brilliant acting and scriptwriting made him a dark and corrupt character who is so good at being evil that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> even the good guys are fooled. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> He tricks every Jedi on the counsil. That takes some doing.<br>
<br>
I think most of the critics who have knocked this movie have done so because they just don't understand the delicate machinations behind everything in it. It's brilliance in its simplest form.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Was it entertaining? Hells yes. I just didn't like it as much as I thought I would.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So what you're saying is, in effect, this movie didn't suck. You enjoyed it, but not as much as you'd imagined you would. Sorry. Next time you watch it, go in with zero expectations. You'll probably love it.<br>

And I'm forced to ask... if it was entertaining, than why did it suck? <p>Lauriston Pianoforte<br>That Guy<br>Bard of Quellious</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uzaphirien.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zaphirien</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Quiet One</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/16/02 7:25:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=316.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Episode 2 sucked</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And I'm forced to ask... if it was entertaining, than why did it suck?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Because sucky movies can still be entertaining - I draw a line between entertainment and art.  Examples: The Mummy (mildly entertaining), Wild Things (entertaining), or most sequels (sometimes entertaining but rarely live up to the original).<br>
<br>
I'll concede that I was possibly a bit harsh in saying it 'sucked' - I wrote the original post this morning and couldn't write more because I still had a term paper to finish up.  My thoughts developed throughout the day.<br>
<br>
No, I don't expect all movies to be 'art,' and I don't expect the same out of every movie I go to.  I didn't expect this to be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> American Beauty</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> either, though that was a good example of an excellent film.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Amelie</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would be an even better one.<br>
<br>
I went in with lower-than-normal expectations and I was still underwhelmed - that's the best way I can put it.  I know I'm going to get absolutely destroyed for this, but I liken it to The Matrix - very entertaining, great concept, story, plot, and effects.  The script was weak and the acting weaker.<br>
<br>
By the way, I agree completely about Palpatine - that guy is solid in every one he has been in.<br>

<br>
I can't prove you wrong. I can't make you like the movie. I can't even make you want to like it more than you already do. I can share my opinion, cite examples to support it, and debate issues that you do have,  all without the STFU tactics. I dont need them. In fact, people as long winded as myself avoid abbreviations like the plague.<br>
<br>
I said above, and I will say again. I am sick of the hate for this movie. People who dislike it are putting forth an extraordinary effort to tell the world that they dont like it. It is something that happens anytime something is as popular as this. I don't see hundreds of thousands of threads on the internet about the character development and plot of &quot;The New Guy&quot;, or some quip someone has with any 30 second portion of the film......I wonder why.<br>
<br>
Think about how difficult it must be to direct the middle episode, of the first trilogy,  of a 9 part series, in which the middle 3 are already completed (not to mention their popularity). You have to deal with backstory of a movie released a couple years ago, and with backstory of a movie released 25 years ago. Wow. I really dont think you realized how tied this cast and crews hands must have been in dealing with this....<br>
<br>
Not to mention that, while it may be hard for some to grasp, this may be the first Star Wars movie someone has ever seen. Think of it from their point of view. That is yet another challenge posed to the cast and crew that many people overlook. You have to maintain a balance between the first time viewers and those who have been fans for 20+ years. <br>
<br>
Taking all this into consideration, and what I said before..from this chair, Im still really pleased with the film. In fact, even more than I was before since I have thought about it more.<br>

While I didn't make that first post just to troll (otherwise why would I respond?), I made it partially because the distaste was still fresh in my head and partially just to start up a good thread on it. If I had entitled my thread &quot;Review of Ep.2&quot; and had been real level-headed about it, with the advantage of a second viewing and some perspective, it wouldn't get nearly the number of responses. Plus I just knew what sort of a response I would get out of this group.<br>
<br>
The second thing I want to point out to you in particular is, I wasn't addressing just you with the long post, and definitely not with the STFU part. That was pretty much just for Karador.<br>
<br>
About the challenge they had facing them within the context of a (possibly) 9-part series made out of order, and all that, you're right. That's where the storylines and plot do their job, and I've already said I thought they done well enough. It was the writing and the acting that made my Twizzlers taste a whole lot worse.<br>
<br>
To both you and Lauriston: I honestly haven't seen any vitriolic attacks of this movie anywhere by anyone, because I don't read alt.fan.star-wars anymore. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have read a decent number of reviews, though, and while I don't usually give them a whole lot of weight, when the vast majority agree on something there's usually a grain of truth to it. And as it turned out, I agreed with them too.<br>
<br>
That is all, and I agree to disagree as well.<br>
