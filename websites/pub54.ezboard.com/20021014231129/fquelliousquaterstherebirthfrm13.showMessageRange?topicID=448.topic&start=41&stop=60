Originally the SoF raid that I was on was going after as many epic mobs in the Hole as we could get in one day.  But since there were three raids all headed the same direction, we decided to only do Jaell (which can be done by multiple raids), Kindle (which can be done for multiple raids), and Kirn.  We talked to OE and CiA (great peeps) and they agreed to leave Kirn up for us while we stopped at Jaell for ONE ranger.  We responded to all camp checks in ooc and made our intentions quite clear.  Keeper was up but we chose to pass him by in order to focus on Kirn.<br>
<br>
It took a long time but you did drag two corpses for us.  We didn't insist.  You offered.  Raid leader accepted despite my advice to him to reject offer.  I thanked you as did rest of the raid.  I almost believed you truly wanted to help us until you offered Torpor in exchange to right to loot shaman epic piece.  <br>
<br>
I told you that we were going after Kirn for a friend and I was not willing to trade my assistance for spell.  (You may have actually had it.  I don't know.  I never asked to see it.  I wouldn't have trusted you to give it to us anyway if we had agreed to your deal.  Made me feel dirty just talking to you about it.)  I suggested you talk to the raid leader.  You asked me who he was but you weren't online when I replied.  <br>
<br>
We cleared way to the undead tower, ITU'd and went inside.  I was the first up the stairs.  Nobody else was there preparing to engage Kirn.  ITU dropped and rest of the raid was still coming up the stairs so I went into the room across from Kindle and died.  (Remember the polar bear corpse, Kuud.  That was my body you stepped over to get your epic.  Kind of hard to miss it, wasn't it.)  As more people started coming up top from our raid, they discovered that someone else had already done turn-in and was killing Kirn.  We were still having problems with chat channel and lag LDs and people had to go so we gathered up our dead, rezzed them, and left.  I figured it was Deluxe but wasn't sure until you said something.  You took advantage of us clearing way and me aggroing undead in tower and dragging them into corner away from Kirn to slip in behind us and engage mob.  Did you win race to Kirn?  Maybe... but you sure didn't do so fairly.<br>
<br>
Aye, it is a game but the way in which people play games says a lot about who they are in RL.  You must be a real jerk. <p><a href="http://216.118.107.63/SIGS/juror.jpg" target="_blank">

There were only a few SoF members on that raid, and the main objective was to help our FRIENDS with their epic pieces from the Hole.  I am sorry that you actually may have thought you fit in to that elite category as being our friend (you piece of shit pond scum).  However you lie.  If you did not see the OOC's and all that then you are blind.  We were headed to Kirn and you knew it.  I also saw you and your &quot;Deluxe&quot; buddies tailing us all the way down.  <br>
<br>
After speaking with some of the Deluxe Guild online, you are right where you belong Kuud.  It is quite unfortunate that a guild full of level 60 players could be so unscrupulous.  I cannot believe they actually stand up for you, which tells me that they all fit in the same comment I made of you above.  YOU and people like you are the reason that this server is going down hill.  You say &quot;it's only a game&quot;.  Yes you are right, but when people take time out of their &quot;game&quot; time to help people only to get screwed by the likes of you, it would piss anyone off.  I really like the way you try to play stupid and say &quot;I did not know you were going after Kirn&quot;... We are not as stupid as you are, and will not believe you anyways.  Someday you will need help, and I promise you, noone will be there to help you.<br>

<br>
You can all believe what I am about to say or not, makes no difference to me.<br>
<br>
I have known Kuud for awhile, although I can not say that we are friends. A friend does not offer something to you and then change the deal mid-stream.<br>
<br>
These are the facts from my dealings with Kuud.<br>
<br>
He has always been nice to me, when he thinks I can help him with something or can get him help with something.<br>
<br>
He did offer me a Heiro cloak for my monk while asking me to help him get his Tear. After he got the tear, he seemed to forget about the cloak. I said nothing to him about this, although i did let my guild know.<br>
<br>
I then attempted to help him do Kirn as long as he had some friends to help do this, as I was not going to ask my guild to take their time to do it, while I was supposed to receive a cloak, didnt seem fair to them.<br>
<br>
I showed up for Kirn and we made it to the city before we got wiped out. Most of the people that were there were either running off and getting killed causing us to have to go back for them, going LD or bitching that it was taking too long(yet they had never been on a Kirn run before) and trying to rush things and getting ahead of themselves. You do not rush through the City in The Hole with 2 groups of low 50's, you have to clear it properly or you will die, period.<br>
<br>
After we were wiped out, Kuud did log a mule and drag corpses to the ledge, then he logged, I ended up doing the rest of the CR for his raid while he logged to watch Barney and eat popcorn, I guess.<br>
<br>
I asked him about the Hiero cloak before the raid and he said he wanted to wait until we killed Kirn. I told him I would get the force needed, but would like the cloak and even offered to do Kirn right next time as well as 5K PP. Didn't get a response from him.<br>
<br>
I wrote it off as a scam and some time later I received a tell from Kuud that he had a Necklace of Superiority and was going to give it to me to help him with Kirn, not 5 minutes later i saw him auctioning it. Yet, I still did not say anything derogatory to him, guess that's just me.<br>
<br>
Some time passes and I receive a tell that he has Torpor and will give it to Gray Soldiers in return for help with his epic. I tell him we would help him with it and he says he will hold it for us, but during the same time he was offering it to others for help.<br>
<br>
Prior to all this happening Kuud and I were in SF duoing and I asked him if he had Greater Bear Form, he said no. I gave him the copy I had on me. A couple minutes later he said he had to go do something and would be right back, he never came back. Later that night I saw him auctioning the spell he said he did not have.<br>
<br>
Just not too long ago I saw him auctioning another copy of Greater Bear Form and I had a Shaman friend that needed it, I sent him a tell asking him if i could have it as I had a friend in need, I got no response. <br>
<br>
So the questions are:<br>
<br>
Has Kuud been scamming people? I believe so.<br>
<br>
Is Kuud a liar? most definitely.<br>
<br>
Is Kuud greedy? A resounding Yes.<br>
<br>
If Kuud considered me a friend, I dont think the above things would have taken place, but the whole time, I said nothing, guess thats just me not wanting to believe he would accept my offer to assist him when needed, give him something he said he did not have, yet, not trust me to honor my word to help him with his epic had he honored his original offer that he himself made me.<br>
<br>
You see Kuud, if you are truly friends with someone, you don't wave a carrot in front of their face and then jerk it away at the last moment and expect them to be your friend.<br>
<br>
Had you honored your agreement with the cloak, as I did with the Tear, not only would you have your epic still, but you would have had a whole guild of friends in Gray Soldiers which would have gladly welcomed you along on future raids and assistance should you ever needed it.<br>
<br>
I do not hate Kuud, as I hate noone, especially over a game, however, I do not trust him or his word anymore than I would trust a crack addict in a pharmacy.<br>
<br>
I personally hated to make this post, but I felt it needed to be addressed as I feel Kuud has insulted my intelligence on more than one occasion by refering to me as a friend, when his actions have proven otherwise.<br>

Why would I be jealous of a char that was ebayed out by one of the most retarded people ever to play this game?  I never said anything bad about the person playing the character now, I just pointed out that you are playing a char that went to SH and changed their name on returning to Quell.  Any offense you take to the statement is just you feeling bad about playing a char you didn't level and didn't work for the loot it now has.<br>
<br>
If you don't know that's how your name changed then I suggest you take a look into the history of the char before you start calling me ignorant and telling me to learn the facts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ueadrictheranger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eadric the Ranger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/10/02 3:04:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=448.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ?</span><hr size=1> while we're bashing Deluxe some more.. i was in chat today while Quellious was down (again), and Stylee was in there.

If anyone is willing to set-up a donation to move this prick off our server, I'll personally donate US$25.00 ( with confirmation from a GM that he moved ).<br>
<br>
If the person who is posting saying you’re Kuud's little brother really is his little brother, tell your parents I'll send US$100.00 to take computer privileges away from their son.<br>
<br>
I bought malo you jerk.<br>
I wouldn't have taken Torpor from you for any reason.<br>
<br>
I’m glad you got your epic. I’m not in the least bit happy for you though. I’m thrilled for the rest of the server because maybe now you’ll stop sending us tells!<br>
