You're right. It may not have happened if someone spoke up the day before.

Despite the apparent lack of communication, LC clearly had the larger engagement force there ready to take on Cursed cycle. Just by PnP alone we could have started the cycle. It was clearly evident that your guild attempted to hijack the spawn by holding a taskmaster &quot;hostage&quot; and not killing him, thus blowing the spawn for us, and buying you guys more time to get people there.<br>
<br>
You KNEW you didnt have enough people for cursed, and instead of give it up (as PnP states), you decided to be nasty about it and try and blow the spawn for us.<br>
<br>
Its the actions of your guild officers in instances like this that shape the server's opinion of you. Theres no wonder you are regarded so poorly by the server population, due to your childish acts like these. Apparently you guys were never taught to &quot;share&quot; or &quot;play nice&quot; when you went through kindergarden.<br>
<br>
LC and Vis have a working relationship on spawns just for this reason, so that we dont bump heads like this. Our officers are mature, and know its better time spent looking for other spawns than fighting, which is why we set up the system in the first place.<br>
<br>
So now a new kid enters the sandbox and needs to learn how to share. As your guild gets more efficient at taking down spawns, the one thing they havent done is to get more mature, particularly when relating to others. Maybe its time you guys got some new officers who are more mature and work well with other people, so that you can better interact with LC and vis, so that things like this dont happen again.<br>

<br>
&quot;90% of your posts on this message board are either to fuel a flame or to start one yourself&quot;<br>
<br>
Hi!  This is the part of the forum known as the &quot;flame boards&quot;.  Welcome to it!  Have a look around, you'll see that most other people around here are doing the same exact thing.  Funny that they would choose to do such a thing on the &quot;flame boards&quot;.  Maybe we can gather them all online at the same time so you may lecture us on what the proper thing to do on a &quot;flame board&quot; is.<br>
<br>
Another quote from Denia:<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway, i await your next post, where you try to make yourself seem better than me. Fun fun fun!!&quot;<br>
<br>
I posted about an issue raised in another thread.  My original intent wasn't to make myself out to be any better than you.  You were the one who made personal attacks with the oh so witty comments about recess, my maturity, and getting boners from posting on message boards.  I never made any derogatory comments about you or Gurunt, I merely asked you to get your stories straight.  From your first response where you deemed my writings &quot;not worthy of a response&quot; you have been out to make yourself seem better than me.  Go go irony!  Now you're claiming my posts are only out to make me look better than you when the only person that has done anything of the sort is you.  It's funny that you've tried to take the high road and say &quot;I won't flame anymore because I'd rather not feed people like you&quot; yet you've thrown out more personal insults than anyone else in this thread.<br>
<br>
I raised the Vis issues you had last night mostly because it amused me and I felt vindicated for sitting there 2 hours on Monday night.  I won't even go in to how ironic it is to hear from a few people that Vis cleared the way and were followed up.<br>
<br>
Hopefully communication will get better, both between guilds and in them as wasted time for everyone isn't beneficial at all. <p>Salta

Esmalyn, you did not get what I wrote.  It's ok. Lemme explain.<br>
<br>
I never said &quot;the man is trying to keep us down&quot;, I said we need to be in on the early communication or we will inevitably run into each other.  It isn't about other guys out to get us, it's about other guys not considering or talking with us when they make their plans, and all 3 of us looking at the same mobs. They're not trying to deny us anything, they just aren't taking us into consideration until they find us at the mob they had planned on the day or week before.<br>
<br>
We don't need to ask their permission to do these mobs either, Esmalyn, if that's what you are implying.   When we feel we are ready for a mob, and that mob is up, and nobody is on him.. we just do it.   We're not doing it to screw anybody over, we don't do it because we want to disrupt vis and lotus's sharing.  <br>
<br>
So, we just want to communicate more now, so that we can keep the peace with the top-end game on this server being a three way now.   I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;initiative&quot; if it's not us asking for better lines of communication.   <br>

I don't know what tattle knew, but Binedina knew we in tended glyphed cycle before you were in zone.  I know this from Binedina herself.<br>
<br>
When I logged in, taskmasters were being killed, we both had 50+ folks.  That's all I know firsthand about that.  I know we had about 30 folks before LC started arriving.   Enough for glyphed at least.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure a number of people on both sides have less than the full story.   <br>
<br>
We both did things that would piss us off if done to us.  WE (my side) do not have fun with that kind of play, we do not want that to be the norm.  <br>

<br>
And I never said you said it. It's my impression based on other comments you've made.<br>
<br>
&quot;I said we need to be in on the early communication or we will inevitably run into each other.&quot;<br>
<br>
We're in agreement here.<br>
<br>
&quot;It isn't about other guys out to get us, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>it's about other guys not considering or talking with us when they make their plans,</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> and all 3 of us looking at the same mobs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Right-o! Who are you to expect LM, or Vis, or &quot;insert guild du jour&quot; to had better think about Wraith when they're making plans, 'cause gosh darn it, we're that good! <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> there's already been a rapport established between Wraith and other guilds on spawn cycles then I'm off, but going by the enmity displayed and your demand that others make room for Wraith, I'm probably not. The burden to open communication is on Wraith, no one else. Say hell froze over and my guild of two years was ready to take a shot at these mobs. I don't expect anyone to take notice of what we've accomplished 'cause it would lead to other expectations from the server, like immediately taking me into the fold without so much as a little smooching. (Note for those with fragile egos: smooching, you know? Like making an attempt to get along RL, bowing out when necessary--NOT kissing ass.)<br>
<br>
&quot;We don't need to ask their permission to do these mobs either, Esmalyn, if that's what you are implying.&quot;<br>
<br>
Technically no, you don't need anyone's permission.<br>
<br>
&quot;When we feel we are ready for a mob, and that mob is up, and nobody is on him...we just do it.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is part of the problem. You want to be in on the schedule but are ready to use it to your advantage if the opportunity presents itself. By this statement, LC was just as right to start the spawn because you hadn't. You say you don't want to screw anybody's schedule, but that's what you're doing, then complain that no one takes Wraith seriously. If Wraith makes an honest attempt smooth things over, other guilds make space for them in the schedule <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> within a reasonable amount of time,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and Wraith gets shafted? Well you have every right to bitch/complain/kick for being treated like a two-dollar whore. But until then Wraith is acting like, and being treated like, a red-headed stepchild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugemlin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gemlin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/10/02 2:32:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get your stories straight~</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Then the next fight you send in eye which open doors sendiung line of sight agro on the people sitting in the tunnel between the two doors.

Thats really funny how the mobs in the &quot;Buff room&quot; NEVER MOVED. The Golem in the Creator Room aggroed on you.<br>

As far as Mugen goes. He never casted a spell on your mobs. Ask a GM to check the logs.<br>

Gemlin make sure you get the truth from your guildmembers before you make yourslef look like an ass sticking up for that idiot.<br>
<br>
its also funny how you dont deny sending eyes to @#%$ with the fight.<br>
<br>
Its funny how you guys think that just becasue you were the firt to kill a mob you now OWN it and can control who else can kill or even attempt it.<br>
<br>
And, you wonder why you lost a good percentage of your talented players to a new guild. <p><center><a href="http://www.ketelkaotic.com"><img src="http://www.ketelkaotic.com/newsig6.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://www.wraithguild.com">Wraith Guild</a><br>

Esmalyn,  you still don't get it.<br>
<br>
I don't know how to explain it more simply.<br>
<br>
LC decides to do a mob, talks to Vis, it's all set.<br>
<br>
LC show up for mob and wraith is there.  We fight.<br>
<br>
Part of the issue is 2 weeks ago we were not doing the ssra mobs, so LC and Vis didn't have particular reason to expect us there regularly.<br>
<br>
You still think all of this has to do with one side wanting to hurt the other from the outset, or show up the other.   It's not.   <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

Christ!<br>
<br>
<br>
The GM told Wraith one thing.  He told Vis another.  When he changed his decsion, he told one side why, not the other.  <br>
<br>
The GM SUCKED.<br>
<br>
The GM *told us* first that it was Vis that caused the adds.  So we got mad at Vis.  Then he determined that eyes cannot aggro.  So we asked him to explain what he saw. Then he told us that the eye itself didn't aggro but the eye opened the door and that *he saw* that that aggrod the mobs behind the door. So it was still 'vis intereference', tho unintentional,  that caused the wipe and we'd get another shot.  THEN Ellise talked with him more and he changed the story completely when pressed and said the mobs that were the only ones that could have been affected by the eye/door didn't move.   The best part ---- he NEVER told wraith about that last part. He just told us it was Vis's turn again, and wouldn't explain at all.   Ellise told me about his change in story.<br>
<br>
I don't believe the eyes caused anything.  The mobs that hit us were snakes, and one golem, the one golem was a side golem, got aggrod when the snakes ran by.  I saw that golem aggro myself.  The mobs that the GM told us he saw aggro from behind the door are all golems.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guys... eveyone stop fanning this crap.  We all got memebers that feel justified in being pissed off, fine.  Lets all run each other down in /gu if you gotta, but let the officers work things out so we stop this from being the norm.<br>

I think the problem is a little more complicated than guilds holding grudges for one another. I've tried to avoid the details of this latest Wraith tiff because until the officers that were involved from the getgo make a statement, it's going to remain a &quot;this is my side of the story,&quot; and won't encompass everything that went on.<br>
<br>
Gurunt, you've said that Wraith isn't taken into consideration for these spawns. When I read those statements my mind tells me that you want to be included in the schedule. That involves sharing spawns and giving other guilds consideration from Wraith's part as well. I'm not sure if phrasing this question another way would do better (or sounds less cheesy for that matter), but here goes: Do you want to play with the big boys? If yes, take whatever measures are necessary within your power to ensure you get a piece of the pie instead of scrapping at the dinner table, and everyone will be happier. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uzupe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zupe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Port Bitch Extraordinaire</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/10/02 3:16:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=44>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://keele.wwm.net/images/coolfrog.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get your stories straight~</span><hr size=1> About the eyes that you supposedly caught getting argo.

That's exactly what we want to do.  We want to be included.  2 months ago we were good, but LC/VIs were still a full tier ahead of us in mobs, now we're all targeting the exact same stuff.  I don't say that to brag, it's what's happening.  The only mob they are on we are not yet is Emperor, and we're keying up for that.  <br>
<br>
It's obvious that none of us are good at dealing politely and giving ground when we all have a crew on-site ready to kill.  Ellise and Binedina talk beforehand so they avoid the 2 crews from butting heads at all.  <br>
<br>
Oviously with 3 its' gonna be a bit more complicated to divvy up but we aren't looking to tell them what we want and them to get out of the way.  We want to just get everyone thier share without this large-scale conflict.  We expect to give as much ground as we get.  Heck, since it's a 3 way split we'll end up giving 2/3 of the time.<br>
<br>
It's a lot easier to tell 50 people we're not doing so-and-so today, we'll do this-or-that instead;  than it is to tell 50 ppl to leave a zone they all just rushed to, or been hanging out in for hours waiting for some folks to log in on.  <br>
<br>
As this thread also illustrates, all sides have their share of folks who apparently dig this sort of strife to no end and go out of their way to fan it.  They do it here, and they do it in game.  If an officer or two from the guilds work things out beforehand, those ppl don't get the chance to cross paths and make matters worse.<br>
