I think it was obvious to most the Paladin class had taken the place in EQ of what the cleirc is in most other D&amp;D based games. All you had to do was play a cleirc for about 10 lvls to know you wont be in the thick of the fight.<br>

Thats exactly why I played a cleric when EQ came out.  I thought I was getting D&amp;D online.  My two favorite classes in D&amp;D were clerics and rogues (rogues because it was fun to cower and be pathetic and lie and backstab people, or kill people in my party and blame it on a troll =P).<br>
  An EQ Cleric has very little to do with a D&amp;D Cleric at all.  I remember in my lower levels getting the DoA spam invites every day, and I would stoutly deny them all the time.. well for 2 reasons.  Most of them were tards, and I always saw Apotheke doing her &quot;cleric&quot; job, which was sitting there just healing her DoA group as they tore though mob after mob gettign exp.  It didnt look like any fun to me, well i later adapted that playstyle and learned to have fun in it as well.  But at the time that sort of thing just looked ridiculous to me, and being that the cleric class was not set in stone, as it is now, I was determined to make my cleric my own way.  This meant using my ITU running into the house in unrest, finding a ghoul or soemthing and yaulping and nuking it while i beat on it with my hammer of wrath!!..  ok so it took me a couple weeks to get from 15-20 this way, and I died multiple times a day =)... but I had fun!<br>
<br>
I later learned what it was like to really be a cleric in EQ and how to perform my set role efficiently, and that this game was not to be a roleplaying game, that it was in fact quite hard to roleplay.  I still have had the most excellent time being a cleric in just a healing role, but I have never ceased to maximize my melee ability any way i could through weapons and gear and spell line up whilst soloing.  <br>
<br>
Whats this &quot;only need one warrior on a raid&quot; mentality =P?  What did you guys raid?  I think its best to have 4 or 5 warriors on any raid.  Even in the most beautiful flawless fight the MT can always drop to enrage if the healers and him are not on thier toes... then who is gonna tank the mob?<br>
<br>
Or how about doing those ridiculous flurry drakes in tov using one warrior.  You can either wait ages for defensive to recycle on your &quot;one and only needed warrior&quot;, or you can send him in undefensive, either way if he dies you have a lot of problems to fix the situation before slow hits those things.  Anyways I always thought it was nice to have at least a bare minimum of 3 warriors on any raid..... we certainly always used all the warriors we had availiable.<br>
<br>
Dont even list that lull line as a useful spell either.  You may wanna try to log that cleric in and try to go Lull something =P.  At least he can rez himself after he trys, or you can always ask Salta how uber &quot;Wake of Tranquility&quot; is =P.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well I guess a lot of classes are still lacking balance and no one seems to be happy with whatever proposed balance because of class envy.  I am sorry that I was allowed to have fun for a day.  The hammer in its original form now appears to be a drop in ssra from an ubermob instead, meaning I will never get it again, and only with a lot of money (which I do not have, which most clerics do not have).  So now top tier guilds will have clerics who are balanced.. like yay.<br>
<br>
<br>
Im with Answer on this.  Clerics are not this easy class who get this oh so special treatment.  It is true that uberguilds have special invite policys jsut for clerics because of the way the game mechanics work agaisnt ubermobs.  I don't think clerics are to blame for this, not do i think many clerics started a cleric jsut so they could get  into one of these guilds.  Nor do all clerics want to get into one of these guilds.  Bottom line is, it is a hard job, it is rewarding and fun dropping a mob for the first or second time, it is however tedious and boring to do it again and again, as well as requiring a cleric to be there from start to finish of the raid.  Clerics leaving disband raids, and you do not want to spoil the fun of 40-50 people for your own self interest when you can avoid it.  You want those people to have fun to.  Many clerics are not happy with such an obligation or such an important role in the post velious raiding environment of EQ.  I wish they would jsut give shamans and druids full CH and be done with it.  Give me the hammer or some other fun alternatives, and they can have the damn CH spell for all I care =P.  It is about fun, and a lot of EQ is not fun unfortunately.  THis was fun and I want it back!<br>

bah....i soloed my first 15-18 lvls  and this was three years ago.  but its at that point where we do not get the same melee abilities as regular melees.<br>
<br>
You know, it would be nice to be able to log on for only an hour or so and to solo instead of spending that time trying to find a group or having your friends move to where you are. <br>
<br>
With the stuff VI put in, we are not even close to the best melee'ers in the game.  It was just giving us the option to be able to melee.  Our non-undead dd's suck, i think someone said we had some good spells (mipp i think) like blind an lull.  Give me a fucking break.  Everyone and their brother knows that the lull line maybe works 40% of the time and when it doesnt, you get all the mobs on you...making this spell worthless.  That blind spell is worthless as well.  Our stun line is very good though. <p><strong><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=158388">Feadorn Lifegiver</a></strong><br>

Now this was well before every fucking twink was weilding lammy's...this was when an uber warrior had a couple of Langseaxe's...you remember those?  When the MOST UBER WEAPON a tank would ever MAYBE see was a couple of Yaks.  Hell a Mithril 2h Sword was around 10k then which is probably equivelant to well over 100k by todays standards.<br>
<br>
I soloed my way to around 20 also...Meleeing, tanking,  and nuking my way through orcs, dervs, and gators in oasis.  At that time as a previous poster stated, the cleric class was not set in stone as it is now. It was not obvious that a clerics role was going to be that of a heal/rez bitch.  Back then there were not really any large raids like we have now...a raid then was like MM castle or L Guk.  CH Rotation?  what's that? Now..Just heal and stfu...that's the life of a cleric.  <br>
<br>
If things had progressed on the same level from then to now as far as the Melee ability of a cleric compared to that of a Warrior/Paladin, Clerics would always have been a viable solo class, but that's not what happened.  Other classes got better and better Melee gear where clerics put shit like a paw of opalla into their main hand just for the wisdom.  Why have a weapon?  Of course back then Rangers were tanks and Druids were gods....now look at those classes. /snicker<br>
<br>
Now I made an art of finding something else to do besides heal.  I was often known to run out and nuke shit while on the CH team.  Did it in NTOV...did it on THO...did it on just about every mob to include AoW..Tunare (Even though the slut resisted every one)...you name it.  So what I'm saying here...shit i forgot what my point was...anyways...who in the blue hell are you?  oh yah that was my point. <p>Gimily Smashfist 60th Cleric (retired)<BR>Gimilly Smashfist 59th Warrior</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwooweewoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wooweewoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/6/02 1:32:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=499.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IMO...</span><hr size=1> don't know what clerics are thinking....you should have expected the nerf on the proc.  if you know what you are doing, you would know how overpower it is in solo and group (when you see pal rather heal and cleric just melee in raid, you know there's something wrong).  If you want to blame anyone, blame VI for not testing fully before put them to live.  Btw, 2 clerics in same group can do a lot of diff things, unlike wars in raid--either be MT, or hit attack and go afk =P. You probably just havnt figure out what 2 clerics in same group can do.  <br>
<br>
and druids...if nothing changes for druid soon, good luck finding any druid online (o well..there are always port-bot and those in raid guild~).  Druid won't get group for sure as of today, thx xp nerf and cleric buffed up--now no one would want to hunt in easy place and those are the only places where druid can be an ok healer.  You won't see many druids solo either, i can get more xp in a raid trying to KS from overnuking wiz than quad kiting whole day.  (Sad to see my best option for xp is from a raid.)  <br>
<br>
anyway...it's all stupid VI's fault.  don't think any company can be so dumb.  basically, they killed 14 classes in 1 patch while make clerics solo better and be even more wanted in group. no wonder ppl get so mad...and if you are a cleric and can't see what's wrong..open your eyes please!  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwooweewoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wooweewoo</A> at: 9/6/02 1:35:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufanainy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fanainy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/6/02 1:44:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=499.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IMO...</span><hr size=1> PSST,  they fixed the exp penalty.

rofl I had that same thought when someone mentioned lull.  Upper Dogs in velks requires a 59/60 puller to get most single.  We had a 57 war or something and he had never pulled before and I had gotten all the way to level 60 before even trying out the uber spell &quot;wake of tranquility&quot;.  I had always heard it sucked but needed to experience it first hand.  It went something like this....<br>
<br>
You tell the group &quot;okay i'll try this ae lull, you go in and pull once I'm done casting&quot;<br>
Random pickup group warrior &quot;okay&quot;<br>
You begin to cast wake of tranquility.<br>
Your target resisted the wake of tranquility spell.<br>
Your target resisted the wake of tranquility spell.<br>
Your target resisted the wake of tranquility spell.<br>
an icepaw warrior looks less agressive.<br>
Your target resisted the wake of tranquility spell.<br>
Salta tells the group &quot;omg 4/5 resisted let me die&quot;<br>
You have been slain by an icepaw champion<br>
Salta tells Elsatia &quot;ready for rez please!&quot;<br>
<br>
Not only is the resist rate extremely high (even against level 10 mobs) a resist causes aggro.<br>
<br>
As far as my comments go you don't need to be in an uber guild to solo in FG.  I didn't say everyone had primal and a fun tunare snare item.  However, items with slowing, rooting, regeneration are effects that dont require an uber guild to attain.  My point was that you claimed the only shot you had as a warrior was hoping you can make the mob run out of hp before you.  As a counter to that point I listed options that are available to melees that makes it more than just killing the mob before it kills you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucenainnknightofpurity.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CenainnKnightofPurity</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Kill Gnomes</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/6/02 4:58:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=499.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IMO...</span><hr size=1> Clerics = Pallywannabe's now with this patch =p Muhahah <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The people who play clerics tend to LIKE playing clerics. What they don't like is everyone leaving them all alone after raiding is done because they might slow down that all important XP/second. <br>

that's just wrong...why should we treat someone differently just because they happened to be a cleric? get off your high horse. We pay the same money, we play the same game, we should be treated equially.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Agreed! So these soloists should allow clerics to join them, since nobody should discriminate based on the actual utility of a character! Ah, but people DO discriminate based on utility, don't they? When a group wants a damage dealer, they don't go get a bard. When they want a healer for raids, they don't get a druid. And when they want healing for XP grinds against low blues, they don't get a cleric.<br>

Take that away and you'll see all clerics disappear, because there'd be no fucking reason to play one.<br>

It's brilliant!&quot;<br>
<br>
of coz it is.  you dont think the problem with clerics is that they are too important?  if guild raid only need 4 or 5 clerics, you think clerics will still have a hard time finding a group in guild?  i dont mind clerics getting solo power, not that they can't solo already. but you have to open your eyes, if cleric becomes very good at solo and still the only good healer in raid, you will start seeing 20, 30 clerics in a guild..you think that will help clerics finding group?  EDIT: I think clerics usually have no problem finding pick up group, but i would think clerics would love to hunt with their guildmates more most of the time.<br>
<br>
&quot;The people who play clerics tend to LIKE playing clerics. What they don't like is everyone leaving them all alone after raiding is done because they might slow down that all important XP/second.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talk to those ppl who have to play another person's clerics for raid just becoz they HAVE to inorder for raid to continue (eg. me!).  I would think ppl like to play their own charactor more than another person's.  I never like playing cleric, but because i have access to one, i was asked to play cleric a lot of time.  See anything wrong there?  How many ppl you know started a cleric twink not because they like it, but just because they are more needed?  I know quite a few of them.  How many clerics you know switched to another class because they are burn out?  If a class is buring out ppl, there's something wrong. I don't see a lot of other classes burning out ppl like clerics.  So...ppl who don't want to play clerics are forced to play clerics, ppl who love to play clerics are burn out from it.  And you are saying that's ok?<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd say you obviously didn't try hard, but I don't know you well enough to know if that's true or not.&quot;<br>
<br>
yeah..i didn't really try very hard.  but there's no point of trying if ppl don't want to accept the real problem with clerics--they are too important. Spread the healing out and VI can give more fun/useful spells or some other fun role for clerics. Until then, if you just keep giving clerics more and more, it will just become an endless cycle--more ppl play clerics, clerics having harder time to find group, more clerics quit,VI give clerics more, repeat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Agreed! So these soloists should allow clerics to join them, since nobody should discriminate based on the actual utility of a character!

And when they want healing for XP grinds against low blues, they don't get a cleric.&quot;<br>
<br>
so..you basically just avoid my whole point and put up and counter example that has nothing to do with my point.  My point is clerics shouldn't be treated like god just because they are clerics--any arguement for that?<br>
<br>
&quot;Take that away and you'll see all clerics disappear, because there'd be no fucking reason to play one&quot;<br>
<br>
then you probably don't love your class as much as you think. or your main reason for playing clerics is just to feel important.  either way, same conclusion. those who love their class will stick with it no matter what.<br>
