I have my eyes set on a faithstone.  If, for some oddball reason, I find myself lucky enough to beat the druids to the iron oxide in Steamfont, I am gonna need the services of a 250 potter.<br>
<br>
So, being new to the whole tradeskill game, could someone give me a rundown on what I need to do?  Here are my questions:<br>
<br>
First, how do I find a 250 potter?<br>
<br>
Second, how do I avoid being scammed?  Some components of a faithstone are very expensive (upwards of 300pp per attempt) and the iron oxide is very rare.  Plat is easy to replace, but losing an iron oxide is going to be mind numbingly annoying given their rarity.  If the potter reports that the attempt failed, how can I verify the failure?  Is it possible for the potter to pocket the iron oxide and /tell me a failure happened?  If I do get scammed, what should I do?<br>
<br>
Third, I have a specific question regarding creation of the faithstone, since I don't know how pottery works.  From directions given on allakhazam, it appears I put together a bunch of stuff to create an idol, which can fail.  Then I am to create a specific glaze using the iron oxide, which it appears never fails (good news!).  The confusing part to me is where you &quot;fire&quot; the idol with the glaze.  Can this part fail?  I am really concerned with losing the iron oxide.  Losing plat on the idol attempts I can handle.<br>

<br>
or you could look for Bostica in game. I heard someone say she has the highest pottery skill on the servers. She has sold a number of people I know (including me) faithstones.  Her price, unless its gone up recently is 4500pp. And she's a sweetheart.<br>
<br>
Voter was also advertising he was a GM potter on auction last night.  Don't know much more than that about him, tho...<br>
<br>
As to failing on firing..  yes, rare since the firing trivializes so much lower than the actual pottery combine, but I've had it happen to me on something that trivial to me by 50-60 skill points.  <br>
<br>
If you have the 4500, I'd just buy one, honestly.  Tunare apparently requires a vow of poverty from her clerics (oh how I wish the Wench would have mentioned that in advance /sigh) so the 4500 was a huge chunk of change, but it was easily the best investment I've made.<br>

As for 250 skill potters, both Skrabbit and Bostica are at that level. Skrabbit was reporting good success on Faithstones before 250, but confirm that with EQTraders before wasting your money on someone with lesser skills. I have 214 in Pottery (plus 5% Geerlock) and could also help you if you wish.<br>

I know Bostica was tickled pink when I showed up with Everfrost essence, divine Crystalline Glaze, imbued ivory, mana ('chanter stuff, know it was expensive, though!) enchanted clay, and imbued ivory when I asked for my Everfrost Spirit Stone.  All she had to do was hit combine, and not waste any significant amounts of time on me.<br>
<br>
Expect to pay a small to moderate fee for the GrandMaster to hit combine, even if you bring all the ingredients with you.  Those that belly-ache about payin' a price for a &quot;simple&quot; combine obviously have little experience with tradeskills.  After 20+ studded and re-inforced Acrylia combines, I still haven't skilled up from 158  (averagin' around 65-75 percent success on studded with geerlock, and about 30 percent on re-inforced... but I've got some nice gear on my baby monkey now!)<br>
<br>
Those that haven't played with tradeskills have no clue how much time and money it takes to become a grandmaster.  Tailoring is especially hard, since none of the components are easily obtainable (you can't just walk up to a vendor, and buy 2 stacks of Acrylia pieces, and a stack of superb hopper pelts).  Smithin' is gettin' there fast, especially with the re-vamp of the trivials recently.  (Shadowscream will become the new cuss words of smiths everywhere)<br>

Either can fail but firing requires less skill. Geerlock (+5% made by tinker... I love mine.) and WIS buff improve chance of success but you can lose supplies even on trivial combines.<br>
<br>
To create a faithstone, you combine items from vendor (idol sketch, flask of water, sculpting tools); items from chanter (large block of enchanted clay, vial of distilled mana - requires 2 sapphires); celestial essence (no fail combine of celestial solvent and Scent of Marr in mortar and pestle); and essence for zone related to deity you worship made by master brewer from something foraged or collected near that zone (list on eqtraders.com) on wheel.<br>
<br>
If the gods are kind and you succeed, take unfired stone and combine it in kiln with HQ firing sheet and divine crystalline glaze (no fail combine of white lead, permafrost crystals, iron oxide in glaze mortar.)   Iron oxide used to be easy to acquire when its main use was for dyes.  Now ground spawns are camped and you have to hunt in the Hole or kill elementals in low level zones for hours to get it.<br>
<br>
Any reputable tradeskiller will usually group with customer if doing a combine for money.  Customer can see success or fail message as long as he or she is in the same zone.  I am never offended if someone asks me to do this, especially if it's for something like golden idol.  Some tradeskillers (like myself when I am not busy) will do combines for free if you provide most of the materials (clay, distilled mana, essences, permafrost crystal, and iron oxide in this case) because raising skill means a ton of combines and supplies are expensive/time-consuming to obtain in mass quantities.<br>
<br>
I would recommend buying one from Bostica or Skrabbit.  Failure rate on star ruby steins and faithstones/spiritstones is depressingly high.  Other GM potters can do it but if they have unlucky streak, you might end up paying almost as much as they sell them for.<br>

That is a matter of personal preference. <br>
 Actually my faithstone price is down to 4000 now, the failures are rarer and  the Quelious potter are having constant price wars.  I rarely do idols and steins any more as there is to much haggling involved. <br>
 If you decide to get the combine done you want to find someone who has the advertised skill and is not going to steal the items being combined.  If you are looking for someone close to 250 you can check there range slot to see if they made their &quot;trade epic&quot; which all trades have.  As for the other risk I would avoid dealing with mules or characters that no one knows. <br>
  If you buy you can sometimes get a good discount for making some of the payment in supplies which include iron oxide, permafrost crystals, distilled mana, perhaps even a some cinnamon sticks.  <br>
  If you are looking for a stein (hard item but attempts are only 70pp each) your best bet might be someone in the 220s because these are excellent work for skill increases.  For Idols it is exactly the opposite, the glaze is a chore to get and the item is trivial (the Tunare one is some are not) so for that one I would look for someone near 250.  For faithstone the purchased parts only run 225 but they are hard (a 200 can easily fail 20 in a row) and the non-purchased parts include some that are annoying to get in quantity and require a brewer and an enchanter. <br>
  If you get a combine done and you bring the supplies you do not need to bring the sculptors tools, they are returned after use so every potter has them.  <br>
  Najena is also an option for getting oxide and they layout might be better suited for a cleric than running around the Steamfont Mountains.<br>
  Skrabbit is also a halfling and you you find him he would be an excellent choice.<br>
  Nothing is more frustrating than failing on the firing (you lose more too). <br>
  If anyone knows a cleric form Paniel looking for a Faithstone I have one made they could get real cheap....(don't even ask why) <br>

One thing if you want to get a potter (or any other tradeskiller) to do combine for you just pay them 3x what they ask for <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Some actually may ask for nothing but that you bring the items to them.

Since I am a high elf cleric, I can only use the Faithstone of Nature.  I click on it, and 30 seconds later, I am zoned to Felwithe.  The portal is called &quot;Prayer to Tunare&quot;.<br>
<br>
As the cleric of a group, I feel the need to bind close to wherever we are fighting.  This stone will be invaluable to me for dealing with that.<br>

Kill mob, Faithstone back to your old-world home city, Manastone back to full (and you know how fast a cleric can do that), Gate back to your soloing grounds. If I wasn't so poor I'd buy a manastone and start doing this. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

My wares or on a friend's vendor Mercuria but the only clue to that is the guild tags and most of the mules there do not have tags. <br>
 A while ago I made a Faithstone for Paniel Erudite Clerics of Cazic, which to the best of my knowlege there are no clerics on Quelious that can use it.  I gave this to Mercuria to display and within two days two others had them up for sale too. Maybe it is time to start a dialy special 1000 off on one perticular diety depending on the day of the week and watch them all follow.<br>

I've made a bunch of stuff for the guild and sold a few other items to strangers, but generally I'm not out to edge anyone out of their market or what-have-you. With the bazaar I sold some oddball portstones that I had lying around from early experiments and so just for kicks and out of curiousity I made just about every one that I had an essence for and popped them on the mule. I don't have any illusions about them actually selling, but I'm easily amused I guess. <br>
