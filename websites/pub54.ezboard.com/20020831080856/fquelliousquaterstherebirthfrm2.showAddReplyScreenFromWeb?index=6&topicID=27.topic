<br>
Shiobahn Fyrestrike (formerly Goldbrooke) sat quietly upon a small blanket by the lakeside in her home town.  Above her loomed the guilds of the magical arts, her own designation included amongst them, and every so often she could hear the workings of different defensive spells coming from above.  Her momentary solitude was dedicated to toying with a pouch of runes, identifying each of the marks upon them to further her research for greater spells.  Quasqueton had promised her even greater runes when he returned back from his quest, but the days seemed to grow longer and longer in his absence.  It was in this moment of study and reflection that she distinctly heard the soft footfalls of the sure-footed ranger approaching her.<br>
<br>
A smile crept across the delicately defined high Elven face as she let the initial shock of the visit wear away, and Shio rose to her feet.  She stood taller than the ranger, though her frame more willowy, and her hair was quite obviously flame kissed by her deity of the arts, Solusek Ro, whom she called upon for the power of her spells.  She reached out her hands to the ranger as she spoke softly in the language of the elves "Creoso eska, tinu en'Tunare.  It is good to see you home cousin."  Millikin gripped her hands in return though her present mood was unreadable, as often it was, by her kin.  "Diol'lle, Shiobahn.  It is good to return once again."<br>
<br>
Shiobahn studied her a moment, certain there was a tale to be told, but not knowing when the ranger would tell it, if she decided to speak of it at all.  "We shall catch up over a glass of Elven wine.  The day is still early and the tavern is open across town.  Just allow me to pack my things."  Shio did not offer much room for argument, though then she rarely did.  She quickly bent down to retrieve her runes, pouring them back into a small pouch that hung from her belt.  She carried a small myriad of trinkets this way, including a finely crafted golden bowl bearing a few small dings in the bottom which hinted at the fact she was not afraid to swing it at something if one of her spells was going awry, no matter how futile the attempt was.  Tucking her blanket into a backpack she then set off on foot along side her cousin to the tavern.<br>
<br>

Felwith - Northern District<br>
<br>
A glass of Elven wine and a treat of a small fruit tart later the two sat together in an out of the way corner of the bar.  It was an enjoyable time filled with tales of adventure, many of Millikin's taking place in the frozen lands of Velious which intrigued Shio and much of Shio's having taken place another great distance away, in the newly explored moon of Luclin.  It was Millikin's comments of the wastelands in the far west reaches of the frozen continent that perked Shio's attention.  "Cousin, why have you come home from such great adventures?  And have you heard word of a Quasqueton?  He has been in those far reaching lands for some time up to now under quest of the Coldain.  I know he is allied to the dragon beasts that survive out there, but he has not sent word recently and I worry.  The last I knew he had enlisted the aid of the Troubadour Autumnwyld, but it is still a harsh land for wizard and bard alone."<br>
<br>
She quickly saw the look of recognition in Millikin's eyes as she uttered the names, and a look of hope appeared upon her face.  She felt the matter bore further explanation and she quickly added in "Quas and I were bound together just this spring in a quiet ceremony under Ro's watchful eye.  It is a difficult balance some days, love and magic.  We did not make a spectacle of our union, I am sorry to have not informed you but it is nearly impossible to track the tracker." <br>

Had she heard of Quasqueton? Of course she had. Her thoughts momentarily turned to her initial meeting with him. Autumn had invited her to venture into Charasis, the Howling Stones with some of her recent adventuring companions. The purpose of the foray into the tomb of the late Drusilla Sathir was for archaeological reasons: Quasqueton wished to complete a set of Kylong armor and had spent considerable time gathering up the different pieces of armor once worn by the Iksar tribe.<br>
<br>
He had seemed a bit unconventional, to say the least. Instead of wielding magic with the calculating efficiency of Valdayana D`Varr or passionate devotion of Saldaria Snowspirit, Quasqueton blithely hurled lightning or fire at the walking dead or golem sentries that protected the place as if he were playing a game of catch. Eventually they obtained the final piece of armor for his collection, a chainmail tunic. Millikin had been surprised that the enchantment placed on by its iksar creators granting the wearer enhanced strength had remained in tact despite the onslaught of magic and melee required to destroy the iksar skeletal remains that had been wearing it.<br>
<br>
She had met him subsequently a few more times, once in the Umbral Plains, but more commonly in Velious. During a Coldain assault on the Ry`Gorr fort, a gem mining expedition in the Siren's Grotto, and once while exploring the Dragon Necropolis. Millikin snapped out of her mental reverie as Shiobahn explained that they had been married recently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I do know him. I've met him and adventured with him, the last time was while in Velious.&quot; Millikin rubbed the back of her neck, idly wondering how such a detail could have been forgotten to have been mentioned by her parents or her sister in their correspondence. Then it occurred to her that even they may not know. Acting on spontaneous impulse was a common trait, particularly in the Goldbrooke family and Millikin could not honestly say she always acted only after careful deliberation.<br>
<br>
Nor could she exactly sum up her feelings on hearing the news except that she somehow expected it to come back and haunt her. Somehow. Millikin reached for the black medicine pouch she was wearing around her neck to make sure it was still there as she downed the last of her wine then took a deep breath, hoping her offer wouldn't turn out to be more than she bargained for.<br>
<br>
&quot;It appears my list of errands for arcanists is expanding. Did you have a message you wanted me to deliver to him?&quot; <br>
