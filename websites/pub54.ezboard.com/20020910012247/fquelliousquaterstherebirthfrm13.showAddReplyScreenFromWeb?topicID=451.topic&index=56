<br>
I talked with Jama awhile, he died 6 times pulling Sev.  He felt like crap about the whole incident.  He tried talking to pala awhile afterward.<br>
<br>
Where was the DB camp when they got trainined?  FoB zone?  Staircase?  Sev has a huge aggro range.. who was in camp when the dragon hit, and where was camp?  That honestly makes a huge diff if you want to think it was or was not intentional.   <br>
<br>
<br>
Pala said in the first post manteca sent him a tell saying if he got 20ppl he'd back off, and pala replied saying ok, and they'll back off if he gets 20.  So Jama tells the MB team he has a deal worked out with DB.  Pala supports this, his only defense was he didn't take it seriously, didn't realize manteca was a scout for a MB team.  So saying Jama lied to or misled the MB team is directly contradicted by Pala.  <br>
<br>
<br>
How is this a wraith flame?  Are the other MB wizards saying they had no idea DB was there?  That the 6 times manteca died pulling that caused the 2 trains they were ignorant of what was going on in zone?  <br>
<br>
<br>
Wraith tried to &quot;take over&quot; the manaburn channel when we now (as of today)  have a total of 3 MB wizards?  That doesn't make sense.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jama doesn't read many boards at all, he's among the most selfless people I know in game.  The running joke with Jama is his insane store of points in game becasue the guy never bids on anything (he finally spent points on a burrower robe)...<br>
Vent against him if you will, tho it would be more productive to contact him in game.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Trying to make this a wraith bash is silly... in order to do so you contradict the initial post by pala, and a post saying wraith was also helping DB, claim no more than 3 MB wizzies could run the MB channel, and that 4 or 5 other wizards sat in zone while all this happened with no idea what was going on.  <br>
<br>
I don't like manaburn vs kunark dragons, I think it's retarded in terms of game balance.  I don't hold it against the wizards who use it tho.  From accounts by lalian and jama in game and what's posted here, it looks like bad communication mostly.... If I knew where the DB camp was that was trained, would make a stronger case one way or the other.  <br>
<br>
  The MB *team* there pulled and burned with around 18 DB in zone.   I don't like that in itself.   I personally would have much preffered if the DB's got trained unintentionally the MB crew would just give them a clean shot in reparation, or teamed up.  I don't run the MB team, despite Wraith's 3 (2 if it was more than a few weeks ago) MB wizards attempting  to take it over.<br>
<br>
I've talked with Jama about this in game, please bring it up with him if you need to continue this further. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

-- Gurunt quotes<br>
<br>
That's 5 more chances than Gray Soldiers had to pull CT. =P I would assume that, if DB wasn't in the zone in full force when Jama started, they would definitely have enough people for the kill by the last try. During those six tries and alleged trains, Jama didn't hear anything about DB's intentions?<br>
<br>
&quot;Pala said in the first post Manteca sent him a tell saying if he got 20ppl he'd back off, and Pala replied saying ok, and they'll back off if he gets 20. So Jama tells the MB team he has a deal worked out with DB.&quot;<br>
<br>
Let's say that Palaz' guild made a mistake by jokingly saying they would back off if Manteca (or is it Mantica?) and crew got 20 people in. There are 2 discrepancies. Palaz said it occurred in OOC, Mantica said he sent Palaz a /tell. (As an aside, Mantica must've never intended to keep this promise. I may not know what all entails burning a Kunark dragon, but any player can guess it doesn't take more than 6 burners to bring the dragon down as MB teams gain widespread notoriety, or infamy in this case.) Which leads me to my next question: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> there 20 people on the burner side when the pulls began? So far, no one has eluded to there being more than 6 on the burn team. That means if this &quot;deal&quot; could be defended as a done deal between DB and the burners, the burners (and puller) did NOT hold up to their side of the agreement. <br>
<br>
&quot;How is this a Wraith flame?&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, how is this a Wraith flame? I replied first not knowing or caring what guild the puller(s) was/were in.<br>
<br>
&quot;Are the other MB wizards saying they had no idea DB was there? That the 6 times Manteca died pulling that caused the 2 trains they were ignorant of what was going on in zone?&quot;<br>
<br>
The other burners aren't saying much, just like your guildmate. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugurunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurunt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Krup Knight</span><br>  Posts: 233<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/5/02 6:00:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=451.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: trend</span><hr size=1> <br>
Point being if both sides agreed (joking or not) that they would back off if the other side got 20... neither side got 20, so neither side lied or did wrong on that count.   Neither side said they would not engage untill they had 20 ppl.  Either side could have engaged at any time...<br>
<br>
<br>
Pala says he responded to and acknowledged Manteca's offer, and in the same post says it never happened.  That is the biggest discrepancy.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's back to the &quot;is it fair that 5 wizzies can do what it takes 20 non-porters to do&quot; argument.  Whether or not the MB team should have taken Sev at all.   I do think the incident is fishy, but I don't buy that it's somehow all jama's fault.   It would require a lot of effort for mediocre loot from a guy that has next to 0 loot aspirations, and an incredibly stupid and deaf/blind MB team to pull off the way some ppl are making this out.  <br>

-- Gurunt<br>
<br>
In Palaz' first post he says after the second train they had over 18 people in the zone and more coming. If you want to quibble with numbers Gurunt, go ahead and call Palaz an exaggerator or hallucinating pothead at the time this was going on. Deal or not, jokingly or not, you can't escape the fact any MBer or MB puller is lying through their teeth when they say they will back off if they are not capable of bringing 20 wizards in. Lying or stalling, take your pick.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's back to the 'is it fair that 5 wizzies can do what it takes 20 non-porters to do' argument.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not making that argument. I don't want to get distracted from one question in my mind: Why did someone feel the need to bullshit? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font> <br> <br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
