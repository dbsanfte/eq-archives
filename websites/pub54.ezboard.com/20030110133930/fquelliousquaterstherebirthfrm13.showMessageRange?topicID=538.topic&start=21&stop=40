<br>
I grouped with her a couple times in HK waaaaaaaay back when...she was the frickin' main tank, but she'd go afk for like 25-30 minutes at a stretch and just sit there and suck up exp. Well, after a coupla times of that happening, we all just booted her. <br>
<br>
She comes back after like an hour, is still standing in the warrior room with us....she's like &quot;What happened? Guys?&quot;<br>
<br>
lol<br>
<br>
If you're a big enough doorknob that you go AFK for that long, and you're the friggin' tank, EXPECT to get booted.<br>
<br>
Also Sirinab, though I never actually grouped with her but I was around for her antics in Thurgadin with the banker. Nice. Can anyone say &quot;Wheel of Karma&quot;? Smacked her in the arse, that one did. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I was having very VERY bad connection problems back then. I had gotten DSL then moved to a different location (apparently out of range, but the company never told me). My isp would go down for seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, even a month once.<br>
<br>
EQ was not an enjoyable experience very much back then at all, going LD at random times. Especially in the middle of fights or soloing.<br>
<br>
I remember that fight very well. We pulled the Ry`Gorr Chief and 2 elite guards came tagging along. The enchanter mezzed away and we started to pound away at the chief. We all agreed to run to CC when the chief died because we were getting beaten so badly.<br>
<br>
Once the chief died I waited a second and ran and checked the corpse, told the group a Spine Chill Spear dropped. I looted it, invised, and ran like mad to CC zone (which is what we had planned). As soon as I zone in, boom, LD.<br>
<br>
In this situation does it look bad? Yes. Did I know I was screwed because it looked like this? Yes. I came back when my ISP came back up (a few days later) and petitioned stating what had happened. I spoke with a GM and he said I had no warnings, petitions, or reports on me at all. <br>
<br>
I was soon hit by many tells saying what a Ninja Looter I was and such, I recognized one name from the group. I said I would be willing to get the group back together and roll on the spine chill spear, his response was &quot;I don't even want to see you again&quot;.<br>
<br>
What was I to do? I had an item that looked ninja looted in the eyes of many when few people knew I was innocent. I gave it away to some random person in gfay. I didn't want to deal with it anymore.<br>
<br>
Talasar, what I just told you is not a lie. I would never intentionally steal anything from anyone. I go out of my way to help people and always lend a hand when I can. You can ask a few of my friends from way back when if I really did go LD so much from my ISP. I have never been denied a rez, group, or anything else because of what you seem to be telling and no one responding.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe in karma, once again, I would NEVER ever steal from anyone. I offered you the money it goes for now but you refused, see me trying to make amends for a misfortune back then? <p><CENTER>

I grouped with him before he later joined Wraith. <br>
<br>
Was before I joined Vis also, so I think it was Jan/Feb of 2001.. <br>
<br>
anyway, i grouped with him when he was playing his dwarf cleric saying over and over how he hated all uber guilds. <br>
<br>
then like he quit the cleric, and later on it was Wilkon &lt;Wraith&gt; .. <br>
<br>
so i donno which Wilkion (god cant remember his cleric's name) that I was grouped with. <br>

And don't think about grouping with her.  You might as well have a warrior as the cleric, actually the warrior would do a better job.<br>

Froteo - Very obvious as to why. However being an ass in Ssra Temple pingponging mobs and single handedly derailing a Chardok raid stand out in my mind<br>

Zakneffan - Ninja Looted my group, (I'm sure Nazzy remembers this SAD action on his part) Was over some stupid ice claok or something off some stupid bear in GD. A stupid thing to kill your rep over.<br>
<br>
Those are my top 2 really. There have beenothers in various pick up groups but lately I have been lucky not to group with total nippleheads such as these. There was one level 60 Ranger recently in Velks who would go OOM from PULLING in UD. I mentioned that arrows don't take mana, gave him some, and he STILL went oom after 4 pulls! We went from having a totally broken UD with Broken gargs to full pop againwith that twit, wish I could remember his name.......<br>
<br>
Edit - Oh yeah I forgot to add, Megonna/Slasra. Great player, nice guy too. But he has this tail obsession thing with himself and claims humans stink and such. Fact is a lizard that was born in a rancid sewer like cabalis has no room to talk :P<br>

Meaning if I wasn't sitting in the same place as them, I was talking to them on the phone.  The point of this thread is the worst people we've ever grouped with, anyone who ninja's and then lies about it is always going to be in my list of worst people to group with.  I don't care if you are denied anything.  You will always be up there with people I will avoid grouping with just because I would hate to think your DSL might go out again after you looted something and then you might be forced to lie to me and my friends about it.<br>
<br>
Yes, I did and do refuse to let you pay me now for the Spinechill because of the simple fact, the money didn't matter to me then nor does it now.  What you did matters alot more to me.  Which is why I won't ever forget nor will you ever receive aid from me.  That being said, your story is a pack of lies and half truths.  But I really don't care if anyone believes my side or your side of the story.  Karma is good thing and I hope it comes around. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>
