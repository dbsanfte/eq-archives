I felt it needed to be said. <br>
<br>
<br>
Well, the server just came down for 2 hours, after like we havent had enough patches and emergency patches as it is....so I'm a bit bored.<br>
<br>
<br>
That being said...<br>
<br>
Its funny as a bard growing up, you hear so many stories about guilds. When I was in a small guild for a year, and even when I recently was in a power guild, I must say, that I heard so many horror stories about certain guilds. I'd just like to take the time to clear up the air about some guilds, for anybody out there who judges without first finding out for themselves, or just basically doesnt know. <br>
<br>
All I ever heard was &quot;Wraith is so greedy, You shoulda seen them when they camped ALL of lower guk&quot; &quot;They try to control everything, they think they're so powerful&quot;..I really heard this stuff. Well let me tell you what, other then Havusin, They really got some nice people over in that camp. I chat with a few of them here and there. And I even had the pleasure to do Trak with them once or twice. They are by no means ks'ers, or greedy people. In fact, I've never had a bad experience with a member of Wraith, and thats 100 people in that guild. Says something about the guild doesnt it?...<br>
<br>
I heard something simliar about Descent eating up all the small guilds, trying to be &quot;like Wraith, but worse&quot; but obviously I found a different point of view on Descent, as I was happily guilded with them for a few months. Some of my best friends on the server, have made their home in Descent. I was quite proud to let people know I was in such a great guild, with great people, I wore my tag with pride. <br>
<br>
About the same time that Lotus was growing quickly, and I realized they were a major player (while in a small guild, some friends of my from Silent Shadow mentioned 1 or 2 of their members went to Lotus) they started catching crap here on QQ. I read those 100something posts from LC members, Small guild members, and other strong guilds. Turned into this huge rant with Lotus defending themselves. I didnt know a single Lotus cept Nileya. But after the server slowly adjusted to whats kinda come natural (ffa/fcfs) I noticed how Lotus didnt bother anybody, they kinda just did their own thing, nobody was mad at Lotus anymore. And even more recently I met a bunch of them in Teemple of Veeshan, And kinda like Havusin with Wraith, Other than Alyssandra and Ledrone, Lotus has some really nice people. I cant believe they were ever given such a hard time, If only people would find out for themselves before generalizing...<br>
<br>
And Last, but not least in this Novel/Essay on Quellious powerguilds....<br>
<br>
If anybody gets judged by Tag first, and by true personality and character second, its a member of Vis Maior. This is gonna sound rehashed, after what I said about my friends in the other 3 guilds, but...I recently took the time to meet them. I didnt know what to expect, honestly (and I hate to say it) after everything that I heard, I was real weary and cautious. Afterall..this is &quot;Vis Maior&quot; .. Let me tell you. I am glad I have taken the time to meet most of the Vis family, and befriend quite a few of them. A good number of you have never been or seen Vis in action. Let me tell you, you're missing out. They have got to be the best at what they do on the server, but they should be -- they work hard. VERY hard. They deserve everything they own and get.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm sure my nose is brown now, since I just praised all 4 powerguilds on the server. But the point here is...<br>
<br>
If you dont take the time to find out for yourself before you judge someone, and you only base your opinions of others on hearsay or what your friend told you, or what your guildleader told you. Then that is definitely your loss, and you are really missing out. <br>
<br>
If you ever catch yourself thinking or saying Oohh..he's &quot;a Wraith&quot; or &quot;a Vis&quot;, stop yourself, whack yourself upside the head, and then stop generalizing and stereotyping. A tag makes nobody, only their actions, personality, and character do. <br>

What do you mean &quot;Other than Alyssandra and Ledrone, Lotus has nice people&quot;....<br>
<br>
You dork! Think i dont read these flame boards? Thought you could slip one past Aly did ya?<br>
<br>
boooooo bard! I cant believe i was just cut down by someone named &quot;Chikkin&quot;! Ohhh! the humanity!<br>
<br>
Admittedly, I can be grumpy sometimes. Like the other day in Sebilis when some dingdong named Doomrider started spamming the zone saying &quot;Lotus people are stoopit&quot;. So I bring the battle to tells and he starts flaming me in tells with your typical pre-adolescent &quot;i screwed your mother last night&quot;, &quot;you have no life&quot; and &quot;I cant believe you leveled a bard all the way to 57&quot; (this coming from an SK) cutdown attempts. People like that who dont even know me yet flame me directly based on my guild tag give me great amusement.<br>
<br>
Then there are the people who think I'm ignoring them when they send me tells and i dont respond. Well, quick rant on being a bard, especially when you're doing crowd control in sebilis, twisting 4 songs, mezzing 3 mobs and still leaving a second to hack and slash doesnt leave much time to chat. Actually it drives me bonkers. Alyss being my first character i ever created, had i known i would have developed chronic tendonitis and carpal tunnel due to all the repetetive clicking i do I would have chosen a monk over a bard. Not to mention i have a really bad short term memory. If you send me a tell, then i zone, i will forget the tell by the time i'm done loading (ok, ok, slow-ass computer to boot). Its not that i'm ignoring you (unless your name is Ledrone)<br>
<br>
So yeh, kentucky fried chikkin boy here has a point. At least get to know someone before you flame them.<br>

Just a suggestion for the bards that have trouble getting a bunch of tells during twisting:  Turn on AFK with a message that simply says 'I'm busy in combat twisting songs, try later' or something to that effect.  I got the idea from one of the cooler clerics around, Yaya, while asking her to rez me in LGuk.  I send her a tell letting her know I had dragged my body to the zone and got a reply back saying &quot;Busy rezzing, I'll get back to you later&quot; or something like that.  She still answered me right away, but it sure hit me as a good idea for my bard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Samedi Empyreal
