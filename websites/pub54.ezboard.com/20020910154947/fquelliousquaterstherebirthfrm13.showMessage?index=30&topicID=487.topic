<br>
1)  Druids are a grouping class.  I don't know many soloing druids, cause I spend all my time grouping, but the druids I do know are groupers, not soloers.  Soloing is incredibly boring.  Why play an online game to solo?  I never could figure that one out.<br>
<br>
2).  I use DA all the time.  Duoing with a monk?  Monk getting beat on, cast that CH, boom, mega aggro, DA, its all good.  I remember the first time we killed one of the Brothers, Quinn I think, (all because Xabatar is too lazy to camp Raster), Quinn was beating the crap out of the warrior, I started casting DA about a second after the warrior started to fight, I think he was at 4 bubbles, by the time the CH landed, he was around 1 bubble.  Needless to say, I smacked down my DA hotkey and Quinn went back to beating on the warrior.  If druids don't get DA, and Verant doesn't cheapen heal aggro, there is going to be a huge increase in the number of dead druids.  If your druid is your evaccer, and you don't have a resser, this may pose problems.<br>
<br>
For those that like to fight totally safe fights with low blues for fastest exp gain, then yeah, druids can easily replace clerics (but in that situation, they can now anyways).  I don't really see druids soloing for 54 levels suddenly being welcomed into groups at 54 to try out their hot new CH.  I know several druids in my guild who I am confident can handle CH duty, particularly for an offtank group.  But there is goign to be a learning curve, just like for anything else.  <br>

If you are doing anything remotely challenging, you are going to want a cleric or pally to be there to res.<br>

Why fight something you know your going to win, without a doubt. I play this game for the challenges it provides. So while giving dru's and shaman's better heals, i may still have a dru in my group for snare/evac/buffs, but i'm still going to want that cleric for his actual CH and res. even if dru/shm had their new heals and the clerics had their new damage and pet's n` stuff i would still take a cleric over them any day of the week. so while giving dru's and shaman's better heals to help out, each class is still going to be wanted as they have been. but saying that, clerics have and will always be first or second priority in my group, due to the fact of res. I may not be the most expert exp'er, but i know when i want exp and there is a chance of dying, i could care less a druid could heal good and port around, or a shaman can slow and heal a bit better. because the fact holds a complete heal is a complete heal, and a 56 res is a 56 res. so i don't see how making clerics do more damage with a pet/weapon would make them any more valuable, they are already the most valued class in the game by far IMO. Maybe War's are the best tanks, but they die alot, probably just under the ranger in total deaths. /poke rangers. So why would a warrior or even a ranger for that matter want a dru/shaman over a cleric. even how they stand now. am i right or am i wrong? besides if you can't find a cleric for the life of you, but if thats how it is, i would much rather just not exp myself. due to the fact i don't exp alot, i just can't spare the exp loss when it take so long for avid players to lvl. I'm not talking bout crazy people who get power lvled, or just exp grind till they can't think. i'm talking about the people who exp when they want, and raid/quest when they can. this is EverQuest not EverExp.<br>
<br>
I just don't see why SoE/VI or what ever they call them selves now, think a cleric is less wanted then shaman or druid even with a better heal. I'm not saying it would off set the game to give the clerics a better chance of hitting a mob, or what ever. but Why would you put your cleric in danger of dying? DA's are nice, clerics get 2 of them. but when those are used up and your done hitting the mob go to sit down, i think not. Either they have some crazy idea of tweeking with the game, or i just don't see the game how they or other may see it.<br>
<br>
I really like what people have been saying on this topic, because even though i've been away for 2 1/2 months i still remember how to play, and what it means to be on the hate list. Maybe someone else could actually give a good reason besides, oh dru's get this and shaman's get that, so cleric's should get this as an answer to the preist class. because logiclly it doesn't make sense. What do others think, i want to hear more. i'm sure others have similar idea's or completly different ones. speak up i would like to hear, because i feel to one sided on this topic.<br>
<br>
Again, i don't think it would mess up EQ as a game, but as a roleplayer it may seem a bit odd, and in bad judgement. but thats me, and your you, so lets hear it. VI/SOE if you troll these boards maybe you have a better explaination. mabe not who knows. i just think this should be looked at a bit closer then how it is shown. maybe it has, but i'm not a tester, so i don't know what PoP is going to be like, or how it will make the cleric class still the best healer, but more wanted in groups. <br>
<br>
Thanks for reading this, i know its kind of long, but if you know me i can just go on and on, all in one run-on sentence if i'd like. =) but not tonight.<br>

its late here, so some of this may sound like jibberish, so sorry if it does. but i feel strongly about what i say, until i hear good hard evidence, to why it makes them more wanted. maybe more wanted to be played? doubt it but maybe. I know every class can get burned out, i've had it myself. but every class has their advantages and disadvantages for a reason.<br>

You guys say wizards are balanced at 60, and I will have to take your word for it, and it's the younger wizards who need it. A few weeks ago, on a HoT raid I was so impressed with Jinnikinics mighty nukes that I finally started a wizard on my own. He's level 29 night, so not uber, but not really a noob anymore - and I have been pretty happy with him. I know he can't melee to literally save his life, but is that really so bad? I think all the classes need defining features, or we have 13 different models of battlemages. My little wizard doesn't melee, but that's below him, anyways, that's for the more savage melee classes... let them get all dirty and sweaty <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I can't comment on getting groups to much though, cause I don't do pickup groups anymore. Long ago I realized that most zones are populated with far more idiots then sarnaks and frogloks, and I pretty group exclusively with my guildmates.  <p><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22703"

Almost Complete Heal? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) is to get more high level groups out of Velks, Seb, and so forth and into the upcoming PoP, I like this a lot.<br>
<br>
As a druid myself, this is great. I've been kicking my experience meter since Chloroblast because I soooooo need a better heal for raids, and just grouping in general. I don't get a better heal until 60 though, and even that isn't too great. You clerics probably don't know (maybe you have an alt though), but its really freakin' frustrating to keep jumping up and healing regularly in case adds show up.<br>
<br>
I group in Velks quite a bit with my guild, and yeah...I can manage it, but I'd like a little more security. It sucks also in times when you have a bunch of melee on, a named somewhere pops, and the guild gives a big sigh because...there's not enough clerics on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Clerics definitely still have the upper hand on healing though, no doubt that cleric heals are more <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> efficient</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> than anything I can pull. I'd sell my epic if I could, to have that kind of healing power. <br>
<br>
Want to make clerics better soloers? Give them a SoW equivalent at higher levels. That way if Verant's new additives don't work too well, they can at least run their asses off to escape (if you're out of mana or something), or be able to quickly get back to rez themselves. <br>
<br>
One thing I definitely would like druids to get that I should request...more stun spells. There's a couple lightning spells that have a weak stun effect, but they also cause damage. Hook us up with a no damage stun! Would definitely help grouping more if you can stun gate/CH mobs more effectively.<br>
<br>
Shamans need a better heal too! Although I feel sorry for them when it happens...more cannibalizing than before. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
As for wizards in groups...I don't know too much about what they get, but I'll leave suggestions and you wizards out there let me know what you think, and feel free to give examples of what you already have <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Wizards = better snares, dots, damage shields? <br>
<br>
I can't list much other than damage type stuff...but you know what would get wizards more groups? Familiars without the fucking flapping sounds.<br>

This wouldn't make us better soloers.  Giving us mana efficient nukes/dots or even a snare...that would make us better soloers.  Even when it comes to undead, our nukes/dots aren't too efficient.  I can solo 1 regular mob or 2 undead mobs before I'm oom.  Still doesn't compare to a quad kite.<br>

That is true.<br>
<br>
The lure and draught line of nukes are getting a bit out of date..  Making lures unresistable is a nice step but upping draught damage would be the way to make wizards more group friendly..<br>
<br>
Snare? gah i hate to snare.. I always forget.  I don't think snare would make wizards more group friendly.  Wizards have a bad image in groups cause all they do is sit there... most people who pickup group aren't always the highest quality players.. They never check class websites just log in every day get some exp with a slow group and hope when they reach 60 months from now they will join a fabled uber guild they have always read stories about.  They view classes by what they do in the group not what people say about them..  Warrior rogue monks? they hit things they good.  Cleric? they heal me need dat. Enchanters? they haste me need dem. Shamans? they slow and buff me gotta have dat. Are there any other classes in their mind? no.  This is why all the other classes have trouble finding groups cause people want the fastest exp available and don't want a wizard who sits all the time slowing them down.<br>
<br>
Though it would be controversial.. Make it so all classes can med standing up after 55..  I think that will fix all the classes right there. up their melee skills a bit to give them about a 10 DPS..<br>

SOLO... That is the reason i don't see how this melee damage/bash would do anything for making clerics WANT to group, if they can solo now, why would they want to group, besides if they are lonely. Thats why giving them those new heals is a good start, but VI/SoE should think of a different answer to letting clerics have the choice of soloing. This is a game of grouping unless your one of those druids and wizards who get to quad kite. who get that because they get to port us around out of their way period. I really think any class shouldn't be able to solo a blue post 46, and be able to do it efficently. thats why they made this game with the group box. don't you think us warrior's who should be able to cut through any mob with 17 others waiting to die. no this isn't Diablo. this isn't a solo game. this is everquest, and to quest more times then not you must have help with it to be completed. <br>
<br>
I also don't think giving clerics an innate SoW effect, would work either, yes they die alot running around. but thats because they messed up. learn new tactics of running around. I have several for running without sow/jboots. this is a game of strategy. I don't want to keep flaming without giving an idea to improve or change this. so i myself think their pet should be even cheaper in mana sence it disappers. and yes it is a pet, so it half retarded. aswell as it will hit harder, with a nasty proc. but it can't be healed by the cleric. it would have to be healed by say a DRUID or SHAMAN sence they'll be getting a new ACH spell. the clerics pet would have about that many HP so it could get a CH but it would be from someone else. this may seem strange, but it might get more dru/shaman/cleric's in groups together one way or another. but these classes really can't tank, so they would a tank or 2 and a caster or 2. say necro for manafeed, or wizard for /evac/snare if shaman in group instead of druid. etc so on and so forth. would that make a bit more sence then letting clerics do more damage themselves, due to we don't want them aggroed, so they wouldn't be healing their pet to get aggro, or be hitting the mob often to increase hate. <br>
<br>
this is coming along, i also like the idea of standing/medding. maybe start at 46, but each lvl they increase the amount of mana they get is more then they normally would standing, but sitting would still produce the most mana efficently, but while they are casting, or standing to just look around, they would be gaining mana. so just as an example.<br>

<br>
i know this isn't exactly how mana regenerates, but this is more of just a system, of how it may improve through your higher lvls.  I'm sure 30 mana per tick may seem like alot, but i'm not a caster and i was just rounding to a number without a decimal so maybe in actuallity it would be like a 46 would be getting 5.259 mana per tick standing up or something like 14.958 as an example.<br>
<br>
but what do i know, im just a warrior.<br>
<br>
I just didn't want to say oh no that shouldn't be, and then not give a probable solution, without making a class do something they normally wouldn't like for an example a wizard meleeing with his new 25/20 staff he found in luclin.<br>
<br>
I really like how this game works, and knowing more about how each class works. but thats improbable to understand it all. I just like to voice my opinion, and think maybe EQ might go dude, your a badass come work for us, =P hehe JK. <br>
<br>
just some thoughts, i'm sure they aren't prefect, but we are working in the right direction i believe. i know we've also got off to who to help other classes, but if you tweek one you've got to tweek the others. one way or another, until a caster is a caster and hybrid is a hybrid, and a tank is tank we'll be having discussions on similar topics. <br>

Plate or not, their defense cap is still below a melee's. Some players are more interested in resists or hp's or AC than others, and that crosses class lines, but my desire to have a high hp/resist rogue with moderate AC and decent stats is not a guarantee that Es will turn out that way. If they *really* want to give clerics the option to solo the class needs mana effective nukes. Clerics may be the only casting class able to wear plate armor, but EQ is too far along its shelf life to revamp the critical cleric role (although from a roleplaying perspective warrior clerics is nothing new). EQ clerics are effectively casters in heavy armor. Improve what they're already good at--spells--unless Verant raises their defense/attack caps to make use of that hammer.<br>

The proc does most of the damage. Just casting Yaulp V (no other haste), you swing with it every 1.5 seconds, or 40 times per minute. Test clerics have been reporting the hammer going off eight times per minute, or a 20% proc rate, with a very low resist rate on the procs.<br>
<br>
Defense is also being partially taken care of on Test. Shields give the Block skill to the user, which helps avoid a lot of damage. So the proposed soloing methodology is something like this:<br>
<br>
Pull with MoR or MoK. Channel a hammer pet onto the mob. Start banging away with hammer, Yaulping away. Put Epitaph on the mob as well if it's undead. Use stuns to further mitigate damage, and channel heals on yourself if required (can't root and back up to heal yourself without wasting the hammer pet). Since mobs are undead, running shouldn't be an issue. If it is, stun/root/Bash (clerics have Bash on Test, too).<br>
<br>
I personally think it blows. I'm not interested in replacing hard-earned gear (ok, the Wand was a gimmie, but still) with a summoned crutch. I'm not interested in casting Yaulp every 24 seconds whether I'm in melee or not for the mana regen. I'm not interested in going to one of the few places where I could solo with tactics like these and trying to find room with all the other soloists crowding these places. And I'm certainly not interested in a change to my class, a very social class which I picked for that reason, to make it a solo class.<br>
<br>
The main reason clerics get passed over for low blue XP grinds is we deal crap damage. Our massive healing abilities aren't really needed when the group is single-pulling low blues that get slowed ASAP, and that leaves nukes which are slow and inherently inefficient. And Mark of Retribution, which does poor damage if the mob is slowed (which it always is). <br>
<br>
Both clerics and druids (who formerly used damage shields for significant damage) would benefit from some sort of spell that adds damage to melee damage dealers and doesn't get reduced by slow. Something like a buff, along the lines of the SK/RNG self-buffs, which add a proc to whatever weapon the melee is using. For clerics, I envision some sort of magic-based DD proc; for druids, either a small fire-based DD or a small lifetap/heal proc (to augment druid heals). The buffs should be group buffs, and not have a long duration (long duration buffs like C3/Aego have only made caster grouping worse, not better). Have them be overwritten by SK/RNG self-only proc buffs.<br>
<br>
That would be a nice addition to my arsenal, and would actually address the real problem. Not create a whole new series of problems, to be bandaged over next patch.<br>

The DPS talked about on Test isn't great insofar as damage dealing goes. The numbers I've seen are around 1200 DPM with hammer melee, and the same with pet attacks. So about 40 DPS combined, for 250 mana plus lost med cost. Compare that with the other two priest classes, both of whom have right-click DoTs. With just epic and Velious bracer a druid is putting out half that! If that's the competition - and at level 56 when we get the new summoned hammer, it is - we don't stand a chance. People will only want to group clerics for &quot;tough&quot; stuff, and more and more with better gear and AAs there isn't much of that.<br>
<br>
Right now the proc buffs are self-buffs for SKs and rangers, and SKs actually get theirs from the parent class, necromancers. I think as long as the ones a cleric or druid could give were inferior to the hybrid ones, and didn't overwrite them, there wouldn't be too much envy. Paladins also get a few buffs like this, Divine Might/Instrument of Nife, and they don't stack with the SK buff so the stacking should be easy to code (/hug Lucy).<br>
