I guess it's pretty sad to be a LC cleric from the way you discribed.  When I was in VM, most of the time I see clerics couldn't get group because most group has a cleric already.  Whenever I tried to make group, almost always have at least 2 clerics wanna joni.  And VM was never known to have &quot;extra&quot; active clerics.  But still...they had more lfg clerics than number of xp groups.<br>
<br>
&quot;My best efficiency nuke is Judgement. I used to solo &quot;a small mushroom&quot; by standing and chain-nuking it with Judgement until it died. My recovery time from one blue kill was eight minutes, with two minutes to actually kill the thing. I could, at best, get two blues of AA XP per hour.&quot; etc etc ....<br>
<br>
Have you seen a druid solo mushroom? I tried that a while back, if i dont need to zone every 10 mins, xp probaly be pretty about the same as what you get. Druid's best solo xp is quad.  Cleric's best solo xp is UD.  But since you are not posting v.s. UD, there's really no point comparing what you post to druid quad. =) Repeat after me: ALL SOLO CLASSES HAVE THEIR LIMITS. A LOT OF CLASSES HAVE TO DEPENDS ON WHAT GEAR THEY HAVE TO SOLO!!  NO class can solo in all the zones.  e.g. Mushroom is not a place for druid!!!  you don't see shaman solo in the grey!!!<br>
<br>
&quot;Why? There's only so much healing you can have on a raid. It's not like clerics stack as well as DPS classes do on a raid - once you have enough clerics along, you're fine. The trouble is getting enough clerics to come along. <br>
<br>
/em points at LC rosters and see 19 active clerics. /grin no wonder you can't find group..j/k =P.  Just wanna tell you, that 20/30 clerics is not a number I randomly throw out. A good/perfect raid NEED that many clerics to support, esp if not all of them can play 24/7.  I understand what you meant by you can only use so much healing in a raid.  But honestly, how many guild can say they dont need more healing?  <br>
<br>
&quot;The sorts of people that think a cleric is required in some of the camps they ask for them to join aren't fun to group with. I think that's the most diplomatic way of putting it.&quot;<br>
<br>
You don't have to join them if you dont want.  Clerics can pretty much pick which pick-up group they want to join.  We all know about it. =)  <br>
<br>
&quot;Yes - your guild didn't have enough active clerics to raid the targets you wanted to kill. That's the problem. &quot;<br>
<br>
No, the problem again..is the raid depends on clerics too much.  There are 15 classes, if a 60 ppl raid need 12 clerics (just a number for easy calculation. in actual raid, usually about 9 to 10) to run smoothly--that's 20% need to be clerics.  That's just wrong.  In a perfect balance game...a 60 ppl raid will need 4 ppl from each class. Not 12 clerics + others. Stats never lie (but you can play around with it =P). just look at LC's rosters.<br>
<br>
&quot;get the rewards for raiding&quot;<br>
<br>
sorry, i dont raid for loots.  I want to play my main in a raid, not someone else's charactor.  <br>
<br>
Septeternal switched main because VM needed cleric and he was playing someone else's cleric (Sumer) every single raid.  So he said Fxxk it and start his own cleric because he WANTED to be able to play his own charactor in raid.  Ellise played Ary for about 6 months and almost thought she's a cleric. Luckily her husband came to save her.  I played Icant for 2 to 3 months and whine every day.  Prizm was always on Nida/yalla.  Zita when she plays, you would see Yalla.   There are more examples of couple ppl were forced to play cleric or switched to play cleric because guild needed help.  <br>
<br>
&quot;It's easy to burn out when your guildmates treat you like gold until the end of the raid, then forget you exist and leave you without a method of improving yourself via XP.<br>
<br>
LC really treated you like that?  o well...if you are really that un-happy, maybe time for a new guild.. j/k =D.  Most of the clerics I know were burn out from the pressure of being in CH rotation every single day--not from how they were treated.<br>
<br>
&quot;If your guild doesn't have enough clerics, it might just be because of how you treat the ones you do have. My guild has enough clerics, and we've heard the horror stories from the ones that left other guilds. Shouting at the healers whenever a raid goes south, then leaving them behind when you go to do alt XP isn't the way to make them feel happy playing EQ.&quot;<br>
<br>
Find me another guild with almost 20 active clerics like LC (wraith doesnt count!).   Of coz you have enough clerics.  Shouting at the healers is not a guild problem..it's just personal problem, some ppl just like to blame. if you tell me no one ever shout at healer in LC, then you are just lying.  Leaving cleric behind to do alt xp--isn't that what you were complainting about how LC treated you?  So...is LC treating you good or bad?  If LC treats clerics bad, how come they have so many clerics? If LC treats clerics good, what were you complainting about for the whole thread about not able to find group?<br>
<br>
&quot;They just DID give clerics a fun role - secondary damage from melee&quot;<br>
<br>
does that solve anything?  clerics will still be the &quot;healer&quot; in raid.  Would love to see your CH clerics run up and melee mobs.  As long as the clerics are still the only healer...you will still be CH bot in raid..no matter what VI give you.  And more clerics will still get burn out, you should know how stressful it is in CH rotation. one little mistake and the raid is gone.  And also...the nerf was a good one. no one should be able to use 5 pp to buy a spell from vendor and out dmg a well equipted pal. Maybe you will understand how pal felt if one day VI decided to give pal a store bought AE hp buff that overwrite and better than anicent aego for 5pp.  There are 2 extra dropped version of cleric hammer spells (lvl 58, 60) after the &quot;nerf&quot;--and i dont see a lot of ppl complaining.<br>
<br>
&quot;Seriously, though - you've seen a mass exodus of people that have left other serious mains to play clerics? &quot;<br>
<br>
of coz no..thx to VI quick fix.  seriously, you think the cleric melee improvement, the solo xp nerf, and the new cleric heal spells have not make a single person switch main? =P (see? you asked for mass exodus, i asked for single person. we all know that the extreme case will never happen.  bad arguements there!)<br>
<br>
&quot;No, because I don't think they are being treated like God. &quot;<br>
<br>
read through again..i first brought that up coz gimily said we should treat cleric like God (or treat them differently from other classes). then there was my arguement about why clerics shouldn't be treated like one and should be treated the same as other classes.  Then you joined in bah bah bah...but anyway, since you agree with me. that's good enough.  i dont care if they are being treated like God or not, just want to say they shouldn't be treated like one. If something is over power, it should be fixed. Can't let that stay in game for too long.  hehe..just think about how many ppl will be in VT if VI didn't fix the gimped emp fast enough.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, are we better than all the other players (druids, necromancers, etc.) that abandoned their class for something &quot;better&quot;?&quot;<br>
<br>
all of those ppl who abandoned their classes for something &quot;better&quot; don't love their old class as much as they claimed.  Why should clerics be treated otherwise?  Like I said, if you only want to play a class that's important--that means you don't really like cleric--you just want to play them coz they are important. I dont know how i can make it more clear with my english..but i am trying my best..hehe. But yes, I am not treating cleric differently or expect clerics should be the 'better players'. I am treating them THE SAME as other classes--if you really love you class, you will stay no matter what.  and those are the ppl who will belifit from less clerics in guild.<br>

And this post was directed at Mipp and Mipp alone.  I said this knowing full well that Mipp had access to not only a shaman, but the exact same shaman I used as well as many other characters.  That part was pretty much a conversation between Mipp and I so for lack of anything else better to say...fuck off.<br>
