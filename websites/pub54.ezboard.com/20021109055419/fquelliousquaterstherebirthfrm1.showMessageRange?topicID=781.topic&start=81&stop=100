I remember seeing assloads of these guys running around when i was trying to fend off the yellow centurians with my cracked staff on the orc hill back in the days.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think DoV might has some clout as one of the oldest guilds as well.  i remember camping the that orc trainer FOREVER (omg how could people have the patience to &quot;camp&quot; stuff for OMG 20 minutes straight) and the first person I ever saw with a last name came and Ksed my trainer!!!  and it dropped the SBS!!!  It was Sailador Starblade wielding the uberest of weapons.. no no not the langseax.. it was the SBH!  almost as cool as a PGT!.  Anyways that dick KSed my SBS =(  That was somewhere in july of 99.<br>
<br>
As for me having one of the first cleric epics.  Wll sorta.  I think I fit in more actually around number 10 or so.  However  i did complete my final battle with ragefire int eh number 4 or 5 slot before or after Nvenia.. i dont really remember this is like 2 friggin years ago.  Unfortunately some assmonkey in Sol B had a ninja looting mule named &quot;Darbura&quot; whose sole purpose was to log on for 30 seconds at a time to ninjaloot items from Ragefire and Nagafen.  He stole my heart and i had to wait nearly a month to be reimbursed and finish my epic.<br>
<br>
Hmm this leads to yet another story =P  I endevoured to catch this Darbura guy for 3 weeks on end.  I logged into Sol B for every dragon kill spamming &quot;/who all Darbura&quot; relentlessly during raids so i could get an idea of who was logging in and out, and who was always there in solb, and who it could possibly be that was doing this to people.  <br>
<br>
Some guy named Desi asked me for a res in Nektulous Forest, I didnt want to bother with it but he somehow convinced me to do this even though I needed to be in Sol B for my investigation.  The body somehow kept moving across zone after zone and somehow it ended up in Neriak Third gate.  I hate those corpses that skitter from zone to zone =P.  Bleh anyways I was in Neriak third gate spamming  &quot;/who all Darbura&quot; over and over again and of course the guy logged on and I never got to screenshot who was in sol b at the time.  And yeah i still hold that against Desi to this day =P.  <br>
<br>
No I had no idea what logging was at the time =)<br>
<br>
And yeah i am drunk again<br>

Any idea where Dykitana fits in Agui? I remember Dyki camping fay all the time (old skool fay) but losing out like to Shimulian RIGHT before the patch, and Dyki was like first or second (really think first...Khando or someone would remember) to get epic after the patch where they made druid epic easy. <br>

Kallia: Denia and Kron and Daranin use to tell me all the time that the first two guilds on the server were Nomad Souls and Stormriders. (Of course this is bias info..) But Denia swears that he would debate with SR all the time who was actually first that day. Daranin still has a website (nomad-souls.org) but he recently just changed it, and deleted the old stuff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I left Descent and joined Vis around April/May or something along those lines, Dykitana had epic before I left the guild. Faie, Tynan, and I (and I think someone else) were there when she got her Fay dragon, then ran to Kedge Keep and made me, Faie, Tynan, Choppa, and Alancia all help her get that weirdo fish piece there. Then went with her to turn it in. Think either Nida or Lenaleni was in Kedge Keep to, i dont remember. <br>

<br>
My original Surname was Mawina, yup, you got it Havusin Mawina (Have you seen my weiner?). I actually had my name picked out before I even played the game, other than <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> watching</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> tunset play his druid every night it seemed like. {On another side note I remember getting &quot;mad&quot; at him for quitting his druid when he was &quot;high level&quot; (20) to play his low level (5) warrior.} Kept it until 48 or so, was fletching when GM Mandybeth came in and told me it was time for it to move on (despite me giving them all plenty of laughs trying to BS them into thinking it was supposed to read &quot;Im a winner). I remember GM Ozzmar never &quot;got it&quot; and Mandybeth was telling me how they were all trying to explain to him how (and why) my name needed changing.  She did tell me that someone had petitioned for my name to be changed. I always wondered who that was.<br>
<br>
Anyway,  I wasnt allowed to use the /surname command and I couldnt think of one on the spot so a couple weeks later when moo was in full force it was only right for me to want a &quot;bovine&quot; surname.  I think originally I asked for &quot;Sanctus Bovinicus&quot; and damn my luck I got the one other person on the face of the planet that took Latin, and he happened to be the guide I applied to get the name from. We chatted for a bit, him probably having a &quot;no, you cant have that one hotkey&quot; with all the derivatives of cow, moo, and bovine I asked for.<br>
<br>
Finally,  I asked for Mooz. He said &quot;no&quot;. I said, &quot;type /who all Mooz&quot;, a short pause and then the reply &quot;you win&quot;, my surname appeared over my head within moments.  Mooz was always a good sport about it though. I may have stolen his name to some degree but I don't &quot;think&quot; there was quite the story behind all the Moo'ing going on before I (and Tun/Dand and the rest of the crew, of course) came along.<br>
<br>
Sorry to get off topic, but, well, you asked.<br>

..I guess I could mention that I was part of the winning team for the first ever 18 vs. 18 Test of Tactics, but then, that would sound egotistical, wouldn't it? *cough cough* No titles were given for that, though..<br>

I remember hurredly doing all these damn epic battles and thats all we ever did was get epics.  <br>
<br>
Quixotim did not have one of the first Paladin epics as he was not even recreated until velious came out, or perhaps slightly before.. <br>
<br>
I Am pretty sure Soulance got that epic first, shortly followed by Juzzam, I remember both of them coming up to fear for that part during DoV fear raids.<br>
<br>
I know Dorrin did not have the first swiftwind.  Damacles, Sherry, Tuldar, and Mwobley were before him in that, although he may have had the first completed set.<br>
<br>
Dayhawk and Udar belong somewhere in that first to 50 list.<br>
<br>
<br>
I believe i was also the 160th person to lvl 50!  um or something like that maybe add a zero =)  I do remember slowly leveling from lvl 15 down to 13 soloing corrupt guards in queynos over 3 weeks!<br>
<br>
I remember when i was a lowly lvl 15 in North karana kiting grifawns all day and Neeo living there giving me and my brother sow all day long, and he was killing the big stuff like Hill giants in 12 person groups!! =P.<br>
<br>
Draugrim came up to me and he conned RED!!  he recruited me to lag after him on my 166mhz computer for an hour so we could kill BIG STUFF like elephants!<br>
<br>
The very same day I was standing at the bridge and Valdayana ran at me in skeleton form and said &quot;BOO!&quot; and I about crapped my pants becasue i thought Lord Grimrot was after me!<br>
<br>
Somewhere in a junk heap in michigan lies a hard drive with screenshots of me with my back turned to a sand giant with its fist descending on my skull at lvl 8 or so, and my brother typing WATCH OUT SG!! ten times in a row, then shortly after my corpse and him laughing hysterically.<br>
<br>
I remember fighting in the mino caves for hours trying to collect as many mino axes as possible with Laughs so we could run all the way to Qeynos to sell them off for a 1pp profit.  That run was terrifying!  i was always scared King Xxrob would jump out and pummel me while running though the gorge....<br>
<br>
Btw has anyone ever seen King Xxrob, or figured out the mystery to making him spawn?  I heard he drops a PBB every time!!!<br>
<br>
<br>
um I had the first Akkirus BP if that means jackety dick!<br>
<br>
<br>
The most fun I ever had in EQ was ToT3!  I was shaking so much and nervous I almost vomited jsut from my nerves.  Hehe its hard to imagine me so riled up behind a keyboard having to breathe deeply at that moment the charge was called.  it was simply awesome! I never expected to make it beyond the server competition let alone advance to the semifinals on Rallos Zek.  We truly amazed ourselves against foes that equiped 2 times better than we were, and still are even a year later, as we had never been to VP or Ntov or ST.  We felt like we could really do anything if we could flow through so many victories against the odds we faced.  I am damn proud of that achievement!  We got beat by Afterlife in the end.  Right out of the gates Ulysse went splat from some sort of Vox tooth lifetap gangbang, followed by GM deathtouches for Drauggie and Brindor who went LD right on the charge.  <br>
   <br>
We fought them 15 vs 18 for the next ten minutes, and hope broke when thier necro Savan finally died after being beaten and cudgeled and stabbed for a total of 88k damage =P.  This guy had like 3200 HP unbuffed lol.  17 vs 15 now!<br>
<br>
Then Mithre was slaughtered, the exact method used i am nto sure of...it can be said of 18 vs 18 competitions that they are a bit chaotic with lots of yelling and screaming of plans on changing of plans and death reports and heal screams  =P.  So we are down to 17 vs 14!! booo!<br>
<br>
Next excuse!:  Altranyi shortly after recieved a GM Death Touch for &quot;excessive spamming.&quot;  he was clicking his jboots feverishly as the murderous hoard was on his heals clicking all of thier dispell wands feverishly =P.  Somehow he got singled out for this and got the spam DT, although standing in front of him at the time trying to heal him for the moment i was left alone he was simply running at normal speed clicking his booties for all he was worth trying to overcome the dispells.  Even our opponents cried out that this was an unfair call during the battle, but nothing to be done but keep fighting!!  17 vs 13!<br>
<br>
And this is where it ends =P  Final call, 2 Alliance killed, one AL killed, 3 Alliance deathtouched!  We were sad, but we were fully satisfied at making it that far at all, and losing to such a formidable opponent ....they were tough guys!  Damn I would love to try that match again =P.  man it was even relaly cool just to be runnign around the Karanas running into all these famous EQ superstars!!  I remember Andryl met his monk superhero (i dunno who it was) and then kicked his ass 2 times in a duel =P.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hmm ok so sorry about hijacking this thread and telling stories about stuff we did and being all proud and stuff.  Im not trying to brag really =P.. well maybe a little but mostly just remembering all that forced an avalanche of memories out, and I had to spew it all here to share it because just thinking about it made me excited all over again).<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading lol<br>

no i dont have any type of software which spellchecks =)  um this computer is for EQ.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uaxemb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AxemB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/25/02 8:30:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=781.topic&index=97>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: First Epics on Server... -- Updated 7/24 (Noon CST)</span><hr size=1> I remember you still Otzlee.
