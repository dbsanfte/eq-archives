 If this list can make a change for the better I say stick with it. God knows noone wants to sit in SF for a week waiting for a friggin mob to pop but thats the way it is so we deal with it.<br>
<br>
 They have company though, Dark Brigade sat for a week in SF in support of Prizmo and LV...when he popped there were many people to support him. We had an overwhelming # of people compared to LV but we would never think of ganking a mob we worked hard to defend the rights to. <br>
<br>
 So now it is Kidare of DB's turn and we sit yet another week while Darkdaimon and VoR give us support.....and on down the line.<br>
  <br>
 Does it suck for clerics who cant get it? Most definately but we play the game how it was designed. /shrug make all these mobs a triggered spawn from a hard quest that you dont have to camp items for days on end. <p>Sensei Bevery Entimahdayyted

I think it has had a major impact for the better on the rage camp. It not only establishes a system that can work, it lets separate guilds sit around and get to know each other. Nowadays it seems every guild for themselves and almost all raids on major mobs are guild only. This gives people a chance to mingle and talk. I have helped camp Rage 4 times now and this is the most enjoyable it has been out of all of them.<br>

I do see the growing of the list becoming a problem but I can't think of a solution to stopping that other than making rage a forced spawn with a much tougher Version 3.1b. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 439<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/19/02 9:13:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=310>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> Jesus God what a monster. <br>

You’re trying to pass what is true for your guild as true for all guilds. It is arrogant. Arrogant like assuming that anyone against the list is a prick due to the collective force supporting those fluffed egos on Cleric Hill.<br>

“To those of you out there who only look for negative things to say about the clerics in SF - well - so be it - I assume you are that way in real life also.”<br>

<br>
I would like it as much as non-rogues crying, “Nerf rogues!” But I would dislike a rogue getting started on the most difficult/bottleneck part first because he heard of something I had not even more. One may affect me, the other most certainly does.<br>
<br>
“If Rage went FFA it is far too easy now, for some guilds to monopolize the spawn with a trivial amount of effort. They would be irresponsible if they did NOT do so, to protect the interest of their clerics.”<br>
-- FK<br>
<br>
Rage is being monopolized--<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    that’s</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> what I have a problem with. Being monopolized by a class instead of a guild does not change the fact. It’s an exclusive group with exclusive “rights” to a mob enforced by large numbers of players. Those outside the group, regardless of the circumstances for not being on the list, would likely be the subject of threats/flames on Flame forums if not in-game should they be dastard enough to forgo the clerics’ okay.<br>
<br>
“If you don’t think it's fair, then draft up and implement a better plan. But guess what? You wont, cause you cant. You can’t do better. Simple.”<br>
-- Quas<br>
<br>
Will clerics even take a non-cleric’s suggestion seriously? I know one showed she won’t. For every suggestion tossed around there’s a reason why it won’t work: There’s no way to check everything’s done up to Rage--why bother asking the question?; You can cast Identify, but can you trust the caster?; Why should we re-roll?; Why should we random?; It’s not my fault you didn’t know about the list sooner…don’t try to bump me now, it’s my turn!<br>
<br>
“They run it as fair as possible (and if you don’t believe it's fair... then tell me how Fucktards like Prizmo and Mlain can get on it), and they enforce it.”<br>
-- Quas<br>
<br>
Fair is subject to opinion it comes to the list. You cannot quantify it. No one wants to even broach the idea of truncating the list by placing requirements on it. The slightest modification could topple guild support and lead to finger pointing by clerics like Prizmo and Mlain. IMO, most people would rather their ‘toon warm a spot for a few weeks than dwell on the subject of fairness, which has been brought up here over and over. That being said, I would still prefer it if someone had the balls to hit the breaks and say, “You, you, and you, you’re moved to the back, you don’t have everything up to Rage. You, &lt;insert asshole cleric&gt;, you damn well aren’t going to see Rage until everyone’s done.” Some discrimination is better than none. <br>
<br>
“People whine the Quellious is FFA, and why is that?”<br>

<br>
I’m not one of the whiners. General chaos did not ensue whenever Alliance entered NToV or HoT. <br>
<br>
“And who are they? I'll tell you that too. They are the people with the power to enforce their decisions. Well now... the clerics just showed up with a bigger force, and THEY are taking charge and making the policy when it comes to Rage.”<br>
-- Quas<br>
<br>
They were also the guilds to monopolize spawns. Same deal with clerics now. That they use this mob for their epic somehow makes it better?<br>
<br>
“Not everyone is supposed to have an epic. So if Joe Cleric has to wait 6 months, and then spend every day in Skyfire for 3-5 weeks prior to his/her turn, then why should anyone be exempt?”<br>
-- Quas<br>
<br>
Why do you or anyone get to decide Joe Cleric has to wait 6 months according to this list? Why do you get to decide he is in the wrong if he sits there for days, triggers, and kills Rage, bypassing the list?<br>
<br>
“No buts, STFU... cause I'm tired of hearing you whining.”<br>
<br>
Thanks Quas for the display of attitude responsible for moving this thread from the General forum.<br>
<br>
That’s it…I’m not going to quote anyone else. I’m sure good points have been made on the pro and anti side. I am not a demon anarchist trying to singe clerics with the sharp and scalding end of my pitchfork. Rage is monopolized. It doesn’t sit well with me, doesn’t diminish the inherit wrong no matter what the “reasons” and “VI justifications” behind it. When the list was agreed upon by a few they didn’t automatically run out and announce the new de facto entitlement they were reserving for themselves, else they would've been laughed out of town. They served their best interests by approaching friends and guild mates with the idea, people likely to agree back with them and further gain support to enforce their desires instead of doing the right thing, the “fair” thing, and making as much noise as possible before assigning numbers. I’ve only noticed Belhaven take it upon himself to make some noise. That’s more than I can say for most that claim to care so much.<br>

When epics came out guilds able to compete with the mob but not other guilds lost every time until the stronger guild was done outfitting its members with epics. I don't think there's been anything said on the thread to support a cleric being blacklisted. On the contrary, people keep pointing out an undesirable cleric that was able to kill Rage with everyone's help, and otherwise only able to kill Rage due to the list. I am not against excluding/blacklisting a cleric based on what step of the epic they're on. Sue me, but I believe a level 60 main has &quot;earned&quot; their shot at Rage, for all intents and purposes, over a level 50 twink 2-boxed as a guild extra.<br>

This list while starting off honorably did save from ganking, it is causing yet a bigger headache. Erase the list and start over and you piss people off.  Keep going with the list that was only known to folks that read this board and yet again you piss people off. <br>

What is going to make this &quot;list&quot; go away is the fact that it was never known.

In any case it's only a monopoly inasmuch as they will try to make bucking it untenable. Hopefully too difficult to bother with, but nevertheless not impossible. Possible to compete means it can't be a monopoly. But they don't have to make it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> easy</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and hopefully they won't.<br>
<br>
It's really not a monopoly but a coop. You can try to sell your corn outside of the coop but the coop will collude to undercut you until you either join also or go out of business. Possibly a big conglomerate (uberguild) can come and challenge the coop, but the coop can at least hopefully at least <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> survive</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. If the coop is maintaining a fair price and only trying to keep the farmers in business in a fair way they probably will last. If the coop becomes corrupted or starts gauging then they open themselves to being wiped out by the conglomerates.<br>

I'll assume you meant to say coup instead of a chicken pen. A coup alone is a brilliant act, so again I'll assume you imply that what the clerics have done is closer to a coup d'état. Except the clerics did not overthrow any recognized system before they took over. Therefore a more fitting description would be a cartel.<br>
<br>
OPEC is the only openly defiant cartel to my knowledge. Although Arabian nations are not the only source of oil, they supply the bulk of it and would likely love to have a complete monopoly with the global political pull it promises. But there is only one Rage per server, and catching the clerics off guard with a snag here and there should not be taken as an indication that they will lighten up on the list or are willing to &quot;share.&quot; As long as they have the backing that enables them to enforce their own rules it's a monopoly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=465.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=465.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=14><img src=http://quellious-collective.com/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=465.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=465.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=465.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=465.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.0.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href=http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html>JXEL</a></center></body></html>
