Even post nerf hammer is fun as hell.  I've been a soloing machine.  Long gone are my times of sitting in CT with the LFG tag up while I yak with all my old hunting buddies that left for VM.  Now I can aaxp to my hearts content &quot;efficiently&quot; and still yak with all my old hunting buddies.<br>

Instead of so much hate, be happy for the ppl that now don't have to depend on 5 other ppl to get some xp.  My twink ranger is actually goin back to the backseat a little more now.<br>

(And as far as all the talk about clerics whined to VI til they finally got something...ummm...druids and shamans are the ones that sent in the petition to VI, not us.)<br>

It's brilliant!&quot;<br>
<br>
of coz it is.  you dont think the problem with clerics is that they are too important?  if guild raid only need 4 or 5 clerics, you think clerics will still have a hard time finding a group in guild?  i dont mind clerics getting solo power, not that they can't solo already. but you have to open your eyes, if cleric becomes very good at solo and still the only good healer in raid, you will start seeing 20, 30 clerics in a guild..you think that will help clerics finding group?  EDIT: I think clerics usually have no problem finding pick up group, but i would think clerics would love to hunt with their guildmates more most of the time.<br>
<br>
&quot;The people who play clerics tend to LIKE playing clerics. What they don't like is everyone leaving them all alone after raiding is done because they might slow down that all important XP/second.&quot;<br>
<br>
Talk to those ppl who have to play another person's clerics for raid just becoz they HAVE to inorder for raid to continue (eg. me!).  I would think ppl like to play their own charactor more than another person's.  I never like playing cleric, but because i have access to one, i was asked to play cleric a lot of time.  See anything wrong there?  How many ppl you know started a cleric twink not because they like it, but just because they are more needed?  I know quite a few of them.  How many clerics you know switched to another class because they are burn out?  If a class is buring out ppl, there's something wrong. I don't see a lot of other classes burning out ppl like clerics.  So...ppl who don't want to play clerics are forced to play clerics, ppl who love to play clerics are burn out from it.  And you are saying that's ok?<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd say you obviously didn't try hard, but I don't know you well enough to know if that's true or not.&quot;<br>
<br>
yeah..i didn't really try very hard.  but there's no point of trying if ppl don't want to accept the real problem with clerics--they are too important. Spread the healing out and VI can give more fun/useful spells or some other fun role for clerics. Until then, if you just keep giving clerics more and more, it will just become an endless cycle--more ppl play clerics, clerics having harder time to find group, more clerics quit,VI give clerics more, repeat.<br>
<br>
&quot;Agreed! So these soloists should allow clerics to join them, since nobody should discriminate based on the actual utility of a character! Ah, but people DO discriminate based on utility, don't they? When a group wants a damage dealer, they don't go get a bard. When they want a healer for raids, they don't get a druid. And when they want healing for XP grinds against low blues, they don't get a cleric.&quot;<br>
<br>
so..you basically just avoid my whole point and put up and counter example that has nothing to do with my point.  My point is clerics shouldn't be treated like god just because they are clerics--any arguement for that?<br>
<br>
&quot;Take that away and you'll see all clerics disappear, because there'd be no fucking reason to play one&quot;<br>
<br>
then you probably don't love your class as much as you think. or your main reason for playing clerics is just to feel important.  either way, same conclusion. those who love their class will stick with it no matter what.<br>

then you don't know me very well.  I play to raid, I play to chat with friends, I play for fun. Phat lewtz is a bonus. If I play for phat lewtz, you would see me still in VM-where i can pretty much get whatever i want. most important, if i play for phat lewtz, i won't be still playing druid...<br>
<br>
&quot;If you didn't you'd all be killing Nexus Scions instead of Avatar of War.&quot;<br>
<br>
You can't kill nexus scions any more if i remember correctly..and AOW is 10 times more fun than killing nexus scions. at least AOW is not rooted...<br>
<br>
&quot;I wasn't saying that all I am after is phat letwz...what I was saying was appreciating the clerics out there because THEY are what makes the endgame possible for EACH and EVERY one of us.&quot;<br>
<br>
I apprecite all the clerics. but not only them. I apprecite every single class and every single player in the raid.  Clerics are not the only one who make endgame possible. try bring  200 clerics and no other class to a raid and see what you can kill.  Why should we assprecite 1 class so much and ignore all others?  Find me another class where the whole guild will drop whatever they are doing anytime and go camp a mob for epic.  Try talk to some high end war who doesn't have epic but would still like to get a hold of one if possible.  The double standard is just wrong.  Also...maybe you are in a huge guild where you have no problem finding enough clerics to play everyday. But even in VM, our raid usually consist of 2/3 real clerics and 1/3 clerics bot/played by other ppl.  Maybe i should appreciate the clerics more for letting other ppl play their charactors..althought i dont think they want that to happen.<br>

<br>
No, I don't. I think the problem is the cleric is only truly useful/able in one area, raiding. Anything else a cleric is good at isn't terribly valued. So once the raid is done, we get left out.<br>
<br>

From Sunday: /who all Lotus 60, too many people to count. /who all cleric Lotus, three clerics: me, one heading to Ssra, one AFK in Nexus. No /anon clerics online. Any groups available? Nope. Later on, a warrior logged on and logged on his bot cleric to go solo rather than take a guildmate healer. None of the other people online were LFG, so I can't put together a guild group. After an hour and a half online, a spot for a &quot;healer&quot; opened up, and if I didn't send the tell as fast as I did and sound sad when they were about to reject me the spot would have gone to a shaman that was soloing in the area.<br>
<br>
This is typical. This is what I see day after day. People want maximal XP/unit time, and that pretty much excludes me coming along. Too many people to count online, space for one cleric. And reducing our numbers would help?<br>

My best efficiency nuke is Judgement. I used to solo &quot;a small mushroom&quot; by standing and chain-nuking it with Judgement until it died. My recovery time from one blue kill was eight minutes, with two minutes to actually kill the thing. I could, at best, get two blues of AA XP per hour.<br>
<br>
There is gear that allows one to solo better than that. Clerics in guild with the Hammer of the Sun and C3 can rot three Sun Revenants in The Grey at a time, and clerics with Faithstones and Manastones can also rack up a more reasonable kill rate. The Hammer of the Sun is a drop off a Ssra named, and some servers don't even have Manastones. A class that has its soloing ability so limited to specific, rare drops isn't a solo class.<br>

Why? There's only so much healing you can have on a raid. It's not like clerics stack as well as DPS classes do on a raid - once you have enough clerics along, you're fine. The trouble is getting enough clerics to come along.<br>

<br>
Yes - your guild didn't have enough active clerics to raid the targets you wanted to kill. That's the problem. <br>
<br>
I will also note that at the end of the raid, not only do you get the DKPs/credit for being there, but you can even get Woow CotH'ed to the corpse (depending on the zone) if you want to spend those points and loot something. So it isn't fun for you to be a cleric, but you still get the rewards for raiding. I have yet to figure out a way to play an alt and still get XP for my cleric, or how I can get CotH to XP.<br>
<br>

I know two people that have serious cleric alts. One switched classes when his old main got stuck in Hate for three months (don't ask) and the cleric alt outlevelled the original main. The other still plays his paladin as the main, but I think his cleric alt will eventually become the main. In both cases the player switched to the cleric not just because it was a &quot;needed class&quot;, but because they felt their old class was a useless POS. I imagine the reason most people switch is because their original class was considered worthless - is that why Septeternal switched over (to name someone you know that switched)?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I know quite a few of them. How many clerics you know switched to another class because they are burn out?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A fair number, like Gimily. It's easy to burn out when your guildmates treat you like gold until the end of the raid, then forget you exist and leave you without a method of improving yourself via XP.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If a class is buring out ppl, there's something wrong.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes, there is. There's no options for clerics to solo, and there's no reason to add such a low DPS class to a group killing easy stuff for XP. Giving clerics DPS actually fixed both of those problems. Late last night I was asked to go kill Sun Revenants with someone that would never have asked, except he'd seen the damage output of his close friend's hasted, Avatar'ed cleric versus the undead.<br>

<br>
If your guild doesn't have enough clerics, it might just be because of how you treat the ones you do have. My guild has enough clerics, and we've heard the horror stories from the ones that left other guilds. Shouting at the healers whenever a raid goes south, then leaving them behind when you go to do alt XP isn't the way to make them feel happy playing EQ.<br>

<br>
They just DID give clerics a fun role - secondary damage from melee - and everyone else immediately asked for it to be nerfed! As long as clerics have CH, and two invulnerability spells, and plate armour, they will be the healing class of choice for single targets. Doesn't matter what anyone else gets, we can completely heal a single target and survive any resultant aggro so we're the go-to healer. So it's time to look for the secondary spells now so clerics aren't a one-trick pony.<br>

And we have a fair number of people that left old mains, mostly druids and necromancers with the odd wizard and ERU PAL.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My point is clerics shouldn't be treated like god just because they are clerics--any arguement for that?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No, because I don't think they are being treated like God. In fact, I'd say this is the first time clerics have ever been tossed something neat. They certainly aren't treated like gods by their guilds, or else there wouldn't be a problem with clerics being abandoned en masse when raiding is over for the day. Do you have any arguement for THAT?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Take that away and you'll see all clerics disappear, because there'd be no fucking reason to play one&quot;<br>
<br>
then you probably don't love your class as much as you think. or your main reason for playing clerics is just to feel important. either way, same conclusion. those who love their class will stick with it no matter what.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Why, are we better than all the other players (druids, necromancers, etc.) that abandoned their class for something &quot;better&quot;? I want to play EQ. Not sit on the sidelines, seeing if I can get all my tradeskills to 200 while everyone else is out doing stuff. I want to play. If the class I'm playing doesn't allow me to do that, I'll switch.<br>

<br>
I play a cleric and a druid as well, I feel it is a good balance.  If I want to solo I play the druid, if I am pissed off and want to just slash things up or just feel like messin around I play the warrior, and if I feel like playing more of the support role I play my cleric.  Grats to the clerics that got the upgrades, hope you all enjoy them, but I just think they wont last that long. <p><html>

At level 56, same level I get the hammer, I also get a nuke for 925. The hammer isn't what kills stuff. It's just fun. The pet and MoR are the real killers. I'm thinking of buying a shaman damage potion just to experiment and see how much the damage shield is doing.<br>

<br>
Clerics were not getting xp groups as easily as some of the other healer classes.  Go ahead and say how much bs that is, but you know it's true.  Shaman had replaced clerics as the first choice as the healer in groups.  Shaman have uber buffs, slow (so there's less damage to groups), haste (so mobs die faster), and with canni less down time.  Clerics have become a burden to xp groups due to our lack of contribution.  <br>
<br>
Sure, we could nuke a mob while grouped to help mobs die faster, but with our spells being nonefficient on mana, that just ends up with more down time for the group while the wizzycleric meds.<br>
<br>
So instead of sitting at a zoneline for hours on end with the LFG flag up, some of us clerics decide to solo so we can get xp.  You see, we need xp too so we can lvl/increase mana/aaxp.  If we're not invited into xp groups, then what other way are we supposed to lvl?  Sure, if you want to solo you can &quot;log in your druid&quot;, but that still doesn't get xp for your cleric.<br>
<br>
Everyone of you has stated that clerics are so important on raids, but guess what?  We need xp so we can achieve a lvl where we're helpful to the raid.<br>
<br>
Soloing...<br>
<br>
Prehammer...I could do 1 dk blue mob or 2 lt blue mobs on basically 1 bar of mana.  Kill 1 mob and then sit for an eternity for my mana to regen.<br>
<br>
With hammer...I can do 2 dk blue mobs (3 if I get really lucky), or 3-4 lt blue mobs.  Ooooo...I'm almost up to druid soloing capability.<br>
<br>
I do think that VI could have done something different besides the proc'ing hammer of doom (make us better nukers, but then nukers and druids would be complaining) but they didn't.  If it woulda been me, I woulda just made a huge upgrade in the undead line of spells (more damage/less mana), but I guess that woulda made too much sense.<br>
<br>
Ppl say we're too close to infringing on paladins.  I agree with that some, but I don't think paladins are in any danger of losing their role in groups/raids as MA and OffTank.  Clerics don't have the defensive skills of a pally.  Clerics don't have the offensive skills of a pally.  Clerics don't have the hp/ac of a pally.  Clerics don't have the button of death...&quot;taunt&quot;.<br>
<br>
Like others, when I started my cleric back in early 2000 (first toon, and still my main) I had pictured the cleric as the AD&amp;D type of cleric.  Around lvls 20-30 I realized that clerics in EQ weren't as great at melee as I pictured them to be (due to AD&amp;D stereotyping).  But I modified my role and learned to be just a healer.  Now, after 2 1/2 years of just sitting on my butt and medding, standing only when I need to heal or cuz I got hit, I get to have a little fun.  And isn't that what it boils down to?  Having fun?<br>
<br>
Anyway...flame me...tear my post to bits and quote every little line...whatever it is you need to do to make yourself feel better, I'm gonna log in and try to get bash to 150. <p><Br><img src="http://home.houston.rr.com/danday/gaeaan/Frankenstein.jpg" border="0">
