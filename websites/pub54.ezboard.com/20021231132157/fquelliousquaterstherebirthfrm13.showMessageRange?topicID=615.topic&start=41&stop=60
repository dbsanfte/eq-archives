Telling me that you &quot;live&quot; on a 127 acre farm is equivalent to saying you pump gas. Congrats! At the age of 18 I singlehandedly lived on, farmed, and maintained all equipment associated with a 220+ acre farm, while tending for sick loved ones at the same time. How dare you think your weak claim of &quot;Living on a big farm&quot; will intimidate me! Please! Sister, if you want to start throwing cookies, you will have the cookie pan in your face before you start. /quote<br>
<br>
Turtle,  try getting a clue or perhaps  actually  read  Aria's post before  merely responding with a lame wannabe flame attempt.  Didn't strike me as  bragging on her part, merely an attempt by her to show that, while yes she is  60+   that it didn't happen overnight and that  she spends alot of time doing meaningful things in real life.<br>
<br>
 But anywaz,  far  as your claim of what you did at 18?  I probably  could point out,  that i was raised on a farm, was hand planting tobbacco plants  around  3-4 years of age, driving a tractor by the time  i could stand on the brake/clutch to stop the tractor and  by  15 was working part time  delievering  papers, on other farms, in accounting and taking any other jobs i could get..... But i won't, not gonna stoop to the  &quot;my dick is bigger then yours&quot; mentality of your response to aria.<br>
 Far as impudent goes.  Hell ya alot of  lvl 58+ ppl in game are snob's,jerks,idiots,morons or  a dozen other names you wish to think up, but then again i met  just as many people from lvls 1-50 that acted the same way.... Humans, in general  ( Oh damn, i just made a generalization)  are  STUPID.  They predominately show no thinking skillzs, in terms of problem solving and will quickly  latch on to any  strat, tactic or method proven or suggested to solve a puzzle, encounter or delimma  they face.<br>
 Just ignore these people and they tend to fade away and for the ones that don't..... Well, train me once shame on you.  Train me  twice and  you better be bound in a safe spot, because i can be a  vindictive asshole when i get pissed.<br>
  Insults, lol words are only insulting if  YOU choose to let them be...  Translation:  You have the power to be affected or unaffected by mere words as YOU choose... So for all those times you got mad  because  a player didn't rez.buff,heal,port,x-loc or otherwise bend over backwards to HELP you..  All i can say is,  BOOHOO, go back to your mommy and  have her  put your pacifier back in.<br>
  Now far as being trained goes..... Bad pulls happen, stupid pulls happen even more so....  Use your brain to think and don't fight in a spot that is  right beside a zone line or in a direct line to a zone line...  Hell, a little common sense outta tell you that someone  in fear of dieing is gonna run the straightest, shortest distance they have to to reach safety, which in this game is usually a zone.... But, by damn, if you people don't continue to fight at the zone lines for your safety, while  bitching your arse off everytime someone else runs into problems and comes running to zone to save themselves.... It's a 2 way street here people and at least trying to use your head to think instead as a hat rack will go along ways towards making the game fun for you and lowering your frustration,anger lvl at other folks.<br>
  In the end this is just a game, no one is gonna remember what any &quot;toon&quot; did  in a couple months after  EQ goes offline..  Play to have fun, don't sweat the small stuff and  do a reality check once in awhile.. <br>

<br>
Just to clarify.. since alot of people have seemed to miss it, I will rez anyone I am grouped or raiding with.  For everyone else, I'll find myself too busy to be bothered to help you.  (and yes, a few people have already been told this)<br>
<br>
Don't flame Act because he took a stance of understanding what I am refering to.<br>
<br>
Erana, Did I hurt your small insignificant feelings? Your 60+, what do I care.  (Hurts being generalized doesn't it?)<br>
<br>
Ari, your damn straight I am angry.  I play this game to have fun, meet, talk, play with all kinds of people.  Yet because I haven't been playing for 3 years, I am not some uber toon with massive amounts of AA points, people try to keep me under them so not to have to deal with me on an even keel.<br>
<br>
Gaelron, you absolutely right.. most groups won't turn down a 56+ cleric in their group.  Change that level to a 55, well, you go test the waters.. Cuz dam, it sure gets cold fast.<br>
<br>

Interesting how you appear to be just as biased as everyone else, yet claim not to be.<br>
<br>
For all you others that see my &quot;point&quot;, thank you. and congrats..<br>
<br>
For all of you who don't.. (zeik).. piss off...<br>
<br>
YOU don't know me, so please, continue to judge my playing ability.  It just makes you look like a bigger ass then you make yourself out to be. (At the LEAST, ask your own guild members if I can play my toon, before you TRY bashing my abilities)<br>
<br>
Go make your pocket clerics, call your guildie clerics or whatever else you do.  Continue to interupt others or go through the aggrevation of logging another comp just to rez your stuck up ass.<br>
<br>
I have SEEN level 60 clerics that make me ashamed to be a cleric!  I know how to play my class, and do it VERY well.  (ok, so wizards and enchanters tend to die with 3 mobs beating on them, never claimed to be perfect)<br>
<br>
I have been actually fortunate enough lately to show quite a few level 60+'s, that just because I ain't lvl 60, doesn't mean I can't keep you alive.  UNBUFFED, I have 246 wisdom with about 300+ mana items (unsure of exact number).  And that is WITH wearing resist gear!<br>
<br>
Qulitos, I am sorry you had to witness it for yourself.  But, now you have kind of a first hand look as to what I face on a daily basis.<br>

You shot yourself in the foot with this one.  YOU dont know 95 + percent of the people you are generalizing and 'boycotting' with your little petty actions, and are not only judging their playing ability but their opinions, ethics, and morals in this game (as well as prejudging whether or not they would let a &lt; 55 lvl cleric in their group when you dont know them).

<br>
You missed the point...you do NOT have to be a hardcore uber gamer to be over level 60 and not all people over 60 are asses.  Go to OT, LOIO, DSP, DL...most people will choose a higher level toon of any class over someone lower in level of the same class.  Quilitos...have you never seen people in KC laugh at anyone under 49 who tries to get a group.  I couldn't get into US and UD even at 58 unless there was a good enchanter or people knew me because you NEED to be 59 to single pull those camps in Velks.  We've all been there.  The &quot;we'd like someone higher&quot; mentality is not restricted to the Planes.  <br>
<br>
Ravenblade is right, we are all human..we can be cruel and thoughtless...and yes tactless.  Maybe some people should all try to be a little more sensative, you just can't control everyone's actions...especially in this forum.  <br>

Impudent, having been 54 for a LOOOOONG time I can certainly sympathize with you. Even before luclin came out getting groups is a pain. Being in a guild of friends helps with that a LOT if you're with the right crew. All I can say is experiment with what zones you hunt in and you'll find a group groove for each level. I made it to 61 and you can to. Though pissing off the general population of the server probably won't help your cause. It took me a little over 2 years to make 60 but I'm living proof that someone over the brink of the &quot;casual&quot; gamer can actually have success in the game.<br>

I support myself thank you very much.  Yes, I do find adults playing EQ very lame.  I respect adults who do constructive things.  And no, sitting at home to keep the kids out of trouble doesn't constitute this.  So that's where life ends up, playing EQ as an adult to avoid daily conundrums?  That's no life.<br>

<br>
Why not?<br>
<br>
If I was a good little Shmuck, I'd sit back relax, let aggrivation set in, be mean to the ENTIRE server and have a generally piss-poor attitude.<br>
<br>
However, by actually SPEAKING my mind, I bring to light situations that run rampant among the &quot;elders&quot; on our server.  So what if I piss you off!  Maybe.. JUST MAYBE, I get 1 or 2 of you to take a step back and look at the &quot;status quo&quot; and THEN.. god forbid you see it from my perspective.  THEN.. MAYBE, the cold day in hell occurs when you say, &quot;ya know.. maybe that little piss-ant was right!&quot;<br>
<br>
At that point, it no longer becomes all for naught.  I refuse to allow people to push me into a corner and to be told to shut up/grin and bear it/be a troll.. whatever.<br>
<br>
That is my point.. I am here to stay.. and it is obvious that some people dont like it.   Nor do they like the fact that I have a VERY harsh way of bringing up situations that the general populous overlooks because the are too busy trying to look down their nose... god help them when they trip!<br>

Don't want it? Don't read on.<br>
<br>
Kids are stupid. They're always running around with their sticky hands and filthy Star Wars toys, completely oblivious to their surroundings. Irresponsible, lazy, and worthless. I saw a kid on a Chex commercial today. The kid was laughing. Laughing because he likes the noise it makes when he eats cereal. The kid was trying to be cute and funny, but ended up being annoying and repulsive. The commercial gave me diarrhea. <br>
<br>
You know.. you're pretty much a pile of shit if you're content with living your life eating cereal and laughing at the noise it makes. Why don't these worthless kids get a job? Child labor laws--my ass. We need to make new child labor laws, forcing kids into work at an early age. If their backs don't hurt, then they aren't earning their living. <br>
<br>
I mean, kids need real jobs. None of this selling lemonade at the corner of the street bullshit that they do now. The other day, some ugly little kids were trying to sell piss-warm lemonade to people driving by. Like anyone's going to go out of their way to stop, buy some diseased sugar water with dead flies in it, just to help out a group of dirty little shits that don't have anything better to do.<br>

Yes in fact I have Ari but it has never been to the extent of what happened last night.  When people are in /ooc making fun of her for being there, calling her worthless, etc. it is uncomparable to the simple &quot;Lol you can't fight here noob&quot; you get from places like KC.<br>
