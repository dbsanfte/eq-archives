Shit, if its really that important, I know every time I've ran thru Oasis lately (which is rare, though) I've seen Cazel up...it is just a freaking spoon, and like its been said earlier, its easily gotten...if I see him up, I'll freaking call you if it'll make you happy...I don't even think any more of our chanters need the stupid thing, but I may be wrong.<br>
<br>
My whole thing was the Hate raid. I did'nt ever /ooc anything to UP while we were there, all I did was casually come over and /yawn at the ones still standing there (and checking our pile of NPC corpses, I reinterate!) for pulling such a bullshit stunt. Hell, I could run straight through the middle of the zone and not pull THAT much aggro, I'm serious about that one.<br>
<br>
And I gave love to the chanters, read up a little bit. I gave love to our chanters that kept that nasty mess mezzed. I did also state that it was a game, so what if I used an extreme comparison? Ok, so a guy steals a Coke and a candy bar from a store...we don't let that kind of loopy shit pass either, right? Extreme measures call for extreme comparisons, my momma always told me.<br>

Would she have won? No prolly not, but she was actively trying and therefore you should have A. waited for her to go OOM and die/zone. B. help her or C. just leave.<br>
<br>
Cazel is a very Iffy spawn...some times hes up ALL the time, and others, he doesnt show his ugly self for a week.  I've camped him for my chanter in the past and I've helped other chanters do it as well.  To say that &quot;it's only Cazel&quot; or &quot;it's just a droppable spoon&quot; is just ignorant.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what bad blood your two guilds have, this type of action is unacceptable, especially after reading a Radiant flame a lil while back where Radiant Folks bitched out ADD folks for stealing the shissar wraith in PoF after a radiant member had already engaged it.  Yeah harder mob and rarer, but same basic principle.  Seems to me this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black.<br>

I was in Oasis with my druid and a monk friend tracking for Cazel.  I was there a good part of the evening.  <br>
<br>
I struggle with this issue for a couple different reasons.  Initially, I felt kinda bad for the chanter, because I know how I felt when it happened to me (and it has).  Fact is, I had been camping him all evening as well.  Someone was getting a spoon, it boiled down to me.  Amaya's guild did not come to help her.<br>
<br>
1.) I've been camping a spawn (Vessel Drozlin) and had someone else take the kill from me because I didn't have sufficient force in the zone before they did, and thereby lost the kill.  I had to stand there and watch him go down while my group was close.  It's the nature of the race game.   <br>
<br>
2.) The engagement rule .. hmm, I know this is a common practice to engage and kite a mob until you can get sufficient force in zone to kill it.  Personally, I don't engage a mob I can't kill.   I know others do, but I personally don't think its' the right thing to do.  Here's who was online in Unruled Power and their location when this all happened.  It is clear to me that Amaya could not have EVER solo'd Cazel.  It is also clear to me that her guildmates were not mobilizing to assist her.   <br>
<br>
--(60 Assassin) Macvalor (Half Elf): Zone: Maiden<br>
--(60 Virtuoso) Ulwern (Wood Elf): Zone: Burning Wood<br>
--(60 Oracle) Shmeep (Barbarian): Zone: Nexus<br>
--(55 Myrmidon) Korgathe (Iksar): Zone: Oasis<br>
--(Anonymous) Rubiee <br>
--(57 Luminary) Proman (Ogre): Zone: Chardok<br>
--(57 Revenant) Zexu (Dark Elf): Zone: Dreadlands<br>
--(Anonymous) Amaya (was in Oasis fearing Cazel)<br>
--(52 Heretic) Makraiza (Iksar): Zone: Najena <br>
<br>
3.) Had the situation been reversed... I wouldn't have engaged what I couldn't kill.  I'd have called upon my guild for help and kept sight of the target until I could engage it.   Which is what I did in this instance as well.  Had I engaged the giant that I couldn't kill, would UP have killed it?  I sure think so.  <br>
<br>
Amaya and I reached Cazel at about the same time.  He was close to me when he popped.   It is my belief she engaged it when she saw me.  He was not snared at any time, so when she feared it, it took off like a shot and the paladin (non-guildy whom she /ooc'd to come help her)  couldn't keep up with it to do damage.  He was low level paladin as well.  I watched this go on for quite some time, never seeing Cazel go below 99% life.   When Radiant arrived, she was given time to seriously engage.  I'm sorry, but I don't believe anyone would let me kite him around for an hour while they tried to get enough people in zone to kill him.   20 minutes is plenty of time to mobilize a group of people.  Try kiting Lodi around for 20 minutes and see where it gets you.  <br>
<br>
As far as Hate goes, yes they were deliberately training the hell out of Radiant.   But I didn't think Hate was the purpose of this rant.  <br>
<br>
Lastly, I stand by and support the members of my guild.   Flame them.  Flame me.  I know where my friends are at the end of the day.  <br>

It's a prerogative. You can choose not to kite or can choose to kite. What you feel with regards to kiting <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> has no bearing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on the rightness of wrongness of it when someone else does it. In other words, your personal approach to kiting doesn't validate a goddamn thing. <br>

I could reply that there may have been /anon members out, or twinks without tags online. Whatever the circumstances may have been, you, darling, don't get to decide when it's time for someone else to throw the towel in. You stand back and wait for your chance. You're not so much more deserving that you can KS it and walk away without getting called on it here (yes, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> KS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, because there is no &quot;somewhat&quot; KS.)<br>

&quot;It is my belief she engaged it when she saw me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Psst, it's called taking first aggro on an outdoor mob. I guess all those people KSed on Lodi don't have a reason to gripe since a group can never tell exactly where the turtle will spawn, and regularly has to be kited until the group arrives/is ready. Tsk, tsk. Whiners.<br>

Erana: Radiant camped Rage twice pre-list. The only issue there was that a cleric who hadn't been online for more than a handful of hours a day (and hadn't been there as long as our clerics) tried to claim the camp. He never had a group of guildies in the zone, except when Rage was due to spawn. Radiant, however, maintained at least a 1-group presence at all times. The cleric has since quit the game, but the guild he was in? ADD. <br>
<br>
Hell, on the first camp, said cleric forced a GM-sponsored roll between the two campers. Our cleric rolled a 36. He rolled a 30. And still hung around until Rage popped, and was upset that he didn't get it.<br>
<br>
That's a stupid and entirely uninformed thing to bring up. There was certainly no issue, save what one person with no legitimate claim on the camp chose to make.<br>
<br>
And as for the incidents in fear... wha? Care to explain?<br>

<br>
In Hate : Yes we were trained. There is no way you are going to get 15+ mobs back to your camp with a monk pulling unless you want them there. No it wasn't our agro from running the walls, we didn't have any mobs following us they showed up well after we go into camp.<br>
<br>
Cazel : Not sure what I am supposed to feel bad about... Killing a mob that someone else couldn't? I do feel bad that the enchantress doesn't have a guild that will help her like ours. I am sorry she didn't have the people to help her but that is her choice in who she is friends with.<br>
<br>
Arrogance.. Yup or confidence. Didn't know it was arrogant to say you won't engage a mob you can't kill. Sounds like common sense to me. Sure sometimes you push the envelope but I dont go in to ME and pull a mob solo b/c I can't kill it. just like an enchanter with a guild that won't help shouldn't pull Cazel.<br>
<br>
If Radiant has such a bad reputation why do so many people want to join. Strange that... Old School people may not want to join b/c they think they are so high above everone else to join such a &quot;lowibe&quot; guild but where have all those guilds gone? LC is doing VT, who else? Playing EQ a long time doesn't make you smarter.. just makes your characters older.<br>
<br>
Eh... Whiners. Humm... I didn't see Radiant post first about &quot;oooo you trained our hate raid WAAAAHH&quot; No I saw UP post about &quot;WaaaaaH! You KS'd a mob our single ench with her lvl 40 pally friend couldn't kill!&quot; Yup.. Whine on you Crazy Diamond..  <p>Madoc <br>

<br>
Radiant is a medium sized guild yet they managed to take down a mob like Vindi (yes I know it is easy for some guilds but was Radiant's first try). <br>
<br>
<br>
however wasnt it stated earlier that you could not kill him previously so had to get a strat? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=167569">Lormif 58 Beastlord</a><br>

<br>
I'm sorry. Where in Verant's rules does it say you need x amount of people with such-and-such a group configuration and you have x amount of time to kill a mob? I find it hilarious that some are trying to prove themselves reasonable when the grudge they hold for UP on a whole has been paraded with admirable flames on this thread from the getgo. But nah, that couldn't possibly impair judgment! Somehow I'm not supposed to link cause and effect. And finally, there are always &quot;special clauses&quot; people reserve for themselves to make allowances for being, in a word, dicks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't know it was arrogant to say you won't engage a mob you can't kill.&quot;<br>
<br>
Arrogance is not setting limits/standards for yourself. Arrogance is deciding your limits/standards are better than someone else's and therefore your standards should be enforced against their will.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eh... Whiners. Humm... I didn't see Radiant post first about &quot;oooo you trained our hate raid WAAAAHH&quot; No I saw UP post about &quot;WaaaaaH! You KS'd a mob our single ench with her lvl 40 pally friend couldn't kill!&quot; Yup.. Whine on you Crazy Diamond..&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know how long you've been with Radiant, but there have been one or two threads here. Long at that, one of them started by Trist.<br>
<br>
It was a sarcastic remark at Raehn's arrogant statements. If one group of people get to decide a chanter/paly is insufficient force to bring down Cazel and their guildmates won't show up before the two die by whatever mystical powers they are endowed with, I can get to decide whenever a group of people will not successfully kill Lodi after an allotted time set by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> me</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, so I shouldn’t have to get scathed here. After all, I’m prescient, right?<br>

<br>
When my ranger was 20 something and fighting in South Karana many moons ago, there was a bard that would run around and aggro every single gnoll around the paw spires and say he was 'kiting' them, in other words he was engaged with them and killing them.  He was, but so slowly that he made no tangible dent in even one gnoll's health after about 10 minutes of kiting.<br>
<br>
Guess what.  A guide or GM (Can't remember which because I didn't notice such things back then) showed up and /killed every single one of the gnolls he was 'kiting' because he could not possibly kill them and he was disrupting the zone.<br>
<br>
Additionally I have seen guides time and time again specifically state that sufficient force constitutes the right to a monster, not 'snare it and run it around for a while'.  See ragefire disputes in the past when a single druid would snare the human version and run him around while a guild mobilized.  That does not constitute engagement and never has, this is no different.  Sufficient force is not a matter of numbers, it is a matter of ability.  <br>
