class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> When this list was started (before it was called a list and before there was a board to keep track of it), it was not intended to say who could kill Ragefire and who couldn't.  It was an arrangement between a few clerics and their guilds to assist one another with camp that blows major chunks.  The sitting cleric would have chance to take a shower, get a few hours sleep, eat real food, walk her dog, see her kids, etc. and the cleric assisting her would receive information on spawn times and have opportunity to take camp next.  Both greatly increased their chances of being there when Ragefire spawned and being able to mobilize forces at any time of day to kill him.  Sure someone could still come in and take Ragefire away from them despite what they had done but it was less likely.<br>
<br>
And why did these people feel that such an agreement was necessary?  Because they had seen FFA in action.  Because they didn't want to do the same thing.  They preferred to work together even if it meant waiting a little while.  <br>
<br>
Granted, at that time, the &quot;list&quot; was a few names scribbled down on paper and wait was a month at the most.  Things have changed but I still think that it's up to the clerics to decide.  Personally I can see where having someone put twink who hasn't even started epic quest on it would be a problem.  The problems with the list should be addressed... by clerics.  <br>
<br>
Eventually someone will choose to ignore list and try to get Ragefire.  IMO they are free to do so but they should realize that they will be competing against the combined forces of several guilds whose clerics are on the list.  I hope someone doing this would lose race but if they manage to engage Ragefire first and get a clean kill then piece is theirs.  Frankly I picture chaos leading to GM involvement.  I won't swear revenge on cleric or guild as a result though. <p><a href="http://216.118.107.63/SIGS/juror.jpg" target="_blank">

-- Fem<br>
<br>
Come on. I don't have to be a cleric to know that camp sucks. I don't have to be a cleric to sympathize and wish Verant would give up the asinine idea that, since the class is pivotal in a lot of situations, they eventually pay for their high demand with a slap-in-the-face joke of an epic. I don't have to play a rogue to know the epic is one of the easiest, if not the easiest out there. (No offense to rogues who had a difficult time or shitty luck.)<br>
<br>
&quot;You dont know what it's like to finish up to rage and realize you won't be able to get it without a bunch of shit talking, guild fighting, GM, KSing, BS.&quot;<br>
-- Fem<br>
<br>
That is just it. The list is not a guarantee that no one will &quot;KS.&quot; Those who believe everyone will abide by it are deluding themselves.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clerics quit more than any other class, why? If you dont know without asking why 'prod?'&quot;<br>
-- Fem<br>
<br>
In my pseudo-newbie days I quit my &quot;twink&quot; because a heals-on-wheels toon is not my idea of fun. Do I have license to prod now?<br>
<br>
&quot;Why antagonize us even more than Verant has already?&quot;<br>
-- Fem<br>
<br>
Pala made his threat post on, what I think, was the assumption that disagreeing with the list implied a covert desire to go ganking Ragefires although no one made such a statement. If my reluctance to support the list and trying to get across that not everyone will agree to it/recognize it can be construed as antagonizing, feel free to say anything you like.<br>
<br>
&quot;...that's true but I think most friends and guilds would support their cleric as a person on any decision they make, not sure why you think that gives you a right to tell us we dont know wtf we are doing.&quot;<br>
-- Fem<br>
<br>
I don't CARE what a group of people decide on. I don't have a right to tell them how to go about the camp. I DO have a problem when those who support this system think THEY can push their procedure on OTHERS regardless of how those others feel. Clear?<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm confused. Is the line at the post office fair? At the grocery store? I mean when you got in your car you didn't know there would be a line, but when you get there.. there it is. Is that unfair? I mean the person who called ahead and saw there was a half price sale had or saw the add in the paper had an unfair advantage right?&quot;<br>
-- FK<br>
<br>
Barring nuclear holocaust there will always be a line at the post office. At the grocery store. There will always be bumper to bumper traffic. And there will always be a daily edition. The list is ridiculously long. I won't have to wait six months to buy stamps, groceries, reach the city, or buy the paper.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't get it Is it better for some guild to keep a team of burners ready at all times to be able to gank every single Rage spawn?&quot;<br>
-- FK<br>
<br>
Good God. How did burners come into this?<br>
<br>
&quot;It is now possible for large guilds to EASILY monopolize these spawns. With high AA toons they only have to send a few people to kill them. Minimal resources spent with minimum response time.&quot;<br>
-- FK<br>
<br>
::smiles:: FK, isn't this progression? How's it okay for one group of burners to kill Kunark dragons yielding epic components but not okay for a small group(s) to bring down Ragefire? And how do you get to decide how many are enough for an old fashioned raid and when six are enough? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 8/12/02 6:43:46 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uketelkaotic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ketel Kaotic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/12/02 6:48:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://ketelkaotic.com/dancer2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> lol love how mlain got rage but thats not his last part....<br>

Her analysis of what is wrong with the list is accurate and taken as a whole make for a situation that is even more open to abuse than FFA.  This is primarily true because politics are a big part of it.  It appears that some on the board have had the foresight to predict that this would happen (not a large leap of logic to be sure), and quite frankly they are correct in pointing out that it will get worse.  I would think that a discussion of the list problems at this time would be welcomed and Yinta should be saluted for bringing to your attention the inevitable future issues.  I would argue that the majority of the attacks on the people who have questioned the list do more than anything else to prove Yinta's points.  Some points I would make.....<br>
<br>
The threats I find amusing.  It would give me a great deal of pleasure to have someone banned for this type of behavior.<br>
<br>
I fail to see how only clerics can engage in logical discussion of this issue &lt;shrug&gt;.<br>
<br>
I find it very amusing that many of the guilds that have KSed either myself or others in my presence, or who have stated that it is their position that the sever is FFA, can even consider now supporting the list.<br>
<br>
The arguments that everyone should know about the list, which include any number of insults, implied or otherwise are ridiculous.  This argument assumes so many things it boggles the mind that it is being made.  It also is in line with the other arguments which tend to attack the questioner as opposed to addressing the facts.<br>
<br>
I have seen no evidence (although I am sure it is in another thread somewhere) to repudiate any of the following: that non main characters are on the list, that certain guilds seem to be overly represented on the list, that getting on the list is a political exercise, that no consideration is given for having completed other steps of the epic, that the list creation was controlled by a few individuals on the server, that the list is controlled by a few individuals on the server, that stacking of friends and guildmates on the list has been perpetrated by those that control it.  <br>

These are the issues that you will need to address and soon if I am any judge of human nature.  You will find that the people who have asked you to question the list, or better yet what it has become and was destined to become, will not be the ones who &quot;Gank&quot; the Dragon.  Rational polite people seldom engage in that type of conduct.  Yinta has merely pointed out what is obvious to many of us, but history is full of stories of people being publicly attacked for having both insight and the courage to say what is obvious.<br>

Go back and work on your reading comprehension.<br>

How crystal clear do I have to make it to you that I don't have a problem with people opposing 'the list'.  Everyone can have whatever opinion they want.  If the clerics decide to go FFA again then thats their decision.<br>
<br>
I was refering to any who might gank/ks/leapfrog kidare's ragefire camp.  And it was clear that I addressed my posts to those who might gank/ks/leapfrog.<br>

<br>
Obviously you didnt read the whole post on that thread.<br>
<br>
I DID propose a solution. And the solution was ........ *drum roll*....... <br>
<br>
SIT THERE AND CAMP IT.<br>
<br>
If every other spawn in the game is handled like that why not Ragefire. You sit your ass down there and you get in line behind the cleric who has been sitting there in front of you. You have to work / sleep ? Get someone to log your toon on and camp it. <br>
<br>
I seriously doubt ppl be willing to sit there for 15days. It'll start out at 7-8 days probably and those who can will get their epic earlier. Soon the sitting time will automatically reduce to 4-5 days as the hardcore  get theirs done. <br>
<br>
For example, I am ready to get Ragefire done. I go to Skyfire , I see 3 clerics sitting there. I understand I am in line behind those 3. I know 1 of them is a casual player and no way in hell can he last 10 days 24/7. Gives me 5-6 days of sitting time. Oh well, it's hell..... but I must want it bad enough. And there's always the chance another cleric in the line ahead of me might give up as well.<br>
<br>
Make sense ?<br>
<br>
This is a queue. It's how all other camps work. You want that EB earring ? You go to the camp. You see 2 ppl ahead of you. You sit there and wait your turn. You want that concert ticket. You go to the theater and see 3 ppl camping out in front of you, you get in line and wait your turn.<br>
<br>
What you guys are doing is, you go to a restaraunt and you ask for a table and they tell you it's reservation only and the wait is 6 months long. You cant protest because it's THEIR restaraunt. Well, they can do it. You cant. It's not your game, and you aren't the authority. And it's NOT fair.<br>

I am kinda curious to some parts of this as well.  If something like the list is ever going to work for the long run it would have to be non-biased and kinda equal-opportunity for all IMO.<br>

I haven't heard anyone talk about busting up an existing camp.<br>
<br>
The problem is.. the list... not who is there now, but why is the person 10 spots down more deserving than someone in SF ready to go after the current camp is over?<br>
<br>
If kildare *is* camping Ragefire anyone trying to jump is an ass.  This is completely irregardless of the list.  It's jumping an existing camp.  <br>
<br>
If Kildare gets Rage and then 2 (or 3 or 4 or 40) clerics are there hoping for the next rage... who decides who is next?  This is what the list is trying to solve but it's turning into bullying  and monopolizing at this point.  You *will* get ppl not willing to go on a 40-long and growing list.  You *will* get ppl that ride other folk's work to coast to their rage on the list, while someone else ready and able and willing to put in the work themselves gets insulted and &quot;blacklisted&quot;.  <br>
<br>
It was brought up to shorten the list to 2 or 3 clerics tops then random to fill the 'next' slot every time rage dies.   This is deemed &quot;unfair&quot; only by folks that get to make the long list.  This is not coincidental.  <br>
<br>
It always sucks when somebody monopolizes something, but it's always great to be a monopoly.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I support whatever my teammate-cleric wants in regards to the list and ffa on Rage.  We have 3 clerics on the list currently.  If a cleric wants to hard-camp the mob outside the list I support that also. I won't condone stealing an existing camp, but a cleric there when/before Rage dies has as much right to the next Rage as anyone.<br>
<br>
The list is an option, it's not an authority.  I like the idea behind it, I think it's an admirable effort, but it's getting topheavy and the bigger the list gets, and the less flexible and more antagonistic the list-users get to new clerics... the closer it gets to failing. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

<br>
My sentiments exactly.  Kidare *is* camping ragefire and has an existing camp that will be maintained until he gets his ragefire.  Right after Prizmo gets his, of course.<br>
<br>
That is why I might have seemed a bit *upset* when I made my first post because it would be jumping an existing camp.<br>

Nowhere in this thread have I advocated the dissolution of the list (dissolution has four syllables Lauriston - have Mommy look up that word for you).  However, I do feel that the Cleric epic is perhaps the most poorly designed quest in the game and is in dire need of tweaking or redesign.<br>

Yes - my wife got her epic.  More power to her.<br>
Yes - I got my Red Scale.  More power to me.<br>
And for the record, No - Tristadorn didn't throw me out of Radiant.  I walked out.  Why?  Because it was turning into a guild of insufferable pricks.  And you seem to fit right in.  So why don't you go &quot;r0x0r Tristadorn's c0x0r&quot; some more.<br>

Hasn't it been made clear enough that nobody on either side of this condones that kind of behavior? That if you want a shot you sit down and camp it, respect those already present? How does &quot;busting up&quot; the list equate with KSing? It's assuming the worst in people.<br>

The only system Verant supports and ondones on Ragefire is first come first serve (FFA). Contrary to whatever other speculation there might be. Gms will act as mediators if more than one raid is present and ready to do the spawn. Thats pretty much the end of it.<br>
<br>
 Palz. I laughed at your threats because I dont see DB getting keyed up in SSRA anytime soon. Whatever that 'clap tov' nonsense meant thats where most of the top guilds are now, so its kind of laughable to threaten them. There are plenty of high level guilds outside vis lc and waif as well. Rel in Por is just one of those for example, there are others. The fact is like Gurunt said - it is the job of the list makers to convince people to support the list not to make demands and threats (paraphrase). Once that happened any marginal moral superiority they might have had claim to went out the window.<br>
