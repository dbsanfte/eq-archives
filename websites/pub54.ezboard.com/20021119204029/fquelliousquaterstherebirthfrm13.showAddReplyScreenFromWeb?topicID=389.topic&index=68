I had the pleasure of meeting Danera once, thought she was a very straight forward and kind person. Guess my opinion of claver is on the negative side now. <br>
<br>
Zupe, all those eyes wraith sent up were pretty funny heh. <br>
Btw eyes don't agro, and if door was open there is still no agro, unless someone actually walks through them to the other side, one of your members could have easily done that. And if the train consisted of regular easy second floor mobs, there is a problem in ssra that snakes train through the doors on their own. The other night while we were killing AL, there were about 6-7 snakes that charged through the AL door. LC was in the zone atm so were several wraith/revi members, but we didn't go off accusing people of training us. <br>
<br>
Ketel, I don't seem to recall any vis members posting on here that omg some wraith people left their guild and joined another or formed their old guilds... Thanks, but no need to bring vis into unrelated flames.<br>

In my post did I mention anything about mugen or what he did? I don't think so. I don't know about his involvement, therefore I did not comment on his behalf. <br>
And if I remember correctly, I always encouraged 5e back then to become a raid force such as vis,wraith and lc are now, and of course there were smack talk because there were conflicts with the other guilds. Who was it that deserted the guild 2 whole days after he was made officer and pledged to help guide and lead 5e? Was it the noble ketel? lolz<br>
I was at that creator raid, and spoke with my friends from wraith and my guildies. I cant speak now because I'm new to my guild even if I was at the raid? Am I blind? <br>
No doubt I have nothing to say about Vis in the past, but this incident happened only 3 days ago. <br>

That was me, and I spoke with thelon about the fact I wanted my wraith tag back.   I was not happy in Fifth eclipse you have 5-6 &quot;leaders&quot; 5-10 &quot;offciers&quot; .  It was not a place for me, and I had been talking to droz about restarting wraith, and said I would come back.  I was straight forward with the &quot;leadership of 5e, and stated many times that if wraithw as rebuilt I would be leaving for it.    Did the &quot;leadership&quot; ever say after building a guild they would abondon it for vis?   I never remember hearing that in /gu<br>

<br>
1.  Mugen came from vis's camp, into our camp.<br>
<br>
2.  Mugen started casting spells, i have spell effects off during big fights, so im not sure what he was casting..but he WAS casting spells, he even admits that.<br>
<br>
3.  At the same time Mugen appears and starts casting spells, Creator aggro starts going crazy, we cant keep him on our MT, regardless of aggro increase spells or EB procing weapons.  Rampages start going everywhere, even though we had it set up for a rampage tank, and that rampage tank had been taking rampages flawlessly before mugen arrives.<br>
<br>
Now my questions is, even if Mugen didn't cast memblur to screw with our fight.  Why would he be in our camp at all, and on top of that why would he be casting spells in our camp during our fight.  It does nothing more but to set yourself and your guild up for accusations like, &quot;mugen memblurred our mob&quot;.<br>
<br>
We have no other explanation why aggro kept getting thrown off, and our rampage tank going from taking all ramps, to not taking any at all.  That stuff usually doesn't happen, especially the rampage part.  If anyone knows rampages, they just dont change rampage targets unless the person dies, gets out of rampage range, or the mob gets memblurred.  Leegan didnt die, didnt move from rampage range...so what else is left....<br>
<br>
I agree that it is over with, and regardless of what happend..we all act childish at times and do stupid things.  Im just giving you guys some insight on why Wraith is so quick to make accusations about Mugen memblurring the Creator<br>

Holyheal, when you were in wraith befiore 5e and before vis, do you remember Rev was our guild partner?   When wraith was reformed we were pretty damn weak, but wanted to raid Rev people wanted to raid too.   Hence the start of a great relationship of helping each other to becoem better.    We are two independant guilds that work Together for a common cause.<br>
<br>
I hope that answered some of your questions.<br>
<br>
I have friends in VIS, and friends in Lotus cult.  As a matter of fact one of my best friends in EQ is in Lotus Cult.    I have nothing agaist individuals that play the game fairly and with respect for others.   I do have problems with morons that think they are better than others, and choose to act that way.   Usually these type of people are idiots in real life, but are too gimp to act that way in real life, so they take out thier aggresions on people that cant punch them in the face.<br>
<br>
I have no problem personally with driften, thelon, HH, flyingpig, elyda, and many others in Vis, but the mob mentality takes over sometimes.  When someone in wraith does something wrong I get pissed, and dont defend them just becasue they are WRAITH.  I treat people as individuals.  <br>
<br>
When a a player dies, and I see the body, or needs a port  I dont judge them on being VIS or Lotus cult.   I judge them on thier personal actions.<br>

It also seems to happen when people just seem to sit along the wall.  It has nothing to do with who else is in the zone or what they're doing, it's just a really screwed up z axis bug. =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugannalyseroguechick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gannalyse Roguechick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/11/02 3:23:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get your stories straight~</span><hr size=1> <br>

<br>
why talk to someone like that? all he does is trolling, not a single word from all his posts is trying to solve the conflict between both guild, even though desi/gurunt/etc and lots of VM posted it was a misunderstanding.  <br>
<br>
anyway..just ignore that troll.  he can hate VM as much as he wants, but he has no right to make our relationship worst than it looks just because he doesnt like us.  i dont even know why wraith want someone like that in guild, he doesnt even care about your own members, and he sure doesnt care that he make 'wraith' a bad name that everyone hate...and i have no doubt his anon troll posts back in the day is the main reason we have such a bad relationship now.  <br>
<br>
ok..i feel much better now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwarlordette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warlordette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/11/02 4:24:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=389.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Get your stories straight~</span><hr size=1> now why ya gotta go doo that woow<br>
