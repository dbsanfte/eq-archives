<br>
You can all believe what I am about to say or not, makes no difference to me.<br>
<br>
I have known Kuud for awhile, although I can not say that we are friends. A friend does not offer something to you and then change the deal mid-stream.<br>
<br>
These are the facts from my dealings with Kuud.<br>
<br>
He has always been nice to me, when he thinks I can help him with something or can get him help with something.<br>
<br>
He did offer me a Heiro cloak for my monk while asking me to help him get his Tear. After he got the tear, he seemed to forget about the cloak. I said nothing to him about this, although i did let my guild know.<br>
<br>
I then attempted to help him do Kirn as long as he had some friends to help do this, as I was not going to ask my guild to take their time to do it, while I was supposed to receive a cloak, didnt seem fair to them.<br>
<br>
I showed up for Kirn and we made it to the city before we got wiped out. Most of the people that were there were either running off and getting killed causing us to have to go back for them, going LD or bitching that it was taking too long(yet they had never been on a Kirn run before) and trying to rush things and getting ahead of themselves. You do not rush through the City in The Hole with 2 groups of low 50's, you have to clear it properly or you will die, period.<br>
<br>
After we were wiped out, Kuud did log a mule and drag corpses to the ledge, then he logged, I ended up doing the rest of the CR for his raid while he logged to watch Barney and eat popcorn, I guess.<br>
<br>
I asked him about the Hiero cloak before the raid and he said he wanted to wait until we killed Kirn. I told him I would get the force needed, but would like the cloak and even offered to do Kirn right next time as well as 5K PP. Didn't get a response from him.<br>
<br>
I wrote it off as a scam and some time later I received a tell from Kuud that he had a Necklace of Superiority and was going to give it to me to help him with Kirn, not 5 minutes later i saw him auctioning it. Yet, I still did not say anything derogatory to him, guess that's just me.<br>
<br>
Some time passes and I receive a tell that he has Torpor and will give it to Gray Soldiers in return for help with his epic. I tell him we would help him with it and he says he will hold it for us, but during the same time he was offering it to others for help.<br>
<br>
Prior to all this happening Kuud and I were in SF duoing and I asked him if he had Greater Bear Form, he said no. I gave him the copy I had on me. A couple minutes later he said he had to go do something and would be right back, he never came back. Later that night I saw him auctioning the spell he said he did not have.<br>
<br>
Just not too long ago I saw him auctioning another copy of Greater Bear Form and I had a Shaman friend that needed it, I sent him a tell asking him if i could have it as I had a friend in need, I got no response. <br>
<br>
So the questions are:<br>
<br>
Has Kuud been scamming people? I believe so.<br>
<br>
Is Kuud a liar? most definitely.<br>
<br>
Is Kuud greedy? A resounding Yes.<br>
<br>
If Kuud considered me a friend, I dont think the above things would have taken place, but the whole time, I said nothing, guess thats just me not wanting to believe he would accept my offer to assist him when needed, give him something he said he did not have, yet, not trust me to honor my word to help him with his epic had he honored his original offer that he himself made me.<br>
<br>
You see Kuud, if you are truly friends with someone, you don't wave a carrot in front of their face and then jerk it away at the last moment and expect them to be your friend.<br>
<br>
Had you honored your agreement with the cloak, as I did with the Tear, not only would you have your epic still, but you would have had a whole guild of friends in Gray Soldiers which would have gladly welcomed you along on future raids and assistance should you ever needed it.<br>
<br>
I do not hate Kuud, as I hate noone, especially over a game, however, I do not trust him or his word anymore than I would trust a crack addict in a pharmacy.<br>
<br>
I personally hated to make this post, but I felt it needed to be addressed as I feel Kuud has insulted my intelligence on more than one occasion by refering to me as a friend, when his actions have proven otherwise.<br>
