&quot; All we Europeans can do can sit, x our fingers and hope the 'gung-ho' Bush jnr dosent go and do something dumb.&quot; <br>
<br>
 Try having a few airplanes fly into your skyscrapers and murder several thousand of your fellow men women, and children. Then try and say how we shouldn't take the fight to these people. Try having that many people's lives destroyed because some religous zealots can't tolerate other views. <br>
<br>
 Iraq has shown agression in the past, and wil again in the future. Why do you think Iraq has kicked the weapon inspectors out over and over again? <br>
<br>
 People think Bush isn't smart or doesn't know what he is doing beacause your told to believe that. The guy fumbles a few words and hes declared an idiot. Well, like the rest of you oafs I hope our enemies underestimate him as well. <br>
<br>
 Bush as brought back some dignity and respect to the office of the President. After 8 years of the money grabbing, affair having clown that was Clinton, I couldn't be more pleased with Bush.<br>
<br>
 Europeans should think back about 50 years and remember what sitting on their hands got them. It got them their asses handed to them by a lunatic, and guess who came to bail them out? <br>

This has to be one of the most foolish thing I have read.  I am an American.  To bash the Europeans for being cowards is Lunacy.<br>
<br>
Lets look at these cowards:<br>
<br>
France, Britain and Germany left a Generation dead in the fields of Belgium and France between 1914 and 1918.  Trench warfare -- charging en masse into Machinegun fire.  The British at Passchendale -- cowards --look at the casualties.  They lost more that day than we lost in all of WWI.<br>
<br>
The next Generation of Germans, French and British?  Wiped out at Stalingrad, North Africa, Italy, Burma, India.     <br>
<br>
Those cowardly British sailed halfway around the world and fought, vastly out numbered without landbased aircraft, a modern well equipped nation over some islands that only sheep could love.  They won.<br>
<br>
The cowardly Europeans were the only peacekeepers trying to prevent war in Bosnia when the US refused to help.<br>
<br>
I think the Europeans have a reason to be wary of war.  <br>
<br>
You may disagree with them, but we, as a nation have not earned the right to call them cowards.<br>
<br>
Shame on you.<br>

<br>
One of the major world war II battles was the battle of Britain where British Aircraft (Spitfires) were outnumbered 4-1 with the Lutwaffe.  The Germans were also in the process of developing the V1 Rockets which were used towards the end of the siege and Spitfires had to shoot these down.  <br>
<br>
Germany (quite wrongly) turned their own attacks from the airfields of UK to London after we bombed Berlin in retaliation with 4 of our own bombers.  <br>
<br>
We held them off and then began the siege of Normandy where allied troops invaded in the biggest clusterf**k of an operation ever.<br>
<br>
Another major Nazi mistake was not to wake Hitler when the attacks began .. he apparently had a huge amount of Panza / Tiger tank units in position 10 miles from Normandy waiting for the invasion to happen upon his orders.  <br>
<br>
If in the event, England (the last outpost of Europe) hadn't held out in the Battle of Britain - the U.S. today would more than likely be under Nazi influence.  <br>
<br>
And one of the main reasons why the U.S. 'bailed' us out was because of their own interests.  Japan were allied with Germany and obviously the attack on Pearl Harbour had caused a huge dent to American confidence.  <br>
<br>
Japan were being supplied technology by the massively superior germans.  Dosen't take a brain surgeon to work out in those days (or nowadays) you cut off supplies someone is gonna struggle.<br>
<br>
By saying that England for one have not been victim of Terrorism, all you got to do is look at the bombings that the IRA have inflicted to us over the last XXX amount of years and the terrorist attack on the Iranian Embassy in the UK in the 1980s.<br>
<br>
Yes, you want retribution for it of course you do.  <br>
<br>
When I heard of the September 11th incident, I was disgusted.   I was immediately wary about what was gonna happen next and I totally supported Tony Blair's declaration to stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with the Americans.  <br>
<br>
But in terms of a politician I do not think George Bush is very good.  He may be an excellent militant leader (very much like Margaret Thatcher / Winston Churchill was) but I think that Bill Clinton was a much better diplomat.  <br>
<br>
So what, he had his plums sucked on my a horse faced cow.  Happens all the time.<br>

Many men with higher placed families did nowhere near so well. Many sons of former presidents have been a joke in fact, vis a vis Ron Reagan Jr. <br>
<br>
B) Reagan was bad? In whose book? Don't make me smack you. Reagan was one of the greatest presidents we've had in this country. The fall of the Soviet Union was largely the doing of his administration, IMO. Much of America's success in the 90's is a direct result of events the Reagan administration set in motion in the 80's.<br>
<br>
C) Saddam Hussein is a beast, a monster, but he is also a balancing point in that region. As essentially a secular govt, he is a huge aggravation for the worst fundamentalist. The fact that he provides money to them is likely more a matter of fear as well as political usefulness.  Does he need to be removed? Yes, he does. His course is a dangerous one and will lead ot ruin for more than just his nation. Should we go to war against him? I don't really think so. I don't think the case has been made.<br>
<br>
The problem I have with much of this thread is the rampant Bush-bashing. There is a lot going on here and Bush is not being as blatantly stupid as you might think he is. While we hear sabre-rattling and threats, have we seen mass recruitment or build-up in ground forces? Have we seen treaties negotiated with local powers to provide ground bases? Have we seen attempts at coalition building? No. All we have seen are threats.<br>
<br>
Why is this? One answer is that such threats destabilise Iraq inherently. The threat of another pounding by the West is going to cause unrest in the country. There are local elements in place that deeply hate Hussein. What might it take for those elements to activate and take him out themselves? It is against the odds, of course, but what does it cost? A few articles on a possible threat from us? That's expensive =P<br>
<br>
The other thing you aren't looking at is that it might just be working. Driving in to work today, CBS News Radio had a report that Hussein was backing down off his refusal to allow UN Weapons inspectors into Iraq. While he's trying to maneuver politically with this, it is still backing down from his hard-line point. <br>
<br>
I see this administration's threat as having accomplished a small win today. If Hussein backs down and allows the UHN Inspectors back into Iraq, he loses face. His nerve will have broken first. I call that a good thing.<br>
<br>
The other thing I think many people aren't looking at is the fact that the administration admitted that they were planning on putting out disinformation. The whole sabre-rattling thing has all the hallmarks of a ploy to me. I doubt we will go through with it, unless someone stupid takes it too seriously. So far, it has been all talk, smoke and mirrors, and I think the sheep are believing it. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

My God, I'm still flabbergasted by the utterly moronic chest-pounding that is perpetrated by the small-brained portion of my own countrymen when the subject of Europe in the two World Wars comes up.<br>
<br>
We cannot even concieve of what the UK, France, Belgium, etc went through in WWI and WWII as we, as a nation, have never seen a modern occupation or war on our own home turf. Have you no idea the devastation that occurred in Europe as a result of these wars? And these people still kept on fighting.<br>
<br>
I have much love for Britain and its' people and hold them up as a persistant example of valour to this day. If there is a Navy more professional and competent than the British Fleet, I've not seen it. If there are troops better trained and more motivated than Royal Marines, SBS, SAS, Gurkha Rifles, etc, I've not heard of them. England is a small country and has and does accomplish mighty things. <br>
<br>
Don't belittle their courage when you obviously know little about it.<br>
<br>
Now, to you Brits out there bashing Bush (Raluvin=P), each nation has different needs and requirements. You've had your own governemental scandals and cleaned house afterwards. Was the result pretty? Not usually. Bush may not be the best president we've seen, but he is the result of too much dishonesty in the previous administration.Before you bash him because you fear that he _might_ do something stupid, look at his track record. I see no incredible blunders so far.<br>

I do not think history will be kind to Reagan.  We had really little to do with winning the cold war as much  the internal contradictions of the Soviet System had in losing it.<br>
<br>

Reagan won the Cold War by his willingness to throw large sums of money at Star Wars, and the Russians couldn't keep up and went broke.  Ask Margret Thatcher.<br>

We also have Reagan to thank for the prosperity of the 90's and Clinton to thank for the recession of the 2000's.<br>

<br>
A War will not necessarily gaurentee an economic rebound. In fact, Bush Sr.'s attempt at a legacy, Desert Storm, did not help him to a re-election. The economy faultered and stagnated, shortly after the success in the middle east. The trickle down economy effects did not occur, and they won't occur this time either. In fact, Bush Sr. went from an approval rating in the 90% range to not even getting elected. Bush #2 does not have the guidence of an unbiased group of people when it comes to dealing with the middle east, Colin Powel, who hit the lime light during the middle east conflict,  and many others are all his aids now, this is not good. Short of Margret Thatcher showing up and taking Bush #2 on a 3 day trip to a bunker in Colorado, we are seeing nearly the same thing we saw from Bush #1. Bush #2 is a sad excuss for a president. Perhaps Bush should try getting Bin Laden first then move on to bigger fish. There is no reason to mobilize an army against Sadam Hussien, he is clearly using this and Sept. 11th as a soap box to help boost the republicans in the next election and to help with his re-election bid, it won't work.  Congress needs to stop letting Bush #2 spend $500 million every few months to put him in the lime light. His spending is out of control, and the projects they are spent on are absolutly a waste. The people in Florida will count the votes right this time.<br>
<br>
As for the person, and any other person who makes a comment saying that we in the U.S. have suffered greatly at the hands of terrorists from the attacks of Sept. 11th, you are dead wrong. The people that reside in the middle east suffer through acts of terrorism and re-talitory actions EVERY DAY. More people have been injured and killed in that area than you can possible fathom. Yes the attacks on the towers were grusome and terrible, but imagine if it was that way every day for you. Our pain and suffering is miniscule compared to those elsewhere.<br>

You can thank Reagan for the dick in the ass you get from the banking industry. Reagan was nothing but a puppet for Nancy and still is. <br>
<br>
If you strongly believe that &quot;trickle down economics&quot; exists, you need to get out of the 80's. There is no proof that the idea lambasted by the (R) in the 80's has emerged. <br>
<br>
The economic recession is not really a recession, we are still growing just at a slower rate. Alan Greenspan was right back in the late 90's we were experiencing growth at a rate which the economy could not sustain. Anything over 2.5% growth is looked at as a warning sign of inflation. This is proven by the recent string of firms doctoring their books to make it look like their growth is still on par. No one except DOTcom companies and tech stocks has anything serious to worry about. The business cycle is exactly that, a cycle. We will be heading back to the peak again soon, and guess what? We will go back down after that, but I gaurentee that the economy will never &quot;devalue&quot; it will just grow at a slower rate. How can you blame Clinton for anything, I thought he was the do nothing President?<br>

BTW Mohogani, he didn't win the electoral college per se, he was appointed president by the supreme court who awarded him the state of Florida, thereby giving him a victory in the electoral college, but thats soooo two years ago.  Oh, and Reagen won the cold war by ballooning military spending by siphoning all money away from important domestic programs resulting in a massive debt.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if half of the bush administration would put down their bibles and pick up a history book they might actually learn something useful.  War NEVER stops killing, it only redirects who's being killed.  <br>
<br>
The Iraqies dont attack the US cause they are just genetically preprogramed to hate all americans, as some news agencies might seem have you think.  They are pissed off because the U.S. has been extremely exploitive and manipulative in their dealings with Mideast countries.  We demand that they let us get their oil, but at the same time have the nerve to demand that they comply to our ways.  If your friend loses his job and you let him come live YOUR house, then he starts complaining about how your bed isn't made, orders you to prepare him a special vegetarian meal for dinner, then whines cause you didn't put enough lettuce on the salad, and then refuses to leave when you ask, you're not gonna be to happy either.  Jebus, he's in YOUR house ordering YOU around!  Thats the situation in the middle east and Sadaam is the only one that said &quot;No, I'm not going to tolerate this, get out&quot;.  We're so friggin addicted to their oil nipple we just cant let go yet we continue to try and order these countries around like THEY are the ones in OUR territory.  Thats no kind of negotiating position!  As long as we're stuck on the oil, there's no way there will ever be peace between the middle east and the U.S..  Taking out Sadaam aint gonna fix a damn thing.  Until we ween ourselves off that dope, we're going to be dependant on mideast oil, and thus, unable to negotiate in a reasonable manner.  <br>
<br>
We claim that Sadaam is some kind of living satan, and that no other people in the world suffer as much as those in Iraq.  The government tries to pass this off as a humanitarian mission and that we are freeing the oppressed people of Iraq and that once Sadaam is dead, the Iraqi women will be free to rip off their veils, and dance gidily around in the streets, a la Juilie Andrews in the sound of music, while the men and the children clap their hands to the beat of the uptemo sitar music and the world will be free of oppression and tyrany forever!  Sorry, not gonna happen.  The fact of the matter is this, there are places in the world where conditions are immesureably more deplorable than in Iraq.  For instance, lets take Uganda.  There you have a military general declaring genocide upon another tribe.  Millions slaughtered, but nobody in the U.S. gives a shit.  Why?  Because they dont have any oil do they.  They have nothing we need.  The Iraq mission isn't about being humanitarian, its about oil.<br>
<br>
Oh but we're in luck, thanks to the supreme court we've got an oil man in the white house, actually, LOTS of oil men!  Surely they'll want to help us become less dependant on foreign oil.  I really love their plan to spend 10 years and 40 bagillion million dollars building an oil pipeline up in the Alaskan wilderness to get a 6 month supply of oil so that we'll be free of foreign oil between January and July of 2012!  Thats just the kind of inginuity and forward thinking thing we need.<br>
<br>
No I'm not a Sadaam lover so dont start flaming me like I'm some kind of traitor.  Clearly the way he choses to go about fighting back at the U.S. is nowhere near the top of the &quot;good things to do&quot; list.  I am simply pointing out the often overlooked issues that are present in this situation.  Remember, when you're pointing the finger at someone, you've got 3 pointing back at you.  We as a country seem to forget that a lot.<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Anyway, the first thing that needs to be done is a huge increase towards the development of alternative fuel sources.  We can't negotiate effectively as long as we're dependant on oil from the region.  Then...maybe if we redirected some of this inflated military spending towards domestic and international aid programs, diplomatic relations initiatives, and public schools, we might one day raise a generation capable of dealing with conflict through less barbaric means.  One can only hope.<br>

No Bubba, I was talking about the post you were responding to. I think I was so flabbergasted that I forgot to name the perp. Sorry.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not think history will be kind to Reagan. We had really little to do with winning the cold war as much the internal contradictions of the Soviet System had in losing it.&quot;<br>
<br>
*Shrug* It's all a matter of opinion. We've had 20 years since Reagan first started swinging and polls still show him as being considered one of the greatest presidents of all time. Then again, Reagan was a rebound president much like Bush II. The country was rebounding from the absolute dearth of leadership in the Carter admin.<br>
<br>
Internal contradictions may have been a problem, but without pressure from the outside, flawed systems can continue to exist for quite some time. The Reagan admin destroyed the Soviet Machine by out-producing it. The out-production bankrupted the Sovs and allowed internal dissent to flower. Without the resources drawn away from internal policing, the Sovs would likely still have the same system as previously.<br>
<br>
&quot;Reagan's biggest accomplishment was in changing a merely huge deficit to an unbelievably enormous one.&quot;<br>
<br>
Feh. At the time, it was what was needed. Do you think we would have had the prosperity of the late 80's through 2000 were it not for what Reagan started? <br>
<br>
As to people still bitching about this non-existant war, does anyone have any backing to show that it is anything more than talk, or is everyone bleating like worried sheep and believing the empty sabre-rattling? <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

We have the liberals ranting again that Bush did not win the election. We have the peaceniks decrying Bush for a war that doesn't exist. We have oddballs analyzing why the American psychology somehow makes it a global aggressor. Then we have one of the all-time stupidities, &quot;Violence breeds violence&quot;.<br>
<br>
It's getting deep in here.<br>
<br>
A) Can we maybe agree that whether or not you believe that Bush won legitimately or not, that it has NOTHING to do with ANY discussion here? It's a null issue, people. Bitch all you want about the Supreme Court, but the decision is made.<br>
<br>
B) The war does not exist. It has not happened. It is not even particularly getting prepared for. I live in what is very likely the largest concentration of American Military forces on the East Coast (Hampton Roads area in Virginia), and it is dead obvious around here when a build-up is occurring. You get a massive influx of troops and gear, neither of which we are seeing. I simply do not believe this proposed war on Iraq is anything real at this point. It is a threat, nothing more.<br>
<br>
C) Our psychology is violent? Scuse me? Since when does this matter, and what culture isn't psychologically violent? I happen to have history books, modern ones, what show your peaceful Europeans as being FAR more aggressive than we in the last century alone. As a superpower, we've been positively angelic. So we like guns, muscles, and such. Whee! We're so frikken evil. For every example of American aggression globally, I can point out nigh-unbelievable numbers of aggressions by other so-called peaceful nations throughout the history of the world. Everyone is aggressive when their interests are threatened. Noone is clean of that &quot;stain&quot;. <br>
<br>
D) Violence breeds violence. Yup, and Peaceniks breed victims. And? <br>
