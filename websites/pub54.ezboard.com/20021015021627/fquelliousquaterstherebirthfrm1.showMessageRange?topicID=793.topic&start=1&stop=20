Well, in my short experience, I have run across more role models than jerks.  So, here's my thanks to those Quellious chars that have really stood out with a random act of kindness.<br><br><br>Pharmian...  If it weren't for this kind ranger, I would not be playing EQ today.  After mistakenly binding in stonebrunt at level 14, I realized the mobs were too difficult for me.  Yet I did not know my way back through the Warrens.  I was about ready to call it quits when Pharmian responded to ooc's and helped guide me back to Paineel.<br><br><br>Zelxvian...  Up on orc hill, this mysterious wolf made my entire newbie group into wolves just like him.  I thought that was the coolest thing EVER.  As time went on, I continued to notice how much help he would give to people.  According to the namechange list, he now goes by Cypruss.<br><br><br>Bostica...  Druid that randomly buffed my newbie gnome enchanter in Steamfont.  Kept me alive while she was hunting for iron oxide.  And after I was high enough to enchant clay, she offered to give me an opal encrusted stein in exchange for enchanting clay.  That's the way to make a newbie's day!  I think I randomly run into Bostica more than any other quellious char that's not on my friends list.  And it seems her entire EQ life is now spent helping others.<br><br><br>Dpowrz...  Young wizard that randomly offered to show me the ropes of the game.  Kept checking back on me over the course of several days.  I did a /who all on him the other day, and he's now level 52 and still plugging along.<br><br><br>Allanna...  When my cleric was a midbie, I met this sorceress (as one of her alts) when she joined our pickup group in MM.  After the battle, she brought me to a bank and gave me all her excess wis gear.  To this day, I still wear most of the gear - the gear was *that* good =)  Thanks for that random act of kindness!<br><br><br>Sizuko...  One of the reasons I became a cleric.  While fighting in the oasis, she came and killed a couple of SG's harrassing our group.  After some rez's, she gave our entire group the power of aegolism.  Our group was utterly unstoppable.  The puller was ordered to bring 20+ orcs, of which we summarily dispatched.  I still have a screenshot of the aego cast with all those 'sprinklies' around each of our group's members.  You may take those pretty colors for granted in the end game, but to a newbie, it really adds to the enrichment.<br><br><br>Mordridd...  Okay, so this necro is my cousin.  But he introduced me to EQ, and had the patience to show me everthing.  I emphasize the word patience.<br><br><br>Alleusion...  This 60 enchanter seems to love buffing newbies.  On several occasions, she would spring up and buff my group.  This spanned several zones, over the course of several weeks.  A level 60 enchanter can REALLY make a lowbie's day =)<br><br><br>Mortivore...  60 necro that summoned my corpse recently from a Naggy raid gone bad.  Asked for no compensation for the coffin!  Cut at least an hour off that nasty CR.  And as if that wasn't enough, he gave me a Robe of Living Fungus.  Now my cleric looks like a wizard and I LOVE IT!  Seriously, there may be better bp's out there, but I think I will keep this just because I love the look.  Thanks for yet another random act of kindness.<br><br><br>There were several others, but unfortunately, I did not write down their names.  I wanted to say thanks to all of you for making my EQ experience positive and fun.<br><br>Jerem, 49 high elf cleric <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucallandre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Callandre </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/26/02 10:19:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=793.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Server Heroes</span><hr size=1> What a wonderful thread to accentuate the positive!  *happy smile*<br><br>I'll add a couple here...<br><br>Carlii:  who gave me tons of buffs and a bracer when I was a brand new level one that I wore well into my 20s and popped up several times to buff a young &amp; struggling cleric as she was passing thru<br><br>Sharteen:  without whom I probably would have given up on EQ in frustration in the first 8 levels as a DE SK (my first character) who took me under his wing and provided knowledge, encouragement and cast off gear to a brand new player.

From giving out free buffs in East Commons to newbies {aa rr like me at the time} to coming all the way from Katt on the moon to some where in Kunark to rez me to get my level back, she has always been there for me.  To say she defines a in game hero is a understatement of epic proportions.<br><br>Juror is no slouch either.  I remember a time when me and a group of friends decided to hit the Tower of Frozen Shadow in Vel.  We were slightly in over our head.  We could win one out of maybe 3 fights.  One of the pulls went very bad and our cleric died.  Healers United was raiding there that day so I asked Dahlea to rez her so she could rez the the rest of our dead and go at it again.  Well she and Juror came down.  She rezed everyone and had to go back to the raid, but Juror stayed.  For like the next 2 hours, + - a little, he stayed there buffing and healing us.  That was nice.  We went from barely getting by to owning something like the first 3 floors.<br><br>This policy of going out of their way to help others does not just stop with their leaders.  It radiates throughout their entire guild.  A nicer bunch you will not find On Quellious or Norrath for that matter and they do deserve the titile of Quellious Heroes.  Not only do they do the Big things right, they do the little things right and doing the little things right consistantly is the hardest thing to do of them all.<br><br>Healers United thanks for all of your help over the almost 3 years I have been here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><html><body text="#CCCCCC" bgcolor="#000000" link="#0000EE" vlink="#551A8B" alink="#FF0000"><center>The mission is not the issue.

His friendship seemed never to ebb, and his patience never seemed to strain.<br><br><br>  Fendien - you are the person who has kept me playing, knowing that there are people that play on this server like you.  I have the highest regards for you, and look upon you as a role model.<br><br>And you, Tristadorn, you made me what I am today.  You kept my strive to become 60 alive and drove me to be the best I could be, not only for myself, but for the betterment of the guild, my friends, and the family I have come to know as Radiant.  I dont think there is anything I can really say to convay my thanks and gratitude about this, but I sure as hell try.<br><br>  Thanks guys, you're what makes this server worth playing on
