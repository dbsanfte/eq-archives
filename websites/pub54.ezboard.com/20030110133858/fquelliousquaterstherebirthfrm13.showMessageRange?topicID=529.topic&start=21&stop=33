Then I finally cancelled that account and I named a alt on my account with his main's name should he ever wish to return. I did not purchase the account my RL friend quit EQ (he is married) because it conflicted with his RL responsibilities. As you know many people quit and do come back. I decided after the 3 months that closing the account (as I don't have time or money to play two accounts) and naming a alt on my account with his main's name to be the best course of action. I did not try to sell or give that account away it is sitting dormant having been closed. Should my friend chose to reopen his account I can restore his name to him by deleting the name holding alt I made.<br>

I did something similar with a friend quitting for awhile taking his first name on a twink but if your account is still active then that person still can't get thier name back. kinda lame but its true. <br>
<br>
on the subject of Barto...<br>
<br>
I never hated the guy, but he was always wanting loot wether he could use or not. other then that i had no problems with him. i thought he played a decent bard, but was just a bit slow. but we all know alot of people are slow, every guild has their n00bie guildies. but really i only felt he was a bit too greedy. but i think he ment well.<br>

I remember grouping with Barto in OT with one of my characters. He was always shouting for people to join him over by the sarnak tower. I discovered that there was a reason why he had to keep asking for group members. Going afk without notice for minutes on end and leaving a rogue to tank mobs got old fast. So, the rest of us decided to disband and regroup in another location. Then I remember getting tells from Barto asking if my new group had a spot for a bard. After repeated requests, in a rare moment of utter, brutally direct honesty, I did explain why we didn't group with him. No profanity, no personal attacks of any sort beyond explaining exactly why *I* felt his play style was deficient and why I wasn't interested in grouping with him. And I believe I even asked in advance if he really wanted to know. His response was really hostile... which is sort of understandable -- but it wasn't me sending the inquiring tells it was him. So far so good.<br>
<br>
Guess he didn't really want to know my opinion after all. 10 minutes later we had a train of sarnaks blow into us (in the middle of the zone) with Barto leading the parade. We put up a pretty good fight but went down. He sends me some threatening tell which was just disturbing considering the lack of any discernable motivation for the behaviour -- beyond me criticizing him in tells. <br>
<br>
The upside was that the rogue from our old Barto group had a high level cleric and we all were happily rezzed. It remains one of the most unsettling experiences of my EQ experience. I don't know the person on the other side of the avatar so I don't even pretend (nor want) to understand the motivation. I just remember the creepy tone of the tell conversation. It's easily one of my top 5 bad experiences in EQ. (Ya, I lead a sheltered life mostly.) <br>

I should have banned you earlier.  Silly me, I thought I would actually give you a place to speak if you wanted to since you had once been in guild (under an assumed name mind you and after deceiving one of our officers.)  I was more than patient with you but even I have my limits.<br>
<br>
Actually I have grouped with you before.  As a bard, you did OK.  It did seem at times that you were either AFK or not paying attention but you kept song going.  I got you a rez when you got lost once too... remember that?  I do.  It was incredibly frustrating because I had cleric in zone and you weren't responding to tells.  She stayed to help you as personal favor to me. <p><a href="http://216.118.107.63/SIGS/juror.jpg" target="_blank">

Don't get me wrong, bards are tough to play, a bard was my original main character on Bertox.  Still, it's not exactly rocket science... true you have to mash a few more keys than most players to make a meaningful contribution to a group, but it's very doable, regardless of attention deficit. <p>Bamana DeMoro
