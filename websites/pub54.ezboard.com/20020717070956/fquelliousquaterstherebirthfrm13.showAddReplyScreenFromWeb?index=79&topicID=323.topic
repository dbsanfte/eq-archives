<br>
So actually, it has everything to do with the topic and we addressed that.<br>
<br>
People who make 'twinks' tend to 'twink'.  So that was also addressed, along with the masses of forgotten wizards who leveled to 15 then people found they were so hard to level they made a monk.<br>
<br>
It was brought into the equation and was addressed.  Even fairly interesting to some maybe, learning for others.<br>
<br>
The use of MB against SoL or SoV mobs was brought into the equation due to people showing that its pretty much a toy and that it's greatest use is only against about 4 mobs in kunark.  While others may use it against more uber mobs in the game, at that point it remains a toy pretty much. <br>
<br>
So your topic about 'nerfing' MB against Kunark mobs would in fact pretty much waste points that have been spent in AA, as it would pretty much just be a toy instead of a tool.<br>
<br>
If that has nothing to do with your post then /shrug.  Learn more about your topic before you post or prepare to get upset with what people say about it.<br>

I have said previously, I do not need any Kunark mobs ... so why would I get upset ? Hehe, quite the opposite in fact ...<br>
<br>
And your point about nerfing the toy versus a potential 4 mobs is not really a relevant point.  Naggy / Vox = 2 mobs nerfed for all 52+ ... thats only 2 mobs and the same concept behind nerfing those apply to wizards MB. <br>
<br>
They didnt want 1 group of high level people farming those mobs for themselves.  <br>
<br>
If they dont nerf MB v Kunark mobs, why dont they make Naggy/Vox a killable mob for any one group of 60s? <br>
<br>
Hippocritism of the highest order of Verant if not....although I appreciate that the world has expanded somewhat from then.  <br>

If i'm correct (wizards please tell me if I am not) you are told to save MB for the last 20% when all the melees are rezzed, buffless, and clerics running hardcore OOM....<br>

it's one shot. After that, they need to med, or use right clickies. Again, wizards, correct me if I err, but i do beleive I am correct....<br>

MB is just alot of damage instantly. <br>

I believe they may have failed to realize that today, it is 10x easier to raise any class, including wizard, from level 1 to 60 then it was when we all started our primary class. The removal of some of the death penalties in the first 10 levels, adding of rezes to much lower levels, removal of hell levels below 50, etc. have all made it possible to raise any class to high levels easier. Adding in the ability to twink alternates, multiple accounts, and powerleveling from guild mates we would often be shocked at how fast it is to level any class, including wizards, to level 60.<br>
<br>
Heck, I had a wizard guild mate in my guild last October who was being played by a 17 year old high school student. He got the game in first week of October. He dinged 60 on Thanksgiving weekend. That was less then 2 months playing. Granted, I believe this guy was an exceptional person, but you all would be a bit suprised by how many exceptional people can exist in a server with a believed subscriber base of 3000-4000 people. And give those people the ability of guilds to back them up to get to that, I think you will be in for an eye opener by July to September. In fact as a guild leader and officer, I can very much believe that many guild leaderships are currently looking at what it will take to get 3-4 guild wizards with manaburn as part of their desired guild resources to be right there with their 5-10 epic clerics and 4-6 level 60 warriors.<br>
<br>
But, as for getting manaburn nerfed for the reasons of it will defently be abused by the grief players in the near future? I think that will be like throwing the baby out with the bath water. One of the biggest advantages of manaburn, IMO, is that it really allows some smaller guilds to compete with the top tier guilds on much of the middle level encounters then any other addition that has been place in the game. With two or three wizards who have manaburn, a small to medium guild now has the ability to field a raid force to take on these dragons we are discussing here much quicker. Unlike the epic clerics and level 60 warriors who still need some equipment base to be of major advantage to a guild, a manaburning capable wizard really only needs level. Any guild can make characters reach a level. It does take upper tier guilds to get awesome gear for their warriors. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Manaburn is about the best thing that has been done for the small guilds, IMO.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

but a real wizard will know the true benefit of manaburn beyond 4 dragons.<br>
<br>
<br>
People have come up to Dev members at fan faires and asked about manaburn and they said it was fine.  Excluding a few dragons from manaburn's use would require a bit of programming. And if there was a nerf depending on the degree you would piss off an entire community of wizards rather than keeping it the way it is and a few outsiders complaining. <p><center>

About leveling the wizards...<br>
<br>
- Spells havent changed and thats our damage output.  So nothing has increased our damage capabilities or efficiency damage/mana since kunark...no easier leveling there.<br>
<br>
- Removal of hell level... the same amount of exp is needed 0-50 with hell levels or without...it's just spread out more even...ne easier leveling there.<br>
<br>
- The ability to twink...You cannot equip a pure caster to do more damage.  Maybe until level 20 ( which is easy anyways ), but with their offensive capablilities capped so low, the faster ratio weapon you give them, the faster they miss...At level 60 and 20/30 epic and all buffs possible, it still takes me forever to kill an orc cent in WC.  You can increase their manapool but in damage over time and with mana-regen level based, it ends up with the wizard leveling at the same rate of his mana-regen...no easier leveling there.<br>
<br>
- The ability to powerlevel...Druids are the best class to powerlevel and with a 50+ druid friend ( who bought me the game in the first place ), theres a point around level 30 where mobs start taking a wizard out faster then the druid can heal.  Our defense is capped way low, ac is nothing and hitpoints are very low.  About this time you lose the ability to tank ( ie, use of damageshields for PL'n ) so you are back to having to kill the mob yourself.  The only class that can help you kill faster to make much of a difference is if you had a 60 chanter with c3 on a second computer.  15 mana a tick is a far cry from the benefits of damageshielding/buffing a melee and letting several mobs smack on him.<br>
<br>
*net result*<br>
<br>
- Powerleveling has increased since kunark only of the amount of c3 for a pure caster, a far cry from 10x.  This holds true for levels ~30 to 60+ all the AA point exp to get manaburn.  About the only item I've found that really speeds up the process slightly is the rare Solist Icy Wand which is a right click stick that does 30damage which becomes kinda useless after the late 20s.<br>
<br>
Defense and Offense caps along with very low defense and offense stats stops powerlevelling very fast in the mid to upper levels where most of the time it takes to level is.<br>
<br>
Some people though who play obscene amounts of time (I'd never do this laff ) can level a player just by spending the constant hours very fast.  If you spend 20 hours a day for 2 months you can level a wizard to 60. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Such as the famous Xarinthus who did level 59 in 35 hours of straight playing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   but he's a nut. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Sure, Lots will start an alt wizard ( like they do all the time ). powerlevel them to 30-35 then realize that it just doesnt work very well with this class as it did on their monk.  Then put the wizard in their closet.  I get numerous tells from people like this who reached the frustration point and asked for suggestions.  I laugh and tell them thats it different and they'll actually have to play the character.  Most of the time they give up.  Heck, most of my friends have wizards at this point still in their closet.<br>
<br>
Of course, there will be exceptions to this, but to get several of them together at the same time after they get manaburn will indeed be rare.  It's hard enough with the wizards on the server now with this ability.<br>
<br>
Anyways...<br>
<br>

OK, tell me how 4 wizards would fair against Phinny, VS, RoS dragons, etc without manaburn?  They wouldn't stand a snowballs chance in hell without it.  Therefore, it is safe to say that manaburn, in this circumstance, is more effecient then using classic nukes.  Why?  because without manaburn the team would die, they would die terrible terrible deaths... which is very ineffecient.<br>
<br>
Your arguement about the gating mobs can be used in the exact same way against regular nukes, I could say that ice spear, sunstrike, etc would be more effecient not used at all... because I'd rather take the chance the tanks/melees do good enough on their own.  Which is complete BS.<br>
<br>
Verant gave us mana because they wanted us to use it, not so we could keep it all stored up forever.<br>
<br>
Also Kindir, how far have you played your wiz?  Obviously not far enough to realize the error in your ways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uqutsemnie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 135<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/28/02 9:32:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=323.topic&index=89>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This may touch some nerves, but WTF lets see what happen</span><hr size=1> naw 4 wizards couldnt rotate epic rune and start a taunt conga line.<br>
