<br>
Tiqua, don't take this wrong. But if you saw Cukkak pulling then you saw him die. Then Montague went and pulled. Why did you wait for Montague to pull to say anything.<br>
<br>
And where <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you guys anyway?<br>
<br>
Look I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> regret this happenned</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. I would have let you guys go <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> if I had known</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. From my knowlege of them I am fairly confident at least 4 if not all of the other Wizards would have done the same. You had no presence when we zoned in. You said nothing the entire time I was there. Of that I am CERTAIN.<br>
<br>

<br>
GOOD!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Then we will not have to have this sort of conversation again.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Its just this group who im sure knew about the other raid going on for him. - RealTipu<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We didn't know. Well let me restate, *I* didn't know. Mont said there was no /ooc. Ferdian and Cukak said they had been there the whole time, and they hadn't heard an /ooc.<br>
<br>
Ok lets assume they were lying to me for a second. That's even more reason for people to announce their camp if you have no visible raid force! Maybe you have one bad burner but isn't it less likely if you let them know <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> before they pull</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that at least some will say 'hey man this isn't right, I'm outta here'.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Just curious, you all said that you Cukak (spelling?) was camping Sev for the MB 'raid'. But you said he was a necro....why does a necro need to camp Sev....to my knowledge, Sev only drops War and Pally epic bits - Monty<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I didn't know why Cukak needed the green scale. But he apparently did enough to camp EJ since serverup. I assume a guildmate needed it. Or Cukak was letting a War friend use his toon since he could camp it relatively 'safely' because of FD. Which to me is a perfectly valid reason. I was just asked to come help when he popped. I had no prior association.<br>
<br>
And in a good guess as to the answer to your question the following:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I consider Gray Soldiers a mid level guild. We have a part of a Manaburn Squad.<br>
<br>
It is because of them that we have completed epics gotten very rare shaman spells etc. At least in GS the drops are NOT sold but GIVEN to guildies. We it not for MB we would not be progresing at anywhere near our current rate. - Bubbalotski<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ferdian and Cukak are both GS. I will assume some GS Warrior is now one step closer to his epic.<br>
<br>
How AWFUL of them.<br>
<br>
Those FARMERS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Tal we only had three in the zone before FK spoke to me and I called the guild mobilization off. - Palazaious<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Thanks for giving me a chance to tell THAT story to Palazious.<br>
<br>
Did I or did I not ask you if you wanted me to ask the burners to back down?<br>
<br>
Did you not say no?<br>
<br>
Did I or did I not tell you that if a scale dropped (which was what you needed) I would press to let your bard have it?<br>
<br>
It didn't drop, which saved me from having to ask, but I would have, and you know it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And from the wizard response, we need to start asking permission from them to try raids on the dragons. - Talasar<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nope. No one said that. All anyone said is that if it's close you should ask, and hopefully the convention will be established that the Wizards will back down. Or don't talk to them and lose. Do what you will.<br>
<br>
Talasar your rhetoric is specious in the extreme. You know damned well that's not what anyone is saying. There is no Wizzie council to decide these things. These mobs are FCFS. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> support the idea that burners should back down if it's obvious a raid is forming. And by that I mean OBVIOUS. Either tell them or /ooc or have an apparent presence. (IE not just 3 tagged people in zone)<br>
<br>
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BE NOISY. Don't talk to them personally if it makes you feel better. Just make your intent plain.<br>
<br>
All this 'beg wizards for permission' crap is dishonest.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Traditional raid is going to have a hard time competing with MB team. Even if most people in guild are already there (nobody AFK or LD), everyone is grouped, chat channel set up and hot keys ready, duties assigned, resist gear on, all buffed, everyone at least 80m... a single group of wizzies should be able to finish preparations, move, and pull faster every time. - Juror<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well thought out post Juror. This is why I think burners need to be extra careful to have the appearance of propriety. But they should not be expected to be telepathic either. I don't want this situation to recur. How hard is it for the raiders to '/ooc prepping for Sev please do not interfere, thanks!'?<br>
<br>
Note they don't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> need</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to do this if they have 12+ tagged people in zone.. in that case it is obvious.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Why do MBers place the burden on raid leaders to speak up? A large force is the norm, the until-hither picture everyone imagines necessary to bring a dragon down. - Esmalyn<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well the obvious answer is because if they don't they may lose the kill. But you are right a large force is the norm. And there has still not been any case where a burn team has seen a large force and said 'screw it lets takem!'. You never even hear about it because they just leave if a large force is there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You aren't asking the MB wizards for permission if you advertise that you are forming a raid, you are establishing prior claim. If you don't want to advertise that Sev is up and risk having him yanked, that is ok too. But don't hold others to standards you are not ready to live up to. - Djjinn<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I could not put it more succinctly.<br>
<br>
And apparently <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> didn't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in all these pages of posts because some people still are not getting it<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
All this is an interim problem. Soon most guilds will have full in house burn teams. Burns will be the standard way you get these epic pieces and that will be that. It will be back to guild rivalry as usual and the rogue element of pickup burn hits will be out of the picture. At which point these discussions will be laughed about as being so naive. And in PoP there will likely be Epic Mk2 and all this will be passe, anyway. Hell lots of luclin drops make many epics look sad. PoP will likely make Epics obsolete except for the anal retentive.<br>
<br>
In the mean time a little civility and politeness will go a long way to smoothing things out. If you assume burners are going to be dicks, and treat them that way then they may act like it. If there is polite communication I hope and believe that you will continue to find them reasonable and willing to hold themselves to a higher standard than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would hold yourself to.<br>

-- FK quoting me<br>
<br>
&quot;Well the obvious answer is because if they don't they may lose the kill. But you are right a large force is the norm. And there has still not been any case where a burn team has seen a large force and said 'screw it lets takem!.' You never even hear about it because they just leave if a large force is there.&quot;<br>
-- FK<br>
<br>
Still, where is the harm in an MB team doing the same? After all, you do fashion yourself after a raid force. Does shame, a twinge of doubt keep MB teams from announcing their intentions to the zone? Won't it make it easier for people to keep tabs on how many dragons are falling to an MB team? Does that bother you? I was surprised to read you guys took 3 down in one day. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontyydaogre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montyy Da Ogre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>fat ass</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/26/02 12:38:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=108>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> seriously, can we PLEASE nerf FK's quoteing privelages? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  geez, enough is enough already...<br>

Holy assling crap, this is perfect. Imagine it now - black robed MB wizards looking menacing near Kunark Dragon zones, their familiars wearing gold chains and wingtip shoes. Then a lower level non-MB wizard wanders up to your raid...<br>
<br>
----------------------<br>
<br>
LowbieWizard067: So, word in da zone says dat yous guys are lookin at whackin da local dragon, right?<br>
<br>
Raidleader002: Uh, maybe...<br>
<br>
LowbieWizard067: Yous plannin on bringin ya own certified MB Team?<br>
<br>
Raidleader002: Uh, our guild doesn't have any MB'ers.<br>
<br>
LowbieWizard067: Oh, dat would be most unfortunate. Da Boss *points to the MB wizard off to the side* is very concerned about da health an safety of yer raiding membership. He will rbing help, for an agreeable sum or loot default.<br>
<br>
Raidleader002: Uh, we appreciate it, but we can handle it, and we need the loot drops for epic quests. Thanks anyway.<br>
<br>
LowbieWizard067: Oh, well, have yous scheduled it wit da boss?<br>
<br>
Raidleader002: Schedule?<br>
<br>
LowbieWizard067: I'll take dat as a No. I can pencil ya in, fer a nominal fee of course. While we're on fees, have yous paid yer Raid Protection money yet?<br>
<br>
-------------------------<br>
<br>
Organized crime meets EQ in the form of extortion rackets based around MB wizards. Guilds paying protection money, I can see it.<br>
<br>
Still, someone else made a comment regarding &quot;Why would the presence of 3 wizards in a zone make anyone think anything is wrong?&quot; <br>
<br>
This person probably was not playing in the old days. I can recall times, way before PnP, that the appearance of a wizard in Highpass/HHK was cause for major consternation. Back in those days, it was even odds that any wizard you saw loitering there was a KS'er. Highpass was touted as FFA and certain unscrupulous wizzies used it as a personal playground for KS'ing. <br>
<br>
As a result, whenever you were grouped in Highpass, you most certainly did consider any influx of wizards to be a major concern. This did nothing for the rep of the class though, and many wizards have fought long and hard to correct the mistakes made by those who came before. The problem here is that the occassional callous attitude will simply cause a return to the generally incorrect attitude that wizards are all KS'ers.<br>
<br>
Still, to defend those who are unjustly wronged by the generally baseless accussations towards MB'ers, _every_ wizard I know personally is scrupulous and honourable about their ability. _Every_ time I have seen MB used, it has been topical and helpful, and the raid/group was _damn_ glad it was available. I like MB, and the wizard class in general. I hope they don't nerf MB as a whole. I just wonder what will happen if natural progression takes its' toll and the current, scrupulous crop of MB'ers is replaced by a bunch of zipperheads.<br>

<br>
Cukak is the necro yes, I have no clue why he needed sev.<br>
<br>
Cukak ALSO won the scale.<br>
<br>
If Cukak indeed tried to sell the scale to the warrior of the other guild for 90k, well - hes been officially added to my blacklist, and I wont ever be manaburning with him again.<br>
<br>
And just a side note, it was my opinion that Cukak shouldn't of even got to /random for any loot.  He has tried pulling sev before and due to the fact that sev is sow'ed, he has died each time.  A necro is fine for most dragons, but he needs to let a bard or somebody with a decent horse do sev.<br>
<br>
<br>
To Cukak,<br>
If you tried to sell an epic piece to the warrior, especially for 90K... Your a fucktard and i hope no other wizards let you pull for them.  Grats on looking like an idiot. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontaguethesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montague the Sorcerer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/26/02 12:54:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontaguethesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montague the Sorcerer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Social Butterfly </span><br>  Posts: 356<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/26/02 12:58:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=112>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

No harm at all. Except that what happens is if burners SEE someone getting ready to kill something they don't bother to negotiate.. they just leave, which is what you will agree should happen no?<br>
<br>
This is only an issue if you intend to kill something and are trying to get people there but aren't ready yet.<br>
<br>
If the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  burners</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are there last they are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> going to ask the other people if they can have a shot?;P Come on.<br>
<br>
'Hey we see you setting up to kill Gore.. mind if we burn him?' Get real that's not going to happen. The burners just go away.<br>
<br>
Don't get confused.<br>
<br>
No one is saying you have to beg. But if you do NOT have an obvous raid force (and sorry 3 tagged ppl is not an obvious raid force) then yes you should take some care. Prudance suggests you /ooc it occasionally.<br>
<br>
We are only talking about close calls. But by the same token no one is going to advertise in /auction 'sev is up, does anyone want to take him? if not maybe we will'.<br>
<br>
Through no direct discussion we seem to have as a server have come to some self enforced standards. No competing guild will give you the benefit of the doubt a burn team will.<br>
<br>
Whether this convention will continue will be determined by the tone of discussions such as these.<br>
<br>
Again these issues are going away as more guild have in house burn teams.<br>
<br>
The whole problem will be moot very soon.<br>
<br>
FK<br>
<br>
PS I still have not heard who was selling the scale. I think it's crap because they said a 'Wizard' and did not know at that point that Cukak was the one who got the scale. Cukak is a necro. (and yes necros make no sense for dragon pullers but hey it was not my raid, have to admit he had balls tho)<br>
<br>
If it's really true let's hear a name. I know the name of every burner there. (most have already been mentioned) Name names or go peddle your hoax elsewhere. But if it's really true we need to know who this person is. I think most guilds might be interested to know they have a person who could have helped a guildmate with his epic but decided to sell the item instead. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufaithkills.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faithkills</A> at: 7/26/02 1:06:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usfemwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>S Femwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of Beer</span><br>  Posts: 366<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/26/02 1:24:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=114>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> (This message was left blank) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usfemwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>S Femwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/26/02 1:28:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uvariousboneweiser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Various Boneweiser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/26/02 1:24:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=115>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> Communication.....<br>

What would you do if your main was a War and you had a friend with a necro? Or an MB Wizzie? Or any other class that is a better choice to camp something like this?<br>

I still do not know this is not the case, and see nothing wrong with it. Ferd and Cukak are GS and I must hope that it was given to a GS warrior.<br>
<br>
The scale (1) and book (1) I have gotten have gone to guildmates, gratis. More have dropped but they went to some Bard or Pal that talked to us and needed it.<br>
<br>
And I have a very happy Warrior guildmate that has a CoF, also gratis. It's what good guildmates do for each other.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have any reason to think Cukak sold the scale?<br>
<br>
I don't but would be certainly interested to know.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what they sell for.. because I have never sold one, but I would think they wouldn't be but 10 or 20k. Warrior epics are more merit badges than anything else.. there's lots of better weapons and the price of those weapons would put a max price on each part of a warrior epic. 90k seems absurd.<br>

But what do I know.<br>
