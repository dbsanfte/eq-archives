I think it was obvious to most the Paladin class had taken the place in EQ of what the cleirc is in most other D&amp;D based games. All you had to do was play a cleirc for about 10 lvls to know you wont be in the thick of the fight.<br>

Thats exactly why I played a cleric when EQ came out.  I thought I was getting D&amp;D online.  My two favorite classes in D&amp;D were clerics and rogues (rogues because it was fun to cower and be pathetic and lie and backstab people, or kill people in my party and blame it on a troll =P).<br>
  An EQ Cleric has very little to do with a D&amp;D Cleric at all.  I remember in my lower levels getting the DoA spam invites every day, and I would stoutly deny them all the time.. well for 2 reasons.  Most of them were tards, and I always saw Apotheke doing her &quot;cleric&quot; job, which was sitting there just healing her DoA group as they tore though mob after mob gettign exp.  It didnt look like any fun to me, well i later adapted that playstyle and learned to have fun in it as well.  But at the time that sort of thing just looked ridiculous to me, and being that the cleric class was not set in stone, as it is now, I was determined to make my cleric my own way.  This meant using my ITU running into the house in unrest, finding a ghoul or soemthing and yaulping and nuking it while i beat on it with my hammer of wrath!!..  ok so it took me a couple weeks to get from 15-20 this way, and I died multiple times a day =)... but I had fun!<br>
<br>
I later learned what it was like to really be a cleric in EQ and how to perform my set role efficiently, and that this game was not to be a roleplaying game, that it was in fact quite hard to roleplay.  I still have had the most excellent time being a cleric in just a healing role, but I have never ceased to maximize my melee ability any way i could through weapons and gear and spell line up whilst soloing.  <br>
<br>
Whats this &quot;only need one warrior on a raid&quot; mentality =P?  What did you guys raid?  I think its best to have 4 or 5 warriors on any raid.  Even in the most beautiful flawless fight the MT can always drop to enrage if the healers and him are not on thier toes... then who is gonna tank the mob?<br>
<br>
Or how about doing those ridiculous flurry drakes in tov using one warrior.  You can either wait ages for defensive to recycle on your &quot;one and only needed warrior&quot;, or you can send him in undefensive, either way if he dies you have a lot of problems to fix the situation before slow hits those things.  Anyways I always thought it was nice to have at least a bare minimum of 3 warriors on any raid..... we certainly always used all the warriors we had availiable.<br>
<br>
Dont even list that lull line as a useful spell either.  You may wanna try to log that cleric in and try to go Lull something =P.  At least he can rez himself after he trys, or you can always ask Salta how uber &quot;Wake of Tranquility&quot; is =P.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well I guess a lot of classes are still lacking balance and no one seems to be happy with whatever proposed balance because of class envy.  I am sorry that I was allowed to have fun for a day.  The hammer in its original form now appears to be a drop in ssra from an ubermob instead, meaning I will never get it again, and only with a lot of money (which I do not have, which most clerics do not have).  So now top tier guilds will have clerics who are balanced.. like yay.<br>
<br>
<br>
Im with Answer on this.  Clerics are not this easy class who get this oh so special treatment.  It is true that uberguilds have special invite policys jsut for clerics because of the way the game mechanics work agaisnt ubermobs.  I don't think clerics are to blame for this, not do i think many clerics started a cleric jsut so they could get  into one of these guilds.  Nor do all clerics want to get into one of these guilds.  Bottom line is, it is a hard job, it is rewarding and fun dropping a mob for the first or second time, it is however tedious and boring to do it again and again, as well as requiring a cleric to be there from start to finish of the raid.  Clerics leaving disband raids, and you do not want to spoil the fun of 40-50 people for your own self interest when you can avoid it.  You want those people to have fun to.  Many clerics are not happy with such an obligation or such an important role in the post velious raiding environment of EQ.  I wish they would jsut give shamans and druids full CH and be done with it.  Give me the hammer or some other fun alternatives, and they can have the damn CH spell for all I care =P.  It is about fun, and a lot of EQ is not fun unfortunately.  THis was fun and I want it back!<br>

bah....i soloed my first 15-18 lvls  and this was three years ago.  but its at that point where we do not get the same melee abilities as regular melees.<br>
<br>
You know, it would be nice to be able to log on for only an hour or so and to solo instead of spending that time trying to find a group or having your friends move to where you are. <br>
<br>
With the stuff VI put in, we are not even close to the best melee'ers in the game.  It was just giving us the option to be able to melee.  Our non-undead dd's suck, i think someone said we had some good spells (mipp i think) like blind an lull.  Give me a fucking break.  Everyone and their brother knows that the lull line maybe works 40% of the time and when it doesnt, you get all the mobs on you...making this spell worthless.  That blind spell is worthless as well.  Our stun line is very good though. <p><strong><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=158388">Feadorn Lifegiver</a></strong><br>

Now this was well before every fucking twink was weilding lammy's...this was when an uber warrior had a couple of Langseaxe's...you remember those?  When the MOST UBER WEAPON a tank would ever MAYBE see was a couple of Yaks.  Hell a Mithril 2h Sword was around 10k then which is probably equivelant to well over 100k by todays standards.<br>
<br>
I soloed my way to around 20 also...Meleeing, tanking,  and nuking my way through orcs, dervs, and gators in oasis.  At that time as a previous poster stated, the cleric class was not set in stone as it is now. It was not obvious that a clerics role was going to be that of a heal/rez bitch.  Back then there were not really any large raids like we have now...a raid then was like MM castle or L Guk.  CH Rotation?  what's that? Now..Just heal and stfu...that's the life of a cleric.  <br>
<br>
If things had progressed on the same level from then to now as far as the Melee ability of a cleric compared to that of a Warrior/Paladin, Clerics would always have been a viable solo class, but that's not what happened.  Other classes got better and better Melee gear where clerics put shit like a paw of opalla into their main hand just for the wisdom.  Why have a weapon?  Of course back then Rangers were tanks and Druids were gods....now look at those classes. /snicker<br>
<br>
Now I made an art of finding something else to do besides heal.  I was often known to run out and nuke shit while on the CH team.  Did it in NTOV...did it on THO...did it on just about every mob to include AoW..Tunare (Even though the slut resisted every one)...you name it.  So what I'm saying here...shit i forgot what my point was...anyways...who in the blue hell are you?  oh yah that was my point. <p>Gimily Smashfist 60th Cleric (retired)<BR>Gimilly Smashfist 59th Warrior</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwooweewoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wooweewoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/6/02 1:32:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=499.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IMO...</span><hr size=1> don't know what clerics are thinking....you should have expected the nerf on the proc.  if you know what you are doing, you would know how overpower it is in solo and group (when you see pal rather heal and cleric just melee in raid, you know there's something wrong).  If you want to blame anyone, blame VI for not testing fully before put them to live.  Btw, 2 clerics in same group can do a lot of diff things, unlike wars in raid--either be MT, or hit attack and go afk =P. You probably just havnt figure out what 2 clerics in same group can do.  <br>
<br>
and druids...if nothing changes for druid soon, good luck finding any druid online (o well..there are always port-bot and those in raid guild~).  Druid won't get group for sure as of today, thx xp nerf and cleric buffed up--now no one would want to hunt in easy place and those are the only places where druid can be an ok healer.  You won't see many druids solo either, i can get more xp in a raid trying to KS from overnuking wiz than quad kiting whole day.  (Sad to see my best option for xp is from a raid.)  <br>

anyway...it's all stupid VI's fault.  don't think any company can be so dumb.  basically, they killed 14 classes in 1 patch while make clerics solo better and be even more wanted in group. no wonder ppl get so mad...and if you are a cleric and can't see what's wrong..open your eyes please!  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwooweewoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wooweewoo</A> at: 9/6/02 1:35:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufanainy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fanainy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/6/02 1:44:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=499.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IMO...</span><hr size=1> PSST,  they fixed the exp penalty.

<br>
It doesnt take a genius to figure out the role a cleric will play later in the game, early in lvling.<br>
<br>
I solo'd as a cleric and I solo'd as a warrior. <br>
Clerics have it easier, and with the new patch it was ridiculous. Verant made a mistake and they fixed it, anyone that doesnt agree with it doesnt give a shit about other classes and their abilities being over powered by a class that has powerful abilities already. I think Fea said the new weapon is now a dropped item, go get it and stop bitching, if not, wait until they upgrade some melee classes. I assume then, they will worry about us. Atleast that is my hope.<br>
<br>
Clerics will always be powerful and always needed, im glad everyone had fun with the melee and I assume we will continue to have fun with it, now though, it wont cost other classes that needed an upgrade more than us as much anguish.<br>
<br>
I think the clerics having the problem with the change in the patch are speaking from high end raiding terms. <br>
<br>
I have always had fun with high end raiding, I may not be from a huge guild, only a family guild, but as a cleric I am asked to come to other guilds raids often. <br>
<br>
Perhaps those that got burnt out from raiding so much as their cleric should find more interesting things to do with the class, it sounds to me the way and places you raid is the problem, not the class shortcomings. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usfemwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>S Femwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/6/02 3:11:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugimily.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gimily</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/6/02 3:35:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=499.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: funny shit.  clerics get more solo'n attention.  </span><hr size=1> I found something more interesting to do with the class.

<br>
As far as &quot;the way and places you raid is the problem, not the class shortcomings.&quot; how the hell does that make any sense.  I played the class from the first bat outside of Kaladim to the ends of Ssra Temple.  The fact is if you are a cleric in a raiding guild you WILL experience burnout.  And for a lot of us those chummy chummy family guilds just don't cut it.  We need more.  What we need is the challenge of the hardest mobs.  Now that's all well and good...the problem lies in that after X_Uber_Mob_01 dies then what?  You've got a guild that has 13+ clerics online because that's what they needed for the mob they just killed.  You think there is gonna be 13+ Exp groups forming up?  Nope.  Most of the Melee are gonna go solo.  Most of the wizards are either gonna form AE groups for which one cleric is more than enough or go quad kite something.  So what's all the clerics gonna do?  They're gonna log.  And maybe next time they don't log on because after all that cool shit killing all those uber mobs they still spend hours upon hours findin an exp group.<br>
<br>
You don't have any idea about any of this.  All you know is in your little world you probably don't have too much trouble getting in one of the guild exp groups number one because most of your Mellee can't solo like the endgame mellee can and number two they're probably aren't that many clerics in your family guild.  You also probably don't have too many with the powergamer mentality that you see in a lot of the endgame guildmembers where they feel like the MUST GET THAT NEXT AA SKILL to be effective so they solo instead of grouping with the cleric that is trying his damndest to get MGB so he can help the guild out more.  I'm here to tell you that I've been in chummy chummy guilds like yours back in the day and it doesn't even compare to being a cleric in an endgame guild.  Now I gotta say this LC is great to their clerics.  You won't see clerics gettin bitched out in LC's guildchat I can tell you that.  That's not true for some of the other guilds out there.  This only adds to the problem.  The perspective I speak from is that of one of the what 50+ clerics on Quellious alone in the end game guilds?  And that's not even considering Explict and RIP.  All these clerics and nothing to do.  So fucking what if it was a little overpowered.  Hell i'm not even a cleric anymore, but I can tell you this...If it makes the clerics happy and keeps em raiding I sure as shit aint gonna bitch because without them I don't get the phat lootz.  And that's the bottom line. <p>Gimily Smashfist 60th Cleric (retired)<BR>Gimilly Smashfist 59th Warrior</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usfemwood.showPublicProfile?language=EN>S Femwood</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Goddess of Beer</span><br>  Posts: 454<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/6/02 3:45:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=499.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: funny shit.  clerics get more solo'n attention.  </span><hr size=1> ahh yes, phat lewts is not the bottom line for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I know there is a problem with cleric burnout, I have experienced it myself, but after these raids why not go and find a group outside of your guild?<br>
<br>
Just like I said its the places you raid, you are in a raiding guild and you obviously dont have fun doing anything but that.<br>
<br>
I dont see raiding as the EQ end all, I have fun with friends, help out when needed, and XP grind when bored.<br>
Or I play my other chars, burnout isnt something clerics feel alone.<br>
 <br>
Your solution is to sell your cleric, mine is to play in different settings where CH isnt always the best way to heal and a CH chain isnt needed.<br>

rofl I had that same thought when someone mentioned lull.  Upper Dogs in velks requires a 59/60 puller to get most single.  We had a 57 war or something and he had never pulled before and I had gotten all the way to level 60 before even trying out the uber spell &quot;wake of tranquility&quot;.  I had always heard it sucked but needed to experience it first hand.  It went something like this....<br>
<br>
You tell the group &quot;okay i'll try this ae lull, you go in and pull once I'm done casting&quot;<br>
Random pickup group warrior &quot;okay&quot;<br>
You begin to cast wake of tranquility.<br>
Your target resisted the wake of tranquility spell.<br>
Your target resisted the wake of tranquility spell.<br>
Your target resisted the wake of tranquility spell.<br>
an icepaw warrior looks less agressive.<br>
Your target resisted the wake of tranquility spell.<br>
Salta tells the group &quot;omg 4/5 resisted let me die&quot;<br>
You have been slain by an icepaw champion<br>
Salta tells Elsatia &quot;ready for rez please!&quot;<br>
<br>
Not only is the resist rate extremely high (even against level 10 mobs) a resist causes aggro.<br>
<br>
As far as my comments go you don't need to be in an uber guild to solo in FG.  I didn't say everyone had primal and a fun tunare snare item.  However, items with slowing, rooting, regeneration are effects that dont require an uber guild to attain.  My point was that you claimed the only shot you had as a warrior was hoping you can make the mob run out of hp before you.  As a counter to that point I listed options that are available to melees that makes it more than just killing the mob before it kills you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ucenainnknightofpurity.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CenainnKnightofPurity</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I Kill Gnomes</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/6/02 4:58:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=499.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: IMO...</span><hr size=1> Clerics = Pallywannabe's now with this patch =p Muhahah <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If there's a problem with clerics, destroy the one thing they can do well so that people will leave cleric for a better class! It's brilliant!<br>
<br>
Of course, if I'd said &quot;If druids can't heal in the endgame, STFU and start the cleric you should have rolled in the first fucking place&quot; I'd get flamed from head to toe - and rightly so. But since this is clerics, and not druids, it makes perfect sense!! /boggle.<br>

The people who play clerics tend to LIKE playing clerics. What they don't like is everyone leaving them all alone after raiding is done because they might slow down that all important XP/second. <br>

Agreed! So these soloists should allow clerics to join them, since nobody should discriminate based on the actual utility of a character! Ah, but people DO discriminate based on utility, don't they? When a group wants a damage dealer, they don't go get a bard. When they want a healer for raids, they don't get a druid. And when they want healing for XP grinds against low blues, they don't get a cleric.<br>

Now what I said was not intended the way it was taken.  I wasn't saying that all I am after is phat letwz...what I was saying was appreciating the clerics out there because THEY are what makes the endgame possible for EACH and EVERY one of us.  Lord fucking knows I didn't feel all that appreciated when I was a cleric so I'm just bein supportive.

It is about time clerics get some melee recognition as they are probably the worst class that can solo useing melee. Warrriors, monks, rogues, rangers ect. have many high dmg low dly weapons and almost always have an uber proc. Druids can obtain a 1hs that get a 150 root proc from a fairly easy mob. Int casters get a rod with a high dmg proc. Shamans have many spears with a nasty poison dot proc. While clerics have few good melee weapons. IMO clerics should have the best melee weapons out of all preist/caster classes because they have the shittiest dmg spells (not including undead, since not every exp zone has undead mobs).<br>
I don't completely agree that clerics are left in the dust for groups after raids because if someone really wanted a group there is no problem getting one with around 2k people being logged on all the time.<br>
The high end game is absolutely about the loot no matter what anyone says. The simple task of getting your epic or clearing VT has the same goal in mind. Starting a new character once you hit 60 means you have left the high end game and your back at the beginning.You can always return, but then your back in the same situation.<br>
Different people play for different reasons. Wether it be to hang out with friends or get phat lewtz your both having fun. So discriminating against others for being loot driven is saying you hate them for doing the same thing you are doing.<br>
Hopefully those who play clerics will enjoy the upgrade. I think the best thing about it is that clerics have the ability to do more challenges because they are now more diverse. I see warriors do self AE grps, bards solo klandicar, monks solo bristelbane, and I personaly like to pull =) So grats to clerics and thanks verant for opening a new door to them. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=180053">Ryowen</a><br>
