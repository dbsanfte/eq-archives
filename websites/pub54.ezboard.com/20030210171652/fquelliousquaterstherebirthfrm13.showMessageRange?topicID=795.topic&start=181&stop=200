<br>
The way I see it, division makes us stronger in ways we can't always anticipate. Debating in a public forum reinforces freedoms we may take for granted from time to time. In the end, one side will lose the pro/anti-war argument, but in the process, as individuals, we will be that much stronger for it. (How in the world did we survive that Civil War?!)<br>

<br>
Will my lack of support pave the way for the apocalypse, make oil prices pierce the stratosphere? What major catastrophe will befall the US if I decide to pick up a sign and join an anti-war demonstration march? For someone who is on the right side of the war issue, you, like others, make it sound like the Bill of Rights could not survive an angry shout in an otherwise peaceful assembly. You elevate a difference of opinion to an act of treason when dissidence is exactly what the Constitution encourages to check powers.<br>

You knowI bet a lot of other sides believe exactly the same thing. We dont need to let our conscious dabble in issues of right and wrong, cause and effect, as long as we stay nearsighted.<br>

<br>
I dont need proof. Regardless of whether or not Saddam is keeping nuclear/biological weapons he needs a killing for all the other crimes he has committed against humanity. Saddam isnt going to march out there in all his glory and meet us head-on, though. Hed likely bunker down beneath a hospital, in a city. I wont even ask for a count on the percentage of you pro-war people who think its just justifiable to kill citizens to eliminate the threat. Its also the aftermath that gives me pause, like Quts elaborated on. (Id agree with you more often Quts if I could figure out WTF youre saying half the time.) To top it off, killing Saddam will NOT eliminate international terrorist activity (emphasis on i-n-t-e-r-n-a-t-i-o-n-a-l). Personally Id rather slake my thirst for revenge with bin Laden than have a president redirect my rage to settle and old score of his.<br>

Dont give me that shit Pottz. Ive crawled under wire, gotten mud packed in places I did not know existed before in the process, and shrieked in the shower, tears springing to my eyes, from blisters the size of boils on my feet, and managed to earn a Navy Achievement Medal, among other awards, in my six-year enlistment. Disagreement, even outrage, is NOT A PRECURSER for anti-nationalism.<br>
<br>
As for petroleum-based products, a large part of why we are still dependent on foreign countries for oil has to do with relentless lobbying from gasoline industries. (Does that make me a big industry hater too?) The lack of financial support from the government to automobile companies for researching increased fuel efficiency is depressing. Toyota and Honda have taken the lead with their hybrid cars, but they break down too much, and the average consumer may find the MSRP high. Good thing, though, Toyota plans to expand the hybrid concept to their other vehicles, and perhaps the cost of manufacturing them will level off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=varro@quelliousquaterstherebirth>Varro</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/20/03 7:43:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=183>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:OT - Opposed to the war with Iraq?

I'm just gonna pick a few points:<br>
<br>
Maybe I missed it if this has already come up, but the above article mentions the CIA directors belief that the real threat is in backing Saddam into a corner where he will almost definately use and distribute weapons of mass destruction.<br>
<br>
If UN resolution violations are a reason for war, then we should go attack Isreal.<br>
<br>
I can't believe a right winger quoted Locke (one of the founders of classical liberalism), and then questioned criticism of national leadership.  How about you read the whole book next time.  I've read Locke way too man times (stupid political science major!!!).  <br>
<br>
Criticism of the government is one of the fundamental rights granted in the first amendment to the constitution.  Do you think the founders followed the king absolutely? bwahahahahaha!!  I will always critique our nations behavior and consider it my patriotic duty to do so.  Those who cry patriotism and don't critically analyse government policy are simple nationalists.  (You remember nationalism right? that thing that is a key component to fascism?)  <br>
<br>
While the US must do all in its power to protect itself, war should be the last resort.  Inspections may seem inane, but if our intelligence is really so conclusive, then maybe it will be able to do something.  According to my military intervention instructor, Isreal is on record as saying it will defend itself against attack unlike in the Gulf War, and Bush has agreed that they have the right.  If Isreal is brought into a conflict with an arab state, be prepared for the possibility of escalation.  <br>
<br>
Say we defeat Saddam and remove him from power, then what?   The majority of the Iraqi population is Shiite and a simple democratic system would probably give rise to Shiite dominance and create a very strong ally to Iran.  <br>
<br>
This is not the Gulf war with a coalition of nations and unprecedented support from Arab states.  Though I'm somewhat underwhelmed by Iraqs military strength (as witnessed in their uncoordinated efforts during desert storm), a ground war into Baghdad will not be a cake walk, especially without greater land rights support to allow a better deployment strategy.  <br>
<br>
We may be headed towards a protracted conflict with possibility of multinational escalation.  This conflict may create the environment that causes Saddam to use and spread the WMD's we're currently so worried about.  Let us try to disarm Iraq through international means in conjunction with our intelligence.  At least we should attempt to disarm as much as possible before going to war.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=feadornlifegiver>Feadorn Lifegiver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tolapumj wanna-be</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/20/03 9:49:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=795.topic&index=184>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:OT - Opposed to the war with Iraq?

And the possibility of him using them anyways is still very high.  This is the person that gased his own people... and he also gased Iranians during their war.  There is a greater risk by inaction than by action.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If UN resolution violations are a reason for war, then we should go attack Isreal.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
None of the UN resolutions call for any action against Isreal.  The UN Resolution against Iraq does.<br>

It's funny.  you cry about people who criticize you and claim 1st amendment rights.  But the people who criticize you also have 1st Amendment rights as well.  If you dont like it, ignore it.<br>

They have had 12 years to comply.  I think that is plenty of time.  Just because Clinton wanted to ignore Iraq and Terrorist doesn't mean that the next president should.  12 years is plenty of time and every ave. has been exhausted with Saddam only moving his WMD projects so that they cant be found.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Say we defeat Saddam and remove him from power, then what? The majority of the Iraqi population is Shiite and a simple democratic system would probably give rise to Shiite dominance and create a very strong ally to Iran. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  IMO, that country would stay together for the simple reason that no country around it really wants to see it broken up.

It will be a bit harder than the previous gulf war, but it will still be pretty easy.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>We may be headed towards a protracted conflict with possibility of multinational escalation. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Who else is going to join in on saddam's side?  Only way it might escalate, is if they gas Isreal.  And the chance is, they would accidentally gas the Palastiens instead.<br>

No longer do we represent the pillars of freedom and justice, the keystone to the system that was developed from Lockes tretise on government is that we exist in a state of abundance, which means that there is enough for all, we have created an artifical state of scaricty, until we begin to realize we are slaves to the Corparation that truely control the elected officals in this nation, we are nothing but slaves with playstations.  &lt;rant off&gt; So briefly i am opposed to war, all war, no war is justified. With in this day and age there is no reason that peace can not be maintained.  Warmongers fight for reasons but never for safety, justice, or any other noble virtue they attempt to attach to there destruction. <p>If you cant find Happiness, I bet you got stoned and forgot where you left it<br>

Being pro-action,  I understand that I am in a lose-lose situation in any debate.   I also understand the pro-peace side is in a win-win situation in any debate, which makes all arguments circular, and pointless.<br>
<br>
<br>
We act,  I lose, as war is never *wanted*, the threat is handled, but because a major catastrophe is averted, I lack an event to &quot;justify&quot; the action.   You win, you get to protest and take the holier-than-thou attitude and can run down the government policies as imperialist warmongering. <br>
<br>
<br>
We don't act, and something like 9-11 happens (which was a direct result of us ignoring Al-Queda and Afganistan after repeated attacks on our embassies and military... go go Clinton!  At least Clinton outright admits he screwed up in that regard publicly)... something like 9-11 happens again and I lose, the action I supported to stop this kind of thing never came.  You win,  peace was maintained and you get a whole new reason to protest, more potential action to fight against as we *finally* move in to &quot;imperialist warmongering&quot; mode a little too late.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Peace at all costs is what allowed Hitler to take over half of Europe before anyone so much as threatened him to stop. It's what allowed Afganistan to devolve, allowed Al-Queda to continue to escalate it's attacks with no reprecussions for a decade.  <br>
<br>
When was the last time Lybia was a major threat?  Can you possibly argue that Afganistan is not better off than it was 2 years ago now?  That kuwait should have stayed occupied?   The mistake with Saddam happened 12 years ago..... we liberated kuwait but didn't actually fix the core problem then, and it's coming full circle now.   <p>Gurunt Bangoo &lt;Wraith&gt;<br>

I will be forced to support a military action against Iraq, when i can be shown proof, not the press release from the Ari fliesher, when someone can say with evidence to back it up, that iraq not only has WMD.  Technology this have in the first place in the case of biological and chemical weapons because we sold them to them in the first place.....Donald Rumsfield knows someting about that.  It comes down the this, the UN says wait, the inspectors say we have not found anything yet, and they are not hampering our searches, Bush says i am tired of these games, if the UN doesnt support me, it has no credibility.  That is not cause for war, maybe all the reasons i put forth our wrong, but you can not tell me that think that the President and the Nixon left overs are being honest with the american public.  Afghanistan is much worse off, the only part of the country that has any form of law and order is the captial and the land needed for the trans-afghani pipeline.  Opium production has skyrocketed 200%.  Regional warlords..aka the northern allaince that the American government paid to fight for us, control the rest of the country.<br>
<br>
Zolina, if we want to help the Innocent Americans, maybe we should spend less on bombs, more on security...since mutally insured destruction is no longer a fessible means of detering a attack, and spend some of that left over money on things like social progarms....but i guess those are just hand outs for the lazy people.<br>

- OMG this is possibly THE most blatant display of sunshine up the ass, black and white, wrong/wright stupidity I have EVER heard. No war EVER? sooooooo we should have let Hitler steamroll through the rest of Europe and eventually us? We should sit back and let terrorism continue to grow bolder and bolder until none of us are safe? COME ON! Get off your high horse they fucking attacked us in our backyards ... TERORISTS did! Now I am not saying that absolutely we need to go to war to solve problems but to say NEVER is naieve. If you believe that Saddam had nothing to do with that atack, fine believe what you want, perhaps you will get a new corvette from Santa next year.  <br>
<br>
The bottom line is Saddam should have been removed from power the first time and it is going to have to happen eventualy. We can agree to disagree but the truth is that none of us on either side have all the information that will lead to an educated decision or probably will, that is something that we must leave up to our ELECTED officials. I vote, do you? (aimed generally as a question) If we voted them in then we obviosly trusted them to make decisions for our country. Let it lie and save your demonstrations for things we may all possibly have all the important facts about.  <p> <p align="center"><a

Someone clue me in on some of this logic...<br>
<br>
<br>
Someone who says what we did in Afghanistan was bad and uses it to potray us as some world Imperialist Dictator....   If you feel that way, don't post about it here... go to NYC, stand at ground zero, and tell it to the people rebuilding there.  I like how no anti-war protester ever had the balls to go to the recovery site and protest.  <br>
<br>
OR... someone who says that actions after 9-11 was ok, but only until somethign worse happens should we take any means to actually protect ourselves further.  Next time some terrorists blow, poison, or irradiate something here, and we get another few thousand dead, and the perpetrators are AGAIN linked to Iraq if they aren't Iraq directly next time.... are you gonna stick to your guns and say the dead were worth it?  That they were &quot;necessary&quot; for things to come to a head?<br>

Frankly, I'm not too worried about my local radio free iraq station being bombed anytime soon. Yet this along with empty warheads are enough to start a war amidst a sea of global apprehension towards the US's quick approval of military force? <br>
<br>
We should be taking out Al Qaeda in its entirety. Theres no doubt about that...but where besides reading into G.W.'s ambiguous one-liners has there been any proof that Saddam = Al Qaeda?? People link Iraq and Sept. 11th as a means of generalizing that area of the world. Personally, I don't see any reason why a country who blatantly admits to violating the nuclear nonproliferation treaty like North Korea wouldn't be MORE likely to give an anti-american group weapons. Much moreso than Iraq.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As stated in taped appearances by its leaders since the September 11, 2001 terrorist<br>
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the goal of Al Qaeda is to<br>
destroy high profile U.S. targets in order to end what Al Qaeda claims is U.S.<br>
suppression of Islamic societies.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> - hmmm... is Saddam Islamic? Yes. I know this is a sweeping generalization, but interesting none the less.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In 1989, after the Afghan war ended, he returned to Saudi Arabia to<br>
work in his familys business, the Bin Laden Construction group. However, his radical<br>
Islamic contacts and protests against the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia to combat<br>
Iraqs invasion of Kuwait caused him to run afoul of Saudi authorities.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  -  They have been buddies since the 1st time we kicked Saddam's @ss, perhaps before that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Czech officials say an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague<br>
met with September 11 lead hijacker Muhammad Atta in early 2001, reportedly to<br>
discuss an attack on the radio facility. Some observers believe the meeting suggests<br>
an Iraqi role in the September 11 attacks.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> - nough said.<br>
<br>
My point is there has been SOME evidence and alot of speculation that we KNOW of linking Iraq and Bin Laden. I don't think it we now have or may ever have all the facts relating to the nature of that connection. Ask yourself one simple question ..... do you THINK the 2 are connected?<br>
<br>
 The point of any worthy debate or argument is to make points trying to convince the other side that your view is worthy. I am willing to accept the fact that POSSIBLY war at this stage is not needed (though I feel it is) if you will agree that there is a possibility (and I think a strong one) that the 2 are linked. What angers me in this whole debate is the fact that people are saying war is not the answer, in fact Palater said he doesn't support war .. EVER... WHAT IS THEN? Its easy to say &quot;You're doing this wrong&quot;, but not so easy to sugguest an alternate idea. It is exactly this type of pacifism which makes us vulnerable. Once that line has been crossed (and it has been) where people are not affraid to come into our back yards and attack us, we must do whatever it takes to defend ourselves from them.  We don't know all the facts and all the intelligence our government has, we may never know. But we must trust those in power to lead us and to make the difficult decissions that none of us would ever want to make.<br>

There have been money links from Saddam and a number of Al-Queda aligned/supporting groups, and direct meetings between Iraqi officials and 9-11 suicide bombers... some of them in Iraq.<br>
<br>
Now, would Saddam likely to be convicted in a U.S. court of law were he a citizen of the US?  Not likely, it's mostly circumstantial.   This isn't analogous to a domestic court issue. <br>
<br>
There is one reason we aren't as militarily mobile vs North Korea right now as Iraq.  China.  China and NK aren't at the high point of their relations, but they still have enough ties that China could very well intervene if we move to fast.   Of course &quot;too fast&quot; is relative... the Iraq weapons issue is 12 years old.  So we are already moving a lot faster on NK than we have on Iraq.<br>
<br>
You mention we found &quot;only&quot; a few dozen empty chemical warheads and the like.. realize the conditions of the inspection team.  They give advance notice (in terms of days) of where they will search, and they are then escorted there by Iraqi chaperones.   Up until JUST recently the whole thing was a giant joke.... one of the big fusses Iraq had was when we insisted the lead time we give them for inspections was reduced to a few days rather than 10 days plus.  Heck Iraq was pretty pissed when we demanded to have more control over where we checked and what was off limits as well.<br>
<br>

<br>
That pretty much sums up the last decade of US inspections of Iraq.<br>
<br>
The fact that with a few days notices, and armed Iraqi escort the STILL manage to find anything incriminating *at all* is rather disturbing.   <p>Gurunt Bangoo &lt;Wraith&gt;<br>

<br>
<br>
That's right: Kevin Bacon.<br>
<br>
Bunch a rubes falling for a pretense, that is what I see here on the pro-war side.  Line up suckers, the land- and resource-grabbers that cooked up this sob story about saddam being a big wheel in the pro-islamist terrorist movement are laughing all the way to the bank.<br>
<br>
Look, if you just want to kick some ass, that's cool, everyone feels aggressive now and then, and this is no less true of nations than of individuals.  Or additionally, argue that it is simply in the geopolitical-economic interests of the US to secure a stronger hold over the enrgy resources of the Middle East.  <br>
<br>
But please, stop with the &quot;seven degrees of separation&quot; sob story theories &quot;But But!! Saddam killed lots of mommies and daddies on 9-11 because someone in another intelligence agency is rumored to have heard an Iraqi was in the same town as Mohammed Atta!!&quot;  If you think ANY serious geopolitical strategist gives a fuck about dying mommies and daddies, and would let such sob stories influence their sheer power and control mindsets, you are just too naive.  Real global politics are about power, first, power, second, and finally, power, third.  The only people who believe the sob story covers the press feeds the benumbed wankers who sit in front of their tv's pounding their fist and their beers are aforementioned benumbed wankers, and prolly President Dubya, who is basically a &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot; in the political realm, a cruel cruel joke the American people have willed on themselves: he claims to be a leader, but he is really just a benumbed wanker who believes the little stories the real players feed to him like lullabies to a baby.<br>
<br>
Hey, and observe: you don't even know if I support military action or not.  But I do know the difference between reality and tv-sob-story-propaganda.  We are not going after Saddam cuz he killed someone's mommy.  We are going after him because he is vulnerable to be knocked off and he sits astride a valuable geopolitical and economic power nexus that our power-fuckers want to fuck long, hard, and deep.  The rest of you keep dreaming your little dreams on your moral la-z-boys about sad puppy dogs and how Saddam does not like apple pie.  I'll live in the rather more brutal, and far less morally smug, world of real politik.<br>
