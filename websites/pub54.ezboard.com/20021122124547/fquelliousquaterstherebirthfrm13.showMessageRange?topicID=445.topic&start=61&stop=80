The head of the FBI might as well have said &quot;We dont believe in your right to privacy. The FBI finds your right to privacy to be restrictive.&quot;<br>
<br>
The effect of this law is to go as far as the FBI can to circumvent the right to privacy.  ITS IN THEIR WAY.  It cant be clearer by this act.<br>
<br>
But thats the rub.  The right to privacy is more then a law.  Its a belief.  Its a way of life.   Recruiting non fedreal civilians to act with federal agents to circumvent your constitutional rights is sick.<br>
<br>
I want a government that believes in my rights.  Not one that is trying to doctor up technicalities to circumvent them.<br>

Perhaps I wasn't as clear as I should have been, but I know from previous discussions that you're smart enough to glean what I meant.<br>
<br>
Hitler didn't start out as a cackling, mass-murdering fuckhead. If he did, he wouldn't have gotten elected (yes, Germany was Democratic then). He revitalized the German economy, made overtures to those countries to which Germany owed money, and then took advantage of the complaceny of the world powers to gather his own power base and launch a devastating global war.<br>
<br>
I see Bush attempting to revitalize the US economy.<br>
<br>
I see Bush taking advantage of 9/11 to gather power to himself and make war on those countries that he doesn't like.<br>
<br>
I see Bush, during some near-future crisis, being declared pro-temp Supreme Leader (or maybe not, something similar to what happened with Johnson during Vietnam will suffice) and making war on the Middle East, which will lead us to devastaing global war.<br>
<br>
Where perhaps I went wrong in likening Bush to Hitler was genocide. I don't think Bush will do anything quite so organized as that. What I fear will happen is the painting of the biggest thorns as terrorist sympathizers, which we all know is treason, punishable by death. Nevermind the small thorns in our conquered empire-puppet states, who won't even make the front page.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just too big a believer in history repeating itself, but I see a distubing trend, and one that I'm none to pleased about. I'm starting to think that complacency will be the death of the free American state. <p>Lauriston Pianoforte<br>That Guy<br>Bard of Quellious</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ubulvaihammersson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BulvaiHammersson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 136<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/3/02 7:11:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=445.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: political rant: /sigh bush</span><hr size=1> &quot;That's a bit different.

<br>
My father served in the US Army for 24 years. During the Chicago riots back in the 60's, he was in the 82nd Airborne Div (and served in that div numerous times as he liked jumping out of perfectly good airplanes). They mobilised the 82nd to quell that riot. For about 3 weeks you had soldier, hard-core shooters from the 82nd, marching down Chicago streets with loaded rifles. Sounds like a police state nightmare, but no civilians were hurt/killed and the riots stopped dead.<br>
<br>
Am I advocating such use of the military, not particularly. It did work though.<br>
<br>
As far as mobilising that military against the people, I'm not the best person to ask, but what I recall from Constitutional Law courses was that the statute regarding military deployment and the office of the president are fairly muddled. Arlen Specter is currently sponsoring a bill specifically designed to prevent the president from making war without the assent of congress. Specter would not be sponsoring this bill if he did not think the law was open to Bush making war without congress' go-ahead.<br>
<br>
&quot;And if you can neither see where this is going or coming from, I beg you to take a closer look. Since the HSA will technically be counted as a military agency, with jurisdiction over the interior, they will in essence be an undeployable multi-capability unit.

<br>
I'm not sure I see this. The HSA is military? Are they under the Dept of Defense? I admit to not keeping that close a tabs on the recent changes, but I thought they were associated directly with the office of the President in the Organisational Charts. This would mean they had similar status to the CIA and such agencies. From what I've seen, that HSA will not need the power of arrest in itself. It can simply turn over what info it has to agencies like the FBI and they'll arrest. Again, I've not kept up on recent changes.<br>
<br>
I do see what you are saying here, but I still think that it is a touch early in the game to be this alarmist. It does scare me a bit. I am, as I've said before, a conservative and Libertarian, and I dislike the feds having any more power than they've already got. My idea for the HSA was a simple clearinghouse of data, allowing inter-agency communication. It is apparently becoming much more than that, both from what I've seen and what you are saying. Still, I cannot see it, just yet, as jack-booted thugs. That would too closely infringe on the BATF's charter =)<br>
<br>
&quot;Hitler didn't start out as a cackling, mass-murdering fuckhead. If he did, he wouldn't have gotten elected (yes, Germany was Democratic then). He revitalized the German economy, made overtures to those countries to which Germany owed money, and then took advantage of the complaceny of the world powers to gather his own power base and launch a devastating global war.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, Hitler was democratically elected. Heck, he was Time's Man of the Year at one point. He started out as a Good Thing for Germany. The problem here is the lack of proportion in your argument/analogy. Germany was devastated by WWI, and the agreements that were forced on them were utterly emasculating. Were we not involved in that war, a better balance of power would've been achieved and Germany would not have needed the Little Corporal. This is another argument though.<br>
<br>
America is NOT in the same boat that Germany was in. You don't have currency so devalued that you need a wheelbarrow to carry enough money to buy bread. You don't have infrastructure so poor that it is easier to walk to the next town to buy supplies than it is to wait for the delivery to your local store. You don't have an utterly crushing disarmament of the nation. There is a major problem of scope here. America is nothing like post-WWI Germany in scope.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see Bush attempting to revitalize the US economy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Every leader of every nation with a flagging economy tries to do the same. Anything else is political suicide. Again, I ask what is wrong with this?<br>
<br>
&quot;I see Bush taking advantage of 9/11 to gather power to himself and make war on those countries that he doesn't like.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, agree and disagree. I see the steps he is taking garners more power for the govt, not necessarily himself, though it can be argued that strengthening the govt strenghtens the president. I do not see him using it as an excuse to make war on countries he doesn't like. We didn't give two shits about Afghanistan before this, and, as I've said before, I see no evidence of a war in Iraq at all.<br>
<br>
&quot;I see Bush, during some near-future crisis, being declared pro-temp Supreme Leader (or maybe not, something similar to what happened with Johnson during Vietnam will suffice) and making war on the Middle East, which will lead us to devastaing global war.&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow, this isn't a leap of whimsy, this is an around-the-world-tour of whimsy! How did we get from &quot;Bush is trying to revitalize the economy&quot; to &quot;W, Supreme Secretary, World Govt&quot;? Is this like those descriptions of FTL Drives in sci-fi books that include the step &quot;And a miricale happens here&quot;?<br>
<br>
&quot;Where perhaps I went wrong in likening Bush to Hitler was genocide. I don't think Bush will do anything quite so organized as that. What I fear will happen is the painting of the biggest thorns as terrorist sympathizers, which we all know is treason, punishable by death. Nevermind the small thorns in our conquered empire-puppet states, who won't even make the front page.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, no one has been seriously tried for treason, and I doubt it'll happen. Treason is a n offense punishable by death. The feds are loathe to pull out that power due to world attention. It's apparently ok for Texas to execute a serial killer, but the world media would probably have a field day if the US executed a Traitor.<br>
<br>
Another problem here is that our biggest thorns are terrorist sympathizers. <br>
<br>
&quot;Maybe I'm just too big a believer in history repeating itself, but I see a distubing trend, and one that I'm none to pleased about. I'm starting to think that complacency will be the death of the free American state.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some of the indicators are there, but I stil think that your sense of history is ignoring your sense of proportion. History does repeat itself, but Americans of today are a far cry from thee wrecked shell of a people that populated Germany post-WWI. Bush is nowhere near as charismatic as Hitler. And there is no Nevillle Chamberlain on the other side. I think Tony Blair would be the first to stand up and call Bush on the carpet if he started to turn into the Little Corporal.<br>
<br>
Still, we aren't on opposite sides of the fence here, Lauriston. I am fond of the phrase, &quot;I love my country, but I fear my government&quot;. I think we need to keep tabs on what our govt is doing. I just think that, in spots, you've gone far afield in your comparisons. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

European countries had to learn how not to agitate each other and &quot;contain&quot; each other through use of force.  They now contain each other through treaties and diplomacy.  But you don't do modern diplomacy and treaties by stationing troops and provoking &quot;regime changes&quot;.  That is pre-world war thinking.  The US is basically 100 years behind European nations in terms of understanding how to be a modern nation in terms of dealing with other nations.  There are other issues as well; we could talk about the insanity of trying to teach people that using violence to solve problems is unacceptable by putting people who use violence to solve problems to death.  (The death penalty **reinforces** the violent criminal's tendency to think wrongs deserve violent reactions.  Murderers who kill people for &quot;disrespecting&quot; them are, in other words, simply following the lesson taught by the death penalty)<br>
<br>
And I still stay by my point.  Europe is more wary of war because they have seen it happen in their own lands.  WW1 and WW2 were devastating ordeals for Europe.  The US only sees war on TV.  And then, when terrorists destroy 4,000 or so American lives on American soil, we have the naivete to recoil in horror as if the world has never seen such atrocity before.  Sure it has.  Every year.  All over the place.  It's just that we Americans only see it on TV.  <br>
Americans are rich, clever, industrious.... and arrogant, isolated from the real world, aggressive, and about 100 years behind the rest of Western civilization in terms of moral understanding.  <br>
<br>
Combine a country with 19th century notions of empire-building and real politik, and 21st century warmachine technology unmatched by any other country in the world, and a population whose deep awareness really only extends back to the trivia from the previous season of Friends or Everybody Loves Raymond, and you have a real problem on your hands.  <br>
But that's ok.  Because America is gonna teach the world how to be free!  We are freedom!  We are moral truth!  And we have God on our side....<br>
<br>
And let me add one more thing.  It is one of the most difficult things a person or people can do to come to an awareness that their homeland, their country, their nation, is not all peachy-keen.  Maybe THIS is what WE need to learn from WW2.  The Germans could not face up to the fact: our nation is horribly and utterly corrupt and wrong.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the most blessedly patriotic thing a man can do is recognize his dear country has big problems.  Its a lot like recognizing maybe your parents are not perfect wise beings.  Time to grow up kiddies.<br>

<br>
America pulls it troops out of an area that hasn't finished pulling itself into the modern world. That area degenrates into violence, chaos, and despair. Panama and the Phillipines are both examples of this. <br>
<br>
America leaves it's troops in place in numerous European countries because those countries want us there. We also happen to have bases owned by foreign powers herein the States now too. There is at least one German Luftwaffe base that I can think of in New Mexico or Arizona. It's a grand idea.<br>
<br>
Regime changes are attempted when the rulers of a nation prove that they are not mature enough to handle the power. You are a self-professed peacenik, yet you'd rather see Saddam Hussein in power than not? While I do not advocate war with Iraq, I do advocate a regime change, especially in a rogue state like Iraq.<br>
<br>
As far as containement through treaty, containment works when the nation being treated with is willing to respond to reason. Did we not try damned hard to bring accord through treaty and diplomacy in both Iraq and with the Palestinians? Admittedly, little diplomacy was attempted with Afghanistan, but there wasn't much of a govt to be diplomatic with.<br>
<br>
&quot;The US is basically 100 years behind European nations in terms of understanding how to be a modern nation in terms of dealing with other nations.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I somehow don't see this, as we aren't exactly practising Battleship Diplomacy as was de riguer in the early 1900's Crazy, but true, we aren't taking our Navy and Army into lesser developed countries to rape them of their resources and establish puppet governments. We allow our private corporations to do that.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are other issues as well; we could talk about the insanity of trying to teach people that using violence to solve problems is unacceptable by putting people who use violence to solve problems to death. (The death penalty **reinforces** the violent criminal's tendency to think wrongs deserve violent reactions. Murderers who kill people for &quot;disrespecting&quot; them are, in other words, simply following the lesson taught by the death penalty)&quot;<br>
<br>
This is simply inane. The death penalty has been discussed and debated forever and a day now. It has been shown to be economically inefficient, it has been shown statistically inefficient, it has been shown to be statistically efficient, it has been shown to do everything but jump up and dance. The bottom line is that some offenses are so grave as to only be assuaged by one measure, and a measure most final it is. There are those so removed from humanity as to be no longer human. They should thus be treated accordingly in the very end. To do less is to show deep moral weakness to the rest of society, so deeply damaged by such diabolical actions.<br>
<br>
Our penal system is horribly broken nowadays, much of this is due to overly compassionate folks, probably like yourself, that have overemphasized the &quot;correct&quot; in corrections. Felons today are punished primarily by their fellows via &quot;jailhouse justice&quot;. It is no wonder that our recidivism rate is so damned high, given how essentially soft our prison system is.<br>
<br>
&quot;And I still stay by my point. Europe is more wary of war because they have seen it happen in their own lands. WW1 and WW2 were devastating ordeals for Europe. The US only sees war on TV. And then, when terrorists destroy 4,000 or so American lives on American soil, we have the naivete to recoil in horror as if the world has never seen such atrocity before. Sure it has. Every year. All over the place. It's just that we Americans only see it on TV.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is inane. Please point out any other instance in history where so many people in one nation have been murdered in one instant in such a brutal, unexpected, and unexplained fashion. Certainly massacres have occurred in many nations, but I cannot think of another example when it was so many, so unexpected, so well televised, and so instantaneous.<br>
<br>
You did not recoil in horror? What kind of person are you? I am unashamed to say thatm by your definition, I am naive as I certainly felt deeply the horror of that event. It is probably unfortunate for me, by your viewpoint, that I am not as internationalist and as jaded to the suffering of the world. It is surely better to be like you and not feel the outrage that so many of us feel at this act.<br>
<br>
I have quite a few British friends. They've suffered through the Blitzkrieg and the Battle of Britain etc, yet they recoiled in horror at the events that day. Are they naive too?<br>
<br>
&quot;But that's ok. Because America is gonna teach the world how to be free! We are freedom! We are moral truth! And we have God on our side....&quot;<br>
<br>
Please. Do you still live here? Do you pay taxes and accept govt support, drive on govt roads? Have you expatriated yourself yet to some bastion of true freedom like, oh, Cuba? All I see, is the same parlor dissident BS, bitching diffidently about how awful America is whilest sipping on a latte.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see an alternative. Those nations that are generally held up as better examples of freedom either oppress far worse than we see here, or simply have succumbed to anarchy and freedom of self-expression occurs only because you have troops backing your voice.<br>
<br>
&quot;And let me add one more thing. It is one of the most difficult things a person or people can do to come to an awareness that their homeland, their country, their nation, is not all peachy-keen. Maybe THIS is what WE need to learn from WW2. The Germans could not face up to the fact: our nation is horribly and utterly corrupt and wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's not difficult in the slightest! Every year on April 15th, I am confronted again with how wrong some things are in the system. Everytime I see the latest numbers on how much money is being wasted on crap like the welfare slave-mill, everytime I see yet another piece of trash lawsuit that is as pointless as the day is long. The difference between you and I is that I also see the good. I have been to other nations, seen truly corupt regimes in actions. I know what the alternative is. There is bad here, but there is also a helluva lot of good. I feel sorry for those who can't see it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sometimes the most blessedly patriotic thing a man can do is recognize his dear country has big problems. Its a lot like recognizing maybe your parents are not perfect wise beings. Time to grow up kiddies.&quot;<br>
<br>
The most blessedly patriotic thing you can do right now is to just go out and be a normal, law-abiding citizen. That is the best way to supprot your nation, economy, and fellow man. There is nothing patriotic or unpatriotic about realizing that this and every nation has problems. It is simply recognizing reality as it stands.<br>
<br>
And part of growing up is realizing reality as it stands. Part of reality is that there are people out there that will bash you in the head to take what you have, and all the treaties in the world won't stop them. The only thing that stands between you and them is the protection of law and the men and women who enforce it, both here and abroad. Peace is a lovely idea, but violence is hard-wired into our code. <br>

Just a guess though and that is a subject for another thread.<br>
<br>
I wasn't going to post on this and get into a debate until Ketel brought up Isreal.<br>
<br>
Saddam is evil.  He isn't Hitler insane but I think evil is a general label you can give him.  He wants nuclear launch capabilities.  The only thing he wants more than that is to use them on a country that would really piss us off.  <br>
<br>
What he doesn't have is a delivery system.  He will never be able to launch from Iraq and hit the US.  However, if the world keeps saying &quot;C'mon Saddam, be good, pretty please&quot; he will have the ability to hit Isreal sooner or later.  Whatever side you are on with the Isreal situation doesn't matter.  The fact is it will hurt many people in the US.  It will also have the nasty side effect of half a million men, women and children dead.  The Arab world for the most part will look at any Arabs that die as dying for a great cause, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Here is the thing with Saddam.  Many people are niave of how the world works outside of their safe town.  You can not talk to some people and work out a deal in a civil manner.  <br>
<br>
Look at this board for example.  You can have two people fighting over something.  The first has good points and is clearly in the right.  The second responds with a jumble of text and nonsense that they think is funny but is really just dumb.  Guess what?  There are adults like that.  Adults that run countries and can have a nuclear weapon.<br>
<br>
In my opinion it is a matter of getting him before he gets somebody else.  It is a bad situation and it will be a real shame if the US is left to do it alone.  Something has to be done.  Weapon inspectors are a superficial fix that really is a watste of time.  What is needed is a government there we can trust and work with.  If it comes down to it be glad you are not being sent there and support those who are.<br>

And as for the US taking a proactive role in rooting out and destroying terrorist activities, lemme just ask this, how many of you that are posting your opinions on whether or not US troops should be fighting this war actually servered in the Military or have any clue how it works?  Well I for one was a Medic in the Navy for 7 years(and damn proud of it), and plan on returning after I graduate from college.  Where I will be the first to state that I'm ignorant as to logistical and tactic details of warfare (hell I was a medic) I do however have alot of background in the weapons of terrorism, and thats Chemical and Biological warfare.  Being a Medic, and being stationed overseas we all were trained...and I don't know about you all but I'm 100 times more scared about some psycho brewing up a batch of Smallpox then I am of Hussien getting a nuke <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The events of 9/11 only blew away our ignorant beliefs that we were safe from terrorism, and that by ignoring it it will go away, well I'll tell ya something, its not.  Did you know that the first Trade Center Bomb (the one in the parking garage a few years back) had a biological agent attached to it? Yep sure did, but it was destroyed when the conventional charge went off (poor planning on the terrorists fault) But that didn't make the news cuz it didn't kill 1000's of people <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Just think folks....we as a people (Americans)haven't been immunized against Smallpox for over 30 years now, and those that have prolly have a weak immunity at best now, 1 outbreak of this disease in a populated area has the potential to kill millions (remember all biological agents start off with simple 'flu-like symptoms' then you die <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) Do we really want people running around this planet with the desire and the means to create and deliver such devestation? Hell Saddam used chemical and biological agents on his own damn people..... whats to stop him from using them on others? <br>
<br>
What's it gonna take you get support? Does a whole city have to die from a Smallpox outbreak? or maybe a few thousaund Knicks fans will choke to death on their own secretions when someone puts Phosgene into the air system at Madisen Square Garden when the Lakers are in town?<br>
<br>
In closeing I for one support ANY efforts made by the US and its Allies to eleminate terrorist activity across the globe, and after I finish school next spring I plan on rejoining my shipmates in the efforts to do just that.<br>

Just a quick thought on this one.  If it wasn't for Patton and Monty coming up from North Africa, Hitler could have used those forces against the Russians and would have probably won.  And if it wasnt for Ike holding back Patton (so that Monty could have some glory) the war would have been over before it did.<br>
<br>
Question is, should we have listened to Patton at the time and taken out Russia while we had the chance? Hmmm <p><strong><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=158388">Feadorn Lifegiver</a></strong><br>

This is nonesense. The fact is the US is the dad that everyone assumes will bail them out if they get trouble. Europe has accepted for the most part the geographical status quo. However they don't deal well with aggressors. WW2 points this out eloquently. They thought Hitler was very gauche and thought if they gave him some things he'd go away and be satisfied. Had Europe as a whole reacted swiftly and expediently as a unified force the tragedy that was WW2 would not have happenned. They were complacent and it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the US that had to bail them out, for whatever reasons you think, altruistic or selfish.<br>
<br>
Hussein is a bad actor. He would be Hitler if given half a chance. He did try. But unlike Hitler in WW2, the US just shut him the hell down when he invaded Kuwait. Imagine how much more pleasant history would have been had someone just shut Hitler down when he reincorporated the Saar Basin. Had Europe as a whole stood up and said &quot;Well I guess you just didn't get it the first time&quot; and smahed him the first time he violated the Versailles treaty how much better would things have been?<br>
<br>
Further Hussein does support terrorism and allowing him to continue to exist encourages others that support terrorism.<br>
<br>
He dearly needs to be liquidated.<br>
<br>
My concerns are:<br>
<br>
Eroding Bill of Rights in the name of 'National Security' and anti terrorism.<br>
<br>
If we do take Iraq, what the hell do we do with it?<br>

Its in every history book. The Germans were like &lt;100 miles from Moscow, until troops needed to be diverted to the western front. Russia was not going to &quot;steamroll&quot; anyone, it was going to be a long drawn out war.<br>
<br>
Also, the U.S. hasn't had to declare war on anyone cause we can effectively get the world to back us, or engage the enemy under the guise of the U.N. The U.N. serves to extend the views and interests of the U.S. It is a tool of the U.S. to deceptively gain support for actions that, in the long run, benefit the U.S. the most. <br>
<br>
Bush is a hot head when it come to foriegn affairs, he is DEATHLY afraid following in the same footsteps of Bush Sr., Jr. wants more success. Having any discussion at all about the leader of the freeworld talking about how he is going/willing to start a war with Sadam to remove him from existence is a very hot tempered action. Having the side of Isreal, Egypt and the Kurds in the region really doesn't allow you much in the support of regional support. If the locals Suadi Arabia, Iran, and other Islamic countries are not asking for his removal, or doing anything for themselves concerned with his removal then Bush will only be stepping on toes, very vigialant toes.<br>
<br>
Yes, Bush had/has enormous support for his response to Sept. 11th but unless he succeeds in wiping out Al Quaeda from the face of the earth his actions against them will spur more violence against the U.S. and its powerstructure.<br>
<br>
Psst the Al Quaeda see them selves as a nation/state of people much like the Kurds, which collectively makes their viewpoint of U.S.'s actions as disruptive and terrorising. Especially, when there is no declaration of war against the peoples of Al Queada. Just because we don't recognize their claims doesn't mean they are not legitimate.<br>
