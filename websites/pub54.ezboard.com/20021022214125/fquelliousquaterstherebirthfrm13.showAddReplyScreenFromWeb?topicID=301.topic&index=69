I was never speaking legally, I was taking the standpoint of having a child. Its the parents responsibilty, period.<br>
 <br>
What would happen if parents started thinking differently? <br>
&quot;Its my kids fault, they know what they are doing.&quot;<br>
<br>
This of course is one of the tricky parts of raising a child isnt it? Letting them know they are responsible for their own actions, all the while knowing you are.<br>
<br>
I am wishy washy on trying children as adults, I know how insane I was as a teenager, I know how everything seemed like the end of the world. <br>
<br>
No one can manage feelings when they are so overwhelming, not to mention they dont have the experience to do it. And yet we want to judge them as if they have the knowledge to control and understand what they are feeling? <br>
I dont know, it would take alot of convincing for me.<br>
<br>
I do, however, agree there is a point where we have to admit a person is screwed up and there is nothing we can do about it. <br>
But not a teenager, @#%$ their bodies havent even completely formed yet. <p> <BR><img src=http://sachem.freewebspace.com/images/sach2.jpg><BR>

&quot;It's always parents' fault when a child do something wrong. It's not becoz they did not watch their child from doing something wrong 24/7. it's becoz they didn't teach their child what's right and what's wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
This statement is false in so many aspects that I don't know where to begin.  As a future sociologist and black sheep of a &quot;good family,&quot; I can tell you that parents can not, no matter what they do, control a child.  It just isn't possible, unless the child is willing.  Or unless the parents literally brainwash them.<br>
<br>
Don't believe me?  Look at a family with 3 or 4 kids.  Do they all act the same way?  Do they all have the exact same beliefs and opinions as their parents?  Check it out, you'll be surprised  out how wrong you were.<br>

I figured someone would eventually bring this up.<br>
<br>
Let's look at it, maybe use some words with slightly different connotations.<br>
<br>
You are, we all are, the sum of our genetics and experiences. That's it. There's nothing else there. It's either there at birth, or happens later.<br>
<br>
Hmm, Nature = genetics. Nurture = experiences.<br>
<br>
So basically, we are the sum of Nature plus Nurture.<br>
<br>
Well, Nature/genetics is pretty much locked at birth. Your genes will stay the same, excepting certain rare mutative influences such as carcinogens or radiation. <br>
<br>
Nurture/experience happens constantly, changes constantly.<br>
<br>
Well, as a parent, you are responsible, directly, for both.<br>
<br>
As a parent, excepting adoption or surrogate parents of course, you provide the genetic material. You and the other parent are DNA donors. Thus you are directly and irrefutably responsible for the &quot;nature&quot; part of the equation. <br>
<br>
We can get into discussions on &quot;born evil&quot; if you'd like, but I'd be really damned impressed if you can show empirically that someone was &quot;born bad&quot; and that their environment had zero influence on this.<br>
<br>
As a parent, you are directly responsible for the experience/nurture portion of the equation throughout the absolutely core-importance formative years prior to the child entering the education system. The values and behaviours that you instill as a parent in your toddler will stand them well or ill for the rest of their lives.<br>
<br>
The idea here is that you cannot build a great house on a crap foundation. Does a bad foundation ensure a bad house? No, but it certainly makes it a probability. The converse is equally true, as a good foundation does not guarantee a good house, though it does help.<br>
<br>
Once the child is out of the formative years, you are still the primary person responsible for their nurture and socialization, though you may share active duties with the rest of the folk the child comes into contact with. Still, all in all, you are the single most respected opinion in the child's life. The average child, while listening to their friends heavily, will admit that their parents are still an enormous influence on their lives, regardless of age.<br>
<br>
As time goes on, a parent has declining influence on the child's lifestyle choices, admittedly. This does not however absolve said parent of blame or responsibility though, as the parent still has the obligation to do everything they can to insure that the child/teen is not getting into trouble, preventable or not. At this stag in the child's existence, they are making more of their own choices and referencing your opinion less.<br>
<br>
The important point here is that, if you done your job laying the proper foundation, the child will have so much better an ability to make proper choices. Instill good values and morals, and teach the child to think through things reasonably, and you've done well to discharge your obligations as a parent. Teach no values or negative values, ignore morals, and fail to teach reasonable decision making and you have failed to adequately discharge your responsibilities.<br>
<br>
Look at yourself objectively, distance yourself from some of the emotions surrounding this, and give your parents some thought. They are more responsible for who and what you are than you might give them credit for.<br>
<br>
And, again, in the end of the argument, your parents inflicted you upon the world. It's their fault =) <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

Just make it so that the parents share the culpability (and eventually the verdict) of the ones who perpetrate such heinous crimes.  Then you'd see some SERIOUS ass-whuppings become more in vogue.  <br>
<br>
Today, kids are sueing their parents if the parents hit them.  That's BS.  Wanna see someone throw down a beating on a kid who's done something severely wrong?  Watch me.  I'll televise that beating on the web.  I'm 6'3&quot;, 260lbs and meaner than fiery hell when I get angry.  It takes a lot to piss me off, but when I do.. I'll go all Bruce Banner on your butt.<br>
<br>
Make the parents responsible and we'll see a huge wave of far better-behaved kids growing up in the next generation.<br>

As a kid (pre-teen) I leaned by fearing the belt more than I did by understanding any moral crap that my parents tried to instill.<br>
<br>
Heck, my first religious experiences were at the foot of my bed, pray that mom would get amnesia before dad got home.<br>
<br>
Once I got into my teens, I came to understand the moral concepts... but it was a healthy fear of a good old fashioned pants-droppin-arse-tanning that made me be good early on.<br>

Without discipline, there is chaos.  KIds need to learn at an early age that there are consequences for doing things wrong... just as much as there are for doing things right <p><center>

ROFL, I never grew up fearing any belt or anything like that... My parents never hit me and I think I'm fine.  I never got in too much trouble (well, no more than the average kid ;p) and again, I grew up fine.<br>
<br>
What you basically said was that kids should live with a &quot;healthy fear&quot; of getting hit if they do something wrong.  Well sir I'm sorry to say that there are other more civilized ways that are just &quot;as healthy&quot;.  I'm not bashing you or your parents or anything for the ways in which you were raised, im simply stating that theres ALWAYS another way that produces at least equal results. <p><center><map name="SigMap">

Mont.  There are ways to enstill permanent morals and social guidelines in a child's mind.  Giving them a &quot;time-out&quot; for a felony-type of crime is NOT going to act as a punishment.  The problem with people NOT hitting their kids is that the kids don't fear anything anymore.  If they get in trouble, the parents raise their voices and give them some menial politically correct punishment.  So what?  Getting grounded these days means you get to stay in your room and play computer games all day long.  Or watch cable TV.  Or surf chat rooms on the Internet.  It's not punishment - its a slight discomfort to their social lives.   They will associate crime and punishment with not being able to watch &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; for a month.  Oh, my stars and garters.. what a travesty!!  <br>
<br>
When I see parents dealing with kids in a mall, I hear &quot;Billy, don't do that.. Billy, please stop... Billy, don't touch that... Billy, put that down.... Billy, come here... Billy, please come here... Billy, don't hit that little girl... Billy... Billy.. &quot;  Grrrr.<br>
<br>
I grind my teeth at stuff like that.  Give ME that little dipsh*t Billy for about 10 minutes.  The moment he hears his name called by his parents, trust me.. some cold sh*t will run down his spine as he freezes and waits for his parents' next command.  He WILL listen and he WILL obey.  That's what kids should do.  They must first learn how to behave before they learn how to misbehave.<br>
<br>
Then I'll take the parents aside and teach THEM how to &quot;negatively motivate&quot; when it is appropriate.  There's nothing wrong with a beating now and then, as long as it's justified.  And whoa be the fuking parent who tells ME that they disapprove of my hitting the child.  I LOVE getting those mutterances under their breath.... And they think that my hearing ain't perfect.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey pal.. shut yer fuking piehole.. if someone gave YOU a little beating now and again when YOU were young, then you'd have learned by now to mind your own damned business.&quot;  That usually shuts them up pretty good.  Usually, I'm not mean to strangers.. but I give a great &quot;hairy eyeball&quot; when it is warranted.  That usually conveys enough 'do not mess with me' meaning to leave any verbal abuse out of the picture.<br>
<br>
You say that you &quot;grew up fine&quot;.  I'm sure you did.  And I'm sure many of us did.  I grew up fine, too.  But I remember more than a few moments in my life when I swore to God that &quot;I'd never do THAT again!&quot;.  Here's an example from my youth.  As a young teen, I once started a forest fire.  I'm not lying.   It was a blaze about 15 or 20 feet high, encompassing about half an acre.  It was burning full force for at least 10 min before the firemen just barely got it under control.  All because me and my friends were messing with fireworks one dry July afternoon.<br>
<br>
Well... let me tell you.  I caught such a beating that night from my mother.  She was a large-framed Italian woman - so naturally her weapon of choice was &quot;the big wooden spoon&quot; (+2 dam to 1H blunt weapon skill, I think) used to make all those infamous pasta sauces.  Not the little one she used to taste test, but the big one.  The.  Big.  One.  The one that she used when she wanted to kill Volkswagons.<br>
<br>
She broke it over... my... head.  Without even working up a sweat, she broke it over my head.  Try and break a wooden ANYTHING over your head.  Trust me.. it hurt so much my sister was even crying.  I saw spots for an hour.<br>
<br>
Moral to the story: I never - NEVER - messed with fireworks again.  Ever.  I still get headaches when I watch fireworks at the pier.<br>
<br>
Somethings, you take with you to your grave because your parents taught you to do things right.  It was their job and they did it well.<br>

Monty, when you mention hitting, I think that term needs to be clarified a wee bit.  PLease note that I am whole-heartedly against beatings per se (where limbs get broken, eyes get blackened, etc).<br>
<br>
Though I DO fully support bending yer kid over your knee and spanking the living hell out of them.<br>
<br>
Also note that I dont feel that you should ever hit a child out of anger.... but rather explain to them what they did wrong, and why it was wrong... and then start the punishment. <br>

<br>
It sounds to me like you guys have no clue the topic of this thread.  This kid was in high school... I dunno about you but by the time I was in high school I was like a foot taller than my mom~  nothing she could possibly do (if she had a reason to hit me, which she didnt) woulda even phased me.<br>
<br>
This kid was a teenager, you cant bend a teenager over your knee... and if this kid was a Senior (Assuming age 18+) you couldnt even do it legally.<br>
<br>
You all go on and on and on about spanking and hitting and beating when this doesnt, or probably doesnt, even apply to this circumstance.<br>
<br>
------<br>
And if your mom/dad did still bend you over their knee when you were in high school... well, I just find that very funny. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uaidiene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidiene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hot woodelf</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/6/02 2:35:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=301.topic&index=81>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OT- Another School Shooting</span><hr size=1> I think the point was...did his mom actually parent him when he was little...the assumption being that she did not or he would not have turned out like he did. I believe this is true most of the time. What you do... what you teach your child when they are small is what dictates what they do when they are older. I teach 14 year olds. It is obvious when you meet the parents which parents parented and which didn't and still don't. 9 out of 10 times I can tell you that by the way a student acts long before I meet their parents. The teenager that was brought up well as a child is rarely the teenager who gets into trouble with the school authorities and the law. Every year, in every group of 8th graders we get at least one parent who basically spoiled...let run...their child and now all of a sudden does not know what to do with this teenager who is in trouble all the time...we all want to say, &quot;well, duh..did you think he would raise himself??? stupid woman (man)&quot;. <br>
<br>
I have read a lot of this thread, and skipped a lot too...but I would have to say that spanking has its place in discipline for some children and some situations and saying you just don't believe in spanking, if you have a child with the right personality, could lead to disaster. Most children, the ones who respond to spanking, who are not spanked will only turn out to be spoiled brats. THen there are those who will be kicked out for writing death threats in their journals. We get one a year. <br>
<br>
I am lucky so far and my daughter responds well to a dissaproving look and telling her she isn't being nice. She wants more than anything to be nice. She is four. Do I think this will always work? No, not likely. Do I think this is the only way to discipline her? Not at all. If she does something that might hurt her or something more serious than saying something mean to her cousin, she deserves more discipline. The trick is to match the discipline to the action...and the discipline to your child's personality (if it doesn't bother them it isn't discipline...to realize that it is your JOB to raise these kids even when it is not convenient or fun. ESPECIALLY when it is not convenient or fun, for this is when your child is learning the most.<br>
<br>
If you do your job when your children are little, most likely it won't be your child suspended for threatening teachers or other students, it won't be your child arrested for taking a gun to school, it won't be your child dead from a gunshot wound to the head after killing students and teachers at school. <br>

Do you know? If you're going to assert that hitting is the way to keep kids from doing this stuff, don't you think that's kind of an important detail? Any argument for discipline being a factor in these (teenage) children's criminal behavior is going to need some evidence other than &quot;such and such worked on me, look how I turned out&quot; or &quot;I do this to my kids, blah blah.&quot; That's anecdotal evidence, and it doesn't hold up. The fact is, by claiming to know the answers, all we're doing here is making huge assumptions that may not even have any sort of relevance to the issue. If we found that school shooters were by and large spanked as children, would that change anything? Honestly, we don't have the answers, and the answers are probably a lot more complicated than we'd like them to be, and sweeping generalizations (especially unfounded ones) just don't seem to lead to much of anything.<br>

What's going on here is a healthy conversation being enjoyed by both participants and onlookers alike.  No, we're not the all-knowing, omnipotent beings who can deem something &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; at the drop of a hat... we're just offering to each other our own opinions of the topic.  And as everyone knows, opinions are never wrong.<br>
<br>
And getting back to the topic-at-large, Trab.. I think it's safe to assume that parental guidance (be it either passive or aggressive) is critical in forming ANY child's sense of morality.  A lack of it allows for too much of a course deviation from the rest of the civilized herd - the child's sense of right and wrong could be horribly and possibly dangerously skewed.<br>

------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Of course. But there is a strong sentiment here of &quot;all these kids need is a good whooping,&quot; which is really hard to get behind. Parents obviously have a huge role in their children's lives, that can't be denied. What I can't agree with is that there is some magical sort of &quot;right way&quot; and &quot;wrong way&quot; to raise your children. That school violence can be attributed 100% to &quot;wrong&quot; parenting. Children grow up in crack houses and turn out ok. Kids that have the perfect parents turn out messed up. Some kids are psychologically messed up in ways that aren't anybody's &quot;fault.&quot; Kids are resilient enough to where small variations in parenting methods are not going to result in a completely corrupted set of morals. If you look at things across cultures, we don't all raise children the same way. Some cultures are much stricter, some are much looser, but we don't see a culture of axe murderers out there because the kids were raised a certain way. I tend to think that unless you outright abuse your children, your kids are probably going to turn out decent. Not to say that parents aren't influential, they are, but children, by nature, are highly adaptive.<br>
<br>
Although school violence is highly publicized, the majority of children don't commit violent crimes. There are far more normal children out there than there are killers, far too many for &quot;lack of discipline&quot; to be a reasonable answer. I would be interested to see case studies on these children and see what kind of homes they were raised in, but I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't any obvious answers to be found in the parenting, something you could point to and say &quot;oh, well there's where they went wrong,&quot; unless it was a case of obvious abuse (not talking spankings here. I think there are more effective ways of raising children, but I'm talking about heavy beatings, verbal abuse, sexual abuse, the kind of stuff that is severely damaging to a child's psyche). Thinking otherwise may make us feel better about how we raise our children, make us feel a certain sense of security, but in the end parents who raise their children in the best possible way still sometimes end up with the worst possible outcome. <br>
