Btw just realized it was M.E. who was saying that smaller guild thing.  My apologies Esmalyn... my ignorance shows its face 0.o<br>

It &quot;might&quot; have been a problem with the system, BUT the GMs did poof our mob that we were 2 minutes from encountering... so if anything they were paying us for our time we spent there that night and the HOURS AND HOURS we've tried and practiced and worked on emp with our force of 40-60.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

First off it was your choice to pursue emperor that day.  Anyone who is even faintly aware of the rotation knows that Vis has never engaged blood before 10pm est, ever.  But looky here.... word is spreading around the servers that someone killed emp in under 6 minutes... word is also spreading around that they are /killing emp on some servers.  I'm sure that Vis moving to insignias at 7pm est had absolutely nothing to do with this whatsoever.  In any case anyone with half a brain should know that it was very possible for GM intervention before you reached your intended target and you chose to move on anyways.  You don't 'deserve' a rift for wasting your time because you took a gamble and lost.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Thought the Emp didn't get engaged that time, everyone in this post is a liar if they say they wouldn't have wanted that rift to get those 12 OTHER FREAKING pieces out of their bank.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you're so impatient to clear out bank space you could always combine the 10 shards to form the unadorned sceptre.  This combine doesn't require the emp rift and saves you 10 bank slots so I call bullshit on this pitiful attempt at making an excuse to justify their actions.  I would also like to state that I personally wouldn't have looted this piece given the same opportunity.  People may call me a shit stirrer blah blah blah but I wouldn't stoop to this level in game.<br>
<br>
In any case the most amusing part is this whole sitaution could have been avoided if the Vis members in question had been intelligent about it.  Instead the first thing one did was run to VT and ooc something while an LC raid was taking place.  Major points for that one there... not a soul outside Vis would have known if someone had been smart enough to keep their mouth shut. =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uzeik2001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeik2001</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>I like pie :D</span><br>  Posts: 178<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/20/02 4:28:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=183>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: deserved?</span><hr size=1> HAIL, A DEAD HORSE!

I don't blame Getcha for training.. it was an eye for an eye.  We dont do it on a regular basis, and we certainly play fair when our copmetiters play fair as well.  What were we supposed to do, sit back and let them have KT after our pullers got him single? Wait for a GM to show up and say &quot;Sorry we can't do anything b/c our serivce sucks, reports give no useful info that we can use(even tho we suggest using it and use it reports as an excuse NOT to help people), and we're to lazy to look at any logs!&quot;.<br>

No I wouldnt have looted those rifts.  I was brought up to play games fairly and not to cheat.  Cheating just takes the fun out of playing a game.  Thats why I never use cheat codes in any games until I have beat it first the way it was meant to be done.  Since EQ you never win I'll never be cheating.  Hell, i remember finding the forage and sell back bug in RV way back and petitioning and reporting it and not taking advantage of it like I could have.  To me, cheating takes al the enjoyment out of a game.<br>
<br>
So please quit trying to put your personal morals and ethics (or lack thereof) on me and everyone else.  You dont know me and had no idea what I would do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 548<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/20/02 4:49:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=186>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One man's words.</span><hr size=1> &quot;So, I vote that we move forward, and arrange marriage plans for Sephrok and Esmalyn.&quot;<br>

Cry a river for me, really. &quot;We were forced to train/ks/ninja loot.&quot; While a pile of bullshit. Just like we forced you to leapfrog us in HoT. Shit, you have it made as long as you keep looking through that telescope. You don't even realize that it's idiot statements like the one above that paves the way for other assholes to whine &quot;But we had not choice but to KS!&quot; <br>

<br>
Trying to take back or talk around training so soon already? Or do you think I'm fibbing when I say I was there? I found out, through the raid channel, that Wraith was there after half the people ported out. We moved to near the arena entrance and were told to back up to give Droz room to work when we found out RiP wasn't successful on their own and squeezed into the passageway. Out comes KT with a file of giants...and back he goes. Out he comes, and back he goes. After watching the procession for half an hour or more, we decide we're taking a shot. Alu pulls from the throne (thx bind sight), probably with Ayer's help. At worst you can say we leapfrogged you. (Hey! Does that word ring a bell?)<br>
<br>
You gave us what, 5-10 minutes before you opened the door and jumped Dozer? And what did we give you, half an hour and you still couldn't pull your shit together with the combined &quot;talents&quot; of three guilds? Ahh, but we forced you to train us. Why didn't we think of that in HoT? Oh yeah, we're not douche bags like you. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 10/20/02 5:32:36 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uzupe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zupe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Port Bitch Extraordinaire</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/20/02 5:32:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=188>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://keele.wwm.net/images/coolfrog.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One man's words.</span><hr size=1> LOL, you two are such liars.

I was. As Seph stated, RIP/Alliance folks started arriving at about the same time, we moved into HoT when we got about 20 people, and Alliance had about 12 when we did.  Someone mysteriously opened the HoT Door and trained us, we rez back and theres 20 Alliance people in HoT buffing now...Seph  asks if Alliance wants to either work together or /roll...he gets ignored, Alliance pulls, somone opens door again, we both whipe.  At this point we CR for a second time, buff and engage Doze.<br>
<br>
Personally I think the whole situation sucked, but the fact remains that WE in fact had a sufficient force first before Alliance did, and were trained purposely *cough* Mosa *cough*in efforts to stall us, then after repeated attempts to try to work out the situation between the two guilds, we were ignored.<br>
<br>
We were playing by the rules, by all rights, after we moved into HoT with our suffiecent force, Alliance should have backed off, if anything it was Alliance folks that tried to leapfrog us, and the whole training thing, yeah thats playing by the rules (I wasn't really paying attention, but I assume Mosa is in the Alliance or with them or whatever) We tried to come to an agreement and were ignored...what else where we supposed to do? Back off? we both got there at the same time, and we had more people (20 vs 12) Lemme ask, if RIP had the 12 people and you all had 20, would you have backed off?<br>

You guilded Esmalyn? (assuming explicit)<br>
<br>
Mosa trained numerous times whether you like it or not(at doze &amp; 8th shawl war).. so dont give me that bullshit.<br>
<br>
EDIT: No, i didnt say Getcha was forced to train... it's called eye for an eye. And if you are actualy in explicit (i dont know?) you'd know that they even support / expected getting trained, it is, quote, &quot;a part of the game&quot; -From some Explicit member that i dont remember the name of.<br>
<br>
 What happened in Kael was completely wrong on so many levels from all sides, but it could ahve been avoided if Explicit didnt walk in on an agreement between RIP &amp; Wraith. (The agreement being Wraith was gonna go do vindi while RIP tried KT for the first time, if we failed they were taking KT)<br>
<br>
EDIT2: And what do you mean we weren't succesful with our chance at KT? We didn't engage him until after Explicit whiped after taking our pull.  (then he was gated by Linaren =P). <p><center>

No Montyy, I’m making shit up as I go. Of course I was there, you dullard.<br>

<br>
I’m not going to rehash that thread and go over what I saw in the raid channel and group chat as to Mosa’s intentions. If you want to take a closer look on your message board, feel free to and bring it up here. Nor will I comment on the Oioio’s shawl because I was not there, I can’t vouch for it either way.<br>
<br>
Although, it’s kind of funny Seph. If we, or at least Mosa, didn’t care about intentionally training you, why didn’t Mosa do it during the fight when you were most vulnerable and when it would have benefited us the most?<br>
<br>
“You guilded Esmalyn? (assuming explicit)”<br>
-- Seph<br>
<br>
No…<br>
<br>
“We tried to come to an agreement and were ignored...what else where we supposed to do? Back off? we both got there at the same time, and we had more people (20 vs 12) Lemme ask, if RIP had the 12 people and you all had 20, would you have backed off?”<br>
-- Montyy<br>
<br>
Sorry Mont. I saw around the same number of people, and we regularly invited others to HoT, guilded or not, like myself. And you (meaning Seph), wasn’t ignored. It was more like a unanimous “Hell no” when Sen asked us what we thought. <br>
<br>
“Get over it.”<br>

With your permission. ::eyeroll:: <br>
<br>
&quot;And if you are actualy in explicit (i dont know?) you'd know that they even support / expected getting trained it is, quote, &quot;a part of the game&quot; -From some Explicit member that i dont remember the name of.&quot;<br>

<br>
Oh gawd. Are you taking that from a thread here where people complained about trains and that anonymous druid went off on uber guilds? Weak come back, man. Being trained <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> part of the game, it's sometimes unavoidable. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Intentionally training</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is unnecessary, no matter who snags your precious mob.<br>

<br>
What a cute euphemism. Why didn't you direct the &quot;pull&quot; of twenty some odd giants into your camp?<br>
<br>
So…tell us again why it’s okay to train in your case, Seph? We have to make certain future trainers are able to avoid immoral pitfalls as effectively as you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usephrokdapathfinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sephrok da Pathfinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Da Pathfinder</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/20/02 6:56:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=192>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: One man's words.</span><hr size=1> Eye for an eye. <p><center>

<br>
In my small corner of the world I see those that took advantage of this situation is the same light of those that multi-quest or twink.  Of course there are two big differences.  First, I don't see as how those that got their keys are going to benefit until their guild kills Emperor anyway and gets a keyed force large enought to do anything.  So they haven't benefited as much by going against the 'vision' as they would have by multi-questing or twinking.<br>
<br>
The second big difference is this opens up a whole can o' worms for guilds to restart up a pissing match.  I think this is why most of this thread has nothing to do with the original post ...<br>
