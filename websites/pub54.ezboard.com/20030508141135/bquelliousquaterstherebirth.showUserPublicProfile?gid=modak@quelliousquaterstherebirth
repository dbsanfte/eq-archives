Not even Modak himself!  It is commonly believed that Modak was born in Felwithe the son of a wealthy high-elf jeweler.  Sages and mystics speculate that the birth of Modak occurred eons ago, for Modak is fluent in Elder Dragon, the very language of magic itself.
 
Modak has always had the ability to change shape, although he did not master this ability until much later in life.  As an infant, these changes, although small, were often spontaneous.  

At an early age, Modak accompanied his father to Kelethin on business.  It is rumored that Modak shape-shifted into an inanimate object, such as a torch, a chair, or a bed.  His father searched frantically for him, but could never again find his lost son.  After all, the Wood Elf city, high above the forest floor of Greater Faydark, was designed to be disorienting.  

Modak was lost at such an early age, that he has no recollection of his parents.  As an orphan, he lived among the Wood Elves in Kelethin, often in the form of a Half-Elf, or Wood Elf.  One day, he was nearly killed by the city guards after shifting into the form of a Dark Elf.  

Having never seen a Dark Elf, Modak was terribly frightened by the experience.  Driven equally by fear and curiosity, he left Kelethin to roam Norrath.

Just as Modak thought he had control of his shape shifting abilities, he would take on a new form.  As he grew older, these changes became more and more impressive.  Races similar in size and shape to Elves were easiest at first, including Humans and Erudites.  As the years passed, Modak also mastered the forms of Gnomes, Dwarves, and Halflings.  Larger races such as Ogres and Trolls, and even trees followed.  Then came the forms of the very elements themselves, Earth, Air, Water and Fire.  The sages believe that Modak is a lycanthrope, and that his awesome shape-shifting powers are the result of a werewolf bite as an infant.  Some claim to have seen Modak in the form of a werewolf!

As Modak’s powers grew, so did his fame in Norrath.  His company was highly sought after by adventurers.  The mere presence of Modak created small tears in the fabric of reality.  These small tears could stop time, often drastically altering the outcome of battle.  Larger tears had much greater effects, as the matter and energy of one reality poured into the next.  It is rumored that the continent of Kunark appeared with the birth of Modak, and that the discovery of Luclin coincides with his death.  

Modak was violently dismembered by Drolvargs in Karnor’s Castle.  No one but Modak knows what he experienced in death.  It is speculated that without a body, he was free to explore the ultimate reality of the universe.  Astonishingly, Modak returned to his body several months after his death; taking the surname Kadom to signify his eternal recurrence.

Those who adventure with Modak may have done so many times before without knowing him, for his forms are many.  They may hear him scream in Elder Dragon if he is wounded deeply.  But most interestingly, they will experience the rending of space and time itself in his presence.  Foes will wait patiently to die, alone and unaided by their comrades as time stops only for them.  And strangely, foes long since vanquished may reappear suddenly, only to be vanquished again.
