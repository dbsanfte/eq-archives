You don't Zerg the Ring of Vulak. You don't Zerg pre-patch emp. Hell, you don't Zerg Shei. It is simply not possible. All of these encounters are all about tactics.<br>

I think what you are trying to say is we have a lot of people, and that is true. Having a lot of people does not mean we do what I stated in the first paragraph. Please use the correct term next time.<br>

<br>
Woow, do you really think if this was the way it went down and Wraith/Reviv circumvented a GM decision that we wouldn't get into some sort of trouble? Guilds have been banned for these type of actions.<br>
<br>
And as far as us having more people at our raids than you do, its because Wraith and Reviviscence are not elitist. I am far from uber. I joined when I was level 58, no AA points, nothing above average about me in regards to gear, only Sebilis and Howling Stones keys on my ring. People are chosen for their quality of personality, knowledge of their class and the ability and desire to work together as a team and have fun. <br>
<br>
The guild you describe is not the one I am guilded into. I would like to think that most people know what kind of person I am, and I would not be a part of an organization that is as you describe it. One night we were in Srra, poised to raid something in there, HP or Blood or something and RiP was already there. Rather than allow them to wipe when it was at 5 percent, a crew was sent in to help them finish off the job. We could have waited for them to wipe and then take the mob ourselves. Its allowable in &quot;the rules&quot;, but we didn't. Help has been offered to more people, not always accepted, but offered nonetheless. Sure sounds like a guild that runs over people to me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> further? o yeah..gaining access to the uber zone 1 week before next expansion is going soooo far. o well..guess i should gratz you on access to lag and train LC and able to slow them down.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I would like to think that we have a pretty good relationship with LC. They we our biggest cheerleaders when we killed the Emperor. We have a blast when we all mess around in the arena with each other. There is mutual respect there, regardless of the silly mud flinging here. There is no reason for them, you or anyone to think that we would abuse LC upon our entry into VT. It is offensive for you to even mention it.<br>
<br>
As for your threats...beware what you say in anger, for the people you screw over in devious ways due to a childish tantrum such as yours always get their just reward. If you make good on these petty threats, I am sure you and whoever is involved will find yourself screwed as well, through the proper channels and we have your written threats as proof of premeditation. <br>
<br>
For those who are counting, thus far Woow has said the word &quot;zerg&quot; 15 times.<br>
<br>
Grow up.<br>

I used to be one of the people that thought, omg wraith zerg they suk lol~<br>
<br>
Then later, after we did Arch Lich ourselves, you really gotta think... how are you gonna zerg that? :P You can't really, all more people does is more DPS, makes it faster on that. If you go in there with no tactic, you will die, with 40 OR 90 people.<br>
<br>
Would I rather do a fight with 30-40 people? Yeah, I would, alot less lag. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
It's exactly because of what Explicit have done the last few weeks.... send a few ppl in to bust up the trigger cycle, then tell a full raid force to go away cuz your 3 groups is gonna kill cursed later.  It takes no more than 2 people to kill a taskmaster, 20 for glyphed, 30 for exiled... <br>
<br>
Most mobs you need a force to engage.. cursed you can tie up with almost nothing.. we know this and rather than get into trigger-races and such or avoid us all rushing 2 groups to basement to claim and counter claim, we rotate. <br>
<br>
When Wraith grew up and caught up with Vis/LC, we had some scuffles too.. we were killing &quot;their&quot; mobs... they didn't think we were capable yet or what not, there was friction.. the first thing we did and they did once we were obviously capable was put aside the bullshit and worked things out.  We *asked* to be in the ntov rotation, before we took any shots... after one cursed conflict with LC all  sides backed off and started talking and sharing in Ssra.<br>
<br>
This has been the defining difference with Explicit and the rest of the raiding guilds so far.. we get them rushing 18 ppl to whatever mob even when a full raid is there and blocking doors, tehn when we engage we get trained.  It's stupid.  If you guys want in on Cursed, just ask.<br>
<br>
What are the rest of us gonna do.. tell you &quot;no we don't want you to do cursed ever, we are rotating it, go away thanks?&quot;... If we do that we are ASKING to fight.  If we only give you the option to fight for it or go away, then obviously you are gonna fight.  WE don't want to fight, that's why we work things out with each other.<br>
<br>
You guys WANT to fight over cursed every week?  You guys WANT to fight over every mob in the game and shove Vis/LC/Wraith out of the way and dominate the server?  Keep going... dunno if you will succeed in that but if the last few days is your idea of fun you'll have a jolly time I'm sure.<br>
<br>
You guys are obviously filling up, you get 40ish tagged on many raids and still claim more recruits than tagged at raids.. you guys HAVE killed cursed so you obviously can... if you don't WANT to fight and train and leapfrog (which means it will happen back...duh) ... just say so.   Talk to me, Binedina, Darkoor, Biffins.. play with the server not against it.<br>
<br>
When wraith was moving up.. we'd get asked/told  &quot;well if you aren't the bad guys why do LC/Vis work together and you don't&quot;...  well every time we broke in to LC/Vis territory it got worked out and we got in with no more than one conflict... which generally stemmed around  us not being deemed capable of killing whatever mob it was.  Safe to say we are caught up with both of those guys and we powwow and work with each other fine.<br>
<br>
So let me ask you guys.... if you aren't the bad guys why do Vis/LC/Wraith (and Rel too where their raids cross over) work together but you don't?    A month from now are you gonna be at the table with everyone else, or are you  gonna be jumping others, training,  blowing triggers to delay other raids and trying to claim mobs with less than 20 people? <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

Some on way most in basement. We killed 3 taskmasters, wraith goes kills a rhozh(sp?). Biffins tells gms we didnt kill triggers he killed all 10.......yes in vis we always killed 7 tms and the warden, then moved up to do rhozh x 2. probably worked against this case. Dont feed me we didnt have enough b/c you know full well those 3 w/o ae's and less hps = 3-4 groups if that. (not to  mention we had these people in basement waiting while wraith was in creator). Kind of ashamed of actually endorsing a run on a gimped up cursed, wish the patch never happened. To call a rotation on that....rel has been on that cycle before why i not see them taking slack for this? If it's up and nobody is around why not take a shot.      <br>

today in ssra ...We both wanted HP...we had not near enough so who left who stayed and got kill? ...creator 2 guilds racing up and a gm forces a roll is what i assume was where the roll came from...is nothing new. Wraith people say to send tells...two way street. Think i will ever try again to talk to desi w/ attitude i got in basement? probably no. I rather just roll when a gm tells us. And sephrok people do stupid shit in heated moments. History of eq, will always happen. No guild on these mobs on the  server can lie and said NEVER did something wrong. I'll admit wrong moves, but i never see it returned. If we steal a pull, stealing one from us doesnt make it right. We were BOTH wrong. rationalizing is lame. If anything we have pretty much minded our business, save a few run-ins. to keep this thread on ssra/cursed is stupid just end it. We all have fucked up with decisions and im sure we all will in future. <br>

We'd support them if we were &quot;let&quot; into them... but we're given no choice but to disrespect the rotations.  The &quot;it's our turn in the rotation&quot; is no excuse to steamroll someone when we'd willingly participate / respect the rotation.<br>

The point is, it is really sad that those 8 people from Vis Maior looted that rifts. I mean what were they thinking?? Yeah verants CS sucks, but come on, you think they'll let you get away with that? looting those rifts was exploiting. those mobs that drop the rifts only spawned because a GM /killed the emp.<br>

too bad the GM doesnt know how to count, eh? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=129409">Velsharen</a> <BR>

<br>
I don't know what happened. I don't really care as none of it is of any consequence to me at all anymore, but in my dealings with waif in the past, both the present incarnation and the previous one (which by the way are pretty fucking similar) is that they are really diplomatic and nice when it's apparent that the people they are dealing with have some advantage over them, but when they feel superior you might as well be dog shit to them.  I've been on a couple explicit raids where I've seen this happen.  I experienced it long ago when waif was superior to Lotus Cult and I was a member of LC.  It's never been a secret that I don't like wraith.  I'm not a big fan of explicit anymore either to be perfectly honest, but I do believe that those things that people do are what makes their character and those of us that have been around long enough know the character of those that wear the &lt;Waif&gt; above their heads. <br>
<br>
The whole thing is I'd have a hell of a lot more respect for Waif if they'd just come clean and stop lying about everything.  Many times I don't know the facts about what happened, but every time I come here and read something that I DO know the facts about, I find that 90% of the time they have been distorted by some waif fuckwad.  Because of that I find it hard to place any credence in anything I read or am told by anyone in waif.  But that's just my opinion.  I could be wrong. <p>Gimily Smashfist 60th Cleric (retired)<BR>Gimilly Smashfist 60th Warrior</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwarlordette.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Warlordette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>F Salta!!!</span><br>  Posts: 207<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/18/02 9:29:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WTB planar rifts</span><hr size=1> Vis Maior was prepping for Emp on Wednesday Evening.

The GM killed all but one Shissar Wraith, wich dropped 8 planar rifts.  8 VM folks looted the planar rifts and im guessing completed their VT Keys.<br>
<br>
So basically VM got rifts without killing the Emperor.  Not much they can do in VT with 8 people, but the principle of it still sucks for those that worked their asses off to get rifts...<br>
