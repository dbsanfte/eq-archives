<br>
As far as the whiners who gripe about posts being hijacked, get over it. It takes far less effort to post something to get it back on track than to bitch about starting a new thread. We have all done it to some extent, but the imprtant threads, unlike those that are just nonsensical flaming, usually make it back on track if anyone really cares enough to bother.<br>
<br>
I too am a conservative, and could give a @#%$ if anyone cares or not. I will continue to speak out when things are unfair, or if I have a really strong opinion. I find it a shame that a nice person such as Jynn felt the need to leave, but we all have to decide if we can be a part of this particular board community or not. I choose to stay as I enjoy the people here. Some impress me one day, and make me want to rip the power cord from my monitor the next.<br>
<br>
We will not all agree all the time on all things, and I hope that you may come back someday to visit us again Jynn.<br>

<br>
It certainly is.  A game with real people sitting behind the characters.  This board goes a little beyond game, and gets more into the personal aspect of personalities.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Dahlea. Be warned. I'm going to turn on you next! (Great way to start an explanation, J.)&quot;<br>
<br>
Rofl  Oops.  Well, I think Dahlea can probably handle that.  I just prefer her not taking undue heat on my account.  Yes, I realize you were joking. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
&quot;I suppose the person relaying this message was part of the oppressed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ummm, no, actually it was not one of the oppressed, but I will it up to them as to whether they feel like speaking up.<br>
<br>
&quot;The reason you rub others the wrong way is you're one of the few conservatives (or moderate conservative) in a liberal crowd.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is most likely very true.  I have had some violent blood lettings on the Writer's Forum and yet we've all survived and remain staunch friends.<br>
<br>
&quot;Could you *possibly* say anything more to paint regulars as fiends?&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Nope, that was as violent as I could get without being lewd, crude or otherwise socially unacceptable.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wait, wait, wait!<br>
<br>
Get out of here Jynn!&quot;<br>
<br>
Gosh, that is such a tempting invitation to stay. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
&quot;Jynn, it sounds like you're taking up others' causes, entrenching yourself in their shoes. Appreciating how others feel is commendable but you (generic) can go too far.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, the reason for posting those two examples is so that people would not think that all I notice is &quot;me&quot; and point out that there is a pattern of jumping on really trivial things at times and it's not always trivial things that I do.  I understood the gist of his message, but apparently it was difficult for others.  The reason I didn't thank Barto for the invitation or say goodbye was I was a little weary at that point and didn't feel like opening another battlefront.<br>
<br>
&quot;BTW, I think I read the post here. It should be moved to the general forum. Oh sh*t, I'm being mean again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope, not at all.  Actually, I think this is the proper place because it will turn into a flame session and that saves someone else from having to move it later.  FWIW  I may not always agree with your point of view, but you at least set forth an intelligent and articulate one as opposed to a string of personal x-rated attacks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Youve only posted for a few days, it takes much longer for people to get to know you and truly appreciate hating you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rofl  And here I thought I could truly inspire blind hatred in just a few days.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well said, in fact I think this has been the problem for me since the beginning.  <br>
Your posts seem to have revolved around you personally, so when people reply you take it personally.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've responded to several things, but I suppose those are the ones that stick in your memory just as some people who have posted things that get in my craw and later post something intelligent or intersting.  You tend to remember the things that irk you, don't you think?  Why do you think there are so many irritating commercials on tv?<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm a fairly blatant Libertarian/Conservative as well, and catch hell for my opinions.&quot;<br>
<br>
Arrrrrgh.  No, I live with one of those. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
To be honest, I probably have let some things bother me that I shouldn't have and only about half of them had to do with me.  I've been in a funk, and tend to let things get to me at times. <br>
<br>
&quot;It likely will not be worth the effort if you are not taking some sort of enjoyment from the bantering and bickering as it is though.&quot;<br>
<br>
I actually quite enjoy a lively round of bickering and bantering as Drizzat and Healers will attest, I just kind of cringe when it gets to the torturing part.  I should even be used to that between Drizzat, Aeryss and Dahlea. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
&quot;Ugh. So go. Why all the drama?&quot;<br>
<br>
The better to torture you with, my dear.  Oh, fire.  Holy knight has been hanging around dark elves too long and is now enjoying torture.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry to see you go Jynn, and I am glad I got a chance to see your writing before you did.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thank you.  I count you as one of my new friends.  You remind me much of Snowbyrd.  Your personality suits your character well.<br>
<br>
I'll probably be posting some short stories on the Vinceremo board later.  I will take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in The Bard.  It started out as an introduction of Mynxx to Vinceremo and turned into a story.  Several people have encouraged me with the story so it is now being rewritten into a real novel sans the EQ aspects.  I can't finish the murder mystery until I go to Louisiana for some research, so this will be a pleasant diversion.  My sincere gratitude to you and the others for making me want to delve a little deeper into the fantasy.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Some impress me one day, and make me want to rip the power cord from my monitor the next.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hmmm.  I know the feeling.  In reality, I find quite a few of the people here quite interesting.  There are some very witty people here.  I enjoy most of the things Sem passes along.  There are some intriguing personalities here.  <br>
<br>
&quot;They didnt slam her for having an opinion, they slamed her opinion.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't care if anyone slams me or my opinion.  What I do have an objection to is the attitude of some who feel they have to look for something to slam about whether it be opinion or person regardless of who it is. <br>
<br>
Be well all.  There's nothing to see.  Let's move along.  *Puts up police tape and closes the scene of the crime.*<br>
