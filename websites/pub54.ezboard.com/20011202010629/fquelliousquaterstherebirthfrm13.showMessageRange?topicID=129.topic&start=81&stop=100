<br>
Quas, when I was 19, I was in the military, (Army), I was serving a 3 year stint in Europe, was married with a kid on the way.  My daughter is 15 years old now and displays more maturity, and intelligence than Rainwynds does.  She knows how to write well, add, subtract and express ideas in a clear concise manner.  She is one of the few kids I know that actually values her education.  And these are not just the words of a proud father.  She is already taking college courses as a freshman in high-school.  I have a Bachelors Degree myself in Accounting and some of the stuff she brings home boggles my mind.<br>
<br>
Goldmund, I do not wish I was never guilded with him, but I am ashamed that he was a member of MC.  His constant diatribe brings shame to the MC name, and to myself for being associated with such drivel as he.  But in any case, it is good to hear from you again.  You have been missed.<br>
<br>
Minelwood, it is good to see you again man.  Been too long.  Hell guys if we keep this up, we might just get every old member of MC to show up and flame Rain en-masse.  Be just like old times.  Heh.<br>

My daughter lives with her mother in Florida and visits me whenever I can afford to bring her up to Alaska, (usually once a year for 4-8 weeks).  She is with her mother simply because I was not mature enough at the age of 25, nor did I have the money to afford a lawyer to fight for custody of her and be a single father.  Her mother fell in love with another man one year after our divorce and re-married.  <br>
<br>
Our reasons for divorcing are really none of your affair, but for the sake of this flame I will admit that lack of communication and being WAY to young and immature on both our parts made our marriage fail.  10+ years of age and growing up since then has made me a much better communicator, and the relationship I have with my daughter shows it.<br>
<br>
If your parents saw this thread, which I hightly doubt in any case, then unless they do not understand English, I am sure they were just as dismayed by your poor writing skills as anything else.  I hope they do not spend too much money on furthering your education, because it will be a total waste, provided you can score high enough on your SAT's to get accepted into anything other than a non-accredited community college. <br>
<br>
Oh and Montyy, I was in the Army a long time ago, and was never a fanatic about it.  But for the sake of standing up for my comrades in arms, BOO NAVY....GO ARMY!<br>

<br>
As I have gone through post after post, I have had mixed feelings going back and forth. I even started to feel sorry for the personal abuse everyone is heaping on Rain. Then I thought back to page 1 and 2 that I haven't viewed in a day or two, and HE started it. Well, no matter who started it, it is starting to make everyone look petty and immature. I am unsure why I am still reading this drivel, but I felt compelled to post anyway.<br>
<br>
Rain, I understand how angry you could be at whoever you have had problems with in game and on these boards, but to sink down to a childish level and call people names was your downfall and probably the only reason this has gone so far. Understandably, you are still young, but if you are as intelligent as you say, and I have no reason to doubt it, you should have controlled yourself and stuck to more intellectual arguments. Another person we all know is the same age as you and lacks that same control over her emotions. Its a part of maturing. I have no personal reason to dislike you, and I still don't, I just think you have made mistakes that are now hard to recover from, and you have personally attacked many people using nasty, base names that have no part in effective defense of yourself. You handled it badly, and its unfortunate.<br>
<br>
To everyone else, on the flip side of this, I am shocked at how nasty you all have gotten. I expect better than personal attacks against someone's grammar. Granted, he should take more care in his type, and he got personal and nasty first, but I have read bad posts before, and no one has really made an issue of punctuation and grammar. No one here is perfect, least of all myself, and all of you have perpetuated this nasty business nearly as much as Rain has. Where are the well thought out posts I have come to expect from the majority of the folks that post here? We have been reduced to kindergarten antics and name calling. <br>
<br>
I suggest that either this topic be ended, or at least someone put something constructive when they hit the reply button. I respect most people on this board and I actually have come to appreciate the quality of the flames. I am sadly disappointed in this one, as it has become petty and cruel, from one side, and then the other. I fully expect a snide comment or two about my reply, but I speak only what I have been thinking for the past three pages. Go ahead and flame me, I work at a refinery, I have NoMex coveralls. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

LOL man you really need some reading skills bad.  I already mentioned that I wasn't flaming your EQ ethics and game play. I don't know you in game so therefore it wouldn't be right for me to do that, no.  However, with the way you're exhibiting yourself here, anyone who attempts to read your indecipherable posts are free to form an opinion and comment on your behavior.  In your words, flame. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So I guess you're right.  I am flaming YOU as a human being, not as a EQ player.  But in the real world, that's called criticism. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
We're not flaming a 19 year old just because we're bullies and we think you're easy prey. No.  We're flaming YOU in particular after they way you've displayed your immaturity.  If I were you, I would consider this a free lesson in life and learn from it.<br>
<br>
And to tell me to shut my mouth? LOL the last time I heard that one was when I was baby sitting my 3 year old cousin. I playfully teased him, and he said that to me because he was frustrated that he couldn't win the argument.  Hmm...actually I do see a resemblance here.<br>
<br>
I find it humorous that you actually think you will win this argument.  Find me ONE just ONE person who posted on this thread that is actually on your side.  Even those who don't know you in game, who merely read this post for entertainment (like myself) are stepping forward and commenting on how disgusted they are with your behavior (again let me reiterate, your behavior on this board, NOT in game).  Heck your maturity has even been compared to prepubescent children! <p><CENTER>
