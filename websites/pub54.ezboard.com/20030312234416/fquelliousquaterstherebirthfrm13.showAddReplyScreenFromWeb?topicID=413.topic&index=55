<br>
I used to be in Asylum's Gate, and had met Opalmoon then.  After AG fell apart, Opalmoon offered me a home.  She had always been nice, and offered a rez whenever I would lag quadding wyverns and end up as their food.  I joined MK and really liked all the people.  Everyone was always willing to help someone out, give a port, rez, etc.  <br>
Arianwen is also a great person.  In the last week alone she had spent countless hours helping a wizard from our guild camp a dragon for Hsagra's Wrath in WW.  Was there anything for her directly to gain from this, no.  She was trying to make MK stronger by giving them a bane wizard.  <br>
<br>
Of course this is the flame boards, and things about people I never would have guessed are coming out.  After opal/avis left Mk, whenever I saw opal i would still /hug.  There were never any hard feelings or anything, because its a *game* and if Opalmoon wasn't enjoying the guildleader woes she has every right to leave.  A few things I don't like though...<br>
<br>
Avis you didn't have to make such generalizations about mk.  I think I know how to play my class pretty well, as well as many other mk people being uber nice and good players too.  I understand you and Arianwen had a conflict, yes, but if you want to discuss mk issues go to our ezboard.  wtf gives you the right to think you are more uber, or that you could pwn things we can't.  since you made the address against mk, as a member i take great offense to those remarks.  do i think i could &quot;survive&quot; in an uber guild, yes, but rl takes too much time away from eq, and as much as i'd love to spend endless nights killing ubah mobs, i just don't have the time.  you mentioned greedy people in mk, well how about i got my epic without your help.  on the fear part i got help from dark brigade in fear, for VS a few manaburners were uber nice and owned vs for me, and for phinny, i did ask the guild a few times when i camped him a week straight, however i just had some people come a few times to help with the pickup raids i made.  <br>
as for miina, according to what's been posted here, i don't see what she did wrong.  when you cut your ties with mk opal, how was miina supposed to live under your rules still?   that'd be like being guildleader but not.  miina is always there for me when i need a rez, and always there to lend a hand to a guildy that needs.  making such a brazen remark against her on QC isn't right at all.<br>

<br>
Opal the problems between us are strictly of a personal nature.  And as such should be kept between us and not on a public forum.  Theres lots of peeps who know exactly what went on over two years ago between us, this crap doesnt need to be drug out over an open forum, and i find it ridiculous that your fumin over this same nonsense two years later ...get over it already.<br>
<br>
And as far as my joinin MK, ive often stated that id love to join on multiple occasions ...except that i know it wouldnt be possible as long as you were there because of our history.<br>
<br>
You are wrong in blamin miina for this ...several peeps wanted me back ...if you remember most of MK's oldest officers were my invites people ive been very good friends with over the years.  And no miina didnt start tryin to recruit me, once you had left ...i approached her ..not the other way around.  If youve a problem with someone ..its me not her.<br>
<br>
And has been stated, i waited almost 2 weeks to get in ..(longer than the normal wait) due simply because of the history between me and you (and you werent even in the guild at the time i was recruiting); whats the issue.<br>
<br>
Id hope youd cease the personal attacks now ..this is utterly stupid, and all over a disagreement that happened back in April of 2000; for crying out loud... move on.<br>

And bring out those stuff on a offical board? Most stuff posted here is a thing between you and the the guild you once lead or individuals once been people you been with for a long time.<br>
I think its just wrong to bring all this up defending yourself against a post Arianwen posted bash other ppl by the way as well and give them names and all and make Moonlite Knights looking the worst guild alike on the server.<br>
I never had a problem with all that stuff happened since i accepted (never understood) everyone need to find their own ways, but so far it been in good words, but this flaming here and all this bitching and rebitching isnt what a former guildleader should do to a bunch of people he went a long road with and he she has to thank a lot too. Arianwen is one person it wasnt really needed to bring all this up Opal and Avis really not. I thought better of you really then just to bring all this mud up on a offical board about stuff. Lots people took offense on this and it wasnt in any way needed. Im really sick of reading this and it isnt what i awaited really as your response since i thought of you better.<br>
<br>
Once you both been once of the main reasons i came to Moonlite Knights and i really cant see why you you posted all this here.<br>
<br>
We all three know the truth und untruth about what is posted here and i will gently leave it with it, like its posted here. Its really not worth to argue it really since you both made your decision, so just leave MK alone and dont offend and bash at the people there cause you left and decided to go a different way and someone from outside guild stated his personal mind on this offical board about you both. Thank You!<br>
<br>
Anyways i wish you luck with Wraith i know some good people there i went some long ways along and i hope you find your way there.<br>

Other than Thorwald, Anniod, Eddik and Nemglani  i havent spoken to anyone in MK for more than 2 seconds in 3 or 4 weeks to avoid BS like this.<br>
<br>
You wanna blame someone for dragging all this out; blame the drama queen, and her half truths and BS lies.<br>

MK isnt a bad guild and alot of the people are very nice people in MK.  But there are quite a few that are selfish and two-faced.  <br>

<br>
Try figuring out why most of your guild didn't bother to help you; nevermind take the time to respond to you, with your epic even though you were asking repeatedly in guild chat, like the day you did VS.<br>
<br>
But it comes down to the same BS you dont know all the crap that went on and probably wont, but still you insist on posting here as if you do...<br>
<br>
Basically i figure anyone that takes offense is pretty much defending people they do not know or i struck a nerve in how people were acting.  Either way look back on page one and see who dug it up cause i have been done with it for a month.<br>
<br>
P.S. if i am such an azzhole why would my opinion matter or mean enough to you to warrant a response?<br>
<br>
The only thing this is accomplishing is putting MK dirty laundry in the street.  People wanna do that its fine, but i would think it would be better for all involved to let it go...but if you wanna spend a dollar; i will be more than happy to give you my 2 cents change.<br>
