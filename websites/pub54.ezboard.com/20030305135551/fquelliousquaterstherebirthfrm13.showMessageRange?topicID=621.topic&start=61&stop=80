I rather not spend 30mins responding to your posts each day..<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Pretty clearly by your own words its not 'just likeing solitude' you refuse to group&quot;<br>
<br>
I refuse to group because I like the solitude.  I've grouped a few times in PoP.  Don't really care for it but its necessary to get parchments and the like.  I will change the statement.  I refuse to group on a continual basis.<br>
<br>
&quot;You loved manaburn and threw a fit when they changed it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rofl. I did?  I was angry about the mod rod nerf you fool.. Manaburn was in the back of my mind.  If you read my later posts I said it should be nerfed because there were too many wizards with it which make the farming worse.. It its earlier days it was fine.. In fact Verant disagrees because they still feel its fine for wizards to kill dragons.  Manaburn was nerfed because of PoP not Kunark dragons.  I can count many more wizards who manaburned dragons more than me.  I left a raid once to manaburn a dragon and that was when it was new.  I know other wizards faked logging and left to kill a dragon.<br>
<br>
&quot; it was pointed out that by definition thats an oxymoron.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually there are 2 definitions of greed.  <br>
<br>
&quot;excessive desire to acquire or possess more (esp material wealth) than one needs or deserves&quot;<br>
<br>
By this definition.  Anyone who has more than 2 weapons is greedy. Anyone who has backup gear is greedy.. Anyone who has gear on twinks is greedy.  Greed is generally used as a word by people less fortunate who are envious of the person.<br>
I haven't always thought greed was a good thing.  It was a news report on ABC I think about 3 years ago on &quot;greed is good&quot;  opened my eyes a bit.  It would be nice if everyone did things out of the good of their heart but they don't.<br>
<br>
&quot;An eager desire or longing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thats the one I'm thinking of.. The desire to gain more wealth motivates people to strive for their best.. Shall I bring up why communism failed?<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually Gaelron you did defend quadding near/through/by the graveyard.&quot;<br>
<br>
I misunderstood what he said.. I thought he meant quading in the zone then training out...If you read on later.  You would see I said IT WASNT OKAY TO TRAIN DIRECTLY through the GY.   Its okay to train out.  Oh and I don't want to quote again but I didnt say I LIKE to quad behind the GY.  I said I will if I need to to get root room to so can gate and in turn save lives.. I don't want to train people but if I need to for safety then it happens.<br>
<br>
&quot;Basically if your in the same zone as Gaelron expect to be trained no matter where you are if it means saving his ass. No bones about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rofl thats funny.  Been in PoN for like uh 30 hours so far probably a bit less. About 50 quads.. TWO trains in that time and those were back to back because I was sleepy.  <br>
<br>
&quot;you liked ksing your guildmates and hogging the exp nuff said. &quot;<br>
<br>
Rofl.. Competition doesn't mean anything if you get everything.. In fact I barely get any exp on raids even if there isnt raid groups.  I got 10 exp kills in ssra last night because I am there to kill HP or whatever not for exp.  Having the competition there is nice too.<br>
<br>
&quot;Clearly not a debate when you come here and whine.&quot;<br>
<br>
People come here to whine and flame some sure but I see some debating too.  I'd say the manaburn threads were debating.  I gained some valuable insight into what other people feel about it than just the propaganda on Graffe.  Venting is different than whining.. Some of the early posts on issues maybe venting because I'm upset but after a few. I get my head on straight and think.. Everyone has done this plenty of times.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guess they just cant stand you, and who can blame them really.&quot;  <br>
<br>
lol.. Number 1.. I don't even ask them you retard.  Number 2.  I check if any are close and if they are and can't res me then its because they are busy.. I have had numerous times where I've gotten a res by a RiP cleric who went out of his way but I perfer not to have that happen because I wouldn't want to do it either.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gaelron you asked for my motivation and directly said I was jealous.&quot;<br>
<br>
I said  Are you jealous?  I didn't imply it.. Funny how questions work isnt it?<br>
<br>
&quot;Quadding isnt a challenge. Been there done that. Its boring. Getting a pick up group and pushing your skills to the limit on tough mobs in new zones - thats a challenge - not quadding low blues.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quading is a challenge.. The stuff in PoV was one of the hardest quads I've ever done.  Pickup groups hardly ever do hard zones and if they do.. They hardly test themselves because they want fast exp.  The trials in PoJ are an example of tough in a group situation.. Would like to see more things like that..<br>
<br>
&quot;And it is about you - you never bitch about nerfs that dont affect you, even if they screw your guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
Did you not read my posts on Mod rod 2 and CH? Maybe you misunderstood my &quot;venting&quot; during the manaburn/Modrod/CH/monk nerfs because nearly none of it was directed at manaburn.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not everyone is completely lacking any sense of ethics like yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have taken advantage of a true bug once and I didn't do too well at it heh..  Content issues is hardly an ethical issue.  So everyone who manaburned a dragon before its nerf is unethical? Every monk who was a MT is unethical?  Everyone who quaded in PoV was unethical?<br>
<br>
Id have a better arguement that people who use SEQ are unethical though I wouldn't call them that but there are hundreds of people who do use is.. So are they unethical?<br>
<br>
&quot;you collectively [meaning people who abused it which obviously includes you] are to blame for you own woes now just like manaburn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yea those 2 hours in PoV I spent quading really caused VI to nerf it.  The 60k i made off manaburn kills really caused VI to nerf that too even though they stated thats not the reason it was nerfed.  I don't even count the people who made hundreds of thousands of Plat greedy.  But I guess you do.. Let me direct you to some.<br>

&quot;Guess they just cant stand you, and who can blame them really.&quot; <br>
<br>
lol.. Number 1.. I don't even ask them you retard. Number 2. I check if any are close and if they are and can't res me then its because they are busy.. I have had numerous times where I've gotten a res by a RiP cleric who went out of his way but I perfer not to have that happen because I wouldn't want to do it either.<br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Retard? lol make up your mind you buffoon first you say they wont res you now you say they will. Did you lie in the quote I pasted or are you lying now? Which is it?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

&quot;Gaelron you asked for my motivation and directly said I was jealous.&quot;<br>

I said Are you jealous? I didn't imply it.. Funny how questions work isnt it?<br>

&quot;Quadding isnt a challenge. Been there done that. Its boring. Getting a pick up group and pushing your skills to the limit on tough mobs in new zones - thats a challenge - not quadding low blues.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quading is a challenge.. The stuff in PoV was one of the hardest quads I've ever done. Pickup groups hardly ever do hard zones and if they do.. They hardly test themselves because they want fast exp. The trials in PoJ are an example of tough in a group situation.. Would like to see more things like that..<br>
--<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What does quad kiting have to do with the trials? answer NOTHING. Quadding is easy everyone knows this get over yourself.

&quot;And it is about you - you never bitch about nerfs that dont affect you, even if they screw your guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
Did you not read my posts on Mod rod 2 and CH? Maybe you misunderstood my &quot;venting&quot; during the manaburn/Modrod/CH/monk nerfs because nearly none of it was directed at manaburn.<br>
--<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>k this is just more lying and confusing the issue - you may have mentioned other nerfs in passing but you made tens of posts about manaburn - get a grip.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

&quot;Not everyone is completely lacking any sense of ethics like yourself.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have taken advantage of a true bug once and I didn't do too well at it heh.. Content issues is hardly an ethical issue. So everyone who manaburned a dragon before its nerf is unethical? Every monk who was a MT is unethical? Everyone who quaded in PoV was unethical?<br>
<br>
Id have a better arguement that people who use SEQ are unethical though I wouldn't call them that but there are hundreds of people who do use is.. So are they unethical?<br>
--<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Clearly you dont understand what the word ethics means and all the fluff in the above section had nothing to do with the original point.

&quot;you collectively [meaning people who abused it which obviously includes you] are to blame for you own woes now just like manaburn.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yea those 2 hours in PoV I spent quading really caused VI to nerf it. The 60k i made off manaburn kills really caused VI to nerf that too even though they stated thats not the reason it was nerfed. I don't even count the people who made hundreds of thousands of Plat greedy. But I guess you do.. Let me direct you to some.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Once again you demonstrate that you cant comprehend what collectively means shrug tried to explain this three times now guess your just that stupid. Not that thats news.<br>

Can't you just accept you don't know anything and try to make things or twist my words so you think people will think you are smart when you aren't.  If everyone really had so much trouble with me.. Don't you think I would be guildless and others on this board would tell me to leave for good?  besides posting a bit too much here.. I find other people agree with some not all of my ideals.. Thats why its called an opinion because no everyone will agree with you.  You also have flamed me twice or three times as much as much as I have of you.  You are just trying to drag my name through the mud when you are making yourself look like a fool (that isnt a flame its a fact) instead.  <br>
<br>
On numerous occasions you have been told to stop posting on a subject when I have never been.<br>
<br>
This time I will not endlessly quote you because its pointless and no one is reading it.. You are just reposting the same stuff over and over again.<br>
<br>
Except for one quote<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>  So dont then I dont give a damn if you like my posts or not. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->  <br>
<br>
So I'm suppose to ignore you are attacking me?  You don't have to read any of my posts either.. Nice logic you got there to cover yourself<br>
<br>
If you really believe that I'm some kind of loot whore, exp hogger, training, social invert. Then why don't you gather what my guildmates and other people that I socialize with to see what they think... Go ahead and post what they think as long as they say its okay.<br>
<br>
oh and Communism failed because people weren't working hard enough from lack of motivation for life improvement. Which is a part of greed.  When you go live on a farm with a family in a small house with only enough food to live then call me.. until then you are movated by a main human feeling.. Greed.<br>
<br>
and of course clerics should only die if they need to.  I wouldn't want to be in a group where the cleric gates and lets everyone die so they can supposely res them at the end.  Good memory though on that one.  That was a really long time ago.. Way to hold a grudge.. I didn't against you but now that you keep bringing all this stuff up again.. Just shows I am more mature than you.<br>

Gaelron said:<br>

BTW there is a differance between clarification and totally changing what you said. Obviously you are to much of a simpleton to tell the differance.<br>

What you did is this - for example (an analogy) - you claimed:<br>

then you asserted that you really said:<br>
'the sky is blue'<br>
then you said to clarify:<br>
'The sky is purple'<br>

<br>
Even with this bazaar system I can still make some decent money , it's like real estate or stocks - you just need money to start.<br>
<br>
And let's see. The only times I have ever taken anything for myself on a raid have been ... my SS arms ... *AND THAT IS IT. DO NOT MAKE ME SPELL THAT OUT TO YOU AGAIN.*<br>
<br>
I have, however, run things with friends to get me things, like my epic. Mind you, I did end up buying SEoC after clearing hate 4 times and .. nothing .. and I ended up buying a reaver, due to the fact .. 59 hours in com ... nothing.<br>
<br>
My bracer of benevolence was another of those occasions, most of the people that helped (thanks again mk) were just wandering the wastes.<br>
<br>
My Eyepatch isn't the same, however, I had let CiA take lodi, due to the fact only me and my 2box'd borrowed cleric and a lvl42 ranger were there when he popped. They gave me my map-peice, and I passed on the loot (but I swore I would get one of those damned belts ... well, I have one, but $$$ not from killing.)<br>
<br>
I did not use greed to take an item that someone else needed, but when I was sure that I could benefit more from something (epics, BoB), I would step up. <br>
<br>
That is just the person I am, and I know many others like that. Maybe you need to open your eyes a little more, out past your own guild, out past your own friends, maybe you will see that to a good chunk of us, loot means nothing.<br>
<br>
I'm already wearing a thurg bp + legs, and alot better then thurg gear in my other slots. Why do I do kael so often? It's fun, I love it. Why would I do kael's plate cycle? according to you, I would want loot to get motivated for it .. not the case, i'm not a plate class. <br>
<br>
Yes, I want loot .. for MY GUILDMATES. I couldn't give a fuck if I never get another quested/dropped item ever again (probably wont), because gaethan, greed may be good a good motivator (which it is, hence the DKP point system), but some, like myself, have little to no use for this. <br>
<br>
Maybe it's a wizard or a gay trait ;P<br>

That is greed talking for the first one but I don't see a problem with that because the person who asks is either limited by points or  by someone's choice or they just want the guy to drop some good loot for others which is still linked to greed.<br>
<br>
If a mob dropped no loot at all.. Would people still do him? Those who wouldn't are motivated by greed.. Not necessarily a bad thing... Depends on the situation.<br>
<br>
I do look outside my guild.. It doesn't matter what guild you are in.. Greed excessive or not is in everyone.. To the level 1 to the lvl65 with AA.  Its a basic human feeling that affects all.. It is an asset if you use it right.. It is a liability when you let it consume you.<br>
<br>
It may not affect you at all.. You maybe the Santa of Norrath never taking ahead of anyone else.. Only playing for the sheer thrill of playing.. There are definitely those out there and I tip my cap to them but the majority want loot, levels and to be the best they can be.  Nothing wrong with that.<br>
<br>
That clear that up? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Others see it of a way of advancing the game. Every time u see an 'omgiwantit' item, and u want it, and u roll for it or bid for it, thats greed. Its not harmful, its the things u do after u dont get it that effects people.<br>
<br>
We wouldnt kill names if it wasnt for the thought of loot or plat.<br>
<br>
Fkin, why are u just attacking Gaethan for no reason whatsoever. Just cus u dont agree with him doesnt call for attacking him.<br>
<br>
Unless you get ya kicks that way, then you're a fucktard. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

<br>
You may objectify them to the same thing but i suspect most people would read these two sentences differently:<br>
<br>
&quot;he was being greedy&quot;<br>
&quot;he wanted that&quot;<br>
<br>
It seems like symantics but clearly by the differing viewpoints some use greed with negative inclination.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Greed n. the negative personification of want<br>
<br>
or something might be a definition.   <br>
<br>
Notice i didnt quote websters.  The key here isnt the dictionary defintion or the &quot;correct&quot; definition but rather the implied defintion in actual use.<br>
<br>
there can be no doubt that most people have some sort of concept of negative in greed.   If by applied definition has a negative component then objectively white washing it into another word for &quot;want&quot; will never fly in persuasive argument.<br>
