<br>
Montyy is an Epic Stealer.<br>
Montyy is a hypocrit<br>
Montyy is an Epic farmer.<br>
bla bla bla<br>
<br>
Let's get the facts straight, shall we.<br>
<br>
First off... Montyy got an Epic that he didn't &quot;need&quot;.  So?  Does anyone out there have the first CLUE as to how many Epic Battles Montyy Main Tanked to get drops for others?  Just from battles that he and I shared, I can prolly rattle off a few dozen.  Hell, most of Lor Mani (those there when Montyy and I were around) owes him huge for his work in getting them their epics.  Epics are not only useful... but they are a status symbol.  They show that you did your time, busted your arse, and triumphed.<br>
<br>
After watching so many others get their Epics, Montyy is more than entitled to his... regardless of whether or not he &quot;needs&quot; it.<br>
<br>
So Gae gave Montyy a scale... big fekkin Whoop!  How the hell else was he gonna get one?  MB wasnt known to be getting nerfed when he got it... so the MB squads still OWNED Sev.<br>
<br>
&quot;But Montyy is in RiP... and RiP is Uber... and can kill Kunark Dragons easily&quot;<br>
<br>
They dont waste their time anymore on Kunark dragons.  Period.<br>
<br>
Montyy is a hypocrit cause he sold an Epic drop?  Bah!  Reavers are a joke... and he and I have killed them hundreds of times.... and we've gotten dozens of Jade Reavers.  When we got them, they were given away to folks that needed them (mains or twinks)... or friends... or guildies...  and when no one we knew needed them, we sold them and split the profits with the people that attended the Reaver killing.  <br>
<br>
What's wrong with that?<br>
<br>
Ohhhh... you say he's deprived someone of Epic loot?  Nope.  He's given away all he could, ran out of friends to give them to, and now is selling to help friends still.... and all this from a day of goofing around with a twink group.  As it is, Reavers are a 2 hour spawn... and there are 5-6 of them.  Each Reaver when it dies can immediately respawn another Reaver... which means that every 2 hours, you can realistically get 10 or so Reavers to kill.  10 Reavers every 2 hours is 120 Reavers per day.... or Roughly 700 Reavers per week.  And you compare this to MBing Sev?  You compare 1 mob per week to a potential 700?  <br>
<br>
Welcome to Reality.  May I take your coat?<br>
<br>
Montyy is an Epic farmer?  Nope.  Montyy likes CoM.  So do I.  Between 3 toons, I've spent close to 40 levels XPing in CoM.  He's prolly spent about the same amount of time there as well.  He and I love the place... and we love hunting there... and with the xp modifications to higher level mobs, and the CoM dungeon bonus... Reavers are damn good xp... even at 60 imo.<br>
<br>
So Montyy killed a few Reavers, got a JR, and sold it.  When he left CoM... there were 5-6 more Reavers repopping... just waiting to be killed by anyone wanting Epic drops, XP, or just a new challenge.<br>
<br>
When Faithkills and the MB squads burn Sev... there's nothing left.  And 7 days later, they're right back there doing it again.<br>
<br>
And you still compare Montyy to the MB Squads?<br>
<br>
STFU! <p><center>

<br>
But..<br>
<br>
Montyy isn't exactly right either.. From the hundreds of posts Montyy has made on Manaburn here. I gathered that he didn't like Wizards burning dragons because they were stealing mid-level content and getting rich off it.  He made it sound as if ALL wizards were like this.  Montyy may not have worded every post correctly but I understood why he was against manaburn but everyone seems to like to dissect people's post for errors instead of looking at the big picture.<br>
<br>
There are definitely greedy wizards out there that made other wizards look really bad but FK isn't one of them just because she stands up for manaburn. <p><center>

<br>
Welcome to Reality. May I take your coat?&quot; <br>
<br>
Why don't you try and be a bit more realistic.  I love how people try to downplay the  this camp for the majority of rangers and druids simply because they happen to get a lucky streak on seeing a few jade reavers drop while they were there for a shaman or magician or simply &quot;messing around&quot;.<br>
<br>
I've done this damned camp more times than I care to count both for myself and others, and in my own multiple attempts to obtain my jade reaver was the absolute worst part of my epic quest.  A sufficient force to kill them is not going to sit in CoM 24/7 for a week to camp black reavers because MOST people do live in the real world.  Assuming a group even stays on for 6 hours that's two full clearings maybe three, it takes about 50-60 minutes for a single group in SS/Kael and epic or closely equipped to clear, henceforth the spawn time is going to be staggered.  They don't all instantly respawn two hours from the first one's death.  The drop rate is approximately 1%.  Average is one insta spawn after the first dies, with a good chance of no respawn, the most insta-spawns I've seen from a single reaver is five. (And surprise surprise, a jade reaver did NOT drop.)  Assuming three clearings that's 30-40 reavers in a six hour period.  Now after seven or so odd days of this a jade reaver finally drops.  Said ranger or druid just spent 40 hours attempting to get their jade reaver.  An average work week for most, whereas that green scale involved maybe a half hour to an hour of work at most.  Oh, maybe by some fluke the scale doesn't drop that week.  Next week it does drop.  Two maybe three hours spent actively attempting to get a green scale.  If you want to argue that the warrior has to compete with other warriors then you have to make that same consideration for druids and rangers since a lot of them get theirs on a random in their guild during a CoM raid for another guildmember.  So to anyone thinking that obtaining a jade reaver is less work than a dragon scale because &quot;a dragon only spawns once a week&quot;  I'm sure that Severilous has spawned more than 52 times in the past year so stick it in File 86.<br>
<br>
Quasqueton states:  &quot;we sold them and split the profits with the people that attended the Reaver killing. <br>
<br>
What's wrong with that?&quot;<br>
<br>
The same thing that's wrong with selling dragon loot.  As far as I'm concerned, nothing, but is apparently some sin of the highest order if it's a warrior epic drop being sold.  But, you don't see me getting up and slamming people for selling stuff for a profit or saying other groups have no right to do so.  It would be hypocritical of me since I believe in the concept that EQ players have the right to sell legitimate products and services for a reasonable price to make a profit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Esmalyn states:  &quot;The minute Montyy took part in what he swore he would never do (accept an item from a burn, a passive form of supporting farming that does not require a transaction since he argued that burners took content away from mid-level guilds even if they gave the items away) he lost credibility in the eyes of some, myself included.

<br>
That essentially sums it up.<br>
<br>

P. S.  Oh god, I'm completely and unequivocally agreeing with Esmalyn on something.  Hell must have frozen over.<br>

Millikin.. you missed everything I said.<br>
<br>
You look at this from the opposite perspective than I do.<br>
<br>
You are fixated on the item. The item is not an issue in this case.  The opportunity is.  <br>
<br>
You can get your Jade Reaver crew together ANY time... any time at all.. and go to the CoM.. anytime at all.. and the worst case scenario is.. someone is killing the reavers and you will have to wait TWO HOURS till they leave to try any.. assuming ALL are taken...  Severilous is the only source of green scales for any warrior that would actually use his epics (likely to get upgrades to epic just killing Silverwing and Hoshkar in VP)... and the opportunity.. should you win, lose, should it drop or not, should you have a chance at even getting a crew to TRY the dragon or not.. is one time a week.<br>
<br>
It's not MB wizards even being evil bastards..it's that the MB skill allowed wizards to make already-scarce raiding mobs for midlevel guilds become cash farms.  The wizards aren't being *bad*, they are playing the game as it is given to them (and us)... but the fact the game ended up with such a poorly designed setup with those dragons and manaburn was a bad thing for the server,  in terms of opportunity and content. <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

You still think Jade Reaver's are rare? Heh. <br>
Let me do the math for you.<br>
<br>
Black Reaver spawn time = approximately 2 hours.<br>
Severilous spawn time = 7 days.<br>
<br>
Now, let's say you kill ALL the Sev's that spawn in a week....... that's one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now, let's say you kill all the Black Reaver's that spawn in a week. There are at least 4 Reaver's in CoM. There are 168 hours in a week. That makes 336 Reavers. Now, some of these can split 1 or 2 times. That's 672-1008 Reaver's in one week. That = 7 to 10 Jade Reavers a week, ASSUMING 1% drop rate, which I still doubt considering how many I've seen while doing shaman epic raids there. And yes, you're not going to be there 24/7, but other groups and raids could be when you're not. You guys are just thinking about YOU, again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Sev can also drop no green scale. So it's a possiblity of 0 per week also.<br>
<br>
Also, if you don't know how to pull the very top Reaver in CoM without clearing stuff, well, get a good Rogue, like me! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
5 mins later, every Reaver in zone is dead, woot. <br>
<br>
M.E., name the MAIN char druids and rangers in your guild without epic, please. Not counting twinks. <br>
<br>
Welcome to EverQuest, this isn't reality. You don't wear a coat. Epic drops for some classes are different rarity then others.<br>
<br>
I'm STILL waiting for a single group to kill Gorenaire without MB too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

That 'sufficeint' force that is required to kill reavers in my case was my 52 twink monk, a 40  rogue to pick the locks, a 50 or 51 (ferget) necro and a 60 cleric healing us. I know thats a huge force and numbers like that are hard to gather but c'mon I have faith....<br>
<br>
As for you're statement on the ranger/druid competition for reavers...hmm where is this? I've done about 30-35 levels total in CoM on 3 various toons, and Reavers are rarely camped.... I think in the entire time I was leveling from 40-52 with my monk in CoM, i can count the amount of times they were camped on 1 hand. Sorry no competition there. Once again, these are apples and Oranges....sure the odds of Sev dropping a scale are greater than a black reaver dropping a jade reaver...but black reavers are almost ALWAYS available to kill and require 1 group or less, whereas Sev is a rarer sight than a full set of teeth in west virginia and also requires at least 2 or more groups (non MBers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
For esmalyn and co, so I'm a sellout for accepting a scale from gaethan? heh sure if you say so <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I'd consider myself a sell out if I asked gaethan, or any of the 5 or 6 other RIP MB wizards, to burn Sev to get me a scale.

<br>
<br>
it occurs to me that the mana per a tick gain by using a god rod is easier to analysis then before.  <br>
<br>
the new god rod will be a 1 per a person per a minute at 450 damage at 360 mana increase.  Now ignoring the damage to be healed and the mage cost we see that a caster can get 36 mana a tick for 45 damage a tick.  Note how much easier this is to analysis becuase before healing casters would routinely godrod themselves to nothing heal up and have a little extra mana for their trouble.  but now its more like a battle of the ticks.  36 mana a tick if you can sustain 45 damage a tick.<br>
<br>
But now i noted that i can get 45 hp tick regen just bout. 22 from fungi and 3 pts regen. another 15 from regrowth of the grove. (natures grove will get ya 30 a tick but it only last 3 min)  6 from potg. 4 from nature skin.<br>
Total regen with AA, fungi, druid buffs: 47<br>
<br>
Ahh 47.  Now note that the priest classes can wear a fungi.  Now note they can get a sustainable 36 mana a tick if they can regen 45 hp a tick.  now note they can with just a fungi, AA, and druid buffs.<br>
<br>
my example is junk  first of course they havent announced the mana cost to the mage yet. also wizards also have a regen item out there. and a wizard/druid/mage/enchanter will outdamage a druid/druid/mage/enchanter <br>
<br>
(but interestingly a wizard/wizard/mage/enchanter prolly wont be able to outdamage a druid/druid/mage/enchanter over the long haul if the mage mana cost of the rod is low enough assuming it comes down from 400.  wizards are good but they cant deal with druids having twice as much mana becuase of regen)<br>
<br>
but i wanted to point out that priest classes should be /drooling over the regen items out there as before they would be modulate+modulate + etc  + big heal.  where as now they need to use that modulate more efficiently. they need to take it and have regen heal it in the minute before the next one.  <br>
<br>
still its a nerf.  im just giving a way to make yourself more potent as a priest class in the post nerf mod rod world and it runs through fungi.<br>

<br>
Well first off I can't say how pleased I am that you think Sev spawn time is 7 days<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway..<br>
<br>
Regarding your sad attempt at analysis:<br>
<br>
The reality is most people have trouble getting their guild to keep going back to CoM to get them reavers. And most people working on their epic don't have an uber group to help them. Like phinny its a pain in the ass and it's hard to get people to go and you can't solo it and after a while you feel really bad about asking.<br>
<br>
Even with the invalid assumption Sev spawns once a week, how long can you actually hunt reavers? With a two hour spawn and 1% drop rate your chances are not very good you will get one in one weeks RL time. Even if you can get friends to spend 20 hours a week hunting reavers your chances of getting a reaver aren't very good.<br>
<br>
But we don't need analysis we have direct empirical evidence.<br>
<br>
Jade Reaver sells for 12-15k.<br>
Red Dragon Scale sells for 4-6K.<br>
Green Dragon Scale sells for 20-25k.<br>
<br>
So handwaving all you want these are the real values of these items, determined the only valid way. By what people will pay for them.<br>
<br>
Montyy did exactly what he criticized burners for doing. He killed something that was EASY for HIM to kill and sold the proceeds. Despite it was for an epic.<br>
<br>
He criticized burners as being greedy farmers.. yet Geathan didn't SELL him a scale.. he GAVE him a scale. For all I know Geathan <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sold an epic drop, and it would not suprise me in the least if he hasn't. I certainly never sold an epic drop.<br>
<br>
He said burners were taking epic drops from people who 'need' them. Yet he took one, and he didn't 'need' it at all. At least if you sell one it goes to use.<br>
<br>
Sorry it's not complicated and quite cut and dried. He's a greedy hippocrit.<br>
<br>
FK<br>
<br>
PS Burn Team 2.0 has already taken down Talendor on Inoruuk. The nerf didn't stop farming. It didn't do anything good at all. Hmm who predicted that? The nerf has seriously made me rethink my policy on giving 'traditional' raids the right of way.
