Well it's a bunch of things, really. It certainly wasn't random.<br>
<br>
1) Fed up with being a druid. On the one hand, you have this huge pile of druid hate from, oh, half the server population. OTOH, you have an infinite stream of beggars and moochers who think you've got nothing better to do than PL them. I really wanted a change of class. On Xegony I've been a rogue and cleric, and until I quit last week, an enchanter, and boy was that fun. I did it quite well, too.<br>
<br>
2) You and I were not getting along. Don't deny it, we weren't, simple as that, and it was a two-way street, meaning it was as much my fault. Even if I had kept a cool head and not left the server, I would have left the guild, if only to restart as the rogue. Actually, I'm surprised you asked. I'd figured you more than anyone else was glad I was gone.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I felt like I had to leave the server. I'd said here I was quitting, told my friends like Naelyur and Aspro adios, the guild knew I'd quit. If I reappeared, I'd have felt foolish. Of course that doesn't explain why I post here, does it? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3) Pissed at some people. Some were in RIP, some were not. I'd rather not say more. It's been five months, why dredge up old angers?<br>
<br>
4) RL problems. Really, this should be number one. My work has been in terrible shape due to the economy and 9/11 and it was really starting to get to me. I was in crappy physical condition from playing EQ and not working out. It all wore on me. I turned to EQ for relief from those problems and all it did was give me grief as well.<br>
<br>
So I just left. No need for a flame war or to go out like Xelera, Trinitii and Kalakar did, although I did wish I'd told Pyrrolin what an idiot I thought he was. Deguilded, moved all my characters to EC, made a list of droppable stuff, sold it to one of the guys on Playerauctions who sells gear (boy did he fuck me, too, talk about lowballing) and deleted everything. Had zero intention of ever coming back until a good RL friend said 'come play on Xegony with me.' So I moved the rogue and Galiana. The rogue was my main for the longest time, Galiana was just transportation. Shoulda seen him. Full suit of Woven Shadow, which I got in a single night on a PoH raid, his epic, 8th Coldain ring. He looked great and did some serious damage. I hope the new owner takes good care of him.<br>
<br>
I'm out for good now. Verant screwing us with the XP nerf was the last straw. Yeah they undid it, but I am not paying this company $300 a year for two accounts to be bent over and made their bitch and then hearing 'sorry' afterwards. Leveling post-54 sucks ass. I make more progress in an hour of Might and Magic IX than in eight hours of EQ.<br>
<br>
Besides, there was only one guild I wanted to join, Havenlight (they just did AoW without a single death or tank switch), and their rogue requirements were level 60 with 18 AA. I might get there around mid-2003, and quite frankly, I don't have time for that. I bought a bike in July and started getting my ogre-like physique down to something closer to a human. I live 2 miles from the Pacific Ocean, 8 miles by bike path from Venice Beach and 10 miles from Manhattan Beach. I'd rather be there than in Sebilis LFG or sitting around waiting on a Vindi raid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usephrokdapathfinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sephrok da Pathfinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/9/02 12:55:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=207>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Server Jerks</span><hr size=1> &quot;You and I were not getting along.

Well that makes me feel a whole ton better. I saw a high elf cleric being sold on PlayerAuctions a few months back and asked the buyer if it was Loral, because I'd heard rumors he was quitting, or if it was Dahktur, who had already been sold once (the original player was one of the coolest guys I'd ever met), and was told no on both accounts. Guess I know now.<br>
<br>
The worst he ever did was THO. Remember that one? Bloodshaww went down real early in the fight, although Uadar was the MA. You, me, Blood, and everyone else asked Pyrro to please rez Blood because his DPS was needed for such a long-ass fight. TEN MINUTES went by and still no rez. I kept thinking 'What a monumental shithead.' Alrik went down when the Elder THs respawned and lay dead for at least 5 minutes as well, no rez. I blamed our wipe on him not bothering to turn, select a corpse and click his epic. How were we supposed to get through that fight with Bloodshaww and Alrik down?<br>

Like I said, it was go, cut the cord, or a ton of frustration will come flying out, some of it would have been unfair, too, and I'd really act like an ass. <br>
<br>
Your first hint that I was unhappy should have been when I disappeared for a week to go play on Sullon Zek with Kalsto. But when I came back, no one said a word to me, no one asked where I'd been, nothing, so I figured no one would miss me.<br>
<br>
The MA thing really got under my skin, though. The last thing I expected was getting tells giving me a hard time for asking who the MA is. I mean, often times no one in my group knew and didn't bother to ask so I did, only to be chided again for not paying attention.<br>
<br>
Eh, forget about it. All my accounts are gone except Galiana, who I can't sell for reasons I won't go into. What's done is done.<br>

Hey Seph you have to take part of the blame for Pyrrolin's ego.  You built up his ego by making him first for ST key and other things to make him seem like the #1 cleric.. He was the first legitimate cleric in the guild and he knew this and said that regularly as felt some kind of senority so could control the other clerics.  He has issues but I think he is a good guy at heart. <p><center>

Juror, GuildLeader of HU.   I mean, he goes around helpin' people all day, doesn't accept payment, and even wears (semi) matchin' armor!!!  Heck, he's even polite, has a sense of humor (has to, to de-starchify Loral, /snicker), and brushes his teeth.<br>
<br>
/bonk Juror for bein' NICE!!!<br>

He isnt a jerk, just so dense, unresponsive, slow, and can't do anything you ask of him that he is a public saftey hazard. He is a mage, not sure what level he is now, went on a plane of air raid with him about a month ago.<br>
<br>
I will tell you now, if you see him coming to any raid you are on make a troll wall or something, cause he is so dense he just doesn't get it when he is not wanted, it took us 10 minutes to get him to jump off of plane of air and we could not pull because he had become a liability once we got to an area where we were getting more than one mob at a time.<br>
<br>
Also Id like to throw in my vote for Obsedianx as well, I dont know what annoys me more about her, the fear of being trained when I am in the same zone she is in, or the fact that she is always talking in zone wide channels in all caps, and do not want to put on ignore in case she actually says something before she trains. <p><a target= "new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=257041"><b>Vonic</b></a>

That was what I thought, too, that he was the 'senior' cleric in the guild. When I joined with that cleric I had, someone, I forget who, told me to watch and learn from Bakker because he was the best cleric in the guild, and they were right. It wasn't even newbie stuff, Pyrro was so sloppy and inattentive at what he did. If you're gonna be the senior of your class, and I do think that IS a good idea, then you should set the example of what TO be, not what NOT TO be. (oh boy does my grammar suck some times)<br>
<br>
I remember a failed Vindi raid where we were down to 2 mages pets and a few SKs and rogues, which meant game over once the mage pets were gone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Bakker, Hak and the female high elf cleric whose name I forget were camping out, Pyrro's walking around like it's a sunny day at the beach. I said &quot;Camp out, fool!&quot; so he sat. I made it out and came back 3 minutes later to see him walking around, naked except for epic, rezzing people, his corpse among the many others, and an unharmed Bakker sitting quietly in the corner.  Come to think of it. that's how every failed raid went. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I hope you guys got Bakker his clicker. He truly deserves it.<br>

You guys want my contribution to server jerks? Ok. A druid named Weren. Here's the scenario. I was working on my epic in LOIO, camping the corrupted barracuda. That was by far the longest camp, with over 8 hours wasted. When I got him, I realized I was in over my head. I could NOT handle him. I had a second account with a level 46 wiz, brought him on in a hurry, but together we still couldn't handle him.<br>
<br>
Along comes Weren. I beg him to help me. Does he heal Galiana? No. She dies. All that's left is an OOM level 46 wizard. Tainted dies and corrupted spawns. I BEG him, root the damn thing and leave it, I'll have Galiana back in a few minutes, and we can kill it.<br>
<br>
So what does he do? Kills the Corrupted and insists the epic item drop is his, despite repeated requests NOT to. So he loots the drop and says, essentially, 'too bad for you.'<br>
<br>
I was never so angry in the game, even to this day. No, I know what the contrarian will say, he was under no obligation to help. But there is such a thing as doing the right thing, you know? To screw over someone else of your class on their epic was about the lowest thing ever done to me in this game. I've killed that thing many times since, while camping the Bloodgill Marauder, and after it was dead, I'd shout to the zone that the first druid to reach my loc gets it for free. You should see the stampede some times. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
He showed his character. When asked for help, he took advantage of my situation. A few hours later, the same scenario happened, but this time, the druid who came along HELPED me. She healed me, rooted the Corrupted and helped kill it with DoTs then wished me luck and went on her way. She showed her character, too. Damn, I wish I could remember her name.<br>
<br>
Weren is in Wraith. Anyone surprised? <br>
<br>
One more jerk to add to the list: Citto. Ex-RIP guildmate, had quite possibly the most bitter personality I've ever seen. Just an intolerable, bile-filled human being. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sebilite Guardian</span><br>  Posts: 796<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/10/02 4:07:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=418.topic&index=216>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Server Jerks </span><hr size=1> SHE!<br>
