<br>
Get it through your heads that not everyone plays this game alike.  There ARE those of us that WANT to work for what we get.<br>
<br>
If you don't like... fuck off.  DO NOT generalized my style of play like every other loot-whore on the server.<br>

I play to have fun, everything else is just gravy :P<br>

<br>
and your other argument is &quot;FU, you would have done the same&quot; ??<br>
<br>
well, i guess we werent lucky enough to loot rifts w/o killing the mob that triggers the rift droppers just because a GM fucked up. so i guess we'll never know, will we?<br>
<br>
personally, (and honestly) i wouldnt have looted it, not only because its wrong, but because its a god damm exploit, and you can get banned for it. hell, if the GM's werent so fucking clueless, they would have rolled your character back to the last saved state before you looted the rift, losing all your xp, items etc that you got after that time, or even destroyed the completed VT key from your character. (i bet they would still fuck up and forget to delete it from your keyring haha)<br>
<br>
hey zupe, that should free up some bank slots, right? after all that justifies it!<br>
<br>
finally, to all the people saying that 8 people really doesnt make a difference, maybe it doesn't, maybe it does, but thats not the point, is it? <br>

You guys were killing TMs to space them far enough apart so that nobody else could start the cycle while you guys waited for people to show up.  We were killing REPOPS on your spaced out TMs and waiting for them to spawn, and almost didn't get them all within the hour because they were spaced so far apart.  You guys were stalling til you got more in zone, and had no intention of starting the cycle until you had more people there.  You had NO idea that the cycle was gimped and the mobs were not AEing that night, so don't lie and say you planned to engage with your 17 people.  You are in fact the one lying here.  It was impossible to do the Cursed cycle with 17 people before, and nobody expected it to be as easy as it was that night.  So please, stop twisting the truth every time you Expoofit people come here posting your lies.  You guys seem to have no problem jumping over other guilds (or trying to get getting shot down), but if someone jumps your little 17 man crew you guys get pissed and flame people to hell and back.  You're making a lot of friends here, and have become the new hated guild on the server.  Thanks for taking so much heat off of Wraith/Reviv since I think we held that title for the last 9 or 10 months because people were pissed we were killing the mobs they wanted.  Now nobody cares what we do, and people have focused on hating Explicit because you guys act like asses and won't work with the other guilds the way the rest of us do.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The rest of us take turns like good little boys and girls, and try to respect each other if another guild has ENOUGH THERE TO KILL THE MOB, unlike Explicit on this Cursed Cycle.  But what do I know, I'm just a blind poster who was in zone to see you had 17 people, and NOT 30 or 40 like you guys said earlier when you accused us of KSing you.  Originally it was &quot;We had 40 in zone and Wraith/Reviv KSed us!&quot;, and now it's &quot;We were gonna engage with 17 people and would had 30 by the time Cursed popped!&quot;  Get your shit straight, bro.

And YES, PRE-GIMPED GHY AND EXIL WAS KILLED BY 21 PPl!!!!  Even if we only had 17 (WHICH WE HAD MORE!!) + like 4 recruit...WE STILL HAD ENOUGH PPL FOR THE GOD DAMN CYCLE PRE-GIMPED!!! AND WE DID HAVE 30s PPL WHEN GHY POP AND 40s LATER.  WE HAD LESS PPL WHEN CURSED POP BECOZ MOST OF US PORTED TO KAEL DUE TO YOUR GUILD'S KS ACTION. So, let me say this again.  WE HAD ENOUGH, STOP TRYING TO TWIST FACTS AROUND. WE ARE NOT THE GUILD WHO TRIED TO CLAIM THE WHOLE ST WITH 6 PPL.  &lt;---cheap shot<br>

I dont care if they get it or not.  <br>
<br>
1) Not like that can go VT with 8 ppl<br>
<br>
2) I would have looted it if I was there. Why not? free key always good. Not like the keys will be hard to get, POP coming soon anyway.  Exploit? Nope. Bug? Nope.  Stupid GM mistake? Yup.  I dont see any rule against taking advantage of GM mistakes if the mistake isn't breaking the rule--remember a certain GM spawned 4 or 5 ragefire in a row in another server?  All those ppl knew it's GM mistake, did it stop them from killing RF? Nope.  You see a mob, you kill it, you loot. Sounds good to me.<br>
<br>
3) I dont see this any diff from Wraith killed the gimped Crused and get all the loots because GM forget to /kill it.  Just put yourself in their shoes.  If this happened to LC, what would you do?

This is the first time I have read this board, mainly because I was curious as to how others were flaming Vis (which btw I see no point in) but what I was AMAZED to find is that this is not really a Vis flame thread as I expected to see.. nope, it is a Explicit/(Wraith? I guess) argument thread full of USELESS bickering and chest heaving.. Lol, brings back long lost memories of high school.  Haha, I have heard stories about the QC flame boards but did not forsee the lack of civility.. out of 11 pages of posts I have seen maybe 4 or 5 posts which actually have a point, the rest of the posts seem to go nowhere, make no point, just name calling and bickering.  My god people, ask yourself if any of this has accomplished anything.. or does it just make you feel good?<br>
<br>
Please, some ADULTS post (please remain on topic as well).. I very much care how Vis Maior is viewed in other adults eyes. Sometimes we stumble, but I truly believe that we very much attempt honorable gamelplay.. immature audiences need not reply (however, I am quite certain you will anyway).<br>
<br>
In hindsight, looting the rifts may have not been the honorable thing to do (for those who did it) but to be honest, it is not really a big deal LOL.. 8 peeps not gonna do much in VT, and to be honest it is not like VM has not worked HARD, in fact we have been at this at least as long as all the other guilds if not longer.. WE HAVE WORKED HARD!  The real issue imo is that other guilds do NOT want us in VT, for their own reasons (monopoly busters are always hated by the monopolizers).. I think this is obvious to all, and if the cards were dealt out to us first, I am quite certain we would feel the same way, true.<br>
<br>
well, that is all.. hope the mature outweigh the immature in the ensuing posts =D<br>

I guess you're being...sarcastic? I don't understand why it's a big deal. Well, maybe I do. It's not so much the act that bothers Salta and others as the idea that they may have to share VT sooner than they would have without the GM making the mistake. Any gain is much too soon in a so far private play yard. I can get anal about right and wrong as ::cough:: evidenced in this thread. But the key is -not- that big a deal. It's a freebie; a one-time perk and no one got hurt in the process (train/ks/scam/hack).<br>
<br>
I would have looted it just as I would have picked up a $20 dollar bill in a parking lot and slipped it into my pocket. If you want to compare that to “stealing” like some of you want to compare looting extra keys to “cheating,” I’m afraid I will have to pass on your impossible--and perhaps transient--standards. The only one that can determine what toons “deserve” is Verant. Saying VM didn’t deserve the keys is as personal as saying x-player doesn’t deserve his epic because he’s an ass. Coming here and saying you would have done otherwise does not make VM wrong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uimpudent.showPublicProfile?language=EN>impudent</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Uber guild basher <br><font color=blue>QC Supporter</span><br>  Posts: 172<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/21/02 11:13:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=224>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Deserve?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I know with the company of people in this thread there would be 8 keys made, you hypocrits. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Since you made a blanket statement about everyone posting on this board (me included), which part of Fuck Off, did you not understand?<br>
<br>
As I said prior, DO NOT generalize my play style until you group with me.  If you cannot grasp that concept, I suggest you go back to sticking your head in the ground (better?).<br>
<br>
Not everyone plays ONLY for &quot;uber&quot; loot.  Not everyone plays JUST to be in an &quot;uber&quot; guild.  Not everyone plays JUST to screw other people.<br>
<br>
Before you make VERY general statements, think about who else posts here. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804>Impudent Blasphemy</a><BR>

(i bet they would still fuck up and forget to delete it from your keyring haha)&quot;<br>
<br>
Then why the fuck didn't they do that? If it was such an &quot;exploit&quot;, Verant employees certainly would have taken action. IT WAS A NPC THAT WAS UP IN THE FUCKING ROOM THAT HAPPENED TO BE IN OUR PATH TO BLOOD. No exploit there, we didn't force it to spawn, we didn't use fucked up coding to our advantage. It was a &quot;mistake&quot; made by a Verant employee, no exploit on our part.<br>
<br>
Now I know several of you messageboard whoring, no life having, nortoriously serverwide known jackasses petitioned us....so whats the deal? I'm still waiting for 8 people to get &quot;banned&quot; for this atrocious &quot;exploit&quot;...<br>
<br>
Verant generally deals with exploits quickly and sternly. <br>
To the best of my knowledge not a single one of those 8 people have been confronted in any way by a GM regarding this issue. So much for your fucking claims of exploit...<br>
<br>
Oh, and when VM has a 300 member roster and Emp raid attendance in the 100s, finding &quot;legit tactics&quot; shouldn't be an issue. Heh, and that's not including a pet guild to tote around!<br>
But I don't think that is going to happen any time soon, we'll just have to figure a way to do it with our usual 60ish without &quot;legit tactics&quot; =/ <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/unilaen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nilaen</A> at: 10/21/02 1:50:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugurunt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gurunt</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Havusin reads all my posts</span><br>  Posts: 346<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/21/02 12:17:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=588.topic&index=230>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Deserve?</span><hr size=1> <br>
Heh they said they killed glyphed and exiled with 21, not cursed.<br>
<br>
Lets drop that.  It's the same crap everyone does to everyone else (don't have &quot;enough&quot; people claiming, and get beat to the mob).    Everyone has done it,  everyone has it done to them, everyone feels justified when they do it, and feel they are being wronged when it's done to them.<br>
<br>
Rifts are the same thing.  GM screwed up.  The GM's know they have them.  The GM's will either take the rifts/keys away, or do nothing.  If they take them away, Vis has no reason to bitch since it was a GM error. (Same as with our cursed, we knew a gm could /kill it or even poof the corpse... we were prepared if that had happened to walk away without complaint).   Granted we kill cursed regularly anyway, and the VT key is more significant than a cursed drop, but same principal.  It's not worth getting upset about, either at Vis or at the situation.<br>

I don't hate Vis and I don't think everyone in Vis is evil for doing it.  I do think the Vis newbs who are so quick to defend their new home are kind of amusing and fun to watch post though.<br>

I dont think that fits really, how about..<br>

Instead of getting 10 dollars back in change, you get 100.<br>

Do you give it back or do you keep it. You know its wrong, but it was also a mistake someone else did, do you chose to take advantage of it, or do you say &quot;Hey you gave me way too much money back, here you go.&quot;<br>

In RL, I would give it back.  In game, I would keep it =). Have you ever pick up pp on ground (be it 200 sp or 800 cp or 50gp etc)? Do you keep it or ask around if anyone drop it? I know I would keep for sure.<br>
