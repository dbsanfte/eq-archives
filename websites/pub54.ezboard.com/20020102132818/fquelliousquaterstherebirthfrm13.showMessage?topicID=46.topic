The other day, I rec'd a tell from a buddy hunting in Ill Omen.  He told me that he had heard a few peeps complaining that my warrior (Huzya) trained them in CoM.  Well.... Get Over It!  I'll be really blunt on this one.  There is a method and code to CoM, and if you screw with it, you're screwed... period.  Now, for those of you who are new to CoM, lemmie enlighten you on how to be a good player there.<br>
<br>
First off, you can camp the zone area from levels 38 through 51.  It's (imo) one of the best xp/lewt zones in the game for these levels.  There are 3 usual camp areas near the zone and they are as follows:<br>
<br>
The Zone:<br>
Easily the best/safest camp spot.  You can pull everything there, and pathing is so screwed up that a good puller can almost always single pull to camp.  There are 2 mobs at the bridge, 3 at the gate, and 2 at each of the 2 ledges.  Note: These mobs are the lowest level in the zone, and the Zone group will usually pull both them and either the Stables or Temple.  This is a common practice. <br>
<br>
The Stables:<br>
Mobs here tend to be a level or 2 higher than the zone area.  The stables are broken up into 2 sections with the camp placed right in between them.  There are 15 total mobs in the stables.  Pulls are almost always 2 mobs, and sometimes 3-4 (they're close togather), so a chanter really helps here.  Most of the wraithbone hammers and Kunzar Ku'juch's that I've seen have come from the stables.<br>
<br>
The Temple:<br>
17 mobs here, and they're a level or 2 higher than the stables.  Best xp camp if you have crowd control.  Otherwise, you need a mid 50s puller, or yer dead.  Pulls are usually 2-3 and they hit fer a ton!  Most of the Green Jade Broadswords and Wu Sticks that I've seen have come from the temple.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now that I've explained the camps, lemmie start on common practices, and common courtesy in this zone...<br>
<br>
If you are camping in either the stables or the temple, it's your basic camp.  Pull mobs, kill mobs, repeat.  The only thing of note here is the stables.  In the stables, the Spectral Courrier spawns from time to time.  He has 2 drops (Illegible Scroll and Student Log) that are needed for Shammy quests.  If one pops, it's good practice to OOC it so that any shammys in the zone can loot it.  <br>
<br>
Even though the zone group is the safest camp spot, it is also the first to become a zoo... and here is where my rant really kicks into high gear...<br>
<br>
First off... etiquette for the camping group.  Yeah, you can park mobs at the bridge and be fairly safe... BUT... doing so restricts the movements of the rest of the zone... so keep it to a minimum, especially when there are a bunch of players in the zone.  Also, you must be aware that there are frequent CoM raids (Reavers, etc).  If you see a raid gathering, make sure to keep the bridge area as clear as possible.  There is nothing worse than heading into the zone for a raid, rounding the corner to the bridge, and running smack into 5-6 parked mobs.  I guarantee you... these mobs quickly wind up right at the zone... and things get ugly.  Of course, a few parks are unavoidable... so make sure to OOC that there is a bridge stack being cleared.  Communication is KEY.<br>
<br>
Now onto etiquitte for peeps at the zone and NOT in the zone group and are not waiting on a raid.  Help out the zone group.  When I am waiting on a group, I assist the zone camp and use the time to work my various weapon skills.  Since I can't KS, I help them kill mobs quicker.  Everyone is happy.  Two things to note though...<br>
<br>
One:  Ask first.  Some groups may not want your help.  I dont see the logic, but hey... it's their group.  Respect it.<br>
<br>
Two: Ask them who their main assist is, and create a Hot Key.  This way, you don't break mezzes.<br>
<br>
Now onto etiquitte for peeps at the zone and NOT in the zone group and ARE waiting on a raid.  If you are on a raid, you are prolly a much higher level than the people camping xp.  This does not give the right to be an inconsiderate jackass.  Period.<br>
<br>
One: STAY THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY OF THE ZONE GROUP!  Sure, a 55 level peep can solo most of the mobs, but the zone group gets xp from the kills... you dont.  You killing a mob solo impresses no one but yourself.  If you are waiting on a raid, stay back out of the way of the group.  Also, don't sit in front of the clerics and casters.  It's just rude.  You wanna do something nice?  Buf the group, or PL them a bit.  It doesn't cost you anything, and it brings good karma.  There are too many jerks in this game as it is.  Try to be nice.<br>
<br>
Two: Communicate with the Zone Group.  If your raid is ready to move out, please show some consideration and dont just march into the zone.  Ask the zone group to clear you a path.  Sure, you can easily do it yourself... but you dont get xp from it.  They do.  If you are in a rush, help them kill the mobs as they are pulled to camp.  This way, everyone wins.  There is no reason not to be a nice player.  I don't care how high a level you are.<br>
<br>
Finally, moving around the zone...<br>
<br>
If there is a zone group, do NOT sit or hang out at the bridge (or the area between the bridge and the zone).  Period.  You are in the way of the zone group's pulls.  Personally, If I see someone hanging at the bridge while I'm pulling, I'll take the time to ask them to go back to the zone (and I always offer to clear a path for them if they are headed deeper into the zone).  If they do not heed my requests/warnings, I just continue to pull as normal... and they wind up getting trained.  Oh well.<br>
<br>
There is only 1 group camped at the zone.  I can't begin to tell you how many times we've setup camp only to have some high level druid or monk waltz in and start farming by pulling to the zone.  It interferres with the pulls of the zone group, and is just damn rude.  There are many zones that are perfect for soloing.  CoM isn't one of them.<br>
<br>
And finally... Trains.  Trains are unavoidable in this zone, mainly due to crappy pathing.  If you train, SHOUT TRAIN!  If you are high enough level to hunt in CoM, then you have no excuse NOT to have a TRAIN hot key programmed.  As with everything else, show some consideration to those around you.  Yelling TRAIN gives the people at the zone time to prepare for it.<br>
<br>
Okies... I guess that's about it for my rant.  The bottome line is simple.  Just be nice.  CoM is a GREAT zone, and can be a lot of fun if everyone communicates with each other... and shows mutual respect.  Otherwise, the zone is a nightmare.<br>

ggan tells you, &quot;will that work&quot;<br>

So he does it. 3 reavers come charging out. We're all scared shitless. We're all blind in seconds. I never even knew what happened. By the time my screen came back on I was in FV. A couple lucky casters with evac hotkeys managed to get parts of their groups out, but it wasn't pretty.

<br>
The zone group gets trained all the time.  It's unavoidable.  If you cant handle the occassional train, then you setup camp elsewhere.  No biggie.<br>
<br>
If someone decides to simply squat down at the bridge while I'm trying to pull to the zone, I ask them to move to a safer place.  If my request is not heeded... oh well.  They get beeotch slapped by the next pull.  But dont whine to me about it.  You were warned... what more do you want? <br>
