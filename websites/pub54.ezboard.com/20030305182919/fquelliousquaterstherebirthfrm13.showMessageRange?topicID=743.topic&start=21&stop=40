[/quote]<br>
<br>
And trivialize the rest of the zones?<br>
<br>
One great part of flagging (and no, I am not flagged yet after about 30 tries) is that it allows people to progress slowly into these new areas.<br>
<br>
Ask the people who are there how long a lvl 46 anything would last if getting beat on, in the flagged areas.<br>
<br>
Take a group of lvl 46's to the 7th island in PoA.  See how much &quot;Fun&quot; you have.<br>
<br>
By slowly progressing into areas, Sony also allows themselves time to correct bugs from all the different ways of killing mobs.  ANY programmer can tell you there are different ways of completing a task.  No one can think of all of them before hand.<br>
<br>
I don't fault Sony for making me get flagged to progress.  I don't fault sony for making me camp 10 shards to get into VT, 4 pieces fro the Emperor's key.  The 2 pieces for Seb, 2 or 3 pieces for Charsis.  It helps keep the game interesting.  Ask the people with 200+ AA's and lvl 65 how bored they get doing the normal exp grind?  How many alt's do you think they got?<br>
<br>
Anything worth anything is worth working for.  If it is handed to you, you won't appreciate it as much. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804">Baron Impudent Blasphemy</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

How is killing difficult mobs, I am not talking mini bosses or god-like mobs having something handed to you?  You see you look right past what I said without understanding it.  Maybe I need to make it clearer. The mobs themselves, and I repeat, not the mini bosses and god-like mobs, force you to be &quot;worthy&quot; enough to be there in the first place.  <br>
<br>
You couldnt kill Ssra Emporer at level 46, not even if you got every level 46 on the server to try it.  And probably not if you got every level 46 on every server to do it.  Same with PoA, you can't do it, you need the levels and other key ingredients that come with the levels to accomplish those things.  Hence, my anger/frustration with having keys to get in.  <br>
<br>
If you need to be this tall to ride the ride, why do you need a key/flag in addition to it to get on if you met the heigth requirements?  <br>
<br>
You see, you arent even playing devils advocate against the point I was trying to make.  Might be my fault, maybe I wasn't clear enough.<br>
<br>
Flags are for countries, not on-line video games...  <br>

It's not about wanting to have anything handed to you nor is it about needing to be in the most uber of uber advanced zones.  It's about the fact that if you miss just one night you can be screwed out of raiding with your guild for an extended period of time.<br>
<br>
Here is the standard progression to reach Mithaniel Marr:<br>
Complete PoJ trial for PoV access.<br>
Kill Aerin Dar in PoV for HoH access.<br>
Complete all 3 trials in HoH for HoHB access.<br>
Kill Mithaniel Marr.<br>
<br>
(Hope that wasn't too much of a spoiler as it's all pretty widely known by now =P).<br>
<br>
Now let's say your guild has 100 members.  Let's also say you have an average attendance of 50 for argument's sake.<br>
<br>
For starters the PoJ trials are one group events on relatively fast respawn times so this isn't a huge issue.  However once you get to Aerin Dar you are talking a full size raid to kill it.  Now if you don't happen to be on the night your guild kills Aerin Dar then you are sol.  If you don't happen to have completed your trial for PoV access then you are sol.  The rest of your guild has demonstrated a clear ability to advance to the next tier however until they come back and kill Aerin Dar a second time you are stuck.  They have to compete with 3-4 other guilds for the spawn as well as make it a priority over other things they could be killing.  Let's say you don't even get another shot at Aerin Dar for 2 weeks due to spawn competition.  Let's say during that 2 week period that your guild is able to win 2/3 HoH trials needed for the next tier.  That is now 3 encounters that you HAVE to be online for or risk missing out on the progression to the next plane.  This applies not only to you but also to the other 50 people that missed the first attempt.  Out of those 50 lets say you get another 30 flagged on your second attempt.  That is still 20 of your guildmates that cannot progress with you until they get flagged from that encounter.  Do you see their frustration?  You almost have to play 6-7 days a week just to keep up and lots of people have other things to do than play EQ (esp with the holiday season and people travelling).<br>
<br>
People raised the point about there being additional ways to get flagged.  That's a nice idea however some of these quests only allow you to advance to the next zone and dont qualify as true flags to advance to zones after that.  Don't know whether that is by design or just poor programming but it really does screw people who do it via quest way down the line.<br>
<br>
They need to fix the quest flag progression and they either need to make it so that the entire guild gets flagged upon completion of a mob or that you get &quot;bonus flags&quot; to distribute to members that missed the encounter.  The system is a good idea but it does need some work.  I'd much rather have to kill challenging mobs that allow entire raids to advance at once rather than camping rare spawns for single shards that the 5 other people in your group also need. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=warlordette>Warlordette</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>F Salta!!!</span><br>  Posts: 305<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/18/02 2:04:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> Im going to agree with you guys and say...wtf is the point in having flags and/or keys at all...<br>
<br>
The zone itself should dictate wether or not you can be there.  If you can zone in and stay alive...you can stay, if you zone in and die...you go away....There is no point in making every damn zoned keyed or flagged....Many of people paid 30 dollars for an expansion that they can only use about 10% of...so either refund them the 27 dollars that they spent that they get nothing for, or unkey the damn zones and let people fend for themselves on wether they should be there or not....<br>
<br>
Im honestly tired of it, and am loosing more and more interest daily in the flags/keys aspect of everquest.  Ive found myself logging in less and less each day....just because it isnt fun anymore....each day that i dont log in i get further and further behind my guild in progression...wich makes it less and less fun....I hate the feeling that i &quot;have&quot; to play nightly for 5 or 6 hours, or i wont keep up with my guild...sure let them raid and kill and get the phat lewts.....but if i log on i want to be able to do the same...not find out im now 15 flags behind, and might get back up on par if i play a straight 80 hours next week.....bullshit...<br>

So if I reread your post correctly....<br>
<br>
You are mad because you had something else to do and could not log on when your guild killed &quot;flag&quot; mobs..?<br>
<br>
In addition to this, you are upset because they are continuing forward in zones and trials while you are still back in teh other zones trying to get yourself flagged (becuase you missed it).<br>
<br>
This makes no sense on a few levels.  <br>
<br>
A guild should care about the content its members can reach.  A guild shuold take the time and effort to help the members reach a similar level as the majority of it's members.  <br>
<br>
However.. If you are in the minority, why should the guild hold up the rest of teh guild to help out a select few?<br>
<br>
While I agree that the rare spawns are a pain in the butt, it is also YOUR responsibility to be there for YOUR guild when they need you.<br>
<br>
It is a two-way street.  You either put forth the effort, or get left behind until the next time your guild can get together to help the rest of you. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804">Baron Impudent Blasphemy</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Some people live in California and may miss the kill of a flag mob since they get off work later.  Some people may have RL things to attend to (not sure if you noticed but lots of people tend to travel and have a lot more stuff to take care of with it being the holiday season and all).  Some people work at places that require them to be on for shifts of 24 hours.<br>
<br>
Most guilds have gone back and killed these mobs 3-4 times to help get all of their members flagged but people will always slip through the cracks.  Hell we've had people show up for flagging events only to have the zone crash on us and lose them in a rollback.  You cannot predict when another guild is gonna show up and beat you to a spawn.  You cannot predict when your boss is gonna have you stay late and finish something up.  You cannot predict when a zone is gonna crash and rollback your chars to lose the night's work.  <br>
<br>
Brudda may very well play 5 nights a week and raid every chance he gets but if he's unlucky and loses out on that one night a week he is stuck.  You are right in that some people just aren't motivated enough to help out their guild and while I don't think you should necessarily award people like that I also don't think hard working guildmates who just happen to be unlucky or pay a little bit more attention to rl should completely miss out.<br>
<br>
I think the best solution would be to assign the raid leader the ability to hand out an extra dozen flags or so.  This way when someone recruits with guild A a month down the road that guild doesn't have to go back and kill Grummus, Aerin Dar, etc etc just to get one or two people up to speed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gimik>Gimik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>This is my cool board name</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/18/02 3:48:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> The point is - Why are people being held back?

<br>
What if you went LD right when the flag mob dies? Cable modem down, I cant get back in now. No flag for me. <br>
<br>
What about when the zone crashes right after you get your flag? Half of you lose your flag.<br>
<br>
Both of these things have happened to me. Maybe you have to experience flags to understand, Imp.<br>
<br>
Flags should be guild-wide.

<br>
If you are grouped with someone who HAS a flag to that zone, it should zone the entire party into the next zone. <br>
<br>
Yeah I know some people say this will bypass content, but hey, the only thing by going back and killing the same mobs over and over again is to block other guilds from trying or making a mob a highly contested mob.<br>
<br>
Lets look 4-6 months in the future from now.<br>
<br>
Lets say Uberguild_01 loses 5 clerics because typical reasons, they lose 3-4 shammys, and perhaps 3 of their main tanks. <br>
<br>
They are raiding the Plane of time, and now recruit 6 clerics, 2 shamans and 2 warriors. They must go BACKWARDS and rekill all the other flag mobs that lower tier guilds are killing. <br>
<br>
It would be equiv to Vis/Lotus/Wraith going back to NTOV every week just to get something, thus blocking newer guilds. <br>
<br>
The only thing that the flag system now does, is force players to give out their station name and passwords to other people so that if they are not online at the time of a flag mob raid, to get them dual boxed or so. Which btw is against verants policies.<br>

<br>
There is reletively little different between missing an AOW kill (no chance to roll for drops) and missing a flag mob kill (no flag).<br>
<br>
Granted, by mising the flag, your kept waiting until your next chance to kill the mob, but thats the same thing with a TON of other mobs in the game.<br>
<br>
I am not trying to &quot;over-simplify&quot; the status.  I am just trying to show a different perspective.<br>
<br>
I DO know about 24 hour shifts.  I do know about staying late to get things done.  And yes, I know about cable drops also.<br>
<br>
The fact is, your grouping yourself with a minor amount of people who openly protest about something.. knowing Sony won't change it.<br>
<br>
Oh, and for the flag issue... try die'ing 3 times to the Exe, only to have ALL the other members of those 3 groups get flagged and move on.<br>
<br>
No sympathy here.  And no sympathy wanted.  It's a game.. deal with it. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804">Baron Impudent Blasphemy</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

It is not like a ton of other mobs in the game.  The only mob in all of Everquest that you can compare any PoP flagging to is Emperor Ssrae.  You needed to kill him to get into VT.  Everything else relied on camping rare mobs with small groups, not full fledged raids.  Verant even planned for this with emp (you'll remember the original rifts were droppable and were only made no drop after people abused the system on player auction etc).   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gimik>Gimik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>This is my cool board name</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/18/02 4:40:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> Imagine that the exe trial is on a 3-day timer... even if someone fails.

<br>
Ubah_Guild_01 kills Velious_DragonX  10000000000 times plus one more, every time it pops, to get keys for ST.  Ubah_Pally_01 in that guild misses one night, misses a mass dragon slaying, so misses getting his ST key, and therefore misses out on the ST fun, and releasing of sleeper/ farming of primals, whatever.<br>
<br>
Soooo, your saying now, that farming Velious_DragonX, or Kunark_DragonX, Emp_SsrasZ or Kael_BossY is different then rekilling something in PoP to get other people flagged? (using farming to mean.. kill multiple, mucho, extremely alot times).<br>
<br>
Am i missing something here?  Dont these flag giving mobs drop loot too?  And before the &quot;flag&quot; system, Ubah Guilds were doing multiple slayings of the same old mobs, but not complaining half as much.<br>
<br>
I understand about the guild being in a new zone the next time you log on, but no different the Dragons to ST, or Emp to VT stuff? eh?<br>
<br>
So why the big deal? I truly dont understand.  Should be the same old thing, get your peeps together, and go back and slay the thing and get your people flagged <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://216.40.249.192/mysmilies/contrib/guus/tong.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gimik>Gimik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>This is my cool board name</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/18/02 4:56:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoP Flagging system rant.

It sucks, read for details. </span><hr size=1> What Gimick said. With previous raid-mob key quests, you'd only miss out on raiding one zone if you weren't keyed, and the guild was going to kill that one mob as much as possible anyways for the loot. Trakanon and VP, Yelinak (the best dragon for loot) and ST, Emperor and VT - these mobs were going to be farmed.<br>
<br>
Now, you have multiple mobs to kill to get &quot;keyed&quot;. You must be online for a Behemoth kill before you attempt the Tallon and Vallon Zek kills, which you also require. If the guild goes and beats VZ and TZ while you're still waiting on Behemoth, then you're even further in the hole as they spend more time in places you can't reach.<br>
<br>
Farming doesn't happen, either, because the loot off mobs like Behemoth is WORSE than the loot one can get in Vex Thal and Ssra. So the guild is killing this mob as few times as possible, and every other guild is also trying to bag the same mob. It all makes for a very ugly situation.<br>

<br>
If Salta, Delores, Warlordette, and myself all AGREE 100% on something (anything!) .....  it's as close to gospel as your gonna get without sharing a room with Jesus.<br>
<br>
<br>
The flag system is a good concept with very very poor execution as it stands now.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to see redundant flags... Kill AD, and all individuals get their personal flags, plus guildleader or officers can flag thier tag.   Having either flag gets you what you need.   If you leave the guild, you lose the 'guild' flags but keep your personal ones  (any personal flags you have that you don't have prereqs for are dormant until you redo prereqs)....<br>
<br>
Easy to write but dunno how buggy that would get in practice.   They need to tweak the system tho... it's rough now.... in 6 months when the big guilds have time for natural attrition to take a toll, it's going to be a major hassle. <p>Gurunt Bangoo &lt;Wraith&gt;<br>

<br>
the example of st was made, with someone missing out on primals because say they didnt get a key in time. id say its more like you missed your st key, and because of that missed another key to the next higher zone, and possibly additionally missed another key in that next zone to the zone above it. at this point you have 3 keys to make up, all of which require a good portion of your guild to return to help with, and all of which are contested spawns. now factor in having to do that for each new recruit you get, each person who was on vacation, and eventually, even the most caring of guilds will cut people loose. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qutsemnie>Qutsemnie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tolapumj wanna-be</span><br>  Posts: 296<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(12/18/02 10:27:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: PoP Flagging system rant.

Then...after we pushed everyone out of EQ, lets release EQ2 and Starwars Galaxies....Then we can cut back on EQ staff, since there are a lot less EQ1 players now, and have the best of both worlds...still selling EQ memberships to those hardcore few (albeit few is a lot in EQ sense) wich would have never left EQ anyway, regardless of other game releases, AND sell the shit outta EQ2 and SWG to all those poor saps who couldnt hack the keys/timesinks/flags, but are still jonsing for a game to play....<br>
<br>
I think its shit, but it works....as example...tonight...Log on hearing that the server was down..ready to do some serious raiding....&quot;whats that?&quot;  &quot;oh?&quot;  &quot;the guild is in the Bastion of Thunder all night??&quot;....&quot;Shit...well, see you tommorrow, im off to find something else to do...&quot; /em looks around on the web to see when SWG or EQ2 is going to be released....<br>

<br>
What I would like to see, where possible, are non-loot versions of some of the flag mobs which will spawn the planar projection when killed. Take Aerin'Dar: one day after he is killed, &quot;A Crystalline Dragon&quot; spawns. Same abilities as Aerin'Dar, it drops no loot but spawns the planar projection when it dies and has a one day respawn. Have the respawn on Aerin'Dar/&quot;A Crystalline Dragon&quot; work the exact same as the respawn on Blood of Ssra/Ssra Blood Golem. That way flagging can happen pretty much whenever the need arises, but the rate of items entering the world remains the same.<br>

I've read that the fix for the HoH trials being so blowable is going on Test this week. Hopefully a few other very blowable flag encounters will also be redesigned.<br>
