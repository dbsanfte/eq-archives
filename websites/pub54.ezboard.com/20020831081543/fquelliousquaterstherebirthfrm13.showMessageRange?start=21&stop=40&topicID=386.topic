<br>
Thanks for the personal slam.  Just to clarify a bit.  The point I was making is that I am familiar with the family and their reputation since I owned a real estate company in Midland and didn't have to depend on someone else's perception of them.  I always try to study the isssues as much as possible when voting for someone and vote for them, not the party, not the fact that he gave his wife a wonderful, slurpy kiss on a platform, making over half of the women decide he must be the right candidate for the job because he loves his wife soooooo much.  To me, it was highly refreshing to see someone with some morals enter the office for a change.<br>
<br>
If you want to attack my views that's certainly your right.  However, I am not a half wit.  I'm a licensed real estate broker, although not practicing.  I was approved by the state to teach any real estate course except law and surveying.  I am currrently a sports journalist for a national magazine.  Last, but not least, I am a member of Mensa and I highly resent being portrayed as a half wit, illiterate moron with three teeth.<br>
<br>
Now, please do go on about who was born with a silver spoon in their mouth since Gore was groomed to be president by his politician father since the day he was born.  No, boys and girls, he isn't the simple farm boy he likes to present himself as.  As for drugs if you seriously believe Clinton and Gore didn't, and don't,  have a drug problem who is living in a fantasy land?<br>
<br>
I never attacked you or anyone else personally, and I won't.  I would appreciate the same courtesy although that is probably a bit much to expect.<br>
<br>
Just a little post script, even though we raise cutting horses and rodeo, yee-haw is for the movies and people who find that a convenient slander towards &quot;them thar half-wit hicks&quot;, and not the working cowboys.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you saw Bush wave at the blind person.  My gosh, what was he thinking?  Waving at someone who made an effort to go to where the president was.  Why on earth would a blind person do that?  He/she couldn't see him.  Perhaps he/she was paying respect to the president and the president was acknowledging their presence.  I'm positive the blind person was the only person in that area.  Surely they wouldn't have been in a crowd of people.  I'm also positive whoever was with the person kept it a secret that the president noticed him/her.  I just can't believe this president.  What is he thinking of?  Doesn't he know blind people have not a clue of what's going on around them.  They're half-wit morons who are never apprised of what's happening.  Oh, wait, I'm the half-wit.<br>

For anyone who thinks Bush is kinda dumb I'd just like to point out that he's the one running one of the largest countries in the world while the people on this board are the ones who spend far too much of their free time playing a video game that doesn't really benefit them at all in rl.  <br>
<br>
If you remember Clinton's testimony you'll remember him stumbling over his words (seemingly he lost the ability to speak and form a coherent sentence for a bit there) but no one considers him to have been a dumb person.  Yet we'll jump right on the current pres cuz he waved at a blind person.  Grats, I'm sure Tats and everyone else in this world has never made a comment about some sort of handicap only to learn someone with that handicap was in the earshot.  It's cool that he's never made that sort of mistake in his life.  Maybe the rest of the people that feel so strongly about politics on this board (especially those who feel so wronged by who our current president is) should quit eq and get up off their asses and actually do something about it beyond crying about things on the message boards.  <br>

<br>
I've also worked for General Powell and met Dick Cheney and they are probably, by far, the most capable leaders out there.<br>
<br>
I have also seen the direct result on the military when Clinton took office, and it scared the @#%$ out of me to say the least.  I wasn't too impressed.<br>
<br>
A great leader surrounds himself with other great leaders - can't remember who said this, but that was what I saw happen when Bush jr. took office.  <br>
<br>
Yes, MANY people like to focus on interest areas such as abortion, etc.  but without a strong national defense defending our rights as US citizens to focus on these issues then all is for not.  For the second we lose our national defense then we lose our rights to choose or even to 'discuss' these issues on a public forum.<br>
<br>
Yes, I lost 26 good friends of mine during my 4 years in the military, but they died for a good cause.  To defend your rights as citizens of the U.S. and it's Allies to have freedom.<br>
<br>
At first, it used to make me furious as to some of the reasons that people supported Clinton/Gore... but after I sat down and thought about it, this was the very reason my friends died.  So you have the choice, whether it's wrong or it's right.<br>
<br>
I only wish that people would educate themselves more before making these choices.  The 'get out the vote' process, brings people in to vote uninformed and voting gets done on a popularity contest versus the issues. <br>

Americans may not always agree on issue or non-issues, but we at least have a right to our opinions.  Freedom is not free, it is bought and paid for by many unknown people who give their lives or a portion of it for our country.<br>
<br>
And for those of you who are interested, go back and watch some news footage of military personal saluting Clinton and Bush.  Notice anything different?  <br>
<br>
Bush may not be right all the time, I've already voiced my displeasure to the White House about some things he's done, but at least he has the respect of the military and maybe even more important, he respects them.  I personally can't imagine Gore or Clinton exiting the chopper to return the salute of a soldier.<br>
<br>
Possibly by pure, dumb luck or something else, I do believe we have the best person for the job in office at the present time.<br>

P.S.  Sorry but you are right, about one more thing too.  &quot;W&quot; will be the Republican Candidate next election, unless something dramatic happens in the mean time.  As for Gore, I think you are wrong.  I think he is to tainted now with Clinton, his last campaign and his wooden speaking style to get a chance.  Clinton gave him a golden oppertunity and he blew it.  No look for a relatively new face from the Democrats next time, who is a Dynamic speaker and can connect to the over all populace of the country, not just his party and a few extreamist {mostly already in his party too}  The independent voters last year proved once again last year, that they and they alone, determine the out come of elections and both parties will will be going after them with both barrel.  Gore has proven he can not get them on his side when the odds are in is favor, no one is going to believe he can pull it off against a popular President sitting in time of war. <p><html>

<br>
Did we know something like this was going to happen waay before it did?  Hell yes.<br>
<br>
Do we think it's going to happen again? Hell yes.<br>
<br>
Is there a way to defend against it? Hell no, although the government does it's best in stopping 99.9% of these actions there is no way plausible to stop them all.  Thats what puts the 'fear' into terrorism.  The only way to stop this would be to kill those who are doing it... along with those who support it.<br>
<br>
Is it something that you can blame a President for? Hell no, it would have happened no matter who was in the Presidency.  And if you believe otherwise, then you have lived safely in America with your eyes closed to the rest of the world for too long.  These events are happening on a daily basis across the world, and have been for years.  It just finally made it home this time.<br>

Bush evidently got a ticket when he was younger about drunk driving that was brought up.  What I did was bring up Ted Kennedy's drunk driving incident.  One night a long time ago he was at a party and drinking.  When he went home, he gave some girl a ride.  On the way home Ted lost control of his car and drove off of a bridge and into some water.  Ted was able to swim to shore, but the girl died in the car.  It was a big deal back in the 50's or 60's, maybe the 70's but I do not think is was then, could be wrong.  Basically what I was doing was responding to the comments about Bush, by bringing up past things that had happened.  Going back to my &quot;Do not throw rocks in a glass house&quot; theme.  Nothing Bush has done even comes close to what past Democrats have done, hence it is to easy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Do not get me wrong the Republicans are no bunch of Saints either, Watergate comes to mind and then Reagan and the over night improvement in the unemployment ratings come to mind off of the bat.

Now you're the one making assumptions, or exaggerations, in no small part due to your loyalties. What may be criminal to me might be morally right for you. Trust me, we don't want to get into that. I'll quote what a friend said without linking the message board: &quot;Politics isn't a science despite the fact that a person can major in 'political science.' There is no best way to handle a situation or conflict when it comes to politics. There is no right or wrong, only right and left. Both can be equally good choices.&quot;<br>
<br>

I could hear groans when Clinton was brought up in the service. It wasn't simply that the guy dodged the draft and left service members with the impression that he was too good to do his time like everyone else, or better yet, get his head blown off in Vietnam. He kept his distance but paraded military officials for the cameras when he wanted to remind everyone who was Chief like a kick in the teeth. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    But</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> he did try one or two assassination attempts on bin Laden after the car bomb attempt on the WTC. He also tried to pass a bill that would've given the government the right to freeze assets but that got shot down almost immediately, and you and I are as much to blame for the lack of foresight and aloofness as much as any president. Bill wasn't simply holding his c ock for two terms. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 7/8/02 3:59:34 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usemidilt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Semidil T</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/8/02 4:23:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=386.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.pacbell.net/johndbr/semidil.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mipp</span><hr size=1> Sorry Esmalyn,<br>
<br>
You are going to have to edify my a little here.  Whereas you are correct on your political statement, there was no politics in that part of my statement or what I was responding to.  Are you attempting to justify W's or Kennedy's drunk driving?  That is disgusting.  Yes in politics you have gray areas of diffrent views, none are correct and none are incorrect, just diffrent methods of dealing with situations.  <br>
<br>
But criminal behavior is criminal behavior and is wrong no matter how you twist it.  If you think you can come up with something that W's has done wrong like that, that you think I can not respond to, please post it.  Cause I am positive I can respond in kind and then some.  <br>
<br>
This is clasic fueding, you bring up something from last week, I bring up something from last month, you respond with something that happened last year, I rebut with something last decade and so on and so on and so on.<br>
<br>
You can not win in this.  I am defending a individual, you are trying to defend a entire party.  Sorry, but you are putting yourself in a impossible position. <p><html>
