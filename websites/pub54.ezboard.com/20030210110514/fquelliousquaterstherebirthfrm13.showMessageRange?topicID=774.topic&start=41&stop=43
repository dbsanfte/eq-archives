I didnt even know about this board till I came here to say good bye to Mcpally the other day and I thought I would come back just to see what all it had on it....and look what I find.  <br>
<br>
I would just like the opportunity to say a little bit, sense I was the one playing the monk that &quot;trained ORQ&quot;.  Let me enlighten you folks that dont play monks, on exactly how I ended up in your camp and appeared FD ok.<br>
<br>
I was pulling from the opposite hall from yall spliting in the main room.  I was in the middle of a pull where I had 2 mobs aggroed on me, I think one was a white dragon and one was a raptor.  I get out to the main room ready to FD and the White dragon is chain casing on me as the raptor is proceeding to beat the living crap out of me.  I try to FD once, but mis-time the nuke, FD fails /mend!  Hps dropping fast now both meleeing on me oh smack! ORQ mob summons cause you are 20% hp (FD pops back up)!  FD again!  Nuked on Fails again!  Now ORQ has 2 adds cause Monkey RIPS!  Now I dont know if you can comprehend this.......but anyone with common sense would realize hey crap happens and maybe there wasnt much I could have done to prevent this.<br>
<br>
As far as the door opening, there was a couple people not in ORQ or AoV that were hanging around trying to get on a pick up group..... and I know for a fact that some big SK troll said in OOC that he was sorry it was him that go the aggro and got KoS mobs running all over the dang place.  Another time I saw someone drag a corpse to close to the door...SMART ONE mobs outside aggro and hence people evac and run for their lives ect. ect.  <br>
<br>
As  far as Sindails shouts are concerned I will be the first one to say he is a little fast on the trigger and his emotions are some what unbalanced at times, but if I had to pick any druid to be in my group.... as far as game play I would say he has 90% of the druids on this server beat any day of the week.  I know he has rubbed people wrong at times and I can see why, but if you let that get to you maybe you shouldnt be playing the game...oh what was that **GAME** thats right I think most people forget and take things to serious sometimes.<br>
<br>
I apologize for getting your raid wiped out, and if you dont want to believe me that is fine.  There are some people that you know you just cant please and are hell bent on holding grudges that is cool if it makes them happy, or feel like they have purpose so be it.  <br>
<br>
I have been on this server sense beta and I feel I have made many good friends that have even moved into RL friends.  I am sure there are people that dont like me cause I may have made a mistake in the past who knows how many years I have been playing, thats fine it happens.  I know one thing is for sure I am not going to let small things like this get me down it is just a game and we are here to have fun if we cant have fun playing we should maybe go buy a PS2 and play a game that isnt multiplayer interactive so we can only get mad at the programers or ourselves.<br>
<br>
Anyway I just wanted to state my side of the story and just because I hate being talked about behind my back like that if you knew my name and questioned what happened why the heck didnt you send me a tell when it happened so I could explain??????  Oh well I dont know you, and you dont know me and if you want to jump to conclusions you wont ever get to know me.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :moon --><img src=http://www.quellious-collective.com/emoticons/moon.gif ALT=":moon"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=555856" target="top">Bishopp De'Vinne's Barney Suit</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bishoppdevinne>Bishopp DeVinne</A> at: 1/29/03 11:19:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mcpally>Mcpally</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Bok Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(1/29/03 5:22:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=774.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *BEWARE* Asylum of Vengance</span><hr size=1> For thos of you that have been following the board, yes I have returned mostly in part to post's here and at the request of several friends.  Ty for your kind words and support.  <br>
<br>
The fall out in AoV from this event was almost total.  Even though it was all mostly uninformed speculation, misunderstandings, and general jump to conclusions, it brought out some underlying issues within the guild that had appearantly been festering and had gone unnoticed.  <br>
<br>
The post I add here now was meant to stay within the guild to help bolster a new era in rebuilding, I share this with you for the sole purpose of understanding and compassion on your part to see where we are now and what we now face as a guild.  Do not judge us on actions past regardless of what others say but rather on where we go from here.  TY for you time, hope you enjoy the read.<br>
<br>
State of the Guild Address!<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 As many of you will notice, the board seems a little sparse on content. I have taken the time to delete all the negative post's and all the post's asking what's going on. This was done to usher in a new era of positive thinking on the part of all members, instead of focusing on what has transpired in the past few months. Bish, when you get the time, make a retired section so that we can honor those of our valued members are not forgotten nor their role trivialized by hard feelings for actions in the past.<br>
<br>
As to our current state, we are in transition as can be clearly seen by all. Gone is the time for grouping outside the guild unless no one else is on. Gone is the time for hard feelings because someone left. Gone is the time to sit doing nothing complaining or asking what now. Now is the time to act and act as one voice we shall!<br>
<br>
We are currently shorty in numbers in many ways. We need clerics, chanters, rangers, rogues, wizzards, shammies, beastlords, mage's, SK's, pally's, bards. In short ALL class's are open for recruitment. For the time being twinks again will be totally frowned upon. This is your game and your game time to do with as you please, but I am asking for a commitment from all of you that if you can not 2 box, please refrain from playing a twink no matter the situation. Twinks will not rebuild the guild. Cooperation and communication will. When looking at someone to join the guild, its all fair game. You know the over all attitude of the guild and what we look for in a member. If you do not, then ask. Invite at will all willing to take the tag. We can weed out from there. Regardless of anything, a good attitude and willingness to learn will be kept over a bad attitude and huge game knowledge. Id rather take the time teaching someone the game and how to play than to spend the time in tell hell because someone can not control their actions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh Brell, we come to you in time of great need. We come to you not as individuals, but as a group, an entity, a family, seeking your guidance. There is a dragon among us, one that has great power born not of the natural creation of Norrath, but born from our own minds.<br>
This dragon is the spawn of our fears, our uncertainties, our doubts in the goodness of others. He has taken several of our family from us in a most brutal way never to be heard from again. Others he has lead astray with the promise of a greener pasture in another existence. We have fallen pray to our own creation.<br>
We ask of you now for the power and the strength that only the gods themselves posses to help us rise above this terrible dragon and to forge on in a new era of cooperation, understanding, and communication. Lead us down the path of glory oh great and might Brell, show us the faith and direction we will need to posess in order to slay this dragon of ill intent. Let it be known to all that we shall not fall, we shall not die, we shall rise like the Phoenix from the ash's and capture the place in the history of Norrath that we so rightly deserve. <br>
Give me the strength and the wisdom to guild our family down the path of righteousness. To do the right thing to ourselves and to our fellow citizens of Norrath. Help me oh Brell to stand tall and strong in the face of adversity and accusation to stare down the overwhelming obstacles that will lye in our path and lead on to victory. Help us Brell, to become again what we once were. A family.<br>
