That posts reeks of &quot;trying to be like Furor&quot; in either case, why try to dig up some old crap. Sounds like a few still have scabs on their wounds, no reason to reopen them up before they're completely healed. All you would end up doing is making yourself look like an ass, and I know you dont quite fit into that category. If you say you dont care what anybody else thinks, cept those in the alliance or whatever, then let me remind you to consider those who you slander, also have feelings. <br>

I don't want to be Furor, I don't want to run the flame boards, I don't read noows or FoH on any regular basis. Keep all that wack weak reference garbage to yourself. This whole thing started because she wanted to reference one thing to another, and you're propogating the same brainless tactic.<br>

Yes, I'm calling Ari a bitch. She wanted to know what I thought of her bitch routine, i'm letting her know.<br>

Because this flame has nothing to do with that situation. If you go back and read the ADD vs SoTU thread you'll see that I never posted my opinion even then on the situation.<br>

You obviously misunderstood what I was trying to say because I had no desire to drudge up old issues.   You came to your guild's defense, I do not blame you.  I will not state what I think of your guild, there's an endless thread about that.   However, you threatened me with retribution and ended your post with sarcasm, asking me how I liked your nice guy routine.   I didn't think you were being nice actually.  And I think you really made yourself look like a dick now.  Did you think I wouldn't respond?  No hon, you were counting on it so you could have your chance to flame me.   You read more into my post than was intended.  I can't apologize for that.<br>
<br>
As to me referring to myself as a bitch, well...after being a smart ass back to you, I felt like a bitch.   I won't meekly stand by with my thumb up my ass while @#%$ goes on around me.  I express what I think.....no pretenses, no excuses, no shyness and definitely no deceit.  You don't want to hear my opinion, don't come to the board or read my posts.  You disagree with my post, flame back *shrug*.<br>
<br>
If you consider this retribution, you need to take lessons hon.  Think I'll lose sleep over your opinion of me.....muhahaha, you overrate your self worth.   You have never grouped with me.  You have never guilded with me.  You don't know @#%$ about me.   My friends know me...that is all that matters.<br>
<br>
And as to those that come to my defense, I haven't asked a single person to.  I'm a big girl, I say what I think and I sure can handle the slack that I get from it.  <br>
<br>
I do beg you not to steal my moss snakes, my beastlord still needs the scales for buffs I think.  She'd be totally devastated to lose her and the cubby's buffs.<br>

<br>
You said you were awaiting my reply, I responded.  You then ponder why I would find it necessary to respond ...doh.   My so called infraction...I stated my opinion in an open forum over an incident, and yes I was there for Ragefire.   What do you want... me to state that SotU was COMPLETELY in the right?  You will not change my mind about what happened,  there are VI rules and just plain common courtesy.   I was stunned to see that ADD would follow Radiant into Fear and to the temple.   It reminded me of what happened, as I'm sure it reminded other people.<br>

Now, if your skin is so thin that you can't tolerate a referral to the Ragefire incident, maybe there's a reason why you are so touchy about it.

Does that come with the uber mentality...the I'm-so-great-you-should-worship-me-and-I-belong-to-an-uber-guild attitude?   I'm not worried about what you intend to do to me.  I am flattered that you deem me so important that you will be devoting your time to constructing some evil plot against me...muhahahah.   If you think that this was a public humiliation, it wasn't.  I am proud of the fact that I express my opinion on topics that having bearing on our community instead of standing idly by and accept bad behavior.   Like I said, my friends know me, what you think of me will not lower their opinion....well, not of ME anyway.<br>
<br>
Other than the Ragefire incident, I have started maybe two flame posts...one over how I hate EC and trading and the other over how people want to use chat channels.   I tried to add a sense of humor to them even if the incidents irritated me.   So if that makes me a mud slinging bitch...so be it.  Just wondering hon, what does that make you?   I always thought that my comments were rather mild compared to others, but I shall try harder to make my post meaningful.<br>
<br>
You and I can banter back and forth but it will lead to nowhere.   I'm sorry that you were so offended by my opinions and comments, I already said that my post regarding the ADD/Radiant thread was NOT intended to cast stones on your guild, but you chose not to accept that.  You threatened me, maybe if I was less argumentative I could allow it to slide but I would rather defend myself.<br>
 <br>
I think you're an immature ranting idiot who can't handle criticism.  Can't take the flame...don't post the post.<br>

Where have I claimed I was 'uber' or that I was part of an 'uber' guild? When did I ask you to say that my guild was in the right? When did you become qualified to tell me how I am representing myself? (this goes for Val too ;-) How many times have I said this thread is not retribution?<br>

I fear I've underestimated you. You don't just sling the mud, you CREATE the mud! Learn something new every day.<br>

<br>
what am i missing here, you ASK her to respond, then flame her for doing so? your asking someone to do something ... just so you can flame them for doing it right after? pretty damn stupid if you ask me.<br>
<br>
As for Ari, i dont know her in game, but she has earned my respect from what she posts on the boards, and you, Daugrim(sp), you dont get any, you pointless flame her, cause either your an idiot, or you cant read, wait, that means your an idiot.<br>
