<br>
That is a non sequitor. I would be in favor of, and offer support to, any civilized and organized method of killing epic mobs of any flavor. There isn't, as yet, enough competition to force this, so it hasn't been done. But it could be, and I think it would be a good idea, in priciple.<br>
<br>
Rage is the slowest spawn and most contensted piece for the most important epic to any guild, whether they actively engage in it's acquisition, or expect new recruits to already have it, they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> depend</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on it regardless.<br>
<br>
If Rage went FFA it is far too easy now, for some guilds to monopolize the spawn with a trivial amount of effort. They would be irresponsible if they did NOT do so, to protect the interest of their clerics.<br>
<br>
It would not be wrong for those guilds to do so. FFA is FFA, if the clerics want FFA then they can live with their choice.<br>
<br>
Now.. Jlail:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have seen no evidence (although I am sure it is in another thread somewhere) to repudiate any of the following: that non main characters are on the list, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I would hope this is not the case. However, going FFA would do nothing to address this issue, and further make it much more likely that non mains would take Rage spawns.<br>
<br>
[/quote]that certain guilds seem to be overly represented on the list, [/quote]<br>
<br>
This is a valid point. I have suggested that this be addressed, but the best you guys (the clerics) have come up with is no consecutive clerics from the same guild. Personally I don't think that is enough, and there should be a limit per guild. On thinking of it maybe something like one slot per guild + one slot per 5 epicless 51+ cleric they have guilded. Or something. But it's not my call.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that getting on the list is a political exercise, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Welcome to 'the vision' ;P Limited spawns per server means this will be polotical. Guilds are political. EQ is politcal. Don't mean to sound harsh but get ofver it and move on, it's the game you are playing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that no consideration is given for having completed other steps of the epic, <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I totally agree with this. But the issue of verification came up, and it is valid. I thought that displaying the Ix staff would be good, but S pointed out (basically) that a cleric would have to know ahead of time not to turn it in for the orb. I think something along these lines is good, but how to verify?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> that stacking of friends and guildmates on the list has been perpetrated by those that control it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There may be some truth to this. It's human nature to help your friends. But you can't change it from the outside. Join up and lobby for some tweaks.<br>
<br>
Jlail, the thing is, without the list GS will not be getting many epics. At least not for free. High AA toons and luclin gear means it is very easy for some guilds to get these mobs if they want. I doubt VM or LC would care, but there are others that would. And they don't need to send many people. I don't see how a guild like GS, who I have great respect for, will be able to compete in a FFA system.<br>
<br>
I think the cleric list needs to address the concerns you have, but I don't think doing away with it is a good idea.<br>

<br>
Brazzo, I like some of your ideas. there is enough competition that some standards for being enlisted merit being put in place.<br>
<br>
To be honest I think high level clerics should have preference over lower. A 51 is possibly a pl'ed twink. A 60 is not and has proven they play a lot and are less likely to quit after being epified.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If we know he popped (and make no mistake, the big guilds would know if it was in their best interests), what are the odds you are getting your piece from Rage that day, assuming we decide we want to take him?

<br>
Bingo. Exactly right. And will happen. And is much easier to happen now. If the list goes away guilds like DB and GS will be sad. Really these people should be on the same side.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> With the list we are sorta guaranteed that Rage won't be ganked or that we are forced to roll on the spawn and wasting 2 weeks. - Tiqua<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You won't get ganked. There is lots of support for the sitting cleric. Most burners will drop what they are doing to come help. Four or five burners who can be there in seconds grouped with your cleric == no ganking.<br>
<br>
But this very support is why the keepers of the list have to be a little proactive in being responsive to issues with the list. As it stands now it would be almost impossible for anyone but the big guys to gank Rage. But that doesn't mean they should be complacent or cocky.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The system is doomed to fail with this unyielding attitude from those who manage the list. Period. - Desi<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I suspect you may be right in that. I think they need to be in some ways more restrictive and also more responsive to complaints. I don't know Mlain, and I came and helped kill his Rage, but if he's as bad as everyone says I don't think some rules in place to mitigate situations like that would be bad.<br>
<br>
Here's the thing. When the list was short, it didn't seem reasonable to have any prerequisites to getting listed. Despite some people with the foresight (*cough*) suggested there be some criteria.<br>
<br>
Now the list is WAY long and will only get longer. If it gets TOO long it may even be necessary to cut the list short, which I think most listed clerics won't like. There needs to be some fair restrictions. Yes level is fair. Yes quota per guild is fair. Yes being LP is fair.<br>
<br>
Suggestions.<br>
<br>
(1) Level limit for new clerics being added. I'd say mid fifties. 56 sounds good to me. I think 51 is too low.<br>
<br>
(2) Have the persons <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> guildleader</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> vouch that they are LP. That's pretty close to proof.<br>
<br>
(3) Have only X per guild on the list with one more allowed per Y un epiced clerics in that guild of at least the level set in (1).<br>
<br>
These are my ideas. Others have been suggested.<br>
<br>
I also like the idea of occasional FFA spawns.<br>
<br>
It will be painful if the listed clerics are not grandfathered, howerver if something is not done about holding it down soon a more major reorganization may have to take place.. IE everyone after 10 removed and lotto for the next 5. That would be bad IMO.<br>
<br>
Keep this in mind. The rules must be agreed to by the clerics, but the system must be supported by the community. If the rules are not seen to be fair the community will stop supporting it. If the list is seen to be too long gank attempts will occur. It's a tricky tightrope to walk, and I would not want to walk it myself, but the list keepers signed on for the job and it's their responsibility to walk it.<br>
<br>
A civilized system is preferable, but you can't take it for granted either.<br>

Post up the list of names and numbers, and then do the random in SF with however many witnesses you want.  Whatever number wins gets the next spot.<br>

As some one else posted, the cleric would need to wait the same amount of time even without the list, considering how many times he/she will be KSed and/or the mob despawns. With the list, things are more organized and laid back. I know at least 5 or 6 clerics on the list. Some ranging from next on list to 40th in line. To destroy the list and start everything over is an enormous mistake in my opinion. Forget about who is deserving, who can burn RF faster, or the &quot;calm&quot; aspect of it; by destroying the list you're simply playing with people's minds! Just imagine how frustrating it is to be in the next 10 in line to camp RF and then have the entire thing ganked right out of your hands. It's just as bad as KSing. <br>
<br>
SOLUTION: I think any one and every one who actually CARES about doing the cleric epic with their guild and wants to either rid the list, or keep the list, should all petition to VI to make OTHER dragons drop the piece rage drops. that's the only civilized way of handling this in my opinion. Should the list be destroyed, there will be hundreds of chaotic rivalries and our server will be DISGUSTING!<br>

Interesting - it does solve the problem of When to Random.  <br>
<br>
It doesn't solve the problem of the perpetual loser(s) that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> make it onto the top N spots.   Given that all have an equal chance at making it in, it MAY suffice to pass Verant's inspection.<br>
<br>
Of course, given that you're rolling from a list, the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> other</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> objections some have voiced are still not addressed:<br>
--Difficulties getting on the list - but I have issues with anyone have troubles here and this needs to be clear and equitable.<br>
--Restricting who should be on the list based on level, alt/main status, and how much of the rest of the quest is completed.   I doubt that those who complain about one or the other of these are willing to &quot;let it go&quot;.  IMO, adding any restriction beyond what Verant's implemented (you must be a cleric level (51+) to do the quest) risks Verant saying that the system is invalid.<br>
<br>
If all that Verant wants to include are included and none that Verant wants to include are excluded, and all those included have an EVEN chance... it might pass muster.<br>

SONY owns everquest.  Sony making lines may or may not be fair, but it's Sony's game so Sony can make lines.  They actually do if you pay $40 a month, but us ghetto-EQ players aren't so lucky.<br>
<br>
This list telling a cleric to wait behind 40 others is no differnent, AT ALL, from me telling you to wait for 40 severilouses before you gank another one.   It's the same thing.  I can threaten you if you don't just like some folks like to on the list.  I can tell you how you don't understand being a non-warrior what Severilous means just like some folks like to on the list.  It's the same thing.  I can get a warrior thread going and get them to line up 40 strong yadda yadda.  <br>
<br>
The only difference here is the warrior epic is (properly for being 2 expansions ago) outdated and the cleric epic isn't.  It's about loot.   <br>

As for keeping the list small and randoming... it solves the biggest problems in both FFA and the list.. keeps the list from getting out of control, and keeps the fighting to a minimum.  It requires a little more work than the list for a cleric to join, but less work than FFA for a cleric to reserve and hold  a spawn in FFA.   Even that can easily break down when somebody doesn't want to roll or decides they lost x number of rolls and deserves it more than the other guy.<br>
<br>
It only takes one person/guild to break any system.  A system survives by being as flexible and fair as possible.   Trying to maintain a 40-and-growing list is patently unfair to anyone trying to join in late....only a handfull of the clerics ahead are actually there to make claim.<br>
<br>
Ragefire sucks.... no system is gonna not upset somebody if they *expect* their epic in any kind of timely fasion.   <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

Still the question is WHY?<br>
<br>
I don't understand.<br>
<br>
Yes a line means someone has to wait. Thanks for letting us know<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The point that you fail to demonstrate, because I think it cannot be demonstrated, is that it is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> unfair</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
It makes no sense. In any queue someone got there first. <br>
<br>
When I go to the movies it is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> unfair</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that someone is in front of me?<br>
<br>
I mean, there's no LAW that I have to wait in line.. so why should I?<br>
<br>
In point of fact it is eminently fair that the first person to get in line have priority over the second. There is nothing more fair.<br>
<br>
Now people at the end don't LIKE it. But that doesn't make it unfair.<br>
<br>
It would also be fair if Rage went FFA again.<br>
<br>
This isn't fair vs unfair.<br>
<br>
This isn't about how many clerics get epics. The same will get them regardless.<br>
<br>
This is about being civilized or not. About minimizing strife or maximizing it. And ultimately this is about the big guilds like VM and LC giving the smaller ones a shot. Because it would be EASY for them to monopolize the spawn, if it went FFA.<br>
<br>
The big guys let this happen because, I suspect, partly they don't want to be bothered with getting clerics epics, and partly they are past this content so it makes them feel generous to ALLOW others to do something like this, and partly they don't see any angle in looking like bullies over something that isn't making or breaking their guilds.<br>
<br>
But it IS generosity make no bones about it.<br>
<br>
This only is possible because they allow it.<br>
<br>
In a very real sense they are tossing the rest of Quellious a bone. It's up to the clerics to decide whether they want to kill each other over it or try to have some system to share.<br>
<br>
But keep in mind if they fight over it, the big guys will probably eventually say screw it they are fucking it up. We tried to do the right thing and those morons just squabble. Forget the whole thing.<br>
<br>
It is my hypothesis that most people that play a cleric to the level that this is an issue are the sort of people that like to do things civililzed, even if it means waiting their turn.<br>
<br>
But hell do what you like. If it goes FFA again that's all the better for me. Do you think I'll cry if Rage goes FFA like Sev/Tal/Gore? Heh.<br>
<br>
I prefer order, but damn straight I can play the chaos game too.<br>
<br>
I would ask any cleric to seriously consider their chances of getting their epic at all if it goes FFA.<br>

Get on the list. Help out your fellow clerics when you can. Tell people about it in case they may not have heard so they know to get listed too.<br>
<br>
Certainly I think some reforms may be in order, but unless the list becomes perspicuously abusive I suspect it won't be going anywhere.<br>
<br>
Because I suspect, most clerics are like you and don't want the strife, conflict and hard feelings associated with it being free for all.<br>

<br>
That's what you meant right?  Or was your example completely non sequitor to the Ragefire list?  <br>
<br>
Again.. #39 only deserves ragefire over #40 because listees will threaten those that disagree.  Neither have put time in, nor will put time in for months.   It's not a line at all, it's a reservation system spread ridiculously far out.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with people there NOW camping Rage NOW.   A short list is easy to handle, as if it's a few long those few can all share the burden... when you stretch it out 30 long... it can be nice to have a reservation but it's obvious the demand way outstrips the supply... the list grows faster than it can churn out Ragefires.... it cannot work if it just continues to bloat.   A cleric can be born today, run out to skyfire (thanks lvl 10 safety net) get on the list, level up and still have time to kill before his ragefire turn.  <br>
<br>
Mlain damn well deserved his epic peice.  That's the list.  The second you say no to anyone, for any reason, you are policing and monopolizing.  <br>
<br>
With a short list and /random.. yes you can be unlucky.. but you also know anyone on the short list is actively working on it... and anyone on that list will get it done within a month or two.   You don't have someone put off because they have to wait 6 months+ for sure, they have a chance.  It's easy to track a handfull of people.  <br>
<br>
What happens if someone can't make thier turn 6 months down the road?  Are they just skipped?  Can they trade thier turn with someone else?  Are the reserved the next spot after indefinitely until they are capable of the camp?<br>
<br>
It's simple math.. if you add 3-5 clerics for every ragefire, the system will break eventually.   <br>

After a half dozen or so rage pops I think the number of clerics sitting there would become reasonable.<br>
<br>
I think that clerics already completed everything but Rage should be the only ones being considered for rage. (The current system is flawed in this respect)<br>
<br>
I respect the list but am wise enough to see that its no longer realistic or applicable to a game as dynamic in nature as EQ is.  The game, the people, the loyalties change too dramatically to plan 6months? a year? ahead.<br>
<br>
I think the intelligence and civility displayed under the &quot;list&quot; system is what should be built upon for a new system, not a desperate grip on a now failing system.<br>

<br>
Or IOW.. Huh?<br>
<br>
Where I THINK you were trying to go with this is how it might be wrong somehow for me to call in my ticket order. And expect to have my ticket over someone who went to the ticket booth before the show.<br>
<br>
But in point of fact I can do that very thing, whether for a movie, or for a concert, or for a football game.<br>
<br>
The RF system requires someone to show up 'in person' to get on the list but that's more restricted than lists and lines generally are. I call and buy what I like to call 'a ticket' or make what I like to call 'an appointment' or get what I like to call 'a reservation' and then I *expect* to show up at the given time and accomplish whatever it is I set out to.<br>
<br>
And as happens this is pretty much the universally accepted way to resolve all resource conflicts.<br>
<br>
It's civilized.<br>
<br>
No I don't LIKE to be told by the nurse that the doctor cannot see me for two weeks, but there it is. Somoene else had some pain two weeks ago and THEY waited THEIR turn. It would border on sociopathic for me to think I deserve to go ahead merely because I only see my personal situation and cannot see that there are others who have abided the same rules and waited in pain just like I have to.<br>
<br>
Now if there are no rules then I'll bring a gun to the doctors office and shoot everyone ahead of me.. and expect other people to shoot back.<br>
<br>
That would be fair in a sense too. The most accurate and fastest shot <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> fairly</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> gets access to the limited resource, in this case, the physician.<br>
<br>
But that's generally not viewed as a terribly good way to allocate resources. It's called anarchy and only multiply pierced 18 year olds wearing black think it's a terribly good idea. And they grow out of it quick when they realize in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> true</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> anarchy they would be the very <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> lowest</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on the food chain.<br>

Take the lines at the cafateria in school.  Just cause someone got in line first doesnt mean they 'deserve' the food more than a person farther back in line.<br>
<br>
Now if  person x started at the back of the line and has been waiting say 10 mins to get up to the front and person y just arrived and is at the back of the line do I think person y should be able to go to the front and get their food first?  No.  Person x has been waiting patiently and civilly for their turn.  Person y shouldnt be able to get theirs first by being noisy, cutting in line, and making the whole thing into a fistfight.<br>
<br>
You could also use the example of a supermarket or the line at EBX.  verant just made only ONE cash register so to speak.<br>
<br>
IMO its basically either being civil, respecting one another, and keeping a line going which has worked up until this time and someone being pissy cause they most likely werent ready at the time to get on the list, OR we can just start throwing fists and bringing in our 'big siblings' to enforce our 'right' to something.  Which do you think is more mature?  The list was given and explained to every cleric that came to SF (meaning they were ready and wanted to start campig Rage) and they could be added to the list.  This means the clerics who didnt know about the list were ones who 1) Didnt come to SF cause they were not ready to camp rage yet or  2) Didnt talk to the clerics already there waiting who knew about the list.<br>
<br>
As Ive said before either way you go people going to be left out and waiting 6 - 12 months for rage ANYWAY because only a specific number will spawn.  One way (FFA) benefits clerics in larger guilds and being able to race to a mob faster, which in no way denotes them being more deserving.  The other way (list) benefits clerics who are willing to talk to other clerics and willing to work towards their epic civilly along with the rest of the servers clerics in a mature fashion.  Which, in my mind at least, makes them more deserving because they are being responsible and respecting other people instead of just walking all over them.<br>
<br>
Might makes right (or speed and lots of friends), or respecting your fellow Quellious clerics?<br>
<br>

Ok, here is the problem with cafeteria lines and move lines VS the current ragefire list.<br>
<br>
<br>
I get in line for a movie.. I'm 3rd.  I wait for the 2 ppl ahead of me to buy their ticket, then attempt to move up to the register.<br>
<br>
A group of 20 ppl run up and tell me to stop. Their friends (the 2 ppl that were ahead of me) are with them so they all should get their tickets now... oh, and they hae 20 more ppl still finding parking, would I please back up and get in line properly at number 41.<br>
<br>
I say.. well, I was here now and that ticket-seller over there will sell me a ticket now if I take 2 steps and hand him my money.<br>
<br>
I'm told that I'm greedy, and if I do that they will throw popcorn at me and spill soda on my seat and make the movie as horrible as possible if I don't respect the line.<br>
<br>
<br>
The issue isn't that there is a line, it's that there is a line that would stretch a block and a half of people that mostly aren't there.  Obviously having 41-and-counting clerics all trying to hold their spots in game is ludicrous, because the line keeps growing, and growing... it's inevitably going to break.   It's not set up to last.  <br>
<br>
Ragefire is a wait, it sucks.. why should one person have to wait 2 months to do the shitty camp when another has to wait 6 months.... if they are both willing to put the time in after the current camper is done?    The list doesn't work because it grows much faster than it can supply Ragefires.  The list cannot work if you refuse people, telling someone &quot;no&quot; is inviting them to break the list.  You can't get upset at someone you are blacklisting if they break the list they are not allowed to use.  <br>
<br>
It's math and logistics.. the current system is going to break itself.  It's not a matter of greed or good-guy/bad-guy stuff.... the list-breaker is no more a bad guy than the list telling him to wait almost a year to even try for his epic.    <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

It had those who were there first on the list first.  Just like any line at a movie theatre would.  But unfort instead of opening another register Verant leaves only one open.  This leads to some people deciding to try and get some order into the mass and pushing of a crowd of people trying to get to the ticket counter first into a civil and responsible line.<br>
<br>
There is only one line.  there isnt a second ticket counter to go move to (ie another mob to go camp).  Jumping on Rage with a respectable line of clerics waiting and respecting one another is like cutting in line past people..  Not moving to another ticket window <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143487">

<br>
I still think the list is unfair (in that only those folks who heard about it from friends and guildmembers knew about it).<br>
<br>
I still think that it is absurd that people think they can &quot;call&quot; a spawn 9 months ahead of time.<br>
<br>
I still think it is laughable that people think they can threaten people with repercussions if they deviate from the list.<br>
<br>
I don't see a better solution.<br>
<br>
I would like to see a randomisation of the numbers, announced to be done on October 1st.  Get all the clerics on the list to agree to it.  Get all the clerics on the list who watn to be.  Do the random.  Go on.  First 5 people on the list stay within the first 5.<br>

Next - you dont have a six month waiting list at a cafeteria line with some jerkoff saying you need to proove your worthyness of getting in the line in the first place - please fuck off with that garbage.<br>
