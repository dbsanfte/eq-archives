And how is this different? You get stuff for your self and for your guildmates.. hmm.. that's what I do and most burners I know do. I'm missing something. So it's ok for you to help your guildmates but not anyone else.. so 'farming' is what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  other</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> people do.. yes now it's all clear to me.<br>

<br>
Montyy if you catch the one you need to burn up, I will be happy to help. I'm sure any burner you ask would be if you don't have enough RiP burners online. I didn't know you needed it.<br>
<br>
But I am sure you would be to proud to ask a burner.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I find it aggitating that a small percentage of people are using an easy AA ability ..<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

If it was so easy why such a small percentage? I'm sorry thats a crapload of XP.<br>

<br>
Would they? I may be vocal here but I am not even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  close</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to the most prolific dragon burner. I've been active the past couple weeks because I've been sitting around skyfire like a lump helping camp rage, so I haven't been busy. But months have gone by where I haven't burned anything.<br>
<br>
But hell yes burning dragons is a blast, no pun intended.<br>
<br>

<br>
'third time' huh?<br>
<br>
Want to get personal then get personal Montyy. But even if I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on a crusade to get epics for my guildmate, I'm still missing the part where that's a bad thing.<br>
<br>
For that matter lets not even go there... so you can better understand it... yes great idea, at Montyy's recommendation I am now on a crusade to get people their epic drops. If you are in a small guild or in a guild that doesn't have enough ppl on atm or otherwise cannot get troops to kill the mob you need, if you camp it, or catch it up send me a tell (or probably most burners that aren't in a raid zone) and I'll try to get other burners to come kill it for you.<br>
<br>
This whole thing is so lame. Soon enough most guilds will have in house burn teams and it will just be competition between them.. and I am sitting here asking myself.. why are we burners being so nice? Will RiP burners back down if some other guild wants to have a 'traditional' raid?<br>
<br>
I am sure you are probably laughing quite hard at that idea.<br>
<br>
Montyy, I do thank you for making me thing about this some more. This bears a lot of thought. I am thinking now that burners may be being big huge shmucks for trying to take the high road right now. I doubt anyone whining right now would do the same thing in return.<br>
<br>
I have refused to take money for epic drops when it was offerred. I and most burners have given lots of them away. Some may have been sold but not by me or the people I know. But I'm starting to think we are being <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  morons</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for doing that. I mean look how <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  well</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you speak of us now.<br>
<br>
This bears a lot of thought. Thanks Montyy.<br>

NtoV dragons are 100k+ that have butt loads of regular drakes around them (not to mention those damn flurry drakes&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
You're farming no matter how you try to sugar coat it or hide behind the &quot;betterment of your guild&quot; line, that's what you're doing.  You farmed ToV for your Skyshrine/Kael armor and now you farm the North wing.  Don't even make me laugh by saying most of those dragons are so much more difficult to kill than a Kunark dragon.  More hit points does not automatically equate to more difficulty in slaying.  Clearing to them is a bigger pain than anything.  Most of the &quot;true dragons&quot; are perma rooted, so they can be debuffed (if they aren't unslowable) them mem blurred before the main assist engages.  Being perma rooted also equals automatic double damage for any trueshot using ranger.  They don't even fear.  I can tell you right now from firsthand experience, you don't need more than thirty people to kill anything there, except perhaps Vyemm and the Ring of Vulak event.  Armor farming for Skyshrine or Kael can be done with six.  Defensive warriors are not the only melee class that can tank flurry drakes.  <br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
&quot;sorry I find that completely different from taking an AA skill (that doesn't even cost that much to get mind you) and using it to farm now trivialized dragons. Mid teir guilds are at a total disadvantage to compete with this small group of the population that doesnt even NEED these mobs.&quot;<br>
<br>
Need is a highly subjective term in a game.  Technically no warrior NEEDS NToV armor and weapons at this point in the game.  You/your guild WANT those items so different monsters are a little easier (trivial) to kill.  You obviously don't play a wizard as a primary character so you're really not expected to know the intricacies and relative difficulty of leveling one to 60 and accumulation of AA points and without the benefit of having a pre-established alternate character to twink it.  So as far as I'm concerned, your claims that manaburn is an easy to obtain skill for wizards is going to hold as much weight and credibility to me as the incessant  comments I hear of how quickly and easily archery mastery III or endless quiver are to obtain.  And that equals nothing.  People have different priorities and for some, accumulation of AXP points in this game isn't a high one.  For others, they really may not care to obtain an ability that will be of little to no use to them on a day to day basis so some flashy useable only once an hour ability is not going to be a skill they immediately decide to pick up.<br>
<br>
Trivial is also a subjective term.  If &quot;all&quot; a mid tier guild needs to kill a Kunark dragon is a puller then why can't they beat a manaburn team if that guild is there first.  I remember one Gorenaire raid where a ranger kited Gorenaire around while the rest of the raid arrived and buffed then pulled her in for the kill.  I guess mid-tier guilds are too good for that nowadays though and all pullers must be monks or bards.<br>
<br>
All this precious mid-tier content does prepare mid-level guilds for the high end game.  They learn that if they want to get a spawn they better get there first, which means learn to mobilize quicker or prepare in advance.  No high end guild is going to sit by and wait.  I'd like to see a manaburn team drop Wuoshi or the Va'Dyn so easily since they can steal all mid level content with impunity.<br>

<br>
Im not gonna get into endless quoting though but a few words.<br>
<br>
Millkin makes some good points too..<br>
<br>
why do people act like killing dragons for loot is bad? You know you all do it. From farming HoT to Ntov to Arena.. You do it to improve yourselfs or your twinks when no one else needs.<br>
<br>
Who says Wizards don't need money for themselves? we upgrade our loot too.  Caster gear is generally more expensive than other gear especially if its good.  How about Jungle spider fur cap or boots of flowing slime or ring of lightning those all cost 25k+.. No not all manaburn wizards have sunstrike ya know.. Its still one of the rarer spells. And whats wrong with equipping your twinks well? How many people have HoT gear on twinks? How many people have EPICS on their twinks? more than you think.<br>
<br>
Had a little discussion about manaburn in a guild group last night in ntov.. One stated no one class should be able to take out a dragon.. Then someone else said.. What about shamans soloing WW dragons.  AH HA!  Those are mid level content aren't they? I see guilds raiding in WW commonly so why don't people complain when shamans solo WW dragons heck even shadowknights can do it..  someone would come back saying &quot;but the junk they drop isn't worth it&quot; Well i would come back to say that while it isnt a scale the loot they drop can be sold for 1k or a lot more and that adds way up especially since you can do more than 4 a week and you don't have to wait 2 hours for an ability to come back.<br>
<br>
Shamans, Enchanters and warriors are among the richest classes in the game (Montyy will disagree). Wizards are among the poorest pre manaburn.<br>
<br>
Go inspect FK before you call her a farmer Montyy.. A lot of guildmates have more high valued dropable items on them than FK does.<br>
<br>
Farming is generally to improve oneself.. Whats wrong with that? the farming term has been twisted so much that no one knows what it means anymore.<br>

So lets recap.....32k hp dragons double for 400-500...200k hp dragons that quad for 950+....hmm doesnt sound the same to me....<br>

Me killing NToV dragons with 30 or more my guildies and getting getting drops my entire guild needs to progress..... 4 or 5 wizards pressing a button to kill a trivial dragon to get drops they Don't need..... not the same thing either.<br>

Here we go...<br>
<br>
Rangers may not be able to tank Dozer and the high named dragons in NToV for longer than a few seconds, but I've damn sure seen them tank more than a paper bag.<br>
<br>
The only thing I take issue with Millikin's post is her description that anything and everything equates farming. I first heard &quot;XP farming&quot; from her in FG, and I disagree. Back in the day... farmers were called farmers for repeated killings of mobs yielding items they had no need of for the sole purpose of selling. It was a label used to single out greedy players.<br>
<br>
I don't, and never will consider myself a farmer or practice &quot;farming&quot; for wanting to raid NToV to better my armor. Neither will I consider myself an &quot;XP farmer&quot; because I want to level. By that extreme definition, unless all the items you have and all the levels you gained happened by coincidence, you're a farmer... and we don't have ten years to reach our goals on chance occurrences. So don't clump me in with farmers unless you want me to tell you to @#%$ off. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 7/29/02 9:04:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umillikinerreene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Millikin Erreene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Arrowbringer </span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/29/02 10:32:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=167>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> Montyy states:  &quot;And Millikin unless you're an utter moron, you know that kunark dragons arent like NToV dragons....Hell I've only been to NToV 3 times now and I know that.&quot;<br>

I'll presume that since you have no experience in grouping with me for any length of time, much less attended a raid I was present for, (Therefore you are completely ignorant of my capabilities as a &quot;tank&quot;, my hit points, my armor class and other relevant details.) that you are not attacking my play style.  However, the fact that you've stooped to belittling the abilities of a class that you have no working knowledge of, nor is it one that possesses the abilities that are being railed on here (manaburn), is rather indicative that you have no rebuttal to my point that you and your guild's forays are nothing more than farming trips.  Your argument is also rather self-serving and circular.  You aren't fighting mobs that quad for 850 unless you're already in NToV farming, so therefore you don't NEED those armor/weapon upgrades.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm well aware of how much those dragons hit for, which ones are slowable or not, which are perma-rooted, their AEs and effects (and whether or not they're resistable), the strategy for killing them and how to pull them if they're not rooted.  So save your tavern tall tales of how difficult NToV dragon farming is for the ignorant masses, I'm not one of them.<br>

Millikin I'n not sure where the hell you're going on this...you basically say that no one needs armor or weapons, and that since myself and my guild go to NToV to get weapon and armor upgrades, that we are in fact 'farmers' well yes I take offence to that.  Personally I could care less about your ac/hps/play style/knowledge of NToV.... Its you're warped thought process that bothers me.... you seem to know so much about it, then tell me, what raid is going to fair better in NToV? One with a 1100 ac 5kish warrior tanking, or a 1300ac 6500+hp warrior tanking? This aint rocket science <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My arguement on this thread was about MB wizards farming trivial mobs for drops they don't need, and somehow you warp it into some attempt to call me a farmer (not to mention my guild) because we have progressed past the East and West wings of ToV and are now hunting in the North.  What does that have to do with farming? We are bettering ourselves as a guild and a unit. By your logic, VM/LC/Alliance/Wraith/EH/RIP and anyone else who has hunted in NToV are farmers.... just don't get where you're going with this /boggle.  <br>
<br>
I have nothing against manaburn, I think its an effective tool against many high end mobs, wizzies can unload a good chunk of DMG and med/manarobe up to full and be ready to lay more nukes down, my issue is that with this ability, it makes certain mobs completely trivial, and some of these mobs are highly contested (outdoor kunark dragons) and the people who would most benifit from taking down these mobs (be it for epics, haste, etc) now have a snowballs chance in hell of doing so unless its with the either the help or blessing of the servers MB wizzie crews.  The best arguement I've seen on the MBers side is that its all fair under first come first served and that people should plan ahead or mobilize faster, but why should they have to compete with a group of people that don't NEED these mobs??  And yeah wizards give away these epic pieces from time to time, and I think thats great, but I don't see why wizards should dictate which bard gets a White Scale_01 or which Warrior gets Red Scale _02 all the while wondering which Twink is gonna get CoF_03 or RBB_04 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1.  You are stealing midlevel content..<br>
<br>
That is my favorite one.. So many things wrong with that.. Stealing? Ok so we should spoon feed them?  They aren't babies yeesh.. They know how to play the game some of them and the others whine like Quas said cause its out of their control. IF they want it so bad.. camp it.<br>
<br>
2. Why should we ask the wizards permission to kill a dragon.<br>
<br>
You don't. Just announce your intent to take on the dragon. Like you should always do anyway. Say we will have our people here in like 5 minutes.. Most wizards would back down in that situation.<br>
<br>
3. comparing different dragons<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure WW dragons are comparable to Kunark dragons.  Thats where their raid content lies if you are so worried about mid levels.<br>
<br>
I don't feel manaburn should be nerfed cause sometimes its nice to get some extra cash to buy things, its fun and it can help out other people.<br>
<br>
But I also don't think any group raid or burn group should control the dragons..<br>
<br>
Competition is good.. Dominance is bad.<br>

Who says Wizards don't need money for themselves? we upgrade our loot too. Caster gear is generally more expensive than other gear especially if its good. <br>
<br>
?????????<br>
<br>
You obviously haven't made a warrior.  They ARE the most expensive class to have, bar none.  <br>
<br>
Why? Cos they are prolly 80% reliant upon it.  You talk about the slime boots that are 45-55k, in comparison a tank earring drops there.  Any idea how much that is ? 80k.  That's for an earring.  <br>
<br>
If you total up the value of my equipment (which is not great) versus your equipment and take away the no drop status on both, I think you would find that mine would prolly be 3-4X the value of a wizards equipment.  <br>
<br>
But that is of course not the point of the thread.  <br>
<br>
And in addition talking about Raid V Raid, I for one would never compete with another raid out there.  Goes back to the common courtesy thing, if its up and your raid is there - there is no viable excuse for another raid to march over you or lag your raid out in the same breath.  <br>
<br>
I have encountered this before when I was in old Wraith and turned my back on it - I wouldn't expect anyone in any guild to react a let's beat this other raid mentality.  There are a number of other things up out there that also need putting out of their misery.<br>
<br>
I know most leaders/most officers from the big guilds and the majority of them have a similar outlook.  <br>
<br>
Going back to the original point, yes I dont think that the MB wizards should ask everyone whether it is ok to burn dragons.  Just one person would suffice.  If the druid in question was camping Sev, then they should have been at FoB zone.  If the wizards went to FoB zone (the normal pulling spot from my perspective) then the druid in question would have been seen.  <br>
<br>
If he/she wasn't here then fine MB wizards all yours, but if they were they are there for a reason. <br>

Element of Surprise Zeik... If there is a wizard in zone and he sees the dragon up the same time the 1 person from a guild does... Generally the wizards will win.. depending of course of the available of 4-5 wizards (not as easy as you think believe me I'm in the wizard channel all the time) and depending on the buffs they need. I've never been on a burn raid that was under 20min even if there was a raid sitting there... Wizards may make preconceptions about Anti-burners like they are greedy or jealous or something like that which is most likely untrue but the anti burners have preconceptions about wizards. That they are a bunch of greedy rude farmers who can kill a dragon within 5min.. Of course thats not true and it just doesnt happen that fast even though the fight lasts 2 seconds the prep lasts longer.<br>
<br>
2. Good point and we commonly do if there is a raid there... perhaps shouting it would be best... <br>
<br>
3.. Ok I haven't fought one in months but how much different can they be? They are still good practice for mid guilds right?<br>

4. Not according to the women in my sig.. they are there willingly.  Do i sense a new thread coming?<br>

<br>
I played a warrior to lvl 2 once =)<br>
<br>
Warriors I meant are the richest in compared to net worth not extra money... Wizards have few sources of income.. Manaburning dragons is one. Warriors have multiple from raids to exp groups which is the largest sources for them.<br>
<br>
anyway<br>
<br>
Wizards running ahead of a formed raid to burn=BAD.  Raidings running ahead of Wizards to kill=BAD... Raids running ahead of a formed raid=BAD..<br>
<br>
He who was there and ready first is who gets a shot in my eyes.<br>
<br>
I disagree that you said many others share this view.. Many people subscribe to the total FFA way of life.<br>
<br>
Communication between raids whether burn nor regular is important.<br>
<br>
We have argued manaburn to death ressed it and to death again.. If this was a raid people would have stopped long ago but if there has been anything we have learned.. BAD people are BAD and GOOD people are GOOD..<br>
<br>
If manaburn isnt the most controversial ability ever I don't know what is. Giving FD to warriors would be less controversial. <p><center>

<br>
<br>
Quite possibly true at early levels, but at high levels yer going after quest armor anyway... so the point is moot, cause it costs nada (unless yer lazy an buy yer quest gems).  And no, I dont wanna hear ya whine that a CoF is sooo expensive, and you just HAVE to have the 250k SoD, or Willsapper, or whatever.  Give me Montyy in his quest armor, an FBSS, 2 lammies, and a decent group... and I'll do the Warrior job like it's cool.  <br>
<br>
Actually, I take it back... the more i think about it... tanks arent hard at all to equip... or expensive.  Let's look at that.  To get a twinked Warrior to 50, and do it in reasonable comfort... you could EASILY do it with the following (I know this... cause I did it btw):<br>
<br>
* Full set of Crafted<br>
* 2 Lammies<br>
* FBSS<br>
<br>
Total cost?  Maybe 10k if you pay top top top dollar (more like 5-6k if you haggle a bit)<br>
<br>
Sorry folks... but if you honestly think you NEED better than the above to be a great tank... then you seriously outta try a different class... cause if yer relying on gear over talent, you'll never be anything other than ordinary.<br>
<br>
Now that we've dismissed warrior price myth, let's look ahead to higher end gear.  Yes... I'll agree that Warriors (hell, tanks in general) spend way more plat on gear than casters do... they also have a much wider range of droppable loots that drop which they can roll on (assuming NBG grouping) and later sell off to upgrade.  <br>
<br>
Speaking as a caster, the items that I get access to are MUCH rarer that tank gear, and what does drop is usually either No Drop (cant sell it to upgrade later), or doesnt have any kind of market value.<br>
<br>
Soooo Ral, you want that SoD for 250k?  Whatta ya do?  You sell off some hast items, and few geat weapons (cause at yer level, you more than likely have a few stockpiled), etc.  Next thing you know... 250k pp.<br>
<br>
Now let's say a caster wants to spend the 75k or so on the FT3 boots.  What's that caster gona sell?  We have no haste items, and caster weapons dont sell (heck... many casters our level have epics or dont rely on weapons anyway).<br>
<br>
Sooo... wha do we sell?<br>
<br>
Shadel Bandit Ring?<br>
Hiero Cloak?<br>
Ornate Run Shield?<br>
Necklace of Superiority? <br>
Fetid Flesh Belt?<br>
Spider Fur Cap? <br>
<br>
Of the above, only the cap sells for over 10k, and a few of those dont sell for even 5k... yet they are some of the best (and most commonly used) droppable caster items before ToV.<br>
<br>
Soooo... while you may have higher priced goods than casters, you more than make up for it in items available to you to acquire and sell off.<br>
<br>
Sorry bro... might wanna try another argument, cause I'm not buying the &quot;pity-me-cause-warriors-are-soooo-expensive&quot;.<br>

Warriors are the most expensive class to equip and do need to constantly upgrade.  Believe it or not, because we are in groups - I generally cant make the pp you speak of.  I have made 70k now in 4 months.  What have I sold ? Cobalt Helm(10k-bought for 20), Cobalt Bracer(20k-bought for 25k) - because both these were replaced and Silver Chitin Bracer(7k-bought for 10k) oh and in all this time, I have won one item (Silver shiverback belt-looted) - 20k.  The only thing I got left to sell is my cobalt BP when I get my SS BP.  <br>
<br>
So when you look at it, I have actually made 2k.<br>
<br>
And yes, I am looking for 250k to buy myself an SoD and going for Willsapper as well.  But in terms of gaining all of this equipment, as you well know I have worked my ass off for it and got little in return.  <br>
<br>
Being stuck in CT for 2 days over the weekend, I got nada which happens. But we got 4 pairs of FT3 boots which went to the casters because I am only prepared to be in groups who do NBG.  <br>
<br>
Finding caster stuff is just as easy as finding tank stuff, but it is entirely dependent on where you hunt. <br>
<br>
If you want to talk about pp generation, get a few people to go down to SG and farm the hell out of it.  You could easily end up with 20k a piece per night through gems <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/urhesolooshun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhes Olooshun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master of Dice</span><br>  Posts: 89<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/30/02 8:13:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=175>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> Never thought I would see a post where Quas actually makes himself look uninformed, but I have now.<br>
<br>
I can tell you for a fact that it is a helluva lot more expensive to equip a TOP end warrior, than it is to equip a TOP end Wizard.  I can agree that you can easily twink a warrior to 50 for under 10k in items, but after that, any upgrades that are not no drop or questable cost an arm and a leg.  Also, I can submit to you that I can twink a wizard in comparable quality caster armor for easily 1/2 - 2/3 what it costs to twink a warrior.<br>
<br>
The top end warrior, barring quest armor, has several slots he can fill, Earrings/rings/belt/cloak/neck/face/range, for whatever stats he needs, HP/AC being the top two, and for any of the droppable things that are out there that have even decent stats in the HP/AC area, you are gonna pay thru the nose.  Simple economics, there are probably twice the warriors on Quellious in the level 55-60 range that there are Wizards, hence the demand on items is higher, which drives up prices.<br>
<br>
Check out my sig.  The droppable gear on me if I were to try and sell it would fetch 250k without even any effort.  The two earrings are 70-80k each, CoF another 70-80k, the Rubicite Belt is easily 80k, and if I really wanted to be stingy, I could probably get 100k+, and my weapons are the worst part of my armor, Frosty you can get for under 15k now, and the crafted velium is 10k or less as well as a Guard Capt's Mallet. <br>
<br>
Any upgrade that is droppable for me is gonna cast me plenty to buy.  PERIOD.<br>
<br>
Your argument about twinking a warrior to 50 holds no water in this discussion, as we are not talking about twinking, but about making cash to equip your main character.  <br>
<br>
I have a 52 wizzie myself, and he has staff of the wheel, which is the only no drop item on him, his intelligence is over 225, and the total cost value of the items on him if I were to purchase them today would be no more than 12-15k max.  And to top it off, I have met some 60 wizards that have compareable gear.<br>

Of the above, only the cap sells for over 10k, and a few of those dont sell for even 5k... yet they are some of the best (and most commonly used) droppable caster items before ToV.<br>

<br>
Where in the hell do you get off thinking that a heiro cloak or a NoS sell for under 10k????   I certainly haven't seen any that cheap, ever.  And the ORS still sells in the 10k range if I am not mistaken.<br>
<br>
Sorry Quas, but in this case of which costs more to equip, I think you and I can agree to disagree. <p><center><a target="new"href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30880">Rhes Olooshun - 59th Preserver</a></center>

Sorry bro... even with the items you named... they're all sellin for 10-20k.  And you point out one caster item, and one that wont realistically be sold any time soon cause there's nothing much outside of NToV to replace it.<br>
<br>
And sorry you took a loss... but we all know that prices drop on outdated items.  The point is that they're STILL worth a boatload of coin.  <br>
<br>
And as far as 20k per night per person in SG?  Pass the bong hippy, cause I want what yer smoking.  The only gems that sell these days are BDs and chest quest gems... and even then, not for all that much.  You show me a 20k a night SG group, and I'll give you a dedicated nuker/evacer.<br>

<br>
And as far as finding caster stuff, please tell me how you can compare caster drops with tank drops.  CT is the first major zone that I can think of where casters get serious droppable items that you dont have to kill a dragon or a boss mob to get.  As far as Tank droppable item zones go... it's more a case of naming zones that dont have tank droppable items, rather than zones that do. <p><center>

<br>
ROFL... yeah right.  Sure, shamans can solo and farm stuff in some zones but I know few that do.  We are normally cannidancing or switching spells so we don't loot as much as  melee classes in FFA groups.  Some of us roll like paladins and rarely win stuff on raids.  We can't port.  Not many of us charge for buffs.  We rarely make money off of potions we sell since most orders are for guild.  Tribunal forbid if you have to buy higher level spells or if you decide to purchase fungi or JBB.<br>
<br>
Saying that one class is destined to be richer than another is BS.  It really depends on individual player. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ublaloceanos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blal Oceanos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 146<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/30/02 9:10:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=178>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Something I hoped never to see</span><hr size=1> hehe, and i have a warrior twink, oh the irony.<br>

Talk about ignorant.  Take that same warrior you just described and put them in the post 50 game, might work up to mid 50's even like that.  Now, put that same warrior in any high end raid and see how your clerics like it.  Or anyone else for that matter.  Good luck with all that.  Why don't you try to post that nonsense on a warrior board and see how far you get laughed at, heck, why don't you post it on a cleric board and ask them how they would like that warrior tanking for them on a high end raid.  If you want to believe that warrior can do their job now, you are nuts. <p>Talasar Fearghus<BR>
