Again, just playing the Devils advocate card cause well, its going to come up eventually, mine as well be now....<br>
<br>
<br>
If a single person (in this case being you) is in charge of deciding what is and isnt a &quot;flame&quot; and what is and is not a &quot;Disruption&quot; of public discourse...prepare to have either a full inbox of hateful emails on a regular basis, or an empty messageboard.<br>
<br>
While it may be sad to some, realistic to other, the high standards of some are nothing but a joke to others, the &quot;Ravenark Sucks&quot; post may be amusing to many, but a &quot;disruption of public discourse&quot; to one......<br>
<br>
Guess I just find it odd that the &quot;Taste, mood, and direction&quot; of a &quot;community&quot; message board, would be, in essence,  &quot;controlled&quot; by one member of the said community.<br>
<br>
My ideas may seem great to me, my standards may be high, but to someone else, I could be perceived as a fool and a @#%$, or a genius and a king.....<br>
<br>
Im not trying to raise hell here, though it really may seem like that to you, and to anyone else.<br>
<br>
Rather, just as someone that has been around for a while now, and read just about every damn msg board that has had anything to do with this server on an almost daily basis for 2 years...well, I speak from experience.......nothing more.<br>
<br>
So while it may read as criticism, please dont take it as so, its the best way I can make recommendation of what I would choose to &quot;Do&quot; or &quot;What not to do&quot; if I was taking on such a project..<br>

Whenever someone says &quot;you are...&quot; and so on and so forth, instead of &quot;your idea is...&quot;, it becomes an ad hominem issue and not worthy of serious intellectual consideration.<br>
<br>
Of course, this is just my opinion and that of others. As for enforcing rules on any message board, moderators are only effective if they have the confidence and support of the vast majority of participants, so any moderators would probably be selected by the consensus of discussants.<br>
<br>
As Valdayana mentioned, Quellious.com would link to any and all Quellious-related web sites, including an &quot;I hate Kaelon Web Site&quot;, as long as it was remotely related to Quellious. The guidelines and rules that I mentioned would be for Quellious.com's specific forums, should we decide that's the path we want to go. If you don't like our rules, you are free to participate on any of the other sites, or even make your own and we'd link to it. However, because the goal of any rules we establish would be to ensure the environment is the most inclusive and nurturing of its members as possible, fostering respect and community, I'm pretty convinced that an overwhelming majority of players would choose to participate via Quellious.com.<br>
<br>
All of the details of this ambitious project have not been ironed out yet - but we have a large sketch of what we think it should be. For it to be successful, it must be widely inclusive and create an environment in which no one feels intentionally unwelcome. If Valdayana wants her own column, and everyone wants her to have one, then, she shall have one. <br>
<br>
While I have incredible respect for the work that Iuldiin, Ravenark, Raalf and others do on Quellious Collective, the fact is, you can hardly call these forums a real 'community home', because it lacks a visible identity, has no static content, does not have a dynamic interface, and has no organization of information, aside from the forum layout and a small web site attached. I'm not criticizing them -- far from it, it is a phenomenal task to set-up an effective and welcoming web site that is top-notch in design and technology, and with very little notice, QC became an effective temporary home to the Quellious community. However, whereas many knew abotu Quellious Quarters, very few know about QC - and we want to change this by creating a new home for Quellious that has the design and exposure that our server deserves. The Council of Arcana has extensive experience in designing web sites, and we feel we're the natural leader to take the initiative in designing Quellious.com.<br>
<br>
I think most of your concerns are legitimate, but are also moot considering that Quellious.com will be 'moderated' in a fairly democratic fashion, by the players of Quellious themselves. So, I wouldn't be dealing mostly with issues of content - that's up for moderators to enforce - my concern would be issues of web design, graphics, technical support, and ensuring the web site fulfills its function of being the best, most inclusive, welcoming and attractive hang-out for the entire Quellious community.<br>

Here are some preliminary ideas:<br>
<br>
Check out www.CouncilofArcana.com or www.LotusCult.com for examples of two PHPnuke web sites being used for guilds on the Quellious server to give you an idea how powerful and robust the PHPnuke software is. It will enable us to implement virtually anything you can imagine.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Front Page News</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Anyone can submit any news item, and news moderators could publish them to the front page of the site.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Web Links</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We'd have extensive links of Quellious and EverQuest-related web sites, including links to all guilds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Personal Profiles</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We'd implement Desmond of Lotus Cult's immensely popular EQ Profiles add-on (check it out on the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.councilofarcana.com">Council of Arcana web site</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and add your own character to see what an early version of the software enables you to do. We'd work on adding screenshot capability so you can upload screenshots of your characters. I've updated EQ Profiles to be Shadows of Luclin compliant.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Chat and Forums</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We would have and use Java/IRC Chat, and ezBoard forums. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Screenshots</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We'd have an extensive screenshots gallery, where everyone could submit screenshots for publication. On our front page, we'd also have a random screenshot displayed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Mr. and Mrs. Quellious</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
We'd bring back this immensely popular beauty/popularity contest, in which players get to nominate and vote on who they think the best male and female characters on Quellious are, for monthly competitions and then a yearly final.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Advice Columns</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Valdayana and others have already offered their services to provide their own advice columns - and if people support this idea, we'll give them their columns. Valdayana in particular is extremely expressive and carries with her the type of role playing sense of communication that adds flavor and excitement to discussions.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> EQ Database</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I would implement CoA/LC's successful EQ database, which includes maps of every zone, quest walk-throughs, mob/loot listings, and much more.<br>
<br>
The basic focus of Quellious.com would be on enabling everyone to contribute to it. Everyone will be able to submit resources to be published onto the web site - so if you want to announce an event, with a click of a button and the stroke of a few keys, you can publicize what you want on the server calendar and spread the word! Quellious.com will enable all players to make it their home and to use it effectively for whatever purposes they have. If you want to start a discussion about quest strategies, or maybe even form a Quest Strategy Council that meets regularly to publish a weekly journal on quest strategies -- Quellious.com will let you do it, by giving you web space, resources and materials.<br>
<br>
It is an ambitious goal, but I feel that even though CoA may initiate the process, making Quellious.com thrive is something that all of us should take pride in doing. It is, after all, our server's home and will be what we make of it.<br>

You need a decent website for this sort of thing (No offense Iuldin... yea yea I have nfi how to spell it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
However, it sounds to me like you're talking about recreating the same sort of message boards as QQ had. One of the reasons those message boards shut down (among many other issues) was that people wanted to be able to flame. And they wanted to be able to flame in the recognised community environment, without anon posters (In otherwords, not on Everflame).<br>
<br>
I think these boards are well set up, the atmosphere is pretty much like the old QQ boards (a little different), with the flame boards there for those who wish to blow off some steam. Hell, if you look, only about 50% of the flames there are actually about specific people. And 75% of the flames generally get hijacked for humour purposes neways.<br>
<br>
In a nutshell... build the site, it's needed. Just link to these boards as the official ones. Like LC does. Don't use the Nuke boards... they make my eyes hurt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13112">Mordi Tashkarii</a><br>Warlord<BR>

Mordi's right. Attacking the person may not be the &quot;smarter&quot; thing to do, but nullifying the right to attack them doesn't make bad feelings (and in some cases misunderstandings) go away either. Big and small families argue. If they can't they blow a gasket.<br>
<br>
I'd really like people to stick to the facts, but not everyone communicates that way.<br>
<br>
Edit: I wanted to add. There's a Players Assisting Players message board on AOL (sometimes called Players Attacking Players) for RPers to talk about anything freeform RP. Personal attacks are not tolerated. At all. Over the course of four(?) years everything from profiles to writing styles have been debated. In fact, some of the regulars consider PaP a debate forum to work on their skills. Since they're not attacking anyone (which is good), they can post and hash out everything they slightly take issue with (which is sometimes not so good). Sometimes you simply want to lay out your idea and leave it at that for readers to mull. But not so quick! OldTimer_001 wants you to explain why you felt x was important, when in her y experience...blahblahblah. But hey, I didn't intend on replying (does starting a thread endow me with a social obligation to reply in a mental tug-of-war?) You're faced with three choices: make a reply, walk away, or take it to email. If you have the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   nerve</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to mention that you did not like how OldTimer_001 changed what you were really saying, well by God, you have a personal problem with OldTimer_001. It also proves you can't make a point. (But um...I was just helping newbies, not making a point.)<br>
<br>
What's the point (=P) of this rambling? There's no such thing as a perfect posting environment. It's mostly the oldtimers on PaP. Sometimes I think they like to see their screen names up there. People will (un)intentionally find a loophole in the rules, and when it comes to a message board, be the catalyst for an annoyed quiet majority. I'm not saying there shouldn't be any rules, but I'm in favor of the least amount.<br>
