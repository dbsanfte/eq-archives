&quot;I don't engage a mob I can't kill. I know others do, but I personally don't think it's the right thing to do.&quot;<br>
-- Quotes Raehn<br>
<br>
It's a prerogative. You can choose not to kite or can choose to kite. What you feel with regards to kiting <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> has no bearing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> on the rightness of wrongness of it when someone else does it. In other words, your personal approach to kiting doesn't validate a goddamn thing. <br>
<br>
&quot;Here's who was online in Unruled Power and their location when this all happened. It is clear to me that Amaya could not have EVER solo'd Cazel. It is also clear to me that her guildmates were not mobilizing to assist her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smoking mirrors.<br>
<br>
I could reply that there may have been /anon members out, or twinks without tags online. Whatever the circumstances may have been, you, darling, don't get to decide when it's time for someone else to throw the towel in. You stand back and wait for your chance. You're not so much more deserving that you can KS it and walk away without getting called on it here (yes, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> KS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, because there is no &quot;somewhat&quot; KS.)<br>
<br>
&quot;Had the situation been reversed... I wouldn't have engaged what I couldn't kill.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kudos for you. I don't give a flying fuck.<br>
<br>
&quot;Had I engaged the giant that I couldn't kill, would UP have killed it? I sure think so.&quot;<br>
<br>
Back to bad mojo again. I wonder if people like you anticipate and look forward to getting fucked in the rear without lubrication by virtue of the tags over your head.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is my belief she engaged it when she saw me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Psst, it's called taking first aggro on an outdoor mob. I guess all those people KSed on Lodi don't have a reason to gripe since a group can never tell exactly where the turtle will spawn, and regularly has to be kited until the group arrives/is ready. Tsk, tsk. Whiners.<br>

<br>
Erana: Radiant camped Rage twice pre-list. The only issue there was that a cleric who hadn't been online for more than a handful of hours a day (and hadn't been there as long as our clerics) tried to claim the camp. He never had a group of guildies in the zone, except when Rage was due to spawn. Radiant, however, maintained at least a 1-group presence at all times. The cleric has since quit the game, but the guild he was in? ADD. <br>
<br>
Hell, on the first camp, said cleric forced a GM-sponsored roll between the two campers. Our cleric rolled a 36. He rolled a 30. And still hung around until Rage popped, and was upset that he didn't get it.<br>
<br>
That's a stupid and entirely uninformed thing to bring up. There was certainly no issue, save what one person with no legitimate claim on the camp chose to make.<br>
<br>
And as for the incidents in fear... wha? Care to explain?<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And there is probably many more.<br>

Ah. Right. So hearsay + supposition + ignorance (of past situations) = a bad track record? You're the kind of friend I can live without. <br>

<br>
In Hate : Yes we were trained. There is no way you are going to get 15+ mobs back to your camp with a monk pulling unless you want them there. No it wasn't our agro from running the walls, we didn't have any mobs following us they showed up well after we go into camp.<br>
<br>
Cazel : Not sure what I am supposed to feel bad about... Killing a mob that someone else couldn't? I do feel bad that the enchantress doesn't have a guild that will help her like ours. I am sorry she didn't have the people to help her but that is her choice in who she is friends with.<br>
<br>
Arrogance.. Yup or confidence. Didn't know it was arrogant to say you won't engage a mob you can't kill. Sounds like common sense to me. Sure sometimes you push the envelope but I dont go in to ME and pull a mob solo b/c I can't kill it. just like an enchanter with a guild that won't help shouldn't pull Cazel.<br>
<br>
If Radiant has such a bad reputation why do so many people want to join. Strange that... Old School people may not want to join b/c they think they are so high above everone else to join such a &quot;lowibe&quot; guild but where have all those guilds gone? LC is doing VT, who else? Playing EQ a long time doesn't make you smarter.. just makes your characters older.<br>
<br>
Eh... Whiners. Humm... I didn't see Radiant post first about &quot;oooo you trained our hate raid WAAAAHH&quot; No I saw UP post about &quot;WaaaaaH! You KS'd a mob our single ench with her lvl 40 pally friend couldn't kill!&quot; Yup.. Whine on you Crazy Diamond..  <p>Madoc <br>

Radiant is a medium sized guild yet they managed to take down a mob like Vindi (yes I know it is easy for some guilds but was Radiant's first try). <br>

however wasnt it stated earlier that you could not kill him previously so had to get a strat? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=167569">Lormif 58 Beastlord</a><br>

-- Quotes Madoc<br>
<br>
I'm sorry. Where in Verant's rules does it say you need x amount of people with such-and-such a group configuration and you have x amount of time to kill a mob? I find it hilarious that some are trying to prove themselves reasonable when the grudge they hold for UP on a whole has been paraded with admirable flames on this thread from the getgo. But nah, that couldn't possibly impair judgment! Somehow I'm not supposed to link cause and effect. And finally, there are always &quot;special clauses&quot; people reserve for themselves to make allowances for being, in a word, dicks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Didn't know it was arrogant to say you won't engage a mob you can't kill.&quot;<br>
<br>
Arrogance is not setting limits/standards for yourself. Arrogance is deciding your limits/standards are better than someone else's and therefore your standards should be enforced against their will.<br>
<br>
&quot;Eh... Whiners. Humm... I didn't see Radiant post first about &quot;oooo you trained our hate raid WAAAAHH&quot; No I saw UP post about &quot;WaaaaaH! You KS'd a mob our single ench with her lvl 40 pally friend couldn't kill!&quot; Yup.. Whine on you Crazy Diamond..&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know how long you've been with Radiant, but there have been one or two threads here. Long at that, one of them started by Trist.<br>
<br>
It was a sarcastic remark at Raehn's arrogant statements. If one group of people get to decide a chanter/paly is insufficient force to bring down Cazel and their guildmates won't show up before the two die by whatever mystical powers they are endowed with, I can get to decide whenever a group of people will not successfully kill Lodi after an allotted time set by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> me</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, so I shouldn’t have to get scathed here. After all, I’m prescient, right?<br>
