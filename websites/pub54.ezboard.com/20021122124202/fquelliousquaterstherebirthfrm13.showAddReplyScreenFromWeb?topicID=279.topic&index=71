Some of you say you can't beleive Banelion would do such a thing...  well, maybe it wasn't Bane... perhaps it was another ADD member with Bane's account that tried to use Bane's good reputation to get an accomodation that they would not get with thier own sullied one.<br>

Verbo, that's Neomorpheous's monk... sound's like he's learning the ADD way quite well.<br>

And as for Garaddor's promise not to post any more, well, by my calcualtions, we have anout 6 or 7 more posts in this thread before he'll ACTUALLY quit... <br>
<br>
&quot;We're getting stronger every day&quot;  seems to be the mantra of the ADD leadership.  You so desperately need to be &quot;stronger&quot;, want so badly to be &quot;uber&quot; that you're willing to do just about anything to get there.

<br>
&quot;Guild Rules And Conduct<br>
The following rules have been established to make our playing time more enjoyable and not as a means to take away from an individual&amp;#146;s total gaming experience. <br>
<br>
1) Conduct and Character Issues: <br>
<br>
With regard to conduct and attitudes, we encourage people to have fun, laugh and enjoy each other&amp;#146;s company. Do not participate in offensive behavior that may be degrading to other members or even yourself. Please try to police your own actions or they may be reviewed for guild disciplinary actions by our officers. <br>
<br>
Some of the more serious offenses are kill stealing, deliberate deception and any attempt to defraud guild members as well as other players. Our guild members should adhere to the General Guidelines as indicated by Verant. Lying, undermining other members, begging or leaving your wiped out group without offering to help are examples of conduct we wish not have associated with At Deaths Door. When in doubt about a conduct issue, contact a guild officer for advice - &quot;Ignorance&quot; is not a viable excuse. <br>
<br>
Its every guild members duty to act as a guild custodian and police not only your own, but others actions of guild members. Please be discreet when handling these situations and not openly berate members in an open guild chat forum unless no other recourse is available. <br>
<br>
Use common sense when dealing with problems with guildmates and others. Try to solve any problems that you may encounter on your own at first. If you cannot, then please get an officer involved before making snap decisions. Disbanding from the guild &amp;#147;in the heat of the moment&amp;#148; is frowned upon and likely you will not get a re-invite. Disbanding from the guild will result in the loss of all GPK points. <br>
<br>
At Death&amp;#146;s Door does not condone a player having characters in a variety of guilds and require that all characters are associated with this guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
******<br>
<br>
I too feel sorry that this happened, for Maeve and also for my former guildmates who joined ADD and are now caught in the middle. I have had only one issue with one member of ADD personally, and to me, it did not reflect on the guild. To me, the character and reputation of Radiant and those members I value highly, and for them to blast ADD for wrongdoing says something to me...<br>
<br>
it happened...<br>
<br>
I had heard about the Rage thing the other morning, as I logged on just after Rage went down at 5am. I was surprised there wasn't a flame about it, since Rage is a favorite topic of conversation on the boards. But I know there wasn't one... Radiant has class, and respect for others. For there to be an all out explosion towards ADD and Maeve actually flaming (nice one by the way), there is a reason. <br>
<br>
I am unsure why the cleric in ADD has had such trouble with getting Rage. If it's true that he is left to camp there for days on end alone, that is most likely the reason. Camping Ragefire requires support from the whole guild, and if ADD, with their numbers and strength would put even half of their guild to camp with him, he would get it in no time. <br>
<br>
I am sad to see such things going on, and it's too bad with all the zones in Norrath and on the moon, there are still issues with people taking advantage of someone else's hard work, instead of going elsewhere to make their own successes.<br>
<br>

Even my own guild doesnt know the entire story about it they never knew what went on between me and Tristadorn they only know what itold them to do so they have basically no right perspective though i can understand they wish to defend themselves.<br>
<br>
Btw being born in Slovenia english isnt my native language so i dont even understand all the insults that are thrown at me/add so ill not lower myself to responding to them.<br>
<br>
There are people that know me well .. do well in fact that they could have put their hand in the flames for me telling the truth ... though i seriously doubt that they frequent flame boards since theyre nice people ... i would never be aware of this bashing at me had my guild not told me theres a thread here about .. so maybe with everyones allowance i may perhaps give my side of the story which has a bit more to it than Tristadorns 3 point story.<br>
<br>
I was in fact never present there since i was levling my wifes cleric but i do hold ultimate authority over what happened in PoF since add never made a move untill i allowed it or ordered it. I was the most senior officer online at that moment so it fell to me to lead negotiations when it became apparent that there were 2 guilds competing for shissar. <br>
<br>
Let me firstly answer the 3 points made by Tris about it ...<br>
1st point was Radiant was in zone 1st. Actually a druid Neomorpheous was in zone 1st for 3 hours straight before Radiant was even aware of the spawn or so i beleive ... i have no idea when they became aware of the spawn but i knew it was up for all CeT afternoon and Neo was there to keep observing till ppl logged on. If Radiant was first in zone with 1 group yes indeed they were(more explanation of ,why didnt we just stop then as we should have and would if it had happened as Tristadorn describes it, will follow). <br>
<br>
Point 2 and 3 kind of fall into same category ... who aggroed 1st and who pulled 1st .. same thing ... i would never allow pulling some mob that was already pulled except if it was kited around by someone to prevent ADDs sufficient force to engage it till his/her friends could come in (which wasnt the case here so the last part of the sentence is just explaining my way of thinking. I personally dont give a @#%$ about PnP because thats official name for something formal that everyone of us should understand in their hearts and not try to find loop holes in the technicalities of the rule). I asked in /gu and Verbo personally if they have aggroed or have engaged the mob before i gave the order to pull. After the mob was pulled i asked again very specifically if the mob was within its room on the top of temple when verbo aggroed it ... i specifically asked him if the mob was moving when he aggroed it his response was yes it was in the top room and no it was not moving. I had no reason to disbeleive Verbo at that point nor do i now.<br>
<br>
Before i even start more closely explaining my side of the story i would like to say that yes Maeve is one of the nicest people in EQ and im deeply saddened she was hurt. Though in my opinion it was purely Tristadorns fault any of this even occured. Whether he did what he did out of some malicious reason or purely by misunderstanding my orders were in direct response to Tristadorns tells and actions of Radiant that i was reported from my guild.<br>
<br>
Okay to my side of the story now. As i said before we spotted mob well prior to the raid in question but we didnt have the ppl online to do it so we said as soon as some ppl log on we go get it. It was for Qindien that the mob was intended to die.<br>
<br>
As for Tristadorns claim that his guild was in fear well before we even started to contact him is a blatant lie. Tristadorn himself was not even on the continent when have already been sending tells to various Radiant members for at least 15 minutes while they directed me from one of ficer to the other out which i could not get anything but total silence. Only one officer responded to me saying that he will be Raid leader in chief WHEN he gets there (notice that even the raid leader was nowhere near feerott wehn i already had guildies in feerot and was already trying to reason a deal). After i got the confirmation that hes the person to talk to i proceeded to try to work out some agreement. After being ignored totally for another 5 minutes while i was sending tells in the manner /tell &quot;officer i cantremember you name&quot; are you still there  and similar i finally get a response from him telling me that he isnt the person to talk to after all and that i should talk to Tristadorn ... well what else to do (some of my guildies being in feerott joking about contest between a ranger and a monk who would outdamage who on spectres there and ofcourse waiting for my order to move in ... i namely told them to stay put till i talk to Radiant) i send tell to Tristadorn who was still in echo caverns at that time i beleive again all the response i get is &quot;sec&quot; or &quot;im busy&quot; or something in that manner im not sure of exact wording since poor naive me i dont take logs of conversations because i trust ppl wont go back on their words once theyre given. I keep waiting to get a response out of Tristadorn while he goes over to feerott and Radiant goes in (yes they did zone in 1st in force indeed... i am not absolutely certain that tristadorn was with them at 1st breakin so it may be that they ran in a bit sooner but i dont mean this as in so soon that add wasnt there cause there was a person there entire afternoon CET time and im sure i would have known if they did that.) When Radiant is finally in NC or NWC im not entirely sure which (the druid was still there reporting to me whats happening.) i finally get response from Tristadorn &quot;yes lets&quot; in response to my several times repeated suggestion &quot;lets come to some agreement over Shissar&quot;. So i say what do you suggest ... jsut roloff and loser backs off? (i would like to point that Adds force of i think 15-20 ppl was sitting in front of portal in feerott  waiting for me to finally talk to Radiant to see how we could proceed). Again after that tell i got ingnored for some minutes (except telling me that i would get pettitioned and reported for training if we zone in (when again for the Xth time i tell my guild not to go in and mess wiht their cr .. told them to wait that im still talking to them) ... somwhere in that time frame that druid spotter tells me Radiant got wiped again so that might explain why Tristadorn couldnt respond though with the new caching tells im sure he didnt miss any of my tells... i didnt think of that before so i told tristadorn im beginning to feel stalled with promises of agreement. At that point he assures me that im not being stalled and the &quot;agreement talk continues&quot;. I again suggest we roll off and he says he isnt ok with that. So i say &quot;okay man make it a competition then and we say whoever clears to it 1st gets it .. best man wins fair and sqare&quot;. He says hes not okay with that and that they dont want an agreement now since they feel they deserve the mob over us since theyre already up there (all the time leading up to this statement i did not allow my guild who was there in more than sufficient force to zone in because i was talking to Trist about agreement and didnt want ppl to run in and possibly get killed when we could have possibly lost that roll that i was trying to talk about with Trist so unsucsesfully or we didnt wanna ruin their CR (i think we even offered to do their cr for it but it wasnt done by me so i wont put my hand into flame over it)). I said that i cant accept that in no way (would you expect me to have someone ignore me while i try to talk to him ... move past me while i wait for him to respond ... wait for him to get killed rezzed killed again rezzed again while all the time hes letting me beleive that well reach some agreement ... then when he is in superior position to point at PnP rules refuse to reach agreement and basically says i dont want agreement now cause im in place to pull the mob and u suckers are still waiting outside the zone *not his exact wording but thats how i understood it*) to which he responds ill petition and let GM settle it. I agree to that since thats at least SOME sort of agreement and i pettition GMs asking for assistance in a dispute over a mob ... at that time 3 Guides were online so i figure okay should be quick. (all the time my guild is nagging at me why cant they go in and i tell them to stay put till i get GM response). So i wait for that GM to respond and ppl sit around in feerott some more ... my watcher in Fear is reporting to me all the time that Radiant force is clearing way to shissar and not in any matter waiting for GMs so i sent direct tells to the 2 guides twice with 5 or 10 min timeframe between them ... on both occasions i was told to wait that theyll get to it when they have time. I ask the spotter again if he is absolutely sure Radiant is running for the shissar and he says that he honestly beleives they will not wait for GMs but simply pull. At that point i make the decision and order guild to move in clear way and pull and kill the Shissar IF Radiant didnt already engage or would pull/engage while we were runnign in/ clearing. How the pull was done i have explained earlier .. i checked before the pull and after the pull if the mob was aggroed or not. On both counts i received negative response. We killed the mob ... at this point i was still fully willing to roll for it but then my guild reported Tristadorn himself bringing a train to our force at which point i told Qindien to loot it and the hell with the training ... as it happened everyone was wiped out in that train but Qindien was still able to loot the piece. Even though it was 1 am then i kept awake for 2 hours till petition ran out if any GMs respond and when they didnt i finally logged. Today i find this thread of 70+ posts here of what all manner of objects and animals ADD is and me peronsally w/o ever hearing my side of the story. <br>
<br>
To further explain my standpoint here ... i have nothing against Radiant personally i was never present at any of the trouble add and radiant were supposed to have in the past but i can imagine with Tristadorns lack of diplomatic courtesy or tact agreements come very hard. I dont hold any grudges against  Radiant as a guild ... what they beleive happened there is probably because Tristadorn was playing this game of hide and seek and the carrot on a stick wawing in front of my face to delay add and gain himself stronger position from which he could just forget any agreement and fall back on PnP technicalities. Id also like to say that ADD as a guild had nothing to do there ... they only followed my orders and they werent fully informed of the situation as i suspect Radiant wasnt.<br>
<br>
Now to the the essence of the mile long post which i couldnt have just presented w/o ppl that had nothing at all with the matter aside from knowing Maeve or Tristadorn or me for that matter. This is a flame board which is useless for anything other than spreading rumor and dissent so ill make a shock and make a statement here that might actually be constructive in regard to the incident. Ill try to be as objective as i possibly can here. <br>

Let us return to tristadorns 3 points ... <br>
Point one ... the point is true .. Radiant was first in force in fear but only because of the stalling and letting me beleive that we would reach an agreement before any of us went in. That was done not only by Tristadorn but by other members/officers before him (just for the record Maeve was casting c3 in Fungus grove on me and my wife when add was already gathering for Shissar).<br>
<br>
Point 2 and 3 ... i checked and doublechecked we were 1st on the pull and both checks proved positive ... for the sake of argument i will allow a chance that Verbo was mistaken about it or lied to me about it(very doubtfull). I suggest we both petition and let GMs search their logs and i will personally make a formal apology if it turns out that Radiant did in fact aggro first and GM will move item to Maeve. Qindien will not be allowed to use the item to complete epic untill this is resolved.<br>
<br>
My standpoint to Tristadorn ... i thought highly of him even though not knowing him very well as a fellow paladin and a skilled player. Now though i would wish to beleive his deceiving/manipulating me was just a boatload of misunderstandings, LDs in innapropriate moments or zoning to miss tells or plain simple missing some tells in battle spam i am being hard pressed that anything like that would be possible to such an extent.<br>
<br>
Maeve i deeply apologise for any hurt my actions have caused you ... what i did was never intended to hurt you in any way but was solely reacting to Tristadorn. Even though i dont know you well and mostly from hearsay i am to understand that you are one of the nicest people one could possibly meet and i grieve when the biggest @#%$ happens to the nicest people. I understand that you feel angered and cheated but had Tristadorn been more diplomatic you might have had your epic in your hand now. Even sentences such as &quot;This would be our first ench epic in guild and its her last please please let us have the mob.&quot; have been known to sway my resolve in the past but with the lack of respect i was treated by Tristadorn i saw no other way to respond. I wont say anything about what the people in my guild would do or say cause not all are as level headed as me but personally if i can help you in any way i would do so in an instant to make up for the hurt this has caused you. I hold no grudge agaisnt anyone in Radiant for all the cursing and namecalling earlier and i apologise for any uncivil behaviour of co guildies. It was always my beleif that we are all adults and could resolve our differences or deal with conflicting interests withought mindgames and sensless flameboard bashing.<br>

Ps: due to the fact that i wasnt present it is possible that my story of what was happening is slighty aff the mark but not to the point where is could be wrong completely ... i received my information from multiple sources in real time while the thing was happening and they all corresponded so im stating what i was reported here as facts wieved from my guild. (multiple sources meaning something in the manner 2 ppl telling me Radiant wiped when i proceed with /w all Radiant and i see all of them in shadowhaven or bazaar or similar ... this i take for a fact ... same manner was used to verify other statements i wrote here) <br>
<br>
p.p.s.: also i would like to get this matter discussed in tells or email to avoid 30 sensless posts in troll language using obscene language to no obvious purpose other than practice of the words noone ever uses in RL i guess. Im sure we can get this resolved if not to both parties happines at least to a higher extent than at what it is now. <p><center>

If they were in fear to kill the wraith and they had the force and they cleared the way there, they have the rights to the spawn. KS'ing here is not defined as killing something that agros another first. Just like the story with vindi/statue/idol/AoW if you are after something of this magnitude, in a zone that you cant just walk into like Skyfire, the rules are diffrent and very clear. <br>
<br>
Who pulled the wraith first is NOT the topic that needs to be debated. Its what the blue fark was ADD doing when they knew another guild was there, had been there, and had cleared a path to the temple. But here I am assuming you all have a brain larger than a pea <p><BR> Ravenark <BR>

Then they would claim they pulled the mob.

Finally a person from ADD succeeds in making a coherent post.  It's ironic that english is not your first langauge - you still far surpass your english speaking comrades in verbatim.  I believe that you are a good person and try to be honest in your dealings with others.  I honestly did go LD and had a 1018 for over 10 minutes after you first sent me a tell... that was unfortunate (in fact i was pulling my hair out), because I'm sure communication between us could have helped the situation.  When i came back i decided the risk of me LDing again while zoning was pretty high, so i sent you to Trist even though i knew he would be very busy in PoF.  <br>
<br>
I was late logging on (was at work), and in fact by the time i logged in my guild had been clearing for over 2 hours.  i stronly challenge your presumption that we &quot;rushed past you as Tristadorn stalled you with promises of an agreement.&quot;  I don't believe Trist would intentionally do that. I also know for a fact that from the time i zoned in to the time ADD zoned in there were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NO</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ADD in the zone... your druid spotter was lying.. it was just us there.  How many other of your guildies were lying to you, Banelion?  Did they tell you we had already attempted Wraith 4 times and lost?  Some of the believed that, as they said it in /ooc.  I have the feeling that you had the blinders pulled over your eyes because persons present at Fear felt you were holding them back from getting WoS.<br>
<br>
In conclusion - I think we've all vented our frustrations, and let the community know what ADD has been doing and will continue to do to their fellow Quellious players - trample and disrespect them.  The flaming has served its purpose.  I doubt the GM will do more than give ADD a slap on the wrist, but either way we will get Maeve's epic piece. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufeadornlifegiver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feadorn Lifegiver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/12/02 1:55:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=120>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: / all SOB?!? starting to wonder if it is deserved</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Had Radiant not been first in the zone, would that make a difference?  Because it now sounds as if an ADD member was in first scouting and he spotted the mob and waited for forces to log on.  So an ADD member was in the zone first.  This has not been disputed by either side so it must be fact.<br>
<br>
2. Maybe the point is that you have to have a &quot;Raid Force&quot; in the zone first to clear it and such.  Oh ok.  So let's say that is the case.  Then Radiant was in the zone first.  Oops, wait a second.  Were they first in the zone because they rushed in (hence the multiple wipe outs they incurred) because Trist knew ADD was gathering forces just outside of Fear?  Did they rush in because Trist didn't want to have to come to an agreement of some sorts?  Did they rush in because Trist didn't want to have to roll were it to be petitioned?  (And yes, you CAN petition on issues in other zones.  I've done it myself and a GM will respond to the petition.)<br>
<br>
3.  So, because Radiant zoned in first, in a hurry, while an ADD officer was trying to work out a compromise with the Radiant leader, is this suifficient reason to say they owned the spawn?  Because if it is, then you are saying ADD had no right to it, because ADD chose to NOT rush in, but to rather attempt a negotiation BEFORE zoning in.   And if you are saying this, then you are saying that ADD should be punished because they tried to do the right thing before it became a competition and a fight between guilds.  You are also saying Radiant was first in the zone.  Which they weren't because it's been established that ADD had a scout in the zone l before anyone else.  (see #1 above)<br>
<br>
4.  Now that we have heard both sides of the story the picture becomes a little clearer.  First, what Trist posted originally is clearly one sided and only a small portion of the story.  He never mentions why he ordered Radiant to make a rush upon zoning in.  He never mentions that an ADD officer attempted negotiations other than to say Banelion told him ADD was going to engage.  Bane said this AFTER he attempted negotiations, was ignored and Radiant zoned in.<br>
<br>
5.  Trist said, &quot;Seeing that things were heating up, we kicked the raid into overdrive, pulling out the entire temple so that we could pull the Wraith. &quot;  Note these important words &quot;pulling out the ENTIRE&quot; temple&quot;.  This indicates that they rushed in and aggro'd the whole temple.  It also supports later testimony by Radiant members, stating that Trist and another Radiant member kited the whole temple so Bip would pull the Wraith.  <br>
<br>
Now, later in Trist's post he says &quot;Then they have the audicity to blame me for the train their puller brings into their camp.&quot;  <br>
<br>
So my question is this...How did Verbo get a train, when Trist and friend had already trained everything out of the temple and were kiting them?  Also, how does Trist know that ADD's &quot;puller brings a train into their camp&quot;?  I can only see one conclusion based on what's been presented...Trist knew there was a train in the ADD camp because he brought it.  What other conclusion can there be, based upon Trist's own statements and those of his guildmates?<br>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion if we are to believe 99% of what BOTH parties are saying then we can conclude the following:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Both guilds had one or more members in the zone spotting.<br>
<br>
2.  Both guilds gathered to take down Wraith at approximately the same time.<br>
<br>
3.  A negotiation was attempted.<br>
<br>
4. One guild rushed in, in an attempt to claim ownership and got wiped out not once, but twice.<br>
<br>
5. Both guilds eventually wound up in the zone competing for a mob that had not yet been engaged by EITHER party. (This is prior to either puller aggroing it.)<br>
<br>
6.  One guild attempted a very fast clearing of the mobs in order to get to the main target faster than the other guild that was still attempting to negotiate before, during and after they zoned in.<br>
<br>
7. One guild attempted to do this clearing extra quick by training and kiting numerous mobs out of harms way so their puller could pull the target mob.<br>
<br>
8. While this kiting was going on, both pullers for both guilds attempted to aggro the mob.  Not at the same time, and it is still unclear if each puller knew what the other was doing and who engaged first.<br>
<br>
9. When one puller got enough aggro to actually make the pull to their group, the other group's kiter chose to bring his train to the group that made the pull.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this case I clearly think there were &quot;wrongs&quot; by both parties.  Both parties went to extremes to ensure they got the mob.  One by rushing and kiting mobs away, and one by force of their occupation.  Neither party was entirely right and neither was entirely wrong.  Other than the train brought by the kiter, no official rules were broken, although rules of courtesy and sportsmanship were ignored.  However, one guild clearly offered a courtesy and sportsmanship resolution.  The same resolution they were forced to swallow several days earlier in another disputed spawn.<br>
<br>
Finally, since no one is going to flip-flop positions and concede to the other party, why not do like they used to do in the olden days?  Why not let the &quot;Kings&quot; (Leaders) of each guild chose 6 of their best &quot;Knights&quot;.  These 12 knights would then proceed to meet on the battlefield Arena and the last team with a live member wins the rights to the disputed item that was looted.<br>
<br>
NO RULES will exists for this fight, with one small exception. The one exception?  Once the fight commences no one can interfere in ANY WAY.  No heals, no buffs, no advice, no nothing.  Do all the buffing, strategizing, and preparing you want, before the fight.  Then leave em alone to fight for the honor of their guild.  Let the guild leaders choose those races and classes they think will survive the best.  All chosen &quot;knights&quot; must have been a guild member at the time of the disputed spawn.<br>
<br>
To ensure fairness and to resolve any disputes with the fight, each leader may chose ONE member of the OTHER guild, to act as a referee if a dispute should occur.  The two referee's will make a binding decision.  Or better yet, invite a GM to attend and resolve any disputes with the fight.<br>

I bet no one agrees to this, because it's easier to cry and whine than it is to work out a solution.  What better solution is there, than to have a guild war of sorts?  In fact, this is how Verant should settle all spawn disputes.  Turn on guild war for the disputing parties and let em go at it until it's decided. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

lol   not sure what else to add to that. salta and master of the flame boards or whatever. i guess school got out early today and mom let you on the comp. <br>
<br>
everytime something happens  with anyone, us or otherwise  here comes master salta and the other dimwits preaching thier words of wisdom  and how their view of the world on eq is the right one.  give it a rest and grow up a little.<br>
  i wasnt there for this one and dont have all the facts here so im not chiming in on the incident, but im sure all you angels that posted  on the 6 previous pages always do things in the best interest of others and always play by pnp and with honor etc. <br>
 i haven't read through the 6 pages of trash here and not sure i have the time or patience other then for amusement, but if anyone has any trash talking to do about banelion  please take it up with me, im sure he wont trash talk or have alot to say on your level but i surely will on his behalf. <br>
hes a better player then most out there and plays with more honor then anyone i know almost to the point of being too nice or simply in character for his class though hes like that full time. <br>
dont bother on the boards i doubt ill be back i only came cause somone added link to a post about this, feel free to take it up in game in tells.<br>

<br>
The language and mentality of the people posting here as 'officers' of ADD proves Radiant's point far better than any log I could read.  With people like these 'officers' leading ADD, I have no hesitation in believing every story I hear about them.<br>
<br>
Banelion, you seem to be the only ADD officer here with intelligence and maturity. I suggest you examine your guild leadership a bit more closely.  I'm certainly not impressed with it. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=147233"_blank>Aillron Lifereaver</a>
