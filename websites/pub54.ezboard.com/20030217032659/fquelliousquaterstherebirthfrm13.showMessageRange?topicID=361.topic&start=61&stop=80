<br>
Nice way to start a rebuttal, especially considering you later accuse me, falsely for the most of, of ad hominem attacks. For the record:<br>
<br>
1) Bulvai is an historical name from northern Europe. I chose to spell it phonetically for simplicity's sake. It was at the end of a long list of historical names attempted in sequence. Were it an attempt at plagiarism or homage paid to the book, the toon named such would've been a warrior, not a shaman as it is. <br>
<br>
2) Were I strictly plagiarizing, I would've used the proper spelling (Bulwyf, from what I recall, and there was a half-elf warrior on Quell for quite sometime with that name).&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Actually strictly speaking it you want to be clever it would have to use a nordic font to be correct but it doesnt change the fact that you ripped it straight out of the movie (first and last name) and at least you dont deny it though you try to cloud the issue admirably - nice try.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;3) Where does someone using a name like &quot;Fkin666&quot; have anywhere to stand in criticizing anyone else's name?&gt;<br>
<br>
This is actually amusing - I was given the name fkin when a gm shortened it from my originally chosen name so I didnt pick it (the 666 part is just because other people someplace are using many other Fkin872364 combinations). In any case feel free to critisize Agathorn the original GM of Quellious. Pointing out that you plagerized the name is hardly a personnal attack though - its a statement of facts as I see them.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;You missed the plot again but I will respond to all your 'points,' most of which are dressed up as valid argument but none of which contain much in the way of a rebuttal to what I said.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are slightly correct. Your original post contained such little substance that I had little worthwhile to directly rebut.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was not talking about the word all on its own - this misses the point entirely.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, this does not miss the point in the slightest. You were assaulting that phrase because you do not personally see liberty and justice being applied to everyone. Or are you so crass as to state that you think it is applied to no one at all and you are positing that no one enjoys either liberty or justice and thus the phrase should be wiped utterly.&gt;<br>
<br>
Interesting first you say I said nothing of substance and then you make several statements about issues that you feel I addrtessed that are clearly at least somewhat important to you... Please make up your mind. As I said above you took one word out of what I said and tried to say I said soemthing in particular that I DID NOT say. I then repeated and clarified what I said and then gave examples. Of course herein you neither address the original point I made, the expanded rebuttel or the examples I cited. This clearly shows that not only do you feel unable to address the actual issues in a reasoned manner but you simply dont actually understand what the issues actually are.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was talking about liberty and justice for all (the implication being that it is equally applied) - CLEARLY this is not the case.&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;And? Why should justice be equally applied? We have Judges for a reason. Each case must decided on its' own merit. Should an offense deserve more punishment of one person than another, so be it, the Judge will weigh otpions and decide. To do else is to reduce our judicial system to a simple mechanical process, a Kangaroo Court.&gt;<br>
<br>
Ok this is classic - you clearly dont understand what equal protection under the law actually means (as enshrined by the constitution and our laws. What this means is not 'Each case must decided on its' own merit. (and the rest of the paragraph of the above section)'. Equal protection under the law means that people have the right to expect to be equally protected by the law and 'from' the law. This means that if you commit murder - you will be arrested and charged in a timely fasion, and given resonably similair cases, you should expect a reasonably similar result. This does not happen. If you commit a serious crime in the US and you are wealthy and connected you are somewhat less likely to be charged than a poor person, and typically you have a much much higher chance of being convicted if you are poor. This is FACT.<br>
<br>
&lt;We have examples here in the States of justice being &quot;equally&quot; applied. It's such lovely things as mandatory sentencing for drug offenses and the Three Strikes program. I am not a Liberal guy, but even I can see that a first time offender with a pocket full of LSD does not merit 20 years in jail. The state of California does, though.&gt;<br>
<br>
This statement has almost nothing to do with what I said but I will say this - if you are a famous movie actor and you are repeatedly busted for drug abuse and are even caught with large amounts of drugs and your name is oh say Robert Downey Jr, you can cop a plea deal quite easily and avoid jail most of the time. If your a poor black guy and you get caught with large amounts of drugs - guess whats going to happen to you. If anything you are argueing FOR my point here - the equal protection clause is supposed to prevent things like this. It is quite easy to duck the three strikes law and other such laws if you plea bargin and cop to a lesser plea. Thanks try again.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;I am sorry you don't see this but its a fact. Poor people are convicted almost every day, usually because they have little in the way of decent representation, while the number of rich criminals in jail is few indeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
While I am broadly disgusted by the actions of a certain high profile few in avoiding their just fate, I am not cynical enough to decry the whole concept. It is also conceivable, if one uses a shred of logic, that there are far more poor people in the world, thus it would follow that there would be more people incarcerated. &gt;<br>
<br>
I am not sure where you get off saying this - you appear to be avoiding the point again. I NEVER decried the whole concept. YOU said I did - what I said and I quote &quot;do you folks really believe the 'liberty and justice for all' bit? While we do enjoy a large measure of liberty and to some extent justice, more so than many in the world, its pretty easy to argue that equal justice for all in this country is little more than a fairly cruel joke in reality to be honest.&quot; - there is a big differance between decrying the CONCEPT and saying that we dont live up to our claims. You will also not that I CLEARLY said &quot;..While we do enjoy a large measure of liberty and to some extent justice..&quot; so I did say we do have a measure of each. Sorry but you are totally off base here - AGAIN.<br>
<br>
&lt;While your implication that a high-dollar attorney is a way to avoid justice, I counter with the idea that justice is applied to those who use such a path in the less forgiving court of public opinion. This does, however, wander off topic.&gt;<br>
<br>
Let me get this straight - you seriously believe being ostricised by some people like OJ Simpson is by some - is in any way seriously comparable to doing hard time? Pardon me but this displays a stunning lack of comprehension of how utterly unpleasant and dangerous prison is to say the least.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Actually no I didn't say that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, you did. The structure of the line I was referring did not mate it to your overall argument. Your denigration of the &quot;justice for all&quot; line was quite seperate from the reference to &quot;mouthing the words.&gt;<br>
<br>
No actually I did not say that - and I note that you didnt quote me because you cant - see my rebuttel two points above. Shouting I said something at the top of your metaphorical lungs doesnt change the actual fact that I said no such thing - and have now clarified the point no less than three times.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;I did say that mouthing these words hasn't helped us achieve them though.<br>
<br>
Really, and what logical proof do you have of this? Can you honestly state that a particular portion of the socialization of our youth does not add to the overall effect? You've done or read studies wherein schoolchildren were kept from stating the Pledge and turned out to be model citizens? I'm not saying that the words have some magical effect or that they do generate positive feelings for the country, but I somehow do not see how you are making this statement. There simply is no basis for it.&gt;<br>
<br>
Since basically everyone is forced to say it, and we have the highest crime rate in the first world, and even more than many third world countries I think this speaks for itself. I would also point out that I discussed the japanese example but apparently you cant counter that, and cite nothing yourself so again you are simply trying to shout me down rather than present anything new - nice try but no I have addressed the point.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Case in point - America has a huge problem with many types of crime and violent crime in particular. Though the average Japanese citizen may or may not have (this is arguable of course since we are not talking absolutes) the same degree of absolute liberty most Americans enjoy - they have an extremely effective justice system - there are lots of numbers out there feel free to check them out - but their percentage of unsolved crimes in a fraction of what ours is. Their incidence of crime in all categories and particularly in violent crime is MUCH lower.&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;Apples and Oranges. Japan is a fraction of the size of the USA, with a fraction of the populcae. It is also far more homogenous racially, liguistically, and culturally. There are very few analogues the the USA in this world, one of the few being the Russian Federation, and even it is different enough as to not warrant close and accurate comparison.&gt;<br>
<br>
This avoids the entire issue I suppose I should expect this at this point - I will run through this again though. One - I was talking about crime rates and rates of solved crimes - the japanese may only have a fraction of our population (but its a good sized fraction) but since parrallel studies (and there have been a lot of them on various counties) look at percentages that simply is not relavent. I can understand you not knowing anything about Japan - you admit your ignorance and thats ok I have been there and my first Bachelors was in political science and far east studies, so after actually having been there (and korea) and studied there and with japanese people I may have an insight into a few things about japan.<br>
<br>
&lt;As far as the relative liberty of the Japanese citizenry, I've no basis to dispute or believe that statement. I'm not Japanese. I do not live in Japan. I do however remember many times when my Japanese grandmother used to comment about how many choices she had here in America, and about how big everything was, wide open, people could do anything they wanted, be anything they wanted, etc. My grandmother was from the island of Hokkaido and moved in the 40's after marrying my grandfather, so perhaps she wasn't aware of the Japan to which you are referring.&gt;<br>
<br>
ok this is an interesting paragraph first you say you have no basis to dispute what I said then you do so anyway. To top it off you agree with my original point and I quote &quot;Though the average Japanese citizen may or may not have (this is arguable of course since we are not talking absolutes) the same degree of absolute liberty&quot; - Its amusing that I clearly say that the japanese may have less choices and less absolute liberty (for example all japanese must register with the local police if they move) - thanks for agreeing with my point - are you trying to actually dispute me here?<br>
<br>
&quot;I wont address the second half of that paragraph because it is simply a weak ad hominum attack and really has nothing to do with the matter at hand.<br>
<br>
&lt;Nice. First, it is &quot;ad hominem&quot;. Second, an &quot;ad hominem&quot; attack is when I choose to assault the arguer instead of the argument. For example, this would be like saying that your argument is invalid because you have a 666 after your name and are thus inbred. If you go back and reread what I said, you will realize that I was not assaulting the arguer, I was still assaulting the arguement. Calling your argument unfocused was not, in any way shape or form, an ad hominem assault. It was simply calling it as I see it. If you go back and reread your post critically and objectively, it was rather unfocused.&gt;<br>
<br>
Actually you made a number of personnal attacks there - and your not exactly a prize as far as spelling and strictly perfect grammer goes so I wouldn't personnally get over excited because I misspelled one letter in a latin term. Where exactly is the word &quot;stringentest&quot; in the dictionary? (let alone 'most stringentest&quot; which is right up there with most bestest as least worstest). Labelling someone with obviously derogetory terms such as &quot;deep cynicism&quot; that you tried to label me with is clearly a personnal attack. I actually believe in the fundemental good intent of man, perhaps you do not.<br>
<br>
&lt;The latter half of the posted quote did actually have something to do with the entire argument. Is segued into the next paragraph and set up the idea of high aspirations.&gt;<br>
<br>
Not particularly no it basically was just a personnal attack that then made the sweeping statement that I dont understand &quot;human psychology on a mass scale&quot;, while your next arguement goes into matters of interpretation - two very different points (sure you bridged it with some sarcasm but that was the point).<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;This is basically another personal attack and doesn't say anything about the matter at hand - I think should go without saying that mouthing the pledge does nothing at all towards achieving the aspirations it asserts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Again, you confuse what is not an attack for a personal attack. Your post was incredibly cynical in tone. I suggest again a critical and objective revisiting of your own material.&gt;<br>
<br>
I read your sarcasm alongside your previous personnal attack as a continuation of the same - to bad you still cant address the original point of the paragraph.<br>
<br>
&lt;I suggest again that you've nothing to support your statemet that the Pledge has, or does not have, an effect on our National aspirations. In point of fact, your very argument assaulting the inclusion of the phrase &quot;and justice for all&quot; leads me to believe that you feel cheated without these things and perhaps strive harder to bring such into your own, if only by arguing the point on flame boards. I would say that the Pledge has had an effect on you.&gt;<br>
<br>
Ok, now you are repeating yourself - you said almost the same thing a few paragraphs above, then you go into some rather sweeping statements about what you think I really think. Sorry but I said exactly what I think and I was quite clear about it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok this is an interesting paragraph. It starts off with another personal attack&quot; <br>
<br>
&lt;My, you are touchy. How is pointing out the tone of a portion of your post a personal attack. Did my verbage escape you? You were lightly feigning surprise and amusement that this topic was even being discussed. I would called this feigned incredulity simply because I would not be so crass as to assume that you really would be surprised about any minutiae we might discuss. &gt;<br>
<br>
Repeating yourself again you talked about my reply to your &quot;feigned incredulity&quot; a couple paragraphs up but now you adress it again - I can only assume you lost track of what you wanted to say and threw this in to pad your post.<br>
<br>
&lt;Far from being an attack, this was paying you a shred of respect. Obviously no good deed goes unpunished. <br>
<br>
&quot;then proceeds to assert a deeper understanding of the motivations of the framers of the constitution that the supreme court.&quot;&gt;<br>
<br>
I am sorry but the entire point of this discussion is that people shouldnt be forced to utter religious plattitudes if they dont agree with them.<br>
<br>
&lt;Again, you assume much. I presented an alternative viewpoint and proferred the idea that the Supreme Court is not infallible. Were the Supreme Court so infallible, the addition of the &quot;under God&quot; line would not have made it in the first place, nor would a profusion of other outright bad decisions have been made throughout their history.&gt;<br>
<br>
Whether you like it or not the Supreme Court is the institution that is THE authority on these matters and I would suggest that at least to this point thus far they do not agree with your particular perspective, perhaps you should examine your own falibility here. In addition after readin the federal papers and assorted other documents I came away with the impression that while the Framers had a great deal of devotion to god - they also realized that narrow minded people would always try to push their views on other people - and that this was one of the most destructive forces at large in the world today. More wars have have religious causes and overtones that any other single cause by far. (hopfully this point doesnt need clarification as well.)<br>
<br>
&lt;As an aside, please do not confuse this as an assault on the Court. Humans are fallible.&gt;<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with the original point sure humans are fallible but they are the ones (they being the court) that ultimately decide and interpret the constitution, and I would argue that their vast experience in the field perhaps gives them a much more broad perspective than you or I. Remember that YOU brought this point up. <br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;It then finishes with an attack on the faceless media and atheists, and a general restatement of what I did not say about the word 'all'.&quot; <br>
<br>
Again tih the assaults thing. Trust me, were I assaulting someone, I'd say it. All I was saying was that the Establishment Clause, like everything else in the Constitution, has been held up for interpretation. &gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Still, it has been decided, occassionally by the Supreme Court but more freqeuntly by the Media and Atheists everywhere, that this is not the case.&quot; Its quite obvious that you are using the 'media' and 'atheists' as derogetory terms here and you clearly do not agree with 'them' I think that qualifies as a general attack since you dont actually point out who the &quot;Atheists everywhere&quot; are - is this some sort of conspiracy you are proposing exists?<br>
<br>
&lt;As an aside, again, this is more of an ad hominem attack than anything I wrote. I, at the least, had the decency to refute your statement instead of simply quoting them and then deriding them.&gt;<br>
<br>
No you quoted them and attacked them and I returned the exact same tone and general manner if you cant take it dont dish it out.<br>
<br>
&lt;&quot;Bravo it may be a luke warm flame but its worth no 'points' in an argument and has nothing to do with the topic per se.&quot;<br>
<br>
LOL, this was not even a luke warm flame. If you think it was a flame at all, might I direct you to read some of Salta or Ravenark's less family friendly ones as a better idea of what a flame should be.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you are trying to convince people that your point of view is valid and that you really are ok with other people's belief systems - labeling all athiests and others who don'g agree with you wont win you many converts.&quot;<br>
<br>
Your assumptions have become impressive. <br>
<br>
1) I am not trying to convince anyone of anything in this thread. I am arguing a point or three. There is a difference. <br>
<br>
2) I am not trying to gain converts. See point #1<br>
<br>
3) I am generally okay with other's belief systems and have never said otherwise. I challeneg anyone to show me where I have denigrated a belief system. I may denigrate a believer, an establishment dedicated to a blief system, or the trappings thereof, but I rarely deride a belief system in itself. Again, there is a difference.&gt;<br>
<br>
From the way you use the word Athiests and the colorful quotes that follow its QUITE clear you are denigrating them - I quote -<br>
&quot;<br>
Joe Atheist: I don't believe in God<br>
Jane American: How nice for you.<br>
Joe Athiest: You shouldn't believe in God, he doesn't exist.<br>
Jane American: Thanks for shoving your non-beliefs down my throat. Someday you'll learn.<br>
Joe Atheist: Your Pledge has been shoving your beliefs down my throat for years! I'm the victim!<br>
Jane American: How nice for you. I'll pray for you.<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
This is so sarcastic and derogetory it makes me wonder how you would feel if I reversed the roles and reverse your sarcastic names - would you be offended? I submit this for your perusal:<br>
&quot;<br>
Joe PushyChristian: I  believe in God<br>
Jane Niceperson: How nice for you.<br>
Joe PushyChristian: You should believe in God, he does exist.<br>
Jane Niceperson: Thanks for shoving your beliefs down my throat. Someday you'll learn.<br>

&lt;4) What precisely did I label the atheists?&gt;<br>
Pretty clearly this is a naughty word for you or you wouldnt be so fixated on them. Your own words as quoted and contrast above are fairly damning I dont really need to add much to them.<br>
<br>
&lt;5) What bearing does the above quote have on anything. I'd say &quot;unfocused&quot; again, but I believe I've used it enough.&gt;<br>
<br>
Yes you seem to think you mean something by it - first you claim that you dont like to have a exhaustive examination point by point of an arguement and them you proceed to do it here - so - are you therefore unfocused as well? Again, I would say to you - make up your mind please.<br>
<br>
&quot;While I myself am a christian and believe in god - I don't believe forcing other people to say the words 'under god', have prayers in school or the rest of the pledge and trying to brainwash little kids is a good choice - I suppose that is where we are different.&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;Good for you. I'm not Christian, and don't profess any sort of faith or belief in anything, much to my disappointment. I have also stated early on in this argument that the 9th Circuit Court made the right call. Did you read some part of my post that I didn't? I never said a single thing about the &quot;under God&quot; line in reference to your post.&gt;<br>
<br>
No but you made other statements that to my mind make your intent fairly clear scroll up and read them again if you need to do so.<br>
<br>
&lt;Reciting a Pledge and brainwashing are a bit different. If you cannot see this statement as true, try researching MK-ULTRA, the USSR under Stalin, Chairman Mao, Orwell's 1984, or Psycholinguistics practiced by Revivalist ministers. Reciting a Pledge once a day is socialization and might just help in building good citizens.&gt;<br>
<br>
Actually I am fairly familiar with most of these issues - its amusing that YOU bring up Orwell here because mass chanting and memorization of selected text fits in well with 1984. I am sorry but socialization is interaction not rote recital of text.<br>
<br>
The best part about this is the last line. I gave a better argument as to why the 9th Circuit was correct far earlier in the discussion, and I am somehow on the side of the &quot;under God&quot; crowd.<br>
<br>
Again read your own posts - I quoted them pretty extensively and its pretty clear how you really feel.<br>

<br>
&amp;#61656; Actually strictly speaking it you want to be clever it would have to use a nordic font to be correct but it doesnt change the fact that you ripped it straight out of the movie (first and last name) and at least you dont deny it though you try to cloud the issue admirably - nice try.<br>
<br>
The last name was Hammersson? I’ll have to go back and watch the movie again, but I doubt it. I chose Hammersson because the toon was a shaman of the Tribunal, and to call  himself  Son of the Hammers was appropriate. I chose my main’s name as my ezBoard name for simplicity sake. <br>
<br>
Now, please explain to me how I would use a Nordic font in EQ or ezBoard? <br>
<br>
&gt;This is actually amusing - I was given the name fkin when a gm shortened it from my originally chosen name so I didnt pick it (the 666 part is just because other people someplace are using many other Fkin872364 combinations). In any case feel free to critisize Agathorn the original GM of Quellious. Pointing out that you plagerized the name is hardly a personnal attack though - its a statement of facts as I see them.<br>
<br>
Right, accusing me of plagiarizing, regardless of circumstance, is very much a personal attack, especially when the original name is an RL name. I won’t give you grief about using your main’s name as your board handle as I did the same, but, damn, couldn’t you have had the GM change you name to something better, or at least more original? Hell, if there are enough “Fkin” types out there that you need a “6666” after it, sounds like you plagiarized a bit too.<br>
<br>
&gt;Interesting first you say I said nothing of substance and then you make several statements about issues that you feel I addrtessed that are clearly at least somewhat important to you... Please make up your mind. As I said above you took one word out of what I said and tried to say I said soemthing in particular that I DID NOT say. I then repeated and clarified what I said and then gave examples. Of course herein you neither address the original point I made, the expanded rebuttel or the examples I cited. This clearly shows that not only do you feel unable to address the actual issues in a reasoned manner but you simply dont actually understand what the issues actually are.<br>
<br>
Actually, I said that you’d said little of substance. There is a difference. The core issue, whether or not the phrase “with Liberty and Justice for all” was very much addressed. Again, reread the post.<br>
<br>
&gt;Ok this is classic - you clearly dont understand what equal protection under the law actually means (as enshrined by the constitution and our laws. What this means is not 'Each case must decided on its' own merit. (and the rest of the paragraph of the above section)'. Equal protection under the law means that people have the right to expect to be equally protected by the law and 'from' the law. This means that if you commit murder - you will be arrested and charged in a timely fasion, and given resonably similair cases, you should expect a reasonably similar result. This does not happen. If you commit a serious crime in the US and you are wealthy and connected you are somewhat less likely to be charged than a poor person, and typically you have a much much higher chance of being convicted if you are poor. This is FACT.<br>
<br>
Right, I don’t understand what Equal Protection means? Equal Protection statutes allow for the same basic protection under the law for each person regardless of standing. These protections are, for example, from unreasonable search and seizure, double jeopardy, cruel and unusual punishment, et al. A wealthy man is read his Miranda Rights same as a poor man. A wealthy man enjoys the benefits of the 5th Amendment much as a poor man. All have the same basic protection under the law. How do you not see this?<br>
<br>
You seem to have a problem with the outcome of the trial. And? The outcome of the trial is not part of the package. Equal Protection works to keep you safe from, multiple trials, unfair evidence practices, etc. Regardless of the outcome of a trial, each person enjoys those basic protections.  Those protections don’t guarantee an outcome though. If you have a problem with what these high power types do in courtrooms, remember that a jury of our peers handed down the final decision in most of these cases. Thus it is our fault.<br>
<br>
&gt;This statement has almost nothing to do with what I said but I will say this - if you are a famous movie actor and you are repeatedly busted for drug abuse and are even caught with large amounts of drugs and your name is oh say Robert Downey Jr, you can cop a plea deal quite easily and avoid jail most of the time. If your a poor black guy and you get caught with large amounts of drugs - guess whats going to happen to you. If anything you are argueing FOR my point here - the equal protection clause is supposed to prevent things like this. It is quite easy to duck the three strikes law and other such laws if you plea bargin and cop to a lesser plea. Thanks try again.<br>
<br>
Actually, for every instance of a famous person getting off on a charge, I can name you an equally famous person that got hammered for one. If you examine the stats, that “poor black guy” that you mention cops pleas quite a bit too. You just don’t see it showing up on your TV set. It happens all the time.<br>
<br>
&gt;”While I am broadly disgusted by the actions of a certain high profile few in avoiding their just fate, I am not cynical enough to decry the whole concept. It is also conceivable, if one uses a shred of logic, that there are far more poor people in the world, thus it would follow that there would be more people incarcerated.” &gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;I am not sure where you get off saying this - you appear to be avoiding the point again. I NEVER decried the whole concept. YOU said I did - what I said and I quote &quot;do you folks really believe the 'liberty and justice for all' bit? While we do enjoy a large measure of liberty and to some extent justice, more so than many in the world, its pretty easy to argue that equal justice for all in this country is little more than a fairly cruel joke in reality to be honest.&quot; - there is a big differance between decrying the CONCEPT and saying that we dont live up to our claims. You will also not that I CLEARLY said &quot;..While we do enjoy a large measure of liberty and to some extent justice..&quot; so I did say we do have a measure of each. Sorry but you are totally off base here - AGAIN.<br>
<br>
Uh, Slick, you called “liberty and justice for all” a “cruel joke”. That’s pretty much decrying the whole concept. You might be more credible if you were more consistent.<br>
<br>
&gt;Let me get this straight - you seriously believe being ostricised by some people like OJ Simpson is by some - is in any way seriously comparable to doing hard time? Pardon me but this displays a stunning lack of comprehension of how utterly unpleasant and dangerous prison is to say the least.<br>
<br>
Please note that I said it wandered off topic =)<br>
<br>
&gt;No actually I did not say that - and I note that you didnt quote me because you cant - see my rebuttel two points above. Shouting I said something at the top of your metaphorical lungs doesnt change the actual fact that I said no such thing - and have now clarified the point no less than three times.<br>
<br>
Hmm, in the arena of internet communications, one shouts by typing in all caps. A quick perusal of our respective posts will find a far greater frequency of all caps in yours than mine. Secondly, you clarify nothing by simply repeating what you’ve previously said. If you expect to rebut effectively, please give supports.<br>
<br>
&gt;Since basically everyone is forced to say it, and we have the highest crime rate in the first world, and even more than many third world countries I think this speaks for itself. I would also point out that I discussed the japanese example but apparently you cant counter that, and cite nothing yourself so again you are simply trying to shout me down rather than present anything new - nice try but no I have addressed the point.<br>
<br>
Highest crime rate in the first world? Gee, we are also the largest first world nation, have the most population, and have the most diverse populations. When differing cultures/peoples come into contact, there will be conflict, period. Show me another first world nation with the equivalent diversity, and I’ll be happier to accept the comparison.<br>
<br>
&gt;This avoids the entire issue I suppose I should expect this at this point - I will run through this again though. One - I was talking about crime rates and rates of solved crimes - the japanese may only have a fraction of our population (but its a good sized fraction) but since parrallel studies (and there have been a lot of them on various counties) look at percentages that simply is not relavent. I can understand you not knowing anything about Japan - you admit your ignorance and thats ok I have been there and my first Bachelors was in political science and far east studies, so after actually having been there (and korea) and studied there and with japanese people I may have an insight into a few things about japan.<br>
<br>
How does it avoid the issue? Your comparison was poor at best. Japan has a relatively homogenous culture. That makes things easier from an interpersonal conflict standpoint, and from a law enforcement standpoint. Solving crime is simpler when you can’t run very far. How long does it take to travel from one end of Japan to the other via auto?<br>
<br>
&gt;ok this is an interesting paragraph first you say you have no basis to dispute what I said then you do so anyway. To top it off you agree with my original point and I quote &quot;Though the average Japanese citizen may or may not have (this is arguable of course since we are not talking absolutes) the same degree of absolute liberty&quot; - Its amusing that I clearly say that the japanese may have less choices and less absolute liberty (for example all japanese must register with the local police if they move) - thanks for agreeing with my point - are you trying to actually dispute me here?<br>
<br>
Thanks for admitting that my writing is interesting. Did you actually have a point to make? You said the Japanese “may” have less choice in your original post. <br>
<br>
And do yourself a favor, please capitalize “Japanese”. It is a proper noun referring to a proud people, and not capitalizing it might insult someone of that heritage. I have Japanese ancestors and am thus of that heritage. Luckily, I’m pretty hard to insult, even when you disrespect my ancestors by not capitalizing the name of their people.<br>
<br>
&gt;Actually you made a number of personnal attacks there - and your not exactly a prize as far as spelling and strictly perfect grammer goes so I wouldn't personnally get over excited because I misspelled one letter in a latin term. Where exactly is the word &quot;stringentest&quot; in the dictionary? (let alone 'most stringentest&quot; which is right up there with most bestest as least worstest). Labelling someone with obviously derogetory terms such as &quot;deep cynicism&quot; that you tried to label me with is clearly a personnal attack. I actually believe in the fundemental good intent of man, perhaps you do not.<br>
<br>
Yup, my typing sux0rz. Still, read up on a “latin” term prior to using it. I do have to give you some credit though. You are pretty funny when you point out my lovely feck-up typing out “Stringentest” =)<br>
<br>
Now then, how is “cynicism” derogatory? Cynicism is a belief system, like any other. You are positing that cynicism is a derogatory term? I would have you know that there are many cynics out there that would be outright insulted by that line =P<br>
<br>
&gt;Not particularly no it basically was just a personnal attack that then made the sweeping statement that I dont understand &quot;human psychology on a mass scale&quot;, while your next arguement goes into matters of interpretation - two very different points (sure you bridged it with some sarcasm but that was the point).<br>
<br>
Sarcasm or not, a bridge is a bridge. I’m a Uniter, not a Divider =)<br>
<br>
Still, I say again, if you think that’s a personal attack, don’t read any of the harsh people when they post.<br>
<br>
&gt;I read your sarcasm alongside your previous personnal attack as a continuation of the same - to bad you still cant address the original point of the paragraph.<br>
<br>
You did not read the sarcasm, you assumed it. And, if you’d read the post, each major point was rebutted.<br>
<br>
&gt;Ok, now you are repeating yourself - you said almost the same thing a few paragraphs above, then you go into some rather sweeping statements about what you think I really think. Sorry but I said exactly what I think and I was quite clear about it.<br>
<br>
We’ve both repeated ourselves, and? I will say that I am impressed that you’ve replied to the post. Most people do not have the intestinal fortitude to go after such a lengthy diatribe.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok this is an interesting paragraph. It starts off with another personal attack&quot; <br>
<br>
&gt;Repeating yourself again you talked about my reply to your &quot;feigned incredulity&quot; a couple paragraphs up but now you adress it again - I can only assume you lost track of what you wanted to say and threw this in to pad your post.<br>
<br>
No need to pad. I’m wordy enough. I was reiterating the fact that you are apparently touchy.<br>
<br>
&gt;I am sorry but the entire point of this discussion is that people shouldnt be forced to utter religious plattitudes if they dont agree with them.<br>
<br>
Yes, and the big, giant point that you’ve missed time and again was that I agreed that people shouldn’t be forced to utter such.<br>
<br>
&gt;Whether you like it or not the Supreme Court is the institution that is THE authority on these matters and I would suggest that at least to this point thus far they do not agree with your particular perspective, perhaps you should examine your own falibility here. In addition after readin the federal papers and assorted other documents I came away with the impression that while the Framers had a great deal of devotion to god - they also realized that narrow minded people would always try to push their views on other people - and that this was one of the most destructive forces at large in the world today. More wars have have religious causes and overtones that any other single cause by far. (hopfully this point doesnt need clarification as well.)<br>
<br>
Question, do you know what my point is? Have you read anything anyone else has written. My first post in this thread was to agree with the 9th Circuit. You still don’t seem to catch this fact. Secondly, the SC has not actually ruled on this case, so who know with whom they agree?<br>
<br>
More wars have religious causes? Right. Wars tend, regardless of how they’re sold to the masses, to be about population pressure and money. Religion is almost always used as a motivator for the common man.<br>
<br>
&lt;As an aside, please do not confuse this as an assault on the Court. Humans are fallible.&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;This has nothing to do with the original point sure humans are fallible but they are the ones (they being the court) that ultimately decide and interpret the constitution, and I would argue that their vast experience in the field perhaps gives them a much more broad perspective than you or I. Remember that YOU brought this point up. <br>
<br>
I restate, since you missed the bloody point again, please do not confuse this as an assault on the Court. Reading Comprehension is a good thing. Try it sometimes.<br>
<br>
&amp;#61656; &quot;Still, it has been decided, occassionally by the Supreme Court but more freqeuntly by the Media and Atheists everywhere, that this is not the case.&quot; Its quite obvious that you are using the 'media' and 'atheists' as derogetory terms here and you clearly do not agree with 'them' I think that qualifies as a general attack since you dont actually point out who the &quot;Atheists everywhere&quot; are - is this some sort of conspiracy you are proposing exists?<br>
<br>
<br>
Again with the assumptions too. How precisely is it obvious that I am using “media” and “atheist” as derogatory terms? <br>
<br>
&lt;As an aside, again, this is more of an ad hominem attack than anything I wrote. I, at the least, had the decency to refute your statement instead of simply quoting them and then deriding them.&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;No you quoted them and attacked them and I returned the exact same tone and general manner if you cant take it dont dish it out.<br>
<br>
Actually, in the portion the above quote followed, you refuted nothing. You simply got snide.<br>
<br>
&gt;LOL, this was not even a luke warm flame. If you think it was a flame at all, might I direct you to read some of Salta or Ravenark's less family friendly ones as a better idea of what a flame should be.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;From the way you use the word Athiests and the colorful quotes that follow its QUITE clear you are denigrating them - I quote -<br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<br>
And it was done to introduce some levity. Humour. It was a “funny”.  That is why I chose to present in the format I did. It is intended to be ludicrous on purpose. Glad to see that you missed it.<br>
<br>
(BTW – that last line was what I call sarcasm)<br>
<br>
&gt;This is so sarcastic and derogetory it makes me wonder how you would feel if I reversed the roles and reverse your sarcastic names - would you be offended? I submit this for your perusal:<br>
&quot;<br>
Joe PushyChristian: I believe in God<br>
Jane Niceperson: How nice for you.<br>
Joe PushyChristian: You should believe in God, he does exist.<br>
Jane Niceperson: Thanks for shoving your beliefs down my throat. Someday you'll learn.<br>
Joe PushyChristian: Your refusing to say the Pledge has been shoving your beliefs down my throat for years! I'm the victim!<br>
Jane Niceperson: How nice for you. <br>
Actually, I’m not offended in the slightest. It wasn’t as funny as the one I wrote though, sorry.<br>
<br>
&lt;4) What precisely did I label the atheists?&gt;<br>
Pretty clearly this is a naughty word for you or you wouldnt be so fixated on them. Your own words as quoted and contrast above are fairly damning I dont really need to add much to them.<br>
<br>
What other word would you like me to use for the people that don’t believe in God and are suing the govt to remove “under God”? Is there a more PC term? Is “atheist” negative and hurtful?  Still, accusing someone of labeling when no label was attached is pretty odd. Labeling would be something like “All Atheist are Cowboy’s Fans”, or “All Atheists are Cheeseheads”. That is labeling. Using the word “atheist” is simply English.<br>
<br>
&gt;Yes you seem to think you mean something by it - first you claim that you dont like to have a exhaustive examination point by point of an arguement and them you proceed to do it here - so - are you therefore unfocused as well? Again, I would say to you - make up your mind please.<br>
<br>
When did I say that I didn’t like to have exhaustive arguments? If I didn’t like em, would we be this far into it?<br>
<br>
&lt;Good for you. I'm not Christian, and don't profess any sort of faith or belief in anything, much to my disappointment. I have also stated early on in this argument that the 9th Circuit Court made the right call. Did you read some part of my post that I didn't? I never said a single thing about the &quot;under God&quot; line in reference to your post.&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;No but you made other statements that to my mind make your intent fairly clear scroll up and read them again if you need to do so.<br>
<br>
Read ‘em numerous times.  I do that to make sure I am being at least basically consistent. If my intent is so clear, tell me now what you think it is.<br>
<br>
&lt;Reciting a Pledge and brainwashing are a bit different. If you cannot see this statement as true, try researching MK-ULTRA, the USSR under Stalin, Chairman Mao, Orwell's 1984, or Psycholinguistics practiced by Revivalist ministers. Reciting a Pledge once a day is socialization and might just help in building good citizens.&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;Actually I am fairly familiar with most of these issues - its amusing that YOU bring up Orwell here because mass chanting and memorization of selected text fits in well with 1984. I am sorry but socialization is interaction not rote recital of text.<br>
<br>
Yes, mass chanting figures into most of these brainwashing memes. The important point is not in the individual action, but in the entire gestalt. Mass chanting is part only. And our mass chanting is so minimal as to be inconsequential. The difference here is in degree and amount. The Pledge is a very minor form of indoctrination. Orwell’s was modification of personality by bombardment of stimuli.<br>
<br>
&lt;”The best part about this is the last line. I gave a better argument as to why the 9th Circuit was correct far earlier in the discussion, and I am somehow on the side of the &quot;under God&quot; crowd.”&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;Again read your own posts - I quoted them pretty extensively and its pretty clear how you really feel.<br>
<br>
Man, you might read, but you don’t comprehend. Just because I don’t agree with you ancillary points doesn’t mean we aren’t in line on the main issue. You don’t own the Truth all by your lonesome, bro. They say that reasonable people can disagree without becoming unreasonable, I am starting to wonder if the problem is more obvious when they agree.<br>

Ok this is a amusing example of someone repeatedly saying something then demonstrating the opposite - there where many points of substance in these posts - your just getting around to addressing most of them now, which demonstrates a certain problem with your assertions.<br>
<br>
[&gt;Ok this is classic - you clearly dont understand what equal protection under the law actually means (as enshrined by the constitution and our laws. What this means is not 'Each case must decided on its' own merit. (and the rest of the paragraph of the above section)'. Equal protection under the law means that people have the right to expect to be equally protected by the law and 'from' the law. This means that if you commit murder - you will be arrested and charged in a timely fasion, and given resonably similair cases, you should expect a reasonably similar result. This does not happen. If you commit a serious crime in the US and you are wealthy and connected you are somewhat less likely to be charged than a poor person, and typically you have a much much higher chance of being convicted if you are poor. This is FACT.<br>
<br>
Right, I don’t understand what Equal Protection means? Equal Protection statutes allow for the same basic protection under the law for each person regardless of standing. These protections are, for example, from unreasonable search and seizure, double jeopardy, cruel and unusual punishment, et al. A wealthy man is read his Miranda Rights same as a poor man. A wealthy man enjoys the benefits of the 5th Amendment much as a poor man. All have the same basic protection under the law. How do you not see this?]<br>
Thats part of equal protection but not all of it - you deliberately left off the rest of the equal protection context that I mentioned - here is an official description of the actual term and meaning since you do not understand it. <br>
&quot;<br>
Under no circumstances should the state impose additional inequalities; it should be required to deal evenly and equally with all of its people<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
[You seem to have a problem with the outcome of the trial. And? The outcome of the trial is not part of the package. Equal Protection works to keep you safe from, multiple trials, unfair evidence practices, etc. Regardless of the outcome of a trial, each person enjoys those basic protections. Those protections don’t guarantee an outcome though. If you have a problem with what these high power types do in courtrooms, remember that a jury of our peers handed down the final decision in most of these cases. Thus it is our fault.]<br>
The trial IS part of the package (note I use captalization for emphasis). I am going to do something here again that you do not do - I am going to give another real life example. In Wenachee washington a rogue police officer (who has since been fired and the state and county have been sued for millions for his actions) coerced a number of foster children to accuse people of molestyation. When the many cases went to court ALL of the cases that had non-court appointed attourneies were either tossed out or returned a not guilty verdict. The two court appointed attourney cases were both declared guilty, and were subsequently not only thrown out on appeal but the state county and city were successfully sued over the matter. The only differance here was the representation. As I stated before and you still do not get - equal protection is supposed to see that - please see the government source I quoted and read it till you understand it. As to your point about outcomes - yes they matter - sure they are not guaranteed, but the outcomes and even the sentancing are totally subject to appeal just like the rest of the totally linked process. Hence this is yet another totally false assertion. What I said was our system is a cruel joke and I clarified that it is not fair at all especially for the poor. You are still clinging to your original interpretation and ignore this yet again.<br>
<br>
[&gt;This statement has almost nothing to do with what I said but I will say this - if you are a famous movie actor and you are repeatedly busted for drug abuse and are even caught with large amounts of drugs and your name is oh say Robert Downey Jr, you can cop a plea deal quite easily and avoid jail most of the time. If your a poor black guy and you get caught with large amounts of drugs - guess whats going to happen to you. If anything you are argueing FOR my point here - the equal protection clause is supposed to prevent things like this. It is quite easy to duck the three strikes law and other such laws if you plea bargin and cop to a lesser plea. Thanks try again.<br>
<br>
Actually, for every instance of a famous person getting off on a charge, I can name you an equally famous person that got hammered for one. If you examine the stats, that “poor black guy” that you mention cops pleas quite a bit too. You just don’t see it showing up on your TV set. It happens all the time.]<br>
Crime statistics show that wealthy well represented people (as I have already said) have a much better chance of not being charged, not being tried and not being convicted (and usually get lighter sentances if they do get convicted). So again the reality of the situation is at odds with what you have said - go ahead and name me ten famous cases - There are easily ten times as many where the advantaged person gets off.<br>
<br>
[&gt;”While I am broadly disgusted by the actions of a certain high profile few in avoiding their just fate, I am not cynical enough to decry the whole concept. It is also conceivable, if one uses a shred of logic, that there are far more poor people in the world, thus it would follow that there would be more people incarcerated.” &gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;I am not sure where you get off saying this - you appear to be avoiding the point again. I NEVER decried the whole concept. YOU said I did - what I said and I quote &quot;do you folks really believe the 'liberty and justice for all' bit? While we do enjoy a large measure of liberty and to some extent justice, more so than many in the world, its pretty easy to argue that equal justice for all in this country is little more than a fairly cruel joke in reality to be honest.&quot; - there is a big differance between decrying the CONCEPT and saying that we dont live up to our claims. You will also not that I CLEARLY said &quot;..While we do enjoy a large measure of liberty and to some extent justice..&quot; so I did say we do have a measure of each. Sorry but you are totally off base here - AGAIN.<br>
<br>
Uh, Slick, you called “liberty and justice for all” a “cruel joke”. That’s pretty much decrying the whole concept. You might be more credible if you were more consistent.]<br>
Again selective quoting - I suppose if you cant counter an arguement you can twist the words - what I did say is its largely a cruel joke in this country and I clarified with my examples. That is pretty far from saying I am making a blanket statement saying that I am decrying the entire concept - again I didnt say that go read the original post or the post above where I re-quoted the original post.<br>
<br>
[&gt;Let me get this straight - you seriously believe being ostricised by some people like OJ Simpson is by some - is in any way seriously comparable to doing hard time? Pardon me but this displays a stunning lack of comprehension of how utterly unpleasant and dangerous prison is to say the least.<br>
<br>
Please note that I said it wandered off topic =)]<br>
You agree with me fine.<br>
<br>
[&gt;No actually I did not say that - and I note that you didnt quote me because you cant - see my rebuttel two points above. Shouting I said something at the top of your metaphorical lungs doesnt change the actual fact that I said no such thing - and have now clarified the point no less than three times.<br>
<br>
Hmm, in the arena of internet communications, one shouts by typing in all caps. A quick perusal of our respective posts will find a far greater frequency of all caps in yours than mine. Secondly, you clarify nothing by simply repeating what you’ve previously said. If you expect to rebut effectively, please give supports.]<br>
I gave examples and expanded on many things I have said - you in general have not - this paragraph is a good example of that - note again that I use caps for emphasis not 'shouting.'<br>
<br>
[&gt;Since basically everyone is forced to say it, and we have the highest crime rate in the first world, and even more than many third world countries I think this speaks for itself. I would also point out that I discussed the japanese example but apparently you cant counter that, and cite nothing yourself so again you are simply trying to shout me down rather than present anything new - nice try but no I have addressed the point.<br>
<br>
Highest crime rate in the first world? Gee, we are also the largest first world nation, have the most population, and have the most diverse populations. When differing cultures/peoples come into contact, there will be conflict, period. Show me another first world nation with the equivalent diversity, and I’ll be happier to accept the comparison.]<br>
Actually though it has indivudual sub-identities you will note that-<br>
1) the European Union is the largest first world country with the largest population and a much more diverse set of populations, races and identities than our own - please familiarize yourself with the various EU treaties if you do not understand this. The EU Fedral system is very much like the original strong states rights framework originally set up by our founding fathers. It is relatively recent that the federal goverment has subsumed states rights to the extent we have now.<br>
2) The EU as a whole has a lower rate of crime (note again I am talking percentages and statistics that allow you to compare populations regardless of size), and in particular a lower rate of violent crime.<br>
3) In point of fact both japan and the EU have much higher population densities than the US.<br>
<br>
[&gt;This avoids the entire issue I suppose I should expect this at this point - I will run through this again though. One - I was talking about crime rates and rates of solved crimes - the japanese may only have a fraction of our population (but its a good sized fraction) but since parrallel studies (and there have been a lot of them on various counties) look at percentages that simply is not relavent. I can understand you not knowing anything about Japan - you admit your ignorance and thats ok I have been there and my first Bachelors was in political science and far east studies, so after actually having been there (and korea) and studied there and with japanese people I may have an insight into a few things about japan.<br>
<br>
How does it avoid the issue? Your comparison was poor at best. Japan has a relatively homogenous culture. That makes things easier from an interpersonal conflict standpoint, and from a law enforcement standpoint. Solving crime is simpler when you can’t run very far. How long does it take to travel from one end of Japan to the other via auto?]<br>
Again I am sorry you are not that familiar with japanese culture - though it is relatively racially homogenous there are huge economic stratifications in the counrty and actually in point of fact class separations (you do know about the untouchables right?). Add large amounts of foreign workers to the mix and it is certainly a valid comparison. <br>
<br>
[&gt;ok this is an interesting paragraph first you say you have no basis to dispute what I said then you do so anyway. To top it off you agree with my original point and I quote &quot;Though the average Japanese citizen may or may not have (this is arguable of course since we are not talking absolutes) the same degree of absolute liberty&quot; - Its amusing that I clearly say that the japanese may have less choices and less absolute liberty (for example all japanese must register with the local police if they move) - thanks for agreeing with my point - are you trying to actually dispute me here?<br>
<br>
Thanks for admitting that my writing is interesting. Did you actually have a point to make? You said the Japanese “may” have less choice in your original post.]<br>
Yes I had a point, I said it was argueable whether the japanese had the same measure of individual liberties we enjoy - you then told a story about your granny who seemed to agree with my point - I replied and asked you to explain what your point was and you still have not dont it.<br>
<br>
[And do yourself a favor, please capitalize “Japanese”. It is a proper noun referring to a proud people, and not capitalizing it might insult someone of that heritage. I have Japanese ancestors and am thus of that heritage. Luckily, I’m pretty hard to insult, even when you disrespect my ancestors by not capitalizing the name of their people.]<br>
Back to grammer - as I already have shown your not 'the most bestest' and perfect grammer, so you gain little by going into it - if you want to interpret me not capitalizing the word japanese as an insult I submit that this is your problem and it doesnt really bother me.<br>
<br>
[&gt;Actually you made a number of personnal attacks there - and your not exactly a prize as far as spelling and strictly perfect grammer goes so I wouldn't personnally get over excited because I misspelled one letter in a latin term. Where exactly is the word &quot;stringentest&quot; in the dictionary? (let alone 'most stringentest&quot; which is right up there with most bestest as least worstest). Labelling someone with obviously derogetory terms such as &quot;deep cynicism&quot; that you tried to label me with is clearly a personnal attack. I actually believe in the fundemental good intent of man, perhaps you do not.<br>
<br>
Yup, my typing sux0rz. Still, read up on a “latin” term prior to using it. I do have to give you some credit though. You are pretty funny when you point out my lovely feck-up typing out “Stringentest” =)]<br>
Fair enough.<br>
<br>
[Now then, how is “cynicism” derogatory? Cynicism is a belief system, like any other. You are positing that cynicism is a derogatory term? I would have you know that there are many cynics out there that would be outright insulted by that line =P]<br>
Labels are an insult - calling someone names is an insult, I said this go re-read the post, if you think labels are not insulting I can easily demonstrate how wrong you are but I doubt you really want to go there.<br>
<br>
[&gt;Not particularly no it basically was just a personnal attack that then made the sweeping statement that I dont understand &quot;human psychology on a mass scale&quot;, while your next arguement goes into matters of interpretation - two very different points (sure you bridged it with some sarcasm but that was the point).<br>
<br>
Sarcasm or not, a bridge is a bridge. I’m a Uniter, not a Divider =)<br>
<br>
Still, I say again, if you think that’s a personal attack, don’t read any of the harsh people when they post.]<br>
Nah I like flame posts I just think its funny that you dress up a flame and psuedo logic as a valid counter-point.<br>
<br>
[&gt;I read your sarcasm alongside your previous personnal attack as a continuation of the same - to bad you still cant address the original point of the paragraph.<br>
<br>
You did not read the sarcasm, you assumed it. And, if you’d read the post, each major point was rebutted.]<br>
This is patently false - do I really need to demonstrate this again? Heck, originally you didnt even respond line by line like this because it wasnt 'focused.'<br>
<br>
[&gt;Ok, now you are repeating yourself - you said almost the same thing a few paragraphs above, then you go into some rather sweeping statements about what you think I really think. Sorry but I said exactly what I think and I was quite clear about it.<br>
<br>
We’ve both repeated ourselves, and? I will say that I am impressed that you’ve replied to the post. Most people do not have the intestinal fortitude to go after such a lengthy diatribe.]<br>
I like being complete, it yeilds closure.<br>
<br>
[&quot;Ok this is an interesting paragraph. It starts off with another personal attack&quot; <br>
<br>
&gt;Repeating yourself again you talked about my reply to your &quot;feigned incredulity&quot; a couple paragraphs up but now you adress it again - I can only assume you lost track of what you wanted to say and threw this in to pad your post.<br>
<br>
No need to pad. I’m wordy enough. I was reiterating the fact that you are apparently touchy.]<br>
I think 4 paragraphs about the same topic one after another repeating a responce to one paragraph (actually one point of that paragraph) is pretty obviously padding. Sure you probably didnt mean to do it, and I think I said that I thought you lost track of what you wanted to say.<br>
<br>
[&gt;I am sorry but the entire point of this discussion is that people shouldnt be forced to utter religious plattitudes if they dont agree with them.<br>
<br>
Yes, and the big, giant point that you’ve missed time and again was that I agreed that people shouldn’t be forced to utter such.]<br>
No I didnt miss the point that you said you did this - I just differ with your preception of the subject and how you justifiy yourself and I said as much.<br>
<br>
[&gt;Whether you like it or not the Supreme Court is the institution that is THE authority on these matters and I would suggest that at least to this point thus far they do not agree with your particular perspective, perhaps you should examine your own falibility here. In addition after readin the federal papers and assorted other documents I came away with the impression that while the Framers had a great deal of devotion to god - they also realized that narrow minded people would always try to push their views on other people - and that this was one of the most destructive forces at large in the world today. More wars have have religious causes and overtones that any other single cause by far. (hopfully this point doesnt need clarification as well.)<br>
<br>
Question, do you know what my point is? Have you read anything anyone else has written. My first post in this thread was to agree with the 9th Circuit. You still don’t seem to catch this fact. Secondly, the SC has not actually ruled on this case, so who know with whom they agree?]<br>
Yes I saw your original post - the supreme court is almost sure to become involved in this at some point, but that was not why mentioned it. In point of fact - you were the one ranting about the falibility of man and how the court (by implication) has strayed from the intent of the framers. This demonstated a fundemental lack of understanding about how the court system works and I took you to task about it.<br>
<br>
[More wars have religious causes? Right. Wars tend, regardless of how they’re sold to the masses, to be about population pressure and money. Religion is almost always used as a motivator for the common man.]<br>
Actually nationalism (and tribalism)  tends to be one of the main driving forces of conflict - people useually only get into really bloodly and sustained wars over matters of religion though because of 'god' being on their side. You dont really seem to be disagreeing with this point though so I will leave it at that - feel free to read up on irish history, middle eastern history and some of the other religious wars of europe (such as the 30 years war) if you really want to get into it though.<br>
<br>
[&lt;As an aside, please do not confuse this as an assault on the Court. Humans are fallible.&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;This has nothing to do with the original point sure humans are fallible but they are the ones (they being the court) that ultimately decide and interpret the constitution, and I would argue that their vast experience in the field perhaps gives them a much more broad perspective than you or I. Remember that YOU brought this point up. <br>
<br>
I restate, since you missed the bloody point again, please do not confuse this as an assault on the Court. Reading Comprehension is a good thing. Try it sometimes.]<br>
No I did not miss the point - and I did not think that you were 'assaulting' the court - what I was suprised by was your lack of understanding of how the court system and the supreme court works though, and its ultimate duty in our governmental system.<br>
<br>
[&amp;#61656; &quot;Still, it has been decided, occassionally by the Supreme Court but more freqeuntly by the Media and Atheists everywhere, that this is not the case.&quot; Its quite obvious that you are using the 'media' and 'atheists' as derogetory terms here and you clearly do not agree with 'them' I think that qualifies as a general attack since you dont actually point out who the &quot;Atheists everywhere&quot; are - is this some sort of conspiracy you are proposing exists?<br>
<br>
<br>
Again with the assumptions too. How precisely is it obvious that I am using “media” and “atheist” as derogatory terms?]<br>
In context with your Jane American vs Joe Atheist remarks it was fairly obvious. Obviously a good american aint that rude mean old athiest.<br>
<br>
[&lt;As an aside, again, this is more of an ad hominem attack than anything I wrote. I, at the least, had the decency to refute your statement instead of simply quoting them and then deriding them.&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;No you quoted them and attacked them and I returned the exact same tone and general manner if you cant take it dont dish it out.<br>
<br>
Actually, in the portion the above quote followed, you refuted nothing. You simply got snide.]<br>
Well we can agree that this is your point of view however scewed it is.<br>
<br>
[&gt;LOL, this was not even a luke warm flame. If you think it was a flame at all, might I direct you to read some of Salta or Ravenark's less family friendly ones as a better idea of what a flame should be.<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;From the way you use the word Athiests and the colorful quotes that follow its QUITE clear you are denigrating them - I quote -<br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<br>
And it was done to introduce some levity. Humour. It was a “funny”. That is why I chose to present in the format I did. It is intended to be ludicrous on purpose. Glad to see that you missed it.]<br>
No I didnt think it was funny - you painted athiests as rude bigots who are all out to push their views and implied that they are unamerican - again I sumbit that it is YOU making the rude blanket assertions, and that quote rather amply demonstrated the fact.<br>
<br>
(BTW – that last line was what I call sarcasm)<br>
<br>
[&gt;This is so sarcastic and derogetory it makes me wonder how you would feel if I reversed the roles and reverse your sarcastic names - would you be offended? I submit this for your perusal:<br>
&quot;<br>
Joe PushyChristian: I believe in God<br>
Jane Niceperson: How nice for you.<br>
Joe PushyChristian: You should believe in God, he does exist.<br>
Jane Niceperson: Thanks for shoving your beliefs down my throat. Someday you'll learn.<br>
Joe PushyChristian: Your refusing to say the Pledge has been shoving your beliefs down my throat for years! I'm the victim!<br>
Jane Niceperson: How nice for you. <br>
Actually, I’m not offended in the slightest. It wasn’t as funny as the one I wrote though, sorry.<br>
<br>
&lt;4) What precisely did I label the atheists?&gt;<br>
Pretty clearly this is a naughty word for you or you wouldnt be so fixated on them. Your own words as quoted and contrast above are fairly damning I dont really need to add much to them.<br>
<br>
What other word would you like me to use for the people that don’t believe in God and are suing the govt to remove “under God”? Is there a more PC term? Is “atheist” negative and hurtful? Still, accusing someone of labeling when no label was attached is pretty odd. Labeling would be something like “All Atheist are Cowboy’s Fans”, or “All Atheists are Cheeseheads”. That is labeling. Using the word “atheist” is simply English.]<br>
No a good example of labeling is presenting two people and labeling one as american and the other as something else and then implying in a general way certain attributes and behaviors - you did exactly this - here is a definition of the term label since you dont understand it - note that lebeling doesnt have to be overt. Note that your useage clearly falls under item two.<br>
&quot;<br>
1 - An item used to identify something or someone, as a small piece of paper or cloth attached to an article to designate its origin, owner, contents, use, or destination. <br>
2 - A descriptive term; an epithet. <br>
3 - A distinctive name or trademark identifying a product or manufacturer, especially a recording company. <br>
<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
[&gt;Yes you seem to think you mean something by it - first you claim that you dont like to have a exhaustive examination point by point of an arguement and them you proceed to do it here - so - are you therefore unfocused as well? Again, I would say to you - make up your mind please.<br>
<br>
When did I say that I didn’t like to have exhaustive arguments? If I didn’t like em, would we be this far into it?]<br>
No, and this was one of my points - there is such a thing as a good arguement and such as thing as an arguement for the sake of arguement.<br>
<br>
[&lt;Good for you. I'm not Christian, and don't profess any sort of faith or belief in anything, much to my disappointment. I have also stated early on in this argument that the 9th Circuit Court made the right call. Did you read some part of my post that I didn't? I never said a single thing about the &quot;under God&quot; line in reference to your post.&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;No but you made other statements that to my mind make your intent fairly clear scroll up and read them again if you need to do so.<br>
<br>
&lt;Read ‘em numerous times. I do that to make sure I am being at least basically consistent. If my intent is so clear, tell me now what you think it is.&gt;]<br>
Re-read till you figure it out - sorry but I cant really help you if you cant even accept the common paradigm for very basic and fundemental terms such as 'religion.'<br>
<br>
[&lt;Reciting a Pledge and brainwashing are a bit different. If you cannot see this statement as true, try researching MK-ULTRA, the USSR under Stalin, Chairman Mao, Orwell's 1984, or Psycholinguistics practiced by Revivalist ministers. Reciting a Pledge once a day is socialization and might just help in building good citizens.&gt;<br>
<br>
&gt;Actually I am fairly familiar with most of these issues - its amusing that YOU bring up Orwell here because mass chanting and memorization of selected text fits in well with 1984. I am sorry but socialization is interaction not rote recital of text.<br>
<br>
Yes, mass chanting figures into most of these brainwashing memes. The important point is not in the individual action, but in the entire gestalt. Mass chanting is part only. And our mass chanting is so minimal as to be inconsequential. The difference here is in degree and amount. The Pledge is a very minor form of indoctrination. Orwell’s was modification of personality by bombardment of stimuli.]<br>
No this is one aspect of the indoctrinization - we get plenty more thats why its so alarming. This was the point, but in general you dont seem to disagree so I dont need to say much more about it.<br>
<br>
[&lt;”The best part about this is the last line. I gave a better argument as to why the 9th Circuit was correct far earlier in the discussion, and I am somehow on the side of the &quot;under God&quot; crowd.”&gt;]<br>
Again I think you may or may not agree with the 9th circuit but this wasnt the point of my posts, I will continue to take issue with whatever aspects of whatever statements you or anyone make if I feel like taking the time to do it. Dont try to tell me I cant critisize your thought process if I dont feel like it - your in the wrong place for that.<br>
<br>
&gt;Again read your own posts - I quoted them pretty extensively and its pretty clear how you really feel.<br>
<br>
[Man, you might read, but you don’t comprehend. Just because I don’t agree with you ancillary points doesn’t mean we aren’t in line on the main issue. You don’t own the Truth all by your lonesome, bro. They say that reasonable people can disagree without becoming unreasonable, I am starting to wonder if the problem is more obvious when they agree.]<br>
Actually I read quite well in both english and german, and as far as comprehension goes, its quite clear from the fact that you lack basic understanding of some of the fundemental terms you use (again I think the term religion is a good example of this) makes it difficult to even agree to a basic framework with which to have a discussion. So be it.<br>

&gt;Actually it is possible to use different fonts and certainly if you include a bitmap signiture - note that you brought the point of spelling up here - and I replied that to actually spell most nordic words correctly you need to use a Nordic font to be strictly correct.<br>
<br>
Actually, you mentioned this Nordic font silliness well before any of the spelling jibes. You have still yet to answer how I would use a Nordic font in EQ where the name is based. As far as using Nordic fonts only, true, if you wish to be precise. I did say quite a while back that I spelled the name phonetically on purpose.<br>

&gt;[Actually, I said that you’d said little of substance. There is a difference. The core issue, whether or not the phrase “with Liberty and Justice for all” was very much addressed. Again, reread the post.]<br>
<br>
&gt;Ok this is a amusing example of someone repeatedly saying something then demonstrating the opposite - there where many points of substance in these posts - your just getting around to addressing most of them now, which demonstrates a certain problem with your assertions.<br>
<br>
You fail to make yourself clear. I’ve addressed the various points all along. I would say something about referring to them, but I am tired of advising you to reread posts when you obviously either do not wish to or cannot comprehend them once you do.<br>

&gt;[Right, I don’t understand what Equal Protection means? Equal Protection statutes allow for the same basic protection under the law for each person regardless of standing. These protections are, for example, from unreasonable search and seizure, double jeopardy, cruel and unusual punishment, et al. A wealthy man is read his Miranda Rights same as a poor man. A wealthy man enjoys the benefits of the 5th Amendment much as a poor man. All have the same basic protection under the law. How do you not see this?]<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;Thats part of equal protection but not all of it - you deliberately left off the rest of the equal protection context that I mentioned - here is an official description of the actual term and meaning since you do not understand it. <br>
<br>
You are very assumptive today =)<br>
&amp;#61656; Under no circumstances should the state impose additional inequalities; it should be required to deal evenly and equally with all of its people<br>
<br>
You cite this line without telling us where it is from. The assumption is that it is from the Constitution, Declaration of Independence, or some other official document underlying our country. Not being satisfied with assumptions, I looked it up. Best source I can find says that it was written by a legal scholar named John P. Franks. I don’t know Franks, haven’t read him. The problem with this line is that the States have not imposed any additional inequalities in the example you gave earlier. The State of California did not impose any sort of boon or hindrance on O.J. Simpson, nor did it do so with the Menendez brothers. It could be argued, in the case of Robert Blake, that he is being dealt with more harshly due to his status. He has been denied bail even when he fits poorly with the characteristics of a flight risk.<br>
<br>
Now, call me crazy, but, seeing as how this wasn’t written by our Framers or as part of US Code, how is this an “official description”?<br>
<br>
&gt;The trial IS part of the package (note I use captalization for emphasis). I am going to do something here again that you do not do - I am going to give another real life example. In Wenachee washington a rogue police officer (who has since been fired and the state and county have been sued for millions for his actions) coerced a number of foster children to accuse people of molestyation. When the many cases went to court ALL of the cases that had non-court appointed attourneies were either tossed out or returned a not guilty verdict. The two court appointed attourney cases were both declared guilty, and were subsequently not only thrown out on appeal but the state county and city were successfully sued over the matter. The only differance here was the representation. As I stated before and you still do not get - equal protection is supposed to see that - please see the government source I quoted and read it till you understand it. As to your point about outcomes - yes they matter - sure they are not guaranteed, but the outcomes and even the sentancing are totally subject to appeal just like the rest of the totally linked process. Hence this is yet another totally false assertion. What I said was our system is a cruel joke and I clarified that it is not fair at all especially for the poor. You are still clinging to your original interpretation and ignore this yet again.<br>
<br>
Nice example, except for the lack of names, lack of details, and simplistic way you gloss over it. Still, should I choose to accept your example at face value as true, my first question would be to ask for specifics and details. If this officer has since been fired and prosecuted, why were those guilty verdicts not overturned? What happened to the verdicts when they were appealed? <br>
<br>
What is your alternative to Public Defenders, since you decry them so much? Would it be better to just do away with Public Defenders and let the poor defend themselves? Perhaps we should take away the freedom of those high-dollar competent attorneys and make them take cases pro bono? What is the alternative? The system exists to provide a modicum of protection to the indigent. Frankly were I to get arrested for something, I would not have access to a Public Defender as my income is likely too high. This is a case of reverse discrimination. I continue to not see what is so wrong with a system that provides you with a defense when you cannot afford one, yet allows you the freedom to pick your own defender should you be capable. Again, how would you fix this? <br>
<br>
&gt;[Actually, for every instance of a famous person getting off on a charge, I can name you an equally famous person that got hammered for one. If you examine the stats, that “poor black guy” that you mention cops pleas quite a bit too. You just don’t see it showing up on your TV set. It happens all the time.]<br>
<br>
&gt;Crime statistics show that wealthy well represented people (as I have already said) have a much better chance of not being charged, not being tried and not being convicted (and usually get lighter sentances if they do get convicted). So again the reality of the situation is at odds with what you have said - go ahead and name me ten famous cases - There are easily ten times as many where the advantaged person gets off.<br>
<br>
Statistics are highly suspect when such a limited pool of instances as “advantaged” persons are the pool the statistic is drawn from. Some examples would be Mike Tyson – rape, Zack de La Rocha – possession with intent to distribute, Hugh Grant – soliciting, Robert Downey Jr has done time for possession, Fatty Arbuckle – rape, Peter Buck (REM) – Air Rage, Tim Allen – distribution of cocaine, James Brown – 5 yrs in jail total for numerous offenses, Mike Skakel (a Kennedy!) – murder, Robert Durst (millionaire) – murder, Leopold and Loeb- both wealthy young men from influential families – murder, Claus von Bulow – murder, Michael Fletcher (high-dollar lawyer) – murder, and the list goes on….<br>
<br>
&gt;[Uh, Slick, you called “liberty and justice for all” a “cruel joke”. That’s pretty much decrying the whole concept. You might be more credible if you were more consistent.]<br>
<br>
&gt;Again selective quoting - I suppose if you cant counter an arguement you can twist the words - what I did say is its largely a cruel joke in this country and I clarified with my examples. That is pretty far from saying I am making a blanket statement saying that I am decrying the entire concept - again I didnt say that go read the original post or the post above where I re-quoted the original post.<br>
<br>
/nod<br>
/smile<br>
At this point, I am thinking more and more that you have divorced yourself from the reality even of your own posts. I will simply start any further posts directed at you with an admonition to return to previous posts and read them objectively.<br>
<br>
&gt;[Please note that I said it wandered off topic =)]<br>
<br>
&gt;You agree with me fine.<br>
<br>
No, I said that I’d wandered off topic. However, if it will do your ego a good turn to think that we are in agreement here, I won’t argue with you. We are in something of an agreement, though it is a weak and unhealthy one, prone to long bouts of illness.<br>
<br>
&gt;[Hmm, in the arena of internet communications, one shouts by typing in all caps. A quick perusal of our respective posts will find a far greater frequency of all caps in yours than mine. Secondly, you clarify nothing by simply repeating what you’ve previously said. If you expect to rebut effectively, please give supports.]<br>
<br>
&gt;I gave examples and expanded on many things I have said - you in general have not - this paragraph is a good example of that - note again that I use caps for emphasis not 'shouting.'<br>
<br>
You have also made many, many unsupported statements. And, though it causes me to descend to your level of pluralist definition, it is commonly accepted in this medium, that use of all caps is shouting. You may not intend it as such, but it is certainly read that way.<br>
<br>
&gt;[Highest crime rate in the first world? Gee, we are also the largest first world nation, have the most population, and have the most diverse populations. When differing cultures/peoples come into contact, there will be conflict, period. Show me another first world nation with the equivalent diversity, and I’ll be happier to accept the comparison.]<br>
<br>
&gt;Actually though it has indivudual sub-identities you will note that-<br>
1) the European Union is the largest first world country with the largest population and a much more diverse set of populations, races and identities than our own - please familiarize yourself with the various EU treaties if you do not understand this. The EU Fedral system is very much like the original strong states rights framework originally set up by our founding fathers. It is relatively recent that the federal goverment has subsumed states rights to the extent we have now.<br>
<br>
LOL, calling the EU a single nation would like calling the US and Mexico a single nation since NAFTA.<br>
<br>
2) The EU as a whole has a lower rate of crime (note again I am talking percentages and statistics that allow you to compare populations regardless of size), and in particular a lower rate of violent crime.<br>
<br>
Again, the countries within the EU, excuse me, individual sub-indentities within the EU (ROFL) are stil far more homogenous than the US within their own individual sub-identity’s (ROFLMAO) borders. Homogeneity of culture and race is incredible pertinent to this discussion, and your individual sub-identityies (this phrase is killing me) are not good examples as a result.<br>
3) In point of fact both japan and the EU have much higher population densities than the US.<br>
<br>
Only when compared to the whole. If you compare the EU to the original Confederation that the US operated under in the time of the Framers, you should thus take the States to be the individual sub-indentities (/snicker) that you call the nations of Europe. Numerous individual sub-identities in this nation have populations densities equivalent to Europe and Japan. They also posses a far greater amount of diversity as well. <br>
<br>
I’ve noticed that you keep stridently avoiding that whole diversity thing.<br>
<br>
&gt;[How does it avoid the issue? Your comparison was poor at best. Japan has a relatively homogenous culture. That makes things easier from an interpersonal conflict standpoint, and from a law enforcement standpoint. Solving crime is simpler when you can’t run very far. How long does it take to travel from one end of Japan to the other via auto?]<br>
<br>
&gt;Again I am sorry you are not that familiar with japanese culture - though it is relatively racially homogenous there are huge economic stratifications in the counrty and actually in point of fact class separations (you do know about the untouchables right?). Add large amounts of foreign workers to the mix and it is certainly a valid comparison. <br>
<br>
I know quite well about the Untouchables. I still defy you to show an equivalent level of diversity when compared to, say, New York City. And to imply that Japan has economic stratifications that we do not is laughable. The is the same disparity of income here.<br>
<br>
&gt;[Thanks for admitting that my writing is interesting. Did you actually have a point to make? You said the Japanese “may” have less choice in your original post.]<br>
<br>
&gt;Yes I had a point, I said it was argueable whether the japanese had the same measure of individual liberties we enjoy - you then told a story about your granny who seemed to agree with my point - I replied and asked you to explain what your point was and you still have not dont it.<br>
<br>
No, my Grandmother was well known to say that she had more choices and thus more liberty here. Please reread. Doh! I went and said “reread” again…<br>
<br>
&gt;Back to grammer - as I already have shown your not 'the most bestest' and perfect grammer, so you gain little by going into it - if you want to interpret me not capitalizing the word japanese as an insult I submit that this is your problem and it doesnt really bother me.<br>
<br>
Not a question of grammar, one of respect. By showing that you have none, you show that you deserve none.<br>
<br>
&gt;[Yup, my typing sux0rz. Still, read up on a “latin” term prior to using it. I do have to give you some credit though. You are pretty funny when you point out my lovely feck-up typing out “Stringentest” =)]<br>
<br>
&gt;Fair enough.<br>
<br>
I, contrary to how some portray me,. Try damned hard to be fair. This is much more than I can say for most.<br>
<br>
&gt;[Now then, how is “cynicism” derogatory? Cynicism is a belief system, like any other. You are positing that cynicism is a derogatory term? I would have you know that there are many cynics out there that would be outright insulted by that line =P]<br>
<br>
&gt;Labels are an insult - calling someone names is an insult, I said this go re-read the post, if you think labels are not insulting I can easily demonstrate how wrong you are but I doubt you really want to go there.<br>
<br>
Wow, the sarcasm in the above line simply flew right by you. It didn’t even ruffle your hair. Amazing.<br>
<br>
To rebut your posit though, it insults you if I label you, say, an ezBoard User? Damn, you are touchy. Well, after that line about how the Japanese people don’t rate a proper noun, maybe I should insult you some more. Fkin, you’re also an EQ Player, and you are a Left Coasty, and you are an English-speaker, ooh ooh, I have a good one, you are a Human! Ha! Man, you must be absolutely insulted to the core after seeing me label you so much. Please don’t report me to the Admins!<br>
<br>
&gt;[Sarcasm or not, a bridge is a bridge. I’m a Uniter, not a Divider =)<br>
Still, I say again, if you think that’s a personal attack, don’t read any of the harsh people when they post.]<br>
<br>
&gt;Nah I like flame posts I just think its funny that you dress up a flame and psuedo logic as a valid counter-point.<br>
<br>
Glad I’m helping face your day with a smile on your face, cause you sure seem pretty grim to me =)<br>
<br>
&gt;[You did not read the sarcasm, you assumed it. And, if you’d read the post, each major point was rebutted.]<br>
<br>
&gt;This is patently false - do I really need to demonstrate this again? Heck, originally you didnt even respond line by line like this because it wasnt 'focused.'<br>
<br>
Sure, demonstrate it again. I want to see how you do something “again” when you haven’t doen it the first time.<br>
<br>
&gt;[We’ve both repeated ourselves, and? I will say that I am impressed that you’ve replied to the post. Most people do not have the intestinal fortitude to go after such a lengthy diatribe.]<br>
<br>
&gt;I like being complete, it yeilds closure.<br>
<br>
Closure? Aroo? We will never see closure at this rate. We will just keep chewing on each other…<br>
<br>
Bulvai: Reread the post.<br>
Fkin: You missed the point.<br>
Repeat as necessary.<br>
<br>
&gt;[No need to pad. I’m wordy enough. I was reiterating the fact that you are apparently touchy.]<br>
<br>
&gt;I think 4 paragraphs about the same topic one after another repeating a responce to one paragraph (actually one point of that paragraph) is pretty obviously padding. Sure you probably didnt mean to do it, and I think I said that I thought you lost track of what you wanted to say.<br>
<br>
Nah, I had perfect track of what I was saying. I’m just wordy.<br>
<br>
(Fkin)&gt;[&gt;I am sorry but the entire point of this discussion is that people shouldnt be forced to utter religious plattitudes if they dont agree with them.<br>
<br>
(Me) &gt;[Yes, and the big, giant point that you’ve missed time and again was that I agreed that people shouldn’t be forced to utter such.]<br>
<br>
(Fkin, round 2) &gt;No I didnt miss the point that you said you did this - I just differ with your preception of the subject and how you justifiy yourself and I said as much.<br>
<br>
Look at what you wrote above.  I’m quoting it for you. Look at what I said after. You state that the whole point of the discussion is the “forced to utter” issue. I have said numerous times that we are on the same page. You then tell me I am wrong and that the issue now includes perception and justification differences. Haven’t I already asked for consistency enough to warrant just a little?<br>
<br>
&gt;[Question, do you know what my point is? Have you read anything anyone else has written. My first post in this thread was to agree with the 9th Circuit. You still don’t seem to catch this fact. Secondly, the SC has not actually ruled on this case, so who know with whom they agree?]<br>
<br>
&gt;Yes I saw your original post - the supreme court is almost sure to become involved in this at some point, but that was not why mentioned it. In point of fact - you were the one ranting about the falibility of man and how the court (by implication) has strayed from the intent of the framers. This demonstated a fundemental lack of understanding about how the court system works and I took you to task about it.<br>
<br>
You are well and truly clueless here. (and that’s just a personal attack, not an ad hominem). I included a comment that this was not to be construed as an assault on the Court. You continue to assault me for an imagined assault on the Court. How do I lack understanding of the Court when all I said was that humans are fallible, the Court is made of humans, thus the Court is fallible? Are you not aware of the Impeachment process by which a Justice can be removed from the Court? Does it not follow that, if the law has some mechanism in place to remove a bad Justice, that even the law realizes that they are fallible? Could you possibly have less comprehension?<br>
<br>
&gt;[More wars have religious causes? Right. Wars tend, regardless of how they’re sold to the masses, to be about population pressure and money. Religion is almost always used as a motivator for the common man.]<br>
<br>
&gt;Actually nationalism (and tribalism) tends to be one of the main driving forces of conflict - people useually only get into really bloodly and sustained wars over matters of religion though because of 'god' being on their side. You dont really seem to be disagreeing with this point though so I will leave it at that - feel free to read up on irish history, middle eastern history and some of the other religious wars of europe (such as the 30 years war) if you really want to get into it though.<br>
<br>
Don’t you have a degree in History? I seem to recall most of the Crusades being precipitated by European traders being attacked on trade routes in Outremere. The Christian pilgrims would get attacked and the European courts would gnash their teeth, but they never seemed to step in until the spice/silk/etc trade was disrupted.<br>
<br>
And if you think that the bloody wars were religious ones only, your History professors must have not mentioned the first World War.<br>
<br>
&gt;[I restate, since you missed the bloody point again, please do not confuse this as an assault on the Court. Reading Comprehension is a good thing. Try it sometimes.]<br>
<br>
&gt;No I did not miss the point - and I did not think that you were 'assaulting' the court - what I was suprised by was your lack of understanding of how the court system and the supreme court works though, and its ultimate duty in our governmental system.<br>
<br>
I covered this earlier in this post. Won’t pointlessly reiterate.<br>
<br>
&gt;[Again with the assumptions too. How precisely is it obvious that I am using “media” and “atheist” as derogatory terms?]<br>
&gt;In context with your Jane American vs Joe Atheist remarks it was fairly obvious. Obviously a good american aint that rude mean old athiest.<br>
<br>
LOL, first, you fail to include the media in that explanation. Secondly, I chose “Jane American” as the appellation for the opposition for a number of reasons. The first, and most important, was because it might’ve insulted our Christian friends here if I’d called her Jane Christian. Unlike you, I dislike randomly insulting average people. I much prefer accidentally insulting overly touchy people with innocent comments. The second reason was precisely to counterpoint the difference between “Joe Atheist” and the average American. The line was drawn by the atheist, in the example of Newdow.<br>
<br>
&gt;[Actually, in the portion the above quote followed, you refuted nothing. You simply got snide.]<br>
<br>
&gt;Well we can agree that this is your point of view however scewed it is.<br>
<br>
Lookee there, yet another pointless denial without the benefit of support. You have mad debate sk33lz.<br>
<br>
&gt;[And it was done to introduce some levity. Humour. It was a “funny”. That is why I chose to present in the format I did. It is intended to be ludicrous on purpose. Glad to see that you missed it.]<br>
<br>
&gt;No I didnt think it was funny - you painted athiests as rude bigots who are all out to push their views and implied that they are unamerican - again I sumbit that it is YOU making the rude blanket assertions, and that quote rather amply demonstrated the fact.<br>
<br>
You know why you didn’t think it was funny? Because you are touchy. You assume that I painted atheist as un-American. Frankly, it wouldn’t have mattered how I portrayed them. You would’ve found something to get insulted by. Why? Because you are touchy.<br>
<br>
&gt;[What other word would you like me to use for the people that don’t believe in God and are suing the govt to remove “under God”? Is there a more PC term? Is “atheist” negative and hurtful? Still, accusing someone of labeling when no label was attached is pretty odd. Labeling would be something like “All Atheist are Cowboy’s Fans”, or “All Atheists are Cheeseheads”. That is labeling. Using the word “atheist” is simply English.]<br>
<br>
&gt;No a good example of labeling is presenting two people and labeling one as american and the other as something else and then implying in a general way certain attributes and behaviors - you did exactly this - here is a definition of the term label since you dont understand it - note that lebeling doesnt have to be overt. Note that your useage clearly falls under item two.<br>
<br>
LOL. Right, now I am labelling by not labelling. I am labelling in the negative. Fear me.<br>
<br>
1 - An item used to identify something or someone, as a small piece of paper or cloth attached to an article to designate its origin, owner, contents, use, or destination. <br>
2 - A descriptive term; an epithet. <br>
3 - A distinctive name or trademark identifying a product or manufacturer, especially a recording company. <br>
<br>
You are simply hard for this dictionary, aren’t you? Let me give you a hint, if I am guilty of labelling, and the definition you choose to use is that broad, you are the pot calling the kettle black.<br>
<br>
Here is a quick list of things you’ve labelled:<br>
Japanese – label<br>
Atheists – label<br>
American – label<br>
Un-American – label<br>
Bigots - label<br>
<br>
Ouch, you’ve been really insulting with all of these labels. How can you live with yourself?<br>
<br>
(Fkin)[&gt;Yes you seem to think you mean something by it - first you claim that you dont like to have a exhaustive examination point by point of an arguement and them you proceed to do it here - so - are you therefore unfocused as well? Again, I would say to you - make up your mind please.<br>
<br>
&gt;[When did I say that I didn’t like to have exhaustive arguments? If I didn’t like em, would we be this far into it?]<br>
<br>
&gt;No, and this was one of my points - there is such a thing as a good arguement and such as thing as an arguement for the sake of arguement.<br>
<br>
There ya go not supporting again. You accuse me, in the first quote, of saying that I didn’t like exhaustive arguments. I call you on that in my quote. You then attempt to switch focus away from your gaffe in the third quote. Sorry, Slick, you blew it in this one. You did not offer any support whatsoever and attempted to switch gears. Sadly, the gear switching wasn’t even good. You’ve never mentioned anything about good argument vs argument for argument sake. <br>
<br>
Is that a line from some imaginary continuation of this argument where you actually do support you counterpoints?<br>
<br>
<br>
&gt;&lt;Read ‘em numerous times. I do that to make sure I am being at least basically consistent. If my intent is so clear, tell me now what you think it is.&gt;]<br>
<br>
&gt;Re-read till you figure it out - sorry but I cant really help you if you cant even accept the common paradigm for very basic and fundemental terms such as 'religion.'<br>
<br>
Ok, now you own the common paradigm? You decide that one basic dictionary entry is sufficient definition for everything? Remind me to avoid any sort of meaningful technical discussion with on anything detail-based then. I cannot see how you can get down to brass tacks on any subject if that is the extent of your ability to define concepts.<br>
<br>
&gt;[Yes, mass chanting figures into most of these brainwashing memes. The important point is not in the individual action, but in the entire gestalt. Mass chanting is part only. And our mass chanting is so minimal as to be inconsequential. The difference here is in degree and amount. The Pledge is a very minor form of indoctrination. Orwell’s was modification of personality by bombardment of stimuli.]<br>
<br>
&gt;No this is one aspect of the indoctrinization - we get plenty more thats why its so alarming. This was the point, but in general you dont seem to disagree so I dont need to say much more about it.<br>
<br>
Please do. This has been the most intriguing portion of this post so far. You are positing that the indoctrination is alarming, please hold forth.<br>
<br>
And, before you read sarcasm into my tone that is not there, I mean that last line with all possible sincerity. I have two small children at home and indoctrination into society is of great importance to me. If you have some new take on it, I am all ears.<br>
<br>
&gt;Again I think you may or may not agree with the 9th circuit but this wasnt the point of my posts, I will continue to take issue with whatever aspects of whatever statements you or anyone make if I feel like taking the time to do it. Dont try to tell me I cant critisize your thought process if I dont feel like it - your in the wrong place for that.<br>
<br>
Nope, never told you that you couldn’t disagree. I just advised you to bring supports if you choose to do so.<br>
<br>
&gt;[Man, you might read, but you don’t comprehend. Just because I don’t agree with you ancillary points doesn’t mean we aren’t in line on the main issue. You don’t own the Truth all by your lonesome, bro. They say that reasonable people can disagree without becoming unreasonable, I am starting to wonder if the problem is more obvious when they agree.]<br>
<br>
&gt;Actually I read quite well in both english and german, and as far as comprehension goes, its quite clear from the fact that you lack basic understanding of some of the fundemental terms you use (again I think the term religion is a good example of this) makes it difficult to even agree to a basic framework with which to have a discussion. So be it.<br>
<br>
I care little that you are conversant in German, good for you. The fact that you can fail to see anyone else’s point in two languages doesn’t make it any better. You have consistently failed to even attempt to see my, or anyone else’s, point throughout much of this, preferring instead to rely on inexact definitions in populist, non-technical dictionaries and out of context quotes without even the barest nod for source or credit given.<br>
<br>
Fkin, you seem like, to an extent, your heart is in the right place. I don’t fault you for your views. I just think they’re poorly defined. I’ve been told “Bulvai, yer wrong, Nyer,” in about 15 different ways, and all too often without accompanying supports. The problem here is that you are very limited in a couple of important ways. Can you not see the worth in a precise definition for the purpose of discussion? Can you not see the worth in supporting a counter with reasons as to why you counter? Can you not see that perhaps, should someone’s understanding of something be different from your own, you might wish to attempt to comprehend what they are saying and why? Can you not see the worth in looking beyond your initial knee-jerk assumptions to the underlying issue? <br>

The above is a site that has information on the treaty on European Union - this unification has been going on for over 30 years now. I am sorry you (Bulvai) really dont know anything about it - comparing nafta to the EU which now has a common federal governance, a common currency and linked common policy simply flabergasts me - enjoy your reading.<br>

<br>
Rechecked, I cede the point. It's only what I deserve for skimming the paragraph while I was working and thus not paying sufficient attention.<br>
<br>
&gt;I can only assume you cannot read. The source was a /gov website - I thought I included the link but perhaps I did not.<br>
<br>
I read quite well - when I am not doing four other things at once. No link, and little enough info that it would require far too much effort on my part to look up a case that did not particularly fit your own guidelines. You mentioned, specifically, wealthy, powerful types. The information provided did not specify anything other than that those repped by public defenders got the shaft.<br>
<br>
&gt;Lastly, you claim I lack appreciation for precise definitions, yet it was *me* that went the the dictionary and got the actual definitions rather than you - repeadtedly - *and* your definitions did not match and in many cases seriously contravine these definitions <br>
<br>
My definitions do not match your single source definitions, yes. They were more specific, more precise, more to the point. The only thing they contravened were your attempts at obfuscation of your lack of direction.<br>
<br>
As to your EU comment, I have done plenty enough reading on it. I have yet to see that it is a single entity. They possess neither a common language, a common overall identity, or even common goals. There is little in common between the members of the EU aside from currency and a body that normalizes relations between them. While I did mention diversity as a sticking point in your poor comparisons, when taken as a whole, the EU is too far gone in the other direction. While we have a wildly diverse people, we still identify ourselves as Americans. Find me a person that Idientifies themselves as an EU'er, and I'll show you a mouthpiece for the EU. It is not a country.<br>
<br>
I do find it terribly interesting that you lose interest and flee at this juncture. Too many points to refute?  <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

Nafta - allows the free movement of goods and some services - and it sets up arbitration to resolve conflicts in these areas - and thats all.<br>

EU - Has a federal Government - The European Parliment. Has a common Currency the EU. Has freedom of movement (i.e. citizens can freely immigrate between member states). Has common policies via the European Parliment and measures of common defense (note that the newest treaty undergoing ratification at the moment makes common defense a much stronger institution), has free trade and movement of services, has a tax mechanism whereby member states contribute and capital is then used and redistributed by the European Federal Governement.<br>
<br>
 Though I dont expect you to understand at this point Bulvai, I will submit that not only has Europe been on the road to integration for over 30 years now, but it is now looking at expansion and further integration along multiple tracks. Nafta is Nafta, and to be honest doesnt really mean all that much when it is stacked on top of GATT and most favored status.

<br>
Hmm, this is a repeat? I’d actually have to say that the material has been referred to, but not covered. Don’t be so facetious as to assume that you posting a link is equal to you posting an explanation or argument.<br>
<br>
Single language? Did I say a single language? Why, no. I said a “common language”. The United States of America does not have a single language, but we do have a predominant “common language” in American. In EU offices, their EU code mandates that there will be at least one person available that is conversant in any language of any EU member you might choose to ask for. Should Slobodia (a name made up on the spot so as to not be insensitive and labeling towards small individual sub-entities within the EU) be a member of the EU and officially speak Slobodian, it matters little if there are only 500 people in the whole country. EU offices will have to have a Slobodian-conversant person available to each office. This is a logistics nightmare waiting to happen, but more to the point, it enforces lingual separatism instead of encouraging integration via an attempt to decide on a common tongue. <br>
<br>
A common tongue will not happen though, as the individual sub-entities (I still love that phrase) are very nationalistic and proud of their own languages. France actually has a ministry in its’ government dedicated to the preservation of the French language. They actively make up new terms for foreign slang that might invade France. Germany has a similar body. You claim to speak German, you should thereby know what they call such things as astronauts (cloud walkers or some-such, IIRC from what my limited knowledge of Deutsche produces). A ministry devoted to the preservation of one’s distinct nationalist language is fairly contrary to the aims of integration.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I am now labeled as having ADD. Is ADD a derogatory thing now too, Fkin? I am really starting to wonder why you decry me so much as being one who labels. I am fairly certain that a quick skimming of our posts would find more labels, being produced by you, in your posts. The irony is delicious, though I doubt you see it.<br>
<br>
&gt;Nafta - allows the free movement of goods and some services - and it sets up arbitration to resolve conflicts in these areas - and thats all.<br>
<br>
NAFTA (and last time I checked, common usage of acronyms pretty much says they should be entirely capitalized. I hate to give you grief on grammar, but after the whole precise definition argument, I feel obligated…) does all of these things, and promotes a closeness between Mexico and the USA in many ways, yup. Arbitration, hmm, that might be an important word. Commerce is movement of goods and service, financially. Could be an important word too.<br>
<br>
&gt;EU - Has a federal Government - The European Parliment. Has a common Currency the EU. Has freedom of movement (i.e. citizens can freely immigrate between member states). Has common policies via the European Parliment and measures of common defense (note that the newest treaty undergoing ratification at the moment makes common defense a much stronger institution), has free trade and movement of services, has a tax mechanism whereby member states contribute and capital is then used and redistributed by the European Federal Governement.<br>
<br>
Well, silly me, but I’ve yet to see the Queen of England step down because the EU is in place. I’ve yet to see the Chancellor of Germany wander off and play golf because the EU is on the job. In fact, has any individual sub-entity’s government packed it up? Why, no! Why is this? Because they retain sovereign status and self-government. <br>
<br>
I remember a long time ago when it was referred to as the EEC, or European Economic Community. This wasn’t an official name, just a proposed one. Near as I can tell, it’s a much more accurate one thoughl. The individual sub-entities (/snicker) of the EU have changed little, excepting the aspect of currency and such currency related issues as taxation. Common defense, for instance, has not been an issue for quite some time as most EU members were members, in good standing, of NATO or, alternatively, the Warsaw Pact. Now that WP has fallen, most of the previous WP members became NATO members. Heck, even Russia has a pseudo membership-in NATO.  As to the EU Parliament, I am waiting for the first decision that puts the EUP at odds with the sitting govt of a member nation. This will be the big litmus test. Will the EU stand or fall? Odds are that the first time this happens, it will be with some piddly little Slobodia-type individual sub-entity (LOL) that the world press will care little about. I doubt they’ll have the cojones to stand up to Germany, France, England, etc.<br>
<br>
Still, the point I am making is that the EU is primarily an economic concern. It provides financial services mostly. Common currency, taxations, arbitration (hey, there’s that word again) between members, and other such commerce-assistive tasks. It sounds more and more like NAFTA to me, though a bit more far reaching in the common currency bit. Still, Argentina uses US Dollars now, could Mexico be so far behind?<br>
<br>
&gt;Though I dont expect you to understand at this point Bulvai, I will submit that not only has Europe been on the road to integration for over 30 years now, but it is now looking at expansion and further integration along multiple tracks. Nafta is Nafta, and to be honest doesnt really mean all that much when it is stacked on top of GATT and most favored status. (I am going to assume this time you can actually look things up for yourself - here - big assumption given history.)<br>
<br>
Good for you. It is good to have opinions. Still, it is not so good to hold so tightly to those opinions that you cannot see the relative worth of others opinions. Yet, without close-minded people in the world, who would the open-minded ones have to compare ourselves to?<br>
<br>
Most Favored Nation trading status does not confer open border status. This is a logical end for NAFTA.<br>
<br>
Still, you are not paying attention. I said, “LOL, calling the EU a single nation would like calling the US and Mexico a single nation since NAFTA.” See the “LOL” in front of the line. Normal people with average levels of reading comprehension would see that the line following the “LOL” to be a jest. Perhaps they might more precisely term it hyperbole for humourous effect. Your reading comprehension did not notice this? Or was the following discourse too difficult for you to argue so you decided to attempt to, as my tanker buddies used to say, pop smoke and run? <br>
<br>
I compared, humourously, EU to the USA and Mexico post-NAFTA as a political comment, not a logical one. Why you cannot see this, or perhaps see it but not comprehend it, I do not know.  Someday, I hope that you too can learn to read just a little bit into what I, or anyone else, posts. The world will be that much the brighter for you.<br>
<br>
Oh, and the “on the road to integration for 30 years” thing is ludicrous. Those individual sub-entities (/chuckle) have been collectively invading and killing one another for thousands of years. 30 years doesn’t weigh much against history like that. You are obviously terribly impressed with EU. Good for you. I’ll be impressed in a few decades when they’ve faced challenges, should they survive them. Do you even know what was said about the USA during it’s infancy?<br>
<br>
&gt;If you cant see the differance between the EU and Nafta at this point please seek help.<br>
<br>
Why do I need to seek help? I have you! You are so helpful in providing so many unsupported arguments and unsourced and unexplained quotes (that you helpfully don’t even attempt to explain how they relate to your argument) that I doubt I’ll ever need professional help again.<br>
<br>
Now, are you ever going to respond to the refutation of your inane comments on Hinduism in the other thread, or perhaps the actual presentation of serious scholarly work is too much for you to handle? Was it too complex? Not pluralist enough? Perhaps you could tell me why your definition does not actually show that S&amp;M = religion, as I presented above? Why is it that when I get tired of playing with you and really dig hard that you suddenly evaporate and want to change the subject to something inane like EU vs NAFTA?<br>

<br>
Again - as previously stated - the EU nations have a common defence policy (something that is a currently sticky issue with some of the traditionally neutralist nations), they also have freedom of movement - if I live in Germany I can move to ireland and get a job because I am a citizen of Germany but I am also a citizen of the EU. This is something we do *not* have with Nafta and we are not likely to have - apparently your crystal ball is telling your its going to happen - much like it gave you some rather outlandish definitions for religion and other terms - but it has no bases is reality.<br>
<br>
Btw many states unofficially use the US dollar as currencey because they have such soft currencey - we can go into the relative merits of this if you want but its not what we are taling about.<br>

Much like the rest of what you have to say - you continue to contradict yourself. First you claim you like focused arguement - well this is focused.

<br>
Lastly let me get this straight - I am not respecting the opinions of others - this coming from the person who does not repect my opinions - and makes statements such as - Buddhism isnt a religion - because it doesnt fit your own personnal (made up on the spot I might add) definintion - right - I am supposed to take you seriously?

<br>
&gt;Again I am oh so amused that you make assertions without any actual quoting or citing of sources <br>
<br>
Well, heck, when I did quote sources you ran and hid from them. I figure if you aren't willing to respond to my sources, why put them in?<br>
<br>
&gt;forgive me if at this pointed I am somewhat jaded to your trolling <br>
<br>
Didn't someone else already chastise you for the &quot;troll&quot; comments? =)<br>
<br>
&gt;the EEC is an aspect of the EU - the EU has an executive branch, a legislative branch and a judical branch much like our federal government.<br>
<br>
When I mentioned the EEC term, I was discussing a bit of history of the EU. Why must you so frequently miss/ignore the point?<br>
<br>
&gt;In addition - our state entities have governors and their own executive and judicial branches - much like here (so your sarcastic comments about the queen and the chancellor of germany are about as relevent as your not so clever addition of a 4th point to the definition of plagerism) <br>
<br>
This is rich. You compare the Chancellor of Germany to the governor of, say, Nebraska? Germany is an independant cultural entity. It may be a member of the EU, but I doubt it will be equivalent to a state in terms of power and integration any time soon. You are naive if you think this to be true.<br>
<br>
&gt;legal cases can be appealled to the federal level of the EU if they are not resolved at the state level, and EU law superceeds state laws - but you knew all this because you have 'read a lot' about the subject right? <br>
<br>
Actually, yes, but those are theoretical assertions. I've still yet to hear about cases wherein an individual member government's decision was overturned by the EU. I want to see it happen. I want to see the EU tell Ireland what to do. It will be fun to watch.<br>
<br>
&gt;Again - as previously stated - the EU nations have a common defence policy (something that is a currently sticky issue with some of the traditionally neutralist nations), <br>
<br>
Most are members of NATO, as I've said. Yes, they may have gotten tacit agreements from traditionally neutral nations, but to tell me that the EU is responsible for England agreeing to defend France, for instance, is idiotic. Most of the countries within Europe have had various non-aggression and mutual-defence pacts going off and on for centuries. You should know this with your &quot;MA in History&quot;.<br>
<br>
&gt;they also have freedom of movement - if I live in Germany I can move to ireland and get a job because I am a citizen of Germany but I am also a citizen of the EU. This is something we do *not* have with Nafta and we are not likely to have<br>
<br>
Really? I know Mexicans that work here and Americans that work in Mexico. I know a helluva a lot of Canadians that work here and a lot of Americans that work in Canada. Are the US and Canada the same nation because of this?<br>
<br>
&gt;apparently your crystal ball is telling your its going to happen <br>
<br>
Nope, just telling me that I am not impressed until I see it get past challenge and strife. Anyone can perform an expermient, but no one can say for certain if it will work. Show me the EU working well in war time and I might be more impressed. Europe is experiencing relative peace right now, excluding some non-EU nations that cannot get things going. It's easy to build coalitions when things are quiet.<br>
<br>
&gt;much like it gave you some rather outlandish definitions for religion and other terms - but it has no bases is reality.<br>
<br>
Outlandish? Really? My definition was terribly simple. It was pretty much that a religion is a coherent belief system that includes a godhead as a significant figure in it precepts, and that definition was only to define the difference between a religion and a philosophy. This was the whole of the argument, in its' basic form. I've said this before and you've yet to provide any argument as to why my definition is outlandish, whereas I have most certainly shown, on multiple occassions, why your definition was specious.<br>
<br>
You may think that your definiton has a basis in reality, when all it has is a basis in &quot;Lowest Common Denominator&quot; Pluralism.<br>
<br>
I guess I'll wait and see if you miss that point again.<br>
<br>
&gt;Btw many states unofficially use the US dollar as currencey because they have such soft currencey - we can go into the relative merits of this if you want but its not what we are taling about.<br>
<br>
Hmm, if common currency, in my example, has no positive effect on the argument, why are you still trumpeting it in yours? This whole EU line of discourse has no merit in the overall discussion. It is simply you steering the argument away from areas where you are failing to make your point.<br>
<br>
The way I see it, you are not arguing to make a point now. You are merely arguing to win. This is why you have gone so far afield. The tactic that I am seeing is that, if you keep switching topics, you ight just accidently find one that you can triumph with.<br>
<br>
&gt;Much like the rest of what you have to say - you continue to contradict yourself. First you claim you like focused arguement - well this is focused.<br>
<br>
You have gotten focused, good on ya! Too bad you finally got focused on somethin waaaay off topic. Insofar as your ridiculous assertion that I am contradicting myself, have I complained about your sudden focus, aside from wondering why your are suddenly focused off topic? No, I've argued right along with your pointless obfuscation.<br>
<br>
I understand that you are desperate to see me contradict myself, but you might try being a bit more objective. Just because you want something so very hard, doesn't mean that it will come true.<br>
<br>
&gt;Second you *asked* to talk about an example of another nation that was not only similar in size to the US (ignoring the meaning and use of statistics a topic you clearly dont understand), but now after disputing the facts at hand you no longer wish to pursue the issue. I wonder why.<br>
<br>
I asked to have a valid comparison, not to switch the entire argument to a discussion on what the EU is or is not, and certainly not have an entire discussion based on a flippant hyperbole on my part. Show some discretion, Fkin.<br>
<br>
&gt;Perhaps you should try reading before replying because your ignorance and arrogance at this point are nothing short of stunning.<br>

My supposed ignorance is no more stunning than your blatant refusal to attempt to comprehend what someone has written. So, in response, perhaps you should try comprehending something after you read it, then respond to it.<br>

I was going to go on but I dont see the point - here is a link for you if you prefer to actually read up on the subject from an offical German Source. Here is the title<br>

<br>
That is one heckuva long, run-on sentence. Whew. So you admit to not even attempting to read, comprehend, or otherwise view anyone else's ideas? I suspected as much.<br>
<br>
Advice from Fkin's Big Book of Winning Arguments # 139: Be selective about what you respond to. You look smarter that way - oh, and use a hyphen to connect thoughts.<br>
<br>
&gt;Its also amusing that you finish your post saying your not going to reply to my points after complaining that I dont address yours - I knew you already self contradict a lot but I didnt really think you were such a hypocrite.<br>
<br>
You really don't read anything, do you? I ended my post with, &quot;Oh, and don't accuse me of being arrogant unless you intend me to laugh at the utter hypocrisy of the statement =)&quot;. That has nothing whatsoever to do with not replying to your posts. You have some sort of imaginary argument going on in your head, similar to ours, don't you? Is this where these lines come from, because I sure can't find some of these things you keep saying that I said....<br>
<br>
&gt;I will only say again that Germany is *not* an independant entity - its part of the EU, by treaty - whats your next assertion? That the earth is flat or that Aliens are amoung us? Are you writing an X-Files episode perchance? Gravity does exist where you come from right? <br>
<br>
I will thus say again, weren't you the one that said repition won't make your argument stronger? <br>
<br>
And to be precise, something you apparently aren't good at, I said &quot;Germany is an independant cultural entity&quot;. I know that you're not good at comprehension, but even a chimpanzee can press the &quot;Page Up&quot; key and see what I said. If you cannot see the difference, I cannot make it clear to you.<br>
<br>
&gt;Ok, since you cant check for yourself and you obviously didnt click the link I provided for you - I will paste in a few sections from it here for you. (by the way I lived in Ireland [another member of this EU thing] for 6 years and my wife is German, when I told her that Germany was an independant entity she said she wished it was [she is a Euro-Sceptic if you know what that is]).<br>
<br>
How good for you! First you say that you lived in Japan for a few years, now Ireland (a country that did not, by referendum, vote to join the EU and was essentially forced to). You are a regular world traveller. They travel broadens the mind. Didn't work for you, so much the shame.<br>
<br>
To counter your &quot;BTW&quot; up there, I spent 7 years in Germany, lived abroad in Italy and England for short periods, my Grandmother is Japanese, my best friend is a Cuban, and I too can come up with pointless non-related globalist shite  to make myself look worldly.<br>
<br>
&lt;snip yet another representation of the same old links, yay&gt;<br>
&gt;Note that the EU has a common currencey and bank and every other aparatus the US Federal Government has - *totally* unlike nafta - but you know all this already right Bulvai? After all you have read a lot about it. No wait sorry I forgot you do know your just Trolling - silly me.<br>
<br>
Yet again you think that this is an issue. What part of this is confusing you. I make a flippant reference and you decide to change the suject entirely. I will again call you unfocused, not because you cannot maintain focus on anything, but because you fail to maintain focus on the important portion of the argument.<br>
<br>
Oh, and keep calling me a Troll, Fkin, you really are looking more and more mature each time.<br>
<br>
As to your link here, sending me to a website that describes the structure of the EU in its' own words is a bit silly for you. After all, you were the one who was decrying the US for not standing up to its' own ad copy in the Pledge, now you send people to the EU's ad copy in the big Treaty here and expect people to believe it whole cloth? This is primo inconsistency here. <br>
<br>
The best part is looking at the ad copy in the big Treaty and then following it up with the link to the speech later on. I'll get into that more later =)<br>
<br>
&lt;snip link to speech&gt;<br>
<br>
Right, the speech talks about the need to transform from a Confederacy to a Federation, did you catch the implicit meaning behind that? The EU is a Confederation, period. Do you understand what a Confederation is? How about a Federation? Do you understand that we have a Federal government whereas they has a confederation of nations? Can you comprehend the difference?<br>
<br>
Some nice quotes from the speech, in an area where the speaker is discussing problems facing the EU, &quot;[sic] the problems and challenges facing Europe have wound themselves into a knot that will be very hard to undo in the current framework:&quot; &lt;snip whinges about currency problems, EU Commision scandals, and overly aggressive expansion&gt; &quot;the poor acceptance of the EU Parliament and low turn-outs for European elections&quot;. Man, sounds like he is saying that the European people just aren't all fired up and rowdy about the EU. Can't blame em. I'd be pretty ticked off if someone told me that I was no longer an American and was not a Western Hemispheric Unionist along with our Canadian, Mexican, and South American sub-entity friends.<br>
<br>
Other areas talk about how the EU Parliament needs to have real power to survive. Wait! Could that mean that, much like I've said previously, the EU Parliament is not the powerhouse you make it out to be?<br>
<br>
Another quote from the speech (and thanks for providing me with so much good support for my argument): &quot;Of course this simple solution (Roy Note: total Federation of EU) is immediately criticized as being unworkable. Europe is not a new continent (Roy note: Didn't I say this?), so the criticism goes, but full of different peoples, cultures, languages and histories (Roy note: I'm pretty sure that I said that) The nation-states are realities that simply cannot be erased, and more globalization and Europeanization create superstructures and anonymous actors remote from the citizens, the more people will cling to the nation-states that give them comfort and security,&quot;. The speaker then imeediately follows this with, &quot;Now I sahre these objections, because they are correct.&quot;<br>
<br>
Damn, your own source agrees more with what I've said so far than with you. Unlike you though, the speaker does advance some alternatives to the problems at hand. This is a good thing. Still, everything that the speech identified as a currently existing problem was present in my litany of concerns about the EU. You sought to refute what I was saying as incorrect, and then one of your own sources shows the EU to be as ineffectual and strife-ridden as I hypothesized it would be.<br>
<br>
The irony, again, is beautiful.<br>
<br>
Perhaps this may convince you that simply providing a source sans good explanation is a bad idea, and not equivalent to offering supports for your points. Then again, perhaps I am naive to hope that you will learn anything.<br>
<br>
Seeing as how you aren't doing to well again, how about we switch the argument back to something a little more on topic, seeing as how you have about the same ability to seperate culture from nation state as you do faith from the trappings of religion. I think I've done enough to counter and argue you EU thread, how about we revisit religion and the the Pledge and move back closer to topic? You certainly left that thread pretty quickly once you ran out of ploys. <br>
<br>
So, do you have any counters to the primary argument, or do you cede that I am correct? <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

Fkin? You out there? Why are you posting if you stopped reading? Buzz off, lil fly. If you won't argue like a sentient being, cede and leave. Yet again, you tell me that I am wrong and refuse to explain why. Do you have a writ from the Pope proclaiming you to be &quot;Eternally Correct and thus Exempt from Mortal Concerns with Logical Proof&quot;?<br>
<br>
&gt;No I admitted giving up reading yours after your stopped reading mine, there is a differance, even though you dont understand what it is. Hell you blatantly addmitted you were only skimming posts at least once before, and on several occasions you clearly lost your train of thought in your own writing.<br>
<br>
Yup, skimmed one portion of one post, and I admitted it rather abashedly. That you decide to take my honesty as something to feel superior about is amusing. I would say that it indicates that your ego is feeling abused by yours truly and you are desperately clinging to anything that might make you feel right.<br>
<br>
Hell, I've showed time and again that I read your posts more closely than you read mine. At least I try to understand them and divine your unclear points. You won't even go that far.<br>
<br>
&gt;Since we cant even agree about fundemental terms, and since you feel free to ignore anything that doesnt suit your particular point of view, even if it is a totally legitimate source, why have a conversiation at all? <br>
<br>
How am I ignoring your source, BTW? I quoted from it. And we can agree on terms, you just refuse any agreement unless it is your term. I've discussed your terms, shot em full of holes too. You refuse to even contemplate mine. Weak.<br>
<br>
&gt;Yep I have been to Japanm and Korea, and I lived in Ireland from 1993-1999 (not quite the six years it appears to be). Much like the rest of what you write your snide remark adds nothing in particular to the discussion at hand. Hence I once again dub thee - Mr Troll - grats.<br>
<br>
Let me point out that you trumpeted your own pointless world travel stories far before me. Get over yourself. And you are up to blatant name-calling now. Whee, we're back in the second grade and Fkin is resorting to name-calling because he is getting picked on by that evil bully, Bulvai.<br>
<br>
Oh, and thanks for finally showing respect and capitalizing Japan (and Korea and Ireland too). I appreciate, bro =)<br>
<br>
&gt;Lastly your entire discussion of the one source I provided only refutes your own rather atroucious point - nafta is nothing like the EU. Congratulations your finally getting it.<br>
<br>
To that I say this, if you are so damned right, grow a pair and argue point by point. At least support your refutations with some basic logic. Weak, weak, weak!<br>
<br>
C'mon Fkin, show me the logic. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>
