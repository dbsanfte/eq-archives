<br>
We killed the real (not nerfed) AoW with 45.  If you ever brought near 40 to a mob and we ran you over, you haven't mentioned it yet.<br>
<br>
When we went to basement, you were claiming with 18+ a few recruits.  Not 20 recruits or 30... not even 10 unless they were hiding or you tried counting the group that was killing under the ramp.<br>
<br>
You didn't just leave HP either, GM was involved. <br>
<br>
I remember clearly Salta insulting us and making comments when LC tried to run us out of basement with 35-40 people.   That's tagged ppl in-zone before they were... not 18 people with 30 &quot;going to log in soon&quot; or &quot;will be here later&quot; as we were being told in the basement.  So don't play that it's a wraith game.  Oh and same in Ntov... but of course it's only a bad thing and worthy of flames when we do it.   Of COURSE nobody EVER did that in old Vis.. that would be... completely hypocrical of Woow!  Woow is not a hypocrite, Vis never ever did anything of the sort, right?<br>
<br>
<br>
It's the same old story when old wraith caught up to vis, when LC caught up to vis, when we caught up to LC... it's the same scenarios over and over.. the new guy comes in with some folks and the old guard doesn't deem them &quot;worthy&quot; with what they have and tell them to leave.  Everybody with significant server kills have been involved in this same setup.<br>
<br>
Old Wraith and Old Vis fought each other till wraith disbanded and Vis nearly fell apart. It sucked.<br>
<br>
LC/Vis had their spat and started sharing.  Seemed to work good for them.<br>
<br>
We had our spat with LC and we started sharing.  Worked great for us, and with a few exceptions seems to make LC and Vis happy also.  <br>
<br>
Now Explicit is having their spat.   I am not top dog in Wraith, and I certainly wont' speak for LC and Vis.. but IMO it would be silly to not offer you guys a spot at the table.  You guys kill the majority of what we kill, and are getting better.  Everything esle is he said/she said bullshit.  <br>
<br>
Is the last few days how you *want* to play, or do you want to stop this crap?<br>

First thanks for apologizing to block the door in ogre form, it was unnecessary. Otherwise we didnt train each other when we both ran in initially, we just didn't deal with the traps properly and people died to the dots.<br>
<br>
Now I had no problems with Explicit running past us. We've competed before and the status quo has been to get ready and engage first. I'd like us to not be this confrontational but it hasn't come to be yet. We managed to get ready first and engaged like you said. The part you are wrong at is &quot;while we waited and watched&quot;. I'm sorry you are wrong and I can dig out logs and possibly screenshots showing soullance and few others running around in the room. We were fine till the mob reached 80 at which point the other golems in the room were trained. Although it is possible that someone in my raid messed up and agro'ed them but given the fact Explicit had ppl running around in the room, when they had no business being there, leads me to believe that either intentionally OR accidentally it was a explicit members.<br>
<br>
To all the Desi-haters in the room, Wassaaaaaap !!<br>
