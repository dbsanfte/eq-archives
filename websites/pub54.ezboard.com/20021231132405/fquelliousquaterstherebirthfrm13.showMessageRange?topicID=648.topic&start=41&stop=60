tactics suck, too many to remember and things like lag or missed nukes result in dead wizard.<br>

Much easier to just click a button and have competitions to see whos manaburn is the biggest.<br>

<br>
Well Esm... I look at it this way...<br>
<br>
First off, I state again, when someone busts their arse to do something that few (maybe none) others have done before, why not tell everyone about it?  And if it has the additional benefit of snubbing someone who's main claim to fame was clicking an MB hotkey, all the better.<br>
<br>
Seph killed Wooshi with 3 people and bragged about it.  What have you done?  Answer: Nada (of course, if I'm wrong in this assumption, maybe you can entertain us all with one of your exploits of greatness)<br>
<br>
Maybe... if you tried levelling, and tried getting gear, and honed your skills... maybe you too could do something like that.<br>
<br>
Until that time, oh well.  Currently, we have Seph... whos words are of his actions... and we have Esm... whos well... just a lotta words.<br>
<br>
People who accomplish things, have every right (imo) to brag.  And the funny thing is that in the majority of cases the folks that whine about it are those who could never accomplish the same thing.<br>
<br>
As many well know, Montyy has been very vocal in his opinions on burn squads and AE groups.  Here's my opinion.<br>
<br>
I hate them.  Period.  You wanna know why?  Cause it takes no skill at all.  I love the xp, and I love the loot... but I hate the fact that they promote a breed of wizards that suck at a class that I am devoted to.  <br>
<br>
Sorry.... but AE = pull a train, have 3 chanters chain AE stun, have the wizzies AE nuke, pray that the chanters dont get stunned, and rince/repeat.<br>
<br>
Burn squads = pull a mob and have a bunch of wizzies click their burn hotkeys.<br>
<br>
This brings up my wizzie rant.  The majority of these new wizzies make me absolutely sick... in that they did nothing but ae, and dont know their class.  If they cant chain nuke, they sit there with their mouths open collecting flies like an inbred on the porch of a doublewide trailer.  These wizards remind me of monks that didnt know how to Feign way back in Lake of Ill Omen.<br>
<br>
We all know them, and have grouped/raided with them.  They're the ones that have the huge crits, and we always wind up seeing their names cause they're getting summoned, slaughtered, and then whining that the warriors cant hold aggro.<br>
<br>
And then... there are the truly great wizzies.  Personally, I consider myself a fantastic wizard.  I can nuke with the best of them, and I can fill in wherever necessary.  And best of all, I pay attention and learn.  In that, I've been blessed in learning from some damn fine wizards.  Two that come to mind are Crysalis and Kalani.  I remember watching Crysalis in Fear, kiting the entire Temple while we picked off mobs.  He kept us alive, and didnt nuke once.  And Kalani... well... she's the invisible wizzie in that she does it all, and does it so damn well that you never even notice her (isnt flamboyant and doesnt get aggro).<br>
<br>
This past weekend, I was in Fear helping a fellow wizzie get his Golem drop.  This time, it was my turn to kite the temple (along with a 3 other wizzies).  On Sunday, we had no puller, and no chanter.  I did both.  I pulled, and I did crowd control as well.  I abandoned the nukes to fill a needed role.  I pushed the limits of my class, and because of it, we succeeded.<br>
<br>
Am I bragging?  Yep. I've been playing wizzie chanter since my days in CoM and Karnors, and I pull whenever I can.  I work hard to add new dimensions to my abilities, and to be a good example of what wizzies can do if they actually get their collective heads outta their asses and actually try.<br>
<br>
And to Gea... you're right.  It (post-nerf burns) has been done on other servers.  But why not on Quel?  Why is it that, now that it's no longer easy, wizzies arent still burning dragons?<br>
<br>
Answer: Cause the majority of wizzies dont have the skill that it takes to pull it off... to plan and execute such a kill.  And they hide behind excuses rather than facing the truth that they simply dont have the talent, drive, or dedication needed to do it.<br>
<br>
And then when someone like Seph comes out and say &quot;look what I did&quot;, well... people get jealous.<br>
<br>
You should be.  People may have their opinions of Seph, and most of them seem to be somewhat negative... but I find it very difficult to find a more dedicated or talented player on the server.<br>
<br>
And FK, if you ever do decide to try a conventional burn, feel free to look me up.  I'll be more than happy to try something that requires more skill than luck. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

How do you come to think that I want &quot;we&quot; to compare Seph and myself in deeds or words? Kudos for killing a dragon with three, although I think that's still wrong on VI's part, and Seph is no more at fault for it than FK was for burning dragons and utilizing the tools VI allots to each class. Too bad he came off like a pissant in the bragging process. No insight into his character, determination, or talent can undo the pissing match he wants with this thread. That lazy wizard, whose only claim to &quot;talent&quot; is pressing a button in the minds of some, has enough class to ignore him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>People who accomplish things, have every right (imo) to brag.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Show me a bragging thread in the General forum where Wraith/Exp/LC/insert-some-guild/individual was crass enough to highlight their accomplishments at the expense of someone else. This isn't a simple bragging thread. If it was, I wouldn't have replied at all. If it was, you wouldn't feel the need to make it into something greater than it is. You need look no further than the title and one liners, unless you think it's perfectly coming of someone to cut another down for initially disagreeing with them in a cordial fashion before it went downhill with Montyy insisting FK was strictly a farmer among other things? If that's the case, you're a little pissant too.<br>
<br>
I know it's difficult when it comes to people you know, but make an *attempt* to be objective (expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations), and look at the bad of his posts here, not just the good. With any luck you'll realize that my gripe has nothing to do with limelight-envy. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=esmalyn>Esmalyn</A> at: 11/11/02 9:58:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wulfgyrdracokyn>Wulfgyr Dracokyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.psynical.com/17anidot1b.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Milk sucks... got beer?</span><br>  Posts: 210<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/11/02 10:00:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=45>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.psynical.com/WulfyFace.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FLAME ME BIATCH~ (faithkillz)</span><hr size=1> Hehe, it sure was, Slas.<br>

I wouldnt say that.. Though that is partially true.. Most wizards are very busy with raiding and PoP.  Luclin was old and done by the time manaburn teams were dominating the content.  If PoP had come before the nerfs.. Manaburn kills would have been way down.  Wizards are just busy now and don't have the time to organize a nuke raid. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Seph is not a friend of mine.  Not to say that I dislike him, it's more that we dont run in the same circles.  So to say that I'm being less than objective is incorrect.  Also, I'm a MB wizzie (though I got MB a day before the nerf), and I use it regularly.<br>
<br>
Seph is one of those people that I respect for his talent and gaming ability... and that's what he proved by killing Wooshi.<br>
<br>

<br>
Fault?  There's no fault here.  Seph fought the good fight against a mob that was fully capable of defending itself.  Burners didnt.  Burners either burned or were burned.  There was never any skill.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>when I said gloat I was referring at Seph's laugh at FK for no longer being able to do what s/he liked to do, burn dragons<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Actually, I think the end of that quote would be better served as &quot;has enough brains to not reply to a thread that he can't possible prevail in cause he isnt (and never will be) in Seph's league in terms of gaming skill&quot;.<br>
<br>
Fk and Montyy can (and have) gone round and round with respect to morality... and since it's all about opinions... neither backed down, and the best they could ever hope for was to agree to disagree.  <br>
<br>
Yet Seph called FK out in the one way that was perfect.  He showed everyone on these boards that he is a superior player, and one that isnt defined by a MB hotkey.<br>
<br>
Notice we havent seen the usual meaningless spam of FK quotes?  Why is that?  Maybe it's cause there's not a thing he could say to compare himself to Seph as a player.<br>
<br>
This isnt an agree to disagree issue.  Seph is &quot;Sephrok The Pathfinder&quot;, which means that (if nothing else) he was the best PvP Ranger on our server.  FK is what?<br>
<br>
Yeah, Seph came off as being a wee bit childish in terms of his attack on FK... but you obvious arent seeing the big picture.  Seph is a guildleader... and one that takes care of his people.  He watched Montyy and FK argue, and saw that it went nowhere.  And what did he do?  He did the one thing that Montyy wasnt able to.<br>
<br>
One post that shut FK up.<br>
<br>
Oh... btw... just in case you've forgotten, this is the flame board.  If this was a simple gloat post, it would have gone in General.  And yer right... it's not about Wooshi.  It's about Seph sticking his nose up at FK and saying &quot;I'm better than you are, and I can prove it&quot;.<br>
<br>
And Zeik... yer absolutely right.  With the wizzies, it was all about the loot.  Kinda funny how it is when the loot potential (the same loot that all the wizzies posted claims that they werent after) dropped, the burn raids stopped... completely.  If it was about the thrill of the battle, or the skill involved in the kill, why havent they had a single kill on Quel since the nerf.<br>
<br>
Hmmmmm...<br>
<br>
And finally, Gae... while I agree with you that the PoP content is taking up the time of a lot of wizzies, I still ask why they havent taken the time to prove everyone wrong and show that they can trake out a dragon without MB.  Maybe it's just me being a prideful little shit... but if I was in FK's shoes, I'd sure as hell be out there planning a wizzie raid to prove people wrong... and show them that I could still do dragons without MB.  Someone will prolly post a rebuttal along the lines of &quot;well maybe FK doesnt think he has anything to prove?&quot;<br>
<br>
And yet FK has time to post endless strings of quotes to argue?  <br>
<br>
Actions not words.  Seph's actions spoke volumes.  What about FK?  When are we gonna see FK stand forward and kill another dragon... esp now that they're all up again since the wizzies cant seem to burn them? <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><br>

Yes and no.. It was more of a &quot;good loot for little time invested&quot; deal.  The chance at a scale or a spell or a haste belt for 30 minutes invested was a good deal for many wizards.  It wasn't just about the loot it was about fast loot.<br>
Though it wasn't the same for all wizards and despite what FK has said on this board she is unfairly targeted because she wasn't the greedy person that this board lies to portray wizards who burned dragons as.  I still don't see her running around dripping in riches do you?<br>
<br>

<br>
Seph and I have had our differences, a loooong time ago. Since then, and before then really, I've been nothing but impressed with his ability. I may not like how he handles some interpersonal conflict, but I do like how he handles being a ranger. I've watched Seph stay alive in situations that cause 99% of the rangers on this server to fold up and whimper.<br>
<br>
Neither grouped nor raided with FK or Esmalyn. Both obviously have the intellect necessary to be competent at what they choose to do in EQ. No idea what their skils or accomplishments are.<br>
<br>
The point to this, you ask? No reason to impugn anyone's ability. If you want to impugn their choices or their comments, cool, but you will likely lose if you choose to present a competent player as an incompetent one.<br>
<br>
Random comment on Kalani: Kalani isn't even there when you group with her. She's above it all. The only time you notice her is when she drops that 3k crit on some mob to hammer it dead when it is at a 1/4 bub of life, or when the evac goes off just as the tank calls for it. She's easily the best wizard I've ever had the pleasure to group with. I cannot recall a time in the past year when I've had to heal her in normal combat. <p>a_Bearhat01<br>

<br>
He did not push any envelope.  He made use of advantages available now that were not available when Wuoshi was actually a possible threat, from AA abilities, greater levels, spells, and equipment attained in a stage of this game only long after the aforementioned dragon has become a trivialized encounter.<br>
<br>
If mobs were always meant to fight back then explain abilities like Assassinate, Headshot, Ashen Hand, Disintegrate, and Banish.  Instant death at the single push of a button by a sole individual.  Manaburning a dragon, whether you liked it or not, required some degree of timing with others.<br>
<br>
Quasqueton states:  &quot;I hate them. Period. You wanna know why? Cause it takes no skill at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
In reference to AE groups...<br>
As distasteful as I found the obnoxious AE groups that were in Fungus Grove, Sebilis, and Howling Stones etc. if you have ever done the Ring of Fire event in Acrylia Caverns (especially when Luclin first came out.) you'd know this isn't true.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why is it that, now that it's no longer easy, wizzies arent still burning dragons?&quot;<br>
<br>
Probably because, like me, they're sick of being stereotyped and told by others how they should and should not play their class and what they can and cannot do.  (Like you're doing to Faithkilz.  Have you actually grouped with her though?  I have and I know she isn't the overburning incompetent you keep insinuating she is.  She is a very good player.)  Or maybe they got sick of hearing the whining from people jealous because they can't 'insta-kill' a dragon.  Jealousy masked behind accusations of farming or some oblique long winded explanation to support the stale concept that no single class should be able to kill anything without a warrior to tank and a cleric to heal.  Whining that will resume the moment a handful of wizards did kill a dragon once again.  <br>
<br>
&quot;if I was in FK's shoes, I'd sure as hell be out there planning a wizzie raid to prove people wrong.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is a very transparent attempt to bait her to open herself up to you and your friends' continual ridicule, nothing more. (Because you know as well as I do the first thing out of people like Montyy's and Sephrok's mouth will be precisely comments to that effect.)   She doesn't have to prove anyone wrong.  You've already been proven wrong on the count that a group consisting solely of wizards can't kill a dragon without solely using manaburn.  Anything else she could do is simply redundant and lowering herself down to your level with a bunch of childish brats. <br>
<br>
&quot;Seph is &quot;Sephrok The Pathfinder&quot;, which means that (if nothing else) he was the best PvP Ranger on our server.&quot;<br>
<br>
So he surivived a free-for-all in the Arena against other rangers?  Big deal.  Draugrim's title is Champion of War and he survived a free-for-all in the Arena against all other melee class types, so if PvP is your sole assessment of a player's skill and since Draugrim was also on our server's team that won the Test of Tactics, that would make him the best PvP ranger on our server, not Sephrok by any stretch.  PvP skill has little to do with your ability to play a class in the so-called high end game or how well you work with others.  (Side observation here, why doesn't anyone from the Zek servers ever win the finals of these myriad PvP contests or ever get the game firsts of killing Brand X mob?)<br>
<br>
&quot;esp now that they're all up again since the wizzies cant seem to burn them?&quot;<br>
<br>
Funny you should mention that.  I guess that proves wizards weren't &quot;stealing content&quot; from mid level guilds after all.  If all those poor powerless mid level guilds were being &quot;cheated&quot; out of their shot at Kunark dragons, why ARE they still up for days at a time.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;People may have their opinions of Seph, and most of them seem to be somewhat negative... but I find it very difficult to find a more dedicated or talented player on the server.&quot;<br>
<br>
You wonder why?  Respect, like trust, is an earned commodity.  I don't respect players for their equipment or corpse count as it doesn't prove what kind of person they are or if they're a skilled player or not.  Only those who display a level of maturity and regard for others are entitled to my respect.  Sephrok revels in the fact that he is immature and has no respect for others and thus is undeserving of my respect.  <br>
<br>
You may find it difficult to find a better player on this server but then the best players don't need constant accolades for their accomplishments or go out of their way to belittle others publicly at every turn.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Lauriston states:  &quot;Archery is going to be nerfed pretty soon (according to Scott Hartsman, anyway)... so this is another one of those &quot;enjoy it while you can&quot; situations.&quot;<br>
<br>
From Absor on the Ranger's Glade.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever we do with archery, if anything, in the end we’ll make sure it’s balanced and works for gameplay in EverQuest. Please don’t get all riled up over an interpretation of something heard at Fan Faire, especially since the main point Scott was trying to make was that there are other things more important to look at about archery than an auto-attack feature.&quot;<br>
<br>
The &quot;nerf interpretation&quot; was taken when some ranger players asked about making an auto-attack feature for archery and the response was that there were more important issues to look at first involving archery than auto-attack, notably line of sight issues.  It was then snatched up and declared an upcoming nerf to rangers by some hopeful monks bitter about their recent nerf and the announcement that development team is still looking at another mitigation adjustment to monks since they are tanking better than chain classes, which they don't want.  <br>
<br>
If they do anything they're going to end up having to refund over 48 AA points points to rangers who bought AM3, EQ, the Combat Fury ranks, Fury of the Ages, and Dexterity.  That will be interesting to say the least.<br>

<br>
I remember part of your argument was MB teams took content away from mid tier guilds. Neither can I forget you resorting to call FK a farmer in that long ass thread after s/he dared you to find one instance where s/he did something other than give the loot s/he won to guild mates who could use it. Does that make Gaethan a farmer, a content thief, for giving you the scale off one of those burns? Does that make Gaethan an accomplice and you an accessory for playing a small role in the heinous act of stealing the same content you felt needed so much protection, that you had to question FK’s true intentions and scoff at his/her charity, only to turn around and benefit from it yourself?<br>
<br>

<br>
You should have stopped at “There’s no fault here.” It’s amusing how you fall back on Seph’s talents, which I don’t question, never knowing or caring about them, never being the focus of my posts. Does the analogy that it takes a measure of skill for an MB team to survive a burn elude you, or do you ignore it to raise the gap between Sephrok’s skill and the burners’? There was never any skill involved in a burn? That’s a difference between you, Seph, and myself. I don’t have a talent scale to weigh my bias on, base talent with a single tactic (pre-nerf MB) on which to decide if someone makes the grade or fails. I may not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>like</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> them for doing it, but I have to concede that right and wrong in this gray area is more akin to a personal preference based on my experiences and prejudices, not a truth for all. I’m not prick enough to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>continue</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to flame FK and burners for playing the game contrary to what I think is challenging or meets my skill standards after the nerf, either. I blame Verant for not bothering to address the sickening ease with which Luclin/PoP players can wipe mid level content out for newer players and catering to small server percentages to boot.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Actually, I think the end of that quote would be better served as &quot;has enough brains to not reply to a thread that he can't possible prevail in cause he isnt (and never will be) in Seph's league in terms of gaming skill&quot;.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You’re right. Sephrok’s sophistication and execution are right up there with his game skills. It’s enough to make anyone duck tail and run. /whistle<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Fk and Montyy can (and have) gone round and round with respect to morality... and since it's all about opinions... neither backed down, and the best they could ever hope for was to agree to disagree.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
As far as I’m concerned Montyy’s morality within the game can be cheaply bought with convenience. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Yeah, Seph came off as being a wee bit childish in terms of his attack on FK... but you obvious arent seeing the big picture. Seph is a guildleader... and one that takes care of his people.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
I apologize if you thought different of me Quas, but when it comes to the boards and the game I won't make exception for someone based on rank or guild, even if they lead it well. Whatever shining examples may stick out in your mind about Sephrok, they do not shield him from making a complete moron of himself in the present and overshadow his accomplishment in the process. That’s the angle you don’t want to see, and the one I can’t avoid because it’s glaring right in the title. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>It's about Seph sticking his nose up at FK and saying &quot;I'm better than you are, and I can prove it.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
Yes, I'm quite aware of what they were.  Randomly throwing people to compete against each other with the only regulation on equipment is &quot;no artifacts and no right click items&quot; then disallowing the use of standard class specific abilities like Hide or kiting, is a free-for-all against anyone who doesn't have some of the best armor and weapons available.  So save your breath on trying to validate the merits of PvP skills and their overall relevance in EverQuest, better people than you have tried and failed.<br>
