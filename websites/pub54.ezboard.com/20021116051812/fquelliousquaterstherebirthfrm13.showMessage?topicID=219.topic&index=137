<br>
You believe it is acceptable to publicly trash the reputation of VM &quot;for fun.&quot;  Perhaps you think this is acceptable in this day and age because we're often considered the bad guy.<br>
<br>
We are a raiding guild and for the most part have no contact with 80-90% of the server population.  The days you speak of in your original post have came and went and are dead.  You are the reason we are still considered the bad guy.  You are one of many who keep the stereotype alive by telling these asinine stories that have no plausibility in the here and now.  That 80-90% rarely get a chance to judge us for themselves because of our lack of contact but they are taught to think we are evil by word of mouth.<br>
<br>
I am posting because I do care, unlike so many before me.  If you had a real problem with VM you would take it up with us.  No, you don't have a real problem with VM.  Yes, you are trying to amuse yourself and trying to pull a few strings, replying in your debate-like manner to try to find any snippet of fault in anyone who opposes you.  Your ego is larger than the false VM you are trying to desecrate.  I do not believe you are jealous.  I believe you are trying to gain some sort of popularity by bashing the guild who is popular to bash.  It is a tired routine and I believe you know it.<br>
<br>
This post isn't specifically for Stylee, rather its for everyone who has misconceptions about VM in the here and now.  Maybe its time to rethink the foundations of your hatred and take account of your own virtues.<br>

Vis hasnt always been perfect but we try very hard to be fair.  Its not hard pleasing everyone and doing the best for yourself.  We never would intention hurt someone.  The wyvren incodent is just silly.  We got all these accusations thrown at us right off the bat too.  Personaly I dont want to help someone thats being rude especially when no one felt it was our fault.  We never put the wyvren outside HoT it always goes in a unoccupied alcove.  Mistakes happen and a lot overreacted and accused.  =/  And we did consider going out of our way to go back and go out of our way to move it but you were just so rude we didnt.  Can you blame us?<br>

And like this one day i was in seb, and i asked this guyz if my friends sisters twink could group with him and he said no. W T F?? i meen O M G HOW RUDE!<br>
<br>
And so like this one time this guy in  ViS Moiarr! He was training, and i had shout turned off!! and the little gerk didnt even have the NERVE to say train in ooc! i meen come on! Like its my responsibility to turn on shout just for him!. Hes such a jerk all he does is train all day i just know it, i bet you if i played for more then 1.5 hours a day i could see him training<br>
<br>
and like W   T   F   there was this mob some idiot trained us but like i know it was this Vis Maeorr guy, like i never seen him but im so sure!!!!!! IT WAS HIM OMG!!!!~~~<br>
<br>
SO like and umm... This one time i sent him a tell calling him a (*&amp;*(&amp; then said i did his mom in a *(&amp;#$ like manner, and he has the nerve to get mad at me? COME ON FOLKS! Cant you see?<br>
<br>
And like he his this weapon, like WTF? just becuase he has this weapon he thinks hes the best of all servers! well inever actually asked him what he thought of himself BUT IM SURE he thinks highly of his self hes so conceded.<br>
<br>
And so i was at the zone, And me and 5 of my buddy's wanted this camp, we were just waiting for our cler, chanter, mage 3 more wars, and the rest of our melee, and the rest of our guilds and freinds to log on. But we were there! all 5 of us. Just needed 25 more to kill this guy. And like WTF? like vis zoned in and had 40 ppl, so i didnt think much of  it, then they went and killed my mob!!!!!!!<br>
And like man i had my 5 guyz there. So i petitioned so from now on the GM will save the camp from the entire server, just so my friends and guild can log on, Cuz its not fair! i should be allowed to log on whenever i dang well please and have Aall MY mobs up. <br>
<br>
Man Vis mioarer is such a crappy guild, ive never seen so many newbies, im mean come in its obvious! Just becuase ima  looser and ive been playing this game 5 times longer then any one else, and the most biggest raid i can get is a juggs raid DOESNT MEEN i suxor&gt; Man i am so much better then that entiure guild, just becuase i never got any where cuz all i  do is talk @#%$ about ppl and flame ppl for the pure fun of it. still WTF? man i swear im gunna petition for GMS to make me equivelent to Vulak. And while im at it i want his loot. <br>
<br>
So like another time i remember. My friend needed this camp so we just zoned in and went to camp it, but we didnt check to see if any one else was camping it. but i shouldnt have to the entier server i think should resolve around me<br>
oh wait leme add that to my petition<br>
any how so like on the other side of the  hill was vis, but since i failed to check to see if any one was in the zone.<br>
<br>
NO WAIT ya.... thats it... i did check.... VIS WASNT THERE... i swear on my honor!~ they werent there<br>

Any how i bet the entire guild is just like that one gerk off from vis maear. But i never really made an effort to talk to any one in that guild to see what peeps are like, its much easier to assume they are all jerk offs!<br>

That's really all I was trying to say.  Perhaps VM has changed, old assholes have circulated out/sold their accounts ....  however, among many old-school, long-term players (such as myself) have the opinion of vis based on what they've seen for the first 2 years as opposed to the most recent 6 months or so ....<br>

And Mella/Malla, you're seriously one of the only people in Vis that I can and do respect (other than my friends Mugen and Gorce).

No offense Esmalyn but these 2 things stuck out big time on your posts.<br>
<br>
Quote Esmalyn 1<br>
&quot;The majority of members in Vis did not give a sh*t who was in their way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quote Esmalyn 2<br>
&quot;You need to get a f-cking clue and realize I don't care what you think already.&quot; <br>
<br>
Doesnt any one else see the hippocracy here? lol<br>

That's really all I was trying to say. Perhaps VM has changed, old assholes have circulated out/sold their accounts .... however, among many old-school, long-term players (such as myself) have the opinion of vis based on what they've seen for the first 2 years as opposed to the most recent 6 months or so ....<br>

So ummm... if yer gonna live in the past bro... maybe you outta show a bit of compassion for the rest of us and avoid taking us along with you on yer strolls down Memory Lane.<br>
<br>
Vis is Vis is Uber.  They do what they do, and 90% us never actually see them... nor honestly care.  Sure, they had some really notorious individuals in the past... but last I checked, the Moho's and the Biffins are long gone from the guild.<br>
<br>
Give it a rest already.<br>

Do you think Moho's been posting with sincerity or would you call him a troll? Do you nod your head to bullshit? When someone pushes, do you push back or turn the other cheek? Who knows. Maybe you're a better person than I am. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uchikkinchunks.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chikkin Chunks</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(3/29/02 2:44:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=219.topic&index=155>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> lol..</span><hr size=1> When you've had to deal with him in game and on msg boards as long as most of us have, by reflex, you learn to ignore him Esmalyn. <br>

This is true, please refer back to my (edited) first post.  VM is the best guild on any server and everyone knows it.  BoTS farms AoW but they suck.<br>
