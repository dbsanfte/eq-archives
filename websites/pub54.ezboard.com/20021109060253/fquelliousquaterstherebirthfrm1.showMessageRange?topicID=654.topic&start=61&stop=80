Their guidl does send people out to help watch as well, just cause they do not have a dozen people there at one time does not mean they are not suporting them. Alosof the watching being done has been between those working with the list, clerics helping and suporting eachother in game for this. And as a side effect those clerics making some new friends that they might not have had before. And always fun watching the breakdancing wurms when bored. Though wish could adjust the dragons wings so can get Elfwatch on the orb, all I seme to get is the same orange static.<br>

The question is WHY would anyone want to come in and try to break this system, quoting rules and other crap?  Call me naive .....  <br>
<br>
Ok, so Guild A has been sitting in SF for 4 days....Guild B has a cleric ready...Guild B comes in with more force and takes Rage...so Guild B's cleric has a rez stick...most likely to help with uber raids and stuff...while Guild A could have had it's very first epic cleric.   <br>
<br>
Conclusion:  Guild B and their cleric are impatient greedy selfish assholes...but they are going to be a greedy guild with an epic cleric.   There's nothing any of us can really do, but at least people are trying....with the exception of a few greedy selfish assholes.   We all know what the rules are, but do you have to use the rules to justify what I consider rudeness?<br>

<br>
how am I getting personbally flamed by you QuesQuestion?  I have NEVER, nor will I EVER run over someone for a kill.<br>
<br>
I am on of the nicer people in this game and I run to help all the time with everything from logging my cleric to res or druid to port.<br>
<br>
I am stating that although people believe &quot;thier&quot; reservation system is the rule others MUST follow, they are wrong.<br>
<br>
I have never seen a flame here about Wraith/Vis/LC stealing someones spawn in SF.   I have seen the smaller guilds fighting over it, and maybe this may help a bit.   BUT what happens when a guild has a druid running through SF, and that druid then sees RF up, and says in /gu.   The entire guild runs to SF and has say 30 people there while the &quot;reservation commitee&quot; has 15.    the guild with 30 in SF enrages and kills the mob, loots piece and leaves.<br>
<br>
What the guild did is not bannable, or even petitionable.   What the guild did was kill a mob they had to force to kill.<br>
<br>
KEEP IN MIND WRAITH HAS A CLERIC IN THE ROTATION NOW!!!!!!!!!!!   so please dont flame wraith or vis or LC I am saying that some guild will eventually take ragfire without the permission of the reservation commitee sitting in SF, and the system will probrably break at that point.<br>

We are not saying the list group owns the spawn but that we are trying to work as a comunity of players in game to keep comunication up and work on helping eachother compleat their epics. Right now there are several people on the list that was posted who have spent time out there watching the spawn while others slept, having been given the numbers of others to give the a call if he spawns. It is a group that is built on trust and also building friendships. It is a group that hopes to work in the spirit of the Play Nice Policy and not use the letter of the law to create shortcuts or walk over smaller guilds. Some of those in the group are from larger guilds some from smaller guilds. All those who ahve spent timeout there have offered their help and in some case their guildmates have offered as well. It is by no means required or demanded but is a case of players helping players. Some will pull out 'the rules &lt;tm&gt;' and justify that they were right oin storming in and yes by the rules they might be in the legal right. But our goal is to work within the spirit, call me a free love kind of guy and all but believ that we can still work together on this.<br>

I wasnt in any way saying that you have (or would) KS a spawn.  I was flaming your negativity.  A group of clerics came together and started a &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot; of sorts, and are helping each other.  It winds up getting posted here, and suddenly people are coming out of the woodwork to offer up reasons why it's doomed to failure... and listing all of the possible problems.  <br>
<br>
Well... wouldnt it be nice for once if people actually started offering up encouragement for these clerics?<br>
<br>
That is what I'm talking about.  All I'm saying is that the clerics have taken control of the chaos of their final epic battle in a way that is as peaceful and helpful as the class they play... and that it should be encouraged.  Let the clerics be clerics, and let them handle their epic.... and offer them your support, regardless of their guild.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm not helping them because they are LC, LM, Wraith, ADD, or whatever.  I'm helping them because they are doing something that I think is good... and cause it still impresses me that a group of people can be so nice to one another when all we ever hear about is all the BS in this game.<br>
<br>
A lotta people in Quel would do well to pay attention to what these clerics are doing, learn from it, and maybe... just maybe... help to make Quel a better place to game.<br>
<br>
Peace! <p><center>

<br>
1. Why should the Ragefire spawn be different than any other spawn in the game?  Last I looked, there are no enchanters in PoF sitting for 6-18 days for Shissar to pop.  There are no rangers in PoH waiting for the minis or golems to spawn. So why is Rage any different?<br>
<br>
2. Most people cannot afford to take two weeks of RL to sit in one spot waiting for one mob to spawn.  This is 24 hours a day for two weeks.  This takes into account sitting there while the cleric infront of you gets their Ragefire.<br>
<br>
3. The cleric camping it should have full force their with them while waiting for Rage to spawn.  This is only an opinion, but there is no other way to ensure you get Rage when he pops if you dont keep full force there.  Just having a few cleric friends there is not really enough.  I am sorry, but if my guild was not there with me, it would really bug me.  And it also shows you what thier priorities are.  I know, they can be there in 10-15 mins.  But in that time, someone with force there could be done and on the way out.<br>

____________________<br>
<br>
PoH and PoF are not quickly accessable zones where you can just sit there and wait.  Both require a raid to effectively clear and engage for the most part, where Rage can be watched by a solo cleric.<br>

<br>
Agreed.... but this is where guild help is almost essential.  I'll use Syllie as an example.  She works 40 hours a week, so she changed her password, and will have people from LM and DoSG keeping her logging in 24-7 the week leading up to her shot at Rage (and the week before that, we'll have 1-2 groups in SF as often as possible).  The day we hope that he pops, many of us will be taking the day off of work to spend the entire day there, which should discourage any other parties from rushing in to take the spawn away from her.<br>
<br>

Agreed.  See #2 above.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Again... I think a lot of you folks just dont seen to get it.  This isnt about clerics sitting alone on a hill thinking that by doing so, they own a spawn.  That's obviously silly.  It's about clerics respecting each other, and working together.  Those who seem to want Rage seem to have gotten together, setup a gentleman's list, and are respecting it.  The clerics on that list are not only helping/supporting each other, but are also making sure that when their camp times come, that they keep an active presence in the zone.<br>
<br>
Honor.  Respect.  Honesty.  Friendship.  Assistance.  <br>
<br>
And most of all....<br>
<br>
Caring<br>
<br>
And if by now any of you STILL dont get it, I'm truly sorry for you. <p><center>

Several people from the guild of the curent camper had moved closer to the zone ready to log in and help if need arose or to respond. The group of clerics that were working to keep watch cause we all no that the random timer that verant puts in can reall screw with spawns, trade out keep watch so someone was there 24/7 just incase the zone had a memry belch and decided to pop him at some wierd hour.<br>
           Well in what to me was a great thing he poped. Only people in zone were the 4 clerics who were trading shifts to watch. as it was early morning 3 of them were asleep. He poped and over the chat we have for those helping to watch was anounced. Phone calls were made and people who had offered were woken up from theire sleep. In 5 min we had the group there awake as well as people logging on who were logged for the night or were on twinks. Tells were sent to several guilds who had people who have offered to help (this was early morning even a guild like LC VIS or Wraith had only handfull of people on). It was not super fast but about 15 min after he spawns there was a force there to kill him.<br>
        A Force of Lotus Cult, Wraith, Shadowed Sanctuary saw some people with Shadows of the Unseen there. We were all grouped and working together. We did the job, the cleric whose turn it was got the heart and other loot was handled in what all assumed to be a fair maner. For those who think that it cant work realize that the cleric who got the heart, was one of those that were claeed up and woken out of bed. To be honest was cool to see a group of 24 people from diffrent guilds working together to help one person out. I just wish could see more times like that.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> PoH and PoF are not quickly accessable zones where you can just sit there and wait. Both require a raid to effectively clear and engage for the most part, where Rage can be watched by a solo cleric.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
PoH is a place where a ranger could sit and keep checking tracking to see if his mobs are up... and its relitivly safe.  I have done it with a druid and have yet to die from it.  PoF is a bit trickier but could be done.<br>
<br>
A point i am trying to make is that this mob is no different than any other in the game and some people are treating it differently.  Its not 'wrong' for anyone to go and try for Rage.  I hate the fact that VI made this a freaking 6 day spawn.  I am in agreement that Rage should be put up on one of the upper islands in PoA.  <br>
<br>
But i do disagree with a list that has on it &quot;a cleric to be named later&quot; on it.  Which is basically a guild trying to reserver a spot.  If thats the case I would like to reserve 8 or so for my guild.  But I dont think many people would like that.<br>
<br>
IMO, no cleric should need to camp any mobe for upto 18 days.  This spawn should be treated like any of the others, the first there with sufficant force gets a crack at it. I in no way condone KSing from a group that is already engaged, more power too them.<br>

I do understand concern that arrangement not become a reservation system but it wasn't set up that way initially.  It was really only a &quot;Hey, we are friends. We both want the same thing so instead of spending a week here alone trying to win race to spawn and both getting stressed out, let's work together... you go first then it will be my turn.&quot;  People have come in toward the end when Rage was due to spawn.  They were told what was going on and clerics or guilds worked it out... every single time.  So far it hasn't matter whether or not you had LC, Wraith, or a collection of smaller guilds supporting you.  What mattered was that you got in line and lived up to your part of the deal.  Kudos to all who have participated in &quot;gentleman's agreement.&quot;  Sure, one day someone will probably jump the queue because they don't know about it, because they don't want to wait, or because they don't believe in respecting &quot;camps&quot; or player made lists.  But they haven't so far.  Kind of gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.  (Of course, that could be the gnome I just ate.) <p><a href="http://216.118.107.63/SIGS/juror.jpg" target="_blank">

<br>
The PoA idea is a new one to me... but damn it sounds good.  Slap Rage on Isle 7, and bring back CoTH to the zone (no reason not to now that the keys are no longer No Rent).  This way, he's only reachable by a dedicated guild effort, and putting him on 7 helps the Mages who (imo) are so screwed with their epic difficulty as it is.<br>
<br>
But I honestly dunno.  All I know is that I'm gonna be stuck living in SF for 2 weeks to help Syllie... and I hope to be there to pop Rage for the cleric before her.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Rage... can anyone confirm how tough the new Rage is?  I'm guessing that 30 folks 56+ can take him out, and that he has a Fire AE and no Dragon Fear.<br>
<br>
Can any who have battled him shed some light on this?  It'd be greatly appreciated.  So far, all I've been able to dig up is a lot of hearsay. <p><center>

<br>
My opinion: Because the cleric epic is essentially different then any other epics in game. All the other epics for all the other classes are fine weapons indeed, but the cleric epic isn't a weapon at all. It's a force multiplier for guilds in that it allows a guild to recover from a failed engagement in a few minutes versus an hour or so. In that, more attempts on mob X can be made in less time, more successes on mob X can be scored, and more Lewtz X's for the guild as a whole.<br>
<br>
Good luck, all you SF campers. My sympathies are with you. <p><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22703"

Feadorn?  Since you didnt seem to have the pair to answer me ingame, Lemmie ask you here.<br>
<br>
How's it feel bro?  Walking into SF and trying to bully the clerics sitting there.  It make you feel good?  Get your jollies and all, throwing ADD's name around, threatening that if folks werent mobilized and engaging Rage within 10 minutes after he popped, that you (a punk-ass 54 cleric that doesnt even HAVE a 96% rez... much less the skill or patience to get to a respectable level 60) would barrel in a take the spawn?<br>
<br>
Are you a man now?  I hope you think so, cause I think yer a punk.  I think yer a pathic inbred piece of pond scum.  And to THINK that you are an officer of a guild as big as ADD makes me physically ill.  <br>
<br>
What the hell were you trying to prove?  You think those clerics dont already know that they have to have the necessary forces on hand when rage is about to pop (which wont be for DAYS to come)?  Get real.<br>
<br>
You sir are a disgrace to your Guild, to your class, and to this server.... and you make me sick.<br>
<br>
And you can rest assured that by the time I'm done, everyone on Quelious is going to know what a low-life piece of trash you are.<br>
<br>
Have a nice day! <p><center>
