<br>
<br>
Remember when you thought 200p at a vendor was a good deal for a hammer of flattening? (maybe this was just me, i was saving up so i could buy it for my druid)<br>
Remember the first time someone shouted they were going to kunark, and everyone else in the zone shouted back &quot;You can't go there..that's a HIGH lvl place, you shouldn't go there till atleast lvl 35&quot;<br>
Remember the first time you were ever in a group? (that was truly exhilerating)<br>
Remember the first time you were &quot;Given&quot; an item? (for me it was that UBER axe of the iron back - now scrap metal)<br>
Remember when your &quot;epic&quot; was gonna take you forever to get, when it was a status symbol - and when it was the UBEREST* thing you could get? (or in short - when it was actually worth your time)<br>
<br>
AND finally<br>
<br>
Remember camping the orc trainer in Crushbone ALL DAY so you could get the &quot;UBER&quot; shiny brass sheild<br>
<br>
<br>
I think SoL and all it's Uberness has totally unbalanced the game - now i took my lvl 25 upto ME and got a Goranga spiked club, 12 23 5ac 2str that's better than the weapons most post 50s used pre velious<br>
<br>
with velious things were still relatively balanced, but SoL has Screwed up EQ to epic proportions<br>
<br>
           *Don't tell me UBEREST isn't a word, cause i looked it up...and UBER isn't a word either...wonder how that started... <p>Harill <Br>

Remember when /consent let you loot the person's corpse?<br>
I also remember the trainer camp in crushbone, oh such a pain. Or when someone shouted Dvinn was loose and half the pple in the zone ran to the zone and beat on him till they died or zoned and dvinn waited in his corner.  You always knew he was loose when you got to crushbone zone and saw 15 pple waiting.<br>
Remember when screaming maces were THE 1hb?  Avenger battle axes? bloodforge hammers?  Yes i remember the bladed thulian claws too..i think i bought mine for 1k<br>
Remember when the bazaar started on quell in ec?<br>
Remember the de in MM when he had the shield? KS KS KS.<br>
Remember when HG's dropped all the plat and not gold?<br>
Heck i remember when FS weaps and mino axes were the bomb and wisps were left to the casters.<br>
Remember when you could actually find a group in unrest cuz there were 20-30 pple there and still train the zone?<br>
I remember seeing a necro killing rangers in LF thinking wow, he is awesome.<br>
I remember when pple thought enchanters stunk cuz no one knew what exactly they did.<br>

And I thought he was the richest guy I knew. <br>
<br>
Mostly ranger thoughts below...<br>
<br>
-When ivy etched armor actually sold for more than what it cost to do the quest.<br>
<br>
-Finally getting chosen for the elite room in blackburrow.<br>
<br>
-Being able to camp the elite ledge by yourself and make a ton of money from it.<br>
<br>
-Swimming across the lake in Halas because you didn't know there was a boat and thinking you were gonna drown before you got to the other side.<br>
<br>
-Running blind through the Surefall Tunnel for 10 minutes or more only to end up where you started.<br>
<br>
- Finally seeing Talym Shoontar in Qeynos Hills at lvl 15 and thinking since you started playing to do the quest only to get a buckler and a few silver for your effort. And actually appreciate the reward. <p><img src="http://home.earthlink.net/~gattaka/_uimages/cat.jpg"></img>

<br>
I always did that when away from home for a long time. Barbarians rule =)<br>
<br>
How about...<br>
<br>
-Camping Gnoll Brewers 20 hours a day because your ranger friend _desperately_ needed a &quot;good&quot; cloak<br>
<br>
-Selling FS weapons to players for 10pp each and having them thank you because it was such a great price<br>
<br>
-Smithing with a Chanter mule because they had such great Int and Cha. Who needs strength?<br>
<br>
-When the scariest thing in Kith was a ghoul because your little halfling butt didn't have a magic weapon yet<br>
<br>
-Duel wielding Mino Axes because they looked so cool<br>
<br>
-Role playing =(<br>
<br>
-Chain casting summon water in the tunnel to Blackburrow because the animations gave off a flash of light letting you could see on a CR<br>
<br>
-Buffing yourself with Feet Like Cat because you _knew_ that it made you run that much faster.<br>

I shout &quot;WOOT! I'm home&quot; too whenever I zone into Everfrost.  Usually someone responds with &quot;Welcome back!&quot;  Must be a barbarian thing.<br>
<br>
Aye, I remember Martar.  As soon as I was old enough, I asked a druid friend of mine to go with me to track him down and bring him to justice.  I still wear his cloak from time to time.<br>
<br>
Non-barbarians, non-humans, and non-Erudites still don't appreciate their ability to see in the dark.  Chain casting spells sure beats killing fire beetles just to get their eyes.<br>
<br>
When I was young, I spent most of my time hunting with Darlea, Auburn, and Yahriel.  We would pick up another friend or two then decide where to adventure that day.  I ended up marrying Yahriel.  She left Norrath last year as did Darlea and Auburn.  Only Darlea has returned. <p><a href="http://216.118.107.63/SIGS/juror.jpg" target="_blank">

Remember your group getting wiped out on Orc hill?<br>
<br>
How about being eternally greatful to someone for sharpening your rusty 2 handed sword? (Thanks Rizom)<br>
<br>
Or seeing the Wizard spires for the first time and believing someone who told you you could use them to travel to the moon. (Okay, maybe they were being prophetic)<br>
<br>
Or being 5th level and travelling all the way from Kelethin to Freeport with a friend who gets jumped in EFP and dies without binding? (Sorry Beth)<br>
<br>
Not learning your lesson, you go back to Freeport to get jumped by a Madman in NRo, still being 5th<br>
<br>
Being a glutton for punishment and going back to NRo to hunt rattlesnakes with a wizard who is baffled by you not knowing what Taunt is. (I forgot his name  )<br>

After all, that's how it is on the map!!<br>
<br>
The days (and long nights!) at the icy orcs..<br>
<br>
My friend saying, &quot;Trust me, I know the way out&quot;  when we fell in that damn tree in BB.  Then trying to find my way back about 6 times down that dark tunnel.<br>
<br>
Killing green con mobs for weeks..wondering why I didn't get any higher in lvl, but learning valuable skills and making long time friends in the process.  Then learning how to con things!<br>
<br>
<br>
I remember running through WK at one point..on one of my trips to and from Qeynos/Freeport.  I had done it several times by this point and was comfortable with the &quot;Run by the water&quot; method.  I got brave <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I decided it would be faster if I just ran straight across WK instead of by the water! Found some nice farmers that I could stop and talk to....  Then spent hours looking for my corpse because for some reason those farmers didn't like barbarians!!<br>
<br>
Remember when..<br>
...the LoTW quest was worth doing?<br>
...Bloodforge Hammer...<br>
...shamans couldn't use spears?<br>
...before Paw was revamped?<br>
...wizards didn't port for donations? Only for friends? <br>
...everytime you zoned you lost your guild tag?<br>
<br>
So many memories...<br>

Hour long CR's in Black Burrow and running down there from Everfrost, blind in the tunnel...(spawn with your stuff after dying pre-10)<br>

Hell levels at 30 (OMG), 35 (30 wasn't so bad), 40 (UGGGG), etc...<br>
