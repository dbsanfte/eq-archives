<br>
1) Most apologies are insincere.<br>
<br>
2)  The apologies of a criminal relate more to their getting caught rather than real remorse.<br>
<br>
3) After the threat of prosecution abates or sentence is imposed old behaviors resurface shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>
4)  The reason there is a high recidivism rate is the old &quot;forgive and forget&quot; without any real meaningful consequences.    Punishment of the accused for the past deeds must take place.  Rehab is nice, but it must go hand in hand with punishment, specific deterrent of this accused and general deterrent  for those who know about their crime and hear of the punishment.<br>
<br>
Sendole -- this is just for you -- I have seen your type to know that your day is coming.  You are a criminal. A thief. You are a conviction waiting to happen. You can minimize your behavior by saying it is a game -- but check out how much items in this game go for in real life in real dollars.<br>
<br>
Son, someday, probably sooner rather than later, you will be going to jail, because you think are just too smart to get caught in real life and do your scams in the real world.  Everquest is  just a stepping stone.  When you are a guest of the Georgia department of corrections or, worse, a county jail.  Just remember how your thieving and criminal history started -- in &quot;just a game&quot;<br>
<br>
You will have no one to blame but yourself -- but your type will blame somebody else in the end.<br>

Actually.. I know I'm quite stupid.. And I've already been caught red-handed many times, and I'm accepting, and fessing up to it. I'm not afraid of what I deserve, hell If I really felt I deserved to go to jail, then book me up now. But I don't. I'm not an account hacker/thief like I'm said to be. Sure, I'm bad for accepting this Gnome mask. But to be _completely_honest_, I didn't know who it belonged to. My goal isn't to outsmart anyone. I can't. You people are much, much brighter than I will ever be, I can openly admit that. I just want to make things right, and take responsibility. Sure, you may say me pointing fingers at all is deviating the full responsibilty. But with the acceptance of responsibility comes TRUTH. It is _not_ my complete fault. If it was my complete fault, no other names would have been mentioned, hence why I tried to keep the real hacker a secret.. I really didn't know who he was. I assumed he was who he claimed to be, but it was a blatent lie. Me coming up and, and giving all I can to make things right _isn't_ a blatent lie.<br>
<br>
Believe me or not, I want to put things the way they should be.<br>
<br>
Quoting Bubbalotski again:<br>
You will have no one to blame but yourself -- but your type will blame somebody else in the end.<br>
-----<br>
I can see why you'd say this.. but like I mentioned earlier in this reply. To accept the full responsibility, I have to open up the facts that there are others just as responsible as me. I need to keep it open as possible to exlude any lying.<br>
<br>
That's all I can really say..<br>

I am accepting the blame for everything. I am not pointing fingers at anyone, I am simply saying that I had the wrong friends at the wrong times, and now I have to accept full responsibility, whether it be from what they did, or what I did. However, these other people who _might_ be involved, could help you, me, and anyone else who got '@#%$ over'.<br>
---------<br>
<br>
why the recitience to name names?  How about the name fo your scammer friend (here and on the other server(s)?  I'm sure folks would like to know who to avoid.<br>
<br>
How about the name of the guy you're supposedly dealing with to  get the mask back?  Perhaps some  folks can sweeten the deal for him so that it gets back where it belongs.<br>
<br>
For that matter,  how about the name of the GM (or GMs) you dealth with?  A quick tell (or email) can take long steps to corroborate your story?<br>
<br>
<br>
Not that I expect you to supply ANY of these names...  I truly beleive they dont exist as separate people (except possibly the GM... if you DID talk to one.)<br>
<br>
See, I see your operation running like this:  you've got a stable of accounts with characters on Quellious (and maybe other servers).  You're careful in what access mechanisms you use to control the IP address they appear to come from.. (It's not THAT hard.... from my home I have access to IP's from 3 DHCP servers serving different ranges... and that doesn't even consider hard-coding the IP addresses.)<br>
<br>
You're running a shell game with items and money attempting to keep a few accounts &quot;clean&quot; so that they dont get banned... and trying to recover the rep on one of them so folks will allow you access to places where you can't get on your own....<br>
<br>
<br>
Bubba's got you pegged...  I just hope I see the story in the AJC when you get nailed.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It would suck to eat unrezzed deaths over and over again while you are on &quot;no rez&quot; lists.<br>
<br>
However, you seem to have friends like yourself.  I remember when my guild was camping Lodi...we left a cleric and tank there to wait the minimum time...you and your friends came in and reminded us that it was FFA.  Yes...Khatup, Sonhippaur, Liuim, and Washou.  Liuim saying it was Washou's desire to get the shell... he just wanted &quot;a chance at the shell&quot;.  Even with 30 of our members there, you called in MB wizards.  Poor Filamarie, camped there for 14 hrs (Liuim arguing it wasn't 16...darn 2 hours makes a big diff)...you and your crew could care less.  Then we allowed you to enter in a HoT pick up raid, some of us forget names...and funny that Sonhippaur declared war on our guild after we asked you to leave when members remembered WHO you all were.<br>
<br>
I'd like to be forgiving because &quot;mistakes&quot; happen.  It's very hard to forgive someone who intentionally and carelessly sets out to do others harm.  *shrug*<br>

<br>
For those of you who have forgotten or didn't read it closely, in the first post of the &quot;Warnings? Tips?....&quot; thread, &quot;Casey Croft&quot; said the following:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  With just mere words you can bend a person into beliveing anything. With just a few solemn words you can make them do your every bidding.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I will go over a classic exampl of social engineering that I have seen work time and time agian.  I call this the &quot;Ladder Branch&quot; technique. It is where you obtain the account information to one account and use that account to branch out and get others. Example. You have been in a guild for a litle over a month. You start to gain alot of the members trust and loyalty. So you scamper over to one of your new friends and ask them to share accounts with you. Ofcourse them being niave like most of the Everquest community is they will GLADY just hand you the info to their account over. Sound to easy? Try it and be amazed of the stupidty. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Question: To a con artist, what's more thrilling than scamming someone and getting away with it?<br>
<br>
Answer: Getting caught, heck even admitting your actions and your guilt, then talking your way out of punishment, and even regaining the trust of people who are aware of your past actions.  (Thus allowing you to continue to con folks.)<br>
<br>
&quot;Sendole&quot; may not be Casey.  &quot;Sendole&quot; may have even severed all ties with Casey.  But as others have already pointed out, &quot;Sendole&quot; is still protecting his &quot;friends back in the day.&quot;<br>
<br>
To repeat a recurring saying on this sequence of threads:<br>
Sendole and his friends fooled the Quellious server once by making people think they were trustworthy.  Shame on THEM.<br>
If you, the reader, decide from Sendole's posts and current actions in game that he is now suddenly trustworthy and has changed completely, shame on YOU.<br>

Oh my goddess... to see such feelings on a person I have pretty much given up on fills me with such emotion... Makes me want to email him my player info and give him access to all my household's accounts....HELL NO!!<br>

Jesus kid, I can't believe you'd think that by changing the way you talk or maybe even paying someone to write a nice letter on your behalf you'd get all of us to drop down on our knees and begin chanting praises to your name *shakes head* You want to make Quellious a better place? Delete your account and stick to the PS2.<br>

One song comes to mind here and I'll end up by quoting a part that summarizes what I think of you....<br>
<br>
The evidence before the court is incontravertible.<br>
There's no need for the jury to retire.<br>
In all my years of judging I have never heard before,<br>
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of the law.<br>
The way you made them suffer,<br>
Your exquisite wife and mother,<br>
Fills me with the urge to defecate! -- No, Judge, the jury!<br>
Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear,<br>
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers.<br>
Tear down the wall!<br>

2)wouldnt want him in my guild simply cuz it would give us a bad name no matter how good of a player he may be <br>
<br>
3) honestly bubba your statement in regards to crimnals never goin straight is crap i know cuz i used to be one myself sorry guys i did some bad @#%$ hanging with the wrong people i have sense started playing eq focased my time on eq and not hanging with those people i thank the people in eq and the game itself for that weither you guys may know it or not i stopped doin what i did drugs jacking people beating people up etc =p so people can change there ways or there colors <br>
<br>
4) some of the people involved in this sendole hassel khatup salivi sato whateva @#%$ were friends people in lc you guys gainjed the trust from were friends and now have to deal with the fact you impersonated them to do your scams i dont blame quel for hating you one bit whoeva is involved in this but i also think you may have got in deep enough to know you really fuked up some people are hard headed and dont see @#%$ till its to late i am one who can voche for that i am pissed that you took advantage of people that alot of people on quel cared about that was wrong.<br>
<br>
5) plain and simple your best bet is to leave quel if you chose not to then live with it but to all you people who love to bash just cuz find something else to do igts mainly between the people who scammed and him he needs to make up for it rest of quel should go about there business people change its a matter of do you think you should or not i chose to stop doin xstupid @#%$ 4 years ago and havnt since so just sit bak and think before you bash ....<br>
<br>
Btw this was not a statement in any way shape or form to help sendole but simply to say were all humn we fuk up and its done with no one can change it were all sorry it happend and if i can help let me know i will gladly put up what i have in my bank to help those who lost things and couldnt get it bak just be human people and remember that..........<br>
