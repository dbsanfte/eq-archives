Because it's easy to make assumptions when you're uneducated on the matter.  Remember when people thought D&amp;D was satanic 15 years ago?  It's like that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Bala, we are insensitive because Shawn Woolley's mother is insensitive to us.  Yes, his death was tragic and unwarranted, but if she must blame someone for the tragedy, she should've blamed herself.  Sure she didn't point the gun to her son's head, no more than the game, the computer or Sony/Verant did, but she has the ultimate responsibility for the well being of her child.  She admitted to CBS that Shawn had emotional and mental problems prior to playing EQ.  Any decent parent, regardless of their child's age, would seek help for him and keep a close eye on him to prevent such incidences.  She said that when she found him dead what she saw was EQ on his monitor.  But there were also plenty of empty pizza boxes laying around.  If she didn't blame EQ she would've blamed the pizza restaurant who delivered his pizza.  She's willing to blame everyone but herself for her son's death.<br>
<br>
We all are addicted to EQ at one point or another but for CBS to report it in a bundle as addictions along with serial killers and drug addicts is unfair.  Thousands of people play EQ every day and I'm sure there are other emotionally and mentally unstable people in the game who get by just fine.  I'm very sympathetic to the situation and tragedy, but I'm umsympathetic to his mother and her crusade against EQ.  She was irresponsible for caring for her son, and now she's blaming those he gamed with and the game he was on before his death.  I think she plenty convicted herself when she admitted that he had problems to begin with.  Yes, Shawn's moving out was a big step towards his road to recovery but Rome wasn't built in one day.  She can't possibly think that just by him moving out meant that he was well did she?  Shouldn't she have kept a close eye on hm anyways to prevent something like this especially knowing that he has issues?  She should've sought him help, and be aware of his activities?  Who in their right mind thinks that a person living by himself with no job can survive properly?  She lived to tell the media that her son had quit his job and blame EQ for his death, so it's obvious she knew about it.  Why didn't she do something about it?  Why didn't she get more involved in her emotionally troubled son's life? <p><TABLE>
