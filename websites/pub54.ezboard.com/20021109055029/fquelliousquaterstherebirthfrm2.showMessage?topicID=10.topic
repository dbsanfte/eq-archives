A powerful word is it not? Some believe that man makes his own future. Then there are those that believe they are set on a path since birth. Who can say who is right? However,life, be it destined or man-made, is not without a sense of irony. I would like to share a tale of destiny. An acolyte's tale.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Times are changing young Tytus,&quot; stated Valeron Dushire to the squire. &quot;How so my lord?&quot; the half-elven youth responded. &quot;I can rememeber a time when a half breed, not saying that in a bad way mind you, would not be allowed as a member of the Hall of Truth.&quot; &quot;By Marr! It seems like yesterday, but at the same time feels like two lifetimes.&quot; Valeron said with a half hearted laugh. &quot;Now look at how far we have come. You will be accepted as a paladin initate in just under twenty-four hours. Your father would be proud to see you know.&quot; Valeron stated with a hint of pain in his voice. The squire responded, &quot;I wish he were still here. My heart weighs heavy everyday.&quot; Valeron grasped Tytus on the shoulder. &quot;I miss him to lad. He was a great man. I just hope I have honored him well by raising you the best I can. He would be all too proud. He never thought you would be able to become a paladin in the service of the Lightbringer lad.&quot; The young one perked up a bit. &quot;You honor him well my lord, and when I am initiated on the morrow I will honor you in the same way. I will defend the Temple of Marr with my all. For this is the only family I have now.&quot; Valeron made a motion for Tytus to follow him back to the hall and stated, &quot; I know you will lad. You have an intesity as your father did. Your devotion is like none I have seen in a long time. You are a true zealot. Just be careful lad. For the blood that courses through a zealots vains can be a double edged sword. Learn to control it and you service to Marr will be untested. Lose control and madness will over take you.&quot; Without saying a word the young squire pondered this as they walked back to the hall. The madness he thought. I have struggled with this my entire life. Torn between two worlds, and excepted in neither. Sure the Temple took him in, but only because Valeron demanded so. He was never fully accepted. But on the morrow he would begin his quest to prove his devotion. He would be one of them, a paladin of Marr.<br>
<br>
  Years had past since the day Tytus Steele was initiated into the Hall of Truth as a paladin of Marr. His memories of Valeron were found ones. He would make the occasional journey back to Freeport, but these were becoming few and far between. Tytus had been wanted by the Freeport Militia for some time now. This made it hard to go back to his old home. Tytus had finally proven himself to the Hall and the Temple, but the cost was dire. He could rarely visit the ones he strived so hard to be accepted by, because of the constant battle with the Militia. Freeport was no longer safe for him. Tytus moved a bit further west into High Hold Pass. Tytus was not accepted completely at first, for the resisdents were weary of paladins. But he proved himself an ally in a siege on the Shralok orc camp. Sealing Chief Shralok's fate in a glorius battle. Then he was called upon again to defend the pass against the Mucktail Gnolls. Sir Tytus Steele was a hero among the residents of Highpass. Not forgeting his training Tytus conquered both tribes in the name of Marr,a name that was never used around these areas. However, as long as Tytus was defending the pass the resisdents did not care what name he conquered adversaries in. It was shortly after the Mucktail war Tytus was introduced to Carson McCabe. Tytus rarely ventured into the pass, since it was against his faith to partake in the activities of within. Tytus was, however, interested to learn why Carson McCabe could possibly want to meet him. Being that McCabe was his own law in the Keep, a high moral paladin could only hinder his operation. That was the thouht of Tytus. As Tytus entered the Keep and made his way to McCabe's quarters the High Keep nobles he passed would wisper. He knew it was about him he had become accustomed to this. Not only a paladin but a half breed at that. Tytus neared the quarters of Carson McCabe. The guards looked at him dubiously, but he seemed to be paying no attention. Instead he was in some way awestruck by the beauty of the Keep. One of the guards opened the door, and Tytus began to come out of this trance. There in the room stood a stately man. He did not look like the scoundrel Tytus had imagined. Carson McCabe turned to Tytus with a warm smile upon his face. &quot;Hail Sir Tytus Steele.&quot; McCabe said with a well spoken and somewhat suave voice. &quot;I must say I am glad you accepted my invitation to the Keep. I had my doubts a man of your beliefs would come you know?&quot; Before McCabe could say another word Tytus boomed out in a commanding paladin voice, &quot;Get to the point sir! What could you possibly want to meet with me for!? Im sure a man of your reputation could not fathom my beliefs!&quot; &quot;O to the contrary noble sire. We are not so diferent you and I. You are a defender as am I, but we just defend different morals. Nevertheless you are a man to the point. I like that.&quot; McCabe smirked wryly. &quot;Very well I have an offer for you. You can guess that stories of your bravery have reached the Keep and I have a small problem that needs to be solved. We have been under siege by Pickclaw goblins. A very unsavory lot you know. Well long story short it is bad for business. I am in desperate need. My guards are strong, but from what I hear your amazing powers, from prayer, are like nothing seen around these parts. Do not get me wrong I will accomodate you. You will have free passage around the Keep. You live in the royal quarters. I will even let you have your time to meditate and pray to your diety. You can conquer these foul beasts in whatever name you want. We can work together. Im not an evil man Sir Tytus. It is true I love money, but you can have your own beliefs I do not care.&quot; McCabe sinced he was losing Tytsu and had to come up with something quick. &quot;Innocent people are dying here! Can you, in good faith, turn your back on them?&quot; In this statement McCabe saw a fire in the eyes of Tytus. He knew then the defense had been broken and he had him where he wanted him. Tytus agreed to the terms and began his siege on the foul goblins. Tytus became well known around the Keep. With the help of many adveturers and mercenaries the Keep was once again safe. Tytus was heralded as a hero and the Keep became his home. He felt wanted there. But the longer he stayed there the more his power wained. He kept prayers and meditation regular but the power was not as intense. Tytus credited this to lack of battle, but anyone who was in the service of Marr could have detected it was because he was slipping away from the light.<br>

Dreams like none he had ever known. Dreams so life like he thought he was awake. Visions would ruch to him and rush away. He saw an elven maiden holding a babe and waiving goodbye to his father. The maiden then wispered, &quot;You are the Father's prize Tytus. Born of two worlds.&quot; Then in an instant the maidens face took on the look of something more evil, a dark elf. Only for a moment then it went back to the face of the elven maiden. His mind raced on. He watched his father battle with the Militia. His father, a proud knight of Marr, slaying gaurd after guard only to take a fatal blow from behind by that bastard Lucan D'Lere. His thoughts raced forward. His father on his death bed. &quot;Take care of him Valeron. Raise him as your own.&quot; &quot;I will raise him to honor you Jusdan. You have served the Lightbringer well brother. The plane of valor awaits you.&quot; Faster the thoughts race. Blurred visions. Voices speaking in a language he has never heard. Another clear vision. A red sky filled with thousands of dragons. He can see himself off in the distance. He knows its a vision of himself  but he looks different. Next to him is standing a knight, appearing to be of gypsie descent, the knight weilds a blade that hungers for god's blood. They both stand saluting as they look across a field where hundreds of armies lay slain. Tytus's mind begins to race again. Faster and faster. He tries to understand what is being said, but it only makes him feel as if his head will epxlode. Then nothing. A calm. Then a soft voice. A voice that has the care of a mother speaking softly to her child. &quot;You must head west my child.&quot; Tytus then sits upright in his bed. The dreams so real. Tytus decides to gather his things that next morning and move west. He had heard rumor of a Mucktail uprising in the Plains of Karana, along with frequent bandit attacks. Maybe this was where he needed to be. Conquering the plains for the glory of Marr.<br>
<br>
  Tytus crusaded in the Karanas for many moons. Slaying the lot of gnolls and bandits, but he felt just as empty. His power was fading more now than ever. He felt farther away from the light as ever. He decided he must make a journey back to the Temple to commune with Marr. Tytus made plans to leave the next morning. However on that night destiny would play its hand.<br>
<br>
  Tytus was at a local farm gathering supplies for his journey when he noticed two women coming down the path. Upon closer look he could tell they were Tier'Dal. Not just any women. One was wearing dark golden colored color armor that bore the symbol of Innoruuk on the crest. She was obviously a cleric of hate. The other wore robes of the arcane. Tytus could tell she was a necromancer by the skeletal guardian that followed her. The farmers seemed to fear them, but not enough to run or attack. It was more of a respect sort of fear. The cleric caught a glimpse of Tytus and stopped. She called over the necromancer, in her native tongue. They conversed a minute looking at Tytus with seething hatred. Tytus placed his hand on the hilt of his sword and said a half hearted prayer to Marr. At that moment the cleric spoke in common, &quot;Well sister, it appears we have come upon a weakling paladin. This is no follower of Nife either.&quot; The necromancer spoke, &quot;No my sister by the looks of his medallion he is a follower of Marr. Even more disgusting.&quot; The cleric chuckled slightly. &quot;O so true sister.&quot; She then gestured to Tytus, &quot;So tell me half breed, what brings you this far away from home. A prissy little paladin such as yourself could get their little face mangled in such a place, and we all know you weak paladins cant stand that.&quot; Tytus gritted his teeth with a furious anger. &quot;I suggest you shut your mouth wench, or I will seperate that, along with the rest of your head, from your body!&quot; The necromancer scoffed. &quot;A fiery one. You will make an excellent sacrifice to the Father.&quot; Tytus unsheathed his sword masterfully. The necromancer sent her pet in. Expecting this Tytus had already had a prayer on his lips and expulsed the damned corpse to wherever it came from. He was then quickly struck by a prayer from the cleric. Then he felt his life force ebb away to the necromancer. Tytus concentrated on the necromancer. He lunged toward her. She stepped into the shadows. Sensing her behind him he swung around and bashed her with his shield. This stunning her, Tytus pounced with a flurry of sword blows. The necromancer was out of the way but not dead. He turned to the cleric who had once again struck him down with a powerful prayer. The she healed her sisters wounds. Tytus was know too tired to go on. He layed his hands upon his chest saying a small prayer. Tytus was on his feet again only knowing he was about to die. Expecting a full on attack he steadied himself,  but it never came. Instead the two women stared off into the distance. They both then fell to their knees speaking once again in their native tongue to someone who wasnt there. When they arose they no longer looked to Tytus with hatred, but instead with astonishment. Tytus shouted, &quot;Finish it you miserable wenches! I am prepared to meet my fate!&quot; The two women began to laugh histerically. This only angered Tytus more. &quot;Are you two mad!? Fight me!&quot; The cleric only looked at Tytus and said, &quot;You have no idea do you? You are just a lost soul.&quot; Tytus could only chuckle at the two insane women. The necromancer stated, &quot;Well the guards will be here soon to check on the uproar. This place will not be safe. You need to follow us.&quot; Tytus followed reluctantly. His instinct told him to leave for Freeport immediately, but he was drawn by the Tier'Dal sisters. They led Tytus to a small camp. There were a few others there. A barbarian and two humans. Mercenaries obviously. They gave Tytus a strange look as the paladin approached with the sisters. It was no more than  a look then they went back to their business. Tytus was introduced and greeted. He noticed down the hill a ways form them was a druid ring. It appeared as though the druids were having some sort of ritual. Tytus scoffed to himself, never caring too much for druids and their hethen ways. The majestic barbarian then stood and said,&quot; Alright people time to earn our living.&quot; They all stood. Warriors equipped weapons, caster opened spell books, and clerics began prayers. In an instant they were attacking the unsuspecting druids. Tytus could sense the evil all around. He felt ill watching the slaughter take place. His first instinct was to flee this evil place, but then he heard the soft voice again. &quot;Child your destiny begins here. Cull these weak druids. Surely you have no pity for those that waste prayers on nature. Be strong!&quot; With that Tytus joined the battle. When all the druids had been slain, the party made its way back up the hill and set of camp for the night. Laying in his tent, Tytus felt the fire burn within him again. The fire of a zealot. But as he nodded off the dreams attacked him once again. More intense than ever. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utytus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tytus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0> at: 5/6/01 6:10:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utytus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tytus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/6/01 7:06:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tale continued.</span><hr size=1>   Visions rushed through Tytus's mind. The voices torment him still. He then focused on a being worshipped by thousands of Tier'Dal and Human alike. He knew it was the deity Innoruuk. He felt a hate rise in him. Innoruuk looked at Tytus and spoke. &quot;You can hate me all you want Tytus. Hate is good. But you will be my prize. You will be the fall of the light&quot;. The deity then gave the most sinister laugh Tytus had ever heard. It made his blood curdle. He felt ill and began to wretch. Then the sky parted and a crystalline dragon descended. Words cannot describe the creature. In an instant the dragon layed waste to all the worshipers. Then turned to Innoruuk. &quot;You can not have him Innoruuk he belongs to me.&quot; Innoruuk began to seethe with fury. &quot;Damn you wurmqueen he is mine!! It is my time to rule and not even the great Veeshan can stop that! It has been set in motion.&quot; The dragon sat in an offensive postion. &quot;Dont be a fool. You can not possibly think you can defeat me. One swipe of my claw would lay waste to your entire plane of existance and everything in it.&quot; Innoruuk gave a dark smirk. &quot;We shall see. Minions of Hate your Father beckons you!!&quot; The dragon snatched Tytus into one claw and fled with him, calling her dragons to aid her escape. The visions ceased. There was nothing again. Then the voices. Tytus was able to comprehend them now. It was the voices of dragons speeking in their awesome tongue. Voices that could bring life and death all at the same time. Tytus had been brought before the Ring of Scale. The dragons looked upon him with curiosity. Then the soft mothers voice spoke, &quot;Welcome home my child. I have been searching for you. It was only when you faded from the light of Marr that I found you.&quot; The dragons all let out a triumphant roar. Tytus was confused and a bit weary. &quot;Why have you been searching for me? Am I truely damned now and you have come to collect my soul?&quot; The dragon said softly, &quot; No dear one you are not damned, just the opposite. You have been saved. Saved from the misguided teachings of Marr. You have been feeling empty child. You have noticed your powers leaving I am sure. I want to rekindle that fire. I want to make it burn hotter than ever. I need you to serve me. The time has come for this world I created to know its one true Queen.&quot; Tytus then began to comprehend. &quot;Veeshan&quot; he wispered to himself. &quot;Yes my child it is I.&quot; the dragon said reassuringly. &quot;I have someone you need to meet. He was in your place not too long ago. I think he can better help enlighten you.&quot; A door opened and out stepped the knight of gypsie descent. He was followed by a blade fashioned from Veeshan's crytal claws. It was difficult to tell if the man controlled the blade or if it were the other way around. He was a magnificent sight none the less. &quot;Hello brother&quot; he stated extending his hand. &quot;We have been expecting you. This is all overwhelming I know, but everything will be made clear very soon. I will just say you and I have much work to be done.&quot; With that the gypsie disappeared into the shadows. Then the dragon spoke again. &quot;So tell me child. Do you want to go back to your tormented existance, or would you rather serve me and have a purpose in your life.&quot; The words were sweet intoxication. It is what Tytus had longed for, a meaning to his life. His choice was clear. &quot;I will serve you my Queen. You lead and I shall follow.&quot; The prisitine dragon smiled. &quot;Oh no child. You will not follow. You will lead the way. I have my champion already. I need you to be my acolyte. My avatar. You two will be leaders and destroyers of men, and you will do it all in the name of your Queen.&quot; The visions left Tytus once again. It was dark. He awoke to find himself still in camp, but he was alone. &quot;What happened to the sisters and the mercenaries?&quot; he thought. He wondered how long he had been asleep. He also wondered if the dream was real. Tytus felt as if he was going mad. Then in the distance he saw a figure walking toward him. As it drew closer he realized it was the knight of gypsie descent, and he was followed by the crystal claw. When the knight approached the spoke. &quot;Gather your things brother. We have much to do in limited time. Dominion is at hand.&quot; The gypsie smiled and then the sword began to hum. &quot;I know you thirst for god's blood. God's blood you shall have.&quot;<br>

Her acolyte lead the way spreading her vengence along with her champion. They and the horde of dragons layed waste to all that opposed the Queen. Several dieties had fallen to her wrath. The crystal claw got its god's blood. Veeshan's champion brought wrath and Tytus brought the word leading the Queen's army to victory after victory. But destiny is not without a sense of irony.<br>
<br>
Tytus was a true zealot. He was a lover of the cause and nothing else. Along his travels he met a beautiful warrioress. She was a half breed like him. She helped his cause and she understood him. He never thought he could love anyone but his Queen but he was wrong. He charm and beauty enthralled him. Ambi showed Tytus a love he never knew could exist. This did not set well with Veeshan. She is a jealous queen that demands complete devotion. Upon seeing this she tried her powers of persuasion to get Tytus to slay Ambi. He would not do it. Veeshan had lost her hold on him. Tytus eventually gave up the crusade. He married Ambi and settled down in High Keep. Ambi's love kept Veeshan away. But it was when the two were apart Veeshan made her move.<br>
<br>
The Wurmqueen is spiteful. She knew that she could never have him again. But at the same time she could not let the knight born of two worlds live. True zealots are dangerous. They fight fiercely for their beliefs and Tytus was a zealot. He was a menace to Veeshans plot. The Queen assaulted Tytus's mind with doubt and with morbid visions. After many months he went mad. She enough control over him now to finish him. She led Tytus back to Freeport. She would destroy him and those damned followers of Marr for corrupting what should have been her perfect avatar.<br>
<br>
Tytus entered North Freeport in a daze. He was greeted by Sir Breel who was just a squire when Tytus left. &quot;Could it be? Sir Tytus Steele? By Marr it is so good to see you after so long!!&quot; Tytus drew his sword and with one a masterful slash beheaded Breel where he stood. The assualt began. He layed waste to any paladin that stood in his way to the Hall of Truth. At the hall he had the full powers of Veeshan guiding him he took out most of the guard. Sentries came running from the Temple to assist in the defense. Tytus's body was battered. It was only the power of Veeshan that kept him going. She was not finished yet. Tytus made it to the top level of the Hall and stood face to face with Valeron Dushire. Valeron called off the assault. Tears welling up in Valeron's eyes he looked upon the shell that used to be the boy he raised. &quot;What sort of evil has done this to you son?&quot; Son. The word pierced through the powers that Veeshan held over Tytus. She had lost him again. In her last fit of rage she struck him down. Valeron rushed to Tytus's broken body laying on the stone floor. Tytus looked up and Valeron with emotion pouring out of him as he lay dying. &quot;You called me son. I failed my birth father, and I have failed the only father I have ever really known. Can you forgive me?&quot; Valeron looked past all the blood and the wounds on the face and only saw that boy he had raised as his own. &quot;Of course you are forgiven. You could have given in to the evil power but you fought it even though it meant your life. You lived your life with honor my son.
