BEWARE!</span><hr size=1> Ok, about 2 weeks ago two separate members of this guild intentionally trained me because I was camping gnomes in Sol A and they wanted the camp.  Now Phoboz - that's right, he can't think of a name so names himself after Phobose the monk - gets into a big argument with me in HHK.  Seems I had the camp he wanted, and his mommy &amp; daddy told him he could have anything he wanted.  EQ has NO customer service so a petition response was out of the question, and he's a monk &amp; could FD train me, and his guild has a proven track record of intentionally training to get camps.  I had no choice but to share the HHK nobles with him.  Nevermind that I was there first and could easily hold the entire camp as it spawned.  I have to give him credit - he at least warned me ... the rest of his guild just up and trains you to get your camp.  Consider yourselves warned. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.bestweb.net/~buddha/soenerf.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

Second i asked you nicly to see if i could take the nobles or bards since you had them both... i said that if you were willing to give up one of the camps you could chose which one i could have, you said that i could have the nobles. Third You have a bit fit about it once you said that i could have the nobles camp just because you had to give one of them up. Fourth yes i know of the wrong things that 2 of my guildies did to you and they shouldnt have been sitting near the entrance.. they should know that Sol A always has trains no matter how many people in the zone. Fifth Phobose is my older brother you can even ask him if he is on when your on. Sixth you cant blame the whole guild for what happened. Seventh you just dont go harassing people when ever you feel like it. Eighth if you talk about my family again i will report you. Ninth stop calling me the punk you are, your the one acting like a kid i know i did act like a kid at first saying that you should find another game to play and all about you harassing me. Tenth you should keep the argument in tells not in /ooc.... now that is acting childish. that is all i have to say for now until Gurck can grow up and try to act his age. i hope you can realize that you have made your self look like a jerk but i forgive you and im sorry.<br>

We all know that the PnP and Sony don't necessarily agree with the majority of players.  We all know that there is etiquette between the more mature players which doesn't go in line with the PnP.  By insisting on sharing this camp, we each got less exp than we could have gotten in a place like DL or KC, which is sad.  Please, take your own advice.<br>

<br>
&lt;edit&gt; Phoboz I didn't say you trained me - You did not.  Your guild has twice within a week, both intentional, and I didn't need help putting 2 and 2 together to see what would happen if I didn't give in to you.<br>
<br>
&lt;edit&gt;<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Second i asked you nicly to see if i could take the nobles or bards since you had them both... i said that if you were willing to give up one of the camps you could chose which one i could have, you said that i could have the nobles.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Let's not sugarcoat this ok?  Anyone curious should know that I had the camp no problem solo, as it spawned.  If I couldn't handle it with the spawn times that's one thing, but I could.  He came in, upset that I had the camp he wanted and some back &amp; forth happened.  I told Phoboz I had the camp no problem but he wouldn't take no for an answer, telling me that it wasn't fair, that I was greedy, etc etc etc (all the stuff spoiled kids say when they don't get their way) until I realized that he wasn't going to go away and wouldn't hesitate to FD-train me if he didn't get his way.<br>
<br>

They pulled the train on me, then waited at the zone line so they could say that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>I</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> trained <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>them</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> when it was the other way around.. don't try to say this was a mistake, it was very intentional on their part.<br>
<br>
&lt;edit&gt;<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Sixth you cant blame the whole guild for what happened. Seventh you just dont go harassing people when ever you feel like it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'm not blaming the whole guild for you in particular.  I'm blaming the whole guild for three separate incidents involving four separate guild members.  This is more than a &quot;bad apple&quot; thing.  I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>don't</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> go harassing people - your guild does however.<br>
<br>
&lt;edit&gt;<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Eighth if you talk about my family again i will report you<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Calm down, all I asked was if he was 10 like you, or older.  After speaking with Phobose I can say he's a good guy.  He also mentioned that you're young and immature.<br>

Ralph Nader didn't make companies start caring about thier customer treatment by keeping his mouth shut.  I see myself as sort of like him - most people and therefore most guilds, in todays world, will step all over other people for their own benefit.  I see something wrong with this, and unfortunately I'm one of the only ones.  When its blatant like your guild, I will vocalize my complaint so that it may be heard and so that others will be warned. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.bestweb.net/~buddha/soenerf.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

I am not saying that this makes it okay for several members to be causing trains.  I am an officer in the guild, but have not been on lately, and cannot say anything about Phoboz, since I have not dealt with him yet.  I will say that the guild needs to deal with this, but I am afraid I do not think anything will come of it though.  I believe that under current leadership, that nothing will happen.  If we had Freeform back, we would be better off, but he has been MIA for a year now.  Eppie would even be much better at this point, but he is happy with VM.  I hope the guild will learn from this post that not all are happy inside ourranks, but I havestated this before and nothing has been done, so I just wanted to let the server know that it is not the whole guild, just a few members.  The core group of people could be a great guild, but I don't think that is going to happen under current leadership, sorry guys!!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->
