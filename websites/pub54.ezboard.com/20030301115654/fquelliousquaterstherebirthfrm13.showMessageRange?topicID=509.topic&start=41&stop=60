Gaelron, so it is YOUR opinion that if I level up my 2nd warrior to 50+, and my current enjoyment of a Wizzard to 50+ (giving me 4 50+ toons) that I haven't a clue as to what I am doing?<br>
<br>
LOL, you have NO CLUE of the enjoyment I get from playing my toons.  You have NO CONCEPT of the amount of pride I take in how I play my toons.<br>
<br>
I feel sorry for you.  Your view of me being &quot;afraid&quot; to get a toon to 60, is just.... well.. wrong..<br>
<br>
I have gone MORE places with my different toons than most people have ever gone in the game.<br>
<br>
My toons are GEARed to go to different places (IE.. my cleric has an EB item - can go to the grey, My warrior has all resist gear, can leisurely stroll through places like Dalnir).<br>
<br>
You want to know WHY I dont have a toon at level 60 yet?<br>
<br>
I'll volunteer the reason...  Becuase I don't feel feel like sitting in the same old BORING zones grinding out experience JUST to say &quot;Heh, look at me, I'm level 60 and your NOT!&quot;<br>
<br>
Being level 60 does NOTHING for me personally. (who the hell cares if I would have more mana, health, ac, resists, it is a game)  <br>
<br>
Go back to being level 60, hunting in CT, getting all your UBER loot.  Leave me to my experiencing zones in new ways using my different characters.  Loot means nothing to me, when compared to experiencing zones with a new toon.<br>

You don't realize it but you are missing something when you stop short and play another character.. 1-55 is easier than 55 to 60.  Just admit you are taking the easy road cause you don't want to have to work for it.. getting to 60 isnt all grinding.. go solo in grey of group up for a few hours a day.. You don't have to grind 12 hours a day to get to 60..<br>
<br>
Trust me.. you are missing out by stopping at 60.. And it isnt the elitist or the loot or the uber guilds..<br>
<br>
Its the &quot;wow I finally made it&quot; feeling when you ding 60.  All the hard work paided off.<br>
<br>
No need to get hostile.. I'm just saying you are missing out on something which you can't deny cause you haven't experienced it yet.   <p><center>

P.S.  i'd imagine the feeling of getting to lvl 60 get worst after AA skills came out.  I think ppl who rush to 60 would think: Damn, finally make 60..now, need to work on the god damn AA exp.<br>

<br>
You could not be MORE WRONG.  I play ALL my toons actively.<br>
<br>
Ask members of Lor Mani, with whom I still group occassionally.<br>
<br>
Last time I grouped with them, I was on my 51 warr.  The time before that I was on as my cleric.  Prior to that, my 45 warr.<br>
<br>
Mind you, this is all within 4 days.  It is NOT taking an easy road by playing the other toons, it is a break from the monotony  and sometimes I feel like beating the crap out of something, which as a cleric, generally doesn't happen.  Sometimes I feel like blowing stuff up, so I play my wizz...<br>
<br>
Again, you just dont get it.  I play my toons, my way, when I feel like playing them... because THAT gives me the enjoyment i NEED to continue playing the game.<br>
<br>
The instance I start playing a toon because someone ELSE (that matters) tells me I have to, I'll stop playing all together, because THAT DOES NOT give me the enjoyment I find in the game.<br>
<br>
That feeling of reaching 60 actually scares me, why? because then I have 135 (or so) AA point to look forward to getting.  <br>
<br>
In all the time I have played (almost 2 years), I have yet to hear someone say, THANK GOD I HIT 60!! now lets get all those AA points!!<br>
<br>
It's always been.. Finally, I hit 60, great, now to grind and get all those damn AA points...<br>
<br>
THAT is not something I want to look forward to.  <br>
<br>
You also claim that being 60 isn't elitest?.. Heh.. when was the last time you gave the time of day to some level 40 who hadn't a clue about something?  Not anytime recently I'll wager.  But, I dont fault you, most all level 60's do it.  Most of you have your nose so far up in the air, you could walk off a cliff and not realize it.  THAT is what I dont want to look forward to.<br>
<br>
You claim being level 60 isn't about the loot?  Fine, sell me your Fungi for 1k.. I didnt think so.  THAT is what I dont want to look forward to.<br>
<br>
You claim it isn't about &quot;uber&quot; guilds?  Um.. hello, mcfly??  If your not a member of what I call the council of 7, you dont have a pray of getting anything decent, to call your own.<br>
<br>
LC<br>
Wraith<br>

HU<br>

EHL<br>
<br>
(I am sure there are more)<br>
<br>
Hell, you all would rather train, kill and mame each other, JUST to get to specific mobs for their loot first!<br>
<br>
DO NOT deny it, it still happens and we read it here all the time.<br>
<br>
THAT is not what I want to look forward to.<br>
<br>
You see, it has nothing to do with taking an easy road..  It's ALL about what I DONT want to forced to become, the enjoyment I get from playing my way, the way I STILL experience the old zones, but looking at them through different characters.<br>
<br>
I never claimed to KNOW what I am missing by NOT being level 60, but ya know.. from what I see from all my peers, I dont think I am missing much at all.<br>
<br>
I dont play to be UBER, have UBER gear, be in an UBER guild, kill UBER mobs (well, maybe this one)...  I play to have fun, meet people, learn new things or different ways to do them.  THAT is what this game DOES for me..<br>
<br>
Can you say that? honestly?  Something tells me no..<br>
<br>
Your proly too busy gearing up to kill this mob, jumping to kill that mob, pissing and moaning because you missed out on this other mob..

<br>
You and I have known each other for a very long time. Since our days together in Legendary Heroes. You, along with Thundax and Kyrius and Vilu and Oriz and Malla and Xaviertalon (and even Calron) used to make fun of the fact that I didn't level as fast as you guys did. I took it all in stride because I had my reasons for waiting (Strumm was lower than I was and I wanted to stop leveling so he could catch up.) I bounced in and out of level 40 so many times, people got tired of sending me congratulations. &quot;Let me know when you hit 42, Radj, I'll woot then.&quot;<br>
<br>
Getting to 50 was a goal of mine, as that was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> the</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> level to get 'back in the day.' So I have at least accomplished that. Will I ever get to 60? As I said in my first post to this thread, I don't know.<br>
<br>
I know I cannot possibly know what it's like to reach level 60 and play the level 60 game. It's like having children... you cannot imagine what your world would be like until you have them, nor can you imagine, after they are born, living without them.<br>
<br>
At the end of Dungeon Siege, there is a really tough creature at the bottom of a dungeon. [Spoiler incoming] When you kill him, you think you're done but you're not. From his ashes spawns a creature with up to three times the original creature's hit points. &quot;Awesome,&quot; you think as you hack away, &quot;game's not over yet.&quot; When you defeat him, however, the game <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> done. You collect your treasures and then... nothing. No magical portal opens to take you somewhere else. No god-like entity comes to congratulate you. Nothing. You just have to quit the game, or start working your way back through the dungeon, up through the castle and back to town. There's nothing more except to repeat the same maps, collect the same treasure, and fight the same creatures.<br>
<br>
EverQuest isn't like Dungeon Siege. There is no end, for the most part. You can hit level 60 and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> still</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> there are things you haven't seen or places you haven't gone. There is loot you haven't collected. There are creatures you haven't defeated. Except for me. Level 60 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the end.<br>
<br>
So I take my time with Radjan. I play Qyjari and Kerynna and Kaisey and Sansoleil and a host of other characters. I take them to new places - places Radjan's never been before. They kill creatures Radjan's never fought. They learn class-specific things that Radjan will never have the opportunity to learn.<br>
<br>
&quot;...missing something when you stop short and play another character...?&quot;<br>
<br>
Not for me.<br>
<br>

So I fit your example Gaethan.  Do you wonder why none are 60?  I like variety.  I started out the warrior, but i got tired after awhile and made the mage and cleric about the same time.  I got tired of lfging as a melee when there were no healers so i made him.  And i wanted to solo so i made the mage.  Eventually, the warrior was well out in front on lvls he has the most days played at about 75, but i ran into a problem where he needed better gear and well, trying to get gear as a gimp equipped war wasnt gonna work.  The mage is/was my farmer, but i did group some with him as well.  As for the cleric, well, he is the char that got invited to my current guild.  He was 25 at the time and i was the ONLY cleric main(war was in semi retirement at this pt) in the guild from what i  remember.  So i started making the mad dash to exp.  But i got burned out a few times along the way.  This led to playing the other chars.  Eventually i came back to the cleric(only has around 60 days played btw).  <br>
<br>
     A couple of  things.  I believe having a more well rounded group of chars has made me a better player.  I know spells, how they work, my  role, and the roles of those other classes.  I know my weaknesses and strengths.  As  for the &quot;less talented&quot; players out there, when you did group with them and they screwed up, did you try and offer advice or bitch at them(you know this happens)?  I mean im sure most of you(me included) didnt make every step correct.  You didnt know it all at first either maybe you got some help from others.  Maybe if you helped to teach them they wouldnt be so horrible.  As for those who dont listen, well, those are the lost causes, but most people would be willing to learn. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=133654>Kalef Bonemender</a><BR>59 Cleric<BR>Denizens of Shez'Baernon</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwulfgyrdracokyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wulfgyr Dracokyn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.psynical.com/17anidot1b.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Milk sucks... got beer?</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/11/02 5:57:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=50>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.psynical.com/WulfyFace.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The new level 60 rush.......</span><hr size=1> Um....

Who the hell are you and HOW DARE YOU call someone &quot;lazy&quot; because they aren't rushing to 60 (like me for one - I don't see you with any master or grandmaster tradeskills next to your name) or don't intend to do so or not do so for a long time (like Impudent).<br>
If anything, we are ALL lazy - INCLUDING YOU - for spending so much time on a video game instead of out exercizing or getting better jobs or doing our homework.<br>
When being a lvl 60 character in a video game pays the bills you can start calling people lazy for not hitting 60 asap.<br>
Until then, get off the high horse.<br>

Alternate advancement... Back in the early days.. One wanted to get to 50.. then it was 60 and now with AA it does seem like endless work. (im a master of all tradeskills cause of the shawl work btw)  I take a basketball class.. Do my college homework but the job thing has still eluded me =)  Tell me why people get a character all the way to 54 and then stop and start another one.. Its not about variety its about not wanting to put in the work... There are exceptions of course.<br>
<br>
Impudent I see what you are saying but gotta respond to a few things.. <br>
<br>
One.. Elitism? There are elitists out there sure but you sound one every lvl60 is an elitist.  Thats not true of course.. Most people in those uber guilds you mentioned have no time to help others out let alone exp for themselves however I will be willing to answer any questions a person may ask in a tell.. If someone I don't know asks me for help on something no matter what level I would be cautious.<br>
<br>
two.. loot?  Not sure where you are going with this one.. You don'y have to be 60 to get a fungi.. There is greedy people of all levels but just wanting loot doesnt make you greedy nor does selling it cheaply<br>
<br>
Uber guilds? there are plenty of people who are 60 and aren't in uber guilds.. They may not get all the best loot but they have fun with their friends.. Nothing wrong with that.<br>
<br>
That stuff happens but I have NEVER EVER been involved with a guild where they train another guild to get to a specific mob.. Sure we rush or whine when we lose or even call a GM but we never play dirty.<br>
<br>
You can do all the things you love and still be 60 ya know.. You have some serious misconceptions about people who are 60.. Not everyone is like what you discribed.<br>
<br>
There is no law that you have to join a uber guild at 60 or act that way.. There are plenty of people who are under 60 and in uber guilds too.. Its a play style not an upgrade over your current one.<br>
<br>
Radjan you and others are an exception but there are more people who don't want to put in the effort to get to 60 cause they are being lazy than those who want to explore the game from different angles.<br>
<br>
Again I'm not talking about the people who are rushing or want variety... I'm talking about the people who are afraid to reach 60 cause they feel it will change their playstyle or are just too lazy to put in the effort to reach 60.. I say its well worth it to reach 60 whether you want to be in a uber guild or not.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want some evidence.. Verant said they made way too many character slots for everquest and if they had to do it again there would be much less..  They also want people to stick to 1 or 2 characters.  So in EQ2 expect less slots to play with. <p><center>

There is no right way and no wrong way to play this game, that is why so many people stick around.   Saying what you think is the best way to go about things is perfectly fine. Saying that your outlook on the game and then going on to insult (yes, calling people lazy is an insult, no matter how you word it) anyone who disagrees is just plain old shitty. =\<br>

<br>
I consider myself to be one of the more amenable level 60 characters and I will speak with anyone, friends or not.  The only people I dont speak with is those who have made my ignore list.  <br>
<br>
If I am running through a zone and someone is struggling, I will help them.  I have been known to have surplus equipment on my cleric, I give stuff away to /randompeople01.  <br>
<br>
What I do not like is leeches - I can spot em from a mile off.  <br>
<br>
I have 3 50+ characters, I enjoy only playing 2 of them - the other I use for camping.  Why do I have 3 characters 50+ ? well the answer is was for other people. <br>
<br>
Raluvin - my main - I will play him at every opportunity I can get.  work AA with him, lead raids etc.  but he is not versatile at all if I need to travel through dangerous areas.  <br>
<br>
Kala - 57 cleric - it is useful to have a cleric camped out at your fighting spot wherever it may be.  Then the cleric in your group is not inconvienced by re-binding.  In addition to this, DOSG is tank heavy - it does not lack clerics, but because we aint this all powerful guild and more a family type we dont usually have the 15 or so clerics that are in guild.  So I playy Kala. <br>
<br>
Roluvin - 51 monk.  I first made Roluvin for our european QQ outings.  We only had one european monk at the time (Yoza) who really had his/her own agenda.  Because the europeans needed a monk at the time - I made Roluvin and got him to 51 quick sharpish.   Then I helped the europeans....then QQ fizzled and it became FFA.  So Roluvin became redundant.  However,  I can use his versatility to fill in almost any empty monk spot in any area.  I have managed to split the PoZs with him a few times in Kael (but died a fair bit also), I can use him to travel because of FD and his jboots and I can use him to camp absolutely anywhere.  <br>
<br>
In fact, without Roluvin I seriously doubt I would have managed Raluvin's willsapper.  I moved him through DN without invis and sow down to Vaniki's area and found a nice area where only 2 mobs pathed through.  <br>
FD'd<br>
So although people have X amount of characters 50+, it is usually because they get sick of playing their main (happened to me) or they need versatility.....I need versatility.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ubulvaihammersson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BulvaiHammersson</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/12/02 6:41:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=509.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The new level 60 rush.......</span><hr size=1> Ral, you elitist snob! Always running around, organizing raids for the 51+ crowd (Wait, did I say 51? You mean Ral doesn't exclusively raid with 60's?). Always worrying about exp on raids (Course he's not usually in the KS group even when he's setting up groups, so that means he's worrying about other people's exp). And with all those high level toons (Any of which are played as needed even if he's not happy with the role). Oh, and such a guild elitist too! I actually saw DoSG people at the last raid I attended with Ral, and they even got loot! (Ignore the fact that he argues heavily for guests to have the right to roll even though they are unguilded because they still contribute to the raid).<br>
<br>
What a selfish bum.<br>
<br>
(For those absolutely blind and stupid, the comments above, not in parenthese, are sarcasm. For Fkin-types, it means they were a tricky joke)<br>
<br>
Bulvai is (theoretically) my main. He's a mighty 52nd level and as of this month, has been around for three years, real time (Birthdate was Sept, 99, on the 1st I think). I've got around 75 days played on him. Took a break of about a year a little while back. I'm in no rush to get Bul to 60. Why? Because I don't care. <br>
<br>
I play EQ purely for entertainment. Level don't mean jack, loot means less, and AAexp is a crock. All that matters to me is enjoying the game enough to justify the $13/month I spend on it. It ain't hard to squeeze $13 outta EQ. Looking at it this way also means that I don't stress over EQ like a WHOLE LOTTA folks. Been a long while since EQ pissed me off, and it was because someone was an absolute jackass to me personally. Loot, exp, camps, raids, and all that is pointless if it ain't fun, and it can't be fun if I'm stressing over levelling. <br>
<br>
So Bulvai meanders along. I only play him when my wife isn't on. I'd much rather play my halfling warrior (36th as of last night, with a birth date w/in 2 weeks of Bulvai's) alongside her halfling druid. Now that's fun. Metric, my warrior, may even reach a higher level than Bulvai someday. Depends on how things go. If he does, I won't even bat an eye, because it don't matter to me, and no one else's opinion of my levels/toons means a damned thing either.<br>
<br>
EQ is a game. Games are fun. Thus EQ should be fun. <br>
<br>

I think some clarification or reiteration is in order.<br>
<br>
NEVER did I say &quot;all level 60's are snobs&quot;... I said &quot;MOST all...&quot;<br>
<br>
Big difference.<br>
<br>
(need an example?... the other day in nexus.. WATCHING 4 lvl 60 druids on port in pad, 2 porting for donations (boggle).. I shout donating for a sow.. 10 minutes and a few shouts later.. still shouting.. so I left)  [And dont think for a minute they'll ever get a rez, albeit 90%, from me]<br>
<br>
Your right being specific levels should not force me to change my play style, but the zones dictate that I MUST, or be utterly crushed.<br>
<br>
Without trying to sound like more of an ass... why do you think I am unguilded?  Majority of the reason is that I prefer to go out and do things as I see fit and only have to worry about myself, not protecting the image of a guild, where any number of OTHER players can screw up a reputation.<br>
<br>
Many people know my toons.  MOST of them have a very good impression of me, and I worked hard for it.  WHY chance changing that impression if someone has a bad day?<br>
<br>
(example.. in a group last night wth my wiz.. Great group.. exp jumping along.. al of a sudden a member leaves because he realizes another group member was a member of LC.  Further stated that LC KS'd a golem or something (no clue)..  But, this is an example of reputation AND &quot;leap-frogging&quot; tactics that the big-boys use...

I think &quot;not wanting to put in the time&quot; to get to lvl 60 is a pile of crap.  Last I checked this was a game and before I actually got to lvl 60 I was doing exactly what Imp was doing.  I have tons of characters in the 20s 30s 40s 50s.  Why?  Because I get bored easily and want to explore new classes.  Lvl 60 didn't mean jack to me when I hit it.  I didn't get lvl 60 because I wanted to &quot;finish&quot; what I started.  I got lvl 60 because it was that character's turn to be explored.  Boredom just happened to be my rogue's friend at the time.<br>
<br>
Imp, just keep on plugging away and having fun with the game.  That's what you bought the game for isn't it?<br>
<br>
Oh and the comment about the lvl 60s being snobs....you're right, i'm a stuck up pompous loot whoring shite talking PoS.<br>

Many of you are sitting there saying, &quot;why the hell is he so happy with that piece of crap gear?&quot;... But not me, it has helped revive my interest in playing my warrior more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The reason I am happy with it?  Because I not only helped someone kill Rage for epic, I had fun doing it.. and got lucky on a roll for IT.  (yes, it was rolled for first, but I wanted IT more than a Dragon Bag)<br>
<br>
So what if it's 100% WR and only .4 weight... I can shoot FLAME BOLTS!!!  If I was worried about WR, I'd go do the Rallic Pack quest.. for a 8th time...<br>
<br>
how often do you see warriors shooting flame bolts?... Aside from me.. I have yet to see it!! :P<br>
<br>
THAT is why I play <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804>Impudent Blasphemy</a><BR>
