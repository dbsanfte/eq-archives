<br>
Is it this version:<br>
Are they agreeing with Verbo that he ran through the full temple, the 10 HT mobs ,with others to get the shissar.  Pull the shissar out FD to split it. brought the shissar home clean. THEN tristadorn collected up all the temple mobs that had been pathing home after Verbos FD, and having purposely collecting them up trained ADD with them?<br>
<br>
<br>
Or is it this version:<br>
Tristadorn ran trough the temple area clearing out as many temple mobs as he could so the shissar would be free and clear (as its indifferent) (we add ead cleared out a few too).  And then Bippity ran up gained agro ran away. Verbo ran up gained agro pulled it off single to ADD.  Then hearing that Verbo had pulled the shissar that he deliberatly agrod all those temple mobs to clear up he brought the temple mobs to you when he came your way to get our damn shissar?<br>
<br>
Which  version?  Look bro there is still  mulitple speculation version coming out of ADD and there has always been just one version coming out of us.  the bottom.  you want to run with the first its bunk. theres nothing to talk about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufeadornlifegiver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feadorn Lifegiver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/15/02 11:20:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=242>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:  Character Analysis.........</span><hr size=1> Qutsemnie, dude, Radiant hasnt gotten their story straight either.

Not what has been said (i havent bothered reading it)<br>
<br>
I logged on and ADD was mostly in Feerott. I asked what was happening and was told we were going after Shissar. I port over, arriving at the portal a few mins late, so everyone had just zoned in and made their way to camp. (i forget which one, directly left as u zone into fear)<br>
<br>
I zone in and train a mob (one mob) to camp, which joins another 3 already there which we Area Effect.<br>
<br>
We then pull another 5 or so, AE them.<br>
<br>
Then Verbo says over guild chat that Shissar is Inc. Its arrives and we start attacking it.<br>
<br>
I then see Tristadorn on his horse with several Turmoil Toads and a few other mobs next to me.<br>
<br>
I get attacked by a toad, everyone is concentrating on Shissar. I die pretty quick, i might have had more mobs on me, i dont know, but even with Aegol and epic and only getting hit for 150 tops i still died quick, so i think there was more than one.<br>
<br>
I arrive at my bind point, ADD are still trying to deal with these mobs. But eventually succumb and we wipe out. <br>
Verbo uses some stick to res a cleric, who resses some others.<br>
Qindien loots the shissar.<br>
<br>
Verbo then gets trained again and the few that were ressed gets wiped out except a cleric that managed to camp (think it was Weel)<br>
<br>
He logs back in, resses Verbo who kites the mobs around while we res everyone.<br>
<br>
I then evaced out.<br>
<br>
I saw Tristadorn in our camp the first time with mobs all around him. Maybe he didnt train.. maybe he was just watching us all die. I seriously doubt that.<br>
<br>
This is my view on what happened. I have not changed a thing, this is what i saw and what i did.<br>
<br>
I can once again say sorry for what happened. I dont like having to be so competetive for mobs. However, ADD have to be or we get walked over. We have had so many mobs taken from us with the same rules we now use. We use these rules because if we just let it happen, we'd accomplish nothing. Quote all the posts i have in Graffe if u want, it means the same thing. <br>
<br>
We've had LC storm past us in Hate AEing their way to the Mage Epic that we were making our way to.<br>
<br>
We've had countless guilds take Ragefire from us either on rolls (Radiant), failed attempts (SoTU), decievement (Radiant) ((is that a word?!). Shakaee wasnt there the whole time for her rage camp, cus i remember popping by to see Grimsoar camping it and he was the only one in Skyfire (im english so am up when others are asleep).<br>
<br>
We dont flame when things like this happen. We simply pick ourselves up, curse a bit in guildchat, and think of ways that we can not let it happen again. And we use the rules VI enforced on us when we lost these spawns when we go to try it again. If we didnt,we'd get no spawns, then the next time we get it, someone can easily use those rules again against us, and there is nothing we can do about it. We have to accept these rules when any other guild comes along and wants the spawn. If everyone stops it, im sure we will, but like i keep on saying and have showed in my examples, we do get screwed, and until guilds stop screwing us, we will continue to get mobs any 'VI Legally' way that is possible.<br>
<br>
I believe im a pretty nice guy. I havent had anyone tell me otherwise and as far as im aware have no enemies. Im still very pissed off at Radiant for taking two Ragefire's off Grimsoar. Not so much the first one (both camped it for what seems like the same amount of time, according to Radiants story on Shakaee and my accounts on Grimsoar). The second one, Grim was told he could have the camp, so decided to buff the raid up a bit to lower the casulties. And while he was doing that Radiant pulled Rage and killed him (i was there and thats what Grim said). <br>
<br>
Im suprised how much people believe Tristadorn. And how without any proof they seem to come to his aid. People seem to forget all the crap he did in the past.<br>
<br>
Yet ADD is constantly getting bashed on this board. For doing exactly the same things as most other guilds do on rare spawns.<br>
<br>
Im running out of writing steam now, and ive forgotten what i said at the start of my post. <br>
<br>
I find it amusing how people can tell me and my guild to go to hell, but still ask for a port though!<br>
<br>
Good day to you all, hope to see you in game on better circumstances. Well, some of you.<br>

Secondly, if ADD had a spotter in Fear well then by golly they must have that neat little GM trick of not showing up in the who list! This is a bold faced lie. There were no ADD people in Fear until 4pm, either anon, roleplay or otherwise.<br>

Also, I noticed that all hits besides Bippity's were missing. Was Verbo pulling it back when Bippity hit it? I don't know. I wasn't there. Trist, maybe you and Bippy need to get together before you start spouting out lies of your own. <br>

While we were in fear neo came to fear.  WHILE WE WERE IN FEAR neo came to fear.   IMPLYING that sometime before neo came we were there alone...  We entered fear no neo.   We set up in north camp theres NEO.  Trist wasnt lying.  There was no spotter when we entered fear.  I mean sometime after there was a spotter. HELL sometime after we were in fear there were LOTS of ADD. if your going to say its a contradiction you need to deal with the 4pm thing. What does bipps log say about an ADD member not being fear until 4pm?  Btw im first hand knowledge here cause i was the one that told fretta to add neo to our group OUR _group_ in the north camp added YOUR _spotter_... you officially have an excuse. there wasnt enough of you (14 in zone at shissar pull). you stalled us...  but in the end we added your spotter to our group in north camp now your even claiming that by implying bipps log is true to contradict trist?<br>
<br>
But you claimed multiple contradictions didnt you?  i mean more then one?  where is the other?  atleast two... yar?<br>

<br>
I posted over a page ago trying to get this to end.. but some people always have to get in the last word.  That being said, I am going to be just as bad, as i feel compelled to make a few last remarks before we wrap this up.<br>
<br>
First of all, those of you accusing Tristadorn of training are both ignorant of his character and ignorant of plane of fear tactics.  I didn't know Trist way back when, but i have known him for almost a year, and in that time he has been nothing but an upstanding individual and a very capable leader.  As for him training you in fear, I think it very unlikely that he did in intentionally if at all.  When pulling the temple in fear, we usually kite around the area between the portal and the temple.  I can tell you that if anyone comes closer to the train then Trist is, all the train will turn on him (i tag him all the time, this is the way the aggro works in fear).  If Verbo ran past Trist as Trist pulled the temple, right there he is on the aggro list of all the temple mobs.  If at any time during his kiting Trist was further away from the mobs than Verbo.. that is where the train came from.  My point being - you can't expect to run into the temple in fear, pull Wraith of a Shissar, and make it back to camp WITH NO AGGRO.  It doesn't happen.  I'm sure Verbo is very skilled, but the fact is, his hasty pull is what caused ADD to be trained.  I'm sure he thought it was worth it, too.  But then to come here and try to blame Trist for that is a pretty ridiculous thing imo.<br>
<br>
As for the ragefire incidents.. in Shaekee's there was not even any gray. we were 100% in the right.  In Caladur's Rage... I was the officer in command.  i pulled Rage.  the complaint from Grimsoar is that he received tells saying we were standing down.  I sent no such tells, nor was i aware of any such tells being sent.  i apologize if that caused any bad feelings or misperceptions about myself, but i would not have used deception to try to get the edge on you.  as i had made clear in a tell to Blal earlier - it was a race, and if they had the force i expected them to pull (and wished them luck).  we would do the same if i felt we had force to kill the dragon.  i ordered rage to be pulled, and my 3 groups killed it.  i apologize if anyone has bad feelings about that event.<br>
<br>
i hope our two guilds can co-exist better in the future. if there is one thing i have learned from this, it's that you can never communicate too much with the other guild in a situation like fear on thursday.  i'm sure if we had talked more the result would have been better <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Qindien is giveing the piece to Maeve not because he has to but because he is a good person and feels this is right...<br>

What more do you want..Do you want us to disband Verbo would that make you feel better. Guess what it is not gonna happen...For whatever you feel about Verbo he is our Monk and whatever flaws you feel he has well they are our flaws to deal with not yours...<br>
<br>
 As for the post that Raluvin made../HUGS HUGS HUGS<br>
You said everything about my hubby that I couldn't put into words...<br>
<br>
I would like to say one thing about the day in HOT..You are right a memeber of our guild did train you a couple of times..IT was that persons first time there and the death to their character rattled them and they were unsure of what to do...BUT I WOULD like to point out...I gated out and left our raid to come and raise your an apologized for this and I aalso put a stop to it as soon as I figured out who was doing it and why...But I guess the fact that I came and rezzed without being asked was forgettable...WE are not perfect but as long as I have been in ADD I can say if I ever known we trained anyone I ahve tried to make it right..So if you wanna bash us at least make sure you add the part that we tried to fix this too...<br>

Exactly ... thats what started this entire thing. had yall waited and let reliant take a crack at it and then killed the Wraith after they failed i doubt there would have been a flame this big. (im not sayin no flame you can get flamed for anything just not one this Huge or valid)<br>
<br>
Q i have no problems with you personaly i do belive that i have replaced you in groups b4 all of which were well buffed and chanter friendly so dont take my flame as a personal attack you are the only one i have seen so far that is Actually standing up and saying ok maybe we were wrong heres what i am goning to do to fix it, rather than sayin we won screw you. <br>
<br>
as to the other things i posted  i only post facts .. as you saw when i mentioned the Yael thing .. we raced you won and whiped we moved in and got kill then resed your people.&lt;no problems here still respected your guild&gt;<br>
<br>
your people DID open the door in hot repetedly when we were fighting other mobs. &lt; i was pissed at the time but was willing to let it go&gt;<br>
<br>
your people did tell us good luck and then pull sev out from under us. &lt; id like to get mad at you for this but you pulled first it is a contesed spawn you won congrats&gt;<br>
<br>
your people did enter fear with the intent to &quot;take' this mob from another enchanter. thats just not right. its just as rude to walk up on some druid camping halv in sfm and ask him to share everyother spawn. sure you can but you would be a jerk for askin cause its just gona waist both peoples time.  <br>
<br>
this could have been avoided had the guilds involved just agreed to roll from the begining. Yet another attack of the Blue Falcon.<br>

You said it is rude to just walk into a plane and take a mob from another ench. I agree totally ... i would never have done it if i wasnt deceived, been issued false promises and generaly been shitted on with what i feel was the sole purpose to delay ADD to go into the plane first. As qindien said while i was negotiating with trist and he was going what i understood as stalling they suicided into pof with insufficient force only so Trist could say later we went in first we dont want agreement anymore. Later he agreed well wait for GMs decision on it ... while i waited for GM to respond he went ahead and tried to get the mob anyway regardless of his own proposal to which i agreed. When i asked guild to go in and kill the mob my plan was not to kill it and have Qin loot but rather to kill it and force that agreement i was promised. Only when i heard reports of Tristadorn training camp and ppl saying its gonna be a wipeout i told Qin to loot it. Was i nice? Personally i think i was nicer than Tristadorn in this. Was i fair? I tried to be but was screwed at every turn. In the end it all columinated in qindien looting the piece still by verants rules bo not really in what would be considered nice manner ... because of that he offered to give the piece to Maeve if they did not get the piece untill tuesday. He got full officer support for that and i think that was a BIG gesture. He even went to PoF with Radiant to help camp shissar. But guess what ... im told next day that if shissar pops that day they wont give the head to Maeve but instead just use Qins niceness and try to get 2 pieces out of it (rumor not necessarily true but worth a mention). Bottom line as you said Kroud .. had Tristadorn agreed at any point during the entire fiasco (about 20-30 min prior to Radiant entering the PoF up to the point when he allegedly trained us) to ANY of my proposals or simply have stuck to what he himself proposed and i agreed on nothing of this would have happened.<br>
<br>
Lack of comunication is what causes most of crap on this server. When there is competition for a mob always have one person from one party and one person from another party discuss it. Just someone sending tells to random ppl in other party doesnt achieve @#%$ if they dont have the executive power to back up what they promised. As was said  ... when rage was pulled the leader of opposing force didnt know that Grim got tells promising him first try. The tells were obviously sent by someone who wasnt in charge and had no place to talk about it with Grim. Hence the misunderstanding and bad blood between the guilds.<br>
<br>
I wasnt there so i cant give accurate description but same thing could have happened with Sev .. i dont know who /oocd the good luck for your guild there but i suspect it was random guildie #004 who had absolutely no insight in raid leaders thoughts or had any knowledge of the comunication between the 2 raid leaders if there even was any.<br>
<br>
As for yael thing ... as you yourself said it was a competition to which we agreed ... you beat us fair and square after we messed up and pulled yael while oom hhe. Problem is that several of your guildies attacked me for a liar for saying exactly what you said. Its all in perception and the level of information you posess. They were not informed well and they almost made me look a liar with nothing more than relaying flawed perceptions of something they had no idea about. Even on the points on which they had 1st hand information which is very plain to see they couldnt agree (time of arrival and size of respective forces). <br>
<br>
Im not trying to bash anyone im just trying to point out that if ur not 100.1% SURE dont post or post simple facts. Notice that i didnt ever say in my posts that tristadorn DID train us .. i actually dont know that for a fact .. i simply said my guildies reported him training us. That is huge jump in discussion ethics ... while i simply state facts there are many people here who have posted with the intent to force their perceprion of events on other people (so they would not even try to form their own opinion) even though they cannot possibly posess the information relevant and needed to describe the happenings. Sadly as is populistic gossip is read more willingly because it doesnt charge the reader with the effort of forming his/her own opinion over the matter and can rather lazily accept for granted what someone else says and what coicides most approprietly with what the reader is feeling at the moment (mother pissed him off 2 hours ago about something he perceived unjust so he is far more inclied to beleive ADD is @#%$ especially there are people stating yes ADD IS @#%$ while i only post dry and boring facts which wouldnt make good movie material).<br>
<br>
As for the HoT training ... i wasnt there again but i aknowledge it did happen. I find it foolish to beleive we would have done it on purpose though. For every action everyone needs a motive and there was no possible motive there. If our force went into the hall away from zone we had no contact to door camp nor did they inhibit us in any way nor we them. When train/door opening happened it must have been an accident or some inexperience coupled with uncertainty of what to do sprinkled on top with panic. We are not accomplished raiders in ADD. We are not even what a person would call a raiding guild. We have many people that are still to low to be allowed in HoT or some other higher level raids with us and when they are allowed for the first time they are like infants at that particular task. Mistakes happen and we are all sorry for that ... i have no idea why everyone assumes the worst even in spite of common sense.<br>
<br>
Well the moral of the story would be communication is the key ... always have ONE person talking to ONE person and dont do anythig untill those two are done talking. Even when those two people are trying to reach an agreement it isnt civil nor diplomatic to go ahead and try to do what is still being discussed. Once something is agreed stick to it no matter what or reach another agreement with same person before you change your course of action.<br>
<br>
Well in my characteristic post when i have something to say (LONG) i hope tossed out some food for thought at least for those of you who do your own thinking and i hope those who do the thinking are the shepherds not the sheep.
