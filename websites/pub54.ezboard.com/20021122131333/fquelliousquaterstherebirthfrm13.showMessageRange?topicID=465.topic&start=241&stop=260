Let me add for the record that I like the idea of being fair to people and wouldnt mind a list as described above - because its much more fair than a stupid 9 month list.<br>

I was because I stood up for the unguilded folks and those that did not know about it when it got started up, even though I was in LC. Unfortunatly do to some bad apples abusing the system it failed.<br>
<br>
The one thing I have learned from this is that any system will fail. That is because people are human and you can not get 100% agreement. Eventually 1 person will come alog and sit down beside the cleric caming rage fire. When that person gets ragefire he will claim the camp over the next person on the list, if he had been camping ragefire before the next person on the list gets there then no one can say that he is trying to Gank, KS or leap frog. I personaly would not hold it against anyone who did this to me on my Druid epic, before fay was a trigger, or on my Beast epic, not like alot of people wanted it, and I do not believe LC would hold it against him, if he is able to get the force there to kill ragefire and take it first. (NOTE: I DO NOT SPEAK FOR LC, ONLY MYSELF). This will cause other people to complain and claim he is KSing it. It will also cause people to really try to KS it from him, even if he has the first capable force. If he is not able to get the force there, and engages after it is engaged I can not speak what will happen, just that I would not condone it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly this will happen no matter how long the list is. The short random list it will be someone that loses the roll a few times. On the perminate list it will be someone that either dont think the list is fair, or that does not like the fact he has to wait X number of months to get his peice.<br>
<br>
The sad fact is that no one is entitled to their epic, per VI themselves, not me, as no one is entitled to have every time they want. What is the chances of a level one that starts today to have something out of VT before EQ2 comes out.<br>
<br>
There is no solution to this situation, in this I think I have the advatage of seeing first hand over most people here. the best solution is to keep working with other people, be it on a list or just a regular camp until the crap happen. After it does attempt to go back to working with the others.<br>

The list hasn't made the Ragefire more pleasant in terms of sitting in Skyfire for weeks, but has at least given people a shot at it.<br>
<br>
That's what I was trying to point out that some people have this mistaken idea that clerics on the list don't sit there camping/protecting their claim to Ragefire.<br>
<br>
When this list started it was rather unofficial.  There were no written posts listing the clerics but there was a list.  I remember when Crystil got her epic.  She was 3rd on the unofficial list.  And started camping Ragefire on and off for the first week, then camped it with Miina (cleric before her).  Then camped Ragefire for herself.  I know after Crystil there were 2 maybe 3 clerics.  After Crystil was Patche and he was in the zone throughout Crystil's camping for Ragefire.<br>
<br>
I'm a cynic at heart.  I don't really believe that the list will last nor that some guild with enough people wouldn't try to KS the spawn.  Will this cause hard feeling?  Of course it will.  To say otherwise is ignoring human nature.  Is it justified? That's a much harder question.<br>

It's not going to be solved by a list. And it's not going to be solved by taking the list, dividing it by pi, and randoming 300-1000 the people on there. <br>
<br>
In my opinion, the solution is going to be to email Verant and ask them to change the rage spawn to be more like Faydedar. Every day, we should take a minute to compose a few simple sentences and rattle it off on the dev boards, and to Absor. Everyone should do this. This isn't a list problem, and this isn't a cleric problem, as others claim (when asking everyone else to fuck off, which amuses me - never saw 35 clerics kill rage by themselves). This is something that effects each and every one of us at some point playing the game to an extent. <br>
<br>
I am well aware they said they would never change the camp, but there are an awful lot of things as of recent that they said they would never change, and have. Adding soulbinders, graveyards to planar zones, keeping equipment when you die pre-10, adding luclin ports, changing the bard epic... this is a dev team that as of late has shown a commitment to making the game more fun and less of a pain in the ass. We could posture and rattle sabers and flame and swear, or we could calmly... ALL... work together on a solution.<br>
<br>
There 1463 registered users on this board. Thats a lot of email to get, every day. If we can generate 15 pages of pointless bickering, surely we can compose a few sentences every day?  <p><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22703"

Like Thaylin, Gurunt, and others - my time on that committee proved to me that every and any system formed outside of Verant will fail. <br>
<br>
I like what list does (allow clerics from all types of guilds a shot at getting rage), but I don’t necessarily like the list. There are no checks and balances and I don’t think there every will be. Let’s go over some possible scenarios to fix the list and how there is no clear solution to the various problems.<br>
<br>
When should a cleric be allowed on the list? Should they only be allowed on once they have completed all over steps? How do you prove it? Someone can always lie about how far along they are.<br>
<br>
How many rez sticks does a guild need? I don’t think anyone will deny the impact of having one rez stick cleric can have on a guild. It’s huge. But where is the point of diminishing returns? How many rez stick clerics does a guild really need? While I might think anything higher than 4 is overkill, I’m sure someone else will argue you can never have enough rez sticks.<br>
<br>
Should spots on the list be determined on a guild basis rather than on an individual basis? Let’s say we come up with some interesting formula where based on the number of members and clerics, a guild gets X spots on the list. That’s fine until people start forming dummy guilds just so they can reserve more spots on the list. And what about unguilded clerics? We can’t prejudice against them, so they get a spot on the list too. That’s when you notice the surge of unguilded cleric twinks asking to join the list<br>
<br>
Is random better than a list order? Does rolling for a spot on the list really make it better? What’s to stop someone from saying “screw you guys, I’m here first, I’ve got a force ready. You want to random? Thne petition a GM”?  Someone will always feel more entitled than others. Random 3x level? Minus 20 if you’re a twink? Minus 50 if your guild already has a rez stick? Plus 70 if your are old skool?<br>
<br>
Call me a cynic or a pessimist, but I saw all those things happen with the old QQ reservation system. In fact, I became quite skilled at catching those that “cheated” the system. You wouldn’t believe some of the stuff people posted on public message boards.<br>
<br>
If I were the list people, I’d stop calling it a list and start calling it the Ragefire Alliance. Because in the end, that’s the only way to combat pro-FFA is to become FFA yourself. Because if everyone in support of the list, er I mean Reagefire Alliance, joins together then I’m sure they’ll manage to get a fair share of the Ragefire spawns – and do it fairly without ever breaking a single Verant rule. The anti-list people will be happy because FFA is still in place and they will get a shot at Ragefire. Small guilds and others pro-list people will be happy because they will still have support system in place to help them get a shot at Rage. I’m not saying there won’t be drama, Ksing, or other crap – there’s not a damn thing that will ever stop that from happening.<br>
<br>
And if by some obscure chance someone from Verant stumbles across this thread. Allow me to say “WAKE THE HELL UP!” So you are happy with the amount of rez sticks flowing into servers? Are you also happy without the amount of BS and drama you have created on each and every server? You do realize that by calling Everquest a game, it implies that one is to draw enjoyment from it? Make Ragefire just like Fay and let every damn person that wants a f’n rez stick get it without going through this crap. Not only will your player-base love you for it, but also your customer service staff would probably be happy as hell. I’d love to know how time is spent responding and handling Ragefire petitions compared to other spawns. <br>
<br>
Well, I’m finished rehashing points that have already been made by others. Time for this punksmasher warrior to shut up now.<br>

I'm not even gonna bother reading this thread, cause it'll obvious be the same old crap.  Let's cut through the BS and get to the meat of the issues.<br>
<br>
#1 - The current cleric system is NOT in ANY WAY like the old reservation system.  Why? The old system, you were scheduled for a few days as a Raid... not an individual, and then your were slapped around with so many rules and regulations that couldnt possibly apply to everyone.  Remember why LC, Vis, etc went FFA?  Mainly cause they werent allowed by the system to just go in and kill the 1-2 mobs they wanted, and also cause of the blacklisting, etc.  Well... this new system applies to EVERY cleric.  Why?  Simple.... cause they all need Rage.<br>
<br>
#2 - If you dont think it's fair, then draft up and implement a better plan.  But guess what?  You wont, cause you cant.  You cant do better.  Simple.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, there is a list enforced by the powers that be... ie the clerics.  The run their own system, and it's the best system I've seen since I've started EQ.  They run it as fair as possible (and if you dont believe it's fair... then tell me how Fucktards like Prizmo and Mlain can get on it), and they enforce it.  As it stands now, the cleric alliance (for lack of a better term) is a stronger and quicker mobilizing force than any singular guild.  They back their hard work with strength, and THAT's where the success lies.  The old QQ2 system was doomed to failure, cause they couldnt enforce it.  The clerics can, and are enforcing Rage.<br>
<br>
People whine the Quellious is FFA, and why is that?  I'll tell you why... cause Vis, LC, etc decided that it was FFA.  And who are they?  I'll tell you that too.  They are the people with the power to enforce their decisions.  Well now... the clerics just showed up with a bigger force, and THEY are taking charge and making the policy when it comes to Rage.  Get over it.<br>
<br>
But the list is 20+ long now.<br>
<br>
So what, STFU, get over it, and Have A Nice Day.<br>
<br>
As it stood before the list, many cleric had ZERO shot at Rage.  ZERO.  People who are whining that the list is over 6 months long now are most the same people that would be waiting 2+ years without the list to get them their mob.  Also, sorry... but epics go to those that earn them.  Verant has stated time and again that Epic arent a &quot;right&quot;, they are earned only by the most dedicated.  Not everyone is supposed to have an epic.  So if Joe Cleric has to wait wait 6 months, and then spend every day in Skyfire for 3-5 weeks prior to his/her turn, then why should anyone be exempt?<br>
<br>
Answer: They shouldnt.<br>
<br>
If you cant put in the time and dedication, then step the hell aside and let those who can get their epic... cause they deserve it, not you.<br>
<br>
Again, Have A Nice Day.<br>
<br>
But....<br>
<br>
No buts, STFU... cause I'm tired of hearing you whining.  I sat there and watched Syllie camp Ragefire every day for 5+ weeks.  She works 40 hours a week, and isnt some damn kid that has no life outside of EQ.  She's a mother of 3, and a hard worker.  Yet she put in her time.  She sat there and supported the people before her, and made arrangements to have her toon logged on 24/7 when her time came.  As a guild, we rotated shifts logging her in.<br>
<br>
Dedication, pure and simple.<br>
<br>
And to that person who logged into the cleric chat, only to get verbally abused... WTF did you expect, you inconsiderate jackass?  The clerics on Cleric Hill have been there day and night for weeks maintaining their vigil.  And you come along to spout off crap?  How did you EXPECT them to react?  They put in their time, why dont you?<br>
<br>
And Desi, seeing it as how you bought (or were given) yer clicker, maybe it is for the best that you shut up and quit posting.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

<br>
1.  No system, no matter how much time, effort, and thought is put into it will be perfect.  Nor, will it be respected by <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   EVERYONE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  The only way a system of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   ANY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> kind will work, is if it is implemented by Verant and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   ENFORCED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> by Verant.<br>
<br>
2.  Although it is admirable of the clerics at large to have come up with a system of sorts, to avoid an all out battle over the singlemost greatest mob of contention server-wide, it is not only doomed to failure, but it is irrevocably flawed in that it is impossible to inform every single cleric on the server that a list is going to be made.  Because of this, it is unfair to those that heard about the list some 2-3 months after it was implemented, and now have to wait 6-9 months to achieve their epic, when if they had known about the list when it was first made, they might have gotten it already.<br>
<br>
3.  For anyone to presume that one cleric deserves their epic over another is sheer folly.  The only entity with the authority to arbitrarily state who should get his/her epic is Verant themselves, as they are the ones who own the product.<br>
<br>
4.  It is only a matter of time, before some cleric in a guild that has 4-5 burners, or enough folks to just waltz in and smack him down, jumps the line and KS's Ragefire.  Once this is done, we will see how strong this list system really is, if it collapses and Ragefire once again returns to the FFA system.<br>
<br>
4.  If I was in a position of authority to dictate terms over the Cleric Epic Quest, not only would I make Ragefire triggered, like Faydedar for the Druid Epic, but I would make it so that the quest NPC only spawns once every 3 days, or at a server reset.  I would also make it so that the quest is linear, so that in order to spawn Ragefire, you have to have completed ALL STEPS up to this point in the qeust.  In addition, because the effect is a level 56 spell, I would put a level restriction of Level 56 on the Epic.  But, I am not in a position of authority to make this happen, so what we have left is a quagmire of contention over the Ragefire spawn.<br>
<br>
5.  Don't ever think that Verant didn't know exactly what they were doing by making the cleric epic the way it is.  This is their check/balance for limiting the amount of Cleric Epic's entering the game world.  The Cleric Epic is the singlemost game-changing item any guild can possess.  The downtime reduction due to this item is enormous, and Verant knows this.  As a result, they want to limit the number of them that enter the world, so that the content they put out, gets eaten up in a reasonable time.  If it were as easy as the Druid Epic to acheive, there would be no need for a cleric to even have a Level 56 Revivescence Spell, because every single cleric would have their epic once they hit level 51.<br>
<br>
6.  In conclusion, I would like to state that my room-mate plays a cleric as a main.  He is level 59, and has never belonged to a guild.  His avatar is named Rhaize.  He has no aspirations of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   EVER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> achieving his epic, due to the fact that he does not want to be in a guild, nor does he like camping for anything.  There is only one system that would really befit his chances for getting the cleric epic, and it is the list that is currently in place.  I am a proponent of this system, but I don't think it will last.  There are far too many assholes on this server that will find some way to fuck it up for everyone that is civil, patient and willing to wait their turn. <p><center><a target="new"href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30880">Rhes Olooshun - 59th Preserver</a></center>

I'm still waiting for someone to come up with a better idea. Until then, I support the list. It just WORKS. If a better idea rolls along, by all means - make this better. This camp SUCKS. I am ALL FOR improvement. I think the only better idea possible is flooding VI with so much email that something gets done. They've changed things in spite of their statements before; nothing says it won't happen again. But, it has to be &quot;earned&quot;...i.e. the customers have to speak up and keep speaking up until they are responded to.<br>

Yes, in spite of &quot;The List&quot; (TM), NOTHING is saying that a faster mobilizing raid can't snatch someone's Rage. However, due to the fact that very large amounts of people are deployed the moment he spawns, I don't give much for their chances. How is that different from any other contested mobs now? AoW? KT? (If you've EVER been in Kael when the server crashed you know where I am coming from.) Hell there are even a few guilds duking it out on Ssrae...first there with power will always get the mob. You don't hear anyone else bitching. The Clerics of Quellious HAVE that power now, and I am happy to see a means of success built on the dedication of this large a part of the server. <br>

Amen. As a member of one of Quellious's smaller guilds, THIS is why I appreciate the list so much. It gives those from guilds like mine a chance at their epics. Just because someone is in a SMALLER guild, doesn't mean they deserve their epic less than someone from a guild that kills high level crap all the time. Guess what?!? Without a list, all small guilds would be left out in the cold, which I think is bullshit. Dedication, not guild tag, should determine who gets their epic. At least this way they have a chance, and many are HAPPY to wait 4-6 months for their turn...because they know they WILL get a turn.<br>

I was in cleric chat during the tail end of that. While I do NOT know the person personally who was getting verbally thrashed, I don't think people were right to rip her to shreds over this. Like my first reply in this post, I am waiting for someone to come up with a better idea. Just because someone's idea is not an improvement, doesn't mean you gotta give them hell for it. The ultimate goal is the same - trying to make the Rage experience easier for clerics. Just my 2cp.<br>

<br>
Exactly. I must be &quot;out of the loop&quot;, as it were, because you know what? In the cleric channel no one called either of these guys assholes, and people still rallied to help kill Rage when he popped for Mlain. Granted, it does NOT mean they are not (charging groupmates for rezzes is the biggest wad of BS I think I've ever heard, and if it's true, the guy is on my BS list for life), HOWEVER, it is a perfect example that the list does not cater only to one class of cleric. I don't begrudge either person their turn on the list. They had to help the clerics before them, they did their time. The list FORCES people to help each other out. If you HATE the cleric ahead of you on the list, tough shit. You only get your turn by helping him/her out. <br>
<br>
One thing that I have only seen pointed out ONCE in this entire rambling thread is what clerics on the list have to do to receive support on their turn, and why the list may eventually break down, but I don't see it happening in the near future.<br>
<br>
Old system of Rage -- Sit in Skyfire until he pops. If you are lucky, you only have a six-day camp, but since he was usually camped, your camp (if you start camping him the same day as the guy before you) is about 12 days long.<br>
<br>
New system of Rage -- You begin camping him two spawns before yours, though sitting there 24/7 is not required until your turn. You help the two clerics above you on the list with the camp. You sit in Skyfire every available minute for two other people. You take over so they can sleep, you are there so they can go make supper or take a walk to get rid of the cramps sitting in a computer chair for days on end can cause. This means during your turn, you have the support of the two clerics below you (including the support of their guilds in most cases. Clerics don't camp anything alone.). This means there are 3 clerics camping Rage at all times. This means each cleric contributes MUCH more time than in the &quot;old Rage&quot; way, BUT each cleric who contributes ends up getting his or her epic. Not sure about you, but I'll do more for a guaranteed result rather than do the minimum and know that failure is a constant threat.<br>
<br>
Eventually, if the hard feelings continue (and no matter what is done, there are ALWAYS hard feelings...it's how life works), someone will try to jump the list and take Rage. They are going to be VERY hard pressed to steal the spawn, however, just due to the sheer speed of mobilization the list has generated for the last dozen spawns, and will continue to generate simply based on the fact that instead of one, three clerics now camp every Rage spawn. This is not a threat and not meant to be taken as one; this is a fact. A fact that has been proven to work.<br>
<br>
Saying the &quot;list will die&quot; may be true, nothing lasts indefinitely, but it's going to have to sustain a lot of &quot;wounds&quot; before it goes belly up. If you jump in and gank a spawn, so what? Current cleric only has to wait one more week, with the support of two other clerics (and I am betting with a LOT more support than that). Everyone goes down one notch. I refer to my above comment - most people are ECSTATIC to have a CHANCE at Rage, and are HAPPY to be on a waiting list several months long. Jumping someone's claim won't get rid of &quot;The List&quot; (TM), at least not right away. Do you think a week means anything to someone looking at a 5 month wait? Sure, some will bitch if Rage gets ganked, especially the guy (or gal) who just sat there for a week. I bet they're not gonna give up their spot in line though and call the system a failure <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For those who are uninformed - the instability of the Quellious server this past month has been a boon for clerics. People have had a FULL MONTH cut off their estimated wait times. Those looking at December are now looking at early November. It would take 4-5 ganks (or more, if the server keeps going at this pace) to put those people back in December, so they aren't going to care if the &quot;List Force&quot; (TM) loses one spawn here or there. It will piss people off, sure; however the list WILL hold. Not to mention ganking 5 of the next 20 spawns would be a monumental effort, which would be exactly what is required to push people back to the timeslot they used to hold. <p>Katalaeia Silverdawn<Br>55th Season Outrider of Tunare <Br>Ranger Elder, Legacy of Chaos</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=Green>Moderator</font></span><br>  Posts: 412<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/14/02 10:01:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=259>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> The only reason you ask me stfu about Mlain is because you know it's a glaring problem with the list.<br>

You claim this is a good example of why the list is fair.... I claim this is a good example of why the list is flawed.  A cleric who has every other part of their epic complete and who isn't a complete asshole does NOT have their RF piece as a direct result of this.  Please explain to me how that makes sense. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufeadornlifegiver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feadorn Lifegiver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/14/02 10:21:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=260>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> That is bullshit logic salta.  So, should we judge your guild based on what you do?  So one person outa 50 is bad...that still doesnt justify changing the whole system.  There is no way to absolutly guarantee a person is done except ragefire.  <br>

WTF does this have to do with the Clerics List in Rage?  Should we see if they have an arrest record too?  If they used this stuff you would never get on the list either. <p><strong><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=158388">Feadorn Lifegiver</a></strong><br>
