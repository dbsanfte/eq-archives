<br>
Raven , talk to me ingame, we need to speak<br>
<br>
and as it stands, Fohtweny, screw you until you can prove this, you've been contradicted too many times, and it's bullshit , absolute and true<br>

I personally think your lying, and are full of shit. <br>

<br>
One of our members happens to have personal contact (as in, a phone number to reach him at on the go), and we contacted him via that.  We also traded a cell phone numbers and a few more email addresses so that communication lines may stay open a bit more in case of future issues of any kind that face our guild.  I personally gave him this URL to get on via a laptop and post his own defense, since the worth of someone's name and reputation is a worthwhile enough cause to call him.<br>
<br>
For those doubting the veracity of my statements in my prior post, all I can say is that the folks who have known me for the last two years playing have a fairly good idea of my sense of moral and ethical conduct...the point of my post was simply to point out that the Fohtweny a few folks had run into was not the *real* Fohtweny at all, but an impostor.  I came to this site after a close friend brought this URL to my attention, knowing my close personal friendship with Fohtweny and my status as an officer in Knights of Trinity would demand that I take action to start resolving what has been going on.<br>
  <br>
As to my creation date, yes, I had to create a global account with ezboard because, up to now, I had a local account only with my guild board...therefore I never had registered to go on other sites.  I've never felt a particular reason to read through all these boards...the same friend who sent me the URL also happens to send me URLs of the highlights as she's reading them at work =op<br>
<br>
The good rule of thumb and object lesson: don't give your account password out...period.  It is just not a good idea.  The havoc wrought by this entire incident is proof positive.  As of last night, Sevanthian no longer has access to either account, and it is going to *stay* that way.<br>

Sure, you didnt do it, but it's like giving your friend a loaded gun and he always talks about killing people - when he does, you are partially responsable.<br>
<br>
If you are going to share your account name / pw, do like i do, only three know it, myself, Seninder, and Hoppwin, and that's because I can walk down the street and kick hopp's ass, and sen , well ... he's normally too stoned to do much more then put me in a deathloop . <br>

<br>
In the &quot;Real&quot; Foh's thread, by his own admission, he says he was there during the incident.  &quot;I was present and saw what was going on ...&quot;<br>
<br>
Yet you made reference to him not being available &quot;for quite some time&quot; in your first post, and again in your second post, with these words... &quot;Actually, Fohtweny has been unavailable&quot;.  So I'm just wondering why, if the &quot;real&quot; Foh is not available (and presumably hasn't been able to play EQ) , how he could have been &quot;present and saw what was going on...&quot;?  And if he WAS watching, (playing another toon presumably) and saw the incident, why the hell didn't he do SOMETHING right then and there to stifle the situation and keep his good reputation intact?  Especially when he sees Foh KSing and as he put it, &quot;didn't approve of it&quot;.  And if he WAS watching then obviously he IS available.<br>
<br>
You see, it just doesn't make sense.  It appears to me that either a) Ubunoa is NOT the &quot;real&quot; Foh and is just using the account and claiming to be the &quot;real&quot; Foh, or b) someone is claiming to be both Ubunoa and the &quot;real&quot; Foh and they've managed to get themselves caught in a &quot;page 8&quot; quandry.  I'd be curious to know what the IP address is on some of these posts.  What I'm reading here just doesn't make sense.  Either Ubunoa's post is complete bullshit, or something in your story doesn't add up.<br>
<br>
So which is it?<br>
<br>
Is Ubunoa the &quot;real&quot; Foh?  And if he is, why didn't he step in and stop someone from ruining his rep by KSing when he was right there watching it?  And again, if he is the &quot;real&quot; Foh, why do you keep saying he's unavailable, like he doesn't play right now, when he obviously does?<br>
<br>
If Ubunoa is NOT the &quot;real&quot; Foh, then he needs to admit his post was complete bullshit, take the sure-to-follow flames, learn from it and move on.<br>
<br>
And besides all that, what the hell is a guy like Sev doing using Foh's account?  There's another story in there somewhere and I bet it's full of bs too. <br>
