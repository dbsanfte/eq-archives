So in my usual roleplaying reply, &quot;Sup?&quot;  I'm good at that roleplaying thing as you can tell.  &quot;Could I possibly get a rez in Velks?&quot;, says my new friend.  I don't reply at all, I'm too dumbfounded and shocked.<br>
<br>
This isn't the first time I've had requests like this one.  First off, wtf?  I'm in Trak, you're in Velk's.  That's a whole different continent.  I know you know where I am, because you obviously did a /who all cleric 56 60, and I'm hardly ever anon or role unless I'm getting bombarded by ppl for rez requests such as this one.<br>
<br>
Second off...Where the hell are the clerics in Velks?  When you enter a zone, don't you usually do a check just to at least see how many ppl are in the zone?  Was there not a single cleric on this list?  Clue number one:  If there's not any clerics in a zone, that means you're likely to die.  Why stay?  Cuz of phat lewtz?  Without a cleric in VL the only phat lewtz your ebay ass is gonna see is some threads and velium.  And if you need that, hump your ass to CC and farm it there, or would you have to send a &quot;Hail, friend.  May I bum a sow so I can hump my ass to CC for phat lewtz?&quot;  Get back on the short bus and don't get off til it stops at the school.<br>
<br>
Now let's say there were clerics in VL at the time...&quot;But I NEED a 56 rez =( &quot;.  Sorry bucko, the cute little frowning face isn't going to make me run any faster.  WTF, I never asked for a rez until I was able to perform my own.  I don't even have my friends come rez my twinks.  If you can't suck up the loss between a 49 and 56 rez (6%, maybe a whole blue pixel there) I don't feel sorry for you in the least.<br>
<br>
I prolly would have been glad to have gone and rezzed this poor, discouraged fellow if maybe a PORT would have been offered.  How the hell can you expect me to run all the way from TT to VL with a little smile on my face?  Never offered a donation either for this btw (not that I ever accept them).  <br>
<br>
I've been known to run out of my way to rez ppl for free.  I'm just not gonna click up my jboots and run across 2 continents to do it.  Call me selfish.  I'm pretty sure that not too many clerics will.<br>
<br>
Now if you'll quit eating the paint chips, I'll give you some simple rules to getting a rez.<br>
<br>
<br>
1)  Don't send me a tell &quot;Hail, friend&quot;  You don't know me, and after I rez you, you'll prolly never talk to me ever again.  Only one person that ever greeted me with that has ever gone on to my friends list.  Try something more up front, like &quot;Got a sec?&quot;  &quot;Busy atm?&quot;  Don't insult me by trying to make me think I'm going to have a new found friend for the rest of my EQ days buy rezzing you.  Truth is you'd prolly just put me on your friends list if I did rez you so that way you'd know a cleric that rezzes.<br>
<br>
2)  Have your corpse at the zone I'll be coming from.  If I'm in Thurgadin and you want me to come rez you in IC, drag your corpse to the friggin bridge, or have a buddy drag it.  Don't tell me &quot;Well, I died by this tree, and there were some cats and dervishes around.  You shouldn't miss it.&quot;  WTF do ppl come up with this crap?  I don't tote around a nec/sk/bard with me everytime I go on a rez run, and the last time I checked the cleric track corpse skill is still broken.<br>
<br>
3)  Provide transportation.  It's your corpse, it's your xp.  You want the rez 15 zones away, then you better provide me a port.  Cuz until VI installs that /piggyback command where I can just hop on your back and afk for an hour while you run me there, I'm not coming.  Plain and simple.  And if you have to get someone to port me, don't expect me to pay them for the port.  Yup, had it happen to me many a time.<br>
<br>
4)  Check my location.  Chances are, if I'm in ANY plane, Kael, CoM, ToV (the list goes on) I'm on a raid.  Don't send me a tell &quot;d00d, j00 suXor&quot; just because I'm not leaving Isle 3 of air to come rez your ass.  It's a common sense thing.  Of course, I'm probably also talking to the guy that's still looking for the Burned Woods.  I've had ppl send me tells while I'm in Hate asking me to come rez them.  And then they get pissed when I tell em no?  WTF, Dillweed?<br>
<br>
5)  Donations.  Me, I don't ever ask for donations for a rez.  I figure that that's what a Wakarez(tm) is for.  But I know there's a lot of clerics out there who do want donations, and there's not a thing wrong with it.  We are doing you a favor by saving you 8 hours of sitting in one spot to get that xp.  And what's the best donation to give a cleric?  Peridots.  Clerics stay broke 24/7 just due to peridot costs.  We usually don't get to roll on phat lewtz to sell cuz it gets defaulted the majority of the time.  The money we do get is if we're in a group that's considerate enough to give us the gems that drop to cover our expense.  I myself have went through 3.5kp in the past week on peridots alone (booo hiss raids <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Keep a stack of them on ya.  When you ask a cleric to rez you, give him 6 peridots in return.  That'll buff his whole group one time and make everyone a little happier.  And don't get pissed at me cuz I won't accept your donations.  I had a bug not too long ago that caused me to LD evertime the &quot;Gaeaan saved&quot; msg came up.  That meant everytime I banked, looted, bought, sold, and traded, I LD'ed.  I had a guy cuss me out because I wouldn't accept his donation.  WTF is up with that?  A free rez and now you're pissed?<br>
<br>
<br>
Nuff said about that.  I don't think I'm asking a lot, and I'm sure I speak for the rest of the clerics out there when I say &quot;Get a friggin clue and use the common sense the Lord blessed you with&quot;<br>
<br>
And don't ignore you're porters either...mana = downtime.  Downtime = no xp.  And trans does cost the wizzies money to cast, so at least give em enough to cover the damn cost of the regents.<br>

I dunno how this is viewed as an insult. Would you rather me say &quot;hey bitch!&quot;? I view it as an expression of conraderie, rather than a claim to friends.<br>
<br>
as per your suggestion, I will begin my tells a different manner, and see what response i get. I've never asked a cleric to come from across more than 1 zone, so I imagine that's an odd request. I like the idea posed to &quot;just drag corpse to me @ velks and I'll rez.&quot; Personally, if I was a cleric, that would be my response.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, however, clerics can't solo, and being a prick to someone in tells might be detrimental to your grouping opportunities. I've turned down people for groups because of past inferences of attitude.<br>

One of the 2 continent rez requests I had was done in complete RP, everything he said right down to his thank you and the offering of dots at the end.<br>

&quot;Sure I'll res you, can you drag to me?&quot;<br>

Honestly I'm a little tired of this &quot;Pissed Clerics Club&quot; that seems to be forming, two posts in the last what..month or two? <br>
You make a cleric to help people, eer didnt you? <br>
I mean who would lvl a character whose class is completely dependent on other players and was obviously designed to help other players then get pissed all the time when people ask for help? <br>
Yes, it can get frustrating, I have even flamed as a cleric on these boards, but it was only about a paragraph and it was only about ONE thing...<br>
People asking for a res., you traveling a couple zones to do it and wait while they pull their body only to give them a tell about 20min later asking them how its coming for them to say &quot; oh I got a res., thx.&quot; I got that twice in one day. <br>
<br>
It wasnt a list of requirements 12 paragraphs long that seems to be floating around through clerics heads these days, sorry for ranting at a rant, you are prolly just blowing off steam.<br>

<br>
And as far as any assumptions that he &quot;became a cleric to help people&quot; goes, there is a basic flaw in that theory.  We became clerics because of the abilities of the class and the potential to make a good group great.  Rezzes, heals and buffs are the main tools employed by clerics but are by no means the only ones.  Clerics can solo quite often if given the right circumstances and available zone mobs.  (And if it goes sour, we can just rez ourselves! )<br>
<br>
We became clerics because it is our nature to help others - our friends and groupmates as well as to roleplay as a character &quot;with divine goodness&quot;.   (Ever since my days of Gary Gygax' D&amp;D games my main character has ALWAYS been a cleric.  After 20 odd years of doing it, I'm damned good at it too.)<br>
<br>
But this does not mean that we have to help every single Norrathian who trudges our way with corpse and/or sad story in hand.  The time spent (notice the careful choice of verb) in EQ is of paramount importance - it's my two and a half year investment in effort.  How and when we spend our time helping others is our choice.  There is no rule which says that &quot;all porting/rezzing classes MUST help others&quot;.<br>
It's a choice we make - and not by ANY means a requirement.<br>
<br>
The balance we strike up when we choose to be a buffing/rezzing cleric is that we are limited in both combat and travel abilities.  Naturally, these two types of characters should want to support the other since we are always looking for the other's help. <br>
<br>
Right?  Right!<br>

I agree with you both. As a non cleric (I have one level 6, so she doesn't really count yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), and someone who occasionally needs a port or a rezz for someone in need, I am on the receiving end of the great clerical (and druidic) abilities. From the perspective of someone who would ASK for services, I myself realize the time invested, and how time consuming helping others can be (I do it when I can with my Shaman, and have even died helping do CR in the dumb undead zone off of WC). I would not expect a cleric to come running across two continents EVER, unless they knew me personally, had the time, and I was completely desperate. I also do not ever expect a cleric to come running even in the same zone. I do not generally expect to give nothing in return. If I am going to take time out of a cleric's day, I will make it as easy as possible, and if I have means, give them something in return of use, be it pp or sow potions (or peridot, which I will start keeping a stack of at all times). When asking a cleric for anything, we don't know what they are doing, and it is not fair to assume that just because they CAN do, doesn't mean they have the time. There are times when clerics are just hanging around, and most jump at the chance to help someone, but it is not a requirement. I have probably asked 40 different clerics for rezz's at one time or another. I do the /who cleric thing, and check zones. trying to get someone as close as possible, if they are more than one zone away, I don't even bother them. Then I send personal, respectful tells. I have never gotten a rude response, and I have always accepted declines with grace, thank them for their time. I can respect that someone is busy. I don't spend all day hanging out doing nothing, why should they? I have actually gotten clerics to come in from another zone to rezz someone, and I showed my gratitude, thanked them for their time, made sure they were compensated. As a Shaman, I rarely have time to run across a zone to buff someone, much less go to another zone to do it. I would expect no more of a cleric. There are a lot of wonderful people that are clerics, who help us in so many ways. We shouldn't take advantage, and we should respect their right to play when they want, and how they want. And as for those people who don't use their head when asking for someones time, it's their loss, and they only serve to make me look better when I ask. Keep it up! lol<br>

I know it can become frustrating, yet knowing you dont HAVE to run across a couple zones to help whomever asks should make you feel less pressure or anger. <br>

<br>
On the whole 'Hail Friend' thing... it's called being polite. You're asking for a favour and most of us act nice when we want something (regardless of whether or not we are polite normally). It's only fair really, you are imposing on someone, the least you can do is make it as pleasant as possible for them (in my case, it usually means I take a bath, to make myself less odiferous).<br>
<br>
I quite often say other things as well, such as hi, hey, sup?, whatever... the point is, to get upset about the mode of address is just silly. There is no difference whatsoever. Whereas saying 'Yo Rez Bitch, get yo ass here' (Or something to that effect) is gonna be taken the wrong way 90% of the time, especially when you've never met the person before.  Besides, even if I don't ever meet you again, it doesn't mean I won't remember the fact that you helped me out.<br>
<br>
As far as the rest of it goes, it's all spot on. It's also been said before, so I see no reason to comment on it. Sorry to rant a bit (bah what am I saying? It's a rant board!), but really... getting upset over someone starting a res request with 'Hail Friend' is just ridiculous. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13112">Mordi Tashkarii</a><br>Warlord<BR>

I generally don't go a play session without getting asked for a port.  If I'm standing in West Commons, or Dreadlands, I can expect it, and will transport folks if time and mana allows.  If I'm in Sebilis, and not standing at the entrance... WTF?  I've had people ask me to leave my group to port them out.  People have argued, whined and pleaded for a port.  The majority?  No.  The few that do are what we're ranting about.  <br>
<br>
Generally, when I don't have Gaeaan &quot;The Rez Bitch&quot; Glastig available I'm very polite about trying for a Rez.  I check my friends list for people I know fairly well.  If I approach someone that I don't know, I treat them like I would want to be treated.  Simple rule I follow.  If in zone, &quot;Hello.  Would you be willing to Rez a body if I brought it to you?&quot; and if out of zone.. generally I'd wait on a cleric coming in zone, or a friend.  <br>
<br>
On the other topic of giving ports, the common sense rule is, if you want a port, go to a druid ring or wizard spire zone.  Why?  Because it's easy on the porter.  Sure Druids have SoW and port, doesn't mean we have all day to provide transport.  I had one person ask me to port them out of Everfrost when I was in NKarana...  I suggested they get SoW and hoof it, they said &quot;It's too far to run.&quot;  Like I wouldn't have to run to EF to get their lazy ass.  <br>
<br>
Contrary to what some may think reading this thread, I'm sure Gaeaan enjoys rezzing folks, and I enjoy porting folks.  Simply because we enjoy it doesn't mean that's what we want to do all the time.  I think Verant should make it so that a Rezzer gets 1% of the returned EXP.  It's not much, but figure rezzing an entire raid, you could make a few a blue bubs off it.  Then someone could run around rezzing folks, And make exp so it's not wasting their time.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uwolfsonjakk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WolfsonJakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/3/01 6:12:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=115.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> &quot;Rezzes and You&quot;, brought to you buy Wakarez(tm)</span><hr size=1> I like the idea of rezzers getting a little exp for it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uauggust.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Auggust</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(11/8/01 12:04:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=115.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;Rezzes and You&quot;, brought to you buy Wakarez(t</span><hr size=1>   Wow..I must really be lucky...all the people that ask me for resses have been polite, try to pay me (sometimes  I accept..sometimes not) and generally provide transportation.
