How can anyone rejoice or be proud of the fact that someone in their family was responsible for so many people being crushed to death or burned alive?  WTF is wrong with them?  I wouldn't wish something like this on anyone!  <br>
<br>
People I know DIED yesterday... trapped under concrete or in the fire caused by jet fuel explosion.  Why?  Because they decided to actively work for the country that they loved as civilian or military members of the DoD.  They are never coming back.  Their families and friends must now pick up the pieces of what's left of their lives and find a way to carry on... if they can.<br>
<br>
Tixa's probably full of s--- but if he is telling the truth, believe me it won't be long before his uncle is caught and brought to justice. <p>Juror<BR>

As far as Tixa goes, after we booted Tixa, the very next person who joined our group (I won't say his name, though) said that he knows Tixa in real life... they go to the same school... so Tixa is just a f u c king child who was trying to make himself look cool by &quot;knowing&quot; what really happened... you know the drill....<br>

He wished that he had been there and seen it in person.  I took the kid aside and asked him if he understood what had happened.  Without being too graphic, I tried to explain it to him.  His attitude seemed to change a little but I am still not sure if he really got the big picture.  Perhaps at his age, it's better if he doesn't. <p>Juror<BR>

Juror I am truely sorry at your loss and your little tid bit about the child that came up to you is a reminder to us all to make sure we talk to the children around us and make sure they understand what happened.<br>

There is an emptiness and hurt inside me that I can physically feel. In some moments I am almost able to forget what is going on. I live on the West Coast, and lost no one close to me, so I can only imagine the grief and horror of those who survived or had loved ones who perished. I know that many people in EQ lost loved ones, and I am sure we have lost players as well. The effects reach all the way around the world and touch everyone in some way. It enraged me to see the people of the Middle East cheering, having parades of people throwing candy to the crowds. Even more so is the reaction of many that live here in the US. A friend at work went to a convenience store that was Muslim run, and the two men inside we cheering. I couldn't believe 1) those two men were stupid enough to do that IN the US where hate crimes can happen for no reason, without provoking someone to kick their asses and 2) these people are here in our country, engaging in business, capitalists themselves if the truth be told, and they have the nerve to cheer that 10's of thousands of people, sharing the same land, that were only going to work to earn the same honest living were brutally and umercifully murdered. If indeed Tixa is an immature child trying to be cool and inflammatory, he needs to take a good look at the news, see the footage of what happened, and realize that it is not a movie, people died, there were injuries, lives changed forever. This is no joking matter and its a good thing for Tixa that he can hide behind the protection of his computer. In the very least for mocking the situation he would be black and blue. If he is related to someone involved, I guarantee he would be dead. We as Americans are banding together to protect our own, and as unfortunate as it is, people like these that do not respect the seriousness of this situation, or that are in favor of it, they lend a bad image to those peace loving, wonderful people that come from the Middle East to the United States to have better lives, and escape the shadow of just these regimes over there that control more than we would ever imagine. Not all who come from there are misguided, evil or psychotic. I personally know a few who find this a horrible event, and yet, they will be grouped in with those who cheer. The sad thing is, it will mostly be those innocent ones, possibly in the minority, will receive feel the backlash more than the rotten ones.<br>
<br>
I am glad there is a forum to express our feelings, and it soothes the wounds some to see the patriotism and the flags. My boss just told me that we are going to mount a huge flag on our building here in the middle of our refinery, and it helps to know that as we all band together as Americans, we have, for the time being erased party lines, racial divisions (for the most part), and stand united against a common enemy. In the tragedy, hearing the reports of the people aboard the plane that crashed into PA, I can only think those people that stood up to those hijackers were heroes. I felt from the beginning that plane was intentionally grounded, and I am glad to know the extent of the heroism of those aboard. All I can say in closing is I am proud to be an American, horribly saddened by our loss of innocence, and will support whatever actions are taken.<br>
