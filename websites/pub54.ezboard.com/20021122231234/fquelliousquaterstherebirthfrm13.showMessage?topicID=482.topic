I had an experience with the aforementioned individual in City of Mist that Ithink needs to mentioned.  I was helping a fellow wizard in my guild with the brain bite spell.  When Splieve asked if he could tag along. We thought nothing of it and figured he was just there to help out another wizard.  We used the method of fluxing up to the second level then aggroing mob (a Human Skeleton) and pulling him down to bottom level where we had a necro waiting to charm the skel so our wizard could turn in bottle.  I aggroed three so the necro charms the skel then we dispose of the 2 others.  <br>
<br>
After fight the Skel was gone.  Anyone who has done the quest knows the skel poofs when you hand in item.  We ask him about it then he starts backtracking on his story saying he thought multiple people could turn in item then says he thought it was a automatic respawn.  It could almost be believable except for the fact that he never stated his intentions that he needed skel.  He kept that information from us.  Had he mentioned it we would have gladly helped him with it later.  I normally dont get worked up over a game but that made me extremely angry.  He basically used us then ganked the quest mob.<br>
<br>
edit: fair enough.  I edited your guild's name out of it.  BTW, the skell has always poofed when you give him the bottle.  He respawns shortly after he poofs which is not a big deal except the one in CoM has a place holder.<br>

I'm writing this post to further clarify an incident with the guild &quot;Bound by Honor&quot;. Apparently a few mebers of this guild are upset with me, though they didn't tell me so. They did, however send tells to one of guild officers to let him know they weren't pleased with me.<br>
<br>
I wandered into CoM tonite to see if &quot;a human skeleton&quot; was up for the wizard quest spell &quot;concussion&quot;. I ran into a group of BBH members, namely Ziggie, Wizdain, Winggace, and Evilzulak who were there for the same quest. I asked if I could join, and they invited me.<br>
<br>
Basically the quest is in 3 parts. You give an ornate bottle to 3 &quot;a human skeleton&quot;(s) and they give you back a vial of swirling smoke. Turn the 3 vials into NPC for spell.<br>
I have done the other 2 parts with a few wizards in the group, we'd just stand in line and all give the NPC the bottles and get vials back.<br>
<br>
Well, apparently, the skelly in CoM &quot;poofs&quot; when you give him the bottle. I had no idea it was different in CoM. (It may be different with the 2 other quest skellys now also, if Verant has changed the quest since I did the other 2).<br>
<br>
So when the necro, &quot;Evilzulak&quot;, charmed the skelly after we killed the 2 adds, I rushed up to give him the bottle before charm broke. Apparently I was the first to try to hand him the bottle, and he poofed.<br>
<br>
They informed me that the mob now poofs when you give him the quest piece. I apologized and told them I would stay till Ziggie got his piece. Apparently a PH popped instead of the human skelly and they disbanded me and ported out without saying a word.  <br>
<br>
For the record I did not say the quest mob would immediately respawn, because I had no Idea it would dissapear. <br>
In conclusion I would like to apolagize to BBH, everone involved in the incident, and especially Ziggie. <br>
<br>
I joined the group thinking they knew I had intentions of doing the quest too, and seeing another wizard in the group, &quot;Wizdain&quot;, I assumed all 3 of us would do the quest at the same time, just like I did with a handfull of other wizards in KC. <br>
<br>
I was wrong for assuming. Instead of saying &quot;Mind if I join you in this quest?&quot; I should have said &quot;Mind if I hand my bottle to 'a human skelaton' so I can get my 'vial of swirling smoke' too?&quot;<br>
<br>
Ziggie, I'm not on much during normal hours anymore, but I will make you a promise. I will go back to CoM and bind myself there and check every chance I get to see if the Skelly is up. I will contact you or your guild when it is, and do everything I can to help you finish the quest.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for hearing me out, <br>
Splieve Burner <br>

Fallen Eagles<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
Wingace, I know you are upset, and you have a right to be, but entitling your post &quot;Splieve of Fallen Eagles&quot; drags my guild name into this, and that's not right. This was an incident with an individual (me), not a guild. Even though you went on to single me out in the end, you shouldn't have posted a guild name. It sticks in peoples minds like phony tabloid headlines do.<br>
<br>
Posting the guild name only implies that the Fallen Eagles tolerate DELIBERATE dishonest behavior, and I can assure you they do not! Fallen Eagles are one of the finest guilds on the server and do not deserve to have their name on a flame post anywhere!<br>
<br>
P.P.S.<br>
It's still the same Splieve, Lauriston. I've been working nightshift for a loooong time and can rarely get online during normal hours. thanks for the character reference, though  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugattaka451.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gattaka451</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~gattaka/_uimages/sonic.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Makes babies cry</span><br>  Posts: 200<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/20/02 4:21:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=482.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~gattaka/_uimages/sonic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Splieve of Fallen Eagles</span><hr size=1> Well crap, it's not a flame post anymore.
