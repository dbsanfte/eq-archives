<br>
In GM # 5, if the first attempt fails, but no one else engages the mob while the first triggering group recovers, can the first group re-engage when ready or do they have to wait on anyone else who wants to take a turn before taking another shot?<br>
<br>
Also, does the triggering aspect completely disappear as soon as the first group dis-engages or is that still a consideration if they are ready to re-engage and the dragon has not been engaged by another group yet? <br>

<br>
<br>
Q) In GM # 5, if the first attempt fails, but no one else engages the mob while the first triggering group recovers, can the first group re-engage when ready or do they have to wait on anyone else who wants to take a turn before taking another shot?<br>
<br>
A.) If the first force is recooperated, ready, and able to kill and the second one is not completely or very nearly ready (like 5-10 mins from away from readiness) then yes, they may go again.  If the second force is completely ready and able to kill (in which case they probably would have immediately engaged it upon the disengagement of the first force), then no, the first force must wait their turn (and they probably won't get one, but you never know).<br>
<br>
Q.) Also, does the triggering aspect completely disappear as soon as the first group dis-engages or is that still a consideration if they are ready to re-engage and the dragon has not been engaged by another group yet?&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
A.) I'm not sure what triggering aspect you're talking about.  The skyfire spawn requires no trigger component so in failure, nothing is lost item-wise.<br>
<br>
Q.) What is &quot;fail&quot;? Is it merely the reduction of your killing force to the point that the kill is not possibile (only feigners or offline rezzers left alive, no one dealing damage)? Does &quot;failure&quot; only come when the attackers cry &quot;Uncle&quot; and leave?&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
A.) It would be the first case.  Failure means the mob is disengaged.  For example, if all that's left is feigners, camped out clerics, and a bard or druid kiting around Ragefire (remember kiting does not count as engagement) til the force can recoop, they have failed and their turn is over.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.<br>

<br>
Try playing a Warrior or Mage.<br>
<br>
You have one of the easiest Epics out there.  <br>
<br>
1. The vast majority of it can be soloed<br>
2. The Priest drops to a single group<br>
3. Ixxy is an easily triggered mob (tough bastid, but easily done if you have half a clue)<br>
4. The King is not bad at all cause he's right near Warr, Necro, and Chanter Epic drops (so raids are easy to setup)<br>
5. All of your harder event mobs ALWAYS drop your piece (so you'll never have to repeatedly farm a mob (YOU try getting a group to kill Phinny for the 20th+ time when he keeps refusing to drop your Bard, Mage, Rogue, or Wizzie piece).<br>
<br>
Cmon folks... time to take a really tall glass of STFU here, cause honestly, this cleric crap is getting old.  You whined that Rage should be moved.  Verant moved it.  Now he's another Venril Sathir, in that the fastest team to get to him, gets their shot at him (regardless of how many hours a cleric sits around waiting for him to spawn).<br>
<br>
The answer here is to just get over it.  The biggest, fastest guilds are going to own Rage for a while... and the rest will just have wait til they're done.  Anyone remember when Vis, LC, etc basically owned the Venril Sathir mobs?  Eventually they moved on.  The same will hold true with Rage.  Sure, it'd be nice to share... but that is not the Verant way.  Clerics had it easy with Rage (out of the way location, and very few issues when you really look at it), but they werent content with that.  Well... I hope yer happy now. <p><center>

<br>
I don't think any of us are debating the relative ease of this epic.  But, just because it's easy doesn't make it any less desirable.  As I'm sure you know, adding ONE epic to a guild allows them to try the harder stuff in the game, as they can risk more deaths.  It is significnatly easier to recover from a failure if there is a Epic-equipped cleric around.  Having the second cleric adds some level of security to those operations, especially if (when) the one cleric starts complaining about treated like a china-doll.<br>
<br>
Sure, every cleric wants the epic as it's a kick-ass item in its own right. But the effect on it is desired by your mates, who do not have instant personal access to a rez of their own.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd not be surprised (or particularly annoyed) if they seriously mucked with the quest making it more difficult and adding an element on non-linearity once one has the swirling pearl. Something like travel hither and yon gathering these bits and if you give them to THIS guy (a daily spawn) he summons ragefire, who drops the heart-box. This spreads the clerics at this point out to hither and yon as they gather their bits from appropriately uncommon or rare mobs, and when thier group is ready for the fight - they go do the fight.  <br>
<br>
BUT - it is up to them to determine how much they're willing to do to change this...  they CAN say &quot;we like the current situation, as it fosters inter-player communication.&quot;<br>

<br>
As to what constitutes failure - losing (getting wiped out) is failure, always has been.  If people are waiting and you fail, expect them to take their shot.<br>
<br>
As to Rage being triggered - this is silly.  The human form is a joke and can be done by one group easily.  I think he can probably be done by a bard solo given the number of charmable mobs around.  Killing the human doesnt mean anything in terms of &quot;who gets to kill ragefire.&quot;  If you spawn rage and your forces can't win the fight immediately, expect someone else to step in and take the spawn.  At the same time - kiting Rage to where the raid is gathered or while the raid (with forces in zone but not all in one place) gets to a location means that Ragefire is engaged.<br>
