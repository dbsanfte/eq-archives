God damn !!<br>
<br>
they deleted my post after a 100 replies in half an hour<br>
<br>
These were it's contents<br>
<br>
********************<br>
<br>
I'll keep it brief. <br>
<br>
I play a lev 59 Mage on Quellious, Desi Dhamaka. I raided PoH with a guildForsaken Avengers in mid-January. I told the leader that I only needed the Staff and Crown from Air for my Epic. Prior to the raid, it was established that the Staff would be defaulted to me if dropped. Lo and behold the staff drops and I get it on my 16th Inny slaying and am delirious <br>
<br>
Last sunday (2/1 my account was suspended w/o prior contact or explanation. Multiple contacts to 1-888-Station, eqmail, EQAccountStatus and the head GM of Quellious reveals no explanation on the suspension. My 7-day suspension ended this sunday (2/25) and I finally found from petitioning that my account was suspended for ninja-looting the Earth Staff and the STaff had been confiscated. <br>
<br>
Apparently another mage Vault (not from the guild raiding) on the Raid petitioned that I had ninja-looted the Staff. The GM checked that no rolls were made (duh ! I was defaulted the Staff). HE also apparently said that I did not have all items like I told the guild (since I was multi-questing the Cloak and Water Staff from friends). Anyway, the GM promptly suspended me, w/o asking anyone on the raid what happenend or doing any through check up. The Staff has been confiscated from me and given to the liar Vault who petitioned. The rules prior to the Raid said I would win the Staff, Vault had agreed to them and came for Apothic armor (I had full Apothic and PoG stuff and came only for this). <br>
<br>
Now the head GM of Quellious, Belladonnaa (Andrea Rose) has warned me that if I try to contact any GM about this matter I will be suspended again. They still have refused to listen to my side of the story. I have 40 witnesses (who are all pretty pissed as well) to corroborate the fact that I did NOT ninja-loot, the item was right-fully mine, and Vault was lying. All 40 have emailed and petitioned and have been ignored (possibly threatened with suspension too). <br>
<br>
So Vault is apparently a friend of the head GM Andrea Rose or the head GM (more likely) is just loathe to admitting a grave mistake she made and trying to cover it up by threatening me with suspension if I try to bring the matter up again. <br>
<br>
Absor, I hope you read this. I have almost no avenues left !! <br>

 When the post made on QQ was deleted Vault sent me a request to send him copies of his entries on the thread. Although the QQ archives have been deleted my personal email archives have not. Below is the original story told by Vault. <br>
<br>
Desi, I have emailed a copy to you. Good luck with Verant. I hope I have helped you out some <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Was in Hate the other night, invited by Guildleader who was hosting raid. I have full Apothic 'cept boots, and my primary objective was the get magician staff.<br>
<br>
There was a second Magician there who was going to get the staff defaulted. I wanted to have a fair roll, but the Raid Leader said, that it was &quot;his last piece.&quot; I had to argue to try and change this before we killed Inny, but to no avail.<br>
<br>
The other Magician got it defaulted(wasn't even in the guild) just because &quot;it was his last piece.&quot; After I mourned the loss of the chance of rolling for the staff... I pursued the Magician to really see if &quot;it was his last piece...&quot;<br>
<br>
I did a /who Xxxx all and saw him in Lake Rathetear... thought hrmm.. beginning of Mage Epic.. whatever. Next day /who Xxxx all and he was in Najena.. then Sol A. All the places I was 2 months ago.<br>
<br>
I sent him a tell and asked wtf was up, and how come he is just starting the quest. He continued by saying, &quot;You're just jealous I got the staff and you didn't! Can't you just accept that fact.&quot;<br>
<br>
This made me extremely mad and I told the Raid Leader about the situation - who then asked Xxxx and he denied it.<br>
<br>
There's nothing I can do but express my extreme anger at this situation. I can say I'm not extremely far into my epic, but I only need 8 more items - which to me is pretty close.<br>

I don't know Desi, though he seems like a pretty nice guy<br>
<br>
But, I do know Vault....it's funny that he was on that Hate raid with you just too loot Apothic seeing as how he won an Apothic Robe from me saying it was &quot;his last piece&quot; which obviously was not true. I could get into the whole story about how the robe was supposed to be defaulted to me and blah blah and how a few weeks later I see Vault and he isn't even wearing the damn robe (sigh, what a waste), but I won't <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Anyways my point is that Vault is a whiney ass bitch and no matter what happens he is going to complain if he doesn't get his way and he definately doesn't deserve his epic.<br>

I refused to rez Vault last night in Kael. &lt;grin&gt;  He sent me a tell begging for a rez.  I'm thinking.. I know this guy's name and I don't think it's in a good way.  I check my &quot;Never Rez&quot; list and he's not there.  I'm looking at my scribbled notes and things I keep on my favorite folks and there is no mention of him.  I started to run over there when something is tugging at the back of my skull &quot;don't rez him&quot;.  NOW I remember why I knew this guy's name.  Your post QQ a while back.<br>
