Or is it that the culture of america is changing? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
For the better part of those last 50 years, we lived with &quot;the spectre of Communism&quot;. While the Mcarthy witch-hunts ended in the 50's, I believe that, to this day, anyone who makes a stand as an atheist is considered &quot;un-American&quot; by his peers on a fundamental level. So yes, we've been living unconstitutionally for 50 years... but maybe the people who could do anything about it were afraid to mention it? You can see how unpopular this issue is. If you were a Senator or Congressman, would you really want to lose your constituency over two words?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now bout the 9th circuit. Do you know that in recent history the 9th circuit court has MORE overturned rulings as all the ALL the other circuit courts COMBINED. Their majority judgement can hardly be construed as perfect.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
As with all things, there is a reason for the 9th circuit's seemingly imperfect reputation, and it is twofold. One is volume of cases. Most circuit courts cover 3-4 states; the 9th circuit covers 9, the most of any circuit court in the country. This logically gives them more cases to review, and therefore, more cases to be overturned by the Supreme Court.<br>
<br>
The second reason is political allignments. The 9th circuit is the &quot;California&quot; court- very liberal. The Supreme Court, however, is conservative. So a good many 9th circuit decisions get struck down just because Rehnquist and his boys (and girls =P) don't like it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The senate supported 99-0 a resolution disagreeing with the 9th circuit.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

All panel courts write the majority opinion and the dissenting (minority) opinion. That's just the way they do business. Both often make for excellent reads, though.<br>

 <br>
I just wanted to clarify a bit what the founding fathers thought about religion tied with government and more importantly what they thought about christianity. <br>
<br>
Just thought Id paste a few quotes from our founding fathers.<br>
<br>
&quot;The divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity. Nowhere in the Gospels do we find a precept for Creeds, Confessions, Oaths, Doctrines, and whole carloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in Christianity.&quot;<br>
 - John Adams <br>
<br>
&quot;The way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason.&quot;<br>
- Benjamin Franklin<br>
<br>
&quot;...our civil rights have no dependance on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry&quot;<br>
-Thomas Jefferson<br>
<br>
&quot;No religious reading, instruction or exercise, shall be prescribed or practiced inconsistent with the tenets of any  religious sect or denomination.&quot; <br>
-Thomas Jefferson, Elementary school Act, 1817.<br>
<br>
&quot;(when) the (Virginia) bill for establishing religious freedom, the principles of which had, to a certain degree, been enacted before, I had drawn in all the latitude of reason and right. It still met with opposition; but, with some mutilations in the preamble, it was finally passed; and a singular proposition proved that its protections of opinion was meant to be universal. Where the preamble declares, that coercion is a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> an amendment was proposed by inserting &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; so that it would read &quot; A departure from the plan of Jesus Christ, the holy author of our religion;&quot; the insertion was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> rejected by the great majority</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, in proof that they meant to comprehend, within the mantel of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and the Mohametan, the Hindoo and Infidel of every denomination.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
- Thomas Jefferson, from his autobiography in 1821<br>
<br>
There are many more quotes I could post regarding what they personally felt about Christianity, but thats probably another thread entirely <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

These are for those who still believe the constitution was founded on Christianity. <br>

I haven't noticed anyone take that extreme view yet. The country itself was, partially at least, founded in the pursuit of religious/Christian freedom. Folks who happen to coincide with those beliefs today could use this (grasping at straws), and some probably do, to persuade others that deviating from the principles they want to see preserved would spell disaster or not be in keeping with the &quot;spirit&quot; of our nation.<br>

<br>
Franklin leaned toward Secular Humanism, Jefferson leaned toward Deism or agnosticism depending on how you read him, and Adams was simply a bothered and difficult fellow in general and likely had nothing good to say about religion or anything else =)<br>
<br>
Still, most of the rest were very religious fellows, and our collective basic morality reflects that. I do not posit, however, that the Constitution is, in itself, a religious text, far from it. It is an non-religious as a text from that time period could be.<br>
<br>
My point here is that the original framework of this nation does not trumpet atheism, it simply protects it alongside any other religion or lack thereof. The United States of America may not have been founded on Christianity, but neither was it founded on atheism. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>
