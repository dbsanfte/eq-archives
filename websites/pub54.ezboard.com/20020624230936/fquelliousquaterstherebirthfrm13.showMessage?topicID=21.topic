pissed off at a certain paladin. Consider this a rant.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After taking a little time and gathering friends from many zones away, We had settled into the Hands/WL spawn in Karnor's...ready for an afternoon of fun and possibly some loot to go around. This was cut short after we were deliberatly trained by a certain 55th paladin...<br>
<br>
After we all died, and spent a few minutes on CR...we couldnt help but notice this certain paladin and his group had setteled nicely into our freshly broken spawn. And they had the guff to charge us for rez's from the clerics handy-dandy-rez-o-matic rez stick.<br>
<br>
I know that Everquest is just a game. I know that games arent supposed to piss us off. But i am f*cking pissed at the moment. Not only did we loose a nice spawn to get. I also lost my brand new level. Yay.<br>

train another to take a spawn point and to charge for the rezzes they no nicely caused .  But the overall charging for rezzes does not bother me at all.  Go out and buy 10 peridots and look at the cost, a cleric will easily use that up in one afternoon with a group.  And because I am a druid and very close to a cleric , I know the time spen porting and looking sometimes for a corpse takes from a clerics time in Eq.  Most clerics I know give lots of free rezzes but if they do need to charge I never questioned it or bitch about it.<br>

This is what happened in this episode.<br>
I ran up to the hands room, there was no one in the room and two hands in the room. I whacked on of the hands so it would follow me.  Both hands were following me so I rooted one of them and was pulling the one that I had waked.  There was a group on the tower catwalk on the way back and a pally rooted the mob that I was pulling. Since I had engaged the mob and was pulling it this angered me.  It happened that I was in front of the steps leading to the basement and thought well if he wants my mob ... so I ran down the steps and there were three skellies there that aggroed on me and I ran back up the steps and of course they engaged the group that was whacking the hand also. I ran on to the zone.   Three of the folks in the group died.  I was sitting at the zone at this time and I was sorry I acted in anger. Masadala is a friend of mine and was in the group died.  She asked if I could find a 56-lvl rez.. I ran back up to where her body was and there was a 60-lvl cleric there with her epic weapon. I asked her to rez the folks and gave her a stack of peridots for her help... I healed the folks as she rezzed them and waited till rez effects had worn off.  The cleric was unknown to me and I was not in a group.   I apologized to the group for my actions and did what I could to rectify them.  It is not my guild policy nor is it my personal policy to act in anger toward other EQ players. <br>
<br>
<br>
I often pull hands from the hand room but not when folks are in there.  There was no one in the hand room when I went in so I pulled the two hands.  I felt it was a ks to root the mob I had pulled and this is what made me angry, and that is the reason I went and found the skellies. Two wrongs don't make a right so training for a ks does not make things right.  I was very sorry after I had 4 minutes to think of what I did. I did what I could  to rectify ... found a cleric ...gave the cleric peridots for rezzing....healed folks and waited for rez effects to wear off ... and apologized sincerely to the group.  I was not in the group that camped the hands.   <br>
<br>
I apologize here also to the folks who died.  What I did was wrong and I am sorry. <br>

<br>
Where do you get off passing judgement in public like this, Ishan? And to a member of your own guild, no less. Are you so perfect and mistake free? I know for a fact you are not.<br>
<br>
This conversation really should end now. Nothing productive will come out of continuing this. Ishan, you have quit the guild, it is time to move on. Flames will accomplish nothing.<br>
<br>
Sarnath, as an officer in the guild, please accept my apologies on the behalf of Dii Minores. It is not what we stand for and mistakes like this need to be rectified. Please contact one of us in game if there is anything we need to discuss or work out.<br>

i have been on more than one end of a intentional train.  They are not fun.  Especially when you are fairly deep in karnor's.  Killstealling, while bad, does not usually lead to death of characters.  Training is for that sole purpose.<br>
<br>
When i brought this up with my former guild, i was scolded at for doing so.  That is why i left.  Though after hearing Fuzziface's side, i would probably have left anyway.  <br>

apologies can only go so far. But it is a good step. <p><b><i>Ishan Serrasbane</b></i><br>

<br>
Fuzzi did make an apology which is good. I feel that if the cleric charged after being paid peridots for using a manaless rez then this was wrong (yes, it did involve his/her time, but they could have said no also). Though I honestly wasn't there and don't know the circumstances. This situation could have been taken care of in a better manner and I wish it would have been done so, but that's hindsight and we all know about that  <br>
<br>
Another thing... If you find there is a problem with a person in your guild, I believe the best way to resolve it is fairly privately. Not over guildchat. Speak with other officers online about the situation and also with the person involved. This way, there is less animosity over such things being made public. If a person does something wrong, it may cause hard feelings when it's brought over a more public channel. Personally, I also don't think quitting a guild over being scolded is the proper thing. Your guildmates are (or should be) your friends and you should be able to speak to them about things without recourse.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Oh yeah...One last tidbit.  If you have a problem with a person in game and they are in a guild, check for other officers online (do a /who all &quot;guildname&quot;) and speak with them about it.  I think if you have a true complaint that the situation can be taken care of without going to the boards.

<br>
1.  You don't have to be in the hand room to camp the hand room.  You can be on the tower, you can even be in the basement.  If you want to pull from the hand room, do a camp check.  If no one calls it, then by all means pull away.  If someone does, respect their camp, or expect them to &quot;KS&quot; the pulls you make from the camp.<br>
<br>
2.  It is possible to KS by accident, especially if your group is pulling to a spot, and you happen to pull a mob they regularly kill pass them.<br>
<br>
3.  You can never intentionally train someone by accident--it is *intentional*  Intentional training is a warnable/bannable offense.  There is no excuse to do it.  It is like saying that someone stole your TV, so you shot them in the head.  Although it is nice to know that you are sorry for what you did (and we are assuming that you are sincere), it does not change the fact that you a. broke a law and b. are responsible for the consequences of your actions.<br>
<br>
4.  Nitrouz Oxide should not be anyones role model.  If he says he would do something, generally it is wise to strive to do the opposite. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I sympathize for Sarnath.  I think he has every right to be pissed off at you.  I do not think an apology smooths things over in this situation.  You showed lack of judgment, Fuzziface, and who knows whether you will do the same in the future?<br>

I was not the one who trained someone in KC.  When I sought to do something about, I got scolded at.  Where do you get off on calling me garbage.  You are the one who still has him in your guild.  Ignorance!? Where the hell do you get off saying that!? I know how rough KC can be without having some ass intentionally train my ass (which i have happen more than once); do you?<br>
<br>
So until you get a @#%$ clue, shut the hell up.<br>

Some things should be done in-house. If you have a personal problem with Fuzzi, Kubi, Jaxxan, or whoever...the public boards is not the place to do it.<br>
<br>
This post was between Fuzzi and Sarnath. How did you get so involved Ishan?<br>
