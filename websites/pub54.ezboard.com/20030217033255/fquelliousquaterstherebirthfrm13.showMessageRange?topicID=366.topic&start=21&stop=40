<br>
&lt;Uh, are you reading someone else's post? I read mine, and I don't see anywhere that I said kids weren't being forced to recite the pledge, though, legally, they aren't. There are laws on the books that allow conscientious objectors to refrain from stating the pledge.&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
 The remark about kids being forced to say the pledge was in response to another post that stated that kids were not. First you say you agree then you say you dont - sorry but kids in grades 1-5 pretty much all say the pledge and very few even understand the concept of conscientious objection.<br>
<br>
 You can see my other post in the other thread for in depth analysis of your statements Bulvai.<br>
<br>
As far as the god word statement - at least bulvai quoted the entire statement Esm - take a look at the second half of what I said. I said that it COULD be used to mean other gods but typcially if someone in america says &quot;god&quot; it is CLEARLY the god of 'the book' meaning the god of Jews Muslims and christians.<br>
<br>
As far as debating religion goes I will say that yes many christians try to represent various things about buddism and hinduism. I know some hindus and they worship particular patron gods - NOT as masks to 'the all.' As far as your statment about Buddism - I think many would be quite offended at your remarks - the dictionary defines Religion as follows:<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;1 Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. <br>
2 A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. <br>
3 The life or condition of a person in a religious order. <br>
4 A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. <br>
5 A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. &quot; (Dictionary.com)<br>
<br>
 CLEARLY Buddism falls into at least category 5 if not category 2, 3 and 4. I am sorry but it appears that conventional wisdom is at odds with your view Bulvai.<br>
<br>
Lastly to the sameil person the quote you use from the first amendment -<br>
<br>
&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion&quot; - this is pretty clear - it means no religious preference can be established - forcing the kids to say the pledge - though it actually doesnt bother me in a huge way does this pretty clearly. Note that the declaration of independance has nothing at all to do with actual laws, though it did state some of the intentions of the constitutional framers - hence quoting it is pointless. i can quote madison or jefferson without much effort but their personnal predilections have nothing to do with the actual law or this debate. Note also that telling people to 'like it or leave it' clearly abrdiges the free-speach portion of the amedment which you yourself quote - can you say hypocrite?<br>

Thats a red flag that the interpreted meaning isnt exact.<br>
<br>
Specifics  you take:<br>
make no law respecting an establishment [of religion]<br>
<br>
Where &quot;establishment&quot; is clearly a noun a body of something; however in your interpretation of &quot;clearly&quot;  you change a noun to a verb in:<br>
&quot;it means no religious preference can be established&quot;<br>
<br>
established  verb.  an act of someone.<br>
<br>
So you took the constutional ammendment that said congress shall not make laws giving preferences to &quot;bodies&quot; that are of a religion.  And changed it to Congress shall not estabish a religious preference.  <br>
<br>
VERY DIFFERENT.<br>
<br>
See the key here is where is the establishment, the body,  the noun in the ammendment, that the requirement of saying the pledge of alliegance gives preference to?  It doesnt exist.  The pledge of alligience doesnt give preference to actual religious corporal body.  A THING.  Something with a sign on.  A church of england as example.   The pledge of allegiance does give mention to an abstract entity &quot;under god&quot;  THATS NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL.<br>
<br>
read the ammendment again:<br>
&quot;make no law respecting an establishment [of religion]&quot;  <br>
<br>
where the &quot;of religion&quot;  tells you what kind of &quot;estabishment&quot;  THING your dealing with.<br>
<br>
An abstract phrase &quot;under god&quot; doesnt exist as an &quot;establishment&quot;  Its abstract it doesnt have an existance such that it could be an &quot;establishment&quot;<br>
<br>
And now further bout the speration of church and state as a constitutional mandate.  It doesnt exist.  Its myth.  You get that one part of that ammendment.  Key is some letters written by Jefferson but Jeffersons letters dont ammend our constitution.  <br>
<br>
So thats it.  the first ammendmant that says in effect the government shall not give preference to a single religious incorporation then GOES ON to say that congress wont make laws restricting the free expression of a religion.<br>
<br>
Last sentence said to show a larger pattern in the court system.  Im not sure how the Judicial branch gets to uphold/restrict freely expressed prayer in a government related institution while the congress is expressly forbidden to restrict such free expression.  We have to get straight bout religion or start chiseling off our coins, chiseling off the senates stone walls, rip from the constitution ITSELF, references to an abstract notion of GOD.<br>

&quot;As far as the god word statement - at least Bulvai quoted the entire statement Esm - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     take a look at the second half of what I said.

<br>
and the first quote in question...<br>
<br>
&quot;Sorry but you are TOTALLY wrong here - god is the English word for the Christian god period. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     In other languages it is other things (such as gott in German). It can be used to refer to a god or gods plural but this is NOT the typical usage.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;<br>
-- Fkin<br>
<br>
Now that the entire damn thing is quoted, I'll stand by what I said in the first place.<br>
<br>
Fkin, nowhere in the first quote did you apply &quot;god&quot; to other monotheistic deities. You mention it can be used to refer to other god/gods but go on to say that this usage is not the norm, lending the word god inclusiveness to the Christian power by leaving others out or failing to recognize them. Take your pick.<br>

     There is apsolutely nothing unconstitutional about this law.  That is where you are mis-reading this. Once again it does not matter when it was put in or what the reason was for putting it in, it could have been put in yesterday or the day after they signed they Constitiution, it is still leagal and binding.<br>
<br>
The only way that changing this to me that is exceptable would be to petition the lawmakers to do it.  Not under the pretence that it is unconstittional but the real reason cause some people do not like it.<br>
<br>
You want it changed, do it the right way.  This is the wrong way and totally Un-American and if you do not like it move someplace else. <p><html>

<br>
Newdow is an atheist whose daughter attends public elementary school in the Elk Grove Unified School District (&quot;EGUSD&quot;) in California. In accordance with state law and a school district rule, EGUSD teachers begin each school day by leading their students in a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance (&quot;the Pledge&quot;). The California Education Code requires that public schools begin each school day with &quot;appropriate patriotic exercises&quot; and that &quot;the giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy&quot; this requirement. Cal. Educ. Code §  52720 (1989) (hereinafter &quot;California statute&quot;). n1 To implement the California statute, the school district that Newdow's daughter attends has promulgated a policy that states, in pertinent part: &quot;Each elementary school class [shall] recite the pledge of allegiance to the flag once each day.&quot; n2<br>
<br>
n1 The relevant portion of California Education Code §  52720 reads: <br>
<br>
In every public elementary school each day during the school year at the beginning of the first regularly scheduled class or activity period at which the majority of the pupils of the school normally begin the schoolday, there shall be conducted appropriate patriotic exercises. The giving of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America shall satisfy the requirements of this section.<br>
  [*3]  <br>
n2 The SCUSD, the school district that Newdow claims his daughter may in the future attend, has promulgated a similar rule: &quot;Each school shall conduct patriotic exercises daily .... The Pledge of Allegiance to the flag will fulfill this requirement.&quot; However, as discussed infra, Newdow lacks standing to challenge the SCUSD's rule requiring recitation of the Pledge. <br>
<br>
 <br>
The classmates of Newdow's daughter in the EGUSD are led by their teacher in reciting the Pledge codified in federal law. On June 22, 1942, Congress first codified the Pledge as &quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.&quot; Pub. L. No. 623, Ch. 435, §  7, 56 Stat. 380 (1942) (codified at 36 U.S.C. §  172). On June 14, 1954, Congress amended Section 172 to add the words &quot;under God&quot; after the word &quot;Nation.&quot; Pub. L. No. 396, Ch. 297, 68 Stat. 249 (1954) (&quot;1954 Act&quot;). The Pledge is currently codified as &quot;I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic [*4]  for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.&quot; 4 U.S.C. §  4 (199<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (Title 36 was revised and recodified by Pub. L. No. 105-225, §  2(a), 112 Stat. 1494 (199<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Section 172 was abolished, and the Pledge is now found in Title 4.)<br>
Newdow does not allege that his daughter's teacher or school district requires his daughter to participate in reciting the Pledge. n3 Rather, he claims that his daughter is injured when she is compelled to &quot;watch and listen as her state-employed teacher in her state-run school leads her classmates in a ritual proclaiming that there is a God, and that our's [sic] is 'one nation under God.'&quot; <br>
<br>
n3 Compelling students to recite the Pledge was held to be a First Amendment violation in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642, 87 L. Ed. 1628, 63 S. Ct. 1178 (1943) (&quot;The action of the local authorities in compelling the flag salute and pledge transcends constitutional limitations on their power and invades the sphere of intellect and spirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment to our Constitution to reserve from all official control.&quot;). Barnette was decided before the 1954 Act added the words &quot;under God&quot; to the Pledge.<br>
<br>
 [*5]  <br>
Newdow's complaint in the district court challenged the constitutionality, under the First Amendment, of the 1954 Act, the California statute, and the school district's policy requiring teachers to lead willing students in recitation of the Pledge. He sought declaratory and injunctive relief, but did not seek damages.<br>

<br>
Just cause you were lucky enouhg to go to a school that didnt doesnt mean it doesnt happen.  To me its offensive.  I dont believe in a God any longer.  If someone is going to be forced to even listen to it then why arent they allowed to recite their own  pledge that doesnt have those words in it?  Or that gives a diff  God OR Gods their due instead?<br>
<br>
Just to be fair we going to take up the whole school day so that each religion can be represented.  Its truly the only fair way to deal with it.<br>
<br>
And for all those saying it dont matter that it isnt religiously significant then just subsititute devil in for god.  since many religions have a devil as many have a god.  and some people believe in the sovereneighty of him over god anyway.  I mean hey, got to be fair.  <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143487">

<br>
Not at all. A belief system must have some sort of higher being to be termed a religion. A philosophy is a belief systems sans godhead, in generic terms.<br>
<br>
&quot;Atheism means a disbelief in a deity. That is all... so I suppose it is a non-philosophy as you put it.. but I do not think you meant it in that way.&quot;<br>
<br>
I called atheism a non-philosophy simply because it is conceived of only in the negative. Without other religions and belief systems to refute, atheism would not exist. Anything based solely upon the negation of others things is a non-thing, in essence. This is why I call it a non-philosophy.<br>
<br>
I thought of using the term anti-philosophy, as it is perhaps more correct, but I knew that our average reader would likely assume that I was saying atheism was against philosophy instead of simply being a negation of other philosophies.<br>
<br>
&quot;I find that you are implying that atheist have no philosophy.. Although... everyone follows a philosophy.. there is no way around it.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, as I said above, they have a philosophy, it is simply a contrarian one and thus cannot stand on its' own.<br>
<br>
As to everyone follwoing a philosophy, I would have to disagree. I see far too many people that live an &quot;unexamined life&quot;, and show no evidence of a guiding philosophy. Sad, but true.  <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

As far as your &quot;first you say you agree and then you don't&quot; line, I am not entirely clear on what you are saying I agree with, then don't agree with.<br>

&quot;You can see my other post in the other thread for in depth analysis of your statements Bulvai&quot;<br>
<br>
I look forward to it, Fkin.<br>
<br>
&quot;As far as debating religion goes I will say that yes many christians try to represent various things about buddism and hinduism. I know some hindus and they worship particular patron gods - NOT as masks to 'the all.' As far as your statement about Buddism - I think many would be quite offended at your remarks&quot;<br>
<br>
You're a tricky one, Fkin. You adress your following argument to Esmalyn, then switch back to me. I'm onto your ways though =)<br>
<br>
So, you are well versed in Hinduism and Buddhism, Fkin? Would you like to debate the difference, structurally, between asamprajnata samadhi and samprajnata samadhi when compared to older dualism Hindu philosophies? Perhaps you'd like to discuss how Arjuna's battlefield vision in the Vedas was an analogue to the Christ story, or how you can see the difference between pre-Aryan and post-Aryan godheads in Hindu art. Maybe you just want to school me with your mighty knowledge of Chan Buddhism, or your virtuous retelling of the tale of Siddharta Gautama?<br>
<br>
I've gone to Buddhist temple and learned Zazen techniques ancient before this country was founded. I've published scholarly works on Koans found in &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot;. <br>
<br>
I have a frikken B.A. in Philosophy and a minor in Theology. Don't presume to refute what I say about religion unless you are prepared to back it up. I'll gladly debate religion all day, but I won't sit by and listen to you tell me that I am wrong because you have an imperfect understanding of the faith of your &quot;Hindu friends&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;CLEARLY Buddism falls into at least category 5 if not category 2, 3 and 4. I am sorry but it appears that conventional wisdom is at odds with your view Bulvai.&quot;<br>
<br>
There is little conventional about this supposed wisdom. Dictionaries do not define the existence of a word, they explain how the common man uses the word in modern parlance. I am fairly precise when I speak. I do not call a religion a philosophy, or vice versa. <br>
<br>
&quot;2 A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship.&quot;<br>
<br>
A Buddhist does not worship, per se. There is no godhead in Buddhism. I have already explained this. Try reading &quot;Zen Flesh, Zen Bones&quot; if you need help understanding.<br>
<br>
&quot;3 The life or condition of a person in a religious order.&quot;<br>
<br>
Buddhist monks are part of an instution, yes. So are college professors, and they aren't a religious order.<br>
<br>
&quot;4 A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader.&quot;<br>
<br>
How nice. In this case, this dictionary is calling Confucianism a religion as well, and Communism, Socialism, and an awful lot of other -isms that have nothing to do with religion. There is a difference between reverence and worship.<br>
<br>
&quot;5 A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. &quot;<br>
<br>
ROFL! By this definition, Baseball, football, and hockey are all religions, as are chess, television, and EQ. <br>

Did I say I agreed with this or said I liked it? No, people do automatically assume an aweful lot though and this was the crux of the problem.<br>
<br>
 Bulvai - after taking a large number of graduate level philosophy courses and a MA in History I WILL dissagree with you. I might add that a minor in theology (particularly if it comes from an institution with a religious axe to grind means little).<br>
<br>
 I would also say the since the various followers of the various Hindo gods keep statues of the god they worship, adorn their bodies with decorations depending on which god they worship (such as the lines painted or tatooed on if you worship Vishnu), and lastly the differing precepts followed depending on which god you follow very definitely shows that these gods are worshipped for what they represent and not as a mask. <br>
<br>
 It is also clear that you feel free to discount widely used concepts if they dont agree with your own twisted logic. I am sorry but its VERY clear that Buddism falls under the definition of religion, and unlike YOUR definition my definition has an actual basis in not only conventional definition and usage but actual accepted meaning. Sure I am sure you have your own radical splinter group beliefs, and much like the flat earth people you are willing to argue your view and muddy the discussion with various broad statements of psuedo fact, but the fact remains, in many cases I addressed all of your points with references and examples, you never responded with much in the way of anything past generalities. I also have visited Buddhist temples in the Seattle area and listen to the Dahli Lama speak on two separate occasions there. It simply amazes me that one person can seriously disregard the actual definition of a word, the conventional usage, and the accepted typical meaning of a word (in this case religion) and propose their own radically different definition and expect to be taken seriously - astounding. Again, Buddhism and its practice is filled with references to temples, monks and monestaries and it is considered a religion and a religious way of life inherent in its very definition. Again - straight from the dictionary - note well point 2.<br>
&quot;<br>
1 The teaching of Buddha that life is permeated with suffering caused by desire, that suffering ceases when desire ceases, and that enlightenment obtained through right conduct, wisdom, and meditation releases one from desire, suffering, and rebirth. <br>
2 The religion represented by the many groups, especially numerous in Asia, that profess varying forms of this doctrine and that venerate Buddha. <br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Whyspirit did you even read the thread - I think it was bubalotski who posted the facts of the case that 1) the pledge was being FORCED on people and that 2) the person who brought the case was being directly impacted.<br>
<br>
Lastly to the person who mentioned the word 'establishment' and decried the usage I used - the supreme court has historically agreed with my usage numerous times to this point - I would be interested to see ruling supporting another interpretation.<br>

<br>
What if it wasnt &quot;under god&quot;   What if it was &quot;under a Moral Authority&quot;  No really.   It goes directly to the source of the anger.   <br>
<br>
This has little to do with religion. this has everything to do with dissident people whos notion of liberty attacks everything that can be construed as majority constructed moral authority.  <br>
<br>
This isnt secular versus fundamentalism in the government.  If it was stated &quot;under a moral authority&quot; in  the Pledge of Allegiance  there would STILL be a parent who claimed their child was injured by have to watch that recited.  that the government didnt have a right to claim itself under a moral authority.  That it was a belief that constituted religion.  <br>
<br>
The issue is that some people cannot abide by a central majority constructed authority.  Thats the issue.  And they kick and scream.  <br>
<br>
And i cant abide by these people any more.  <br>
<br>
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND YOU IF YOUR SENSE OF LIBERTY HAS US MUZZLEING THOSE THAT OFFEND YOU.  The case was stated such that the parent still had a problem with his daughter just SEEING people recite under god.   no doubt similiar arguments were made in the cases where prayers before football games were inappropriate.   That injury was done by just viewing this act in an unavoidable setting.<br>
<br>
Thats not embracing liberty.   Thats not an enviornment where pursuit of happiness is central.  Thats something else.  Something gross.<br>
<br>
Also inherint in the arguments is the majorities right to express themselves in their government.  Punishing the majority simply because they are is no more healthy then prosuing the minority.  <br>
<br>
I have no liberty if prosuing my liberty is claimed as injury to another party.   You have no tolerance if your injured or offended by those that act publically in their beliefs no matter how unavoidable.  If your notion of tolerance is such that you can claim to be peaceful with it only if you dont see it then how tolerant are you?  If your offended by the sight of prayer how tolerant are you?   I dunno.<br>

<br>
Everyone is free to take a side on the issue but it must be unconstitutional if the court deemed it so. That's not to say I always agree with a court's findings on everything, but the cause for amending the pledge is clear: a moral counter to communism using a reference to a god, supporting, or at least instilling the idea of a higher power, not just merely make mention of a higher power which wouldn't have had as great an impact for the president and company. A lot of things legal and binding can also be unmade just as this was. You're speaking of the past now.<br>
<br>
&quot;You want it changed, do it the right way. This is the wrong way and totally Un-American and if you do not like it move someplace else.&quot;<br>
<br>
I agree this man did it for all the wrong reasons. But! he did not win because he's smarter, or slicker, or [insert adjective]. He won because the pledge is unconstitutional, regardless of who brought it to light. That is independent of this griefer. I'm not sure what you mean by totally un-American. Stripping &quot;under God&quot; from the pledge would have such an impact on our lives that it would bereave us of all reminders that the country was founded by religious practitioners alongside of deists? I doubt it. What is totally un-American is deciding what can be argued and what will be accepted as absolute truth.

<br>
Well, is used to call myself an agnostic, but then realized that I cannot claim even an unfocused belief in a godhead. I consider my lack of faith to be a personal failing, frankly. I feel that it is a sign that I might just lack strength of conviction. Realistically, it is a sign that I am perhaps overly rational and cannot accept the idea.<br>
<br>
Until I can figure out the faith issue, I'll just call myself a lapsed Taoist and move on =) <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

Whoever actually cares that the word &quot;god&quot; is on their money and that the word &quot;god&quot; is in some silly pledge... just has too much time on their hands...<br>
<br>
I don't believe in any of that stuff and I could care less where the word &quot;god&quot; shows up ;p<br>
<br>
I don't ever recall them making me say the pledge with the rest of the class while I was a student, and I don't recall actually knowing/wanting to know what it meant when I was that young either ;p<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact is, the kids that this is trying to &quot;protect&quot; could most likely care less and/or not know what it even means ;p<br>
<br>
Get a life people...<br>
<br>
I think the stupidest thing here is that my tax dollars are being used to fund these types of court cases... I can think of more homeless kids in africa, more roads that need to be paved, more teachers who need pay increases and supplies, more law enforcement officers who need pay increases and training, more schools that need books  than I can think of reasons why I should be funding this sillyness. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=366.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=366.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=366.topic&start=61&stop=70>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=366.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=366.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=40><img src=http://quellious-collective.com/reply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=366.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=366.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=366.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=366.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm23">Archives-General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm24">Archives-Flames</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.107<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
