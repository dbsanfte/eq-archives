<br>
Lately, we've been working up some changes to help balance out the cleric class. This is important to get done before Planes of Power, as it's the foundation for the growing role of priest classes in the future of EverQuest. The goals behind these changes are to - <br>
<br>
- Provide clerics with useful group and raid roles as other priests gain raid quality healing <br>
- Decrease the cleric's mandatory dependancy on grouping for any reasonable gain <br>
- Increase the level of variety and interest involved in playing a cleric <br>
<br>
The first part of the change was to add the following spells - <br>
- Hammer of Judgement - CLR/56 (summon a hammer with a powerful and frequent proc effect) <br>
- Yaulp V - CLR/56 (self only melee and mana regen buff. Adds haste, dexterity, mana regen, and stamina regen) <br>
<br>
These spells are useful in allowing the cleric to do a new form of combat damage. Clerics use the new Yaulp spell to gain melee haste, standing mana regeneration, and increased Dexterity. This helps out a great deal by allowing the cleric to use their new summoned hammer at peak efficiency. <br>
<br>
The summoned hammer is a unique weapon in that it has a very high proc frequency, doing 75-150 damage per proc. This allows clerics to do reasonable melee style damage by relying on the procs alone. The cleric's pet &quot;Unswerving Hammer of Faith&quot; has had it's mana cost and casting time lowered, as well as it's effectiveness upgraded. The hammer pet cannot be riposted or effected by spells, though it is rapidly killed if no one is tanking for it. The hammer pet still poofs after each combat, but for the new price of 250 mana, it adds an amount of damage that's very competitive with other damage-over-time spells. <br>
<br>
Using Yaulp + the Hammer of Judgement, the cleric begins to be effective in toe-to-toe combat. Other supporting spells available to the cleric are his low cost summoned pet, and the Mark of Retribution/Mark of Karn spells. Using a combination of these spells, along with the clerics excellent buffs give surprisingly good results. In testing, clerics have been effective soloing the entrance to Charasis and Chardok, grouping in a number of high end dungeons, and even making reasonable experience as a two-cleric duo in Cazic-Thule. <br>
<br>
This upgrade allows clerics a new style of relatively effective soloing, as well as some excellent options to add value in groups. While this may not be sufficient to get clerics into groups by itself, it does add significant value and allows even multi-cleric groups to be profitable. Fairly extensive play-testing, both by game designers and clerics on test have proven these spells to be effective, and perhaps more importantly, very entertaining to use. <br>
<br>
In addition to the added spells, we'll be trying out the Bash skill for Clerics, beginning at level 25. While this skill will cap out lower than their melee counterparts, clerics should still get a decent amount of value out of this addition. It adds a bit of damage as well as a free chance to stun opponents. This also works well with the recent improvements to shields on Test, that give a meaningful boost to armor class, in addition to a chance to block incoming blows. <br>
<br>
The following heal spells were added to the cleric class - <br>
- Ethereal Elixir - CLR/60 (group version of the Celestial Elixir heal-over-time spell) <br>
- Ethereal Light - CLR/58 (upgraded version of Divine Light single target heal) <br>
- Ethereal Remedy - CLR/59 (upgraded version of Remedy single target heal) <br>
<br>
These spells are not expected to add a great deal of power to clerics, as clerical healing is already more than sufficient. These spells are all minor but useful upgrades to existing clerical heals. The goal with these spells is to round out a cleric's healing versatility and allow them to tailor their memmed healing line-up to whatever adventuring situation they find themselves in. With this large selection of healing spells, clerics are able to fit various situations more efficiently than any other class. <br>
<br>
It's important that clerics maintain their role as the premier healer of the game. Raid quality heals are being added for other priests to allow them to fulfill their role as secondary healers in most situations. Clerics have always been a healing specialist, but the situation has escalated such that many raid level encounters may not be undertaken without disproportionally large numbers of clerics. No other class has been able to fill in if a cleric is absent, and healing is too important of a role to allow one class to dominate it so completely. After these changes are complete, clerics will still be the very best of healers but other priests class are able to substitute to some degree. <br>
<br>
Clerics are going to receive additional changes so that they have some abilities that makes them more sought after for grouping. The final ability choices will be made after this first set of changes is evaluated and tested more extensively. It's very important that clerics have an ability that makes other players say &quot;I really want to invite a cleric because they can do X, and that will be really helpful.&quot; This is vital to the health of the class. All priests should offer a similar level of value in solo, group, and raid situations, and they won't be considered balanced until this is true. <br>
<br>
We understand that there's a lot of trepidation at major changes, and fears that your class will become less valuable in the game. When the changes are finished, I think most people will be pleased and will feel that their concerns have been listened to and addressed. The health of all classes in the game is as important to the dev team as it is to the many people who've spoken up passionately about their concerns here on this board. <br>
<br>
Thanks for your patience, <br>

<br>
This is a great idea, let's make other priests slightly better healers so in a pinch you can group semi-efficiently without a cleric, then let's take the clerics out of the groups so they can go solo.<br>
<br>
Why do I have visions of a group that consists of 2 clerics nuking, 3 clerics meleeing, and a druid healing? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umocean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mocean</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/23/02 4:39:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=487.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Combat Clerics!</span><hr size=1> Hehehe, sounds like fun to me. :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uacturian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Acturian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>EHAL!</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/23/02 5:27:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=487.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Combat Clerics!</span><hr size=1> im scared<br>

<br>
I'm also skeptical about this.. If they are giving clerics a decent form of melee.. They should give it to all casters.. As a wizard it would be nice to be able to stand up and hit something with my stick and actually hit it.  Nothing too powerful of course... but maybe 10-20 dps for when a wizard is oom. <p><center>

<br>
heh, thats how camelot groups were alot of time, in fact when they had the statistics laid out of the percentage of people who played each class, I think the cleric class had a wopping 37% of the playerbase, leaving the other 63% split over 8 or 9 other classes. <br>
<br>
Clerics were some of the best solo'ers in camelot, unless you went full heal (Rejuvenation), since i was full rejuv, I was in a number of groups of 8 people that had 2-3 tanks, a minstrel or sorc(chanter), a nuker or pet class, and then like 3-4 clerics. Usually 1 healing cleric and two smite/nuke clerics (who would also melee a great deal), or sometimes two healing clerics, and one nuking cleric. <br>
<br>
Anyways my point? Well it was weird havintg so many clerics in Camelot, but sounds like if they buff up clerics melee a bit, and (maybe in the future) give them some stronger nukes, they could easily end up having clerics performing two roles in a group in everquest, then again, eq is 6 group slots, not 8.. so &lt;shrug&gt;<br>

Complete Heal, 56 Res (epic), and Phat AC/HP buffs. What do we need clerics getting aggro and being eatten? I myself, think Cleric's are more wanted in a group then almost any other class, even enchanter, dru/wiz, warrior, anything really. You do see groups go without a cleric, but when someone dies. Yey Pally res or pay for one and waste even more time getting the corpse to a cleric. no thx. some of it is good, but when clerics get to much aggro from dealing damage, then go to CH, death. maybe not, maybe they'll make some wired rule to override the hate list. but who knows. If any class should be dealing more melee damage its a warrior.<br>
because thats who keeps those mobs pissed off, and away from our beloved dorfs, elves, lings, and nomes<br>
<br>
Maybe they got something big planned for us warriors when EQ goes PoP, but who knows. I really think taunt, bash, and damage should be looked into for the warriors.<br>
<br>
not to put down anyone but i had to laugh when Gae said well then they should let wizards do more damage too, or something to that affect. I mean seriously you think you should be doing more damage? Wizards already do mass damage along with the 5 rogues people use to stab the rear. but if you really want to do more damage melee style, along with clerics and other casters. please varent give it to them and watch them say umm maybe if the tanks could control aggro, we wouldn't be getting hit so much. hey i'm not say warrior's can't control aggro. i'm saying if casters get to do more damage, tanks better be able to counteract with either damage output, or better control. <br>
<br>
When i see in my mind a cleric or a pure caster trying to hit mobs, it makes me laugh. i mean if you wanted to do more melee damage and still cast, you should of been a ranger, shadowknight, or a paladin. <br>
<br>
I guess i'm flaming this, because it doesn't make sence in my eyes. I don't think clerics should have bash, i don't think they should deal more melee dmg (themselves) and i don't think they are unwanted in groups. so either i've been away from the game to long or i have 50,000 other tanks along side me with this, Warrior's in particular.<br>
<br>
Maybe they want clerics to die more, because they know how people feel when someone says, did any clerics camp? no they were %t's snack.<br>

I agree and Im a cleric but I think the cut and paste from Verant was in reference to the new healing spell druids will be getting 75% health or 2000something HP's basically a weak CH, read that one too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I think this is verants way of counteracting the problems clerics will have finding exp groups after the druid heal goes live.<br>
<br>
Lots of druids wanting to group that can heal as well within EXP grinds = clerics without groups that cannot solo.<br>
<br>
Who will be doing the healing and resing if we cant lvl efectively?<br>
But I agree with Coert, if I wanted to spend my time soloing I woulda made a druid. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

If you really plan on holding a joke I made about the stupid threats of a fucktard ranger and his stupid queer guildy sidekick Mlain against me forever please contact ezboard so we can come up with an ignore feature.  This way I won't have to read you're completely uncreative and witless attempts to humor.<br>

I only brought it up because you know someone as anal as FK would point out the same exact thing if the tables were turned.  Gaythan's point about it being a hot topic actually makes a lot more sense if you consider it.  If I actually did care so much about what I said in the original post and you couldn't take it what it was meant to be (a friendly jab at FK) why didn't I just move the post to the general section myself? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umiinaredrose.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miina Redrose</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Tank Girl</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/24/02 10:03:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=487.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Combat Clerics</span><hr size=1> well if it belongs in the General? ok im flexable :/<br>

And this is a friggin flame board so i was complaining instead of going ooh ah. Cus basically, int casters got some semi alright focus items (which priests have too) and pets got slightly better. Now theyve moved onto the priests. Great, so a wiz can now crit once every 3 hours until hes high enough to have AA, and sacrifice stats for focus items to make them slightly better than being naked. Great revamp.<br>
