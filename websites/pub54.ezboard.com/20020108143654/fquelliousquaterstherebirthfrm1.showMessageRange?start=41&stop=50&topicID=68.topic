This week was no different from other weekends really. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Did a lot of raiding, was fun over all except for a minor low point Sunday.  <br>
<br>
Friday night I logged in... hm.. no clerics online.. doh.. no raids tonight! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Wizzie wanted to kill the Spy in SS.  So 1sk+2pallies+Enchanter+wizard+necro went merrily to SS to kill him.  He wasn't too hard really, lvl 55 mob, hitting in the 150ish?~200, but with the then lvl 58 Paladin as the only true source of healing... lucky SK did not bite the dust! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Let's just say it was the start of an insane night lead by bunch of truly insane people. Next we hit a_random_cube_loittering_around_the_area_who_happened_to_be_carrying_a_ sword.  Yeah yeah.. we are bad, but it was carrying a very beautiful sword that looks like Dewius' Nature Defender but one handed.  Of course it turned out to be a piece of pile. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    But hey, exp is exp and nothing that factions can be gained back easily. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Wizzie had a part for the Traitor Quest.  So we went to do the Dragon Tooth Choker.  Whee, and I get to have it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Thanks guys.  +30hps and tons of resists just RULEZ.  <br>
<br>
Now.. next comes the fun part.... We decided to hit Fear for the last bit the wizzie needs. Something about a Broken Golem...  So 15 or so of us packed up and met at portal.. here's the kicker.. NO CLERIC on the break in.  Are we insane or what?  No shaman either to slow!!!  So we invs up, run in and landed in a spot that we thought is &quot;safe&quot;... Wrong!  Hehehe.. out pours the mobs onto us. I think there was 10~12 in camp. I really don't know, I wasn't counting.  Dorrin, the ranger had the presence of mind to kite them around while Valdayana, our only enchanter mez the rest while rest of us helped by beat up on them one at a time. People definitely helped too by root/parking the extras/adds.  We had to LH Dorrin, but other than that only 1 casualty. By this time the cleric has made it in and proceed to train us with a few more mobs!!!  This has to be the first time I hear the phrase, &quot;TRAIN US!&quot; in the planes.  <br>
<br>
Just 4 months ago... I would have died in any train similar to that... hell just 4 months ago, I did die in many many trains with just 2~3 mobs in camp.  It's amazing the difference a little time and lvl made. <br>
<br>
Back to Fear Story...  So we killed mobs around the zone, ironically Valor helm and Legs dropped...<br>
Dewius tells you, &quot;Do you want it?&quot;  <br>
&quot;No.&quot;<br>
&quot;C'mon, take it for spares.&quot;<br>
&quot;No, I have no room in bank!&quot;<br>
&quot;Bah, fine... I'll take them as my CR set.&quot;<br>
&quot;Whatever, no room in bank!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Anyway, the 3 golems.  Hm.. well.. they Death Touch now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Very annoying....  So.. we pretty much just jumped #1.  It went down. Now #2 was tricky.  We thought this was the Vox Clone one.. So when we heard Dorrin's name shout across the zone, we were like.. OOPS!  Jump it!  #3 was even more hilarious.  Alot of us were following Dorrin when we literally run into it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Bah.. lost Ranger.. bah..  A bit more people went down this time since we DID NOT KNOW we were suppose to fight it yet.  <br>
<br>
This fight was funny actually.  Llewyn, our poor cleric got 1 CH off on Daks before the Golem ate her for dinner.  So Daks was kept alive by Arclight's, Dewius and my LH.  Arclight also went down after his LH got the Golem's attention. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    By the time I got around to LH Daks, he has so much of the Golem's aggro, I did not die.  Daks also has some insane HP.... I think Dewius and I both LH him at the same time... yet due to the dmg he was taking and his HP, we only filled up 80% of his red bar.  No golem for wizzy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    But we did get the necro part!!!  Yeah Drakahn and yeah Nurli for default it to Drakahn.  <br>
<br>
Quotable quote of the night.  Daks shouted, &quot;I got laid three times!&quot;<br>
<br>
I got translocated out after that fight.... too tired.. was suppose to be in bed 2 hours ago but stayed up only because a certain ranger promised only 30 more minutes!!!!!  *kicks Dorrin*<br>
<br>
Some of the shaman only belt dropped.  Valdayana more or less commanded me to grab one and deliver it to Saldaria, this sweet shaman who have been posting on Everlore. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
<br>
Saturday-<br>
<br>
Ixbit Fer for 5 clerics. I can't begin to say even though it took forever for everyone to gather and thanks to some lamer kiling Naxot just because... we did not start until 4pm pst. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    But it was great really.  There can never be enough Clerics with epics running around.  More of them=more chances I get ressed when I do something stupid when I am just running about.  Trust me.. there's a reason why I am rarely not DMF or Levitated in GD, EW or IC...(can we say 10k fall?)<br>
<br>
Next we hit ToV.  Nothing eventful.... I got really really sleepy and went to take a nap.  I was suppose to get up in 2 hours... but.. it turned into a 10 hour nap.  Doh..  Lucky for me I woke up and found me in Thurgadin!!! Yeah translocators. <br>
<br>
<br>
Sunday-<br>
<br>
After that we did Kael for a couple hours.  Factions are nice, but Arena was overkill with 20~30 people. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I got so bored that I translocated out when a wizard did the death run in. Helped a friend got 59th duoing the Sentient Armors... now here's more complaints... why can't Droods(not Druids) learn how NOT to kite over people medding?  3 different druids kited over us while we were medding.. grrr...<br>
<br>
ToV again.. but I left early to deliver the belt Valdayana wanted me to drop off.  After telling Saldaria some tales and gotten her drunk.. I went to bed.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Thus conclude the very interesting weekend. <br>

<br>
basically hit the Spiroc Lord hard enough, and he coughs up Wing Blades...and Symbols of Marr (AC15 5str/wis, thx la~) and somewhere along the way i pick up a belt of virtue (i wonder if the haste on that has been upgraded from 16%, no matter, it's still kick ass).  Most, if not all the fighters who were in Air get wingblades, Lugor finishes his epic 2 minutes after getting the wingblade, and i jump to hit the bazaar. gotta get rid of the this SotM, y'know...<br>
<br>
10 minutes into hanging out in the bazaar, someone auctions off a DW BP. Kinda shocked, i relay it to the guild...and a day later, i got a new BP (completely unexpected, and wholly appreciated - thanks Wyen for being the dealmaker!).<br>
<br>
Also throw in an outdoor concert on Friday, and a trip to the Ren Fair on Sunday, and you got one helluva weekend!<br>

Oh let's see if I can remember right.. I think Friday night my Ranger Tracey and her wife Atanall made 21st at KFC in SK.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Then later on in the night went to help Jinnikinic in City of Mist with a quest.  I forget who all helped (I remember Kumasho, Bareldi, Munger, Shannon for a sec, and an enchanter whose name started with an A (I was kinda drunk and tired when I was doing this LOL) but several died in attempts to charm this Human Skeleton so Jinni could give it this item (some as a result of other's pulls ground pounding us).  Anyway, we'll know what to do next time.<br>
<br>
Saturday my sis Atana and I decided to get all our characters Crude Stein's.. which we were successful in doing.  <br>
<br>
Then briefly visited with Llorac to trade an item.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Then later on helped PL friend's warrior a bit.  By the way, unless I know you very well, don't even bother asking me to PL you.  I don't even PL my friends that often. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Sunday did not feel like playing until late.. thought I check my chances in EC in getting some Gnomeskin Boots.  My first auction got a response.  Now I shall move onto something else lol.  Then helped a friend make HG fertilizer in Rathe Mountains later on for a bit of cash and to take it easy.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
So anywhooo i start out saturday planning on joining my guild in Kael. Sadly i went LD and had a hard time connectiong to EQ again /rude verant.<br>
<br>
So a friend calls up while im thinking up more nasty things to call verant, and said quote 'Playing baseball get your ass out here' then he hung up LOL. We meet at a local 7-11 (the same one we pulled a WAAHOOO on senior year <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .. btw if you dont know what a waahooo is, i trully pity you). After loading up on many cases of beer we head out to the ONLY un-unsed field in the area... a little league field /sigh<br>
<br>
We dont really have enough people for a full game and its such a small feild, so we played Home run derby instead. After a while, it became Strike out derby LOL. I'll explain for those of you who grew up in the basement (btw sunlight is good. the sun is our friend nice sun nice) See on a little field the distance from the mound to the plate is half that of a normal one. Also keep in mind we throw faster than most little leagures (cept you Adam you still throw like a fruit). On a NORMAL size field you have time to look at the pitch and tell what its doing. IE the laces on the ball are red and when thrown they make a pattern depending on what type of pitch it is. By watching the direction of the spin, you can determine what its going to do.... unless you're only 40ft from the pitcher <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Needless to say i got nailed with a breaking ball that i thought wasn't going to break. Hence my then black and purple finger. Oh well beer on.<br>
<br>
The next morning i get up and well my hand isnt looking to pretty. So you guessed it Doctor time. Doctor asks &quot;Why did you wait till today to come in?' i respond 'After 12 beers it didnt hurt anymore'. Doc says 'do me a favor, if you ever lose a limb have someone else decide if you should come to my office'. <br>
<br>
well another broken bone, oh well no cast at least. Watched Sopranos (love that show i wanna be a mobster when i grow up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) went to bed back to work on monday.<br>

<br>
Sunday I went with guild to raid the TFS.  Ranger died within first few pulls (she always gets herself killed for some strange reason) but rest of us made it out alive and encumbered.  My group decided to stay after rest of raiders left.  We were on the 3rd floor trying to get key for someone when I went LD.  I came back as soon as I could to find myself alone in the hallway.  I looked around a little to see where everyone went.  I did a /who to see if they had to zone out.  Not only were they still there, they were the only people in the entire Tower.  <br>
<br>
Then I hear shouts from the 6th floor.... <br>
<br>
Help! Tierman just went down.  <br>
Get up here quickly, we need you.  <br>
Oxxan and Creche can't hold the mobs and are dying.  <br>
Epi is out of mana, has 3 mobs on him, and can't evac.  <br>
<br>
I think OMG, my whole party is about to be wiped out.  I feel so helpless.  I yell that I can't come up because I don't have the key.  I start rummaging thru stack of stuff on zone to see if there is any other way to get up top.  No... nothing.  More pleas for help come.  I check to see where other guildmembers and friends are.  Nobody is close.  I sit down and mem invis / get out ITU potion.  A shadow wanders by and attacks me.  I root it and throw a few DOTs on it but it has me trapped in corner.  I start to melee it to try to get past it.  Suddenly four figures appear around me.  The bastards had decided to play a practical joke on me and camo'd themselves near mirror.  All the time I was pacing back and forth trying to figure out how to &quot;rescue&quot; them, they were right there next to me.  Good practical joke, isn't it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
