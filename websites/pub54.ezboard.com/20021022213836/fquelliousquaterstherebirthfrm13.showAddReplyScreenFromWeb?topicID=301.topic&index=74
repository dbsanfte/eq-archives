Just make it so that the parents share the culpability (and eventually the verdict) of the ones who perpetrate such heinous crimes.  Then you'd see some SERIOUS ass-whuppings become more in vogue.  <br>
<br>
Today, kids are sueing their parents if the parents hit them.  That's BS.  Wanna see someone throw down a beating on a kid who's done something severely wrong?  Watch me.  I'll televise that beating on the web.  I'm 6'3&quot;, 260lbs and meaner than fiery hell when I get angry.  It takes a lot to piss me off, but when I do.. I'll go all Bruce Banner on your butt.<br>
<br>
Make the parents responsible and we'll see a huge wave of far better-behaved kids growing up in the next generation.<br>

Well said bro, and I completely agree.<br>
<br>
As a kid (pre-teen) I leaned by fearing the belt more than I did by understanding any moral crap that my parents tried to instill.<br>
<br>
Heck, my first religious experiences were at the foot of my bed, pray that mom would get amnesia before dad got home.<br>
<br>
Once I got into my teens, I came to understand the moral concepts... but it was a healthy fear of a good old fashioned pants-droppin-arse-tanning that made me be good early on.<br>
<br>
Without discipline, there is chaos.  KIds need to learn at an early age that there are consequences for doing things wrong... just as much as there are for doing things right <p><center>

ROFL, I never grew up fearing any belt or anything like that... My parents never hit me and I think I'm fine.  I never got in too much trouble (well, no more than the average kid ;p) and again, I grew up fine.<br>
<br>
What you basically said was that kids should live with a &quot;healthy fear&quot; of getting hit if they do something wrong.  Well sir I'm sorry to say that there are other more civilized ways that are just &quot;as healthy&quot;.  I'm not bashing you or your parents or anything for the ways in which you were raised, im simply stating that theres ALWAYS another way that produces at least equal results. <p><center><map name="SigMap">

Mont.  There are ways to enstill permanent morals and social guidelines in a child's mind.  Giving them a &quot;time-out&quot; for a felony-type of crime is NOT going to act as a punishment.  The problem with people NOT hitting their kids is that the kids don't fear anything anymore.  If they get in trouble, the parents raise their voices and give them some menial politically correct punishment.  So what?  Getting grounded these days means you get to stay in your room and play computer games all day long.  Or watch cable TV.  Or surf chat rooms on the Internet.  It's not punishment - its a slight discomfort to their social lives.   They will associate crime and punishment with not being able to watch &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; for a month.  Oh, my stars and garters.. what a travesty!!  <br>
<br>
When I see parents dealing with kids in a mall, I hear &quot;Billy, don't do that.. Billy, please stop... Billy, don't touch that... Billy, put that down.... Billy, come here... Billy, please come here... Billy, don't hit that little girl... Billy... Billy.. &quot;  Grrrr.<br>
<br>
I grind my teeth at stuff like that.  Give ME that little dipsh*t Billy for about 10 minutes.  The moment he hears his name called by his parents, trust me.. some cold sh*t will run down his spine as he freezes and waits for his parents' next command.  He WILL listen and he WILL obey.  That's what kids should do.  They must first learn how to behave before they learn how to misbehave.<br>
<br>
Then I'll take the parents aside and teach THEM how to &quot;negatively motivate&quot; when it is appropriate.  There's nothing wrong with a beating now and then, as long as it's justified.  And whoa be the fuking parent who tells ME that they disapprove of my hitting the child.  I LOVE getting those mutterances under their breath.... And they think that my hearing ain't perfect.<br>
<br>
&quot;Hey pal.. shut yer fuking piehole.. if someone gave YOU a little beating now and again when YOU were young, then you'd have learned by now to mind your own damned business.&quot;  That usually shuts them up pretty good.  Usually, I'm not mean to strangers.. but I give a great &quot;hairy eyeball&quot; when it is warranted.  That usually conveys enough 'do not mess with me' meaning to leave any verbal abuse out of the picture.<br>
<br>
You say that you &quot;grew up fine&quot;.  I'm sure you did.  And I'm sure many of us did.  I grew up fine, too.  But I remember more than a few moments in my life when I swore to God that &quot;I'd never do THAT again!&quot;.  Here's an example from my youth.  As a young teen, I once started a forest fire.  I'm not lying.   It was a blaze about 15 or 20 feet high, encompassing about half an acre.  It was burning full force for at least 10 min before the firemen just barely got it under control.  All because me and my friends were messing with fireworks one dry July afternoon.<br>
<br>
Well... let me tell you.  I caught such a beating that night from my mother.  She was a large-framed Italian woman - so naturally her weapon of choice was &quot;the big wooden spoon&quot; (+2 dam to 1H blunt weapon skill, I think) used to make all those infamous pasta sauces.  Not the little one she used to taste test, but the big one.  The.  Big.  One.  The one that she used when she wanted to kill Volkswagons.<br>
<br>
She broke it over... my... head.  Without even working up a sweat, she broke it over my head.  Try and break a wooden ANYTHING over your head.  Trust me.. it hurt so much my sister was even crying.  I saw spots for an hour.<br>
<br>
Moral to the story: I never - NEVER - messed with fireworks again.  Ever.  I still get headaches when I watch fireworks at the pier.<br>
<br>
Somethings, you take with you to your grave because your parents taught you to do things right.  It was their job and they did it well.<br>

Monty, when you mention hitting, I think that term needs to be clarified a wee bit.  PLease note that I am whole-heartedly against beatings per se (where limbs get broken, eyes get blackened, etc).<br>
<br>
Though I DO fully support bending yer kid over your knee and spanking the living hell out of them.<br>
<br>
Also note that I dont feel that you should ever hit a child out of anger.... but rather explain to them what they did wrong, and why it was wrong... and then start the punishment. <br>

It sounds to me like you guys have no clue the topic of this thread.  This kid was in high school... I dunno about you but by the time I was in high school I was like a foot taller than my mom~  nothing she could possibly do (if she had a reason to hit me, which she didnt) woulda even phased me.<br>
<br>
This kid was a teenager, you cant bend a teenager over your knee... and if this kid was a Senior (Assuming age 18+) you couldnt even do it legally.<br>
<br>
You all go on and on and on about spanking and hitting and beating when this doesnt, or probably doesnt, even apply to this circumstance.<br>
<br>
------<br>
And if your mom/dad did still bend you over their knee when you were in high school... well, I just find that very funny. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uaidiene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidiene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Hot woodelf</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/6/02 2:35:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=301.topic&index=81>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OT- Another School Shooting</span><hr size=1> I think the point was...did his mom actually parent him when he was little...the assumption being that she did not or he would not have turned out like he did. I believe this is true most of the time. What you do... what you teach your child when they are small is what dictates what they do when they are older. I teach 14 year olds. It is obvious when you meet the parents which parents parented and which didn't and still don't. 9 out of 10 times I can tell you that by the way a student acts long before I meet their parents. The teenager that was brought up well as a child is rarely the teenager who gets into trouble with the school authorities and the law. Every year, in every group of 8th graders we get at least one parent who basically spoiled...let run...their child and now all of a sudden does not know what to do with this teenager who is in trouble all the time...we all want to say, &quot;well, duh..did you think he would raise himself??? stupid woman (man)&quot;. <br>
<br>
I have read a lot of this thread, and skipped a lot too...but I would have to say that spanking has its place in discipline for some children and some situations and saying you just don't believe in spanking, if you have a child with the right personality, could lead to disaster. Most children, the ones who respond to spanking, who are not spanked will only turn out to be spoiled brats. THen there are those who will be kicked out for writing death threats in their journals. We get one a year. <br>
<br>
I am lucky so far and my daughter responds well to a dissaproving look and telling her she isn't being nice. She wants more than anything to be nice. She is four. Do I think this will always work? No, not likely. Do I think this is the only way to discipline her? Not at all. If she does something that might hurt her or something more serious than saying something mean to her cousin, she deserves more discipline. The trick is to match the discipline to the action...and the discipline to your child's personality (if it doesn't bother them it isn't discipline...to realize that it is your JOB to raise these kids even when it is not convenient or fun. ESPECIALLY when it is not convenient or fun, for this is when your child is learning the most.<br>
<br>
If you do your job when your children are little, most likely it won't be your child suspended for threatening teachers or other students, it won't be your child arrested for taking a gun to school, it won't be your child dead from a gunshot wound to the head after killing students and teachers at school. <br>

Do you know? If you're going to assert that hitting is the way to keep kids from doing this stuff, don't you think that's kind of an important detail? Any argument for discipline being a factor in these (teenage) children's criminal behavior is going to need some evidence other than &quot;such and such worked on me, look how I turned out&quot; or &quot;I do this to my kids, blah blah.&quot; That's anecdotal evidence, and it doesn't hold up.

If we found that school shooters were by and large spanked as children, would that change anything? Honestly, we don't have the answers, and the answers are probably a lot more complicated than we'd like them to be, and sweeping generalizations (especially unfounded ones) just don't seem to lead to much of anything.<br>

What's going on here is a healthy conversation being enjoyed by both participants and onlookers alike.  No, we're not the all-knowing, omnipotent beings who can deem something &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; at the drop of a hat... we're just offering to each other our own opinions of the topic.  And as everyone knows, opinions are never wrong.<br>
<br>
And getting back to the topic-at-large, Trab.. I think it's safe to assume that parental guidance (be it either passive or aggressive) is critical in forming ANY child's sense of morality.  A lack of it allows for too much of a course deviation from the rest of the civilized herd - the child's sense of right and wrong could be horribly and possibly dangerously skewed.<br>

------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Of course. But there is a strong sentiment here of &quot;all these kids need is a good whooping,&quot; which is really hard to get behind. Parents obviously have a huge role in their children's lives, that can't be denied. What I can't agree with is that there is some magical sort of &quot;right way&quot; and &quot;wrong way&quot; to raise your children. That school violence can be attributed 100% to &quot;wrong&quot; parenting. Children grow up in crack houses and turn out ok. Kids that have the perfect parents turn out messed up. Some kids are psychologically messed up in ways that aren't anybody's &quot;fault.&quot; Kids are resilient enough to where small variations in parenting methods are not going to result in a completely corrupted set of morals. If you look at things across cultures, we don't all raise children the same way. Some cultures are much stricter, some are much looser, but we don't see a culture of axe murderers out there because the kids were raised a certain way. I tend to think that unless you outright abuse your children, your kids are probably going to turn out decent. Not to say that parents aren't influential, they are, but children, by nature, are highly adaptive.<br>
<br>
Although school violence is highly publicized, the majority of children don't commit violent crimes. There are far more normal children out there than there are killers, far too many for &quot;lack of discipline&quot; to be a reasonable answer. I would be interested to see case studies on these children and see what kind of homes they were raised in, but I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't any obvious answers to be found in the parenting, something you could point to and say &quot;oh, well there's where they went wrong,&quot; unless it was a case of obvious abuse (not talking spankings here. I think there are more effective ways of raising children, but I'm talking about heavy beatings, verbal abuse, sexual abuse, the kind of stuff that is severely damaging to a child's psyche). Thinking otherwise may make us feel better about how we raise our children, make us feel a certain sense of security, but in the end parents who raise their children in the best possible way still sometimes end up with the worst possible outcome. <br>

<br>
When they visit their Aunt Kiki, however, they are well behaved and listen to the first &quot;No&quot; I tell them. Why? Because I will take my hand (my hand, not any boards, belts or other foreign objects) to their behinds. So, between my sister and I, they know the difference between right an wrong. They just know that with their mom it doesn't matter.<br>

My vote: Spanking when necessary<br>
<br>
<br>
*note* I've not had to spank them much.

You don't know that they didn't spank/hit them when they were little.<br>
<br>
As much as you and I would both like to believe that the world is perfect... its not.  For all you know these kids/this kid grew up perfectly fine up until high school and maybe then they turned bad... maybe they got mixed in with the wrong crowd or somethin...<br>

I cant speak for others... but for me, Spankings were something that were the result of me doing something bad.  And yeah... at 5-6 years old... Dad's hand was colossal.<br>
<br>
I learned at an early age to think before acting... and my idea of right/wrong was basically a question of whether or not an action would result in Dad removing his belt and making a most distinctive snapping sound as he headed to the bedroom.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately... I wasnt a quick learner... and yep.... I deserved each and every whoopin... and yep... it made me into the person I am today... someone who will thank my parents for raising me with the morals I have (which I believe to be good).<br>

Spanking i guess is good, its a personal prefrence to the parent really. <br>
         The main thing i see alot nowadays, is Parents beating the sh*t outta there kids, and not showing them any love or anything of that nature. If ya use that kind of punishment on your child and totally treat him/her like trash, you should be ashamed of yourself. To me, this is one of the main things that breeds these kind of teenagers. Its worse then just plain out neglecting them. Dont get me wrong, your gonna put fear in thier eyes, but they are gonna grow to hate you and not show you a ounce of respect. IMO you have to show 10 times more love for your child, then the seriousness of a spanking.<br>
Not accousing anyone or anything, that is just what i think of this.<br>
Anyways, get your kids into a sport or something, when i was in high school i didnt have time to even get in trouble really, i played baseball, water skied, played a few MUDS etc. (untill senior year &quot;whistle&quot;). At any high school theres tons of clubs and sports and extracurricular stuff for people to do, then to go home and hate thier parents. As far as the black clothing thing..I never was a big fan of it, i was in 11th grade when it was really getting big, the whole black clothing dirty goth look whatever you wanna call it. Never saw it as attractive, the kids that chose to wear that kinda stuff really didnt seem to care about thier bodies much, had peircings, tatoos etc, bad personal hygiene, shrug, they are probably all diffrent around the country. I guess its a personal thing but when you ask one of them they are like.. &quot;thats how i express myself&quot;. I was always just like ok, i guess everyones diffrent, whatever. Worst thing I thought was the boys (young adults 16-17) with black makeup and fingernails, always seemed pretty messed up to me.<br>
      Anyways kinda difted off there, but, too many parents abuse thier children these days, in this day and age, not saying spanking is abuse, it is fine, but its a 2 way bridge.<br>
Prime example:<br>
 <br>
Mom gets home from a 10 hour stressfull work shift. Is tired, has a headache, cant think straight etc (weve all been there).  Mom gets a call from neighbor saying her son broke thier window and they want money to fix it. atiredstressedoutpissedoffmom_001 finds her son and spanks him. Neither talk for the rest of the day, next day son is pissed off and home alone, then ignores the mom when she gets home, rinse repeat. <br>
Just a few thoughts, sorry for the long post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
