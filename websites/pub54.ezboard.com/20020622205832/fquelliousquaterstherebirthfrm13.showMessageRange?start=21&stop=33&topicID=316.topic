After Episode 1, I realized how stupid it all was...now it's all a lot more enjoyable and I have a lot less useless knowledge in my head - though admittedly a lot of that space was probably taken up by EQ info, so I'm not sure if that's an improvement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uafropyrm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>afroPyrm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/17/02 1:07:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=316.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Episode 2 sucked</span><hr size=1> Ok first of all, I am not a Star Wars fan.  I don't even know the character names aside from the ones that are in every other scene.  I don't know the name of the guy who's ass Yoda completely OWNED.  But, I do know this:  this was one amazing movie.<br>
<br>
&quot;But when it came down to the body of the film - script and acting - it fell short.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have to disagree.  The script has been written for years, the basics of it anyway, and it is hands down <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> the</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> most original fantasy story ever.  It makes J.R.R. Tolkien look like an amateur in fantasy.  The acting .. well, Samuel L. and the girl who played Padame (name escapes me) are both well known and well respected actors.  The only cheesy line was the first one in the movie.<br>
<br>
&quot;flame me for being an artsy film critic &quot;<br>
<br>
I have one thing to say about this.  If you have even wasted your time watching the Mummy or Wild Things, then in no way, shape or form would I EVER consider you to be a) artsy or b) a respectable amatuer movie critic.  Sorry.   Try watching Pi, Momento, Kids, Gummo, Requiem for a Dream or something along those lines if you want to see an arty flick, bud.<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought Yoda's litesabre battle was pretty lame&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok.  Now you are just out of your mind.  That was one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen, aside from Crouching Tiger fights on the trees.<br>
<br>
You are just mad because you felt betrayed after Star Wars 1 didn't meet your expectations.  Yes, many of us were let down by it, mainly due to Jar Jar Fuckface, but this was an excellent recovery.<br>
<br>
As a side note, did anyone know that N*Sync tried to get parts in the movie?  From what I hear they almost got in.  Can you imagine the mass suicides of Star Wars junkies across the nation if that actually happened?<br>

The basics of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> story</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have been written for years - each script/screenplay has only been written as the individual movies have moved into production.  There's a big difference there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> and it is hands down the most original fantasy story ever. It makes J.R.R. Tolkien look like an amateur in fantasy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Whether or not it is the most original I don't really care, though I would put the originality of concepts on par with Tolkien.  To say that it makes Tolkien look like an amateur is blasphemy.  First and foremost, we're talking about an author vs. a filmmaker - two completely different playing fields.  Tolkien's world is just as rich in creativity and detail as Lucas' galaxy.  You're entitled to your opinion, but I don't think this is a fair comparison.  And just for the record, I thought the first LotR movie was fantastic.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have one thing to say about this.

Lol, so if I like artsy films I'm not allowed to watch anything else?  That's ridiculous, if for no other reason than you can never account for the tastes of your roommates.  I never claimed to be an amateur movie critic or to know everything about this subject matter.  What I meant by my statement was that you shouldn't berate me for holding Star Wars to a standard for artistic value as well as entertainment value.  And by the way, I've seen three of the four movies you listed.<br>
<br>
Yoda's litesabre battle - this is a matter of opinion.  I thought it looked fake and silly since it was a computer toon flipping around in the air making moves against a live actor that didn't look like he was fighting anything when his part was shot.  Episode 1 - Obi Wan, Qui Gon, and Darth Maul - <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> that</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was &quot;one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You are just mad because you felt betrayed after Star Wars 1 didn't meet your expectations.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Please don't attribute thoughts or emotions to me that I have at no point expressed.  Episode 1 didn't underwhelm me as much as this one did.  While I thought it could have been better, I actually thought it was pretty decent, though obviously more of a kids movie.  This one should have been a lot better just because this portion of the story is more interesting - and I'll say this once again, I thought the plot/story was set up very well.  The actors had the potential, but the script and acting (therefore the directing?) didn't deliver IMO.<br>
<br>
N'Sync: I shuddered at the thought of it...the rumor I heard was that Lucas actually had given them roles as Jedi.<br>
<br>
Filch: Did I expect too much?  Possibly...but I would rather have high expectations that are met only some of the time than have low expectations that are met all of the time.  It's just the way I am. <p><center>

You seem to have to keep brining up the New Computer Animated toys and how much you hate them... I don't think it is the story or the plot or the cheesey one liners that really bother you. I think it is this movies total lack of Muppets. I would have to agree with you there. Every movie could use more muppets, screw all these cool new animations we should just use puppets and midgets in suits for everything. And screw color movies for that matter! I say bring back black and white. And sound? Bah, who needs it just play a little bit of the movie then flash some words on the screen like they did back in the day. <p>[60 Rogue] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=91273">Filch McPain</a> Barbarian of Quellious <BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/17/02 7:33:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=316.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Episode 2 sucked</span><hr size=1> So you don't want to see another opinion? Too bad. I'm going to give it a shot while I suck on lemonade and slurp Ramen noodles.<br>
<br>
I'm not a Star Wars geek. I just like good movies. What bothered me were the love scenes. I'm a sap for mushy scenes. I'll cry watching <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Fried Green Tomatoes</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Steel Magnolias</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> no matter how many times I see it. But the &quot;tender moments&quot; in EII were so lacking, so artificial. ::hits her chest to dislodge a moldy blackberry:: I have to hand it to Hayden Christensen for keeping a straight face--and those strings playing in the background...overkill! (That's not despair, Anakin. It's lust in your crotch, boy!) I'm not sure if Lucas or whoever wrote the script did it with a 12 and under audience in mind. Heavy suggestions wouldn't have made it better, either. The dialogue between Amidala and Anakin was forced and childish for two prodigies. Except for Amidala's ever-present parted lips *begging* to be kissed while refuting Anakin's advances, sort of a betrayal of her feelings for him and yet so obvious it was crude, body language could be measured in proximity more than facial expressions. Maybe the actors weren't allowed to flesh the characters out if Lucas felt it deviated one inch from his vision.<br>
<br>
Other than rolling my eyes each time the camera turned to the stiff pair (I wanted to take their pulse), waiting for the scenes to get over and done with, I liked it. The scenery was beautiful and detailed, the action very nice, and Yoda gave everyone a laugh. I wonder if Lucas intended people to take Yoda seriously as a warrior. If he did it failed miserably.<br>

Wow Stylee, you're very talented at taking something out of context!  If you take the first one within its entire sentence, these two statements are not mutually exclusive.  I will rephrase them to make this more clear: Everyone is an amateur film critic to a certain extent since we can all post our opinions here.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Yea, you are right I would have much rather seen them use a muppet on a string..&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Sorry, but CGI characters still lack a large degree of realism, especially when used as main characters such as Jar Jar in Ep.1 but even more so Yoda here in Ep.2.  Frank Oz' work is amazing and I do prefer it.  They crossed a significant line when they not only made a fight scene between two characters almost entirely of CGI, but one of those two principle characters in the scene as well.  <br>
<br>
Now I know they couldn't possibly do an action scene with Yoda using a muppet, and this was the tradeoff.  I accept this; I just don't think it turned out all that well.  Esmalyn put it best - it was funny as hell seeing Yoda walk in and do a lightsabre fight, but as an action/fight scene it was ridiculous.<br>

<br>
Im just curious what is used to determine the realism of a &quot;being&quot; that doesn't actually exist. Yoda doesn't exist. We have no real Yoda to compare this one to. We cannot A-B movements of a live Yoda and a CGI Yoda for accuracy.<br>
<br>
Why nitpick the actions of characters in what is a fantasy world? The fact that the movements are &quot;alien&quot; to us, or &quot;seem fake&quot; is only due to the limitations we put on ourselves in making an attempt to compare it to real life.<br>

Thats the enjoyment of fantasy films, and worlds, and creatures. They do not have to be human-like or lifelike...in fact, they arent supposed to be.<br>
<br>
Let them break the rules.<br>
It is a fantasy world you know...<br>
<br>
Imaginations never hurt anyone, you know. Using some of the logic Ive seen in this thead, I wonder what some of you guys (And gals) childhoods must have been like. I can just imagine playing &quot;War&quot; with you for example and then arguiing that just because I pointed my finger at you and went &quot;boom&quot;,  you arent dead.<br>
<br>
Loosen up, loosen you mind, enjoy thinking outside of the lines, it really is quite relaxing and enjoyable. Otherwise, I fear you will be suing someone for shooting a spitball at one of your kids someday....<br>

I'm tired and delirious. When people buy the DVD they're going to fast-forward to Yoda, bust a fart laughing, and turn it off. I'm being a grump. Go to hell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ulorddrunkeness.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Drunkeness</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=Red>Admin</font><br>God Of Beer</span><br>  Posts: 603<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(5/18/02 1:39:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=316.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Episode 2 sucked</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When people buy the DVD they're going to fast-forward to Yoda, bust a fart laughing, and turn it off<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
