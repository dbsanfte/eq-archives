<br>
Why Catholic lore, you ask? It breaks the ice at parties. For instance, did you know that the office of the Inquisition was only abolished in the 50's? No kidding.<br>
<br>
I have, in my time, gone from hot-blooded atheism to slightly warm atheism to the knowledge that what I belive isn't worth another scar. I'm still saddened- and worried- when I find there are people out there who haven't figured that out yet.<br>

<br>
Sure, it's easy, damned easy, to bring up innumerable incidents of vile wrongs perpetrated in the name of, say, the Catholic church, but what of the good that would not have come to pass? Has there ever been ahy society born strictly of secular mores that survived the weight of history?<br>
<br>
The United States of America was formed by God-fearing colonists, mostly of European descent, and founded upon the principles inculcated from centuries of adherence to the various church doctrines. We can trace our modern morailty and legal code back through the ages to the Ten Commandments, aka Yahweh's Covenant with the Jews, aka the Big Stone Rulebook.<br>
<br>
Most of what is good and true about through the history of the various Arabic lands (and there is much, if you take the time to look), can be traced to Islam's incredible emphasis on learning, science, mathematics, etc, and, before that, Zoroarastrianism.<br>
<br>
The grandeurs of China would not be so grand without Confucianism (and they still hold to the teachings of The Master to this day). Japan would pale without the twins pillars of Shinto and Buddhism. India, and thus much of southron Asia would not exist cohesively (well, as cohesive as it is) without the Buddhas and the Brahmins, etc.<br>
<br>
Surely, without trying hard we can point out the flaws in these areas, in their belief systems, but are you all so blind to history and religion as to believe that there would be such concepts as good, evil, nationalism, morality, etc without religion?<br>
<br>
It appalls me that we have gone so decadent as a society as to reap and enjoy the fruits of religious men and women, and then to decry and spit on their beliefs while doing so.<br>
<br>
I advise you to read Nietzche's &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; if you want a beautiful example of the deconstruction of religion. Nietzche posits the &quot;priest&quot; produced, religion in some pre-history, in an attempt to devalue the attributes and advantages of the stronger, brutal warrior (&quot;ubermensch&quot;) castes. It makes much sense historically. The priest defeated the warrior by making the warrior's virtues (strength, bravery, sense of purpose, etc) into flaws (bullying, aggressiveness, bloodthirstiness, ruthlessness etc). I invite you afterwards to consider that we are now using the devaluation of virtue on the priest. We take the good qualities of religion and call them flaws, evils.<br>
<br>
I consider my own lack of faith to be a personal failing, and I will not be hypocrite enough to say that I am attempting to sway anyone to religion. I am merely asking that you give credit where credit is due.<br>
<br>
In closing, book burning of any sort I find personally abhorrent. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

<br>
I have no quarrel with religion on the whole. When faith is like a candle that illuminates the darkness, then that faith is a beautiful thing. A person who believes like that can change the world with a single word, and the actions of the many be damned.<br>
<br>
Faith that burns like the point of the sword is what I object to. When someone believes in something like that, they do not often opt to feel the point in their own stomach. This is where I have a quarrel with religion; it's too good at instilling THIS kind of faith, and not nearly good enough at the other kind.<br>
<br>
My favourite historical figure is St Francis of Assissi, because he had a simple and beautiful faith. I admire him for it, even if I myself don't share it. I often wish I could.<br>
<br>
Bulvai, there's no question in my mind that religions have done good in the past. But you cannot overlook the bad simply because they did good things as well. And I urge you to go through your history books, and take a hard (and objective) look. You may well be surprised what you find.<br>
<br>
And Bulvai... you may not have religion, but you seem to have faith. I, for one, find that to be more of a positive than a negative. Stick with it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I wholly agree with your splitting of religion into the dichotomy of the &quot;candle in the darkness&quot; and that which &quot;burns like the point of a sword&quot; (VERY eloquent manner of putting it, BTW), but religion is not the only thing what spawns such intense emotion. Admittedly, it is more common to see such devotion associated with religion than, say, accounting, but many human endeavours have produced zealots perfectly willing to slay their fellow man over some marginal notion.<br>
<br>
Examples would be politics, population pressure, love, lust, and the Granddaddy of them all, economics. If you can show me a war, I can show how it's root cause was economics or population pressure. All of them, and, yes, that includes the Crusades.<br>
<br>
The Crusades, for instance, started, prima faciae, as a fight to insure the safety of Christian pilgrims on the way to the Holy Land. Oddly enough, they concentrated primarily on the trade routes and only really got swinging when the locals started seriously raiding caravans and thus disrupting that trade. People still blame this war on the Catholic Church though...<br>
<br>
I do not seek to overlook the bad, merely wish to point out the good and to attempt to counter the natural tendency among those who despise religion to throw torches at the faithful while ignoring the value of the faith.<br>
<br>
As far as delving into my history books, while it is incisive, it is too late. I've a degree in Theology, religious studies, and Philosophy, and enough history work for a minor at least, if not a second degree. My main conclusion as to religion, wars, good and evil is simple: <br>
<br>
&quot;The collective intelligence of any group increases in inverse proportion to its' numbers.&quot;<br>
<br>
Religion doesn't start wars, people blame the war on the religious ex post facto. Perhaps it is because I have read the Quran in English instead of Arabic as it is meant to be read, but I've seen nothing in the teachings of Islam that told bin Laden or Al-Qaeda or whomever to kill 3000 Americans. Islam is not a kind religion, but it is not an evil one, yet bin Laden uses Islam as an excuse for his actions. To use the Harry Potter example, nothing in the Bible that I have seen (admittedly, Chrisitianity probably ranks as the religion I need the most further research into before I am comfortable discussing it in detail) advocates burning children's books. This fellow is one of many what ses the human faculty for interpretation to further his own version of what his personal world-view is. <br>
<br>
As an aside, if you really want to hurt your brain, do some research into Qaballah (Jewish magic), Theurgic Ritual (Christian magic), and high medieval alchemy (Christian magic/science &quot;scientia sacria&quot;, or Sacred Science). The Christian faith has quite the long history of magic =) <br>
<br>
As far as saying that I have faith, I thank you, my friend *bow*, as that is something I aspire to someday have. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>
