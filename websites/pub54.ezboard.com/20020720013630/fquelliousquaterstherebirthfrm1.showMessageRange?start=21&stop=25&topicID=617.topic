My. God.</span><hr size=1> I've never heard of bipolar schizophrenia...have heard of delusional, catatonic, paranoid... hmm, disorganized and a 'catch all' who's name i can't remember. I'll run and look it up as soon as I'm done typing here, as you advice. I'm assumining these are all just the billboard ones and, seeing as to the nature of schizophrenia, there's almost unlimited combinations of symptons one could reorganize and label.<br>
<br>
I don't believe that it's implausible that the author is schizophrenic, but i do believe it's pretty unlikely. Poe suffered from  depression but his books reflect much more exaggerated expressions of mental disorders. I'm not here, nor qualified, to make a mental diagnosis on a human being based on a 500 word essay... but i do think it's presumptious to call us ignorant based on our lack of expertise on one hard to spell psychotic disorder.<br>
<br>
Why do I think this is more of a reflection of a disorder than a disease actually suffered by the author? <br>
<br>
Well for starters it's been the coolest thing since fm radio for kids to pretend they are insane. Personally, this is a tad nutty to begin with. Since i've been playing EQ i've encountered numerous white lies ranging from false age, ethnicity, mental disorders, to suicides and physical harm done or taken. I'll give them my unquestioned nod of the head until they start demanding special attention based on these claims, at which point the 500 contradicting facts advice me to reserve my sympathy to the already multiple real life people whom i'm much more cabable of helping or atleast being there for.  I may not believe the specifics given as a cry for help, but i do still think many of these people need real help by real people, not a 'chat buddy'. I'm not the person for the job. I believe strongly in support nets, be they family (my chosen), friends or  clans (typical of teens and early 20's ), professionals (becoming more common with such disjointed and mobile social relationships). The net anonmity does provide a nice anonymous setting for therapy and venting, but i'm not a doctor, their friend, family or counselor..i take it with a grain of salt. Anything more could be more harmfull, in my opinion. From this point of view, it is not only unproductive of me, but pretty darn over reactive to jump at every piece of art or action the screams 'disturbed' and take an active stance based on it. People like to pretend they are crazier than they are. It's a form of expression in my opinion, some roleplaying into the dark sides of their mind that they can't quit grasp, so they imitate . In the long run i think they learn from it eventually and move on.<br>
<br>
I prefer to remain the audience, let it serve as educational, eye opener..whatever it does for people. I  love the way the author bothered with such slight details as changing the date format at the end to reflect eq time. I laughed because I had a dream where folks kept dying, and unlike other dreams, I wasn't as bothered by it because they would just 'respawn'. I laughed when his boss was talking to him and he didnt' hear a single word of it, because that's half my phone conversations while i'm playing eq.   If i was this players spouse, parent or friend, I may take the safer position and atleast question them, to their great embarassment. I doubt Jim Morrisson showed his poetry to his mother for the artistic criticism he wanted.<br>
<br>
And lastly I have to look at it as a project. I have only dated one borderline schizophrenic in my teens, and had a neighbour attempting out house living in my 20's. That's the extent of my exposure to the disease. On the other hand, I've read over 100 books with characters suffering from parrallel delusions, listened to thousands of songs and poems using the charactaristics, and seen atleast 50 movies with mental disorders as the demonic cause creating human monsters. The story reads to me alot more like budding goth art work  than any 'real' work that i have seen from schizophrenic , or even drug enduced, writings. The character seems schizophrenic, not the author. This in no way cheapens the reality of the disease, or it's tragic nature. Well, also i have to admit when i first read it i though he had a brain tumor rather than schizophrenia. The head aches, sensitivity to light, eye pain..all that stuff made me give him a pop media based diagnosis of psychotic behaviour brought on by a tumor. <br>
<br>
I do strongly advice people against seeking pshychological help or support online from eq friends. EQ is not exactly what i would consider a safe enviroment for vulnerable people. Predators can conceal themselves incredibly well. The level of 'caring' is incredibly flimsy, temporary, and unpredictable. People dehumanize each other in under 5 minutes if it suits their ego. No matter how sane or confident..nurturing...caring etc someone may sound, it is just not the place to turn to for anything other than venting. If anyone ever does feel that way, for crying outloud find a doctor or atleast advice a loved one so they may keep an eye on you, no matter how embarassing it may be.<br>
<br>
I advice the same for those who jump to help people. If you truely believe someone is this disturbed, don't contact them. Contact their support group. Do not endanger yourself by providing private information, for all you know it's a con to find someone who buys into their role play. Or worse, they truely are homicidal/suicidal and you end up making things worse through good intentions.<br>
