Periodically, some girl would come through the room.  Her name was Obsedianx, had /role on, was in guild 'New Alliance', and she conned red to a lvl 45.  Judging by the spells she cast, I would say she was a necro.  Apparently, she is somewhat famous on Quellious, and I was wondering if any of you could confirm.<br>
<br>
As she frequented our camp spot, I thought nothing of her presence - I figured she was chatting with someone in our group.  After a while, the frenzied popped, and our puller was pulling it.  At that time, Obsedianx came running through our room heading toward the frenzied spawn location.  2 frogs followed her.  I figured she had accidentally brought two frogs with her, so I began casting ITU on every member of our group (minus the puller, who could FD).  By the time I got to casting on myself, Obsedianx came back in, and FD'd.  She /ooc'd YEEEEEHAAAAAAA and immediately around 15 to 20 frogs came charging into our room.  Since I did not have ITU up, they all charged me.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, I got divine aura off, followed by a gate when the aura wore (channelled through the pummeling).  Unfortunately, some of the group's first reaction was to fight, and for those that did, ITU was dropped and they got slaughtered.<br>
<br>
I came back into LGuk to ask in /ooc what was going on, and several people replied back that Obsedianx was famous for timing the frenzied pop, taking out the group camping, and looting for the FBSS.  They said she had been doing it for the last year and the guides/GM's have not done anything about it.  I'm assuming this is because there is no incriminating evidence, just a YEEEHAAAAA.  Of course, none of our petitions were answered, as we had no hardcore evidence.<br>
<br>
I did a /who all on their guild, and sent a tell to the highest level PC I saw.  He claimed to not know of Obsedianx's actions, and I have no reason not to believe him.  So, I asked if I could talk to the leader of the guild about the incident.  It turns out, Obsedianx _is_ the leader of 'New Alliance'.  So that obviously was not going to help the cause.<br>
<br>
Do any of you have any experience with this person?  I assume the only recourse for this is to move to a zone where she is not present.  That's a shame, I really like fighting down there.<br>

Avoid at all costs because she never seems to get in trouble despite GMs watching anyway. I've been in the same Guk scenario and you know what? A GM -was- watching and nothing seemed to happen anyway...she either didn't bother to do it while they were around surveying, or for some reason the GM never saw it while they were there watching us get trained and a YEEEEHHAAAA came over OOC.<br>
<br>
If Obsedianx is in the Arena zone, leave there. She hangs out near the entrance to the pvp section, and when people are in there, drops a high level necro dot on you by just taking one step in, then takes a step back out so you can't get her back.<br>
<br>
If at any point you see her in either Guk or Arena, or pretty much anything with a decent camp in it, leave. Its not worth the trouble.<br>

Using the search feature of this forum, I was able to pull up 2 other threads on her.  Yet those threads mentioned there are numerous other threads on the girl.  How might I  pull up these older threads?  I'm interested in hearing all of her tactics, so that I may avoid or defuse.<br>

I don't have a large circle of friends, as this is my first char, but I have made sure to notify all 30 /friends to avoid her and her guild &quot;New Alliance&quot;.  No rezzes, no grouping, no buffing, no raiding, etc.<br>

PS: Frankly, I'm quite disappointed that the actions of Fansy were able to change the rules on a no-rules server, yet this little package of joy continues to degrade the quality of a play-nice-policy server. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaraddorghoulbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garaddor Ghoulbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/10/02 3:41:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=388.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Obsedianx</span><hr size=1> Its all about which wanker GM is running the show on what server.

God, I hate folks who get off on the misery of others this way. Total waste of brain matter if you ask me. She/He is the type of person who used to have to tie a pork chop around her/his neck to get the dog to even play with her/him (god I know that saying is old but its still a classic...lol!). <p>Garaddor Ghoulbane

i do not believe this is the original owner of the account, because a RL friend of mine used to be friends with her.  while he may not be the best judge of character, i think i can safely say he would never associate himself with this person.<br>
