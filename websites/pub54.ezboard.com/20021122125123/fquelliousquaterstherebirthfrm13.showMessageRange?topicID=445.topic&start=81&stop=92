Personally I feel that if Hitler had honored his promise to Chamblerain, for a time, and thus been able to devote his full resources to the east he could have succeeded, despite the Russian winter. But it's an impossible question to answer now.<br>
<br>
But really. he should have left Russia alone until he consolidated europe, or at least vice versa. The Japanese attacking pearl harbor was a grave error too. All in all a lot of extreme shortsightedness.<br>

<br>
Montyy was comparing Russia's technology and economy to China's technology and economy, Germany wasn't in his equation.<br>
<br>
To say that Russia did not have the technology is to completely ignore the theatre of operations in Russia. Russian weather is nasty. Planes don't like it at all. Fighter battles are tough. Russians planes and pilots still stank, but they had lots of them. Where a land war is won or lost in Russia is tanks, troops, and weather. Weather is an accepted and agreed upon factor. We all know that the Russian winter is there most effective defense against invasion.<br>
<br>
Troops and tanks are a fun point. When it was introduced, the T-34 was one of the best tanks in the war. The later JS tanks were damned near equal to anything the Germans could field, and the Russians had em in droves. The Guard units were nearly as well trained and motivated as the real SS units (not the jack-off SS creeps that persecuted the Jews, the real SS units that held the designation due to combat efficiency). The PPSHg-41 and 43 were both highly effective SMG's and the Guard units used them in a stuttering fire-and-advance pattern that is still practiced today by modern SF troops. The Guard were, hands down, some of the best city fighters around. <br>
<br>
With the Russians, the problem is not the quality of their upper end units, it was that they had so much at the bottom that it wrecked the curve. The Germans were tight, competent, well-equipped, and driven. Thus they succeeded against incredible odds. The Russians were tenacious, diffidently equipped, and had nasty winters, thus they survived when no one thought they would.<br>
<br>
I heartily disbelieve that Hitler would've been able to roll over Russia given the way things turned out. As someone mentioned about, the only scenario in which it is plausible is if Hitler had either consolidated Europe before hitting Russia, or left it alone during. <p>a_Bearhat01<BR>

<br>
It wasn't happening that way, and it didn't happen that way in the end the Russians lost TONS of poorly trained soldiers 1st defending the slaughter that the germans where handing to them, and secondly when germany started the multiple front war. Thin to win is a strategy that works well in the game of risk... didn't work well for germany in the end.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the clue ripostes ...<br>
<br>
I stated that the russians would have won out in the end but it would have been A VERY VERY VERY VERY long time for the russians to win if the US had not stepped in. In fact, Russia would have won a 2 front war, cause by the time russia would have regrouped Japan would have been knocking down China's door with nothing standing in its way to get to russia, and the japanese were VERY well trained and VERY well armed. I agree Russia would have probably pulled it out in the end, but it wouldn't have been near the pwnage that the germans had on them in the begining... russia's front door fell like a dress on prom night, and only the cold of winter was gonna keep Stalin from taking it in the a$$...<br>
<br>
If the Japanese would have gone after Russia instead of US, Russia would probably be the world super power that we are today WW2 set us up to be the heros of the future not just the war. WW2 set us up to put the Russian Economy to shame... <br>

<br>
This was not the phrase I was referring to. Still, it's not all that off. Russia took it in the shorts for a good while, but their comeback was great. Germany had no way to sustain their momentum. Eventually the Russian war machine would've really wound itself up good and they just have sooooo much machine to wind up.<br>
<br>
&quot;russia's front door fell like a dress on prom night, and only the cold of winter was gonna keep Stalin from taking it in the a$$...&quot;<br>
<br>
True that. The problem with Russia is that it is a looooong way from the front door to anything important. It's so damned big! To say that Hitler was stupid for trying is one of the big understatements of all time.<br>
<br>
&quot;If the Japanese would have gone after Russia instead of US, Russia would probably be the world super power that we are today WW2 set us up to be the heros of the future not just the war. WW2 set us up to put the Russian Economy to shame...&quot;<br>
<br>
Not sure how to take this one. Can you expound on this a bit? You're saying that if Japan had assaulted Russia instead of the US, Russia would be where we are now? I'm not getting it.<br>

<br>
Sigh time for another history lesson.  Battle of Britain occured from 30th July - 31st October 1940, we should have lost *arrogant???* but the Nazi's messed up and directed their attacks to London following us returning fire on Berlin with a pitiful amount of aircraft.  <br>
<br>
Should Britain have lost that war, and the U.S. became involved in the normal timescale ... please tell me where the hell they could land.  I would be mightily interested.  Then the next step, where the hell could they get supplies from ???? Africa ? <br>
<br>
They were at war too oh and the Nazis would have had complete control of the N.Atlantic european shores because of superior Naval power. <br>
<br>
And Russia ... more precisely Stalingrad they were halted at.  Do people who actually thought that Russia won the war here realise that most of the Russians did not have guns ?  The Germans absolutely h-a-m-m-e-r-e-d the Russians.  <br>
<br>
They were in fact around 20-30 feet away from victory when the weather front set in.   The Nazis were not equipped for the cold winter, their guns froze, artilary backfired, tanks immobizlied and froze. Foot soldiers were not equipped for the winter.  This allowed the Russians to circle Stalingrad and circle the Nazi's.  Hitler's soldiers had no suppliess for about 6 months and they got down to firing around 1 bullet per day per soldier.   Finally they made a break for it and around 3% of the overall german fighting force survived.  This was against Hitler's orders who insisted that they hold Stalingrad due to some emotional attachment with the town.<br>
<br>
They were still fairly strong on the Western front at this time too.  Allied forced werent exactly pushing the Nazis back that much, losing ground gaining ground.  Bombing supply routes etc.  <br>
<br>
If in the event that Europe had been captured all Western Europe held, some of Africa - Japan taking out Pearl Harbour (9th December 1941), you seriously think that America would not have fallen to superiority at that time ? <br>
<br>
Imagine getting hit on both sides of the country by land forces better equipped, better trained and more experienced that your own.  <br>
<br>
Hitler also said he wouldn't bother England, but when England started to question his morals he attacked Britain, so by saying that America would not have been touched is almost laughable.  <br>
<br>
Japan + Germany = allied.  Japan attacks U.S., U.S need to cut supplies to Japan, U.S goes for Germany to cut those supplies.  Stands to reason.<br>
<br>
If it had been anything but ecomonics that stood in the way, why did the U.S take 5 years before they became involved ? It was money and ecomonic power, nothing more nothing less.  <br>

The wasn't enough pulblic support to back a declaration of war.  I'm sure the American people didn't like what was going on, but still most felt that it was none of their concern (ignorant I know) You have to remember that no one knew the exact extent of Hiltler's madness (holocaust and such) until much later.  Had the American people known about the mass execution of the Jews in Europe I'm 100% sure we woul dhave become involved much longer.<br>
<br>
As it is, we were involved behind the scenes for a very long time providing England with finincial support, which the administration at the time could get away with, because we as a people always want to help out, but don't wanna get our hands dirty (sad I know heh) It wasn't until the attack on Pearl Harbor that we were able to muster enough public support to declar war.  <br>
<br>
Should we have entered the war earlier? yeah we prolly should have....but those were different times, it was a generation that lost millions to trench fighting in Europe in WW1 and was not anxious to send their children off to relive their parents nightmare.<br>
