That has to be a lie. I've been on lots and I've seen reavers drop once.<br>

<br>
You are saying that 100*1 is bigger than 10*10 because 100 is bigger than 10. The spawn rate or the drop rate alone are not significant. The product of the two is what is important. How many come into the world in any time frame is what is important.<br>
<br>
This determines <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> supply</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
How how desired they are is determined by relative obsolesence of the epic and the number of people that need it. For Warriors obsolescence is relatively high and number of people wanting it is relatively low. For Druids/Ranger obsolescence is low and number of people wanting it is high (two classes, one of which is the most popular in the game).<br>
<br>
This determines <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> demand</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Those two together determine value, which is dynamic.<br>
<br>
As for Green Scales specifically, before MB was nerfed, it was actually much easier for a Warrior to get a green scale than a druid/ranger to get a reaver. All he had to do was camp there until Sev popped. He could get his guild.. if they were available.. or get burners if not. Guilds and burners would always come because of the secondary loots (to the warrior) and the minimal time they must expend to get them. The warrior did the waiting alone. Even now the warrior can still camp it and get his guild, or, if not have an ok shot at putting together a pickup raid. This requires some knowlege of organizing a raid.. but it's not that hard to do, and not that hard to find people to kill dragons. The main risk is someone you ask getting their own people and ganking it.<br>
<br>
And you are dreaming. Sev is almost NEVER camped except right after a patch. And not always even then. That's the reality. VoR camps him sometimes. Lonin camped him. A couple of others.<br>
<br>
Constrast this with a rng/dru getting people to go to CoM. It's damned hard. XP sucks. Loot sucks. It takes a LOT of time. You get tired of asking and feel guilty.<br>

<br>
Well Montyy I have news for you. They still can't. They never will.<br>
<br>
*I* think they need to do something to address THAT. Make them all nodrop and combined. Make them all timesinks or PH, like RF is now. Nerf high level people totally from those encounters.<br>
<br>
But you don't want any of that. Most people don't. Because you don't REALLY have anything against farming.<br>
<br>
You just have something against someone <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> else</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> farming.<br>
<br>
See, the basic truth is:<br>
<br>
You are a liar.<br>
<br>
Now you MAY be an equal opportunity liar. You may be lying to yourself as well as everyone else, but you are a liar.<br>
<br>
Your actions show your real thoughts on farming and selling epic drops.<br>
<br>
You never wanted a real solution to the issue of farming dragons. You wanted MB nerfed. You SAID it was about &quot;content&quot; and &quot;preserving it for midlevel people&quot;.. but you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> didn't</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> fix</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that. You said &quot;Nerf MB!&quot;. But the MB nerf did nothing to solve the problem, in fact, Wizards were killing dragons the very day of the patch. Took more but still, no Wizard needs any dragon drop for their own epic. They were still 'farming'.<br>
<br>
The math is simple. Less than a dozen Sorcerors can kill any dragon if they are willing to accept some rezzes after. And thats just a zerg tactic. It will get more sophisticated. It will only get worse as people level to 65.<br>
<br>
You never cared about people selling epic drops, you sell them. You never cared about 'preserving midlevel <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> content</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'. You just wanted MB nerfed, you didn't care about farming, because you, yourself are in a position to farm some things.<br>
<br>
And do.<br>

Increased availability increases the chances of you getting your desired drop. This is the law of probability.&quot;<br>
<br>
Except in your example, after the first draw its gone down to 1 in 8.  The conditions in the second attempt were not the same.  You have not increased availability, you have decreased the odds that you will NOT get the card you want.  Yes, you can keep drawing and eventually you'll get the winning card, even if you add cards to always make the chance 1 in 9, that's the law of averages.  But unless you add an additional card to represent another jade reaver, availability remains the same.  <br>
<br>
Kailynn states:  &quot;And unless you just want to assume we're lying you can throw out the idea that Sev drops a scale every time cause he sure as hell doesnt.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm fairly sure he doesn't and I never said he did.  In my direct firsthand experience though, he has.  But again, I'm not trying to equate my experience in that regard as valid and binding in all cases like some appear to be doing in regards to the jade reaver in a smokescreen.  I can tell you right now, you can do two full clearings of black reavers in a day and NOT see a single JR drop.  And I know I'm not an exception to that either.<br>
<br>
Montyy states:  &quot;admit aegloism helps, but is not necessary in the least&quot;<br>
<br>
No but it does further entrench your chances of success compared to a non-twinked group. <br>
<br>
&quot;you seem to base your aurguement on the basis that jade reaver drops are 'rare' becuase the people who need them are unable to get a group together to kill them.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, the rarity of a drop has been 'your' defense for selling an epic drop after blasting manaburn wizards for doing so.  I've never said someone does not have the right to kill a mob and distribute the loot as they see fit because another group might want to.<br>
<br>
Nor have I said that jade reaver drops are rare because people can't get a group together to kill them.  What you're twisting out of context is that I've said that it's unrealistic to think a group is going to stay in City of Mist around the clock until a jade reaver drops.<br>
I have also said that what's trivial to group of twinks and access to spells above their average group level is not necessarily going to be trivial to a full group of people with lower quality gear.  <br>
<br>
You're sounding like a broken record.<br>

Most controversial ability in  Everquest history I say..<br>
<br>
anyway.. The definition of a greedy manaburner to me is..<br>
<br>
1. a person who leaves a raid CONSTANTLY to burn a dragon and comes back<br>
<br>
2. a person who sells the loot and knows willingly that one of his guildmates needs it and doesn't give nor sell it to him<br>
<br>
3. Goes to burn raids constantly when guildmates needs his help.<br>
<br>
4. Gets rich and gloats about it to everyone he knows.<br>
<br>
A greedy manaburner is not necessarily a person who burns a lot or has gotten rich which is the misconception.<br>
<br>
Woow.. At first I thought you were heading into sarcasm but its nice to know some people are willing to back down when they find out the truth instead of mud slinging like some people usually do.  It shows some maturity some people lack.. Anyway.. Its probably a mixture of the two but I hypothesized that Verant was thinking of their new content more than their old.. Its more of a &quot;2 birds with one stone&quot; deal.<br>
<br>
I still don't think manaburn should have been nerfed.. It punished the people who didn't abuse it but I guess &quot;1 bad apple ruins the bunch&quot; <p><center>

But i'm gonna  try and bring a  few things to  out in i  hope a  new light.......<br>
<br>
  There are  6 reavers in  com, all of which are roughly 2 hour respawns.. When you kill a  reaver there is a chance another reaver will spawn. I have seen  7 reavers spawn back to back from killing the 1st reaver, is this the max limit of how many reavers can spawn?  I honestly do not know... and  then other times either nothing respawns or a ghost does......<br>
  I have killed reavers  with only 1 group and as many as 4 groups.  Gear isn't a  factor so much as level is. Being as i am a warrior i was way more effiecent tanking the reavers  at lvl 60 then i was at lvl 50-59 and mind you gear wise i kept the same armor when i dinged 60 as i had at lvl 50,  only upgrades was to my weapons. Why you ask?  Because i wanted to see what if any difference AC has in exp groups as i gained lvls.... From 50-55 i killed in DL/KC   from 55-60 i killed exclusively in   Velks....I grouped fairly often with lower lvl warriors who had Better gear yielding a higher  AC but my higher  lvl  still made me the  More  efficient tank despite having less AC. This  was  MY experience and may or may not mean a DAMN thing to anyone of you.... so with that said....<br>
<br>
Being able to kill  6  reavers , basically anytime you wanna get a raid up for them  verse  Killing  sev  once a week unless server goes down, zone reset etc,  is  BULLSHIT......<br>
<br>
 NONE of YOU  and i mean NONE of  YOU people have tossed out any meaningful numbers of  recorded to kills  to determine  either   the Jade Reaver or  the  Green scales  drop percentage....  All any of you have done is  speculate  based on  what YOUR  experiences have been. So in that light,<br>
lets Jump back to my experiences with  Both mobs.....<br>
<br>
 Sev...  I tried  1 time.  Raalf way back when kunark was still pretty new  lead  a raid on him, at that time i was still predominately playing  Bloodson (necro) and i was lvl 52 at the time.....  Was roughly  40 ppl on the  raid, a good mix of lvls thou  as  a 52 i was one of the lowest lvls attending. Raalf made groups,  we all buffed up,  Raalf pulled.  Call to attack came.. me and pet raced in.. i tried to cast a spell.  was interrupted by Sev's dragon roar  and was sent mindlessly running off in fear as was  many others.  Fear ends i race back, next  dragon roar  off i go running again. did this 5 or 6 times and  finally  enough ppl were already dead as to make the raid a   failure.  I then  FD'd and  /q'd out to clear aggro...  Logged back in and helped CR as needed. Needless to say i didn't bother trying  Sev again.<br>
<br>
Black Reavers, all told guess i've logged 200-300 hours in Com doing nothing but the reaver cycles for, guilds,friends and friends of friends  druids/rangers practically everytime i was asked.  Now the most i ever saw was 5  JR's from   1 cycle and the least i ever saw was  No  JR's in 8 hours of killing. I would also say a typical  cycle of killing actually involved killing 8-10 reavers and a excellant cycle yielded 20 or more Black Reaver pops.<br>
<br>
 Now then, based on this information, I would contend  Sev is not doable by any small to mid-guild composed  mostly of lvl 45-55 players.... Becuase of the dragon roar and apparent lack of resists to it,which we all know as you either get closer to NPC's lvl or exceed it.  your chance of resisting thier spells increases pretty much on a  graduated scale in relation to PC to NPC lvl..  <br>
   If Sev has been changed, since the time i fought him  then naturally the prior  statement is obsolete being as it is based on outdated information..... If not then  having multiple lvl 60's, well buffed resists definitely appear a Must have to actually succeed. Further investigation of Sev's loot table indicates he can drop  multiple green scales.<br>
  Now to everyone that has mentioned  &quot; Chance&quot;.......<br>
We all know &quot;random chance&quot; is a factor,anytime you kill a mob that has NOT been proved to drop  Item A  &quot;Every&quot; time.<br>
But for the life of me  i fail to see how anyone can logically  argue the  JR is tougher to get then the Green scale.  Given the  &quot;Number&quot; of chances of it dropping available from killing doing the black reaver cycle or killing Sev.<br>
  If just if,  Everyone ran into CoM  killed  ONE  Black Reaver and zoned out,  then and only then I would be tempted to agree that  that  Sev drops the green scale more often then a black Reaver drops the  JR.... Then again, logic would suggest if a Mob_A is  2 hour spawn and  Mob_B is 7 day spawn, that  MoB_B should drop loot more often because the fewer chances there is to kill Mob_B....<br>
    Now based on respawn timer and nothing else, killing Black Reavers far and away give you the most &quot;CHANCES&quot; to get loot,  regardless of what time frame you choose..  One hour,one day,one week,one year  etc.<br>
     Now based upon the number of hours i've sat in  the bazaar  item watching, chatting or otherwise  goofing off.  I have  seen  Jade  Reavers for sale  many many many times and have seen a Green scale being sold twice.... Again, my experiences, but also indicates   jade reavers enter the game HELLUA lot faster and  easier then Green Scales do.\<br>
<br>
     Now lets base drop rate on Price:<br>
<br>
       Jade Reaver  12-18kplat  or there abouts<br>
       Green  Scale  20-30kplat  or there abouts<br>
<br>
   Ayep, i see the logic now.....  Green scale drops so often and NO ONE wants it that people are damn  near giving it away..../sarcasim off .......  However,  price, at least to me, has always been a indicator of  the demand,difficulty or rarity for an item , so if thats the case a  Green Scale  is much more in demand, harder to get and rarer then  the  jade reaver is......<br>
<br>
    Hell, lets conduct a poll...  Epified  Druids or Rangers  verse Warriors......  Which class has more epic's from lvl 50-55?  How about from  55-60?    <br>
 <br>
    Overall,  all of you can  slap this topic  back and forth till the Admins either  closed this thread,  we all die of old age, or everyone accepts the fact.  That regardless of respawn time...  Random chance is the sole deciding factor on whether ANY MOB  drops anything on thier available loot or not, unless aforementioned mob  drops is a KNOWN to drop  phatlewt_01  everytime..<br>
<br>
  Enuff said,<br>

It's all anybody can do. It's nice to offer your experience as advice for someone making the same attempt, but when you compare different experiences you'll never get the same results or come to a definitive conclusion because there are not enough people available to kill all reavers/dragons around the clock, or a place to record their findings.<br>
<br>

IF reavers were camped 24/7 you would have at least 504 spawns (6 reaversx12spawns per dayx7days) and thats IF they don't split.<br>
<br>
And the 1% drop rate is BS, because at least 1 reaver HAS dropped in every neh/rak raids I've been on, so I'm leaning towards the 1 outta 9.  Sooo, best case scenario you'd have ~56 jade Reavers drop, where as you maybe have 1 green scale from Sev.<br>
<br>
Millikin my defense for selling a epic drop was that I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE THAT NEEDED. No guildies needed, no friends needed, no friends twinks needed.  Are you unable to understand english, or just stupid?<br>
<br>
My example of my twink group that was able to kill said reavers was to show just how simple it is to make a group that IS able to kill them... so sorry the 'I can't get people to come to CoM because the EXP sucks' dont work (CoM exp rocks back in the castle area up til 54 or so btw you fool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) and drops suck don't work, since that can be said about any kunark zone now.  How hard is it to find a 40+ rogue to open the door, a monk to pull, a healer and some form of tank?  Quas and Autum and co. were able to clear 5 of the 6 reaver spawns and get 3 jade reaver drops with FOUR people.... and all four are at around HoT Armor level gear wise.

OMG WTF WTF? Kunark has comparable HoT/Velious armor?

<br>
I totally agree, it's the only reasonable way to value anything. And in my view this valuation seems appropriate. But the green scale is not &quot;much&quot; more in demand, even by your own numbers. It is 2k-12k more valuable.<br>
<br>
If Jade Reavers are indeed so easy go camp them get two and buy a green scale, (shrug).<br>
<br>
The druid sells the wizard VH hides using his evil tracking ability who uses the money to buy a JR from a warrior he got using his evil melee ability who uses the money to buy a green scale from a wizard who got it using his evil nuking ability.<br>
<br>
I don't know. It's how VI wanted things to work. If they didn't want it to work this way then they need to fix it.<br>
<br>

<br>
What is it? You guys still trying to pass the lie off that Sev is a 7 day spawn? ROFL. My numbers reflected his true spawn rate.<br>
<br>
But correct I didn't include splits, but it doesn't really matter because they aren't camped 7/24 anyway.<br>
