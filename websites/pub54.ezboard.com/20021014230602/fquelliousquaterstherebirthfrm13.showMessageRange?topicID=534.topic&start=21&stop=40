<br>
I will say, however, that I've never received a tell from Ulwern in my life. The tell I got that night in Umbral was from a friend of mine in VoR, through whom I know Mac. The exact tell was &quot;Are you guys going to KS UP?&quot;, at which point I nearly lost it from laughing. So I ask her what the hell she meant and I get this long story (from Mac, she didn't wanna tell me) about how Wintyr had trained them at the ice caves in Umbral (when he hadn't left my sight the whole time), and that he'd done it the night before, etc etc etc, when I know he was in fear on Trist. How do I know? I was on the phone with him at the time. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, I know there was at least 10 minutes of kiting between the announcement that he was up and the decision to gather to kill him. There were 9 members of UP online when I checked about 5 minutes after the annoucement, including the ench in Oasis. Not one of them was anywhere NEAR Oasis. No one in commons, no one in Sro, not even anyone in Iceclad. The closest person UP had online was in the Nexus.<br>
<br>
So yeah, I've said what I came to say on the issue. Rest assured, though, that any further personal attacks (against Trist or any other member of Radiant) will result in swift and brutal flaming. <p>Lauriston Pianoforte<br>That Guy<br>Bard of Quellious</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/upunkassgypsy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punkass Gypsy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Rat Bastard</span><br>  Posts: 314<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/22/02 3:01:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=534.topic&index=22>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good ole Radiant? eh?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Of coarse, they can’t figure out easy vindy pull(good laugh at PallyEQ forum<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You're right. We couldn't figure out the easy vindi pull! So we asked for advice, we got advice and we won. Dead Vindi. Yeah... I guess that makes us newbs. If sucking up pride and asking for education and advice to take out new things for us is newbish, call us the newbie brigade because (unlike your poor uneducated ass), we are willing to learn anything and everything it takes to make us better.<br>

Serpent.

Shame on you, what an utter and useless laughable tragedy that you'd ever bring someone else oblivious to the whole situation into your pathetic attempt to justify. The last time I saw Serpent was a few months ago for a brief appearance in Velketor's...and as a true classic, we DE formed together. You're too funny, Ulwern, and if you are Serpent, I don't see how you could be the original, and if you are, I'm sorry about the accident friend, I hope you soon regain full mental capacity.<br>
<br>
Serpent would never do something so selfish, so childish, and so stupid as you have done.<br>

He felt justified to screw them because he felt screwed by them in the past.<br>

I dont know what happened in the past and dont know what happened here. I wasnt there either time and I never pretend to know a story unless I see it first hand(and even then there are 2 sides), yet, he said himself he wouldnt have done that to just anyone. Which means he was able to justify doing something bad because something bad was done to him.<br>

It is an eye for an eye, which is a justification, something I do not personally believe in.<br>

I said I saw people coming out of the buildings, and then a plethora of monsters start to pour out. Yes, there were some of you still standing, but that is because we decided to move past, and catch some of the flak. God forbid we try to rectify your call to camp your clerics, and salvage everyone from being wiped out anyway. We moved past you, and as you know, at safe camp 90% of the mobs will path through the side to the left and come running along the wall. Blame the fact that you were still left standing to the skill and quickness of our enchanters to be able to mez all of that crap so it never came to touch you. <br>
<br>
What's even worse is that there were so many mobs that kept coming and coming, and we kept on battling and battling, while the mobs already slain by us had time to rot enough for you and yours remaining to check them for loot...what, you thought I didn't see that, either? Whoops, wrong again. Yeah, theres corpse timers, and loot messages, and no, we don't need any armors from Hate, but I'll be hot damned...thats attempted ninja looting son, it doesn't get any older and more lame than that. <br>
<br>
Here's your shovel, Ulwern, I don't think you've quite dug yourself deep enough yet.<br>
<br>
SIDE NOTE: Sachem, we don't let someone who has freely killed someone walk around on the street whistling happily once we have found them out, do we? We then &quot;justify&quot; as you'd put it, by throwing them in jail, strapping them to the chair, or, in extreme cases that we hate, let them free, and let the relatives of the slain inflict retribution (At least I would hope so!) upon them. I know I wouldnt let them run free, and I hope you wouldnt either. Granted, this is just a game, a load of colored pixels, but a sin is a sin, a wrong is a wrong. Two wrongs definitely don't make a right, but it sure does make the initially offending party think about what they've done, unless they are a totally sick and depraived individual.<br>

But when the post touches on the guild I recently recruited with, joined, and contains a bunch of people I know and love, I am inclined to make a response.<br>
<br>
First let me talk a little about Radiant.  I recruited with Radiant for a week about, yes only a week, and in that week we killed rumblecrush, Vindi, Sev, golems in fear, and royals in chardok in that order.  I am a firm believer in raid attendence barring RL interference so I attended all the raids I heard about to give Radiant a better chance to know me (they found out I am a little deranged!).  Radiant is a medium sized guild yet they managed to take down a mob like Vindi (yes I know it is easy for some guilds but was Radiant's first try).    We wiped the first 2 pulls of Vindi but Radiant picked itself back up and persevered enough to kill Vindi on the third try.  That is how Radiant is, yes there will be wipeouts on raids but they will always pick themselves back up, restrategize and conquer the mob that they are fighting.  We heard that Vindi was up but contrary to believing we would be unable to take down Vindi with the people we had online we maintained a sanguine attitude and said what the hell, lets give it a shot.  We are extremely confident in our own abilities to get the job done and the worse thing that can happen is the raid gets wiped a few times, you get rezzed, and go home knowing that you tried your best, and prepare for the next time you face the mob.<br>
<br>
I was extremely impressed with the mobilization and caring attitude expressed by all.  Whether letting a LC members tag along on a raid to get a shard for the VT key quest, helping a member camp the elusive shards in Sf, or helping with another guild's slaying or Ragefire, Radiant is always out and about helping each other and even non members occaisonally.  <br>
<br>
Using my sense summoned spell I Found out Sev was up, but we had only 14 people online about yet our leader Trist said that we were damn well going to try to kill him being as we had 2 warriors needing just the green scales and blade (neither was on at the time but that did not stop us) from queen. (yes, we beat the Mbers there !)  Rumples, the previous day was auctioning to buy the green scale but he woke up the next day finding it already in his possession.  A quick queen kill and he was epicced.  <br>
<br>
Radiant is a good guild and thrives on helping others.  We just got another cleric epic recently and completed another ranger epic while in hate.   We use a similar loot system as Lc where if a item drops, you send a tell to a loot officer or Trist saying you would like to put your name up for it, that is where one of the loot officers decides among a number of factors who best deserves the item.   I have yet to see one item distributed unfairly.  It is a system conducive to need...not greed.<br>
<br>
Now...back to the topic.  I was in PoH when this occured and I know from my experiences with Radiant that they would never intentionally ruin the gaming experience of others.  We were confident of our force to fight into hate instead of running to safe camp and ressing there.  We would have no cause to train it.  We pulled a few mobs to port in until it was clear to move to safecamp...there was no way we could have trained that many mobs from port in.  Trist died from sort of chain aggro that we thoought you guys had initiated.  He was summoned and promptly killed.  This may or may not have been true as there were having pulling issues all weekend in hate.  Mobs pathing strangely and such.  We make it to safecamp and mobs suddenly come out from nowhere They did not follow us to safecamp cause they did not come from that direction.  You don't get that many mobs in camp by accident.  I believe there was some insidious intent on the behalf of UP to train us.  After we killed them, we were angry and rightly so, and wanted nothing more to do with your guild though.  We ignored our impulsiveness to train you guys like you did us.  Moved on to the 2nd floor and killed stuff there where we encounted some more chain aggro (or not, as someone saw a UP member there), got a ton of mobs in camp, wiped, commenced with Cr, yada yada.  Then to top of matters you guys come up there to laugh at us?  I mean, my gosh that is just beyond immature.  It is extremely tough to get me angry but the sequence of events that occured in Hate managed it.  I did not openly say anything to UP because I prefer to avoid confrontation, not contribute to it (reason I don't usually post on the flame boards) but libelous words spoken against people who have proven to me their benevelent intent irked me like no other.    It makes me sad that events like this happen on Quellious and even more so when it involves people I have come to care about.<br>
<br>
I wasn't at the Cazel killing so not going to post my opinion on that as it would prolly be bigoted towards UP from the recent meltdown in hate.<br>
<br>
Btw, Thanks Lc for lending a hand with Rumblecrush the other day before you went to VT.  Don't know whether we needed the help or not as it was our first try on him but it was welcome nonetheless ).<br>

The Trains kept coming, and you were always right next to us when that happened.  <br>
<br>
The first time in Hate, we knew you were in Hate, so we just got to Safecamp and camped out till the next day.  But would you do that for us??  Nope, that's obvious.  <br>
<br>
Cazel- I wasn't there for this, wish I was though. So I could at least know what happened.  But I can truly say, I know for a fact that Trist would never KS or try to hurt someone by taking over or engaging someone elses kill.  Thats it plain an simple.<br>

I dunno!  In all my years of EQ, I have never added a person to my ignore list.  But a UP member is on it.<br>

But for any enchanters reading this who still need Cazel there's a secret. Cazel has an insane regen rate and thus a druid dotting or (and more importantly) an enchanter dotting doesn't make a dent. Plus, he summons which just generally sucks for most casters. The trick is that a disease dot takes out his regen. Grab a necro, sk or shammie (dunno, beastmaster? yeah, I'm clueless about the class). Get them to cast a disease dot on Cazel, and now it'll all fall into place. Get Cazel snared, fear him and have at him. I was able to knock down Cazel about 20 min before servers went down one night with the help of a 50 something shaman, druid and a L40 something rogue. Couple minutes later dead giant and one utensil to tick off the epic scavenger list. Immortals of Justice so rocked. I miss Raymhund and the other people from way back then.<br>
<br>
And for some unsolicited moralizing, takes two to fight, and one to make a peace offering. I guess everyone draws their own line about where they will and won't go in defense of their honor. It's just too bad that there's a bunch of relatively innocent people who'll end up being the focus of a game of tit for tat. Sounds like both parties are letting themselves sink to a lower standard than they usually hold themselves to. Personally, the person/guild who makes the selfless gesture gets respect from me. <br>

I guess I'd get more worked up about this if it was the Wraith of the Shissar, or some other actual hard or rare part of the epic quest.  It's not.  This is some wimpy sand giant that spawns relatively often in a newbie zone, whose item drop is tradable.  Is there anyone who's ever had their epic held up and incompleted for weeks because they were only missing the spoon?<br>
<br>
Now that that's said.. I am a completely neutral party who doesn't know anyone involved here personally.  I'll just remind Tristadorn/Radiant.. a while back, you were complaining about losing out on the real prize enchanter Epic piece, the Fear part, to another guild I forget (ADD?  Yeah, I suffer from Attention Deficit Disorder, your point?).  Now, you knowingly take actions that lead other people to look upon you the same way, though admittedly to a much less important creature.  If at any point you ever plan to take a moral high road, you had better make sure you keep to it yourself by keeping your reputation squeaky clean.  Doing things like this and saying they're justified because &quot;the other guys trained us/were rude/looked at us funny&quot; just doesn't cut it.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you don't want to take the moral high road anymore.. then welcome to the dark side!  Population, me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Shit, if its really that important, I know every time I've ran thru Oasis lately (which is rare, though) I've seen Cazel up...it is just a freaking spoon, and like its been said earlier, its easily gotten...if I see him up, I'll freaking call you if it'll make you happy...I don't even think any more of our chanters need the stupid thing, but I may be wrong.<br>
<br>
My whole thing was the Hate raid. I did'nt ever /ooc anything to UP while we were there, all I did was casually come over and /yawn at the ones still standing there (and checking our pile of NPC corpses, I reinterate!) for pulling such a bullshit stunt. Hell, I could run straight through the middle of the zone and not pull THAT much aggro, I'm serious about that one.<br>
<br>
And I gave love to the chanters, read up a little bit. I gave love to our chanters that kept that nasty mess mezzed. I did also state that it was a game, so what if I used an extreme comparison? Ok, so a guy steals a Coke and a candy bar from a store...we don't let that kind of loopy shit pass either, right? Extreme measures call for extreme comparisons, my momma always told me.<br>

Or something like that.<br>
