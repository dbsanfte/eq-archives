Kunark Dragons.  <br>
<br>
WW Dragons - loads of em, no one particularly NEEDS them (unless its for a specific purpose).<br>
<br>
Reavers - Repop every what? hour ? sure they are 100% MR - but some mobs are 100% MR.  You say they are the same, but they are numerous. X pop before Ghiosk does, there are 3-4 upstairs near Rek and a couple near Nek.  How can these possibly be put in the same league as mobs that pop randomly (1-2 times per week) which stuff that guilds not approached post epic encounters still need.  <br>
<br>
Warriors lose defensive - let me tell ya something about warriors ... an average warrior (not someone with totally loads of gear) can have a compariable AC with a Paladin, as well as HPs.  (I have around the same hps as my friend, Banelion and I have Cobalt BP, couple of pieces of SS and rest Warlord as well as epic) <br>
<br>
We do not get a heal, we dont get a fantastic taunt apart from the basic one (whereas SKs, Rangers, Pallys) get an awesome amount of taunt powers.  <br>
<br>
We dont inflict a large amount of damage, so what sets us apart from the rest? Defensive, nothing more, nothing less.<br>
<br>
Warriors were/are/will be nothing without a cleric behind them, which we are TOTALLY reliant upon.  Whilst the other classes have been massively upgraded, warriors have remained the same.  <br>
<br>
I feel that their position in Norrath is fine, we do nothing exceptional except take damage.  <br>
<br>
However, this does not take it away from the fact that warriors do have to tank, but in some occasions - a Paladin/SK or as an outside chance - Ranger will do..<br>
<br>
I laugh when I hear the day when 4 warriors can take down anything substantial - even Ragefire (about Naggy strength) even with the best weapons, the best equipment - we would all die.  <br>
<br>
On the wizards v Kunark Dragons thing, sorry guys you are STILL defending your corner.  <br>
<br>
I re-iterate its a question, not an accusation as to why 4 wizards can take out a Kunark dragon which maybe 80% of the server can make use of.  <br>
<br>
A couple of wizards have admitted that it is open for abuse - and it will.  <br>
<br>
I know people have said that well why break what isn't broken.  This is part of forward planning and organising ahead of time.<br>

<br>
No @#%$?<br>
<br>
You still havent addressed the facts other then restating &quot;I think it's overpowered&quot;,  but did go into a nice spill about warriors capabilities.<br>
<br>
Damn straight Warriors are defensive and take damage.  They take lots of damage too.  And their level 60 taunt is a must.  Thank god for warriors!! <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> we dont get a fantastic taunt apart from the basic one (whereas SKs, Rangers, Pallys) get an awesome amount of taunt powers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think you greatly underestimate the power of level 60 warrior taunt.  As a wizard, It's my job to stay number 2 on the hate list so I know which classes can really taunt really good and which can not.  On big mobs, ie, level 65+ a level 60 warrior can let me do a lot more damage faster without getting eaten.  In fact, It's VERY noticeble.<br>
<br>
Uber mobs take lots of warriors and defensive to even have a shot at them.  Kunark dragons don't because they are trivial.  In fact, most kunark dragon fights are just a 45 second zerg fight anyways...but I'm sure you know that =p<br>
<br>
In fact, do you even have a clue to how valuable 'Defensive' is?<br>
<br>
Reavers? lol, I'm not sure who brought up Reavers but they aren't even nearing the same class as Kunark dragons.  In fact, there are frogs in seb that are tougher then Reavers.  Hell, we've had lower level rangers offtank Reavers with no problems...I'm sure I even had at some point.<br>
<br>
So yep, I'll agree with you there Raluvin.  The only thing I don't understand is how often people dont bring wizards to Reaver fights.  100% MR sure... but not even close against Lures.  Oh well, more exp for me =p<br>
<br>
So, if you want to defend your &quot;MB is overpowering&quot; arguement.  Take a look at what we have told you, and show us how we are wrong.  Not just restate that you think it's overpowering.  <br>
<br>
I won't restate what these points are as you can just look back through the posts.  But until you actually argue these points and show that we are wrong then...<br>

<br>
My discussion is based on the fact:<br>
<br>
WHY should 4 wizards kill:<br>
<br>
what 10(uber people)<br>
15(semi-uber people)<br>
20(less than semi uber)<br>
25+ 55-60s....sorry this is to be politically correct for people<br>
<br>
In KUNARK/some SoV <br>
<br>
This is not class balancing.  It should at least take an equal amount of wizards in theory to kill a Kunark Dragon.  <br>
<br>
Sure there has to be a little flexbility for arguments sake, but under no circumstances should four wizards do what more than 2 1/2 times the amount of people can do.  <br>
<br>
So, Can anyone answer this question ? <br>
<br>
*****Why not nerf Manaburn against Kunark mobs*****<br>
<br>
When you reply think about other factors:  <br>
<br>
*  Will wizards abuse this power<br>
*  Should they be able to farm these items<br>
*  Will this cause further arguments in future<br>
*  They nerfed Naggy/Vox for post 52+, what was the reason for this? <br>
*  Do wizards get other benefits which are otherwise unavailable for other classes<br>
*  In this field are wizards balanced ? <br>
<br>
I am sure I have missed a few, but chew on a couple of those factors before ya post.  <br>
<br>
I do not believe MB is overpowered, I dont think it is - but I do believe it should be capped to be selective towards its targets.  <br>
<br>
Just a few bullet points of advantages and disadvantages of nerfing MB versus Kunark Dragons would be interesting.<br>
<br>
I re-state this is not anything personal against Wizards - its a mere question to provoke a discussion which it has done, although some people take this as a personal insult - Please do not take away my toy!!!!!, Ill fight tooth and nail for this toy<br>

Gore kill ( arguably the tougher of the kunark dragons )<br>
<br>
one group ( 6 ) uber wizards can kill - 4 if you happen to get a rare crit...laff.  It would be done with 5-6 ) 5 might be pushing it a bit. 5 x 6k = 30k damage... gore has more then that I believe.<br>
<br>
- I believe a wizard with manaburn would be considered uber<br>
<br>
one group ( 6 ) uber Holy trinity classes group can kill<br>
<br>
6 wizards - 6 holy trinity<br>
<br>
either/or = dead Gore<br>
<br>
So..... your argument is null/void/proven wrong.<br>

The fact that wizards are one of the poorest classes in the game while warriors are one of the richest cause of exp groups doesnt mean anything eh?<br>

<br>
Manaburn IS overpowered, but not for the reasons you think.<br>
Killing kunark dragons? Bah, I, personally, could care less. <br>
<br>
Why it's overpowered is cause the max hate you can get from a mob for anything is 800 pts. (This isn't including taunts, they have no definate value.) Normally, every nuke a wizard does for 2k would get them around 800 pts, but they can do 8-16k (depending on crit or not) with manaburn, for VERY low aggro. <br>
<br>
Don't believe me? Have a warrior get aggro on a mob, and have a cleric cast a CH on him. After the CH, wizard can manaburn and then just stand there, with the mob barely blinking at them. Why?  CH = same amount of aggro as a MB, so if the cleric lives, the wizard will too. Sure, the wizard will be OOM, but with just 1 of the 3 charge mod rods, and epic, familiar, c3, bard song, POTG, etc etc, they'll have enough mana for normal nukes real fast. <p><center><img src="http://www.relinpor.com/sigs/zeiksig.jpg">

<br>
When you reply think about other factors: <br>
<br>
* Will wizards abuse this power<br>
* Should they be able to farm these items<br>
* Will this cause further arguments in future<br>
* They nerfed Naggy/Vox for post 52+, what was the reason for this? <br>
* Do wizards get other benefits which are otherwise unavailable for other classes<br>
* In this field are wizards balanced ? <br>
<br>
None of these points were answered.<br>
<br>
Pal specifically, I never mentioned 4 wizzys v Kunark mobs - some other wizard said this before....As I am not infallable and not versed well in the wizard class, then I stood corrected on this front.  But I do understand basic mathematics <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
2ndly - SoV mobs - Wuoshi springs to mind.  <br>
<br>
3rdly - I am talking about Kunark mobs.  Whilst Zeik said he could not care less about Kunark mobs, neither could I for that matter - the point still remains - this is not about me, not about Zeik - this is about the server in general.  <br>
<br>
4thly - Sev was attempted last night and you lost.  Unlucky Blal, dont like to see anyone lose to any mob - but I would guess you had 4-6 MB wizards there.  Who was gonna loot the scale when there is so much competition for it?  I already know one of 2 possible answers ... <br>
<br>
5thly - Is Holy Trinity a wizard spell ? /shrug.  But guessing that it is - you cast this on a mob, you have casting time - I assume would need to recast it.  By the time you get to recast, things will prolly be getting difficult, do you have to cast in melee range ? If you do you got little chance of getting a 2nd cast out - I would assume anyway....Again correct, me if I am wrong<br>
<br>
6thly - Desaran, warriors do cause more damage than Paladins / SKs - but not a hell of a lot more.  For the extra damage warriors give to mobs, we lose either a set of excellent group spells / or direct damage to mobs + FD.    <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uraluvinssteele.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raluvin Ssteele</A> at: 6/6/02 5:13:02 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uvaldayana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valdayana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ruler of Quellious</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/6/02 6:24:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=323.topic&index=132>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This may touch some nerves, but WTF lets see what happen</span><hr size=1> They've come out and talked about this publicly, the design team has.. and they've said that while they did make the Nagafen/Vox change a long time ago, due to the evolution of the game, they can't go and make similar changes each time a new expansion comes out.  So, yes, things (in this case Kunark dragons) will take less people to kill.  That's the way the game's always been though.. when you reach a certain level of power, things below you become more trivial.  You'll say Gorenaire is a level 60 dragon, but remember, she's a level 60 Kunark era dragon.  There's been two expansions since then, both of which have greatly increased player power.  Thus, Gorenaire is as trivial to the high-end players now as Nagafen and Vox were when Kunark was released.  If I ever got Dire Charm, large parts of the game that were intended to be single-group areas would suddenly become easily soloable by me, including most of Sebilis.  That might not be fair, but that's what happens when a class's power expands.  It's the same with wizards and Manaburn, it's just because of the somewhat one-dimensional scope of wizards (burn baby burn!) that their class improvements are more noticable.  Just like a wizard who got Ice Comet could go and kill Najena in one shot for her by-then underpowered items, now 4-6 wizards who've spent a lot of time getting to level 60 and going beyond that for AA points can (hopefully) kill Gorenaire or Severilous in one shot each for by-then underpowered items.  I can't really think of any items the dragons drop that level 60 wizards with tons of AA points would need.  And if you're worried about them hogging epic parts.. well, people can hog Phinigel Atropos for his epic parts and other items.  Groups of people can attempt to hog Ragefire.  It's not really a different case, except that wizards are the only class needed for this particular case of killing.  You still need several of them working together, just like you need several people working together to kill Phinigel, or other similar scale encounters.  They're a lot easier than they were when they originally came out, but that's because players are more powerful, if they put the brakes on and scale back player power then we'll all be in trouble when we try to go back to Velious or Luclin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontaguethesorcerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montague the Sorcerer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Social Butterfly </span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/6/02 7:39:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=323.topic&index=133>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This may touch some nerves, but WTF lets see what happen</span><hr size=1> OMFG OMFG OMFG SOMEBODY CALL THE &quot;RALUVIN POLICE&quot;!!!

<br>
It is posted in the flame section, because yes it could have become heated and did in certain areas.   It is for other people to flame, not me....<br>
<br>
I play a game, I try to be courteous, I try to be understanding, I try to be helpful, I try to lead raids, I try to accommodate my guildies/friends/allies and other people. <br>
<br>
I don't try to unintentionally hurt people, I don't walk over others camps, I don't KS, I don't zone steal, I try not to waste other people's time.  <br>
<br>
And I definitely do not Flame people without a reason with substantial evidence to support my claims.<br>
<br>
I do however provoke discussions on 'grey area topics' where there are 2 sides to a story.  <br>
<br>
Look at the posts I have made:  <br>
<br>
Rules v Common Courtesy and this one.  <br>
<br>
Both appear to be popular and the 'Rules v Common Courtesy' thread had more political relevance than perhaps this thread does.  This tends to be more Class assigned, which makes it more personal, which in turn has resulted in people becoming more guarded and aggresive than the rules v common courtesy thread.  <br>
<br>
Both threads have high potential for flames, so yes it is very relevant to this section of the board.  <br>

<br>
Your rambling on and on about things based on pure opinion, speculation, and fear (yes, your fear that wizards will rule the world or something crazy like that).... I have seen no facts here.  I have seen no examples from you about an inncident that happened regarding you and MB.<br>
<br>
You point out that a group of wizards can do what a full raid sometimes can't even do.  We counterattack and say that a good enough group of balances classes can kill these mobs just as easily.<br>
<br>
What do you do?  You change the subject... you whine that &quot;no no im not insulting wizards, im not saying NERF NERF, in fact... i love wizards!&quot;.<br>
<br>
Let me show you the facts Raluvin:<br>
- A group of 60 wizards with good enough gear (gear = mana) can kill a 2 year old (RL time) dragon.<br>
- A group of balanced classes of level 60 players can do the same.<br>
<br>
We say, &quot;What about a heal spell for 10000 points!&quot;... you seemingly ignore that, why?  Because a spell like Complete Heal helps YOU out!  You wouldn't want them to nerf that.<br>
<br>
What about the Holy Blade thing paladins have?  Why don't you make another &quot;discussion&quot; (read: flame) thread about them?  I've seen paladins do upwards of 4500+ damage in a single swing of their sword... do you consider that &quot;overpowered&quot;?  (Not that I do)<br>
<br>
I have brought up the fact that these dragons have been in the game for a very long time.  You say &quot;because they drop good loot and are labelled 'Dragons', a single group shouldn't be able to win&quot;...<br>
I say,  a group of lvl60 wizards killing kunark dragons for what level 50-59 people call &quot;uber loot&quot; is like a level 49 wizard killing the Oracle in OOT for his robe, which a level 30 wizard might even consider &quot;uber&quot;...<br>
<br>
<br>
The game changes dude... each time a new expansion comes out the 1st Tier monsters get lowered to 2nd Tier, the 2nd Tier monsters get lowered to 3rd Tier, and on and on.  Without this systematic change, this perpetual growth... the game would be very boring.<br>
<br>
I have a fear that when Planes of Power comes out you will be back here on these boards, complaining that what once took 5 groups to do now only takes 1-2... maybe less.<br>
<br>
I understand tho.  You fear change.  You would rather these newbie dragons stay unkillable unless you have 50 people and the hand of god on your side.  Well,  I'm sorry to tell you this but guess what?  They will only get easier and easier. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a
