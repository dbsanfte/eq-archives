CONTRA COSTA TIMES<br>
<br>
WALNUT CREEK - Twelve-year-old Jeffrey Figueroa shot a spitball in gym class last fall.<br>
<br>
Eight months later he became a felon, convicted in juvenile court last week of battery and mayhem for launching the gum wrapper that hit a classmate's eye.<br>
<br>
The pointed projectile injured the 13-year-old severely enough that he needed eye surgery. But Jeffrey and his parents say the act wasn't intentional and doesn't deserve a criminal conviction.<br>
<br>
&quot;We thought the judicial system would do the right thing,&quot; said mom Yvette Figueroa. &quot;There was no intent, no maliciousness. We felt for the victim. Now all the sudden, the tables turned and we feel like the victims.&quot;<br>
<br>
Jeffrey, now 13, and brother Stephen each were charged in December with four felonies: two counts of assault, one of battery and one of mayhem, according to their parents.<br>
<br>
Prosecutors declined to talk about why they filed felony charges in the case, citing juvenile confidentiality laws. The now 14-year-old victim and his family also declined to comment, but their lawyer said the spitball permanently damaged the boy's right eye.<br>
<br>
The &quot;dart&quot; went through the boy's cornea and ripped the lens of his eye in two, attorney Michael Sterrett said. A time delay caused by infection from the spat paper led to the growth of scar tissue before a replacement lens could be implanted.<br>
<br>
&quot;He describes it as looking through a piece of waxed paper,&quot; he said. &quot;His entire life has been changed forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
The incident happened Sept. 5 as a Walnut Creek Intermediate School class lined up for locker assignments. Stephen said he was in the eighth-grade line and saw the boy holding his eye.<br>
<br>
The Figueroas say prosecutors tried to paint Stephen, now 14, as a co-conspirator in the spitting.<br>
<br>
Jeffrey, in another line, fashioned half of a gum wrapper into a pointed projectile and then spit the whole thing out of his mouth.<br>
<br>
It hit the eye of the victim, whom the Times is not naming because he is a juvenile.<br>
<br>
In a school discipline report from the Figueroas, a school official concluded that Jeffrey didn't act with malice.<br>
<br>
After several meetings, officials decided he would spend the year attending one class and taking the rest through independent study, Yvette Figueroa said.<br>
<br>
Charges were filed in December. The confidential three-day trial hearing ended May 7 with a judge's guilty verdict -- the two felonies for Jeffrey and one misdemeanor battery count for Stephen.<br>
<br>
&quot;We thought it was a joke they even brought charges,&quot; said dad Steve Figueroa. &quot;Now I'm sorry I ever chuckled.&quot;<br>
<br>
Although they plan to appeal his conviction, Jeffrey's June 6 sentencing has his parents nervous. The maximum term for mayhem is eight years.<br>
<br>
Deputy district attorney Jim Picco, who leads the Contra Costa District Attorney's juvenile unit, said judges in juvenile cases generally decide among such punishments as probation, juvenile hall, therapy or a combination.<br>
<br>
The worst case scenario for Jeffrey is incarceration in the California Youth Authority, home to kids who fire things more lethal than spitballs.<br>
<br>
&quot;We should be in civil court, not criminal court,&quot; his dad said. &quot;They should be trying to take my house, not my kid.&quot;<br>
<br>
The District Attorney's Office filed the charges, not his client, Sterrett said.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think it's correct to say my client supported that. My client told his story,&quot; he said.<br>
<br>
The victim and his family will sue in civil court, Sterrett said. But it's the criminal justice system that has the Figueroas worried.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is wrong with being a kid these days?&quot; said Yvette Figueroa. &quot;Some things have just gone too far.&quot;<br>
