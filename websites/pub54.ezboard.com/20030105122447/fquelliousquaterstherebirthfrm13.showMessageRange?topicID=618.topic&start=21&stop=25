<br>
Please feel free to explain your hahahahahahahah post.<br>
<br>
Where did anyone attempt to trivialize the deaths of anyone in any other country?<br>
<br>
What is your point about 10 deaths here in the U.S vs 20 in Great Brit?<br>
<br>
And I can't thank you enough for your uncanny ability to understand Turdle's ramblings and explaining his point to me (us).<br>
<br>
It's not Turdle's right to his opinion that i object to--it's his sophomoric attempts at trying to be humorous that is inappropriate on this type of topic that is offensive.<br>
<br>
Turdle's only point is to be shocking and offensive.<br>
The biggest burp. Eating snot outa his nose. Farting at a funeral.<br>
<br>
My problem with you is that you seem to find his childish behavor entertaining. That and your need to one up in this tragedy - e.g. 20 to 10. Over 2000 ppl lost their lives on September 11, nearly every country suffered casualties--I don't see the point in discussing who got the worst end of that stick.<br>
<br>
But my biggest complaint is that in the U.S even the death penalty is administered humanely. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nandaben>nandaben</A> at: 10/28/02 10:14:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gypsysongman>Gypsy Songman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Lout<br><font color=blue>QC Supporter</span><br>  Posts: 418<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/28/02 10:23:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=618.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> My point</span><hr size=1> My hahahahahah was that people- some of them the same who were up in arms about censorship in the flame section, back when it used to say &quot;completely unmoderated&quot;- were trying to have someone banned for expressing his opinion. Granted, he did so in a completly inappropriate way. But you shouldn't ban someone just because you don't like what they're trying to say; that, my friends, is not the &quot;American Way&quot;.<br>
<br>
I am perhaps a bit oversenstive on this point because of the way the media treats international loss of life. I have in my house a copy of my local paper- the Austin-American Statesman- that came out either the day after or the day after the day after the JI attack on some nightclubs in Bali. It was their first coverage of the story. And it wasn't the headline.<br>
<br>
Guess what was? It was something about the sniper. I believe that he had just claimed another victim. I was-and continue to be- outraged that 190 Australian and Balinese lives were <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>less important</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than one American life.<br>
<br>
I included the snippet about my experience with terrorism because I thought it may provide some perspective on where I'm coming from with this. Apparently it didn't. <br>
<br>
And if I found his attempts at humor at all funny, I wouldn't be telling people to ignore him. I want him gone as bad as anyone else. I just think that if he's going to be banned, he needs to be banned for breaking the rules, and not because the majority doesn't agree with his opinion. Hence my inclusion of the &quot;Ban him for not including his in-game name&quot; line; that is against the rules of these boards and is a bannable offense. At least, it used to be.<br>
<br>
See now?<br>

I don't believe people want to ban turdle for his &quot;opinions&quot;<br>
The ban request came Long before this post due to his inane posting on a number of threads. <br>
<br>
Freedom of speech has its limitations. Even a flame board should have limits. We, as a society don't expect--nor would we give two year olds equal time to babble about lolly-pops when adults are discussing the economy or world affairs etc just because we believe in the principle of free speech. <br>
How long do you think an intelligent conversation can continue with a two year old chyming in--there's a reason 60 Minutes has no such moderator on their payroll.<br>

<br>
Lauriston, I know that you're British and thus have a bit more international a view than some. I know that you're also pretty much a screaming liberal. Both are acceptable, and both are entirely your right.<br>
<br>
You don't have to be a Jackass about this though.<br>
<br>
Think about this rationally. Why would an American paper in Texas cover the sniper in DC with greater importance than the bombing in Bali? The answer is easy. It's because the odds of anyone in Austin being related to someone in Bali are slim, while the odds that they might be related to, friends with, or care about someone in DC are pretty damned good.<br>
<br>
I was shocked and mortified when I read about the Bali bombing. It was a pointless and shameful loss of life. But when people get shot by some asshat in DC and the press doesn't reveal their names, I start making another round of phone calls to the friends living there. I start wondering about the EQ folks that I know that live in the DC area.<br>
<br>
See, I can see the loss in Bali from a detached standpoint because I have no connection with it. It is horrid, I feel bad. When the loss occurs in DC, New York, LA, etc, I feel the loss personally because I have friends there.<br>
<br>
So, as far as media coverage goes, a spree killer in DC is a bit more important to me than a bomber in Bali. That bomber isn't targetting my friends.<br>
