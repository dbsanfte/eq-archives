Yes there's more than a few angry people as a result, but it mostly disappoints me because I was once guilded with Staboo, and even until today thought he was a good and fair person.<br>
<br>
In at least one sense I was pretty darn wrong. Today Staboo flat out ninja-looted the Lodizal Map piece, which is for the Eyepatch of Plunder quest. After a somewhat messy kill, (things like people dispelling snare, slows, etc) Lodizal was killed. Drops were shell, map, and 2 clubs. Barthin of CoA looted the non-no-drop items to be rolled for, and left the map to be sorted out. Standard, normal procedure for these sorts of things..<br>
<br>
..then Staboo took it upon himself to disband his group (consisting of me, Faie, Barthin, and Field) and looted the map. He denied knowing what was going on, or why the group was disbanded (despite the fact he was group leader) when asked in tells immediately.<br>
<br>
Once people were rezzed (yes it was a messy fight) it became clear exactly why he had disbanded, he'd taken the map. In talking to him further, he claimed he was right in doing so, because all the other loots had been taken. Now this was witnessed by a great many people, and Staboo admitted what he had done. Disbanded and looted. No discussion of what was happening, he just took it.<br>
<br>
Why am I posting this? Because I don't believe he deserves to escape this low act. He thinks he has, and was fully entitled to do it. What really strikes me the most, is that he disbanded us first, *that* to me indicates he was fully aware it wasn't the right thing to do, that people would be upset, etc. THAT is why my opinion of him has been destroyed, and why people should know what to expect.<br>

I personally think Lodizal is one of the hugest mistakes made by Verant, but there are many of a similar nature. Everyone gets excited, its a damn elusive and rare spawn with some *really* nice loots.. its just how far people take their excitement and desire. Nothing wrong with wanting to get the goods, but how you go about it is everything.<br>
<br>
I don't think Staboo has been ebayed. Only last week he asked me to help him with the Rygorr War / Ring 8 and he died just looking around the fort. I dragged him a long way for a rez, and he seemed like the person I always knew. I guess it takes an episode like this to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &quot;test&quot; the character of someone, and sadly, Staboo scored a big fat F- this time round.<br>
<br>
BTW, I myself passed on the opportunity of the map piece before it was ninja'd. It was probably only going to be a roll between Barthin and Staboo. I guess he didn't like those 50/50 odds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utynank.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tynan K</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/3/01 1:38:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Dispells</span><hr size=1> The dispelling of Lodizal is another issue all together, one that I won't go throwing names or accusations about because there is no solid proof of who did what. The result was that people who were fighting Lodizal died, myself included when he had a mere sliver of life left. The reason I care not to go further is because the right people still got the kill, they still received the loots (cept for the ninja'd map of course).<br>
<br>
What happened though, is I had ensnared Lodizal (10+ minute duration spell) and we were moving him around whilst getting ready. Someone starts attacking Lodi, NOT one of us, and of course our guys start getting summoned. Then I get a message my ensnare spell has worn off! Thanks dispell 1. Malloxx had arrived and Turgured/Malo'd Lodi, both of which also 'wore off' resulting in a very dead shaman. Thanks dispell 2. Clarisse also tash'd and slowed the turtle, which wore off too. Dispell 3+ by now? Luckily, my epics procced slow a number of times during the fight so he remained slowed, and that probably saved our arses. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/utynank.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tynan K</A> at: 10/4/01 2:20:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uvaugnsagred.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vaugn Sagred</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/3/01 5:03:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Staboo</span><hr size=1> I hope you reported Staboo so he can get banned, let alone get the map to someone more deserving.

the Eyepatch of Plunder is a lackluster item in my eyes its really not that great..  Id rather go around following a uber guild and ninja from them...<br>

As for staboo.. I asked him if he was waiting on Gloradin once and he said and thats the last i talked with him since Descent.. I found Staboo rather quiet in Descent so I didnt know him well...<br>

If he did this go get him Tynan! snare him and dont let him get away.. sorry for the ranger joke p <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A> at: 10/5/01 4:16:53 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/upunkassgypsy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Punkass Gypsy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Rat Bastard</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/4/01 7:32:27 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://home.nc.rr.com/temluin/Tristadorn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Staboo - Lodizal Map Piece Ninja'd</span><hr size=1> I just want to point out that this is STABOO we are talking about here.

He almost got us killed by not assisting a couple times.  Other than being a little immature and not paying attention, he seemed OK.  Probably not Ebayed.<br>
<br>
I am afraid that Tynan put it best though.  Every player, especially those who are higher level, will be tested at some point in their lives in Norrath.  There will be a time when you will come across a rare mob and have a chance to KS it or a time when you get the kill, find the item that you have been after for a while on the corpse, and have an opportunity to ninja it.  What you do at that moment will show the world what kind of character you really are.  Staboo appears to have failed his test and will now have to face the consequences.  How sad when getting phat lewt becomes more important to you than your honor and your place in the community.  Much better to have someone say &quot;Boy, his gear sux but he's a really nice guy who does a good job.  I would group with him any time&quot; IMHO. <p>Juror<BR>
