If i seem to remember somebodys post earlier, somebody said that folks even group up for exp in Fear, well if thats the case, and Banelion tried reasoning with folks, whats to say that Radiant wasnt there getting experience and also trying to reserve a mob, which you cant really do.<br>
<br>
This all harkens back to certain instances from when the server was young, some may remember this and you newbs may not. But when you were in Highold Keep killing orcs, just waiting for that one named orc to spawn, when he did, you had that one wizzy on that one rock invis who nuked the crap out of it to get the kill<br>
<br>
Now some of you may say no it isnt the same, but in essence it is. We had two guilds vying for the same spawn, and we, ADD, wanted to compromise for it. Actually now that I think of it, how can you say they were in the zone enforce just because they were there. They might have been just doing an exp group. Who are we to second guess them, and if Banelion contacted them and said hey Tristadorn, what are you doing, lets compromise on this situation, and then you get stalled....how many of you would have acted the same in the heat of passion.<br>
<br>
I may keep rehashing this, but I wont stop arguing over the fact that there are always two sides to the coin. What you may hear because they may be your friends, might not always be what really happened. We all like to go thru life thinking that our friends would never give us any disinformation, no no not them. But when it happens, then what. Act like an adult and fess up like people have done in the past.<br>
<br>
I wasnt there myself so what do I know, I am defending my guild. Qindien has gottem emails from the gms stating that there is no case of ks'ing but he, so far to this day, will try to hand over the item in question. He spoke with Radiant from what I was told and if they didnt get the shissar by Tuesday than he would give it back. But Radiant was in Hate camping the shissar , but not for Maeve but for another chanter in the guild, seeing that Qindien put forth a deal and they were still confident they were gonna get the piece.<br>
<br>
I havent logged in the game for awhile today so I have no clue what happened to dat, but if Radiant did this then it really sucks.<br>
<br>
I have no love fo rthat guild. I had my cleric rezzed them after the Fay incident and not one thank you from Tristadorn did I recieve. I did get one from Shaekee who I feel is a very nice person. But Tristadorn that bastard can't even be the man, and know when it is better to save face than save pride.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have taken alot of crap from you folks on this board, which I find quite amusing. But I still try to find a common ground which we all can coexist, but even that is slowly fading away IMHO. <p>Garaddor Ghoulbane

While I will defend Maeve to the bitter end (when Tristadorn isn't playing her), and I will likewise defend other members of Radiant - Shaekee above all others, Tristadorn's conduct borders on unconscionable (as usual)<br>

<br>
Brazin, your ramblings remind me of a chicken clucking as it pecks at bugs in the dirt.<br>
<br>
Banelion, I'm sorry to have come into conflict with you.  I wish we had met under better circumstances.  Perhaps if you had been in attendance on the fear raid, things would have turned out much better.  /salute<br>
<br>
Qindien, I'm sorry your epic quest has been tainted by this nonsense.  If you need help acquiring the piece in hate, i would be willing to assist you (though i do not speak for my guild in this).  I know you tried to return the epic piece to Maeve, and the GM-admin said that he will not transfer no-drop items regardless of the way in which they were acquired.  It was a nice gesture, but it seems you will get to keep the piece.  While I am upset and angry that my dear friend Maeve will now have to wait much longer to finish her epic, I don't hold any grudges against you personally.<br>
<br>
to those who complain about the length of this flame thread: obviously some people are pretty upset about this whole thing, on both sides.  The reason I and my guildmates are upset is more the principle of the thing than the loss of the epic piece (although we did sit in fear all weekend, no shissar argh).  being trampled over and feeling disrespected by other players is bound to create some negative emotions.  In my opinion, it's better to get that out in the open rather than let it stew into an intense hatred for eachother.  perhaps this way we can avoid future mistakes and unecessary conflict.<br>
<br>
i'll leave you with this final thought... it's only loot, a pixel in a game.  if you step back and look at it from that perspective, is &quot;lewt&quot; really worth disrespecting, lying, cheating, flaming, and wasting eachother's time?  i don't mean this to be an accusation solely at ADD, but rather, a question to all high end players in EQ (including myself).  i've come to the conclusion that the game would be much more fun if we could all just relax, and quit tearing at eachother's throats.  i sincerely hope i am not just dreaming, and that this is really possible.<br>
<br>
send me a /tell in game if you want to discuss anything else in this matter.<br>

And if they weren't in fear camping the epic piece, you'd flame them in turn for being &quot;confident they were gonna get the piece [from Qindien]&quot;.<br>
<br>
The epic camp in fear was for Maeve, not Irrellien. I think you're too blinded by &quot;lack of love for [Radiant]&quot; to see anything that appears too simple to be the truth as it pertains to them.<br>
<br>
Now, it seems that Radiant has for the most part dropped this subject, even where you blatantly insult their leader. Why not do the same? In the minds of some, it could certainly seem that you're protesting far too much. <br>

<br>
Our trip to Fear had always planned on being a two-shissar kill. It just happens that the FIRST one was KS'd! Imagine that! And <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  why</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by the she-bitch's eightteen teats should Radiant punish ourselves by not following through with our original plan and killing the 2nd shissar for Irrelien? The 1st one was supposedly still going to go to Maeve. Why on earth would we screw out our 2nd enchanter and let the KS'ers go off scot free?<br>
<br>
Explain the logic in that to me.<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Tristadorn - in case you had forgotten, according to the GM's review of their logs, there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   WAS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> no kill stealing.  Do I agree with ADD coming into the zone and going after a mob that you were clearing towards?  No.  Do I agree with ADD regarding your conduct?  From personal experience...yes.<br>
<br>
The &quot;rightful owner&quot; of the Epic piece is Qindien - per the server GM's.  Qindien made an offer on his own initiative - one which very few people would have made willingly.  It was an honorable and generous gesture, and I don't believe that anyone with even a shred of decency would deny that.<br>
<br>
However, you chose to act in a fashion that was less than noble.  Assuming that the item had been transferred to Maeve, the honorable act on your part would have been to offer to allow Qindien to loot the next piece.  Does that seem a little unfair to Irrelien?  Perhaps - however, I know Irrelien - and I don't believe Irrelien would have harbored any ill-will towards Qindien, ADD or Radiant in the long run.<br>

<br>
Eadric, first if you only knew half of what the full story is/was, then you'd understand my post.  But you don't so you chose to be rude.  As I said, the judge ruled, the jury spoke and the case is closed.  If you still don't understand then may I suggest that you speak to your leadership?  I'm confident that Trist knows why the case is closed and I'm pretty certain he can explain it.  If not, feel free to send me a tell in game and I will explain what I know (which is slightly more than half the full story.) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Second, I find it hilariously ironic that GS says &quot;The epic camp in fear was for Maeve, not Irrellien.&quot;  And then in the reply imediately below GS's, Trist says &quot;And why...should Radiant punish ourselves by not following through with our original plan and killing the 2nd shissar for Irrelien?&quot;  So was the raid for just Maeve or was it for Maeve and Irrellien?  These comments sound condradicting to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Reading from the case transcript the jury foreman comments]<br>
<br>
&quot;You Honor, we had no choice but to question the credibility of the proceding testimonies of these two witnesses.  The contradiction was too obvious to ignore.  Furthermore the logs clearly show no technical violation occured.  While there may have been room for a compromise, and the evidence shows ADD leadership attempted this, none was forthcoming.  <br>
<br>
In the finality of the circumstance nothing warrants a change of possession.  In short your honor, we find for the defendant...innocent.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Eadric, hope that help clear things up a bit.  Have a great day!  (Seriously)  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So i walked the path back.  finally coming to a spot where the amy with the umbrella was looking.  Right there i saw brownie scout footprints in the mud.
