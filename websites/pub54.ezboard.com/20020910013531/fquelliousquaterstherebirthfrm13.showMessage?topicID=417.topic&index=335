This is totally not fair at all!!!@# Seriously, before I even have a chance to cast a single AE spell on them I'm already at half life! Thats fu**ing bullshit man! Total fu**ing bullshit!!!! Before they gave wizards manaburn I hardly ever died because most raids took so long to kill me I simply used my uber AEs and pwnzored everyone before they could hurt me. Now I hardly ever last more than a day because these stupid manafu**ers make it so that I only have half as many hit points. Verant needs to make it so that only one wizard can manaburn me at a time. That way I might have a chance to kill some of them before they get a chance to burn me. I think a 30 second delay would be good. That way only 2 of them would even have a chance to cast manaburn on me before I've had time to kill everyone. The way it is now makes me think that verant just likes to roxor the coxor, because only stupid fu** coxor roxors would be so fu**ing stupid.<br>

<br>
This way MB can still be used, on longer fights then you can pace it.  <br>
<br>
However on the Kunark mobs, it allows only one wizard to burn it before the dragon dies.  i.e. dragons shouldnt last more than 30 seconds in Kunark anyway.  <br>

Any wizard who THINKS manaburn is not a problem have just gotta check the threads like the one above and recent events (Granted Quellious is one of the nicest servers) but even so we have our fair share of clowns. <br>

<br>
Rangers were supposed to be skilled at range attack and they finally are.. and its only situational.. ranger can get the DPS of a rogue (cept it looks more stylish with crits) for 3 mins every 72 mins only under the right circumstances (as in mobs pinned on a wall can't be hit with arrows.. which is the case on most raids..).  Wtf would melee range trueshot accomplish? Actualy, that would f'ing rock, trueshot in melee range.. i could tank and use bow.. (can already do that on giants in kael cos of large melee range).<br>
<br>
You dont understand what i mean by partialy resistable.  The way the spell system works in EQ regarding mobs that you have to be in melee range to cast on.. if a spell can be resisted, even if its rare or only 1-10 damage gets resisted.. it'll be 100% resisted on those mobs.  So, by tagging MB as a resistable spell (maybe like 1-10 damage resist here and there, thats not important)... that would then make it so you have to be in melee range of the mob to cast it on'em.. for the mobs in question that is.<br>

Ok, anyone at lvl 60 should be able to solo AM in Guk... Whats your point?... What about kunark dragons? Wizards are the only ones able to do it with 5.. where's the compensation?

If MB is nerfed it will just mean the NEXT most efficient combination will be used. Trueshot or Lifeburn or DC or whatever it turns out to be. High AA trivializes these mobs, period. Wizards can get there faster, but so what? One druid can get there just as fast and kite the mob until the non porters can be gathered.<br>
<br>
I have no problem if the issue is REALLY protecting mid level content, but then put your money where your mouth is. Nerf all high AA toons, because if you just take MB out of the picture you do nothing to prevent 'bottom feeding', you just arbitrarily dissallow <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> one</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> class from doing it, which is crap.<br>
<br>
If you want ONLY MB nerfed then you ARE speaking from pure prurient envy.<br>
<br>
And I'll speak to the rangers and enchanters here, as the logical next class to hit with the nerf bat, think before wishing the nerf bat on others. AM/TS/EQ is godly. Also DC enchanters can and DO solo the Kael Arena. The Arena is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> obviously</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> meant to be &quot;raid content&quot; right?

CH made the game all about one simple tired basic strategy. Everyone knows it. The devs know it. There will be no CH in EQ2. It was a mistake.<br>
<br>
For the clueless, take 10 seconds divide by MT hp multiply by mob DPS, this is the minimum number of clerics necessary to defeat any mob. All mobs are defeated this way.<br>
<br>
The problem is when a cleric gets CH the healing potential went exponential with level instead of linear linear with level, which made it necessary to have crazy mob hps.<br>

This is why the holy trinity exists. This is why it's so hard to balance classes, because they are trying to balance versus an impossible target. Cleric + Warrior power is not equal to the sum but rather the product.<br>

99% of the mobs in the game cannot be defeated except with the one tired degenerate tactic.<br>

However other than MB wizards, I can't think of one way 5 rangers with endless quiver and Super Killer magic nuclear arrows and AM3 and all the crit stuff, and max dex could possibly snap down a Kunark dragon. Ditto for DC Enchanters or Necros or anyone.<br>
<br>
The fact is MB wizards can countdown 3 2 1.... NUKE and deliver horrible damage instantly. THAT is what unbalances the dragon encounters. The instantaneousness of it. <br>
<br>
An enchanter charming himself a big nasty giant and running around the arena solo has TONS of risk associated with it. Even a pack of em doing it. The risk versus reward is there. It's not easy by any stretch of the imagination. <br>
<br>
As I have said before I have nothing against wizards and I think that MB is a great skill when used as it should be. <br>
<br>
I just forsee much darker times ahead on Quellious, when the moron wizzys finally farm enough AA to get MB and run around being jerks cause they will ALWAYS be able to engage first.

the same devleopers strategy is being used when designing all the big mobs, unfortunately, they forgot the creativity pill when making sure there was a way to &quot;win&quot; <br>

<br>
Montyy.. you PLAY an Ogre.. YOU are not an Ogre.. so lets not act dumb as one please.<br>
<br>
Why do you think mobs had to have those kinds of DPS and have those kinds of HP?<br>
<br>
Mobs did not at first. The normal mob DPS*HP/LVL progression starts to break at lvl 39. This game was not designed with CH in mind.<br>
<br>
VELIOUS and after was designed with CH in mind. They did it because the obvious degenerate tactic was making everything trivial. They had to break the 32k HP limit because of CH. If healing potential was linear there would have been  no need for 32k plus mobs. Things can be quite challenging inside 32k hp .. as long as healing ability is not INFINITE.<br>
<br>
Clerics healing/mana ratios by level:<br>
<br>
 1 1.0<br>
 5 1.4<br>
14 1.7<br>
24 2.0<br>
34 2.3<br>
<br>
then 39.. and healing potential becomes a product of mana pool times warrior HP, with a slight AC factor. Healing ability goes thru the roof.<br>
<br>
It SHOULD have been something like:<br>
<br>
44 2.6<br>
54 3.0<br>
60 3.5<br>
<br>
This allows a nice controlled balancing of mob power vs player power. As it stands it is a hairs breath between trivial and impossible. It's very hard to make a truly challenging encounter.<br>
<br>
In fact if not for CH, MB would not exist.. why would it have to? The whole 'caster balancing thing' would have been moot if caster power scaled the same way cleric/warrior power did.<br>
<br>
Now they can't nerf CH. Because they've built more than 2 expansions based on it. But they have stated CH was a mistake (like anyone could have not have noticed) and it will not be repeated.<br>
<br>
And Montyy, the formula was basic, but nevertheless accurate. It was not intended to be a lecture MT tactics. I jumped to the conclusion you would not need one.<br>

Burns fail. For the people that missed it: Dragon fear has AE range 300. MB has range 200. Dragon fear has lure(6) resists. MB can only be used every 144min. If you can't undertand the implications of those facts you should stop posting.<br>

VS is another issue. With a druid that knows what he's doing VS is almost a lock. Although VS burns do fail too, sometimes.<br>

Defensive and Cheal didn't break the game, they changed it.  <br>
<br>
Defensive is  worse than cheal in any case... and ingrained to the point now it can't be taken away :/   Warriors were made pretty gimp in the &quot;meele balancing&quot; simply because we had defensive and making us the best pure meeles PLUS defensive would have been silly.  So warriors are spelless hybrids, but with defensive we are still irreplacable on raid mobs.  <br>
<br>
Cleric epics are probably #2 biggest game breakers/changers (see how hot a topic ragefire is for an item over 2 years old.....) but like defensive they cannot afford to nerf the stick, and are unwilling to put the effect on some other ubermob item *shrug*<br>
<br>
MB doesn't break &quot;the game&quot;... just Kunark.  Actually, just the Kunark mobs that require no backup/setup to MB.   <p>Gurunt Bangoo <Wraith>

<br>
when you go over to Graffe(the wizard mecca) and make an anti-post on manaburn.. It won't be as friendly as it is here. Most people will either say you are jealous or tell you of how they are finalling sticking it to the melees who turned them down for a group just cause they were a wizard.. In fact I bet you a few wizards just burn dragons so they can shove a scale in a warrior's face and laugh.<br>
<br>
Why should only manaburn be nerfed? What about the other AA abilities some FK mentioned and others that havent been mentioned.. Why just nerf manaburn? is it because it is profitable? I have asked this before but no one has answered or given a lame excuse. something like &quot;it is situational&quot; isnt manaburn situational too?<br>
<br>
Tarf is sorta right, AA abilities and raising the level cap fooked everything up but would you still be playing if they hadn't done those..  imagining clearing Ntov with a bunch of level 50s.. even if everything was changed to scale. It still would be a lot harder.  Verant needed something to give people a reason to play.. AA and a higher level cap did that.<br>
<br>
Verant has admited a mistake in making CH montyy. It has trivialized the game whether you agree or not..  There are still some things that are tough with CH but a lot of things get trivialized as you grow as a guild.<br>
<br>
again is this about overpowered abilities or killing dragons? if wizards gathered to kill. um Velketor every time he popped. Would people complain there too? I bet you not as many cause you can't sell Velketor loot.<br>
<br>
Sure I agree Manaburn trivializes encounters but what isnt trivial to someone?  If I ask Montyy if AoW is trivial to him.. he would say hell no.. IF i asked a warrior from wraith or whatever if AoW was trivial to him.. one of them would probably say yes just cause they got the strat needed down and probably because that warrior hasn't seen a loss to AoW in a while. That doesn't mean AoW is trivial just to them.. The same goes for the manaburn wizards or anyone over the recommended fight level for a mob.<br>
<br>
Imagine what funky abilities will come out with PoP. Verant wants people to play their game and advance themselves. If there isn't some new abilities or ways to level people would quit.<br>
<br>
If manaburn is nerfed and no compensation is given. expect a huge outroar bigger than any nerf calls you have seen. No one has quit over wizards killing kunark dragons.. People will quit if manaburn is changed drastically.<br>
<br>
oh and I perfer my idea of manaburn if it was to be changed..  Make it so manaburn has a DoT component at the end of it which can't be overwrote.. make it 15 seconds long and during that dot make it do another 2k of damage. That would prevent wizards from stacking manaburns to kill a kunark dragon unless they get some support classes and would give an added bonus to using manaburn.. Instead of a flat out nerf that will get many angry. <p><center>

VI came up with *several* ways of making it difficult to execute a simple 'holy trilogy' solution on their encounters.<br>
<br>
Dragons?  Stay in combat and try not to be feared...how easy is that to MT?  (answer:  not easy at all, even with 400+ MR and lvl 60)<br>
<br>
VS?  Even with 10 complete healing clerics, a warrior with 7k hp can get lifetapped down in a matter of a melee round if he 'goes off' with his procs.<br>
<br>
Trak?  Trak touch, anyone?  Where'd the MT go?<br>
<br>
I think the evidence points to the fact that VI designed those encounters to actually enforce 'thinking outside the Holy Trilogy' and coming up with other methods of succeeding in those encounters.<br>
<br>
It was really only with Velious that VI obviously forgo trying to design encounters to force folks not to use complete heal and a main tank...and therefore it stands to logic that Velious and Luclin are the arenas where they intended manaburn to be used as well.<br>
<br>
Personally, I've only been run over once for a raid (VS) by a manaburn crew (or duo, or whatever).  But one cannot say the opportunity for abuse is not there, no matter how you justify the benefits of the skill in other zones.<br>
<br>
Oh, and the comparison the Lifeburn is interesting...how many dragons have you seen LB'd down?  It's not granted practical aggro immunity like MB...nor does it leave the necro with the 800+ pts of rune shielding + full hit points.  ...oh, and it doesn't crit, either...<br>
<br>
I'd hate to see it nerfed for the wizard community, it's a very handy tool in some situations.  But I don't think these mobs were given much consideration during the design of the skill, and maybe that should be changed (for just Kunark boss mobs). <p>Good travels,<br>

I love the idea of instant, unresistable, massive damage for little agro - it's very much an asset on raids.  More power to the wizards.<br>
<br>
However I think it should be more limited in terms of range, casting time or whatever.  Just something to offset the fact of 6-8k unresistable damage with the chance of getting a crit.  Them getting mana back is not an issue.<br>
<br>
People pick on manaburn because it's probally more unbalanced than direcharm - which is next on the list.  Just compare the giants that enchanters DC in kael, compared to a 60 mage with epic and twice as many AA points. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showMessageRange?topicID=417.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showPrevMessage?topicID=417.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showNextMessage?topicID=417.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=20><img src=http://xtctripp101.homestead.com/files/qc/reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.emailToFriend?topicID=417.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.threadControl?topicID=417.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=417.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=417.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub54.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1">General<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm2">Role Playing<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm3">Tricks of the Trade<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm4">Trade/Buy/Sell<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13">Flame Boards<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm15">Custom Titles<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm16">Screen Shots<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm17">Ravenark sucks<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm21">Guild recruiting<option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm20">Announcements <option value="quelliousquaterstherebirthfrm5">Public Events</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#00CCFF>- </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth>Quellious Collective</a><font color=#00CCFF> - </font><a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13>Flame Boards</a> <font color=#00CCFF> - </font><br><br> <br> <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
