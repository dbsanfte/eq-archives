I believe this is true most of the time. What you do... what you teach your child when they are small is what dictates what they do when they are older. I teach 14 year olds. It is obvious when you meet the parents which parents parented and which didn't and still don't. 9 out of 10 times I can tell you that by the way a student acts long before I meet their parents. The teenager that was brought up well as a child is rarely the teenager who gets into trouble with the school authorities and the law. Every year, in every group of 8th graders we get at least one parent who basically spoiled...let run...their child and now all of a sudden does not know what to do with this teenager who is in trouble all the time...we all want to say, &quot;well, duh..did you think he would raise himself??? stupid woman (man)&quot;. <br>
<br>
I have read a lot of this thread, and skipped a lot too...but I would have to say that spanking has its place in discipline for some children and some situations and saying you just don't believe in spanking, if you have a child with the right personality, could lead to disaster. Most children, the ones who respond to spanking, who are not spanked will only turn out to be spoiled brats. THen there are those who will be kicked out for writing death threats in their journals. We get one a year. <br>
<br>
I am lucky so far and my daughter responds well to a dissaproving look and telling her she isn't being nice. She wants more than anything to be nice. She is four. Do I think this will always work? No, not likely. Do I think this is the only way to discipline her? Not at all. If she does something that might hurt her or something more serious than saying something mean to her cousin, she deserves more discipline. The trick is to match the discipline to the action...and the discipline to your child's personality (if it doesn't bother them it isn't discipline...to realize that it is your JOB to raise these kids even when it is not convenient or fun. ESPECIALLY when it is not convenient or fun, for this is when your child is learning the most.<br>
<br>
If you do your job when your children are little, most likely it won't be your child suspended for threatening teachers or other students, it won't be your child arrested for taking a gun to school, it won't be your child dead from a gunshot wound to the head after killing students and teachers at school. <br>

Do you know? If you're going to assert that hitting is the way to keep kids from doing this stuff, don't you think that's kind of an important detail? Any argument for discipline being a factor in these (teenage) children's criminal behavior is going to need some evidence other than &quot;such and such worked on me, look how I turned out&quot; or &quot;I do this to my kids, blah blah.&quot; That's anecdotal evidence, and it doesn't hold up. The fact is, by claiming to know the answers, all we're doing here is making huge assumptions that may not even have any sort of relevance to the issue. If we found that school shooters were by and large spanked as children, would that change anything? Honestly, we don't have the answers, and the answers are probably a lot more complicated than we'd like them to be, and sweeping generalizations (especially unfounded ones) just don't seem to lead to much of anything.<br>

What's going on here is a healthy conversation being enjoyed by both participants and onlookers alike.  No, we're not the all-knowing, omnipotent beings who can deem something &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; at the drop of a hat... we're just offering to each other our own opinions of the topic.  And as everyone knows, opinions are never wrong.<br>
<br>
And getting back to the topic-at-large, Trab.. I think it's safe to assume that parental guidance (be it either passive or aggressive) is critical in forming ANY child's sense of morality.  A lack of it allows for too much of a course deviation from the rest of the civilized herd - the child's sense of right and wrong could be horribly and possibly dangerously skewed.<br>

------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Of course. But there is a strong sentiment here of &quot;all these kids need is a good whooping,&quot; which is really hard to get behind. Parents obviously have a huge role in their children's lives, that can't be denied. What I can't agree with is that there is some magical sort of &quot;right way&quot; and &quot;wrong way&quot; to raise your children. That school violence can be attributed 100% to &quot;wrong&quot; parenting. Children grow up in crack houses and turn out ok. Kids that have the perfect parents turn out messed up. Some kids are psychologically messed up in ways that aren't anybody's &quot;fault.&quot; Kids are resilient enough to where small variations in parenting methods are not going to result in a completely corrupted set of morals. If you look at things across cultures, we don't all raise children the same way. Some cultures are much stricter, some are much looser, but we don't see a culture of axe murderers out there because the kids were raised a certain way. I tend to think that unless you outright abuse your children, your kids are probably going to turn out decent. Not to say that parents aren't influential, they are, but children, by nature, are highly adaptive.<br>
<br>
Although school violence is highly publicized, the majority of children don't commit violent crimes. There are far more normal children out there than there are killers, far too many for &quot;lack of discipline&quot; to be a reasonable answer. I would be interested to see case studies on these children and see what kind of homes they were raised in, but I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't any obvious answers to be found in the parenting, something you could point to and say &quot;oh, well there's where they went wrong,&quot; unless it was a case of obvious abuse (not talking spankings here. I think there are more effective ways of raising children, but I'm talking about heavy beatings, verbal abuse, sexual abuse, the kind of stuff that is severely damaging to a child's psyche). Thinking otherwise may make us feel better about how we raise our children, make us feel a certain sense of security, but in the end parents who raise their children in the best possible way still sometimes end up with the worst possible outcome. <br>

When they visit their Aunt Kiki, however, they are well behaved and listen to the first &quot;No&quot; I tell them. Why? Because I will take my hand (my hand, not any boards, belts or other foreign objects) to their behinds. So, between my sister and I, they know the difference between right an wrong.

My vote: Spanking when necessary<br>
<br>
<br>
*note* I've not had to spank them much.

I learned at an early age to think before acting... and my idea of right/wrong was basically a question of whether or not an action would result in Dad removing his belt and making a most distinctive snapping sound as he headed to the bedroom.<br>

Spanking i guess is good, its a personal prefrence to the parent really. <br>
         The main thing i see alot nowadays, is Parents beating the sh*t outta there kids, and not showing them any love or anything of that nature. If ya use that kind of punishment on your child and totally treat him/her like trash, you should be ashamed of yourself. To me, this is one of the main things that breeds these kind of teenagers. Its worse then just plain out neglecting them. Dont get me wrong, your gonna put fear in thier eyes, but they are gonna grow to hate you and not show you a ounce of respect. IMO you have to show 10 times more love for your child, then the seriousness of a spanking.<br>
Not accousing anyone or anything, that is just what i think of this.<br>
Anyways, get your kids into a sport or something, when i was in high school i didnt have time to even get in trouble really, i played baseball, water skied, played a few MUDS etc. (untill senior year &quot;whistle&quot;). At any high school theres tons of clubs and sports and extracurricular stuff for people to do, then to go home and hate thier parents. As far as the black clothing thing..I never was a big fan of it, i was in 11th grade when it was really getting big, the whole black clothing dirty goth look whatever you wanna call it. Never saw it as attractive, the kids that chose to wear that kinda stuff really didnt seem to care about thier bodies much, had peircings, tatoos etc, bad personal hygiene, shrug, they are probably all diffrent around the country. I guess its a personal thing but when you ask one of them they are like.. &quot;thats how i express myself&quot;. I was always just like ok, i guess everyones diffrent, whatever. Worst thing I thought was the boys (young adults 16-17) with black makeup and fingernails, always seemed pretty messed up to me.<br>
      Anyways kinda difted off there, but, too many parents abuse thier children these days, in this day and age, not saying spanking is abuse, it is fine, but its a 2 way bridge.<br>
Prime example:<br>
 <br>
Mom gets home from a 10 hour stressfull work shift. Is tired, has a headache, cant think straight etc (weve all been there).  Mom gets a call from neighbor saying her son broke thier window and they want money to fix it. atiredstressedoutpissedoffmom_001 finds her son and spanks him. Neither talk for the rest of the day, next day son is pissed off and home alone, then ignores the mom when she gets home, rinse repeat. <br>
Just a few thoughts, sorry for the long post <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

1.  To imply that all criminals are the result of bad parenting is a tough case to make.  Maybe I am spreading it too generally, but in essence all criminals were once kids, so its not to far of a stretch.  People make choices and far be it for me to know why they do.  <br>
<br>
2.  On parenting in general, i think that the most important things are consistency and follow through.  Without it, any punishment is nothing but a threat with the possibility of becoming a reality.  I do not have any kids, but I watch my friends interact with theirs.  It is this constant struggle for power.  Kids always trying for that extra &quot;bit&quot;.  I see how they threaten the kid with &quot;X&quot; punishment only to not enforce it when the child doesn't comply.  These are the lessons that are hard to unteach.  A. they learn that Mommy/ Daddy doesn't always mean what they say (concept of lying)  B.  that breaking the rules doesn't always have consequences.  Not meaning to sounds preachy *L* Just observations from a sompletely unqualified source <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
