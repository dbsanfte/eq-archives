I haven't read anyone crying libel. You can give your view of others all you want. &quot;That Esmalyn is a fucking bitch,&quot; while not flattering, is an opinion and not likely to tarnish my rep even with the rumor mill working overtime without examples. Backing up your opinion with speculation to give your dislike some clout, or get others to agree with you because you don't have anything on me is pretty weak considering you have to resort to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   hinting</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you're in the know but you're not doing much more than blowing hot air out your ass. Why shouldn't he get called on it? I didn't call him on it to come to Montyy's defense. I called him on it for perhaps the same reason others did: I don't want a poster with his/her game name, but especially a neutered anon, feel they are free to attach my name to anything they please in order to support their bias. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 10/6/02 10:14:54 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/unandaben.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nandaben</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Bok Wizard</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/6/02 12:41:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=555.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Esmalyn,<br>

I'll be curt with this answer. Hopefully you won't be clueless. No, I didn't mean it to be a flame, just a counterpoint. Have I grown so tame that no one can tell the difference?<br>
<br>
&quot;The important subject and heart of my post follows what you have chosen to quote.&quot;<br>

<br>
I've never made it a big deal to hide my sex. (/em waits for the puns) Other info is off limits. I am also quite aware you never called me a &quot;fucking bitch&quot; to my knowledge. However, I wanted to offer an example to back up why I thought it was okay to call Sativa out on this thread, and I decided to use myself instead of you or anyone else to avoid pissing someone off. But it seems I can't accomplish that much. I must be an anger magnet. <br>

Oh. And you think <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    your</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> comprehension is right on target? Try not jumping to conclusions.

I'm laughing so hard at this one my headache is throbbing. I am in the habit of truncating names, and since you wanted to go by the moniker &quot;nandaben&quot; I thought it harmless to shorten it to &quot;nand.&quot; Oh yes, I capitalize too. See boys and girls? A little extra attention to your spelling/grammar pays off.<br>
<br>
Opting to go anonymous was really smart, eh? Thankfully most people can’t turn their conscious off as easily as their names. Next time opt for something that doesn’t so closely resemble your in-game name. With any dumb luck you might be able to keep the ruse going. Another one shot in the foot.<br>

Pun as expected. But did I write, &quot;Nand is a grammar criminal?&quot; Or did I write, &quot;Nand called me a 'fucking bitch?'&quot; If I can't use myself to illustrate a point in an example or use an expression involving more than two words because you take them literally, or think they are focused on you to the exclusion of all others (eg.

Alos, please note that I put libel in quotes e.g. &quot;libel&quot;  infering that it was not meant by me to be taken at it's strict legal meaning. I don't think anyone intends to sue anyone.

No problem. But! (There had to be a but...)<br>
<br>
I was just saying that nobody libeled someone in their own guild, in Nindail's case. That was an opinion, not like passing your belief for truth that [Nindail] avoided training uber guilds, but not others, without proof, like Sativah tried to pull off with Montyy.<br>
<br>

<br>
Emphasis mine. Yes, this is exactly what Sativah was trying to get away with and called on. But you (generic, hint hint) can't say it's libel for calling anons with an axe to grind spineless, which I thought you were inadvertently defending. The anon Sativah, that is.<br>
