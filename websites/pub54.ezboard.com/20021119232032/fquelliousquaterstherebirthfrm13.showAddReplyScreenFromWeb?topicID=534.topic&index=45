How in the hell would getting Shissar stolen from us in Fear give us a bad track record Erana?  <br>
<br>
As for Hate.  If you referring to Friday night, it was Radiant that was trained by UP.  UP can deny it all they want, but running into safe camp from port up, after I had already made the run aggro free, does not bring you mobs from the second floor of the Cleric House even if you do aggro some mobs on the way to camp.  We may have aggro'd a few on the way to camp, but there is absolutely no way that Drake would have ended up in our camp unless UP went and got it. <br>
<br>
I was not on last night, so I will not comment on the Cazel incident, but Kiting a mob around the zone waiting on sufficient force does not constitute engagement.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ulordvaghrisbloodreaver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Vaghris Bloodreaver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Knife of R'holaer</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(9/22/02 10:09:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=534.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Good ole Radiant? eh?</span><hr size=1> Erana...what in the blue fuck are you talking about? No, personally i dont know anything about a &quot;ragefire&quot; incident. I DO know, in fact, of the Fear one you speak of. And I'm still trying to figure out how the bloody hell that gives US a bad track record. Let me break it down for you, incase you missed the...oh...18 page flame about it, in which you must have missed the whole damn thing. WoS was pulled by Bippity, and was going to continue reeling it into a sufficient force of people with, again, the immediate intent of killing WoS for the enchanter epic. Verbo ran up and did his damnest to steal agro back from Bip and ran it as well as a quite a few roamers into the ADD camp. Now, where in all that, did Radiant become the badguy to receive your &quot;bad track record&quot;? There's log of it, which Bippity posted to show that we had it engaged first and was otw back to the group in order to kill it. We had this ks'd --from us-- though we had a) sufficient force (which in the end, thats what it comes down to) and b) intent to kill WoS. <br>
<br>
Yes, i know this is really digging into the buried past, but it seems that a blight of ignorance has spawned from Ulwern and infected Erana in the process. What goddamn right do you have to say Radiant has a bad track record eh? Fear was a tad different then Cazel, Erana. We got screwed hard though we, in fact, had force enough to lay claim to him. If Amaya had sufficient force (hot damn, its like im trying to impress something upon you), obviously Radiant would have backed off, seeing as it was, engaged with the immediate intent to kill. ~cough~ Read below, though i know Ravenark isnt defending anyone or taking sides, he states it rather clearly.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;Technically, engaging is not kiting around a mob waiting for others to show up.

<br>
now, seeing there wasnt sufficient force (theres that word again, maybe its stuck in your head by now) on behalf of UP to take Cazel, and having waited for forces to arrive on our side which was 20 or so minutes after the initial telling that Cazel was up, decided to take him, because people were getting impatient. No rules were broken in doing this, though some might say morals come into play. To some, yes, to other, no, its a pure case by case basis. I'm sure Verbo felt he had every right to take WoS and nail his head above the collective fireplace of ADD, if morals are that matter.  <p><br>
