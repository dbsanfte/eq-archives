<br>
     This is Azile.  Before I say anything at all, I'd like to apologize to all those that were trained, died, and didn't get to kill Sev.  I had no idea things were going as you state they were.<br>
<br>
    This was the perspective from which I saw everything...  Ryo sent me a tell asking if I wanted in to manaburn Sev.  I said &quot;sure&quot;, as all my big mob manaburning experiences had been good ones, thus far.  Ryo had told us that she worked a deal with the raid in progress that if they had sufficient numbers first, that we would back down.  I had no reason to believe otherwise.  She also told us that she had a druid puller, but that the druid had died.  She told us nothing of passing the other raid, or of training the other raid.  I can only assume that 1 of 2 things happened: 1) the training was accidental, in a failed pull, or 2) the training was malignant.  In either case, I see that the raid that was forming was sorely wronged.  I am sorry for that fact.  I will try to send tell to Ryo in game, and settle this with tells.  I suspect that Ryo may have been dishonest with me, but I don't want to point any fingers without having gotten the other side of the story.  In the meanwhile, I'd like to make ammends if I can.  The loot isn't that important to me, especially if so many people were hurt.  If the raid leader could send me a tell in game, I'd be happy to work out some type of compromise.  Again, what I'd most like to emphasize is that I am very sorry that people were needlessly and thoughtlessly trampled upon.<br>
<br>
         I am not likely to come back to this board, as I generally do not read the flame boards (eq can be stressful enough).  If you still take issue with me personally, then please send me a tell in game.  I am online MANY hours, and can be easily reached.  I'd much rather try to make ammends with people, than have someone angry at me.  Again, I'm so sorry things went so wrong.<br>
<br>

<br>
omg my name is in here.<br>
<br>
ok, heres my side of what happened.<br>
<br>
like azile i get a tell from ryohki asking if i want to mb sev, i figure sure since ive been promising noobas a green scale for 3 weeks now,and possibly ill get it today.so i port to ej and evac to our normal spot, i believe i was 2nd to last to arrive.i get rdy and sit and wait. in group after we got all settled and rdy were 5 wizards, no puller in group but was told we had puller so cool. someone in group mentions db in zone and ryohki says she made a deal with them that if they get 20 peeps in zone before we are rdy we will back off. i think they had like maybe 12-13 peeps in zone at the time, i honestly dont remember. then ryohki says sev inc so we get into position, puller dead. sit back down. get tell from pala asks me if manteca is in group or with us i say no,which at the time i didnt know was our puller.puller was bound in zone i guess so sev inc again pretty soon after death, another puller death. ryohki then tells us to follow her up a little closer cause her puller is to slow or something, i really dont remember, so we all move up, for some reason sev runs by us as we run to new spot ryohki wants us at, i figured our puller had her kited, this is when things get a little confusing,she said puller lost track so she has us following her around platue till we see sev again,we burn loot and bail.<br>
<br>
about 5 min goes by and i get a tell from pala,asking if we mbed sev, i say yes and he freaks. im like wtf, that was the deal wasnt it? he tells me what deal?  this is when i start to feel like shit and realize ive been duped.i should have known something was up,but being in the state of mind i was at the time, i had just woken up from drinking all night,and was excited to maybe get a scale for a warrior that has been watching for sev for 3 weeks, i didnt do what i normally would have. i didnt ask raid myself,i didnt question what i was being told. all mistakes i see now and i apalogize to db for this.i didnt win shit for loot that day, a dragon bone bracelet, but ill hand it over np regardless,what happened i feel isnt right and im ashamed of myself for not questioning what was going on.<br>

Is when the other raid was joking about the 20min thing Ryohki thought they meant it and went ahead like that and after the 20min tried to pull and died... guess the other raid was in the way or something and died... then kept trying to pull and finally got it.  <br>
<br>
Once again it seems there was a total lack of communication on both sides or atleast a misunderstanding..<br>
but again if a regular raid is already there... should just let them have it... all these rolling things and 20min things really arent fair to that raid... if wizards get it you got 30 disappointed people... if the raid gets it you got 5 disappointed people.. see the difference? There will always be more dragons that there is no raid at. <p><center>

now that you see im a good artist,most of the time raids gather on the steps,and the puller has to pull next to the steps to get the dragon to burners,lets say the pull dies sumwhere in the middle,dragon starts roaming back and bam aggros other raid if unlucky.Picture is not perfect but you get the idea.And about the nerfing thing,I was just proving that whatever VI does its usualy because money,and 2 of the things you stated(server changes and changin your name) costs 50 bucks,and alot of people would pay for that.<br>

Keraway, well..honestly i dont know him much, but from what i heard from many others he is a jerk..but that is beside the point...i dont know keraway and i dont have an opinion on him...<br>
<br>
<br>
Im still thinking that this was a big miscommunication issue, mixed with a tad of greed on the puller part.  I DONT think that jama trained them on purpose, it just seems very unlikely, given what i know of jama.  I honestly believe jama thought, well they dont have the numbers we agree'd to and begin to pull the dragon, died and caused aggro on the other raid and then tried again, died again..etc etc.  The sloppiness of the pull was probably due to the fact that he was rushing the pull because he was excited to MB sev. *shrug* i dont know, and honestly i think it is all dumb.  Should he or any of those wizards have even been there in the first place is another issue...I personally dont see any reason a person like jama, keroway or azile should have anything to do with severilious...Just leave this shit alone, and no one would have to worry about these kinda things happening...Killing severilious by ANY MB wizard is for pure greed or profit imo...most MB wizards are in guilds that are far beyond Sev loot levels...<br>
<br>
I guess people could say they MB Kunark Dragons for fun..but wtf...how is pressing 1 button and watching a thing die fun? it isnt challenging, it isnt teamwork, it isnt anything except rewarding.  You get phat lewts FAST!<br>
<br>
no reason for this nonsense...people get so fucking swept up with loot and status in this game it makes you loose sight to the fact that you play this game with other people...respect em for christ sake.<br>

Still ignoring the bullshit side of that deal.<br>
<br>
As for miscommunications... if this shit keeps up, guilds are going to adapt a clear-cut, no holds back method of announcing their intentions to get their message across: WE ARE KILLING THIS MOB AND YOU BEST KEEP AWAY! YOU HEAR US? WE'RE FUCKING RAIDING IT AND NO WE ARE NOT MAKING AN &quot;AGREEMENT&quot; WITH ANYONE ABOUT IT!<br>
<br>
Clear enough? And unfortunately rude since some are unable to detect sarcasm, and/or too lazy to confirm, and/or too eager to jump in without a second thought.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>

I know human error happens but the &quot;cause&quot; for these MB threads are annoyingly similar. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uakser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aKSer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/6/02 12:00:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=451.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: trend</span><hr size=1> Fkin who are you?

<br>
Yes I am sure as a purely objective reporter of fact you were just reporting others words because hey! Its important that people know that some namesless people say hes a jerk and your *really* have no opinion - omg the story of the century way to go! /sarcasm off.<br>
