Los Angeles player representative Paul Lo Duca, who revealed the agreement, was scolded by players on the conference call for misstating it. Lo Duca said the deal covered mandatory random testing for steroids, marijuana and cocaine, but other players corrected him Wednesday.<br>

<br>
as for &quot;they make enough money&quot;  Who decides that?  Baseball is not an easy sport mind you.. Also it is grueling cause you have to constantly practice and be away from your family. Perhaps more so than anyother sport cause the season is so long. People want to pay lots to see their favorites play but is Alex Rodriguez really worth 25 mil a season to the fans who want to see him?<br>
<br>
Baseball is in need of fixing though.. Even without strikes it has been a dying sport cause of the faster paced action of racing, basketball, football and other sports like them.. People nowadays want action and they feel baseball is boring cause its slow paced.. Also fans of consistantly losing teams have been complaining for years cause they say they can't compete when another team offers tons more money to their players they can't afford to keep. The Royals are a good example cause they had a load of talented offensive stars but had to dump them because they couldn't afford them and are stuck in a losing spiral.. <br>
<br>
While it isnt a given, teams can pay large amounts of money for free agents win a world series and then dump them (Marlins come to mind).  Personally I believe all trades and free agent signings should be better regulated.. No more should a team be able to dump a good player on a team that likes to pay (Yankees) and pick up a buttload of prospects.  <br>
<br>
All trades should be reasonably fair cause when not regulated teams are more likely to push the system.  Also a 100 million payroll tax should be implimented next year and that would increase 20 million every 3 years...I don't like out and out salary caps cause they stagnate a good team. It is very evident in football cause no team has really dominated for a while. The rams are close but one day their players will want too much and they will falter. <p><center>

<br>
I cant believe that the players would actually have the nerve to stop their season of play, just because they dont want to test for steroids. <br>
<br>
Think of all the people who have seasons passes? Think of little Billy's ticket that Daddy bought him for the Sept 20something game, that little Billy looks at everyday, and cant wait to go to, because it'll be his birthday -- oh wait, their might be a strike - game cancelled. <br>
<br>
I feel strongly on this one, as for it &quot;not being easy&quot; or however you put it for Baseball players Gaelron, imo you're way off man. <br>
<br>
Think of it, they're being paid millions (hundreds of thousands even if you ride the bench) just to play their FAVORITE game for 3 hours one day. Practices? Yah they practice for an hour, sometimes 2 before the game, then they play a 3 hour game. .. They have a 5 hour workday. I wont even get into all the other perks, that a normal joe doesnt see in his little 9-5 cubicle dull setup. Have it hard? No way. <br>
<br>
What if you said that an EQ Game Tester, (not GM mind you, just QA tester), that gets paid $10-15 an hour went on strike. Would you say:<br>
<br>
&quot;they have it hard, they have to meet certain deadlines, they have to find certain issues in games, and do certain tests over and over with different setups and situations and environments, it can get boring or repetitive -- and they have to do it everyday, they only get a 1 hour lunch break from it all!&quot; <br>
<br>
No! You wouldnt! because you see, they're doing it because  they -love- video games, and probably -love- Everquest, and wouldnt trade their job for the world, paid to play eq! (not counting advancement or a higher paying job to support a family)<br>
<br>
<br>
Same with Baseball players. They are getting paid (tons! omg can you imagine how much?) to do something they LOVE, hell pitchers only play once a week! <br>
<br>
Dont get me wrong, I've been playing baseball as a hobby with buds, and at school back in the day all my life, I know it takes great skill, talent, and practice to ever make it to the big leagues, but dont you dare tell me they have it hard. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
No offense meant Gaelron. <br>

But I had to attempt to shake some sense into you. <br>

I love baseball, but when shit like this strike happens, it really burns my ass.<br>
<br>
Baseball, basketball, and hockey all have one thing in common.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> GUARANTEED CONTRACTS.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  This is something that the most grueling sport of all, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> AMERICAN FOOTBALL</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> does not have.  This is wrong.<br>
<br>
Look at this realistically.  The owners are asking the union to do something that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NO OTHER COMPANY IN THE WORLD WOULD ASK IT'S EMPLOYEES TO DO, WHICH IS TO SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY CAN MAKE.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I mean seriously, say your boss comes up to you and says, you know, I am willing to pay you 50k a year to do your job, but I want you to take 25k, wouldn't you hold out for more?  That is basically what the baseball owners are doing, they are asking the players to make the owners police themselves.  <br>
<br>
No one held a gun to the owner of the Texas Rangers and forced him to sign A-Rod to a 252 million dollar contract.  He wanted the best player in baseball, and he did what he felt he had to do in order to get him.  If he didn't feel that he could afford it, or make enough off of team revenue to pay for it, then what the fuck was he doing signing the contract???<br>
<br>
If the owners want the players to make decisions on their own salaries, limiting them to the amount they can make, then they need to go into partnership with the players, making them part owners, so that their salaries are linked to the teams they play for.  <br>
<br>
I wish to hell they would just quit bitching, and PLAY FUCKING BASEBALL!!! <p><center><a target="new"href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30880">Rhes Olooshun - 59th Preserver</a></center>

Anyway<br>
<br>
You misinterpreted what i meant.. I didnt say players deserve large salaries I just gave examples on why they may. Didnt input an opinion there.. <br>
<br>
My opinion would be they make enough money.. Baseball can't really get anymore expensive than it is already.. Though Football hockey and basketball aren't cheap either.<br>
<br>
Don't forget baseball is entertainment therefore people are willing to shell out tons of cash to watch it among other things.  Where there is big money there is people who want as much as they can get.<br>
<br>
I can see why people don't want salary caps or restrictions but I don't agree.. I feel people need to be restricted in some ways or things will get out of control..<br>
<br>
Who says 10 years from now a player won't be making 50 million a year maybe sooner... Does anyone actually want that much money?  I guess if they spend more it will help the economy by themselves heh.<br>
<br>
<br>
However I agree with what Rhes said... Just play the damn game... Wait until the offseason to resolve this.. Got lots of time then.<br>

Even if the players have legitimate claims people just won't listen cause they make a lot more than the common person. <p><center>

<br>
HOWEVER!<br>
<br>
Players dont assume the risk of running a franchise.  You cant just add up the profit of a successful club and go ok the bulk of this should go to the players.  Thats bull.  A club purchaser assumes huge risk.  in a well formed market a baseball team will sale at a resonable value + how much risk the buyer is willing to assume (ie how rosy does the buyer see the ticket sales).  the buyer willing to see it the rosiest pays the most.  RISK.  Also keep in mind a non saleing owner assumes risk by NOT SALEING.  if a owner doesnt sale when his club has a resonable value to someone else the owner takes the chance that the club wont get into a ticket saleing rut.  RISK.<br>
<br>
Players dont assume that risk.  tickets dont sale; they loose nothing.   They get traded to a team with high ticket sales cause their contract is to expensive for the guy that errantly assumed to much risk.  Yet when thats not true players want a piece of the profit like that risk wasnt a factor.<br>
<br>
Players are eventually going to ask for to much cause of that risk the owners assume for them.  Eventually.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uzhale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zhale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/30/02 11:06:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=492.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Baseball Strike - Reality Break...</span><hr size=1> I received this plea in the mail.  I don't usually pass messages like this one on, but this one seemed so much more effective than other ones in the past.  If you can help, please do so...<br>
<br>
Since September 11, 2001, Americans have come together as never before in our generation. We have banded together to overcome tremendous adversity. We have weathered direct attacks on our own soil, wars overseas, corporate scandal, layoffs, unemployment, stock price plunges, droughts, fires, <br>
and a myriad of economic and physical disasters both great and small. But now, we must come together once again to overcome our greatest challenge yet.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of Major League Baseball (MLB) players in our very own nation are living at, just below, or in most cases far above a seven-figure salary level. And as if that weren't bad enough they could be deprived of their life-giving pay for several months, possibly longer, as a result of the upcoming strike situation.<br>
<br>
But you can help! For only $20,835 a month, about $694.50 a day (that's less than the cost of a large screen projection TV) you can help an MLB player remain economically viable during his time of need. This contribution by no means solves the problem as it barely covers the annual minimum salary, but it's a start, and every little bit will help!<br>
<br>
Although $700 may not seem like a lot of money to you, to a baseball player it could mean the difference between spending the strike golfing in Florida or on a Mediterranean cruise. For you, seven hundred dollars is nothing more than a month's rent, half a mortgage payment, two unemployment checks,<br>
or a month of medical insurance with COBRA, but to a baseball player, $700 willpartially replace his daily salary. Your commitment of less than $700 a day will enable a player to buy that home entertainment center, trade in the year-old Lexus for a new Ferrari, or enjoy a weekend in Rio.<br>
<br>
HOW WILL I KNOW I'M HELPING? Each month, you will receive a complete financial report on the player you sponsor.  Detailed information about his stocks, bonds, 401(k), real estate, and other investment holdings will be mailed to your home. Plus, upon signing up for this program, you will receive an unsigned photo of the player lounging during the strike on a<br>
beach somewhere in the Caribbean (for a signed photo, lease include an additional $150). Put the photo on your refrigerator to remind you of other peoples' suffering.<br>
<br>
HOW WILL HE KNOW I'M HELPING? Your MLB player will be told that he has a SPECIAL FRIEND who just wants to help in a time of need. Although the player won't know your name, he will be able to make collect calls to your home via special operator in case additional funds are needed for unforeseen<br>
expenses.<br>
<br>
YES, I WANT TO HELP! I would like to sponsor a striking MLB player. My preference is checked below:<br>
[ ] Infielder<br>
[ ] Outfielder<br>
[ ] Starting Pitcher<br>
[ ] Ace Pitcher<br>
[ ] Entire team (Please call our 900 number to ask for the cost of a specific team - $10 per minute)<br>
[ ] Alex Rodriguez (Higher cost due to his $252 million contract: $60,000 per day)<br>
<br>
Please charge the account listed below $694.50 per day for the player for the duration of the strike. Also, please send me a picture of the player I have sponsored. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugypsysongman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gypsy Songman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken Lout</span><br>  Posts: 320<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/31/02 6:38:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=492.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.houston.rr.com/neuromt/pwned.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Baseball Strike - Reality Break...</span><hr size=1> I'll only say this about the baseball strike.<br>
<br>
I used to love going to Ranger games when I was a kid. I have numerous bright red bats in my closet at home, from bat night (remember those? I LOVED bat night). On a shelf, high up in a closet, wrapped in a blanket, is one of those bats signed by George Brett, along with my ticket stub from that game. I was 5 years old when I walked up to him and asked him for his autograph. It's still a thrilling moment in my life.<br>
<br>
I just started watching baseball again last year, because I was disgusted after the first one. I was all for the scabs, cause they were playing out of love, not for more money than they could spend in a lifetime.<br>
<br>
I'm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> never</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> watching baseball again. Spoiled rich fuckin' brats, who think that just cause they can hit a homer the sun rises out of their @ssholes. There used to be decency in the sport. Now it's a bunch of whiny, struting cocks.<br>

<br>
Let's look at what they get paid to do:<br>
Spend 80%+ of their time on defense JUST STANDING THERE.<br>
Spend 95%+ of their time on offense SITTING IN THE DUGOUT.<br>
<br>
The only people who actually are constantly in motion on defense are the catcher and the pitcher (the pitcher who pitches maybe once a week?)  And they get paid millions to do these incredibly painful tasks!!!!<br>
<br>
I'm not knocking people who play baseball for fun, it does provide some measure of physical activity and if that's the way you choose to exercise then more power to you.  However people who do this for a living and are getting paid these outrageous sums of money need to wake the hell up and smell the coffee.  <br>
<br>
On top of all that baseball players are a bunch of pansies who need to learn a few lessons from the NHL.  You get your face sliced open on a skate or get a cut above your eye from a stick you go get it stitched up and get right back in the game.  A baseball player would put themself on the 15 day DL for the same exact kind of injury.  Take a look at soccer players as well (football for the euros).... they run for 2 45 minute halves with one fifteen minute break inbetween.  No time outs and a total of 3 substitutions from which they are not allowed to re-enter the game.  <br>
<br>
It's just pathetic... baseball players are getting paid an outrageous sum to sit on their asses a majority of the time they are &quot;working&quot; and they want MORE.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A> at: 8/31/02 8:54:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaelron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gaelron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sebilite Guardian</span><br>  Posts: 773<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/31/02 4:23:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=492.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Baseball Strike - Reality Break...</span><hr size=1> NHL players get paided a lot too but not as much as Baseball cause it isnt as popular..<br>
<br>
So how much should players get paided anyway then?<br>
<br>
5mil a year? 2mil? 1mil? 500k?  100k?<br>
<br>
Think about if the max salary was 100k and baseball still cost as much as it does now... Where would that extra money go?  The owners!<br>
<br>
I don't think players just want more money...  They want a greater share of what the owners get..  <br>
<br>
Entertainment these days are getting more and more expensive by the year... Its called inflation... Movie tickets cost like 10 dollars per person where I am..  Other sports cost way more than baseball (football anyone?)  Even video games are going up in price.<br>
<br>
Also don't totally blame the players their agents are the ones who usually get them their outrageous contracts (Scott Boras anyone?) <br>
<br>
Its a share of the blame amongst everyone.. Just remember there are a lot of players who just play out of fun and don't go to where all the money is but I can't blame the players who do cause people are willing to pay that much to watch them play and agents are gonna milk out all the money they can from owners.<br>
<br>
If you want to call it greed then it is everywhere in society.  Movie stars, music stars and whatever else..  What about those movie stars who make 20mil per movie! <p><center>

The answer there is NONE.  I think the owners need to wise and get profit sharing going so that the smaler market teams can compete with the places like NY, LA, and Texas (though Texas sucks ass they have alotof cash).  These are just my opinions on the subject.  I grew up a huge baseball fan and remember going to Nolan Ryan pitched games when I was in HS and have 2 balls signed by him because I used to get seats right next to the Rangers Bullpen and he would sit out there alot and work with the younger pitchers.  My step son also had a ball I think signed and thrown up to him once from the visiting teams bullpen it was great the way players used to be....can we bring back the guys with class like Nolan and Brett?<br>
<br>
NOTE:  Not sure if Detroit and Cleveland are the teams losing money but I know there are some out there those are jsut 2 I picked out of thin air. <p><html>
