<br>
Radiant had been clearing around the temple for about an hour and we were ready to pull about 5 min after ADD finishes zoning in.  Our plan was to have Tristadorn run in with DA and agro the entire temple, and run it all out into NWC to kite while me or Eadric got the shissir.  <br>
<br>
We went as planned, Trist pulled out most of the temple, but as anyone who has pulled it before would know, it is hard to get *everything* out.  Therefore, when Ead went in, he got alot of agro and kited those out - which is when I ran in.<br>
<br>
As I was running around the temple base from the western side to the eastern side, I saw Verbo, who must have had sow or  run3 on - I had SoE, which is quite a bit faster.  I ran up the ramp and into the small room at the top of the temple.  Inside were the Shissir (unagro) and at least one cube.  I ran up to the shissir and hit it once with autoattack, then backed out of the temple to avoid having my soe dispelled by the cube.  I noticed that the Shissir wasnt coming out of the hut like it should - so I cast a snare spell on it asap, but it was too late for that since I can only guess that Verbo already had the agro.  For those doubting if I agroed it first (while people from my raid made the pull possible at all, I remind you), here is the log of me engaging...<br>
<br>
<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:35 2002] Auto attack is on.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:35 2002] You appear.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:36 2002] You try to slash Wraith of a Shissir, but miss!<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:36 2002] Wraith of a Shissir hits YOU for 233 points of damage.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:36 2002] Wraith of a Shissir hits YOU for 120 points of damage.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:36 2002] Auto attack is off.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:36 2002] Wraith of a Shissir tries to kick YOU, but YOU dodge!<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:37 2002] Caladur tells Radiant:3, 'Remedy on &lt;( Maeve )&gt;'<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:37 2002] Wraith of a Shissir begins to cast a spell.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:37 2002] You resist the Stone Breath spell!<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:38 2002] Famodil tells the group, 'two in camp '<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:38 2002] Kuluvien tells Radiant:3, 'assisting shaddai'<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:42 2002] Reynic tells FERecruits:4, 'lol, I gotta ask Desj when she started on Morrel'<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:42 2002] You begin casting Tangling Weeds.<br>
[Thu Apr 11 10:24:43 2002] Your target resisted the Tangling Weeds spell.<br>
<br>
<br>
Notice that I only hit it once and got agro, notice that it exicuted a full round of attacks (hit+hit+kick+stun) all at once - it would not have done this is Verbo had already engaged the mob, the rounds would have been broken up somewhat.<br>
<br>
<br>
That is my proof that we engaged the mob first, not to mention made the pull possible.<br>

Don't forget to metion that if a monk had aggro on it, I can assure you that it would not have turned around to take 4 swipes at a druid that is trying to melee.  Not with 175 1hs skill and 175 offense.  <br>
<br>
Now way in a million years is one swipe from a druid, gonna draw that kind of aggro from a ANY class that has already gained aggro on it.  <br>
<br>
This is all I need to see.  ADD was wrong, they are mistaken if they think they pulled the mob first, and if they contest this evidence, then I condemn them as a callous bunch of kill-stealers. <p><center><a target="new"href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=30880">Rhes Olooshun - 58th Preserver</a></center>

<br>
Too many instances as of late for this to be considered BS.  It puts individuals under a lot of pressure both in ADD and outside of ADD.  <br>
<br>
Whilst I did wear the ADD tag whilst I was away playing DaoC (BOO!), I have maintained good relationships throughout.  Banelion was the only person playing me during this time.<br>
<br>
Tristadorn, I know has ALWAYS had a bad reputation (sometimes it got a little personal with people).  I wouldnt comment on specifics because that it is not my way.  <br>
<br>
I can however support Banelion.  He has been my most loyal friend for 2 1/2 years ... I would defend him until I was blue in the face.  <br>
<br>
He has, like me helped the smallest people to the largest guilds in several ways ... I will not have a bad word said about him.  <br>
<br>
Although I know the situation is on reflection, wrong, I agree ADD should have never entered PoF in the first place ... there has gotta be more to this than meets the eye.  <br>
<br>
This is a very neutral post as you will see.  I dont like guilds at each others throats or people in general, so I am hoping that some sort of solution can be found. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ugaraddorghoulbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garaddor Ghoulbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(4/12/02 9:10:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=61>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ADD - You wanted a war, you got a war.</span><hr size=1> Aye, first of all I dont have a trailer to crawl back into seeing that was repossessed because like most of you folks I play EQ all day or troll these boards. But I for one dont try to come off sounding holier than thou, and try to preach how thinsg should be because the fifteen people who post on this board say its the gospel.<br>
<br>
You all make me laugh and feel sick at the same time. Most of you folks climb up on your soapboxes and scream and scream, but act like you never done anything wrong or stepped on anybodys toes to accomplish something....I say HA!!!!.<br>
<br>
Yes, you can sling all your insults and fling your vulgarities at me all you want, the minute I do it then I am trailer trash....how pathetic. Maybe you should take a good look at yourselves in the mirror as we have been told to do so lately. You are all one sided and only see things in black and white.<br>
<br>
And for your information Banelion did try to contact Tristadorn repeatedly and even suggested to random the mob but Tristadorn said no way. But now you all will tell me that why should they have randomed the mob. Being in a Plane or in any zone for that matter, does not constitute ownership of a mob in no way shape or form. But now you all will say well what about Radiant they were there first etc. Well what about when GM came and made us random on Ragefire.....its the same freaking thing. It was a contested mob and this time Radiant was found lacking in any attempt to come to an agreement. Turn about is fair play.<br>
<br>
Now I know what will happen by you folks. You most likely for the next few weeks will become ADD snipers and take shots at us, so be it, its the nature of the beast.<br>

However this time I feel like saying a few things.<br>
<br>
1. If a guild is in a zone and clearing a path to a specific mob, then that guild has first rights to that mob. I don't care what arguments you are trying to use to justify running behind a guild, it's just plain <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   WRONG</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
2. I was near the Raegfire camp when Radiant <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   WON</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the roll against ADD. A GM-Admin and Guide was there and made both parties ROLL. Radiant Rolled a 31, and ADD Rolled a 30. Therefore the GM-Admin said Ragefire was to be awarded to Radiant FIRST. I only know this because I was trying to time Ragefire for our guild cleric Resa. (Resa ended up getting Ragefire a week later -- Gratz Resa).<br>
<br>
3. By looking at the logs that were posted on this forum and from the ADD Member admitting that Radiant was in the Plane of Fear first, it's <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   CLEAR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to me that ADD Infact KSed Radiant <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   AFTER</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Radiant cleared to the Wraith, and PULLED the wraith.<br>
<br>
Those are just my opinions from reading this thread.<br>
