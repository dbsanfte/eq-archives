So you scam people out of their stuff? What good does it do you?  Most of us catch on that your a useless peice of @#%$, no matter which character name you hide behind.  Have fun on Quel getting booted from guild after guild. Hope you had fun ninjaing aow as well. Someday you may actually decide you want some companionship of the opposite sex, and you will find your lack of morals and people skills will lead you to a miserable life of masterbation and kleenex. <br>

If you're going to announce yourself as this great scammer why don't you try hiding your identity a tad better.  Seems I win, you lose.  Seems there are quite a few people you've scammed who would kill for that information.  Seems you're going to be looking over your back quite a bit.  Seems your dad (John) has already had a nice convo with quite a few people already today.  Seems you are a complete and total fucktard who has been nothing but owned by the friends of these people you were oh so smart enough to scam.<br>
<br>
P.S.  The phone number above is actually his family's line... you can reach his personal line at 706-258-2160.<br>

Thank you come again fucktard. <p>Salta

And say what you will, Casey, what you did was not honorable. You abused someone's trust (and in the LC instance, the trust of the entire guild) to get accounts. You outsmarted no one; you simply lied and manipulated your way in to their confidences, and then shattered them.<br>
<br>
Well, sir, in the immortal words of Walter Sobchack:<br>

Do you see what happens, Larry? This is what happens. This is what happens WHEN YOU @#%$ A STRANGER IN THE ASS.<br>

And I hope you're enjoying it, because it looks to me like it's the strangers' turn.<br>

I doubt an Internet service provider in Wisconsin is servicing Georgia, but I'm on hold with tds.com's tech support as I type this to confirm.  <br>
