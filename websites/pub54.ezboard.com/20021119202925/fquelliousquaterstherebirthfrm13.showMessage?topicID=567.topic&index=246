Disagree.  If Verant was so &quot;upset&quot; over what manaburn did to kunark dragons then why didn't they change it months ago? They don't want small teams of wizards killing PoP content thats why.. <br>
<br>
Hell we maybe both right but I believe its more because of PoP content. <p><center>

<br>
Key word you keep emphasizing at your lame attempt to justify selling a rare epic drop based on the ease of killing black reavers.  TWINK.  <br>
A group of your listed composition would NOT have been able to kill a black reaver decked out the equipment available to those classes at the time Kunark came out.  How much of a challenge would killing a black reaver have been if you didn't have those Kunark, Velious, Luclin armor and weapons your twinks sport.  Or the additional hit points and AC provided by aegolism.  As Faith pointed out, a lot of people who are actively working on their epics themselves don't have access to a guild bank of various items picked up by their guild on previous raids or a higher level character to get hand me downs.  Much less an associate who is a level 60 cleric with aegolism and their epic.  Spare me the &quot;I wanted a challenge.&quot; riff.  You did it because you were bored and were secure in the safety of your advanced gear, buffs, and healing spells available.<br>
<br>
&quot;And availability DOES count you idiot, thats the whole point myself and others are trying to make, but as per your usual, you completely avoid that.&quot;<br>
<br>
The only idiot here is people like you who think increased availability automatically means the chances of a desired end result automatically increase as well.  <br>
By your reasoning you would rather use two decks of cards rather than one deck if someone offered to pay you one thousand dollars to try and draw the ace of spades in a single attempt.  There's two aces in two decks, therefore increased availability.<br>
<br>
and  &quot;Sev IS caped 24/7 so its harder for a war or pally to kill him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Severilous is NOT camped around the clock 24/7.  The effort put into a Severilous camp is more along the lines of someone making a mini radar detector and parking it Emerald Jungle then logging in near the expected spawn time to see if he's up and sitting around waiting.  Or maybe taking the druid alt, porting in and sifting through track.<br>
He's only a contested spawn if more than one group is aware he's up and makes it to him at approximately the same time.  If a group of wizards port in and kill him while Random Warrior_01 is grouped somewhere in Maidens Eye at the same time, then its hardly a contest.  And expecting them to leave a dragon alone because some warrior &quot;might&quot; come along later with an interest is an unlikely and assinine expectation as something to the effect of your guild being buffed and prepared to kill the Arch Lich in Ssra and stepping aside because Wraith just entered the zone and says they need a drop from the same snake.<br>

Sev = 1 dragon.<br>
Black Reaver's = possibly 1000 in the same amount of time that Sev takes to spawn.<br>

Oh come on. No one solos their entire epic, and all epics require a raid type force for at LEAST one fight, everyone knows this. <br>
<br>
Screw the loot and drops, its more about an encounter. (WHICH IS ALSO WHAT MONTYY IS SAYING.) Black Reaver fight, sure, it COULD be exciting if you're pretty new to the 50+ game. But dragons without MB? That was always fun.<br>
<br>

<br>
That does mean increased availability, along as the odds being the EXACT same as pulling an ace from a single deck. The second one's odds are alot worse, but they are POSSIBLE instead of 0. <br>
<br>
A POSSIBLE thing is more available then a IMPOSSIBLE thing, wouldn't you think?<br>
<br>
Kill Sev once per his spawn time, POSSIBLY get a scale.<br>
Kill Reavers 1000 times in the same amount of time, POSSIBLY get 0-1000 reavers.<br>
<br>
It's all in luck.<br>
<br>
And I still don't see a group of 60's killing a dragon without Manaburn. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
You CANT compare Severlious to Reavers in CoM.  You just cant.  Sev is a what? 5 - 7 day spawn or something?  Reavers are always up?  Then you have green scale as a rare drop off Sev and you pretty much can get a jade reaver in just about every clearing of Reavers.  HUGE fucking difference here.  These epic items are in completely different categories.<br>
<br>
Your deck of cards analogy doesnt work at all Millikin.  It makes no sense in relation to Sev and Reavers.  Every time ive been to CoM to help a friend get jade reavers one has dropped within the first 9 kills.  Ive killed Sev 4 times and never seen a green scale off him.  So thats 1 jade reaver out of every 9 kills (1:9) and (lets say it was just bad luck) and its 1 out of 4 (1:4) on Sev.  You can get 9 reaver kills multiple times in one day.  You CANT get more than 1 Sev kill in a day.  Its unlikely youll get more than 1 in a single week.  Availability is a HUGE issue that makes these two items impossible to compare along the same lines.<br>
<br>
lets recap:<br>
<br>
1:4 chances off scale on Sev<br>
1:9 chances of jade reaver on Reavers<br>
thats about twice as likely to see a scale drop off Sev as to see a jade reaver off a Reaver.<br>
<br>
but<br>
<br>
1 Sev spawn per week<br>
(lets estimate an easy 3 clearings of Reavers per day which is very doable) 21 sets of Reavers in a week<br>
thats 21 times as many sets of Reavers as Sev spawns.<br>
<br>
1:4 on Sev means 4 weeks to get a scale.<br>
in that same 4 weeks you get 84 jade reavers (64:4)<br>
<br>
1:4 compared to<br>
84:4<br>
<br>
Can you see how BIG of a difference there is here?  Heck you can even half that for being used for two diff class epics.  Thats 42!  42 TIMES as many jade reavers in the same time span.<br>
<br>
And I would never call a jade reaver a 'rare' epic drop.  Pick pocketing my dorf note from Kaladim took me 4 and a half hours the second time.  Thats a hell of a lot rarer than jade reavers and I wouldnt even come close to considering either of those rare drops compared to epic items like green scales and mage cloaks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/umontyydaogre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Montyy Da Ogre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Anti Manaburn<br>Fat Ass <font color=orange>Flame King</font></span><br>  Posts: 255<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(10/17/02 9:20:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=567.topic&index=251>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Yeah Milikin, Syllies 40 rogue twink with her rygorr armor pieces and her uber bloodpoint so much outclasses most player this server <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I gues you don't see my point, if a group consisting of the 4 I stated can kill black reavers, than 1 or 2 full groups of people with sub par equipment prolly can.  And with todays EQ economy, everyone post 50 has decent gear (at least by kunark standards which is at the level black reavers are)<br>
<br>
And to shut up FK up before she starts throughing another barage of quotes at me.... My gripe with Manaburn was about removing content, it gave 6 people the ability to do what no other group of 6 could do, because of this mid level players could not compete to kill dragons to get epic drops and dragon haste (dragon haste being just as important to a melee IMO)  Killing uncontested reavers is not removing content, seeing as someone could form a group to kill them at almost any time.  And to touch on what Quas an Autty said, NONE of us know anyone who needs a Jade Reaver, so we sold them... boo us!<br>

Sure I can duo with a pally and they can heal us but their dps isn't as great so it's a trade off.  Sure I can duo with a druid that nukes mob and heals pet but again their dps and the fact that my pet is sucking up more exp causes there to be a trade off.<br>

In all honesty I do agree with Openhand though, up the ac cap on plate classes and maintain a lower cap for monks.

<br>
Hi! I'm Scott. I would respectfully request that if you're going to quote me, the entire quote be used, as opposed to just the first half of it, and would like to clarify some reasoning while I'm here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
TaralonD summarized the primary reason for the Mana Burn change very wel in the the third paragraph of his post, which is also available here (eqlive.station.sony.com/c...?id=5211<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  in the sixth paragraph, if you prefer. <br>
<br>
<br>
Once again, that is the primary reason for the change to Mana Burn. Simply put, we couldn't develop an expansion that had fun high end encounters while this ability was left untouched.<br>
<br>
<br>
A later paragraph in the same update reads: &quot;In addition to the problem described above.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;In addition&quot; is supposed to further clarify that the &quot;Manaburn Team&quot; concept was the secondary reason for the change. As the author of that paragraph, I truly apologise if the meaning was not clear enough. If it was not, that is absolutely my fault.<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, at the previous Fan Faire, I absolutely did, in the Producers and Developers panel, make the following statement. (Which tends to make more sense when seen in its entirety.)<br>
<br>
&quot;Right now, we have no intention of changing Mana Burn on anything other than potentially Red servers. At the moment, it isn't being a problem. If it proves to be a problem later, we'll address it then.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The unavoidable truth is: Situations change, and going into Planes of Power, it became a significant content balancing problem.<br>
<br>
<br>
..and that, friend, is why the entire Development Update began with the statement, &quot;Just like everyone else, we're people. People make mistakes,&quot; and ended with an apology.<br>
<br>
To summarize that three page letter into one considerably more brief sentence: <br>
<br>
&quot;We made a mistake in our initial assessment of the skill, and we owe you an apology for that.&quot;<br>
<br>
Which remains the absolute truth. <br>

The second one's odds are alot worse, but they are POSSIBLE instead of 0.&quot;<br>
<br>
And this is why increased availability does not automatically mean increased chances.  Variables come into play.<br>
Your citation that a possibility of 1000 reavers spawning in a week automatically means someone is going to get a jade reaver is flawed because you are failing to take into account variables like people being unable to to stay online continuously for one week, the fact that someone else is likely to pass through etc.<br>
<br>
Kailynn states:  &quot;Your deck of cards analogy doesnt work at all Millikin. It makes no sense in relation to Sev and Reavers. Every time ive been to CoM to help a friend get jade reavers one has dropped within the first 9 kills. Ive killed Sev 4 times and never seen a green scale off him.&quot;<br>
<br>
It does apply.  I've gone on some dozen or so Severilous kills.  He's always dropped at least one scale.  Based on that fact, I could say that he has a 100% drop rate.  I wouldn't say that because its not taking into account times I haven't participated in killing him.<br>
<br>
&quot;1:4 chances off scale on Sev<br>
1:9 chances of jade reaver on Reavers<br>
thats about twice as likely to see a scale drop off Sev as to see a jade reaver off a Reaver.&quot;<br>
<br>
Key word in both cases is chance.  Chance does not mean reality, and law of averages is going to come into play a lot more often in the latter case.<br>
<br>
<br>
Montyy states:  &quot;Yeah Milikin, Syllies 40 rogue twink with her rygorr armor pieces and her uber bloodpoint so much outclasses most player this server.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her gear compared to someone else's of her level has no bearing on the fact that all of your gear is far and away better than the gear available to those classes at the time Kunark came out.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I gues you don't see my point, if a group consisting of the 4 I stated can kill black reavers, than 1 or 2 full groups of people with sub par equipment prolly can.&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I see that point quite clearly.  The part you're glossing over is that while an encounter is trivial to someone with the right gear it is certainly not trivial to someone with lower quality equipment.<br>
<br>
Since you all are so hung up on the concept of &quot;stealing content&quot; (I never said that by the way.) and subjective value of one object versus another look at it this way.  The comparative value doesn't change the act.  If you steal a Rolls Royce or a Nissan Stanza, its still grand theft auto.  And it doesn't matter if you needed help to disable the car alarm or found the keys in the ignition.<br>
<br>
BTW:  Verant doesn't care one iota about manaburn trivializing Kunark dragons for farming.  The nice new triggerable Ragefire complete with old loot tables is proof.<br>
