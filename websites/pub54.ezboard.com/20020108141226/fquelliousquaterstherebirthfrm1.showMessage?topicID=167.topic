<br>
I believe, plain and simple:<br>
1) you must be within visual range of where the mob spawns.<br>
2) you must be loged in as the character that will use or engage the spawn.<br>
3) you answer camp checks within a timely maner to your right to the spawn.<br>
<br>
** acceptions<br>
1) you get trained on and have to zone. in this case, you should, depending on the zone and mob, be giving propor ammount of time to get back to your original position.<br>
<br>

I don't even like talking about rights.  No one has the right to anything, no one deserves to be given anything.  You don't have the right to be entitled to Journeyman's Boots, you don't have the right to be entitled to Lamentations, you don't have the right to be entitled to your epic weapon.  Not everyone will get these items, nor should they.  You have to compete against other players to get these, while being mindful both of the PnP and of common courtesy, which itself goes a lot farther with some people than others.<br>
<br>
Now, the semantics of who has the right to what aside, if you show courtesy to others you usually can expect courtesy in return.  If you kill-steal from people, word does travel and you'll eventually end up paying for it.  Of course, in my opinion, if you try to paint whole guilds as evil organizations due to the actions of a few, that also makes you come off as a rather.. little person.  Bitter, judgmental, and shortsighted.  But that's just my opinion, and it probably belongs over on the flame boards. *Looks innocent*<br>

<br>
So this can get quite tricky, and you have that two-sided coin for almost any instance in which a spawn-dispute may arise.<br>
<br>
Ok, lets discuss this topic as it was a very 'hot' issue in my other post.  Let me show ya..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   you must be within visual range of where the mob spawns.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well what about a random outdoor spawn, or a mob with placeholders in several locations?  Let me think of an easy example. Hrmm, the frenzied ghoul.  Most frenzy groups set up and hold &quot;camp&quot; in a room where they can not &quot;See&quot; the spawn when it pops. For most, civil, people, they see a group call &quot;Frenzy&quot; and they will respect that the spawn is camped.  Yet is someone really wanted to be an ass about it, they, technically, would not be breaking the rules to sit in the frenzy room itself can begin to camp it.  I actually remember this happening before Kunark came out, guk being so crowded at times that there were groups actually camping each individual spawn. Basically, the ___ + friends camping is the invention of the player-base.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  you must be loged in as the character that will use or engage the spawn.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yup, this one is true, though Ive seen tons of disputes about it. Part of it, in my opinion, is game design, I know when I was camping some pieces for my VP key, namely some ground spawns, I could not bear to sit and wait for something to just appear on the ground.  Ask Ketel sometime what a royal pain this is if you know him.  Sooo, I would park my cleric there, and play an alt character.  If someone were to pick up my &quot;spawn&quot; while I was gone, its my own fault. Not being there with the character that you are using before, and up to the point where your &quot;mob&quot; spawns, is only setting yourself up for frustration. Patience pays.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  you answer camp checks within a timely maner to your right to the spawn.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Im going to continue to play devils advocate here. There are so many exceptions to this rule and loopholes that I for one, couldnt consider it legit. If someone is sitting at a spawn and perhaps 1.) in battle spam 2.) briefly afk 3.) has the person asking on ignore...the list goes on, you get my point; a camp check isnt typically a reliable way to check a spawn. Going to the actual place where the mob or item spawns and seeing if anyone else is there will tell you.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   you get trained on and have to zone. in this case, you should, depending on the zone and mob, be giving propor ammount of time to get back to your original position.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So..what happened if someone repeatedly trains you. What defines &quot;proper&quot; time? What happens if it spawns while you are away? Do you have a right to be upset, or rather, just write it off as bad luck.<br>
<br>
The thing is, your rules work for &quot;most people&quot; but they are community rules. They are unwritten and unenforced.  All it takes is one person to break these so called &quot;rules&quot; and more will follow. They are plenty of people who will respect someone being visibly at a spawn, plenty of people that will respect a &quot;camp check&quot;, but the thing is, no one has to.<br>
<br>
Its kinda an innocent belief. Granted, it would be nice if we were all civil, polite, courteous, and respectful. You can deny that the people who arent like this exist, but you will only set yourself up for disappointment and stress. My personal theory, be on your toes, you never know when that one person who doesnt follow our &quot;common courtesy rules&quot; will stroll up. If they beat me to a spawn, no amount of whining, ranting, or tells is going to get it back. I guess at times like those, you can just be happy and proud that you would never do something like that, and take satisfaction that you uphold some sort of moral standard, even in this surreal world.<br>
<br>
Part of the &quot;Rush&quot; and fun of this game that we rarely acknowledege on a daily basis is that &quot;Race&quot; to a spawn, that bit of anxiousness when its about time for it to pop. Wondering if someone else may come along, wondering if your going to go LD and lose it, wondering if you might be afk when the thing you have been waiting for finally spawns.  Frustrating if you lose, joyful if you &quot;win&quot;. If we were constanly &quot;rewarded&quot; without any &quot;risk&quot; this game wouldnt be much fun.<br>

<br>
1) If you aren't going to respect someone calling a spawn such as Ragefire when they don't have enough people and your group is ready to go, don't expect others to wait for you while you recruit help.<br>
<br>
2) If you get trained out and would like your spawn back, don't take someone else's spawn if they get trained out.<br>
<br>
3) If you are going to enforce the Play Nice Policy, don't get upset if someone enforces it on you.<br>
<br>
Too many cry babies in this game lately.  I have changed my attitude, and I'm not going to cry or petition everytime something doesn't go my way in the game when it comes to camp, but I will treat people with the same respect you treat me.  If you are in Disco 1 and my group in Disco 2 and you start pulling from my area, then be prepared for me to pull from yours.  If you run into Fear while my guild is hunting there and start pulling mobs without trying to share the zone in some way, then don't expect me to do the same when you are up there first next time.  This is not a threat, and I am not a mean person, but I am tired people envoking the Play Nice Policy when it suits them, then crying about it when it's used against them.  I don't get along with everyone in this game, but I will respect the people I detest the most as long as they show me at least the same respect back.<br>

If you can't hold the spawn, leave, or fail in your attempt, you no longer have rights to it, and the next person/group waiting gets their shot.  This is the guidelines (if memory serves), but if the peeps can't work it out to share (citing the crowded days of lower guk where each potential frenzy spawn was camped by a different group) then it's up to the whim of an arbitrating GM (which are not consistent in their interpretation of PnP -no surprise).  I have a story where a GM gave the right to some druid hunting the AC in South Ro over our little hunting party after contesting our presence doing the same thing.  It was questionable who was there first as I showed up to help a guildmate hunt the one-eye late in the venture.  The GM settled that question by having each respective party roll (we thought we had it as we rolled higher), but the GM said who ever rolled closer to some number he rolled after the bones were already tossed.  The druid won the spawn, which is amusing in itself as he would have really had to keep at it with every hunter coming into the zone.  Needless to say we moved on to hunt elsewhere.  It would be interesting to try and apply the arbitration of the above example to hunting golems on the Plane of Fear, or the mini-bosses in Hate.  Does my clustering cadre of heroes in the safe camp clearing our way through constitue holding the spawn?  Implying my presence gives my hunting party first crack.  Then there is always the factor of getting attacked by the mob before someone actually hunting it has a chance to aggro it, I've often heard for KS concerns that if you aggro'ed the mob first then GM's will favor your right to the mob.  As for answering camp checks, that's a courtesy, but should never be expected.  Shouting out to the zone periodically has been said to lend creedence to one's claim when contesting a spawn. But, we've all been in the position too often fighting and missing that periodic camp check in the battle spam.  I've always felt that if you didn't respond to my camp check, and my group has started in, then we are going to share it, I'll move on, or let the god's decide our contention. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/23/01 7:18:17 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What gives your right to a spawn?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> As far as I know, the only thing that really matters is if you are &quot;the first one to engage the mob with an adequate force to kill it&quot;.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

The second half is subjective, easily contested if you attack a mob that is already engaged, and too easy to end up looking like an ass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/usalubre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Salubre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://sachem.freewebspace.com/images/cross2.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(7/23/01 10:25:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What gives your right to a spawn?</span><hr size=1> I think you all need to take a hit off my freakin peace pipe and get off the stupid verant ass rules <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
sooo many players are whiners... <br>
<br>
booo wooo he took that mob I was &quot;planning&quot; on taking... <br>
<br>
The following are oogobuk's rules...<br>
=================================<br>
<br>
Rule #1:  You Snooze, You Lose.<br>
<br>
Rule #2:  You KS (true KS'ing not that bed wetting whining you call KS'ing)  you get reported / petitioned and GMS well make you share next time and give you a warning<br>
<br>
Rule #3: Only set (non-uber) spawns within closed rooms deep in dungeons can be considered camps  Anything outdoors WW dragons, WL sent suits, TT anything, SK, NK, and yes even SoRo AC.. are all OPEN camps.. anyone that pulls (first engages) has SOLE right to what ever they touch.  GM's have ALWAYS said you must share in these area's without exception.  So next time you clam (hunters cycle) Dont be surprised when someone like ME kills that named that you were to slow to get to, or that hunter etc.. you petition me, the GM will tell you that you MUST share !  end of story!<br>
<br>
Rule #4: All loot is crap !  even that dragon and god loot... IF YOU ARE NOT having FUN !<br>
<br>
Rule #5: if you evac or do a quick CR to the zone and back to your camp (lets say less than 20 mins) you should get your camp back.. or at the least SHARE IT until the other group gets pissed and leaves !<br>
<br>
Rule #6: if you take a very long time doing a CR (lets say an hour) another group takes your spawn.. your just SOL...<br>
<br>
Rule #7: If Someone beets me to a spawn / camp.. I congrads them and move on... and I expect the same in return<br>
<br>
Rule #8: if you are STUPID enough to pull the red dragon in SF to the zone RIGHT through me while I'm quad kiting... you can not only have your dragon but my 4+ mobs too.. but dont cry to my guild leader saying I trained you.. because he will just laugh at you in guild chat and call you an idoit. !    And dont think that just because you /shout pulling dragon to the zone, means I'm going to drop what I'm doing  just expect several adds with your dragon..   Just learn how to kill him in the chasam like everyone else.. <br>
<br>
Rule #9: If you are level 10000000 you have no busniess in PAW KS'ing 10th level people just so you can get fur's.. go somewhere else... <br>
<br>
Rule #10:  No whining<br>
<br>
Rule #11: Be nice to everyone.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  flowers, little bunnies, butreflys, happy thoughts.. and   OOGOBUK your WORSE nitemare.. !<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
honestly I'm a nicer guy than my posts make me out to be.. <p><img src="http://freepages.ugo.com/Vis/files/SIG.jpg">

Ex. My guild and another rolls into Neriak to take out the mob for the chanter epic. Lo and behold there is a person there claiming it for herself, one problem, the person claiming it was level 1. Not exactly high enough to take it, we gave her time to rally up her friends and switch over to her main to take it. No one showed up, so we pulled it and killed it. Well of course she complained. So it's my opinion that you got to be there and able to take it. <p><font size="4" color="#0000FF" face="Monotype Corsiva"><b>Marron Starfyre<br>
