  Wow I am in shock at some of the replies here.<br>
<br>
  Tried writing this about 6 times now without it sounding like Im flaming someone... <br>
<br>
  I still do not understand how a guild can not see that disciplining their own members is one of the most long term beneficial things they can do..... also one of the hardest though I guess.<br>
<br>
This in no way has nothing to do with anyone or any guild ... just shocked at some of the replies.  <p><BR>

Period.  The end.  It's human nature and can't be avoided.  Has nothing to do with stereotyping. <br>
<br>
If you keep company with KS'in jackasses, then that's how you'll be known.  <br>
<br>
If that sits well with you, then keep your &quot;important friendships&quot; and just deal with the fact that you are gonna be lumped into that same category.<br>
<br>
If not, exercise your right to leave or lean on your leadership to insist KS'in_jackass_01 is removed from your guild.<br>
<br>
If you choose to turn a blind eye, you are in effect, condoning the actions as acceptable.  <br>
<br>
Of course, you could be like SOME who defend and offer lame excuses for KS'in_jackass_01's actions, which isn't guilt by association, it's worse.  <br>
<br>
When coming from KS'in_jackass_01's guild leader, it condemns the rest of the tag to the same fate, simply because their leader speaks for them.   <br>

Fkin, who said they saw manteca run into thier camp, specifically?  It wasn't stated by Lalian to me, nor in the thread....  It was asked a few times where was their camp, but got no replies.  I know they got hit twice by Sev, I know Manteca died 6 times pulling him for the MB team....  that adds up to a high probablility he died and sev aggrod them.  Really, where there camp was and where sev was being pulled to can lend a big clue as to the likelyhood of it being intentional or not.  Being that figuring out how that happened is NOT what anyone wants, but just to flame... probably won't happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
And you fail to realize it takes more than 1 MB wizard to slay that dragon.  If the other 4 or 5 MB wizards were completely unaware of what was going on, how can you be sure Jama was aware he was training?  He died 6 times pulling, and sev hit the DB camp (wherever it may have been)  twice.   Jama *intentionally* trains them for sure, but Azkirte, Karraway, ect ect... are 100% clueless that anything is goin on in the zone?  This is believable to you?  That makes no rational sense.  I don't find azkirte or karraway to be particularly stupid, so I have a hard time believing things as you seem to think they happened.  The other MB wizards would have to be complete morons to not have a clue what was going on. <br>
<br>
<br>
Fkin... to you the flame boards= the game.  To most folks it does not.  Jama has never posted here he doesn't have a reason to.  Talk to him in game, he's talked to me and pala in game, at the very least.<br>
<br>
<br>
Why is talking things over anathema to so many ppl?  <br>
<br>
<br>
I see so many guilds, from top-end uber to breaking kunark mobs,  that have ppl that jump on and flame full force at every opportunity... then when their crew/teammate does the same thing... flame full force at every opportunity the ppl that come here to call them on it, because when THEY did it it was justified.   It's ridiculous.<br>
<br>
<br>
Wraith has fucked up a few times, no doubt.  Salta likes bringing up moncleared... Moncleared fucked up, knows it, owned up to it and if it helps hearing it in print if it becomes a repeat performance it will affect guildtags.   I'd like to see one other guild that has members that own up to their shit, or have the confidence in thier team and teammates to discipline them without booting them outright for a first offence.  Anyone?<br>
<br>
<br>
The case against jama is so full of holes its ridiculous.  If you call the MB team on it, for going ahead with DB there... you got a strong case.  Jama the evil overlord who manipulated other wizzies into not seeing DB in the same zone being trained and cleverly tricked pala into an agreement pala thought was just a joke yet with the mb team there and ready felt the need to train anyway just because, and did so without his MB teammates noticing.... seems farfetched.   <br>

EQ is a game.  When you join a guild and stay in the guild its by your own choice.  You have other places you can go other things you can do or you can quit and go to a different game.<br>
<br>
School, Congress, Work, Random hold ups at your local gas station where you stopped to get some gas by someone you went to school with, arent things you can just put down and go somewhere else if others there do things that are shitty except to a very limited extent.<br>
<br>
Now you can still use those examples anyway for the broader point of this thread.  If im in a business and I find out tis laundering money and other random illegal acts you bet im going to quit and go to the police.  Why?  Cause when it is found out I dont want to be arrested and considered part of the acts.  As i WOULD be.  Why does it seem all politicians considered liars and schemers?  Cause some are.  So what happens?  Guild by association.  The vast majority of the populace considers them all that way.  Why?  Cause they dont know them as persons and have no way of knowing which are which.  Guilt by association once more.  How about a schools sports team?  If your team steals the opponents teams playbook and uses that to win, are you going to hang around still?  I wouldnt.  If it ever becomes known youre going to get tagged along with everyone else in the team.  Staying says you accept and condone that as acceptable.  Once again, Guild by Association.<br>
<br>
Now if its ONE person in these examples the business wwould sure as hell fire the person as soon as they found out.  The politician is going to lose most of their credibility and eventually fade out of the populaces eye.  And the one cheater on the school sports team is gonna get the boot.<br>
<br>
If youre there with the gunman when he holds the 7-11 up are you going to be considered associated with them because you had gone to school with them?  not likely.  If the gunman is your best friend and youre with them almost every day are the police going ot investigate you?  Sure as hell they are.<br>
<br>
As to them being your friends, well I dont know abotu anyone else but I personally wouldnt want ot be friends with someone who is a complete jackass and griefs other people.  If one of my friends decided to become a bank robber or someone who held up 7-11's I would tell them they better stop or they can go find someone else to be their friend.  Im loyal to my friends.  I care a lot for my friends.  Someone who fucks over other people for their own gain or just to do it is NOT my friend. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143487">

Can't get much more fucked up than that.<br>
<br>
How about, if you want me to treat you with respect and kindness, treat others the same because if you fall short of common courtesy when dealing with others, I am not blind to the possibility that one day I may be the one you screw over.<br>
<br>
Edit: I don't know. I don't profess to be an angel. I have trained/killed people on accident and tried to make it right. BTW, there is a steep difference between screwing up and screwing someone over. I don't know how holding someone to--generally--agreed upon expectations of right and wrong is asking for too much. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A> at: 8/5/02 4:44:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 390<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/5/02 4:40:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=455.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guilt by assocation</span><hr size=1> &quot;IMO casting the Guilt by Association is not the right way.

You shouldn't judge a guild by its member(s) until an overwhelming number of members shed a bad, good, or neutral impression through their actions. But (there had to be a but) it's very hard to NOT form an opinion of a guild based on singular bad/good/neutral deeds by its members. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uesmalyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Esmalyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Bitch Queen</span><br>  Posts: 391<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/5/02 4:47:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=455.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Guilt by assocation</span><hr size=1> &quot;What a missunderstanding...&quot;<br>

If the people involved were found to have done the crime.. then boot them but witch hunts are bad.<br>
