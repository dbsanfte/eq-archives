Interlude<br>
Authors:  Esmalyn (pseudonym)    Millikin Erreene (pseudonymn)<br>
<br>
After shaking the strange feeling from her hands after her latest attempt at spellcasting, Millikin strolled over to the amphitheater for duels in the Bazaar.  She had seen a certain rogue lurking in the crowds earlier, likely picking through the pockets of the unwary.  Whistling to herself, her hand closed around a note she kept folded up in her pocket that reminded her of why she was seeking out Esmalyn now that her other preparations were underway.<br>
<br>
Cheers erupted to signal the end of a match as several runners moved out with a stretcher to remove the troll warrior lying on the ground, an arrow imbedded in his side.  Roses were thrown to the feet of the victor as he bowed gallantly on his way out to make room for the next combatants.  The ranger caught sight of her quarry, currently dawdling up the stands, her cloak whispering over the marble. Once the Tier'Dal decided on a seat, Millikin casually walked up whistling.  Esmalyn's keen hearing discerned the notes of the tune and while she didn't know it by name, she knew the ranger who was fond of whistling it from time to time.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vendui, elg' hasek,&quot; the Tier'Dal rogue sighed at her approach.  &quot;Lu'oh phuul dos?&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm doing well.  And yourself?&quot;  Millikin continued whistling, knowing perfectly well Esmalyn did not really care how she was, but she went along with the minor civilities for the time being.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was well.&quot;  Esmalyn finally bothered to look over at the Feir`Dal, red eyes flickering.  &quot;Why have you come here?  You reek of marsh and grass.&quot;<br>
<br>
Millikin took a deep breath.  Finally the formalities have dispensed, down to business.<br>
<br>
&quot;Actually it's pine, not like you would be able to recognize the scent, but to cut to the chase, I need something from you.  You know of the Shissar, I presume?  At least of their existence, general appearance, and capabilities.<br>
<br>
Esmalyn reached up and pushed back her hood. Shoulder-length, white hair spilled out. &quot;They worm around The Grey, that airless plain.&quot;  She paused for a moment.  &quot;You are desperate.&quot; <br>
<br>
The sound of cymbals announced the start of a new match and Millikin turned to regard the latest combatants.  Two wizards were currently in the process of summoning energies to launch their attack.  Formal bets were called and coins changed hands.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not hardly,&quot; Millikin replied.  &quot;Simply asking you is what's most convenient at this time.&quot;  She did not turn to face the rogue until after the first wave of flaming rain descended upon one of the wizards scorching the ground but leaving him relatively unscathed.  &quot;I need a fast acting and fatal poison capable of killing a Shissar introduced by arrow or sword edge.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;This is new territory.  How much is this poison worth to you?&quot;  Esmalyn turned her attention back to the wizards' duel.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have components already to work with,&quot; Millikin replied. <br>
<br>
&quot;Is this a trap you have in store for me, payback for breaking into your flat?&quot; Esmalyn asked, sliding her gaze over to the Feir`Dal once more.<br>
<br>
&quot;No.  But since you brought that up...&quot; Millikin paused momentarily before continuing.  Though the ranger still continued her association on occasion with the rogue, Millikin had not forgotten (or forgiven) the incident where the dark elf thief had sneaked into her room and stolen a medallion piece from her.  The ranger simply bided her time, knowing eventually one day Esmalyn would be rewarded in full measure for her deceit.  As far as the enchanter who had hired Esmalyn for the task, Millikin considered that her role was rewarded as deserved at the hands of the ranger.<br>
<br>
&quot;... I would be willing to forget about your role in it if you can manage to make this poison.  The Luhtmauyar D`Varr was not so fortunate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The Luhtmauyar D`Varr should not let her self-worth impair her judgment.  You have not worked up the nerve to strike back at me.  Tell me, lorulm darthirii, how has this changed?&quot;  Despite her words of bravado, the Teir`Dal rogue went taut as she looked up in appraisal of the ranger.<br>
<br>
&quot;I could strike back at this very instance.  Or tomorrow.  Or next week.  I have the time,&quot; Millikin replied evenly.  <br>
<br>
&quot;I'll keep that in mind.&quot;  Esmalyn returned her attention to the fight.  Her facial expression schooled to neutrality as she relaxed somewhat.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I'm aware that you were simply one of Valdayana's flunkies, carrying out her orders.&quot;  Millikin took a tone of feigned innocent understanding.  &quot;Faced with the prospect of getting paid or risking her ire, most people of your caliber would take the money too.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;One of us is gaining notoriety as a lackey, lorulm darthirii, and I don't intend to travel down that path.&quot;  Esmalyn turned once again to look over at the ranger, the scar over her eye accentuating the sneer twisting her lips as she responded.  &quot;Either pay a wage or seek another pathetic rogue to do your bidding free of charge.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Are you even capable of making such a poison?  Aside from the fact that you do little more than steal from those you work with, I'm wondering if you are up to the task.  You can't even pilfer from a fungusbeast without getting caught.&quot;  Millikin couldn't resist adding the last statement for emphasis.  She could tell by Esmalyn's sudden vagueness that the comment struck a chord.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am versed in amounts, combinations; plants and fungi.  Injected, swallowed, or applied.  I could --&quot;  She paused, a bemused grin on her face.  &quot;You couldn't even keep a common thief from ransacking your home.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You didn't ransack 'my' home.&quot;  Millikin replied dryly.  The ranger did not consider the rented room in Shadowhaven her home by any stretch nor was she going to allow the rogue to think any jab she took to provoke her would have any effect or distract from the business at hand.  Either she could make the poison or she could not.  She had little time to continue this game of point-counterpoint.  &quot;Nor did you answer the question.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't interrupt me.&quot;  Esmalyn leaned back and looked up at Millikin.  &quot;I am capable of such a poison, although, I can't offer a set time.  A week at the most.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;A week at most to make it?&quot;  Millikin inquired.  Esmalyn nodded.  Millikin was not satisfied.  &quot;Five or seven days in Norrathian time?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Seven days in a Norrathian week, unless you've attuned yourself to Luclin's cycles beyond repair.&quot;  Esmalyn idly wondered if Millikin was representative of her race in overall stupidity.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm making sure the time frame is clear as water.&quot;  Millikin remarked, she was not going to be conned about Luclin versus Norrath time frames due to the lack of standard recognizable cycles of day and night on Norrath's moon.  &quot;How much?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fifty platinum.  I know how thrifty you are.  Don't ask how, and doubt you carry more than ten gold on your person right now.&quot;  Esmalyn didn't miss a beat where money was concerned.  She pointed behind the ranger in the direction of the bank.  &quot;Half up front, the other half at production.  We can make a transfer at the bank now if you wish.&quot;  The rogue stood up to leave.<br>
<br>
&quot;What guarantee do I have it will work?&quot;  Millikin narrowed her eyes.  &quot;I don't particularly care for the prospect of paying fifty platinum for colored water.&quot;<br>
<br>
Esmalyn smirked and she canted her head to the side in response.  &quot;Presuming your samples are relatively fresh and I have enough to spare for a test, you can witness it in action yourself. You can even volunteer to have it tested on yourself, which, I wouldn't protest.&quot;  She walked past the ranger, quite confident in her position regarding this transaction.<br>
<br>
The ranger did not think the suggestion of a simple poison test was enough.  &quot;I need it to kill Shissar, not some rat you picked up in the sewers you roam.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;We can test it on a Shissar.  I don't promise more than I can deliver.  Valdayana could tell you that.&quot;  Esmalyn replied over her shoulder.<br>
<br>
&quot;A moment...&quot;  Millikin paused then continued.  &quot;One third now.  The remaining two-thirds after the test sample proves worthwhile.  And you make it in three days... for sixty-five platinum.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Seventy platinum.&quot;  Esmalyn stopped and shifted her weight to turn midstep.  &quot;Materials, an alchemist if I need to hire one, trips to and from the Grey.&quot;  She ticked these off on her fingers.  &quot;Seventy platinum.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It doesn't cost anything to reach the Grey.  And I'm supplying the materials already.&quot;  Millikin argued.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are rushing me.  I cannot account for accidents, however that may please you, or shortages from quick samples.  Seventy platinum for three days or fifty for seven.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Could you manage an accident after the test?  It would save me about forty-six platinum.&quot;  The ranger doesn't even bother to hide her grin.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dark powers help me, I can think of the perfect accident.&quot;  Esmalyn's poignant gaze fell upon the ranger.<br>
<br>
&quot;So long as its painful for you, I am not overly concerned about perfection,&quot; Millikin replied dryly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Its settled then.  Meet me at the bank and make ready thirty-five platinum.&quot;  Esmalyn turned on a booted heel and left the stadium, quickly disappearing from sight as Millikin headed towards the bank muttering about avaricious money-grubbing Teir`Dal.<br>

<br>
     Millikin handed the four orbs over to Sontalak.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I found them all.&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &quot;So you did.&quot;  The ancient dragon answered response as he inspected each orb for flaws.  &quot;And you did not damage any of them either.&quot;  The dragon folded his wings slightly as he placed the four orbs into on of his clawed hands.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Is the fact that each one represents a different elemental force significant?&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes.  As I told you before, they contain an elemental force's essence to imbue into another person, Wood elf.  Now stand aside unless you wish to become charred.&quot;  The rust colored dragon flicked his tail once for emphasis and Millikin stepped back as Sontalak drew a deep intake of breath and then quickly expelled a blast of lava into his hand holding the orbs and quickly closed it around them.  Millikin watched as a pale orange nimbus surrounded the dragon's claws.  <br>
<br>
In moments Sontalak opened his hand to reveal a small flat crystalline disc bearing claw marks on the edges and the etchings of a fire dragon, wind dragon, water dragon, and an earth dragon on either side.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;Simply break it to release its power into yourself.&quot;  Sontalak handed the disc to Millikin.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Thank you.  But I was not going to use it myself.&quot;  Millikin replied as she took the offered disc.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Then why have you spent the past few weeks pestering me about the orb you found a while ago and wheedling under rocks and ash through the mountains of Skyfire for the others more recently?&quot;  Sontalak craned his neck to face the ranger, bringing himself eye level to her, his look of consternation caused the ranger to freeze in place.<br>
<br>
  &quot;It's for another.&quot;  Millikin stated uneasily when the dragon fear dissipated and she could think coherently enough to reply.  &quot;She's spent time going through books and scrolls in the Skyshrine and knows much of the Ring of Scale also.&quot;   Sontalak snorted at the mention of the Ring of Scale, an outcast sect of the Claws of Veeshan.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;I thought she might like something akin to this.&quot;  Millikin paused.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Then perhaps your friend should do the work to acquire it.&quot;  Sontalak rumbled once again.  The mental image brought a grin to Millikin's face though it quickly vanished.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I doubt she would lower herself to foraging, even if she could.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;Then why should she reap the benefits of your efforts, Ranger?&quot;<br>
<br>
     Millikin paused to consider that question.  Indeed why was she even wasting her time?  Chances are the gift would be spurned outright.  Or worse, viewed as a bribe.  She quickly pushed aside that line of thought by deciding she would simply steel herself for the likely insults and deal with them when the time came.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I suppose it is a means of requiting how I benefited from her efforts.&quot;   Millikin replied after a thoughtful pause.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I see.&quot;  Sontalak replied.<br>
<br>
  &quot;I'm not exactly adept with expressing my feelings.&quot;   The ranger explained.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Actions speak for themselves, Ranger.&quot;  Sontalak remarked as he looked out into the wasteland ahead of them.  &quot;Are you going to continue with stories of your exploits with your shaman friend on the moon or do I wait until next time?&quot;  Another time she would recount to the aged dragon of her most recent sojourn into the Sshraeshza temple but for now, Millikin beamed as she began to recount to the dragon one of her and Saldaria's earlier forays into the Grey battling the Shissar and golems just outside the temple.<br>

<br>
<br>
     Millikin tended to take into consideration any personality criticisms made about her, even if she did not acknowledge them initially.  After some objective consideration of her behavior (if one taking into consideration their own traits can really be considered objective) and inquiries from those she did openly respect, the general consensus was that her somewhat somber outlook could be construed as such by those not familiar with the ranger's true nature.<br>
<br>
     Why did she care what the luhtmauyar thought of her?  Thinking rationally, the ranger knew perfectly well that Valdayana D`Varr held no regard for anyone but herself so why should her opinion of anyone (which is guaranteed to be low) matter.  Millikin herself wasn't sure if she held some small hope that the enchanter was not irredeemably evil.  She remembered Ashwith's warning that she could just as likely help someone out for the sheer feeling of power over them and not because she held a modicum of regard for them.  Though the warning made sense, the concept was foreign to Millikin.  Whenever she traveled or explored with others, she felt a sense of responsibility for their safety and took what means she could to ensure that they did survive.  How anyone could not share that sense of obligation was inconceivable to the ranger.  Was that not the entire purpose of working together?<br>
<br>
     Maybe Millikin respected the enchanter beyond the comprehension that she was extremely skilled in her field in spite of the enchanter's disparaging comments about her race, competence as a ranger, or personality.  Though how or why she had no clue.  Millikin hid the fact that sometimes Valdayana's comments bothered her by simply ignoring them or replying with a half-felt rejoinder of her own.  They technically shouldn't bother her because they were either said to simply provoke her or validly point out a fault.  And maybe the latter fact was what Millikin respected about her.  She didn't know for sure.<br>
<br>
     Millikin stared down at the crystalline disc lying on the table.  It took quite a bit of effort on her part to obtain the crystals to make it, and convince the dragon known as Sontalak to do so as well.  The ranger was not sure how she would react to the insulting rebuff that was likely to result from her offering it to the enchanter and the thought of simply sending it by courier was very appealing.  At least she wouldn't see the rejection firsthand.  The thought of the gift becoming impersonal though made her ultimately dismiss the idea of having it delivered.  Millikin decided to offer it firsthand and simply brace herself for the worst as she picked up the disc and slid it into her pocket as she headed out of her flat. <p>M.

The enchanter casually strolled along the decks of the Sky Hawk, a two masted schooner heading towards Freeport.  Desiring to keep her whereabouts and current activities obscured, she opted to travel under the guise of a half elven spice merchant named Raven Yadan.  The disguise not only prevented her from being beleaguered or attacked by the elves and dwarves who live on the continent, but it also served to mislead any potential rivals or enemies from ascertaining the reasons for her presence.  Forever pursuing knowledge, no matter how recondite or obscure, the enchanter's business in Faedwyr was recently concluded with the acquisition of a journal of some long forgotten thaumathurgy practices.<br>
<br>
As the Sky Hawk went underway, the enchanter noticed a wood elf standing near the ship's railing, readying a corded arrow into the short bow she held as she looked down at the waters.  <br>
<br>
  'Trust a wood elf to find a way to complicate something as simple-minded as fishing.'  The half elf watched as she fired the arrow into the water.  As it streaked downward, the cord unfurled to reveal it was tied to the railing and soon the ranger started to pull the cord up and reveal her catch.  A codfish was impaled upon the arrow.<br>
<br>
  &quot;You know, fishing is infinitely easier if you use a fishing pole and bait.&quot;  The half elf remarked as the ranger extracted her arrow and tossed her catch into a nearby basket.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Yes, but I don't have either with me right now.  And this is an alternative.&quot;  The wood elf turned to the speaker and instantly the incognito enchanter recognized her.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Ranger.&quot;  The half elf spoke half question, half statement.  The Feir` Dal nodded in affirmation and turned to get a better look at the individual.  The silver haired half elf was nearly six feet tall, steel grey eyes were hidden behind a pair of gold wire-rimmed spectacles.  And despite the fact that she was dressed in a silk wayfarer's chemise and loose fitting trousers, her mannerisms seemed to indicate to the ranger that the half elf was less at home aboard a ship than a mansion in some large city.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Millikin Erreene.&quot;  The ranger set aside her bow and extended her hand in greeting.  For her own part, the half elf adjusted the spectacles she was wearing and glanced at the offered hand with a measured pause before taking the hand in greeting -- just long enough to be polite.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Raven Yadan.&quot;  She responded, smiling faintly to the ranger, wiping her hand on a handkerchief she had removed from a pocket.  <br>
<br>
  &quot;A pleasure.&quot;  Millikin turned to pick up her bow, hiding a faint smile at the display of snobbery.  &quot;Did you lose your book or something?&quot;  She readied another arrow.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Excuse me?&quot;  Raven asked in a quizzical tone.  'How could she know about the journal?'  Instantly she studied Millikin in mild suspicion, masked as curiosity.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The reading spectacles.&quot;   The ranger indicated with a slight gesture.  Something caught Raven's attention as Millikin turned back to the water.  The medicine pouch worn around the ranger's neck possessed an eldritch power that called to the enchanter.  This was not one of the myriad druidic talismans rangers and others of her ilk typically carried.<br>
<br>
  &quot;The spectacles.  No.&quot;  Raven responded.  &quot;They simply help me to see better.  What is that you're wearing around your neck?  I've never seen that before.&quot;<br>
<br>
  &quot;It's a medicine pouch.  It's used to hold spell components and similar objects.&quot;  Millikin replied, studying the water.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Is that what yours possesses?&quot;  Raven's question seemed innocuous enough, but something about it gave Millikin pause.  'Why would it suddenly be of interest to someone who barely deigned to shake hands earlier?'<br>
<br>
  &quot;No.  It carries an object I intend to give to someone else.&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &quot;What sort of object?&quot;  <br>
<br>
  &quot;Something I obtained a while ago.&quot;  Millikin fired another arrow, this time intentionally missing her target.  No other information was forthcoming.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Better luck next time, I suppose.&quot;  Raven remarked, smiling faintly to her once again.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Perhaps.&quot;  Millikin retrieved the arrow then tucked the pouch underneath her tunic before resuming her bow fishing.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Good day to you then, Millikin Erreene.&quot;  Raven turned to leave, knowing she may have better luck with the ranger at a later time.<br>
<br>
  &quot;Good afternoon, Ms. Yadan.&quot;  Millikin replied, watching the half elf depart from the corner of her eye.  'Why did she have the feeling she knew her from somewhere?'<br>

<br>
Shiobahn Fyrestrike (formerly Goldbrooke) sat quietly upon a small blanket by the lakeside in her home town.  Above her loomed the guilds of the magical arts, her own designation included amongst them, and every so often she could hear the workings of different defensive spells coming from above.  Her momentary solitude was dedicated to toying with a pouch of runes, identifying each of the marks upon them to further her research for greater spells.  Quasqueton had promised her even greater runes when he returned back from his quest, but the days seemed to grow longer and longer in his absence.  It was in this moment of study and reflection that she distinctly heard the soft footfalls of the sure-footed ranger approaching her.<br>
<br>
A smile crept across the delicately defined high Elven face as she let the initial shock of the visit wear away, and Shio rose to her feet.  She stood taller than the ranger, though her frame more willowy, and her hair was quite obviously flame kissed by her deity of the arts, Solusek Ro, whom she called upon for the power of her spells.  She reached out her hands to the ranger as she spoke softly in the language of the elves "Creoso eska, tinu en'Tunare.  It is good to see you home cousin."  Millikin gripped her hands in return though her present mood was unreadable, as often it was, by her kin.  "Diol'lle, Shiobahn.  It is good to return once again."<br>
<br>
Shiobahn studied her a moment, certain there was a tale to be told, but not knowing when the ranger would tell it, if she decided to speak of it at all.  "We shall catch up over a glass of Elven wine.  The day is still early and the tavern is open across town.  Just allow me to pack my things."  Shio did not offer much room for argument, though then she rarely did.  She quickly bent down to retrieve her runes, pouring them back into a small pouch that hung from her belt.  She carried a small myriad of trinkets this way, including a finely crafted golden bowl bearing a few small dings in the bottom which hinted at the fact she was not afraid to swing it at something if one of her spells was going awry, no matter how futile the attempt was.  Tucking her blanket into a backpack she then set off on foot along side her cousin to the tavern.<br>
<br>
........................<br>
Felwith - Northern District<br>
<br>
A glass of Elven wine and a treat of a small fruit tart later the two sat together in an out of the way corner of the bar.  It was an enjoyable time filled with tales of adventure, many of Millikin's taking place in the frozen lands of Velious which intrigued Shio and much of Shio's having taken place another great distance away, in the newly explored moon of Luclin.  It was Millikin's comments of the wastelands in the far west reaches of the frozen continent that perked Shio's attention.  "Cousin, why have you come home from such great adventures?  And have you heard word of a Quasqueton?  He has been in those far reaching lands for some time up to now under quest of the Coldain.  I know he is allied to the dragon beasts that survive out there, but he has not sent word recently and I worry.  The last I knew he had enlisted the aid of the Troubadour Autumnwyld, but it is still a harsh land for wizard and bard alone."<br>
<br>
She quickly saw the look of recognition in Millikin's eyes as she uttered the names, and a look of hope appeared upon her face.  She felt the matter bore further explanation and she quickly added in "Quas and I were bound together just this spring in a quiet ceremony under Ro's watchful eye.  It is a difficult balance some days, love and magic.  We did not make a spectacle of our union, I am sorry to have not informed you but it is nearly impossible to track the tracker." <br>

Had she heard of Quasqueton? Of course she had. Her thoughts momentarily turned to her initial meeting with him. Autumn had invited her to venture into Charasis, the Howling Stones with some of her recent adventuring companions. The purpose of the foray into the tomb of the late Drusilla Sathir was for archaeological reasons: Quasqueton wished to complete a set of Kylong armor and had spent considerable time gathering up the different pieces of armor once worn by the Iksar tribe.<br>
<br>
He had seemed a bit unconventional, to say the least. Instead of wielding magic with the calculating efficiency of Valdayana D`Varr or passionate devotion of Saldaria Snowspirit, Quasqueton blithely hurled lightning or fire at the walking dead or golem sentries that protected the place as if he were playing a game of catch. Eventually they obtained the final piece of armor for his collection, a chainmail tunic. Millikin had been surprised that the enchantment placed on by its iksar creators granting the wearer enhanced strength had remained in tact despite the onslaught of magic and melee required to destroy the iksar skeletal remains that had been wearing it.<br>
<br>
She had met him subsequently a few more times, once in the Umbral Plains, but more commonly in Velious. During a Coldain assault on the Ry`Gorr fort, a gem mining expedition in the Siren's Grotto, and once while exploring the Dragon Necropolis. Millikin snapped out of her mental reverie as Shiobahn explained that they had been married recently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I do know him. I've met him and adventured with him, the last time was while in Velious.&quot; Millikin rubbed the back of her neck, idly wondering how such a detail could have been forgotten to have been mentioned by her parents or her sister in their correspondence. Then it occurred to her that even they may not know. Acting on spontaneous impulse was a common trait, particularly in the Goldbrooke family and Millikin could not honestly say she always acted only after careful deliberation.<br>
<br>
Nor could she exactly sum up her feelings on hearing the news except that she somehow expected it to come back and haunt her. Somehow. Millikin reached for the black medicine pouch she was wearing around her neck to make sure it was still there as she downed the last of her wine then took a deep breath, hoping her offer wouldn't turn out to be more than she bargained for.<br>
<br>
&quot;It appears my list of errands for arcanists is expanding. Did you have a message you wanted me to deliver to him?&quot; <br>
