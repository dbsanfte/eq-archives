<br>
To whit: MB makes it harder for people to get epics.<br>
<br>
MB makes it much easier to get epics and increases the number of epics that come into the world.<br>
<br>
Before it was pretty much necessary to be in a certain type of guild to get an epic.<br>
<br>
A not too small guild but not too advanced guild. (hence Montyy's troubles)<br>
<br>
And it was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> necessary</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to join one of these guilds. Really there was no option.<br>
<br>
Now anyone can get their epic drops. Just camp the mob and get your guild when it pops, if you can, or get burners if you can't.<br>
<br>
And the epic drops that ARE sold now are much cheaper than they were before.<br>
<br>
If you want the mob you camp the mob.<br>
<br>
How is this bad?<br>
<br>
So tell me.. who is really suffering?<br>
<br>
The warrior/bard/pally that enlists the aid of 5 burners rather than 25 other people? Seems like more participation to me being 1 of 6 rather than one of 26. And what if it pops when its the middle of the night for most people in his guild? Well he was just screwed before. Now he's still got a shot.<br>
<br>
Excitement? Try pulling a dragon for a burn team if you want excitement.<br>
<br>
Challenge? Burns have a good shot of success but they can and do fail sometimes.<br>
<br>
The truth is that more people are getting their epics now than ever before. The epic pieces that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sold are sold for cheaper than they ever were before. People that had no chance of getting their epics ever before now have a shot.<br>
<br>
I still fail to see the bad part.<br>
<br>
The only people really feeling the pinch are guildleaders that snubbed Wizards in their recruitment practices.<br>
<br>
No one else.<br>

Of course their are more epic then ever before, that's the evolution of the game. Luckily in my case a good RL friend of mine is a well known MB wizard and has helped me with my green scale (although I had the guild there in time, but that's a whole other story). I also don't consider it &quot;easier to get&quot; when you have to &quot;get burners&quot; aka HIRE a team to come kill the mob for you. That mentality is getting very close to the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.geocities.com/mana_burner">www.geocities.com/mana_burner</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> website, which is something I doubt many people want to see on Quellious. I'm also not sure what these guild restrictions you are talking about are from. Almost any mid-high level guild could kill a Kunark dragon. As for &quot;excitement&quot; and &quot;challenge&quot; MB will NEVER reach the equal of a raid in those departments. Like I believe Sephrok said before me, did you start the game to be able to click the button and auto-kill? Sounds exciting to me. <p>-<A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=263173">

<br>
Well no Lonin, some people may not think that, and that's why they will camp the mob.<br>
<br>
Like you did.<br>
<br>
VoR was there too, but I was informed you have been camping Sev longer, and had a legitimate claim.<br>
<br>
I guess you don't recall but I was there to get you your scale.<br>
<br>
Yes, piki is a nice guy. If he asks me to come burn something I come.<br>
<br>
I was not paid anything. If other wizards were paid I didn't know anything about it. How much did you pay?<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure you paid nothing, I can't imagine piki charging you.<br>
<br>
So you had the horrible punishment of camping the mob. How awful for you.<br>
<br>
As for the &quot;Manaburn Syndicate&quot;, again, thanks for bringing it up. It was a hoax by people trying to get MB nerfed. It was discovered and it backfired.<br>
<br>

<br>
Indeed. Lonin had that option as well. I have no idea why he got burners instead of his guild to kill Sev. But he had the option. If he wanted 'sense of accomplishment' from his guild killing the dragon then that's what he should have done. Do you think piki would have ganked Sev from him? Or I would? The very person who we were there to get the scale for in the first place?<br>
<br>
Right.<br>

I had been camping Sev, Rapiki is an RL friend and was in the zone too doing sense summoned (beats the heck out of a warrior running around). Yes, I remeber VoR was there, I talked to one of their warriors who got the scale earlier that day (there was 2 patches that day). They gave me and my guild the right-of-way which was cool of them, thanks again. I asked Rapiki to help burn him for extra insurance on the kill. He ended up bringing a team and Sev was killed. It was misunderstanding on his and my part as my guild and I would have much rather have been able to kill ourselves. I worked it all out and in the end I got my scale. Yes I paid nothing for it, we are RL friends, that's to be expected. However, I didn't plan on a team taking down Sev. Very few people can say that have a RL friend MBer that could do something like that for them. I happened to be lucky. However, I would like to thank you for the kill on Sev, I didn't know who was with Rapiki at the time. <p>-<A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=263173">

<br>
wtf are you talking about.<br>
<br>
And as you said, 5s does nothing, so how is that considered nerfing if you, a wizard, says it does nothing anyways?  And if they could program it (hypothetically) so that you wouldn't loose MB if it &quot;didnt take hold&quot; then there wouldn't be an argument against it..<br>
<br>
Archery already has its built in pre-nerf.. can't hit stuff in walls, thats why you rarely see me using archery on raids..  someone said in a post (not sure if its this one) that rangers can solo yellow mobs and thats overpowering.. sorry but yellow mobs happen to do a thing we all like to call &quot;summon&quot;.. =P<br>
<br>
And yea, a ranger can solo Tantor, i have myself, takes 20 mins of kiting.. not easy.. but they can fix that easily by making Tantor summon (he is red to 60..) and i honestly hope they do make him summon.  I solo'd tantor once just to say i did it, not goign to go back and farm him with an &quot;overpowered&quot; AA (in that one instance) that shouldn't be in the game.. and just because i wont do it doens't mean others wont.. if it can be abused it will be, and it shouldn't be able to be abused.. <p><center>
