<br>
I could point to the four months without any drama over the camp except for the continual posts by guilds just finding out about this. I could point out that a standard camp is also not supported by Verant, and that by extension of your logic camp calls are pointless since not everyone will abide by them. But I'm sure you already knew these things.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Pala made his threat post on, what I think, was the assumption that disagreeing with the list implied a covert desire to go ganking Ragefires although no one made such a statement.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Honestly, though - do you think a guild that wants an epic but doesn't agree with the list won't attempt a ganking eventually? What other choice would they have, except perhaps to give up entirely? That's why the pro-list side fights so vehemently to convert people here - better to fight on the message board than to fight in Skyfire.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Barring nuclear holocaust there will always be a line at the post office. At the grocery store.

<br>
The list, whether in this order or in order of the power of people the clerics who want Ragefire can bring along, will always be there. Always. See that list? All those clerics want their epic, and they aren't going anywhere. If someone new wants to claim they're better than those people and should be ahead of them, that's at least honest. But make no mistake - that's what someone that wants to do away with the list is saying to the people on it: I'm better than you, I should go first.<br>

Corrected a capitalization because I'm anal about such things. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Folks - that is what you get if there's no list. People who feel entitlement based on hours /played, and a trampling of the chances of smaller guilds to progress until everyone remotely associated with a fast-mobilizing guild moves on. Is that what you want, Yinta? Jlail? Instead of a list dominated by whatever guilds you feel dominate it now, would it be better if there was no written list but the next few months worth of spawns were dominated by LC, Wraith/Reviv, VM, Explicit/RIP, and the Alliance? Believe it or not, this might be your best chance at a cleric epic. It's certainly the option that has the least amount of hassle.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Jlail, how's it going? Be sure to /hug Stormgarh next time the two of you are on from me! Your points:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have read the post and have seen little or no discussion concerning the points that Yinta made, that being that the list as it currently stands is not working.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Her analysis is based around an assessment of waiting time for someone joining now. As I pointed out above, some of the clerics on that list WILL end up waiting nine months to get their epic if all of them do - all you can do is juggle the order. Like At Death's Door and Wraith before you, you want to juggle the order to get ahead of others. And like ADD and Wraith before, hopefully you'll come to support this and join the list so that in a month's time some other guild can accuse you of stacking the list and being political. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I fail to see how only clerics can engage in logical discussion of this issue &lt;shrug&gt;.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In all solutions I've seen presented here, it's the cleric that has to sit out in Skyfire to get an item that their guild is very keen on them getting. If you want to talk about &quot;fair&quot;, wouldn't it only be fair to let those that make the biggest sacrifice decide how they'll do it? They seem to have come up with a system that's had four gank-free months - why not give them the benefit of the doubt?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I find it very amusing that many of the guilds that have KSed either myself or others in my presence, or who have stated that it is their position that the sever is FFA, can even consider now supporting the list.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
These guilds came to the conclusion, I imagine, that all the effort that they'd have to put into this camp were it FFA would be much better spent in other areas. When Ragefire is FFA, you have to devote a lot of man-hours to get a SHOT at it when it pops. You also have to deal with the inevitable grief that comes when two pullers &quot;don't see&quot; one another, or an &quot;engaged&quot; mob is fired upon. It's not worth it. It's especially not worth the grief it causes the cleric. How would you feel about a new piece of loot if you knew you had to beat someone else that had also sat there for days to get it?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have seen no evidence (although I am sure it is in another thread somewhere) to repudiate any of the following: that non main characters are on the list, that certain guilds seem to be overly represented on the list, that getting on the list is a political exercise, that no consideration is given for having completed other steps of the epic, that the list creation was controlled by a few individuals on the server, that the list is controlled by a few individuals on the server, that stacking of friends and guildmates on the list has been perpetrated by those that control it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Whether non-mains are on the list or not, or should be or not, is a matter for the clerics involved to decide. My guildleader's cleric, Bennea, got her epic by being on the list and she is an alt. She is also an important part of our cleric team, so much so that she is one of the people that is keyed for Vex Thal (roughly half our guild is keyed at this point in time). So the opinion &quot;no alts before mains&quot; is just that - opinion, to be debated and not stated.<br>
<br>
The guilds &quot;overly represented&quot; on the list are undoubtedly those that heard about it when they went to Skyfire to complete a cleric's epic. These are the guilds that have helped support others who were camping Ragefire, who have continued to help, and who have made sure that Ragefire dies as fast as possible and without any despawns. If you're just learning about the list now, is it safe to assume that your guild had not sent anyone to Skyfire to camp Ragefire or to help someone else camp Ragefire recently? And yet now you wish to discuss being more entitled to a spawn than those on the list already? They're putting in work to earn that epic, for themselves and for others. What have you done so far?<br>
<br>
Getting on the list, as far as I know, is a matter of going to Skyfire and talking to the clerics there. I know there are some restrictions on things like certain guilds getting back-to-back spots on the list, but I hadn't heard that it was overly political. Do you have a specific example of someone being denied for political reasons? It would be a good idea to also post that to the Ragefire list board - I'm sure some of the other clerics on the list would be very interested to hear what happened.<br>
<br>
No consideration for other steps completed bothers me, as well. I wouldn't think of putting my name on the list unless I had all pieces ready to go to Timorous Deep. Again, something for the clerics on the list to decide - although seeing Mlain get the heart and not even have the note does irk me.<br>
<br>
List creation was done by people long gone from Skyfire. Who made the original listing (and it was four clerics long) is hardly relevant to today. Stacking of friends and guildmates is inevitable with any list - as people hear about it, they want in. And they'll hear about it sooner if they're guildmates or friends of people on the list, obviously. Controll in the hands of a few people - again, can you give some sort of example of what you mean by this? My understanding was that policy and procedures were decided by those on the list as a whole, not by a select few.<br>
<br>
And Desi. What would this debate be without you? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If every other spawn in the game is handled like that why not Ragefire. You sit your ass down there and you get in line behind the cleric who has been sitting there in front of you. You have to work / sleep ? Get someone to log your toon on and camp it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Waste guild time. Guarantee a gankfest, since CAMPING IS ALSO NOT SUPPORTED BY VERANT. Oh, and for good measure break the Terms of Service for EQ by giving account information to a second party. Yes, I can see how that would be a much more preferrable solution. /boggle<br>
<br>
Ragefire is unlike a standard camp in that the expected spawn time is on the order of days, not hours, and it is not a random probability of spawn. If you want Raster it doesn't matter when you camp him and when you sleep (modulo the game time theories on spawning him) - he's equally likely to pop for you during any of those sessions. If you want Ragefire, you have to stay for days in one sitting to get him. To have that requirement, and then to lump on top of it the chance that someone will come along and simply quote &quot;first to engage&quot; at you is cruel. The list attempts to bring civility to a camp where being civil has never really happened - and for four months, it has succeeded. That's why it's worth supporting. <br>

Forgive me for thinking that that was meant to cause trouble for Radiant, because it sure as hell sounded like it was, especially considering the source. You <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> do</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> take every opportunity you can to flame Radiant, and usually Trist as well.

<br>
And leave of your own free will you may have. Ssra basement is a very strange place to do it, however. I certainly haven't wasted any of the 3-second units of time in between twisting songs to clairify my misconception. I honestly could care less how you left; I'm just glad I never had to deal with you.<br>
<br>
Insufferable pricks, you say? Shaekee stayed for 2 months (or more?) after you left. She must have been impossible to live with. (Note: I'm not flaming Shaekee. She's one of my favorite people. Just trying my damnedest to put a fuckwad in his place.)<br>

The Clerics on the list don't just show up when they are due for Rage, they sit their asses in SF for WEEKS before their Rage is due to spawn and help the current cleric.  Because you have no life and play 50+ hours means that you can basically tell them to Fek off and jump on a Rage spawn because you DESERVE it more? That is the most selfish thing I've ever heard. A FFA on Rage wont work, and its because of lazy ass people like you that it wont.<br>

<br>
And those four peaceful months does not speak for an entire server.<br>
<br>
&quot;I could point out that a standard camp is also not supported by Verant, and that by extension of your logic camp calls are pointless since not everyone will abide by them. But I'm sure you already knew these things.&quot;<br>
<br>
Of course I know, but unlike those in favor of the list I don't carry a &quot;my way or the highway&quot; chip on my shoulder around with me. Nor do I shoot for the worst possible scenario to perpetuate the list (total ANARCHY!), or leave the human factor out of it. It doesn't matter how terrible a camp it is; in an FFA scenario it does not exempt anyone from &quot;not being themselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Honestly, though - do you think a guild that wants an epic but doesn't agree with the list won't attempt a ganking eventually? What other choice would they have, except perhaps to give up entirely?&quot;<br>
<br>
I would *hope* that they don't. The same goes for any scenario. But if there are circumstances that allows a guild to take advantage of a Ragefire kill and pushes the list back another week they've done nothing wrong.<br>
<br>
I hope you don't mean the guild has no choice to abide by the list or give up entirely. That's just begging a response.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's why the pro-list side fights so vehemently to convert people here - better to fight on the message board than to fight in Skyfire.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm all for the fighting. Just don't clump me into a KS/ganker/leapfrogger category because I've said I don't support it.<br>
<br>
&quot;The list, whether in this order or in order of the power of people the clerics who want Ragefire can bring along, will always be there. Always. See that list? All those clerics want their epic, and they aren't going anywhere.&quot;<br>
<br>
::whispers:: It's a camp and camps aren't going away any time soon--for anyone.<br>
<br>
&quot;If someone new wants to claim they're better than those people and should be ahead of them, that's at least honest. But make no mistake - that's what someone that wants to do away with the list is saying to the people on it: I'm better than you, I should go first.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah okay...pro-list people are so much in the right they get to decide how you spend, in part, your monthly $12.95. In fact, they affect how long your subscription will last. Or look at it this way, when it can be terminated. But hey, it's for the betterment of the server.

Everyone here keeps touting how a list makes it so much easier to camp rage and that not everyone has time to camp 24/7.  IMO, that is the biggest flaw in the system, not its biggest advantage.<br>
<br>
First off, here's a statement thats gonna shock you!  If you dont have time to camp 24/7, and someone else does, they deserve it more!  Thats right, they deserve it more!!  If someone else can be on more, they probably will get more use out of their epic right?  An epic in the hands of a cleric that plays every day is going to be rezing a lot more people and spend a lot more time serving its purpose than an epic in the hand of a player that plays 2-3 nights a week max.  Its just a fact.  <br>
<br>
FFA means that those willing and able to work harder, camp longer, and fight him at any time of the day will get their epics first.  Seriously, whats up with people getting on this list and even killing ragefire when they haven't even finished the other stuff?  They do not deserve it as much as someone who worked hard and got the rest of their stuff.  You want it, you camp it.  You cant camp it, you cant get it.  Simple, effective, and puts the ability to get your epic in your control instead of being dependent on when you found out about some list.<br>
<br>
I know this sounds elitest, but I am simply pointing out the principal truth that most people dont like to admit and that list systems are designed to avoid.  A cleric that plays several hours every day should not have to wait in line behind a bunch of 1-2 day a week clerics simply because some list says they should.  The cleric that plays more and is willing to put in the necessary effort deserves it more.  If you want it bad enough, you'll find a way to camp it and get it.  If you cant find a way, you obviously dont want it bad enough. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufeadornlifegiver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feadorn Lifegiver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 94<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/12/02 11:10:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=155>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Thats right, they deserve it more!!

Not always true. And actually, most clerics take quite a bit of time off after they get their epic.  And i cannot count the number of clerics who quit the game shortly after getting their epics.  Just because the FFA camp was so mentally draining.  They ended up saying 'just fuck it' to the game.<br>
<br>
I spent 7 straight weeks in SF and the last 3 weeks on 24/7.  I dont play any more now than before the camp.<br>

I think the poster child for this List being good would be Syllie. Anyone that knows her can attest that she is one of the nicest people on this server, hands down, yet had it not been for the list, she would not have gotten Rage. Why? you may ask? Not because her Guild (Lor Mani) couldn't kill Rage (they can, and have) but she despised the FFA system, and wanted nothing to do with the hatred it caused amongst clerics (remember all those Rage Flames back in the day?  ) so she refused to camp Rage, even though 95% of her guild told her she should and they would help her. But when the list formed, she was able to get a spot on it (she was like 9 or 10 from the start I think) and she parked her butt in SF for well over a month helping her fellow clerics out with their Rage camps, and after alot of patience and ALOT of dead wyverns and wurms while waiting for her turn, she got her Rage, with the help of her guild and also that of 4 or 5 others (mobilized 50+ people at 4 AM  ) She was able to get her epic piece without anyone else getting hurt in the process[/b]<br>
<br>
this is exactly the type of person that is likely out there and doesn't even know that this list exists.  for sure she wouldn't have met you guys at the camp in Skyfire when she went to camp the spawn in what she thinks is a FFA camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
[b] Nape :
I don't understand how people can flame those who created, supported, or waited on the list. If you missed out a few months ago when the list was started, could that possibly be that you weren't ready for that part of the epic yet? God forbid.[/b]<br>
<br>
define &quot;ready for that part of the epic&quot;.  if it means &quot;reads this bulletin board or knows someone on the list&quot; than i agree.  if it means &quot;only needs ragefire left to kill&quot;, than i think we've seen that this list doesn't really imply that sort of readiness.  most interestingly, this list doesn't even try to establish that type of readiness.<br>
<br>
<br>
[b] Salubre :
All you can have is agreements between groups of people, which is what the list is about...CLERICS AGREEING, some dont for various reasons but I have yet to see someone done up to rage, needing rage and non-ebayed disagree with the list and speak out on it.

Doesnt that say something to all of you non clerics??!?[/b]<br>
<br>
i'm speaking out on it, but i don't have all the parts yet.  while i'm gathering them, i'm not sure that i'll have a revelation.  i like this list better than FFA, but this list to me needs to get advertised more and needs to use consistent standards of worthiness to be on the list.<br>
<br>
<br>
[b] Feadorn:
You cannot prove or disprove if someone has done it all or not. And the way that the quest is set up, you dont have to be done up to this point. Again, this was covered on the Clerics board. Also, if you take a screen shot, it can be faked.[/b]<br>
<br>
but you don't even try.  i see posted all over the place that anyone that jumps the list will be blacklisted and everyone will hate them (sometimes followed by a statement that this isn't a threat), and yet you don't even make an attempt to self-police.  you won't try to get *your* ducks in a row, yet you are establishing guidelines for everyone else.<br>
<br>
<br>
[b] Rapiki:
First off, here's a statement thats gonna shock you! If you dont have time to camp 24/7, and someone else does, they deserve it more! Thats right, they deserve it more!! If someone else can be on more, they probably will get more use out of their epic right? An epic in the hands of a cleric that plays every day is going to be rezing a lot more people and spend a lot more time serving its purpose than an epic in the hand of a player that plays 2-3 nights a week max. Its just a fact.[/b]<br>
<br>
dunno if you noticed, but people get rezzed day-in and day-out all over norrath without the use of an epic.<br>
<br>
the power of an epic over casting the spell is the lowered downtime after the cast.  the cases where that matters most are on raids.  the difference when you've got one person on the raid with an epic versus zero people on the raid with an epic is absolutely incomparable to when you've got two people with epic on a raid versus just one.  the difference only gets smaller as you project from there.  the interesting thing here is that the high power guilds that can get to and kill this spawn the fastest, almost need it the least.  if you regularly raid with multiple people who have an epic, clicky resurrect is not going to make an amazing impact on your life, and shockingly enough there are items out there with comparable stats.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
what i would like to see changed is this :<br>
<br>
1. make it a requirement that all pieces up to Ragefire be completed.  you can't verify this 100%.  you *can* require the person asking to be on the list state that they are this far into their epic.  you *can* post names of people that you learn are lying.<br>
<br>
2. consider taking away the unquestioned, unilateral authority of the first person on the list to add people to it.  if the rest of the list has to support you when you're on the list, it should require more than one person's support to get you onto it.  maybe i'm wrong, maybe this makes it too political.  i'd almost rather it be political like this than the way it looks now.<br>
<br>
3. put a limit of 2 people per guild on the list at the same time.  if you left a guild that has 2 people on the list now within the last 2 months, you count as being in that guild.  this rule will make the list shorter.  the list being shorter will mean that your 3rd person gets onto it more quickly.<br>
<br>
4. if there are still 50 people who have all their pieces up to ragefire, i think you should shorten the list.  i think that after 6-10 slots or so (enough slots to plan out your &quot;vacation&quot;.  wow, that word is so ill-suited to this camp), the rest of the people should be randoming to fill the end of that 6-10 person list as someone gets their ragefire.  make it a weighted roll based on 100+10*turns waited or something, so that you have a better chance to get that slot than someone new.<br>
<br>
those are just some ideas.  it seems to me that they could help with *some* of the problems that people have with the list.  i understand that there are some people who will never approve of a list though. <p><b><a href="http://www.theoutwardeye.com/">&lt;Outward Eye&gt;</a><br><font face="tahoma"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23942" target="_blank">Brazzo</a>, L53 Cleric<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23987">Grazzo GrubGrabber</a>, L44 Druid<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=144397" target="_blank">Hexxal</a>, L38 Shadowknight<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=94223" target="_blank">Vexxal</a>, L37 Warrior</font><br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23993">Aaalpha [Lute]</a>, L18 Bard</font></b></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uhexxal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hexxal</A> at: 8/12/02 11:38:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ufeadornlifegiver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Feadorn Lifegiver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 95<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/13/02 12:09:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=157>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> but you don't even try. i see posted all over the place that anyone that jumps the list will be blacklisted and everyone will hate them (sometimes followed by a statement that this isn't a threat), and yet you don't even make an attempt to self-police. you won't try to get *your* ducks in a row, yet you are establishing guidelines for everyone else.<br>

No, you dont, you did not stick with it because it was not for you and this is a prime example of why our mindsets are different and why YOU look at the list in a different perspective than clerics that have lvld and put the time in to complete to rage and be ready to engage him.<br>

Not only do you need to be a cleric to comprehend the levity of the rage camp, you also need all those nights playing a cleric to understand what this bottle neck truly means.<br>
Not to mention what all of you putting your worthless arguments over and over again to no freakin end does to the mindset of said clerics. <br>
stfu already, you are all bringin us down.<br>

I shall quote myself now as you all seem to only reply to things that you can justify spewing BS about.<br>

I wont be posting here on this subject anymore, Yint has gone to the cleric boards where this discussion is better off.<br>
<br>
And reading this shit honestly discourages me from even wanting to play my cleric, we are doing something for ourselves, something good, we can figure it out, fuck off.<br>

This nicely encapsulates the whole discussion - this is about a small portion of the server telling the rest of us how to play - no thanks.<br>
