<br>
I was approached by several clerics. They wanted to know my views on the Ragefire list that has been set up on Quellious. I first started reading about this list a month ago. I've read, I've talked to clerics and I've thought about the pros and cons of this list.<br>
<br>
I have decided...I think this list is wrong. Also I know several Clerics that think this list is wrong. I also know several Guilds that think this list is wrong. I am hoping that that they post and tell you their feelings on this matter.<br>
<br>
I joined the cleric chat channel Saturday and tried to start a discussion about my qualms with the list. I was immediately threatened with...we dont care if you like it...we have the force, so you cant ks us. During the course of this discussion I was told that if I fought this list my reputation and the reputation of my guild would be damaged. When the people on the chat channel found out they couldnt intimidate me then the chat became  a little more civalized. I kept reiterating that I wasnt there to threaten them but to discuss the list.<br>
<br>
This list, although well intentioned, it is unfair. The  requirements to get on the list are ridiculous and humiliating to the cleric wanting on the list. Do you realize that in order for a cleric to get on this list they have to sit in Skyfire for 6 hours (I know someone who was made to do this) to prove their worthiness to be on the list. I am here to tell you I dont have to prove my worthiness to any one on this server. I'm not quite sure why the people controling the list feel this is nessecary. Every reason I come up with is very insulting so I wont post them.<br>
<br>
This list goes against Verant's rules. Quellioius is a FFA Server. This was stated when the lists for Fear and Hate were gotten rid of.<br>
<br>
I see several people on the list from the same guild. I see several people on the list who have at least one or more charactors that already have epics. <br>
<br>
But the main reason this list is unfair...not everyone had the same oportunity to get on the list at the same time. I keep hearing it would have been imposible to tell every cleric on the server about the list. Let me ask you ... did you tell your guild about the list and your friends about the list? So your friends and guild are probably on the list.<br>
<br>
Also, I dont see the Ragefire spawn being any different than any other epic spawn. They dont do this for Faye, they dont do this for the dragans, i can't think of any other epic spawn this done for. So why Rage.<br>
<br>
I was also told that &quot;all&quot; the big guilds support this list. I have talked to a big guild, and I have been told that two other big guilds don't support this list. So that is three what I consider big guilds that dont support this list.<br>
<br>
I am going to recommend that my Guild not follow this list. If two or more clerics want to camp rage then it can be petitioned or go by what ever the correct Vernant sanctioned rules are.<br>
<br>
To ask people, that didn't know about the list at its inception to wait until March or April of next year to fight Rage Fire is ridiculous.<br>
<br>
For those of you who think this is sour grapes...I have my epic. I have had it for a year now. That is why I am posting, the clerics without their epics are being intimidated by the people running the list. These arent my words but the words of the clerics talking to me.<br>
<br>
Please post your feelings pro or con...<br>
<br>
Just trying to let you know what is going on.<br>

<br>
1. Do not claim to be the representative of the downtrodden without being able to produce at least a few of said downtrodden. I (nor, I imagine, anyone else) will take your word for it.<br>
<br>
2. This list came to be because Rage was the most contested spawn in the game, bar none. KS'ing and backstabbing was frequent. There are not many people who are willing to see it go back to that- myself amongst them. I have put myself at the service of any cleric that's camping Rage in accodance with the list before, and will remind them that it's an option now. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3. VI's policy is 'First sufficient force in zone'- IE, if you've got the people there to kill it, it's yours. You will be hard pressed to beat the mobilization of a good chunk of the guilds on the server to get Rage first.<br>
<br>
I respect your forwardness, and I agree the list isn't perfect. But it's the best we've come up with, and that's all there is to it. It might suck, but it's better than camping Rage for a month and getting your spawn KS'd every time. <p>Lauriston Pianoforte<br>That Guy<br>Bard of Quellious</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ururarksoulhunter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rurark Soulhunter</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/12/02 12:03:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> To anyone that is not a cleric out there think what you would do if your last epic piece was a 9 month waiting list.  A list that has secondary characters on it for sure, and most likely people who are not even to that point yet.  Personally I would not like that fact one bit, and would not stand for such a list.  Ragefire is the higest contested spawn in game, and that is no players fault, but to make clerics who just want there epic wait on a list for over 8 months when secondary characters are ahead of them is rediculous.  <br>

<br>
So, is the list as it is more fair that the situation prior to the list?  In my opinion, no, it isn't.  People found out about the list at varying times and the people who decide who goes on the list at this point are people who are already on the list.  In my opinion a list setup as this one has been was at the least unfair at it's inception and at the worst screaming<br>
for abuse in it's continued use.<br>
<br>
Prior to the list RF was a poorly conceived step in the cleric epic quest (well, I suppose after the list as well :*)  ).  However, the rules regarding it were layed out by VI and everybody on the server had equal access to those rules at the same time.  With the list, a subset of the server made rules of it's own, then expected the rest of the server<br>
to follow those rules regardless of when they learn about them.  To ensure that threatens to KS any RF from a cleric not on the list trying to take it (I can't help but say, note the irony here, we're sick of people KSing RF, so we're going to establish our own rules, and anybody who doesn't like them we KS).<br>
<br>
However well intentioned the list was at it's start, I honestly don't think it's better than RF was.<br>
<br>

Sorry to tell you, but if we all went by &quot;Verants rules&quot; hardly anything would be accomplished, this  list was set up to avoid conflict, not create a race for who can pull 5 burners out of their pocket faster. But I guess since you already have your epic, you just say let dog eat dog eh? Sorry, but I'm not one for seeing someone camp and wait for their epic for weeks, just to get hopped over by someone who doesn't want to wait like the current cleric did.<br>

So you're saying their twinks arent allowed to get epic? Maybe they've put more time into their alt then a random cleric has put into their main? Maybe they're more deserving? Whatever it is, its not yours to question, twink or not, it still benefits them, and they deserve it if they want to do this hellacious camp with their twink. I don't see anyone flaming the 3000 druid twinks with their epic?<br>

<br>
If you're even comparing Fay to Rage you're just screaming &quot;Flame me!&quot; Fay is a triggered 23(ish?) hour spawn, rage takes days of planning and hoping and camping, the reason Fay isn't listed is because its EASY to get. (More so then ragefire anyway)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Having just finished helping a friend camp ragefire non stop, I'll admit, its not fun, and having to sit there 6 hours is a breeze compared to what you really have to go through to get it, this list was created to make it that much easier, so they dont have to camp it for up to a week AGAIN when someone comes in and KS's it while you've been there waiting for it.<br>
The last thing this server needs is MORE competition for already extremely contested spawns.<br>

<br>
<br>
I mean you cant just say start a new list TIME now because your own argument can still be used against the new list.  YOU DIDNT TELL EVERYONE.<br>
 <br>
Your just proposing go back.  and then you say you got your epic a year ago.  And i say the way it is now is SOOOO much worse then it was a year ago without a system.  You want to edge back into that insanity by walking over the list.  Im telling you if you do prepare to have enemies.  Its not a threat. its advise.<br>
<br>
The animosity at ragefire was literally spilling out into other zones.   If you want GREY SOLDIERS to go that route you WILL have a server GM contested ragefire eventually.  You WILL have a conflict over a non skyfire mob because of ragefire animosity.   You will be frustrated in places not even remotely related to the cleric epic over the animosity gained in skyfire. Its not a reflection of the guild its the system.<br>
<br>
Im not threatening you.  Im just telling you that lots of guilds thought they could peacefully FFA ragefire.  That those rant threads here would never apply to their guild.  THEN BAMM.  Suddenly what could never be your guild is spilled all over the rant boards.<br>
<br>
 Why?<br>
<br>
Before this list nearly every rage in skyfire involved a GM.  The GMs took the tack that you needed 2 groups to camp ragefire.  You going to keep 2 groups with your cleric at all times grey soldiers? Now you know how fights start over FFA.  With manaburn the 2 group camp rule and mana burn will show nasty consequences quick.  Right now its calm &quot;ok we're all going to respect 1 cleric as a camper. and we're going to use a list&quot;  You want to go back to &quot;ok we're all going to use one cleric and get rid of the list because the list isnt verants rules&quot;  News flash: one cleric camping rage isnt verants rules either. And thats where your going to get most frustrated.   &quot;He so ever that is justified by the law is a debtor to the whole of the law&quot;  <br>
<br>
If you shake up the list now youll shake up the one cleric camp rule.  Now you know how the animosity at the new rage was spilling out into other zones.   It will be worse this pass if you step over the list.  We got a cleric up next and my advise to my guild would be to just step back.   The enemies that come out of that wave of rage ganks that you initiated isnt anything i want to be near.  It just wont transition peacefully.  <br>
<br>
 for exampe: You want to share HoT with a guild that you just got into a server GM contested Ragefire with?   you might be leaving hot. its  just an example.  and not a threat!!!  jeez im just saying think here.  I mean when you got a guild that you share an extreme animosity with albeit through obviously no wrong action of your own sharing a raid zone with you the game is no stinking fun.  Doesnt matter if your right.  what was a fun raid is now a stressful pisser regardless if you were right at ragefire.  I like the server the way it is now at my tier.  its calm.  i cant think of any tension at my tier right now.   Everyone makes way for everyone.  its cool.   Your risking all of that by putting rage back on FFA.  Please dont.  <br>
<br>
for &quot;fairness&quot; on one epic your willing to put guild server relations which i feel have been calmer then i have ever known them on this server at risk?  Thats what your doing here.   You want us to go on a campless FFA ragefire binge and we would all be fools to think we could escape that both with epics and without enemies...<br>
<br>
I mean if you remember nothing else remember nearly every rage that popped was contested here and to the server GM when it was FFA skyfire.  Nearly EVERY rage.    You want to get back in that? <br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry bout use of &quot;Grey Soldiers&quot;  just a guild name  that advise was generic to anyone contiplating leaving the list system now. <br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
OH last but not least lets not forget a primary source of petitions and conflicts between guilds in skyfire from a FFA system.<br>
YOU CAN DESPAWN RAGE BY ENGAGING IT WITH INSUFFICIENT FORCE.<br>
<br>
That was a nasty source of petitions.   Remember  &quot;we were kiting it&quot; followed by &quot;you were going to allow it to despawn so we took it&quot; (as an archetype).  It would have been so much better if it just stayed up.  As it sits in a despawns FFA people are jumpy over the fact that it despawns if the dragon form isnt kept engaged.<br>

For most guilds it means the cessation of raids until their cleric gets Ragefire.  And it isn't just one week, it is at least 2 weeks long.  The guild is called to start camping Ragefire one spawn before to make sure their cleric has a &quot;right&quot; to claim the camp.  Then it's 2 weeks worth of camping with at least 2 groups.  This is what you are suggesting happen.  And when it gets closer to the spawn time for Ragefire, you are asking as many guild members as possible to be in Skyfire.<br>
<br>
Most guilds can not staff 2 groups 24/7 in a zone.  Imagine what you are asking the server to revert to.  If you can think up a better system (other than just objecting) then do so.  If you think FFA is the answer, look back at the number of flames that happened over Ragefire before the list and the number of flames after the list.<br>
<br>
No the list isn't fair but I would hate Ragefire to go back to being FFA also.<br>

Looking at that list is fairly suspect as well - only clerics with a vested intrest in keeping the list their way are on it.<br>
<br>
 One interesting point is if its the same group of people mobalizing to kill rage each spawn for that list - guess what your monopolizing the spawn and if someone petitions you a gm will make ya roll if they get a force there as well. <br>
<br>
 Its interesting that most of the hate in this thread is from the people who are for the list - interesting that now people have so easily become what they profess to hate. Just because its you monopolizing the spawn as opposed to someone else dont make it right.<br>

<br>
As to the only people on it being those who have an interest in keeping it that way?  How so?  I know a couple of LC clerics have been on that list and have honored that list.  I am pretty sure LC, VM, and Wraith could mobilize and take rage down faster than most of the smaller guilds.  This is better.  Not all the higher end guilds have all their epics.  Lots still want them.  You really want to be racing against guilds that have much much more experience at mobilizing and racing to mobs?  The list at least gives clerics not in a huge or high end guild the chance to get their epic.  Something a lot of them may never have.<br>
<br>
Edit - I used the examples of LC VM and Wraith not as a threat of what any of us/them would do but an extreme example of the differenece in mobilization time guilds can have. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=143487">

There are going to be a great number of clerics who will never see there epic because VI is determined to only let so many in in a year.  Maybe you dont understand that clerics getting along is better than clerics fighting.  <br>
<br>
And yes, there have been other spawns in this game that have used the same system.  See above link.<br>
<br>
You want to limit whos on the list to one per guild?  Heck, i would have just disbanded and then got mine.  Any cleric should have a chance to get an epic.<br>

<br>
Ragefire is a bitch. That's why I've decided not to help a cleric with it (if I can get away with it), list or no list. It's queer that people who agreed on the list hold to the idea that players will be better people for avoiding confrontation altogether. Maybe I always thought legislating morality is too close to a utopian mirage for my taste.<br>
<br>
The way I see it, there is no alternative to a list. It's either FFA (with likely squabbling) or, The List (and subsequent club-toting enforcers ready to verbally lash out). I don't care how much confrontation this list can quell. It is totally unfair to ask a player to hold out on his epic for all the good it does. The unfairness grows as the list grows, which may stretch out so far into the future that EQI may be over with. By then I'd feel like a fool for holding myself to others' views of fair/unfair.<br>
<br>
There's too much blame being shifted on the camp itself and a reluctance to hold people responsible for their actions. Scapegoats make great items of conversation when you want to overlook your friend being blinded by epic fever and acting on impulse.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/bquelliousquaterstherebirth.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=saltamontes>Saltamontes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><font color=Green>Moderator</font></span><br>  Posts: 393<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/12/02 8:12:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> PS  The other reason Xocin is in favor of the list is he'd rather sit on his ass in the bazaar all day rather than exp in skyfire to help maintain sufficient force (he's such a lazy sob!). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uordocdacrusher.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ordoc Dacrusher</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(8/12/02 8:39:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=465.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire List</span><hr size=1> I support Yinta in this.

&quot;If you wish to try your hand at ganking DB, be forwarned that we will take this as an intentional ganking and the consequences are forwarned.&quot;<br>

<br>
I'm sorry that your guild was cheated out of a warrior epic, Pala, but the same animosity does not warrant every occasion.<br>
<br>
There is no &quot;ganking&quot; if you're there first, you trigger first, and you engage first. I don't care how much you think your friends deserve the epic.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever guild ganks us will be put on our /who all lists and tracked 24/7, also our scout force ( very good one ) will ensure your guild is where we think you are. Whatever mob you engage will be ganked out from underneath you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Once again, there is no &quot;ganking&quot; if you engage first. But there is leapfrogging. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;DB will make sure that your guild is as miserable and unable to do anything it may desire to do in the future.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yeah...all because a friend is somehow &quot;cheated&quot; out of an epic because they're not fast enough. I hope making threats is dearly worth it. Let the club-toting continue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a
