The cleric epic is different because more than any other epic (even wiz and chanter epics.. or the manaless dots on sham/dru/nec epics)... it's irreplacable.<br>
<br>
They should have never put such a game-changing effect on an item like that, really.  It's not just a nice item... a cleric with one is like a whole other animal to one without.  <br>
<br>
Oh well, too late now.... the mess that is Ragefire camp is the result.<br>

Feadorn simply told him what his intentions were when Rage finally did pop, wait a few for Doc's guild to engage then call in his own help. That seems to be alot more neighborly a thing to do then verbally attack like Quasqueton.<br>

 Also, the list wont work until you can include every rage needing cleric on the server, as it stands now only those that are in your circle of friends that made the list stand to gain much. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ukeldoreth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keldoreth</A> at: 6/5/02 12:57:19 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/uzeddicous.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeddicous</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Guk Knight</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/5/02 12:54:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ragefire Waiting List?</span><hr size=1> I'm not too sure I agree that the cleric epic is irreplaceable.  Back in the days of Kunark, it was powerful indeed but that doesn't really hold true today.  I'll preface my argument by saying I'm not some wizard spewing crap about a topic he doesn't know anything about in the first place.  My alt is a level 56 cleric.  He's not a twink and never has been.  He could easily wear the label of &quot;my main&quot;.  The only reason he doesn't is because I tend to play my wizard more.<br>
<br>
The only real argument you here about how awesome the cleric epic is that a &quot;huge raid&quot; could recover from a total wipeout quickly.  The points I'll make now are from a cleric's point of view and also will make a couple of assumptions.  If it really is a &quot;huge raid&quot; I'm going to assume that I'm not the only cleric there.  I will also assume that there is some of each class present.<br>
<br>
The biggest difference that I have noticed between Kunark and now is the manapool.  Verant raised the cap for INT/WIS to be more in line with the caps the melee types get for STR and such.  If I understand semi-correctly how the mana pool is calculated you can raise you're mana by about 25% just from taking advantage from the raise in the cap.  At level 56, I can cast rez 5 times without ever having to med, and that's without any kind of enchanter buffs.  I'm by no means well equiped and I'm sure some of the more established clerics can do even better than that.  This is where the &quot;huge raid&quot; scenario takes form.  With C3 (or even C2), the bard song, AA points in mana regen, and maybe the occassional necro twich, I'll be at full mana again long before the rez effects are gone from whoever I just rezzed.  With the paladins, druids, and even rangers taking care of the post-rez heals as able this only speeds up the process.  Epic or not, there are still lenghty rez effects.  If you use that time wisely, I don't see much difference.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, the cleric epic is a handy thing to have around.  However, it's not near a requirement like it used to be.  The simple fact is that it casts a level 56 vendor spell.<br>
<br>
Feel free to tell me how wrong I am,<br>

I'm very glad I found it. I will try and keep my comments brief as I know long posts tend to get ignored.<br>
<br>
To Feadorn (and hopefully the officers of ADD):<br>
If you rest on the laurels of previous GM decisions and to some degree the PnP policy, you are certainly correct in saying that the first party with forces sufficient to complete the encounter will (not necessarily &quot;should&quot;) be the one awarded the kill/loot. While previous actions could, due to human nature, warrant a more merciless/legalistic approach to managing these encounters, I would implore you to examine the events that have taken place on this server in the past few months and appreciate the evolution of order that has grown in SF amongst these clerics (and guilds).<br>
<br>
As many have already said, this is (in practice), not a list. I have seen examples on other servers and when that list reaches 70 people, the natural inclination is to take the approach you have already proposed. I have lobbied hard (to some success I might add), to keep the list below 10 to avoid just such a scenario. What has evolved is much better than a list. it is a small alliance of priests (gender neutral for those PC folks out there &lt;g&gt;) that are committed to helping each other complete what is a very unreasonable encounter.<br>
<br>
While your guild is within its right (according to game rules) to contest that spawn and attempt to compete with that evolved order, I would encourage you to embrace it, participate and (heaven forbid) maybe let this encounter creep into other similar encounters (PoF Wraith being a great example) and try and ressurrect (pardon the pun) the semblance of order that existed prior to the original QQ's demise.<br>
<br>
The work that I have seen with Jeannie, Sassami, Gruff, Bennea, Batto, and Syllie has been truly one of the better experiences for me in the game. After hopefully completing my epic, I will consistently try and make myself and members of my guild that are available participants in this system as I think it is a terrific example of what human cooperation can be.<br>
<br>
In closing, I'm not asking for half a day to gather the forces necessary to complete my ragefire encounter, merely that you respect (hopefully participate) the level of cooperation that exists currently and grant the camping cleric (in this case, of course being me) REASONABLE opportunity to raise a force sufficient to kill both forms. Per our conversation, I do not believe 10 minutes is sufficient time. Nor do I think 2 hours is reasonable for me to monopolize a spawn. While I would love for ADD to assist in these efforts, in lieu of that I would at least ask that you respect the time that has been invested and permit myself (and future clerics) a fair chance at completing their epic. If we fail in that endeavor, your guild (and any others for that reason) is well within your rights to pursue closure in light of my failure. Of course, I'll never refuse assistance (even in the case of failure) to complete the encounter.<br>

However, I want to reinforce one point made earlier by two of my officers.<br>
<br>
If Rage pops, and the cleric currently at the top of the list needs help, please feel free to ask for DoSG's help. We're a mainly GMT based guild (although apparently we have a noticable presence most of the day now, lol), so might be a good resource if he pops out of some people's regular playtime.<br>
<br>
We as a guild want to do everything we can to foster the idea of people co-operating and helping each other with things like this - I know realistically it's impossible to achieve niceness everywhere, but it's got to be worth a try. <p><body>

ADD havent got a Ragefire pop since Mitsy got her epic. I would say thats at least 8 months ago, maybe over a year. It was before i joined.<br>
<br>
We've tried, but had various reasons for not getting them. Now all of a sudden, this rule has been put in, and now we have to wait another few months before one of our clerics can camp Rage, then another few months for another. Thats assuming the guilds that dont obbey by these rules/dont read this site dont come and take it. If they dont read this board, they're not gonna care how much you flame.<br>
<br>
What Feadorn is implying, is that if the epic is a priority to the said clerics guild/friends, then if you REALLY wanna camp it, then the whole guild/friends should camp it. If you cant get the support, then its obviously not a high priority and this stupid list that not everyone reads and obeys should be scrapped.<br>
<br>
And dont go on about level being a reason not to have epic. There isnt a rule to say when you should get your epic (unless you made one?). I know several clerics that got their epic before 56, and i know even more other classes with epics before 60. If the said person works hard enough for their epic, they shouldnt be told they cant get their final piece cus they're not 60.<br>

Hi, as a member of the aforementioned guild I'd like to take the time to respond.  When we're raiding we have the ability to mobilize for a RF kill in minutes, why would we waste 3 weeks of time we could be raiding sitting in SF?  If you weren't aware LC has had members take part in killing every single RF spawn (some times having more members show up than the guild attempting to actually kill RF).  <br>
<br>
Sorry you don't appreciate the help as much as the clerics that were actually camping RF and sorry us having more people help kill RF than most guilds over the 3 weeks this has been going on is too much of a &quot;weak link&quot; for you. <p>Salta

I know I speak for UP. If you need help on this spawn please send anyone in guild a tell i'm sure we will respond with what we can muster. All that we can hope is that each member of the (hell I'm calling it a list) is going to have to respond quick with help from their respective guilds. In time, and with some respect from (some other more respectable) other guilds. This will work. And yes, maybe some of the other more contentious spawns can get more order too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub54.ezboard.com/ublaloceanos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Blal Oceanos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Froglok Dar Knight</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#00CCFF>(6/5/02 8:02:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub54.ezboard.com/fquelliousquaterstherebirthfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=654.topic&index=94>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I guess its time for me to chime in...</span><hr size=1> Welcome back Quellious Quarters!<br>

Basically, when your turn to camp Rage comes, you're basically (from what I've been told) expected to be there 24/7... and should have a decent showing of people there with you.  This isnt done for any other reason than to discourage others from moving in and attempting to take over.  The whole thing with this current camp is that a group of clerics (most of whom did NOT know each other prior to the camp)  who banded together and are working with each other to get their epics.  They are literally spending weeks together... rotating shifts, etc.  And you can be sure that when Rage is scheduled to pop, they have a force ready.<br>
<br>
And Blal... you mention 8 months.  Let's put that into perspective please.  Rage hasnt been in SF for 8 months... so I cant comment on why ADD didnt get him back during the old SolB camp.  The new Rage had been broken for about 2 months from what I remember... so not only has ADDnot gotten a lot of clickers... no one else has either.  LM has 2 Cleric epics total... the first was Thoras... whom I believe was the 3rd epic on the server.  The second was Bralan... who got his well over a year ago in SolB.  By using your logic, I could easily say &quot;Hey!  Why are there 2 LC clerics ahead of Syllie when LC already has clickers galore?&quot;.  Answer?  Who cares?  They are putting in their time, and helping the other clerics.... even the non-LC ones.  Syllie has been 60 for months, and has been ready for Rage for close to a year now.  Yet not only DOESNT she complain, she's trying to help where necessary.<br>
<br>
My issue was with Feadorn, and his attitude.  Period.  From what I was told (by people who were there, and whom I trust), he walked in to SF, and started badgering DocLotus and the other clerics.  This was low class.  Period.<br>
<br>
I spoke to Garrador about this, and during our conversation, was informed that ADD has no intention of respecting the list.  That's fine... seriously.  As said from the beginning, this was never &quot;official&quot;.  It's a gentleman's agreement of clerics dedicated to helping each other.  If ADD, or anyone else, dont care to follow suit, that's well within their rights.... but it in no way excuses Faedorn or his actions.<br>
<br>
He had no excuse.  No whatsoever.<br>
<br>
But in all fairness... I'm throwing him to the head of the list... my list.  The list of &quot;People I wouldnt piss on you if they were on fire&quot;. <p><center>

I did not hide anything.  I have also let my feelings be felt on this thread.  I dont like the fact that a few have started a list, or reservation system.  I dont like the fact that those few are the ones who are creating the rules for it.  Rules that allow a guild to reserve a spot for a cleric to be named later.  A rule that the you dont want the list to grow beyond 10.  What happens when cleric number 11 comes along?  Does he/she need to camp for the next rage just so that they can be put on the list next?  Your are correct, you have created a small alliance of priests and ignoring the bigger picture.<br>
<br>
Lauriston, No one from my guild will flame anyone on this thread... this is not the Flame Forum.  We will not engage in posts like one other has so far in this thread.<br>
<br>
Blal, its has been more than 18 months since mitsy got her epic.  It was done with the Sol B Rage Fire.  The Ragefire that got lost in the wall.  I have been playing this game for nearly three years now.  Just because this character is only 54 means nothing when going after an epic.<br>
<br>
Salta, You are correct, your guild can move fast...but if there is a guild already there, it could take as little as 6 seconds to kill Rage.  <br>
<br>
Quasqueton, Mitsy is the ONLY cleric that our guild has gotten a click stick for.  The SF Rage has been broken for a lot longer than 2 months..more like 8 or so.  I can look up when it was changed if you would like.<br>
<br>
I did not walk into SF and badger Doclotus.  He sent me a tell and i thought it prudent to be upfront with him about my intentions...  I did not want to hide anything from him.. I also did not send a tell to ANY of the other clerics that were there.  I was only talking to Doclotus.  Please tell me what i did wrong by letting him know my intentions after he sent me a tell?  I have logs if you wish to see, and doclotus can confirm their accuracy.<br>
<br>
**EDIT**<br>
Bennea did send me a tell and we talked a bit.  I told her the samething that i told doclotus as well as my statments that I have made on this msg board.<br>

<br>
let's start with common ground, <br>
<br>
this set up by VI is FUBAR<br>
<br>
MANY clerics and guilds want this dumb mob<br>
<br>
Sufficient force is the policy that is heavily bantered, but the equally stupid &quot;be-nice&quot; policy is heavily ignored.<br>
<br>
<br>
My hope is that this can rise above a playground level mentality.  Is what the clerics are trying to do flawed? yep.  But how about offering solutions?  I have offered my help, when i'm in game, for what it is worth.<br>
<br>

&quot;I spoke to Garrador about this, and during our conversation, was informed that ADD has no intention of respecting the list.&quot;<br>
<br>
I did not say we dont respect the list, I told you that we would give sufficient time for the person on the head of the list to get folks together....if you cant get folks to sit with the cleric and/or be there in ten minutes, then its unfair for folks to try and delay a group of people already amassed to take Ragefire.<br>
<br>
While I do aggree the list has its good intentions, its unfair for folks to try and set precedent and expect others across the server to follow suit. <br>
<br>
And also folks kiting a mob does not constitute ownership. <br>
<br>
While I have nothing against Doclotus or any other clerics on that list I will defend my guilds rights to try and acquire the cleric epic and try to do it with some form of decency and fairness. <br>
<br>
I was never a big fan of the old list system, the last I looked I also pay for the game and would like to accomplish things as well. Not trying to buck the system, but as long as I have supporters in my guild and out of my guild I will do what it takes to accomplish certain things in this game short of being a total @#%$ or illegal.<br>
<br>
As you all have noticed not one ADD member has flamed anybody so far on this subject.....and rightfully so because this is a general discussion area. The whole misconception that all of ADD is a bunch of asses is a total farce.<br>
<br>
Every guild has had their share of bad apples, and up until recently we had a good bushell of them. But that is changing and we are trying to be more proactive with regards to recruiting and such.<br>
<br>
So we shall see what the next ragefire spawn brings us and I wish all the clercs good luck on getting their epic. This spawn has been one of the worst things I have seen in this game since I started playing very long ago. <p>Garaddor Ghoulbane
