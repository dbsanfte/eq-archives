Why are the parents being blamed for these things?? Where the heck are the teachers when this stuff happens? We leave our children in the care of the public school system to be taught by these 'teachers' and this is what happens. Then to top it off, we parents get blamed for what happens when our children are not even in our care. We can teach our kids right from wrong and they can be well behaved when they are with us, but when they go off to school or to a friends house or anywhere that we leave that child in the care of another adult, it is now their responsibility to make sure everyone is safe.<br>
<br>
Here is my story:<br>
<br>
Late in the afternoon about a month or so ago I got a call from my sons (a 7 yo first grader) school. They told me that I needed to pick up my son right away. He was being suspending for having a knife at school and the situation was being brought to the attention of the school board for further punishment. Possibly expulsion.<br>
<br>
I sat in my office in complete shock. Where in the heck did he get this knife?!? I do not have any weapons of any kind in my home. Knifes, guns any of that stuff scares me.<br>
<br>
I got to the school and my son was in tears. He was so embarrassed and so upset. Another student had given him this knife and the office staff at the school did not believe him. The little girl (a 7 yo first grader also) who gave it to him said it wasn't hers. I was not satisfyied with that.<br>
<br>
After asking the girl again with me standing right there giving her the death look, she admitted to bringing it to school. She had taken it from her parents bedroom.<br>
<br>
Still, the school wanted to suspend my child. In no way was I about to let my 7 yo son be suspended and miss a day of learning. Being at school everyday is very important to me. Besides, the way the school handled it was punishment enough for both kids.<br>
<br>
I went back and forth with this Principal, asking her where the teachers were when this exchange happened. Are these teachers so overwhelmed in their classrooms to realize what is going on around them? Are they too underpaid to give a damn about the childrens safety? (There were alot of things said, but I don't have time to get into all of that, the end of the day is here!)<br>
<br>
Soon after our conversation began to get heated the little girls father showed up. He and I both thought that neither of the children should be suspended from school. Obviously, these are 7 yo kids who are still learning right from wrong. Each child should be punished but taking their education away is not the kind of punishment they needed and I wasn't about to let that happen.<br>
<br>
We made such a big stink about it and I wouldn't leave until I got my way (stubborn) that she finally gave in. Neither one of the students were suspended and I went home mentally worn out. (I logged onto EQ and killed some orcs. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
When my son and I got home I made him write an apology letter to his teacher. But in all honesty, the teacher should be writting an apology letter to us for not being attentive. Someone could have really gotten hurt and I blame the school for having ignorant teachers.<br>

<br>
Remember... Those who can't, teach. Those who can't teach, teach PE.<br>
<br>
P.S. Voilence caused by your children IS your fault.  Teachers are not there to teach your children morality, that's your job.  The teachers job is to teach them how to read, and count, NOT how to be a useful member of society.  Saying that what your child does while not under your direction supervision is not your fault, is a cop-out.  Jeez, take some responsibility in your life.<br>
<br>
If your 8 year-old son sneaks into your room while you are busy raiding HoT and takes your gun into your backyard and shoot the nextdoor neighbor, it's YOUR FAULT!  Grow a backbone.<br>

<br>
she said it was aggressive.  aggressiveness isnt wrong.  i pity the day that it becomes wrong. is this that day?<br>
<br>
she said it was violent.  it wasnt violent.  what the hell is violent bout playing cowboys and indians.  violent is NOT pointing your finger at someone and making a noise.  violent IS lowering your shoulder pads and trying to flatten the next kid into the turf.  yet the latter is standard after school development and the former is suspension?  football is violent. im not saying it isnt good. im just saying its fricken violent.<br>
<br>
whats next suspension for assault via two for flinching.  <br>
<br>
these activities dont have much to do with what they represent.  i mean cause those &quot;boys&quot; dont want to play with that &quot;girl&quot; are you going to suspend them for their clearly sexiest behavior.  YOU see the world in sexes.  YOU see the cowboys and indian as violent.  but the kids see neither.  its development. their minds are simplier.  stop complicated their damn world.  <br>
<br>
now the kid who got in trouble is being forced to see this play from an adults perspective.  thats never right.  thats sooo wrong.  i mean moving kids to maturity is fine by radical events that force kids to deal with adult points of view come out bad.  they arnt ready.  <br>
<br>
but thats what you have now. why do you think the kid was tearing?  cause now he has to deal with this whole new level of complexity befure the kid was ready.<br>
<br>
so wrong. so naive.  i mean clearly this teacher wouldnt show violent films to the students. yet she has just the same projected a violent context for the student to now understand.  . its just as bad.<br>
<br>
