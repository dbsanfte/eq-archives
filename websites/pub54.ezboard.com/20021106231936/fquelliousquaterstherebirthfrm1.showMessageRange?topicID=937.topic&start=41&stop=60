i have to invalidate any list that puts druids as the easiest or second easiest class to play.  i have to ask this: how come a wizard is harder to play then a druid?  hows that work?<br>
<br>
i notice most people have been putting their own class as hard to play.  hard is fricken ae snaring mobs in fear to pull kite agro after the enchanter has died.  hard is doing shit your class aint designed to do.  thats hard.  when you see a ranger save a fear raid cause of some freak train by acting quick on the kite thats skill cause rangers arnt designed for crowd control.  .  pull 3 level 57s with only druids on crowd control then tell me there aint no damn skill there.   <br>
<br>
i really dislike mez.  its no secret that i think eq would be alot more fun if mez/charm hadnt been invented.  it certainly would demand more skill. <br>
<br>
most all those classes get a vault in difficulty if you start picturing groups without a chanter/bard in it.  btw  why exactly does a necro on crowd control take less skill then an enchanter on crowd control? no answer... of course not cause everyone on this thread didnt realize that in addition to all their other roles a necro sometimes is mezzer via stuns.  how does that complexity not vault them ahead of chanters?  i could go down the list...<br>
<br>
im still shocked by druids the easiest class to play...<br>
<br>
and why for god sakes is a mage way way way harder to play then a shaman.  if its purely cuase mage soloing is harder then shaman soloing then i got to ask why the hell rogues arnt at the top. maybe its cause mages are harder to level to 60 then shamans.  is that really the distinction of hard to play?  bah mages arnt any harder or any easier to play then shamans. really to dispute that i have to get an answer to whats so hard bout playing (not being) a mage.  <br>
<br>
this whole conversation is biased against 3 classes. warriors/monks/rogues.  monks get a vault cause of pulling.  warriors get a vault cause of... what the heck is hard bout being a warrior? oh ya when to hit ae taunt. and rogues get a vault cause of if you fall early in a hard fight it hurts bad for the raid.   the last thing you want to hear 12 seconds into a trak fight that you brought &quot;just enough for&quot; (just enough being dependant on your friends) is the rogue saying &quot;died sorry&quot;   i know cause i did it.   and you know what happened?  we died. we all died....  sure theres nothing hard bout being a rogue. less a raids expecting you to kill the mob and the mob is killing back *stares at the enchanter* the most intense moments for a rogue come when a mob has almost beat your raid and your still alive.  then its a dance.  its a raid saving dance of aggression versus caution.<br>

<br>
I HAVE played a druid.  I have played every class to just about 30 (or more), with the exception of BST.  The toughest thing about playing a druid in a group, is NOT DOT'ing everything.  <br>
<br>
whats so hard about being a warrior? Heh, what is so hard about casting panic animal?  It is ALL relative.<br>
<br>
*I* think druids are the easiest class to play, but that is just me.  *YOU* may have a different opinion.  Go figure.<br>
<br>
and umm... *I* listed bards and chanters as the hardest, yet I do not play either of them (not really to my liking).  My main is a Cleric, my second main is a Warr, my upcoming 3rd is a Wizz..<br>
<br>
Personally, I like casters alot more than meelee, but sometimes I am in the mood to beat something down like a red-headed step-child, eh?, or get beat down <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=198804>Impudent Blasphemy</a><BR>

Why are warriors tough to play you ask?<br>
<br>
If you have to ask than I guess you've never been main assist on any ToV/Kael/various_dragon01 raid.  It is the main tank that CAN mean victory or defeat.<br>
<br>
Montyy summed it up fairly well when not doing MA, a warriors role is fairly simple.  Slap on a 2h weapon and help push in the right direction.  HOWEVER, doing MA is not quite so simple.  Aggro management is NOT easy when you WANT mob-x to be hitting you.  It's a lot easier to gain aggro when you don't want it.  Mob positioning is also as vital.  Positioning mob-x so that it doesn't warp into a wall or fall down into lava/water and start summoning random raiders.  Aggro/positioning is everyone's responsibility but guess who hears the brunt of the argument when things go bad....warriors.<br>
<br>
I have played every class out there at some point or another, but not necessarily high enough to know the advantages/disadvantages of each, but enough to know my own limitations of the class and if I could play it well.  Kudos to you out there that CAN play bards, paladins, enchanters and necros.  There is no &quot;list&quot; that can be made up of easiest to difficult classes because it's not the class, it's the person weilding the class.  In a sense, these avatars are merely puppets.  I play a warrior and I play it well.  There is nothing more I can say.  If you don't believe me, come group with me sometime and I'll show you.  I don't claim to know how to play a shaman in the high end game, nor cleric, monk, etc...because that's not the class I've invested my time, energy and thought into for 3 years.<br>

<br>
Basically the way I see it the most difficult 2 jobs in a raid are 1) the MT and 2) the people keeping the MT alive.  Basically if they do thier job, all the rest have to do is not screw up and you're going to win 9 times outta 10.<br>
<br>
But like I said before the clerics have the hardest job hands down IMO, since they have the least room for error of any class.<br>

(and play well)</span><hr size=1> i thought bout this issue on the way to work and came to something i feel is self evident.<br>
<br>
by common sense most people in a classification are average for that classification.  yet most anyone thats been 60 for a month thinks they play their class exceptionally.   I guess thats a game doing its job. games generally make you feel exceptional if you dont dig to deep. <br>
<br>
 something can be learned by considering the specific case of level 60 enchanters.  every level 60 enchanter i ever met thought they were exceptional: gods gift to mezzing.  yet i can tell you cause im not an enchanter having grouped with many that most are adequate and average for a level 60 enchanter.  rarely like 5% of the time i meet a new level 60 enchanter that will impress me.  yet all level 60 enchanters i ever meet think they are impressive.  in reality they are average.  <br>
<br>
BUT this really sheds some light on what we think it means to be a hard class to play.  it has little to do with percentile measurement of skill relative to your peers but instead a hard class is a statement of how much time it takes to get up to speed to be merely adequate.   Specifically again all level 60 enchanters are fairly impressive when compared to their level 40 counter parts.  They have lots of practice and thats the statement of hard  the amount of practice it takes to be adequate.<br>
<br>
<br>
So which classes take the most practice to be adequate groupers?  Difficult to say but some &quot;blocking&quot; is clearly justified.<br>
you can basically block the stun/mez crowd control guys.  bard,chanters, necros as being somewhat equal in difficulty of getting up to speed.<br>
<br>
then you can block the wizard/druids neither of those 2 can get much apart from the other.<br>
<br>
then you can block the spellless rogues/monks/warriors as being roughly equal to get up to speed.<br>
<br>
then you can block the hybrids as having the roughly same need for practice.<br>
<br>
i dont know if its fair to block shamans with mages as a shamans life is much more complicated.  mage pets may do more damage but a shaman still uses a pet and therefor has as much complication as a mage + the whole disease versus magic slow/malo cano/torpor complexity.  it would take a bit longer to get strong with that extra complexity.<br>
<br>
warriors/monks/rogues complexity is domiinated by the momentum. their complexity comes specifically because they have no exceptional options.  in the first 5 seconds you have to figure out how to apply your momentum as you have no way to change it 30 seconds in atleast not instantly.  but all of that really doesnt get noticed cause it actually doesnt take much practice to be adequate.<br>
<br>
edit:<br>
clerics are dominated by attentiveness.  an attentive cleric is usually tagged skillful an unattentive cleric is tagged skillless. a cleric might object that their are big difference in their relative mana efficiencies but this doesnt come under the tag adequate.  its like the little things a rogue with a 130 days played does to make an encounter work: those things go unnoticed by most a subtle secret of the character in question usually passed off as a &quot;good nite.&quot;  as long as a cleric keeps people topped off and chs in time to keep people alive they will look gtg nm the reality.<br>

I think its not so much skill in playing a class as it is training and practice.  Most of us start out really lousy as a class we play and learn from our mistakes and people teaching us how to play.<br>
<br>
Most people can play any class decently given enough time to learn and practice. <p><center>

(and play well)</span><hr size=1> Gaethan theres tricks to getting aggro.  Like I said not everyone has AE tuant or EB weapons.  For the most part you gotta get right up on the mob and taunt like a mofo, therefore generating taunt hate, as well as proximity hate.  When you do this you still need to be aware of the mob placement (for rogue and ranger DPS) as well as your own placement in regards to the clerics so as not to be OOR for heals.  Add in annoying Mob AE abilities like stuns and knockbacks and you need to be even more careful.<br>
<br>
Not saying any of this is incredibly hard, but in regards to the rest of the melee's roles its alot since all others for the most part just have to worry about hitting the damn thing and nothing else.<br>
<br>
And I agree that Druids are much harder to play in a raid setting than a wizzie (although in a group setting I'd venture to say they are about the same) since all wizzies have to do is NOT over nuke....which most of you cant seem to accomplish <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Druids are the primary back up healers for not only the MT but for basically all the casters that get aggro....*cough* overnuking wizzies *cough*  Added with the DOT stacking, druids also play a big role in rad DPS now as well.<br>

Wizards role on a raid is probably in the top 4 easiest but that doesnt mean it is easiest to do.. Overnuking wizards hmm?  if it was so easy to play a raid wizard there would be no overnuking wizards right?<br>
<br>
If i started a warrior and leveled him up on groups then got some raid experience I bet I could become a good warrior.. If i tricked Montyy into letting me play Montyy for a day.. I'd bet Id' do pretty lousy because I wouldn't have the experience or knowledge.<br>
<br>
Besides Enchanters and bards there really is no tough classes to play.. Each of them you have to experience their play and learn how to play one but I believe anyone can play them. <p><center>

<br>
But in situations when a group/raid takes full advantage of the capabilities of a good druid, then they are far more difficult to play.  I recently spent half a day in an Emperor group in Seb.  We had no chanter, so I had responsiblity for crowd control.  I also split responsibility for healing with the shaman.  I also needed to do reasonable DPS since we had 3 melee.  I spent the whole time busting my ass to park mobs - sometimes 2 at a time, DoT mobs, heal the tanks, and finish if I had the mana.<br>
<br>
Yeah, that was a piece of cake.<br>

(and play well)</span><hr size=1> Qutsemni (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) made some good points.  I know as a cleric  rarely if ever grouped with any other clerics in an exp situation.  Raids and EXP grouping are two entirely different things and take two entirely different mindsets for a cleric.  I imagine it is probably very similiar for an Enchanter.  Because of that it is very difficult to gauge ones &quot;skill&quot; or lack therof because there is no benchmark from which to grade yourself.  That's probably why most enchanters think they are great...God I agree with that SOOOO much...Most clerics think the are the best too...because they don't ever group with others of their class.  Also, and this is a fuggin fact, the skill level of most characters is often judged by horney pimply faced fucks that are just dreamin of throwin some bologna at the ass of the Dark Elf Cleric/Enchanter in their group.  Therefore people that play female characters of specefic races often are deemed to be &quot;great&quot; at their class regardless of how good they really are.  I've seen this happen a fuggin lot.<br>
<br>
In conclusion I just want to say if you want to be &quot;Skillful&quot; at your class make a female elven variety ( doesn't really matter which although the Dark Elves are en vogue these days) and buy a case of Red Bull.  You'll be the best.<br>

<br>
If you think botting a cleric and tossing a CH on every few seconds is what clerics do, then I can see why you would disagree.  Just as you would think warriors do nothing more then hit the attack button and they are &quot;good&quot; if they remembered that taunt needs to be trained.  Druids?  Well, sure, druids are the easiest class if you know absolutely nothing about what they actually do.  <br>
<br>
clerics are hardest to play well, because we are always charged with healing everyone, from the ranger and wizard that can't manage aggro to the warrior that is dutifully tanking away (That is when teh pally or SK don't decide they are bored and start taunting).<br>
<br>
Not only are we always charged with the above, but we are in charge of camping out if evac is not an option and the situation calls for it.  We are in charge of deciding that the ranger is going to die and the chanter is going to live.<br>
<br>
When a cleric is really good, they will also participate in crowd control, chanter support (through stuns and roots), mana managment with buffs and heals, and making decisions about the mana efficiency of nukes, heals, stuns or roots.  All against mobs that have beefed up MR and we have no MR debuffers of our own.<br>
<br>
I am not saying that I am the &quot;well played cleric&quot; but I am saying that they are damn hard to play well (although, remarkably easy to bot.  but, you get what you pay for).<br>
