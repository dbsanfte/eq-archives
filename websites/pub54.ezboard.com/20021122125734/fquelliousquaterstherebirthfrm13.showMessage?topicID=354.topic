<br>
So here is my story of friday before last:  <br>
<br>
It was 3am, I was ready for bed - my brain was numb - my eyes hung heavy.  Fuelled on several pints of the finest quality ale, my body said you have a little juice in you.  Get a port to EC, sort yourself out some arrows and get to a portal for tommorrows journeys.  <br>
<br>
So I was running through WL and I saw this clothed corpse.  Being the Samaritan (and not overly busy person) I was at the time, I stopped at the corpse and /who all XXXX.  <br>
<br>
Was online, so I asked them for a consent and said I would drag their corpse to Kael cos I saw a cleric with a rez stick in Kael zone.<br>
<br>
No reply....<br>
<br>
Fair enough, I ran to portal and waited for a wizard/druid to come past to I could snag a port on their way past.  <br>
<br>
I then got a tell in 5 mins, saying &quot;sure&quot; and got a consent.  <br>
<br>
I went looking for the corpse again and found it, dragged it to kael, zoned in saw the cleric - explained to them what I was doing (and got no reply).  I sent a tell to XXXX(now identified as a wizarD) advising them that the clerics name was XXXX  <br>
and that he should send them a tell re: rezzing of corpse.  <br>
<br>
I then went running back up to WL portal sat down and waited.  <br>
<br>
I then got another tell from the wizard saying my corpse wants to be at POG zone and not Kael.  <br>
<br>
/sigh <br>
<br>
I reply OK and run back to Kael get the corpse, get lost massively looking at the wrong locs get HT'd a couple of times and am left at 20% hps by the time I get to PoG.  <br>
<br>
There was a raid force outside PoG, so I ask them to a) please heal me if possible and b) rez this stranger wizard - I get ignored / everyone zones in. <br>
<br>
I ask the wizard (whom I had establish to be quite ignorant/ rude by now) to speak with the people who he was raiding with because his corpse was outside PoG.  <br>
<br>
Luckily a passing druid hit me with a heal and a wizard come up.  <br>
<br>
Having enough of this wizard corpse and dragging it all over WL (at 3:30am by now) I decided to select the newly appeared wizard %T and humbly ask for a port.  <br>
<br>
BAD MOVE NUMBER 1 !!!!!<br>
<br>
Zoned into PoG instead ... 50% hps no sow no invis.  <br>
<br>
So one of those invis mobs immediately starts pounding on me.  Frantically, I search through my backpacks and find the insta gate potion I never really wanted to use. <br>
<br>
BAD MOVE NUMBER 2 !!!!!<br>
<br>
*cough* The overthere gate potion<br>
<br>
Clickity click.  <br>
<br>
LOADING PLEASE WAIT.....<br>
<br>
I appeared in the hull of a ship 20% hps, totally clueless of my surroundings .. and was immediately set upon by a bunch of skeletons.  <br>
<br>
I luckily dispatched of these and was sat in the hull of this unknown ship at 3:45am (without even receiving a single thanks from the wizard who I had helped) using a pitiful 90hp heal to build myself up.  <br>
<br>
The only POSITIVE that I pulled from this situation was I was in a ship, ship means water - water means no guards...<br>
<br>
So after 20 mins or so healing I poked my head out from the hull of this ship and was on a beach.  Goody Goody... ! <br>
<br>
I jumped in the water and swam my ass off so far down the coast that I would have been hitting Kaladim more than I would have run into the Outpost of Guards.<br>
<br>
Moral of this story:  <br>
<br>
Winners dont use drugs <br>
