Aye, it does take time to mem a spell, cast it, and regain mana.  Aye, one should be considerate and not bother people who are busy and want to just play the game.  Aye, we all have expenses.  But if you are sitting there waiting for Nexus portal to open, it really isn't going out of your way to SoW, buff, or C2 someone.   Demanding high amount of money to port some poor stranded tank who would have to run through several zones without SoW or invis or wait for Tribunal knows how long for boat also seems... hmmm, I can't think of the right word... uncaring?  If you are going out of your way to help me especially if you don't know me, then I of course feel obligated to offer you something if I can.  <br>
<br>
I rarely if ever have plat on me but I have found that if I carry portal fragments, peridots, potions, idols, and/or stat increasing food with me that I can usually repay someone's kindness for giving me a rez, Xloc, summons, or port with something they need.  A thank you and some cookies makes me feel like less of a beggar too. <p><a href="http://216.118.107.63/SIGS/juror.jpg" target="_blank">

<br>
I dont generally refuse people TL's. I like to be compensated for my time because to be perfectly honest, it does slow me down. Since when do you ever, ever, just sit at seb zone if your lfg? Bollux to that, you solo mobs while you wait.<br>
<br>
You also have how much time online in a week? 5pm - midnight X5 + weekends of 12hours? thats over 50 hours a week. Sure, i can handle a few xlocs every once in a while if i could play that much.<br>
<br>
But i cant, i try to be nice, and people take advantage. Everyone thinks its my duty to port them, like i have made this char to TL people to help their EQ experience. If i have 20 xlocs over the course of a few hours, ive lost 25pp in fragments (not THAT bad), about 15mins or more porting to Nek Forest and running to Temple to get more fragments (thats the major pain). In return for this time and money, i recieve a thanks (if im lucky) and a request next time they see me online for another TL! Paying me makes it slightly more beneficial (i still need things even if you dont), but not overly. But its still a case of &quot;Geez, cant people leave me alone for just a few hours&quot;<br>
<br>
I guess you're gonna keep on saying 'well its only 20 seconds and if you cant spare the time then your just pathetic'... but after the umpteenth tell from randomcharacter007: Hi friend, can you TL me? it gets a bit much. Im glad some wizzies have more patience than i do.<br>
<br>
On a final note - politeness gets you SO SO far. Last weekend the first thing that happened when i logged on (in DL) was someone politely asked me for a TL. Something along the lines of 'excuse me, would it be possible to get a TL to WC if you're not to busy?' I typed /rtarget and she was next to me, so i TLed her, free of charge. That way isnt an inconvenience, asking for a TL when u cant see me is.<br>

Know druids well and even just 40 guildees can start to seem like a freakin chore.   Its a serious time commitment just being commited to porting your guildees and aquantinces thats the backdrop when that boat riding newbie needs a port.  Add in every odd monk that thinks you should port them for free...  Hell i walked cross the continent more then once pre 25.  Its part of the game really.  So what if you cant help that poor level 10 get to his l33t exp ground dude. Fookers i did levels 1 through 10 in nek forest in feb 2000. cry me a damn river for the worst newbie ground.  i did it cause info then sucked ass. i had to figure out where to level via stinking word of mouth. As for everyone else.  sorry you got to pay the druids its just too time consuming in the long run doing free ports.  As for druids should be generous?  <br>
<br>
There is _ALWAYS_ two sides to generosity.   Anyone with a JINGLE in their pocket cant play the &quot;you should be generous&quot; card.  this applies to most things really.  Yar its free mana right? doesnt cost the player anything right?   HELLO ITS PLAT PIXELS....  what the hell does a pp cost the player REALLY?  their both numbers in a game engine.  mana doesnt cost anyone anything but PP cost you ____.  The answer is they both cost you time.<br>
<br>
Sometimes no... cases like sow etc.  i aint paying for a damn sow. or if i do do you really want 2 gold coins?  =) <br>
<br>
there is an underlying issue of be greatful cause someone helped your ass.  course i wouldnt take pp for binding someones wounds that would take away from i helped your ass thunder.  guess being greatful doesnt need to translate to pp in my book.   its bout remembering them perhaps.<br>
<br>
As for wizards same deal less you walk up next to them. if your next to them i go:<br>
/tt hey can you please xloc me to wc for a stack of portal frags.<br>
<br>
if their to busy /shrug. i go to the pp frags xloc ooc.<br>
<br>
notice the stack of portal frags...  it seems uncaring to ask someone to xloc you and not give them portal frags... yet 95% of you guys do?  Then moan cause wizzes are to lazy to port ya?  come on.  go get some damn portal frags. ya its work thats the point.  there should be 40 on ya and a 100 in the bank.  <br>

As the guilds grow and mature, conflicts arise, growing pains if you will. I think it's sometimes hard to remember life as a youngin' and we play a bit more hard ball in general. <br>
<br>
There seem to be a lot more newbies begging for stuff, and really having no clue. To keep that in perspective though, maybe they were always there, I just a) had nothing they needed and b) didn't know enough myself to realize they knew even less than me. <br>
<br>
I came from Vazaelle way back when and have never regretted it. I started in Everfrost, and was treated very well. I never asked for anything other than maybe a sow until level 9, but I was the beneficiary of many buffs and trinkets that probably didn't mean as much to my benefactors as they did me. I used my Runed Totem Staff for around 15 levels <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There will probably always be those who mooch, but the kindness that was shown to me in a very tough newbie zone has made me the player I am today. I try to give back to those I think really need my help, and I hope one day, they continue the circle. <br>
<br>
Quellious is a good server, with a lot of talented players and good people. We are far from perfect, but I think in small ways, all of us are trying to do better. Each time we avoid senseless conflicts such as those brought to the boards, we are one step closer to realizing our potential as a community and not just a server.<br>

Those who can't port should be respectful and polite to those who can port.  <br>

All I am asking is that you see someone who could really use a hand and you have a little time that you consider giving him or her a lift, especially in a remote location.  I don't expect you to do it for free either.  <br>

I feel sorry for the poor shmuck who came out to Sebilis because someone told him it would be a good place to find a group then has to sit there for a couple hours or who dies trying to run back to DL because he doesn't have 100pp for a ride home.

Seriously peeps,  buy yourself a 10-slot back, and fill the mother f'er with PORTAL FRAGMENTS, PERIDOTS, BAT WINGS, PEARLS and some extra fish rolls and fuzzlecutter formula.  Trust me, these go a LONG way when asking for rez, sow whatever.<br>

<br>
SO people get bored and sell their characters or sometimes give them away, and you get 'new' people coming in that don't know the game and have no sense of community, they usually leave their current guild and try to guildhop. Fail to get into the big leagues because they know crap.(usually fail but I know exceptions) Then having hit the glass ceiling like their predecessor they move on too. But not before getting bitter and pissing a few people off on the way, and generally making Quellious a lesser place.<br>
<br>
Eventually EQ2 will come out or some other game that competes well and everyone will leave but the people who are actually getting to see all the content they want, and it'll be fine. No one will be bitter.<br>
<br>
The problem isn't the guilds. Or the people. If getting your epic was a challenge for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or your guild it would be different.<br>
<br>
But things like Ragefire can do nothing BUT cause animosity. This game should NOT pit players against players in this fashion, it ruins the game. It ruins the community. It takes the fun out of it and turns toons into unskilled and uncivilized  dopplegangers of themselves. (when they quit and someone else gets the account)<br>
<br>
Impossible you say? Not at all. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> One</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> solution would be for epic fights to be 'cage of death' type fights. You do a turn in now you and your group (who must be your level or lower)are in a fight alone with the mob that can have no interference form anyone else. You fail you start over and try again maybe in a level or two. Then if you see a lvl 52 with an epic it MEANS something. Anyway that's just one idea, I am sure if I spent an hour I could think of a half dozen more, but the current system of pitting people against people in THIS manner is very very destructive to the game.<br>
<br>
I'd rather FIGHT other people literally for something than the way it is. At least there would be a real conflict you could get your teeth into. Strip the clerics naked, give them summonned gear, and let them pvp for the damn thing would be BETTER than what happens now.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my .02cp<br>

<br>
As for everyone else, its not a big deal, I've played the melee end of the stick and it sucks getting from place to place without sow or a port. Someone asks me for SoW especially, its usually not an issue to give it to them unless they're a prick to me. Its a level 15 spell and costs dirt to cast, i can regen that sitting down and back up real quick lol.<br>
<br>
Ports are a little different though, several times I've told people who insisted to get bent. Look, I'm where I am because I want to, and if you INSIST that the reason for my class is to port your monkey a$$, then you're walking pal. Some ports are inconvenient but hey, you HAVE to help someone out if they're stuck there. I've ported several people this week out of Plane of Growth and ToV (bad faction, or no sense of direction), real annoying to get back to (face it, I'm not screwing my Nexus bind point for this), but I mean come on...think of how they feel being stranded.<br>

Regarding the Actual Thread....<br>
I have been playing on Quell for about 18 months, I know a few people but not many (damn stupid timezone), and lurked here for a while. But on the whole, I have found Quellious it be a good server, with a great (if not slightly insane) community of folks, both those that I know, and thoughs that I don't but have read of their antics here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Yes there are a few bad apples, but when you get a few thousand people together, I guess you expect that. Heck look at me 18 months on Quellious, know almost no one. Damn I am an anti-social bastard. :P<br>
<br>
And the hijacking TL thing?<br>
Don't care I run everywhere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
