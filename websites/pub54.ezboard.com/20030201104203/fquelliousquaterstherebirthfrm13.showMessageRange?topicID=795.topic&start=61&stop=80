Heres what you can do</span><hr size=1> Actually the only paranoia I suffer from Wyen is people with your opinions ever make it into office. I might as well put a gun to my head and save myself. Seems alot of people that are against any action are the type that still feel the U.S. is invincible and should wouldnt worry about whats going on in other countries cuz it dont affect them &quot;yet&quot;. 9-11 should be more than enough to make you feel otherwise. Does it need to be little to late for us to react? Do you need the mass loss of life for it to warrant a reaction? I myself prefer to have it stopped before its used, seems like common sense to me. As I asked since you dont think its a &quot;necessary evil&quot; at this moment. What will it take for you to accept some kind of action taken? The nukes actually being used? Or knowing that he has nuke capability but hasnt used it? Cuz we sure know you dont agree with us taking any kind of action of stopping him before he even gets that capability. Me and quite bit of the nation agree with whats going on and what the government is deciding to do, thank God. <br>
<br>
And yes I attacked you and your posting that link. I find your post hugely insulting and that link even worse. Guess what, im entitled to my opinion just like your entitled to yours. I just dont use mine to attack my government, wait I take that back come tax season I might have a few unkind words to say about the government. But stealing your word of the day,taxes are a neccessary evil. Knowing your a college student actually explains alot right now. Talk about the biggest source of P.C. garbage look to your college campus. What dont they protest on a college campus? If your breathing wrong youll have a petition with 100 signatures shoved down your throat.<br>
<br>
Agreeing with Salta here, I do have faith in the government and tho they have been shady on other aspects. I can assure myself that we arent being misguided by them on whats going on with Iraq.  The conspiracy theory is used all the time, guilt by association. The Bush family made their wealth on Oil, so hence they must be after the oil for their own personal reasons and the U.S. is just a pawn for them to get that. RIIIIIGHT. If anyone actually believes in that you really do lack faith in the government. I see the use of intimadation being used alot here. I personally dont feel our actions are ment to intimidate other countrys. They should set an example and a message. One that North Korea should be well aware of. And for those that are saying we are ignoring whats going on in North Korea, are you living in a hole in the ground with no outside contact? I picked up the paper here, the front page and the first couple pages there after were about what the U.S. was doing in North Korea. Yeaaaaa sure looks like we are ignoring whats going on in North Korea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :bad --><img src=http://www.quellious-collective.com/emoticons/bad.gif ALT=":bad"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
Lastly as one of the previous posters said. If theres one country the U.S. has monitored its Iraq. I myself feel positive enough that the U.S. knows whats going on, if we are taking this kind of stance theres something going on that shouldnt be. Just because the &quot;proof&quot; hasnt been publicly released doesnt mean it isnt there. The people who need to know, do know, and they let us know as much as they can. This should be no suprise on how left out the public is on situtations like this for obvious reasons. So im heading back off to my closed minded world where I enjoy living, thanks Wyen for making that so clear now I can live in harmony till we get overrun with flower power in the government offices. Long live Flower Power<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :moon --><img src=http://www.quellious-collective.com/emoticons/moon.gif ALT=":moon"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
&quot;Vat I *REFUSE* to stand by and do nothing while innocent lives are tossed in the gutter because of heresay. Yup, thats all 'I heard it from this guy who knows this guy who knows that guy' is until its said by our leadership.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Just read Wyens recent response. Lol your that gullible to think this is all started because of heresay? Haha before you go calling me close minded you better look at yourself. What about the vast amount of innocent lives Saddam has already taken and continues to take? They arent important? They dont count? Whats your response there? Ahh let me assume, maybe American lives are the only ones that count. <br>
<br>
&quot;Zolina (I think said this, might be wrong) - The alternatives. IMO do the exact same thing without the military buildup. There should be no war. For the moment, there is no call for a war. The only thing *I* want done is for there not to be an unjust war due to this situation being handled badly from the start. Let weapon inspectors do their jobs, keep a tight enough grip on Saddam to where they comply, but don't go around making the international community think you are just going to go off on your own and start a war without the UNs blessing. Don't use friggin scare tactics on our allies. <br>
<br>
Theres your easy easy EASY solution. &quot;<br>
<br>
Thanks Wyen, you have figured out what alot of well informed,educated, and experienced people in the government could not. If I were you id start campaigning for President for the next term. Your a man with all the answers. Btw, if the U.S. was tossing their weight around like you imply and ignoring the U.N., Im sure the U.S. would already be over there doing what needs to be done and will eventually be done, no thanks to you and your petitioners.<br>

<br>
You think Saddam's going to pay any attention to the UN when there aren't 150,000 US soldiers breathing down his neck?  And why haven't the UN inspectors started searching those endless miles of underground tunnels yet?  According to US intelligence, Saddam has made his germ and gas weapon facilities COMPACT and MOBILE.  He could have fully-functioning factories set up in cellars, garages, or underground storage facilities that the UN would never find if they searched for 50 years.  And the Iraqi scientists aren't going to rat on him because Saddam is very good at killing rats.<br>
<br>
In short, Saddam's up to no good and the inspectors alone aren't going to stop him.  We need to overthrow him now, before he starts smuggling his goodies to terrorists (if he hasn't already started).<br>

Bush calling Iraq, Iran and N. Korea &quot;evil&quot; has nothing to do with Americas perception either.<br>
<br>
I can completely understand why someone who was involved in the Gulf war could have your views, Droz. Just I don't get how anyone could generalize the way you have. Your views are based on complete paranoia. &quot;What if&quot; situations just aren't good enough for me. Yes, I am very aware of what Saddam has done in the past. They are atrocities. But we have seen NO EVIDENCE that he is linked to any terrorist organization, just heard that he &quot;could&quot; be. We generalize the terror that came from 9/11 with the small threat of Iraq and blow it into a fullscale ground war. Fight the war on terror by fighting the terrorists..not people who might kinda sorta almost maybe supply the terrorists with weapons they might kinda sorta almost maybe have. <br>
<br>
Call me ignorant, call me a hippie, fine. Your public denouncing of me won't make a damn difference in how I view things (while some of the opposition who have given good points in fact, have). <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
The first meeting, according to intelligence sources, occurred in the Sudan in 1994 when bin Laden received an Iraqi delegation led by Iraq intelligence chief Faruq Hijazi. <br>

Heres another quote from a different story on CNN:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A former army officer now under the protection of the anti-Saddam Iraqi National Congress has repeated to numerous U.S. officials and reporters his tale of a camp at Salman Pak, just outside Baghdad, run by the Iraqi secret police as a training school for potential terrorists from across the Arab world. Among other things, he said, the camp uses the fuselage of a Boeing 707 to practice hijackings. Early this year Mohamed Mansour Shahab, a mercenary now in Kurdish custody who says he worked for Saddam's secret police, told interviewers that in 2000 the regime set aside $16 million for nine terrorist operations, including a scuttled suicide attack Shahab was supposed to organize against a U.S. Navy ship in the Persian Gulf.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

we assumed we had failed after 9/11 when examined i think we were successful in the big picture with the way we were handling ourselves. <br>
<br>
sure we have lessons.  sure we need to punish. but this top down sense of failure is inappropriate.  its led to sweeping mistakes in my opinion.  its lead to incorrect valuations of what has worked before.   its allowed radical ideologies to creep into mainstream american politics in subtle ways. <br>

So many people want to drop &quot;smart bombs&quot; on all the people we don't see eye to eye with.  This ain't right... we are becoming Nazi Germany. <br>
<br>
What did we go to war over in 1991?  Iraq invaded Kuwaitt, we sold the story it was to police the world for the UN. The real story was Saudi Arabia, and Kuwaitt is where the US gets its oil.  <br>
<br>
12 year later, what story are we selling the world?  Take out Saddem's weapons of mass destruction.  Real reason... same as the first time... oil economics.  <br>
<br>
We medal in other people business... i.e. CIA and what not... in the region because we need oil.  We created Iraq in the 1970's/80's.  We arm Iraq to kill Iran, Iran takes hosteges, we send weapons to Iran for hosteges. You think Iran is gonna loveus for arming thier enemy, and vice versa.  If we didn't need the oil we wouldn't have medaled in middle east affairs, and we wouldn't be on the shit list with them and being a medalling, shit stirring bully. <br>
<br>
What is America? Its a Capitalistic society... &quot;money talks and bullshit walks.&quot;  If we didnt put money in the middle east for oil we they would still be in the dark ages shit'n in pots and reading the kuran by candle-light.<br>
<br>
Case in Point:<br>
Notice, how we handle North Korea... No war, talks... why... they got nothing worth nothing and need our help.  They actually have the means to make weapons of mass destruction, and I am sure china can help out with the delivery system.  <br>
<br>
Notice, how we handled Yugoslavia... we did very little because again.. they got nothing worth nothing.  Complete genocide going on... and we didnt give a shit until we got flooded with photos of the mangles kids.  How long did that go on before we did anything.<br>
<br>
Notice, India and Pakastan... they both have nukes and ready to e-radiate the region in kasmir. and create nuclear winter in western China.  What do we do? barely anything.  Hear, talk to Colon. We aren't sending troops there.<br>
<br>
Afganistan, the only reason we did anything here is because the american people were pissed that thier sense security vanished. We are no longer sheltered from what happens in Isreal.  AND innocent people killed, but a foreign source.  If it would have been TImothy McVie, we wouldn't send a smart bomb into his mom's house killing his family and neighbors. <br>
<br>
To say this war is about weapons of mass destruction isnt total bullshit... but its at least goat shit thats for sure... nothing gets the Repulican War machine moving faster than the US dollar bill.   <br>
<br>
The weapons of mass destruction is a side note selling point to cloud the vision of people who would like to send someone else's son, or brother, or father oversea's to get shot at.  They'd be better off admitting oil, and the fact that Iraq switched to the Euro has somethign to do with it.  Instead of feeding us part truthes.<br>
<br>
I agree Saddam needs to die... but the brain washed Iraqi people don't... what if the tables where turned... what if they were the super power with smart bombs flying in your window and killing your mothers, brothers... children... you'd be doing the same shit.  <br>
<br>
I am not afraid to go to war over something I believe in, but I don't believe in the reasons we are going to war there.  Yeah we need to do something about Saddam I agree, but bombing inocent people is not a solution for me.<br>
<br>
Next, you have to ask... when will it stop?  Who's next?  Iran? Yemen? Lybia? Every muslim country? Everyone who don't see eye to eye with us.  Any who sells oil? <br>
<br>
Doh.... *end rant*  Wonder if anyone will read this... laff... I wouldn't.  <br>

People like that used to be called traitors, now they're hailed as enlightened freaking intellectuals. <p>Zolina the Wind Caller, Forest Stalker of Healers United, Quellious<br>
