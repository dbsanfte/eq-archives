<font size=4><B>Because you asked for it:</B></font>

<UL>
<LI><font size=+1>Q:&nbsp;When will there be a <CITE>System Shock&nbsp;2/Ultima Underworld&nbsp;3</CITE>?
</font><LI>A:&nbsp;Now it can be told!  Looking Glass Studios has signed
a publishing deal with <A HREF="http://www.ea.com/">Electronic Arts</A>
which includes the rights to publish <CITE>System Shock&nbsp;2</CITE>!
Rob "Xemu" Fermier of <CITE>System Shock&nbsp;1</CITE> fame is heading
up the project, which is already in production and will be shipping
some time in 1999.  Watch <A HREF="http://www.lglass.com/">LG's&nbsp;web site</A>
for more information.
<P>
<CITE>Ultima Underworld&nbsp;3</CITE> plays no part in this agreement.
<a target="new" href="http://www.origin.ea.com/">Origin Systems</a>
may or may not have their own plans for such a title. 
So, hey, ask Lord British.
<BR><BR>

<LI><font size=+1>Q:&nbsp;No, really, I heard you were working on a "<CITE>Quake</CITE> clone."  What's the
game going to play like?
</font><LI>A:&nbsp;Funny, I heard that <CITE>System Shock</CITE> was a "<CITE>Doom</CITE> clone"
back when it came out.  Not too many people say that these days, though.
<P>
Remember playing "cops and robbers?"  It's just like that.  You're the robber.
Only there's also magic potions; magic arrows; traps, locks, and security systems;
wierd monsters sometimes instead of cops; and a whole storyline where the robber
gets in over his head and has to (surprise, surprise) save the world.  
You can shoot out the lights, create diversions, and pickpocket the cops.
You can jump, fight,
and climb around, and if you get hurt doing it your Mom doesn't get mad.
<P>
That's what we mean when we say it's an "Action/Adventure" game.  Sorry, no experience
points, at least not in this one.
<BR><BR>

<LI><font size=+1>Q: Will <CITE>Thief</CITE> have 3D accelerator hardware support?
</font><LI>A: Yes.  Most of the questions have been specifically about the
<a href="http://www.3dfx.com/">3Dfx</a> hardware, which is clearly the
current industry leader in this regard.  We've got <CITE>Thief</CITE>
working under Direct3D now, which you can see in many of our
<A HREF="vision.html">screenshots</A>.
<BR><BR>

<LI><font size=+1>Q:&nbsp;Do you guys need any beta testers?  Like, say, me?
</font><LI>A:&nbsp;Not yet.  Also, be aware, we generally use only on-site playtesters 
for games of this sort, so you'd better either be in the Boston area, or be
pretty hot stuff, or both.  With endless access to nerdy, clever
<A HREF="http://web.mit.edu">MIT</A> students (and I can say that because I
used to be one of them), why go anywhere else?
<BR><BR>

<LI><font size=+1>Q: I can't wait!  When are you shipping?
</font><LI>A: Our current schedule puts it this fall.
I hope I was allowed to say that.  Like all schedules in this business, take it with a grain
of <a href="http://www.mortonintl.com/salt/oversalt.htm">salt</A>.  But we really,
really, are committed to a focused effort to ship with a Christmas-season goal,
which doesn't mean November&nbsp;20th, either.  We feel your pain, and we'll work real
hard, okay?
