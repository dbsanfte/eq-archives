<blockquote>
We're role-playing gamers, fantasy/sci-fi fans, and computer game
developers.  We play all the <A HREF="samegame.html">same games</A>
you do, and we know as well as you do that "Computer Role-Playing Game" is a
contradiction in terms.  
<P>
Sitting around the table at a gaming "run" is a social activity and an
exercise in imagination.  Players express their imaginations through their
social interactions and their creative approach to the problems of an
adventure.  The problem with the whole notion of the "computer
role-playing game" is that this cannot happen the same way in a computer
game. The social interaction which can be offered by a computer is pretty
hollow, and most games don't provide a whole lot to replace it.  The
tedious mazes of pre-scripted menu options that some games (including
our own!) have tried to pass off as "conversations" certainly don't cut
it.
<P>
This probably sounds like we don't think role-playing can work on
computers, but we do.  It's a hard <A HREF="howdo.html">technical and design problem</A>,
but we like hard problems or we wouldn't be in this business.  What many games
have done, which isn't hard, is to copy the forms of a paper role-playing
game, which keeps all the sheets of paper from the gaming table at the
expense of all the people around it.  A computer game can have all the
trappings of a paper role-playing game (the Tolkienesque dwarves and
elves, the "character classes," "to-hit rolls," and "experience levels"),
but without role-playing it's not an RPG.
It's computer strategy game about paper RPG's.  Some of them are 
okay.

<P>
The point of all this talk about computer role-playing games is not to
claim that this project of ours is or isn't an RPG.  The point is that
great games don't happen by shoe-horning your design into
a rigid category made up by some magazine.  We've spent years in
pursuit of a truly immersive experience, and we see a
continuous line of development from <CITE>Underworld</CITE> through
<CITE>System Shock</CITE> to the Dark Project.  We touched off a lot of
discussion on the 'net (and yes, we were reading it all) about whether
<CITE>System Shock</CITE> was an RPG, or a <CITE>Doom</CITE> clone, or whatever.  Like
as not the same people who thought <CITE>System Shock</CITE> was a
<CITE>Doom</CITE> clone will think that this game is a <CITE>Quake</CITE>
clone.  And they'll be just as wrong.  
<P>
What it <em>will</em> be is one
thing that <CITE>Shock</CITE> was, which is a damned fine game, the like
of which nobody else could (or would) do.
