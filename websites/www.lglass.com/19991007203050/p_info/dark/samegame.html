<A HREF="band.html#mahk">MAHK</A> runs a <A HREF="http://www.io.com/sjgames/gurps/books/Illuminati/">
<CITE>GURPS Illuminati</CITE></A> campaign he calls "Gedankenspiel," 
set in a version of the 
<A HREF="http://members.aol.com/atlasgames/ote.html">Over the Edge</A>
universe.  He has used
<A HREF="http://www.squaresoft.com/ff7-games.html"><CITE>Final Fantasy&nbsp;7</CITE></A>
to force Tim to concede that there <em>are</em> good PlayStation games.
He wants you to play <CITE>Settlers 
of Catan</CITE> today.  Mahk got 70 stars in <CITE>Super Mario&nbsp;64</CITE>.

<P>
<A HREF="band.html#stellmach">Tim</A> plays in Mahk's Gedankenspiel run as Angus MacAllan, the world's most charismatic
performance artist.  If only his real-life minions displayed the slavish and
suicidal devotion of his Gedankenspiel followers.
<P>
Tim wants you to know, despite the fact that its combats are actually interesting,
<A HREF="http://www.squaresoft.com/">Final Fantasy Tactics</A> is really a CRPG at heart.  Play it.
Tim got 90 stars in <CITE>Super Mario&nbsp;64</CITE>, and is getting a wee bit
impatient for <CITE>Zelda&nbsp;64</CITE>.

<P>
<A HREF="band.html#church">Doug</a> presents the illusion
of buying lots of games and leaving them
in shrink-wrap on the shelves in his office for lack of time to do
anything but work, then every once in a while surprises you by revealing
that he actually <em>does</em> play games in the 25<sup>th</sup> hour
of every day.  Plus he and Rob "Xemu" Fermier of Irrational Games have
a standing weekly appointment to play
<A HREF="http://www.ign64.com/thin/reviews/special/waverace/waverace.html">
<CITE>Wave&nbsp;Race</CITE></A>.

<P>
Tim, Doug, and a few other Looking Glass folks (such as
<A HREF="http://www.lglass.com/f2/index.html">Flight Unlimited's</A> own James "Jaemz" Fleming)
also play in a long-running
<A HREF="http://www.tsr.com/games/adnd/index.html">Dungeons&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Dragons</A>
game run via road trip by an old schoolmate of theirs now living in
Washington,&nbsp;D.C.
For reasons lost to the mists of time, the campaign is called
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Lair/4116/">Zen Jihad</A>.
Doug and Tim are currently the party's front-line fighters, Voodelmar and Yeenthra.
Voodelmar does damage; Yeenthra takes it.

<A HREF="band.html#hart">Dorian</A> GM's one AD&amp;D run (in which 
<A HREF="band.html#jenkins">Kate</A> and Peggy play) and plays in another.
On the machines, he's been playing <CITE>Warlords&nbsp;III</CITE> and <CITE>HOMM&nbsp;II</CITE>; on the wood slab,
he's been playing <CITE>Settlers of Catan</CITE> and <CITE>Robo-Rally</CITE>; and on the green carpet he's been playing
ultimate frisbee.  He doesn't remember how many stars he got in <CITE>Super Mario&nbsp;64</cite>, but it's an
embarassingly small number (in the 20's or 30's).

<P>
<A HREF="band.html#lopiccolo">Greg</A> doesn't play anything much other than his bass gee-tar.  That's why he's the boss.

We fondly remember vanquishing the Wizard of Frobozz, 
fulfilling the Quests of the Avatar,
and yes, we <em>can</em> name all three artifacts to be found 
in Dungeon
Module S2: "White Plume Mountain."<sup>*</sup>  In
recent times we've flown to <a href="http://www.microprose.com/gamesdesign/gamespage/backproducts/backproductpages/xcomtufo.html">
Cydonia</a>
to fend off the alien threat, we've blasted 
<a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/killer/doommac.html">Archviles</a>
and
<a href="http://www.stomped.com"> 
Vores</a>, we've even spent some time in the 
<a href="http://www.tombraider.com">
Lonely Planet of Somersaults and Wolves</a>. We
know what our THAC0s are, we've failed a few 
<a href="http://www.sirius.com/~chaosium/coc.html">SAN checks</a>, and
we've seen almost every use and abuse of a Variable Power Pool.
