<blockquote>
Adapting a paper game genre to the computer requires the
designers to change the way they think about the genre and discover the
power of the computer as a medium.  Role-playing is about imagining
yourself in a situation, maybe a strange, wonderful situation, and
expressing yourself in relation to that situation.  The social avenue of
expression we have at a weekend party game might be lacking, but the power
of the computer to free our imaginations is great.  You don't have to
imagine the fantasy world you're supposed to be in because you can see it,
hear it, and in some ways almost feel it.  This feeling of being there is
essential to the role-playing game, and it's what Looking Glass'
"immersive reality" philosophy is all about.
<P>
That's the hard technical problem.  The hard design problem is to put the
computer in the role of the single, most important person at the gaming
table -- the "game master" or referee.  A good game master is creative
enough to invent a compelling situation, and flexible enough to adjudicate
whatever response the players can come up with.  Inventing the situation
is our job as writers; the response to the player we have to leave up to
the computer.
<P>
The common approach to this problem involves scripting a variety of object
behaviors, so as to construct puzzles for the player to solve.  This is
fun up to a point, but it generally disallows the element of improvisation
which is such an important part of an RPG's creative challenge.  To unlock
this potential in our games requires designing not just puzzles and
quests, but interacting systems which the player can experiment with. 
These systems include things like the physics simulation and player
movement, combat, magic, and skills, and our "Act/React" concept of object
interaction.  By setting up consistent rules for each such system, and
designing interactions between them in a common-sense but controlled way,
we end up with what is in essence one big system.
<P>
Because of the way this big system is constructed, it remains fairly
manageable (so we can ship games as close to on time as ever happens in
this business).  But paradoxically, the connections between subsystems
lead to interactions of interactions, and these multiply to the point
where even we the designers don't fully understand the big system.  This
is the essence of the concept of "emergent behaviors," a notion we picked
up from the fields of Artificial Life and Systems Analysis, and about
which there's probably lists of Ph.D. theses as long as your arm. 
(No shit, we really think about stuff like this.  Why should
the 3D graphics guys get all the fun playing with brain-grinding science?)
<P>
This "emergent behaviors" business
happens unintentionally in all sorts of projects, but if you're aware of
it it's something that you can purposefully design for.  We actually
<em>like</em> it when our playtesters manage to defeat a problem in a way that we never
thought of, despite the bugs it sometimes causes, because game-design-wise
these emergent behaviors are like free money from heaven.  Once your players
can surprise you like this, you know for damn sure they're being 
creative. Bet you didn't think I was ever going to tie this back into the old
"personal expression through creative improvisation" theme, eh?
