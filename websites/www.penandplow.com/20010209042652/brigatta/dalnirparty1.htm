<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic">We spent quite some time in Dalnir. Pretty
much a week. This was the ending result of our hard work...</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/dalnirparty1.jpg" width="674" height="359"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic">Eh..... some party, eh? They hang around
jars filled with Froglok Heads. ICKY!</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/dalnirparty2.jpg" width="491" height="395"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic">That stupid Sarnak tried to steal our
Froglok Head and jar. Stupid Sarnak paid with his life. Laghee was very ticked
off, if ya can tell by the way he pushed that Sarnak with all he had.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/dalnirparty3.jpg" width="424" height="436"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic">Can you believe this? They tried to
contain us in a hallway. Don't they know that it only makes our job EASIER?
Silly Sarnaks.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic">Ah... The item we came for. Vesudus put a
few little items in the forge behind him and came out with this dagger. Tell me,
honest... does that REALLY look like a dagger? Doesn't look like it, to me.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/dalnirparty5.jpg" width="426" height="363"></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic">I don't know about you, but I was more
worried about getting outta here.. not taking some silly picture for prosperity.</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic">We did manage to get out safely. Everyone
was so glad to be out, that they didn't wait around for a victory shot. Oh,
well... maybe next time, eh?</font></p>
