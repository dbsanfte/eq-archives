    <p><i>Dear Lord:<br>
    <br>
    Every single evening<br>
    As I'm lying here in bed<br>
    This tiny little prayer<br>
    Keeps running through my head.<br>
    <br>
    God bless my Mom and dad,<br>
    And other family.<br>
    Keep them warm and safe from harm<br>
    For they're so close to me.<br>
    <br>
    And God, there is one more thing<br>
    I wish that you could do.<br>
    Hope you don't mind me asking,<br>
    Bless my computer too.<br>
    <br>
    Now I know that it's not normal<br>
    To bless a mother board,<br>
    But listen just a second<br>
    While I explain to you 'My Lord'.<br>
    <br>
    You see, that little metal box<br>
    With speakers at the ends<br>
    Inside those small compartments<br>
    Rest so many of my FRIENDS.<br>
    <br>
    I know so much about them<br>
    The kindness that they give<br>
    And this little scrap of metal<br>
    Takes me in to where they live.<br>
    <br>
    By faith is how I know them<br>
    Much the same as you<br>
    We share in what life brings us<br>
    And from that our friendship grew.<br>
    <br>
    Please, take an extra minute<br>
    From your duties up above<br>
    To bless those in my address book<br>
    That's filled with so much love!<br>
    <br>
    Wherever else this prayer may reach<br>
    To each and every friend,<br>
    Bless each email inbox<br>
    And the person who hits 'Send'.<br>
    <br>
    When you update your heavenly list<br>
    On your own CD-Rom<br>
    Remember each who've said this prayer<br>
    Sent up to God.com.<br>
    <br>
    Amen.</i></p>
