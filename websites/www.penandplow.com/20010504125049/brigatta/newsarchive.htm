        weekend. Silly server LDs were interfering and causing a fuss.
        Fortunately, we got the pipe for Soularr's Robe before we had to finally
        give up. Congrats to Soularr on ya Robe. Tis about time, eh?</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Gaelic" size="3">I want to thank Tundra

        <p><font face="Gaelic" size="3">This weekend was a HIT! We had a nice
        turn-out from Clan Brigatta, Tundra Wolves, &amp; Battlehammer. We
        walked into Chardok and immediately started laying waste to the place.
        One small incident with a pet that got away, but after that, we were
        unstoppable. We managed to get quite a few spells, mostly for Cleric and
        Necro. We also got the Shaman Collar that was being sought after.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic" size="3">We will be trying again, this coming
        weekend. Get ready to head right back into the zone that had us scared,
        yet now is scared of us!</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic" size="3">On another note, the Tundra Wolves and
        Clan B alliance appears to be working well. Look to the alliance boards
        for future events between our two guilds!</font>

        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic" size="4">The family has been busy, as of late. We
        spent nearly 3 weeks in the Tower of Frozen Shadow, clearing floors 1
        thru 6a. We are going to go back to attempt to clear 6b thru 8, at a
        later date. Many good drops were had, here. Prophecy Scroll for the
        shaman, druid, and clerics. The Sorcerer's Bowl for the casters. This is
        a fine tower to level from 30 to 50, if desired, and is mostly
        undiscovered by the rest of Norrath.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic" size="4">We are planning our 2nd Chardok raid in
        hopes of attaining the last piece for Soularr to complete his robe
        quest. Our guild friends, the Tundra Wolves, will be attending this
        event with us!</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic" size="4">We have a new section to our web site.

        </h3>
        <p>
        <font face="Gaelic">Been a bit since last update.. again. We have been
        busy exploring and having fun in new places. The Tower of Frozen Shadow
        has become a much-loved zone. We have slaughtered and killed all the way
        to the 5th level. Many items, no drop and not, have been gained and the
        family seems to enjoy staying there.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On Feb 22nd, we moved to LGuk. We were after the
        Evil Eye bag. It was a grand adventure, netting almost 10 EE bags for
        the guild. Course, we also learned that there IS ONE stupid froggie that
        CAN see through invis and is NOT an undead froggie. We are heading back
        tonite for another midnite raid, but this time we will be camping the
        EBCP (Enameled Black Chest Plate) for the tanks in the family.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">When we are done with LGuk, we will most likely
        head back to the Tower for some more explorations. There is much we
        still haven't done and it should be fun figuring it all out.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic"><b>CONGRATULATIONS</b> to <b>Wizat</b> on being
        the FIRST in Clan Brigatta to achieve level 60. We enjoy having this
        Sorcerer with us and wish him well on his new endeavors.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic"><b>CONGRATULATIONS</b> to <b>Soularr</b> on
        achieving his personal goal of 56. He is a Master, now and we appreciate
        all he has done for the family.&nbsp; A little birdie told me that he is
        inches away from getting his MUCH wanted Raster Robe, too. So,
        Congratulations on that!</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On a final note... Family members need to check
        the boards. The guild banker inventory is finished and all items that
        are available are posted.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="center">
        <font face="Gaelic" size="4">Jan 20, 2001</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">The family has been busy... we added a few new
        members. Aleion, 54 Magician. Wizat, 58th Wizard. Embrosa, 43rd Cleric.
        Welcome to the family. May your stay with us be long and fulfilling.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On Jan 12, we went into Eastern Wastes. We killed
        a bit and were killed a bit. It was a wonderful learnin experience for
        all. First time groupin with the family were Gibbi, Wulolil, and Vesudus.
        They have said they had a lot of fun and look forward to more.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On Jan 13, we headed into LGuk. We had 2 full
        parties and quickly found out that LGuk was camped to the gills. We did
        find an opening in the King room and proceeded to head there. It was
        rough, but it was fun. Casiopia joined us for a family raid for the
        first time. Among normal drops, we acquired A Black Tome with Silver
        Runes (Trentonic), a Mith 2 hander (Gibbi), a Plat Tiara (Trentonic),
        and 2 Crowns of Froglok King (Ladi Sarinja &amp; the second went to
        guild bank). Later in the evening, we headed to the Exe/Sav spawn.
        There, we acquired an Exe Axe (Starnn). After a long day and night, we
        camped out with plans to get together to head to Kaesora the next day.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On Jan 14th, we converged on Kaesora. We camped
        the Librarian and the Burned-Out Hut. We acquired 2 Spirit Tomes (Illusorer
        &amp; Ladi Sarinja), several Dusty Ransacker Bags, a Kunzar Mantle (Tynen
        &amp; Ladi Sarinja), and a Spectral Shroud (Guild banker). We had a lot
        of fun learnin this new zone and look forward to goin back again.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">Durin the week, several talks occured between
        Clan Brigatta and Clan Battlehammer. We have since furthered talks by
        creatin a seperate area on the message boards for everyone in both
        Clan's to talk. Ask an officer or fellow family member to acquire the
        password for this board.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On Wed, Jan 17th, we had an all-guild level 40+
        meeting. Many topics were discussed.. including where the 'elders' of
        the family would like to camp in the future. A lot of ideas came out of
        this and one was campin City of Mist. We headed there after the meeting
        and have been there since. Several family members acquired levels and we
        did obtain one drop so far. It was the Master Wu's Trance Stick, which
        went to Soularr. We will be stayin in CoM till Monday morning, Jan 22nd.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">Another topic discussed was the possibility of
        adding a second message board to the web site. This message board will
        be for the discussion of classes inside the Family. Look for it in the
        comin week, as the final plans are made and it is created.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="4">Jan 4,
        2001</font></p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">Been a few days since last update, and the Family
        has been busy. We started off on Sat with a family raid on Dalnir. 2
        days later, we walked out with a few items wanted, and a few family
        members with new levels. Of particular note, the necro dagger quest was
        finished by Vesudus with the help of the family. Click <a href="dalnirparty1.htm"> here</a> for a few
        pictures of that adventure.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">We left there and headed to Velius, stopping in
        the Crystal Caverns off Eastern Wastes. After a lengthy descent, we came
        to the crystal spiders. The family fought here for some time and managed
        to kill the Queen Spider and obtain a robe for Scorpious.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">After the Dalnir raid was finished, some of us
        headed to Karnor's Castle. For some, it was the first time in KC. Tynen,
        Jenkin, Torf, and Soularr especially. Watch here for pics from that fun
        party. We have since been to KC a few times and just today, a Lupine
        Dagger dropped in the Captain's room. Ladi Sarinja won the roll on it
        and is currently deciding what will be done with it. The KC parties will
        continue, whenever there are members enough to enjoy it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">A reminder, the wedding of Ladi Sarinja and Torf
        will be held on Jan 6th, at Lesser Faydark old tower. It will be at
        640pm, PST and afterwards, we will be heading to the Lake Rathe Arena
        for some fun. This party will be the last good-bye to Grandfather
        Amilius. He will be going on long-term AFK as of Sunday, the 7th. We
        want to send him off with love, so stop on by. Perhaps we will all take
        to tacklng his powerful pet and finally winning against it. Transport
        will be provided, so hollar up and let us know.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On a last note, during this past week, several
        levels were obtained by our family members. Soularr &amp; Amilius made
        52, Ladi Sarinja made 51, and Flynnc acquired 46. He made it out of the
        dreaded 45 by fighting Bloodgills in the Lake of Ill Omen.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="4">Dec 28, 2000</font></p>
<p><font face="Gaelic" size="3">The Holidays are over. Back to work, we go.
Today starts the Family Dalnir raid. Started at around midnite, Torf, Soularr,
and Ladi Sarinja moved into Dalnir to start acquirin some of the much needed
items.</font></p>
<p><font face="Gaelic" size="3">The following items have already been acquired:
Crestent Pants (which went to Soularr), a pair of Worm-Eaten Gloves (went to
Vesudus), 2 Sarnak Emblazoned Talbards, Tower Guards' Blade, Sarnak Ceremonial
Sword, Bo stick &amp; Greenwood Bo stick, Fighting Baton (goes to Nimbley), 3
Black Pearls, and a Traitor's Heart. The Traitor's Heart is no drop for unknown
quest. Ladi Sarinja looted it and will be attempting to look up the quest to see
what it is for.</font></p>
<p><font face="Gaelic" size="3">We camped out for the nite at 530a and will be
returning after some much-needed sleep.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="4">Dec 24, 2000</font></p>
<p><font face="Gaelic" size="3" color="#808080">It's Christmas Eve and y'all are
headin out to join your friends and family for some fun and good cheer. Torf and
I wanna personally wish y'all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy Holiday. We
will be gone until tomorrow afternoon/early evenin. Stay safe and we will hope
for y'alls speedy and safe return after the holiday.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="4">Dec 22, 2000</font></p>
<p><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="3">We are finished campin in SolA.
Today, Trelayne got a cloak and we managed to get one more Plat Arm Band. It's
time to move on to somethin else. The decision is not yet made, but we are
thinkin either LGuk or KC. Input is welcome from all on where we wish to go
next.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="4">Dec 21, 2000</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="3">Continued raid on
SolA, today. Only we branched out a bit. We had Trelayne and Lonear on Gabbie,
Wacckie (playin alt) on Lava Elemental, and me on Reckless Efreeti. We ended up
getting a third Molten Cloak, which went to <b>Tynen</b>. He has been with us
the past few days and only wasn't here today because he had duty. <b>Congrats</b>
to Trelayne, on his new Plat Arm Band. We also got an Obsidian Ring, Obsidian
Bead Hoop, a pair of Charred Guantlets (all three of these went to Wacckie.. who
is wearing leather), and much fine steel to sell for pp. The raid is not over,
as it is only 530pm, but we are goin strong. Ladi Sarinja did get an Obisidian
Flamberge. She looted it only after checkin the guild and the zone to see if
anyone wanted it. It is no drop, so will probably just be stored away in her
bank.</font></p>
