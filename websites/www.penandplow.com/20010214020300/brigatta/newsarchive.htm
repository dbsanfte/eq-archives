        <p align="center"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="4">Jan 4,
        2001</font></p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">Been a few days since last update, and the Family
        has been busy. We started off on Sat with a family raid on Dalnir. 2
        days later, we walked out with a few items wanted, and a few family
        members with new levels. Of particular note, the necro dagger quest was
        finished by Vesudus with the help of the family. Click <a href="dalnirparty1.htm"> here</a> for a few
        pictures of that adventure.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">We left there and headed to Velius, stopping in
        the Crystal Caverns off Eastern Wastes. After a lengthy descent, we came
        to the crystal spiders. The family fought here for some time and managed
        to kill the Queen Spider and obtain a robe for Scorpious.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">After the Dalnir raid was finished, some of us
        headed to Karnor's Castle. For some, it was the first time in KC. Tynen,
        Jenkin, Torf, and Soularr especially. Watch here for pics from that fun
        party. We have since been to KC a few times and just today, a Lupine
        Dagger dropped in the Captain's room. Ladi Sarinja won the roll on it
        and is currently deciding what will be done with it. The KC parties will
        continue, whenever there are members enough to enjoy it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">A reminder, the wedding of Ladi Sarinja and Torf
        will be held on Jan 6th, at Lesser Faydark old tower. It will be at
        640pm, PST and afterwards, we will be heading to the Lake Rathe Arena
        for some fun. This party will be the last good-bye to Grandfather
        Amilius. He will be going on long-term AFK as of Sunday, the 7th. We
        want to send him off with love, so stop on by. Perhaps we will all take
        to tacklng his powerful pet and finally winning against it. Transport
        will be provided, so hollar up and let us know.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On a last note, during this past week, several
        levels were obtained by our family members. Soularr &amp; Amilius made
        52, Ladi Sarinja made 51, and Flynnc acquired 46. He made it out of the
        dreaded 45 by fighting Bloodgills in the Lake of Ill Omen.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="4">Dec 28, 2000</font></p>
<p><font face="Gaelic" size="3">The Holidays are over. Back to work, we go.
Today starts the Family Dalnir raid. Started at around midnite, Torf, Soularr,
and Ladi Sarinja moved into Dalnir to start acquirin some of the much needed
items.</font></p>
<p><font face="Gaelic" size="3">The following items have already been acquired:
Crestent Pants (which went to Soularr), a pair of Worm-Eaten Gloves (went to
Vesudus), 2 Sarnak Emblazoned Talbards, Tower Guards' Blade, Sarnak Ceremonial
Sword, Bo stick &amp; Greenwood Bo stick, Fighting Baton (goes to Nimbley), 3
Black Pearls, and a Traitor's Heart. The Traitor's Heart is no drop for unknown
quest. Ladi Sarinja looted it and will be attempting to look up the quest to see
what it is for.</font></p>
<p><font face="Gaelic" size="3">We camped out for the nite at 530a and will be
returning after some much-needed sleep.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="4">Dec 24, 2000</font></p>
<p><font face="Gaelic" size="3" color="#808080">It's Christmas Eve and y'all are
headin out to join your friends and family for some fun and good cheer. Torf and
I wanna personally wish y'all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy Holiday. We
will be gone until tomorrow afternoon/early evenin. Stay safe and we will hope
for y'alls speedy and safe return after the holiday.</font></p>

<p><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="3">We are finished campin in SolA.
Today, Trelayne got a cloak and we managed to get one more Plat Arm Band. It's
time to move on to somethin else. The decision is not yet made, but we are
thinkin either LGuk or KC. Input is welcome from all on where we wish to go
next.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="4">Dec 21, 2000</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Gaelic" color="#808080" size="3">Continued raid on
SolA, today. Only we branched out a bit. We had Trelayne and Lonear on Gabbie,
Wacckie (playin alt) on Lava Elemental, and me on Reckless Efreeti. We ended up
getting a third Molten Cloak, which went to <b>Tynen</b>. He has been with us
the past few days and only wasn't here today because he had duty. <b>Congrats</b>
to Trelayne, on his new Plat Arm Band. We also got an Obsidian Ring, Obsidian
Bead Hoop, a pair of Charred Guantlets (all three of these went to Wacckie.. who
is wearing leather), and much fine steel to sell for pp. The raid is not over,
as it is only 530pm, but we are goin strong. Ladi Sarinja did get an Obisidian
Flamberge. She looted it only after checkin the guild and the zone to see if
anyone wanted it. It is no drop, so will probably just be stored away in her
bank.</font></p>

Website has gone live... Any articles, news, and pictures should be forwarded to
the either <a href="mailto:ladihevnli@penandplow.com">Ladi Sarinja</a> or <a href="mailto:mglyman@qwest.net">Torf</a>.
Any pictures should be in jpg format to assist Ladi Sarinja and Torf in postin
them to the web site faster.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#808080" size="3" face="Gaelic">We hope to add a
page for the members and their pics. We would like everyone to take their best
pic of themselves, without names, and email it in.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#808080" size="3" face="Gaelic">We will be lookin
for someone to post the daily &amp; weekly news. So, if ya are someone around a
lot and have a writtin skill (without my slang, of course), please let Ladi
Sarinja or Torf know! We could use all the help we can get.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#808080" size="3" face="Gaelic">With the new web
site, we have our Charter and Policies. I ask that everyone review them and make
a notation on the boards that ya have read them. We need full family
participation on this so we can plan for bigger and better.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#808080" size="3" face="Gaelic">Another Molten
Cloak dropped, already today. Congratulations to Torf. We will be stayin here
for a time.. tryin to get more cloaks. They are not LORE, so I should be able to
gather some for everyone, but it would really be nice to have someone else
there. Don't really need the help.. just the company on a long spawn.</font></p>
