      of Conduct</font></a></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">1. Clan Brigatta is first and
      foremost a guild of friendship and family. We are together because we
      enjoy each other's company and adventuring together. We exist to help each
      other become stronger and wiser in the ways of Norrath. If you cannot
      accept this and are only interested in joining for loot, you've found the
      wrong guild.<br>
      <br>
      2.Obviously, disagreements or differences of opinion will surface in guild
      chat. When these situations get out of hand, you will be asked to continue
      your discussion by a more appropriate means, i.e., tells, group chat, or
      the message board. The message board is a place for rational discussion
      and conversation. Name calling, flaming, excessive swearing with the
      intent to harass or hurt another guild member, and excessive,
      intentionally cruel sarcasm will not be tolerated.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Clan Brigatta strives to collaborate
      and interact with other guilds and players on Druzzil Ro in an amiable,
      honorable, and just manner. All members should attempt to work out
      problems with other guilds and/or players calmly and rationally. If you
      find yourself in a bad situation that tries your patience or temper, take
      the situation to a Circle member for an attempt at resolution. We
      recognize that many people who play EverQuest do not extend the same
      courtesies to us, as we try to extend to them. All we ask is that you do
      your best to represent Clan Brigatta in a positive light.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;3. Leadership is important and
      officers have been selected to lead the guild through taking on certain
      responsibilities that are vital to the efficient and smooth functioning of
      the family. Guild members are free to ask questions and make suggestions,
      even to volunteer to work with the officers. Please do not challenge
      officers in a negative fashion, understand that anyone that holds a higher
      position, be it the Guild Master or Officer, is doing so as a service to
      the entire guild and not to &quot;lord&quot; it over anyone in the guild.
      We are a group of friends, and people hold these positions because without
      leadership nothing will ever get done.<br>
      <br>
      4. Clan Brigatta will be there for each other in times of need. We are
      there to help each other when things go bad. It is a fact that people will
      get frustrated, feel depressed or even isolated from time to time. Don't
      let this get you down, we will only be strong when we have the wisdom to
      work through the hard times together and when we do that, nothing can stop
      us. If a family member is truly in need then it should be easy for someone
      close to give a hand.. Not helping a member that really needs it is
      inexcusable. Examples include corpse recovery, but not ports,
      resurrection, or such. Ports and resurrections are a benefit of your
      family and not to be abused. Everyone is here to enjoy the game, but if
      you really need help then we should be there to help you.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">5. It is the responsibility of each
      family member to check the boards regularly. All meetings, quests, and
      events should be posted there (unless they develop on the spur of the
      moment and whim of the family) at least a week in advance.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">6. Members are required to show
      their flag at all times. If you don't show the flag then you aren't proud
      to be a family member and will be reconsidered for family membership.
      Roleplay is suitable for hiding class &amp; level, but anon is restricted
      from family members.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">7. Members are required to be in
      attendance at all guild meetings.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">A.) If you are unable to attend
        and are online while the event is in progress, we will reevaluate
        whether you really want to be part of us. Contact an officer if you are
        unable to make an event. Meetings and prescheduled events take
        precedence over spur of the moment raids.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">B.) Members are expected to attend
        scheduled events, at least once a week, if online. Continual missing of
        family events will result in reevaluation of membership.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">8. Lastly, Clan Brigatta WILL NOT
      TOLERATE kill stealing, power looting or cursing people or other guilds in
      /shout or /ooc. Show some restraint and do not allow yourself to be
      provoked. Your actions in these channels reflect upon every guild member.
      Reports of inappropriate use of these channels will be investigated and
      dealt with.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">1. All membership requests will be
      posted in the New Member Discussion section of our boards.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">a) This will ensure that everyone
        has a chance to see that we have a potential new member.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">b) This will also ensure that
        everyone has a chance to voice their opinion on this person before the
        officers decide to invite them to the family.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">c) The discussion on this board
        will be moved to Preserved Threads before this potential member is
        invited to the family.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">d) The officer moving this
        discussion will post the final decision on the thread before moving it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">e) Names on this board will remain
        for at least ONE week before a decision is made. If the potential is
        under 46, they will remain till ONE week after the potential reaches 46.
        The potential will be voted on and approved or disapproved after ONE
        week.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">2. A minimum level required to join
      is 46.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">3. All new family members will be in
      a 30-day probationary period.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">a) The initial vote for a new
        family member will be done by the Circle of Six after viewing all the
        discussion on the New Member Board (before they are invited). All family
        members are encouraged to get to know the potential listed on the board
        and then post their opinions on the board.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">b) After the initial vote to join
        a new family member, there will be a second vote by the officers and the
        sponsor 30 days after they are invited to the family.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">c) Upon receiving full family
        status (after the 30 days), the new family member will be given 50
        points on the point system.</font></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#000000"> 1) This should
        help balance out the new member with existing family members. Give them
        an opportunity for drops and such.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">4. Real life family members and real
      life friends are automatically approved for family membership.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">a) The 30-day probationary period
        is still in effect with these members.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">b) If a real life friend or family
        member is under the current base level of Clan Brigatta, they will be
        reminded of such and still joined to family.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">II. Recruitment Policies</font>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">1. All players submitted to the
      Circle are treated equally, whether they be friends of the family, or new
      friends seeking a good natured playing environment.</font>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">2. Any non-officer may submit a
      players name along with his or her recommendation to the New Member
      Discussion Board.</font>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">3. No family member shall at any
      time actively seek players to join the guild that he/she does not know</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">a) Such practices as shouting for
        members to join in a zone are not positive ways in which to build our
        family.</font></p>

        time actively recruit players that already have a guild.</font></p>

      <p align="center"><a name="Loot Policy"><font color="#000000">Loot Policy</font></a></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">1. The following rules apply only to
      guild sponsored events and no other camp, spawn, drop, loot, quest, or
      event, regardless of the number of guild mates in group. For the sake of
      these rules, guild groups are specified by group leader or officer.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">2. Race/Class specific equipment
      (i.e., non ALL/ALL) will go only to those members of the family at the
      event that can use the equipment. When more than one person can
      effectively use the piece of equipment, then the following will occur.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">a) If more than one member is
        participating and can use the item, then the member with the most points
        earned will receive the item.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="left"><font color="#000000">1) If this person declines the
          item, then it will go to the next on the list. This will proceed down
          till all have declined or one has accepted the drop.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#000000">2) When the member accepts an
          item from the raid, it will lower his points by 50. This allows others
          to move up the list and receive items.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">b) If none at the event have a
        desire for the item, there will be a group roll with the winner
        acquiring the item to do with as they wish.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">d) If none want the item, it will
        go to the Guild Banker for distribution to guild mates.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">3. ALL/ALL equipment will go to the
      race/class that it will be of the most benefit to.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">a) If more than one member is
        participating in the event that will benefit from the item, then the
        item will be given according to the conditions listed above.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">b) I.E., Stamina/Haste/AC items
        have the most benefit to the fighting class whereas Int/Wis have the
        most benefit to the casters &amp; priests.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">c) If there is a dispute as to who
        will benefit most, then the senior officer at the raid will decide. If
        no decision can be reached, the item will be set aside pending
        discussion by the Circle of Six.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">4. No Drop items will be assessed in
      order to determine who will best benefit from them.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">a) If it is no drop only because
        of supreme stats or other use, it will be determined according to the
        conditions outlined in #3.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">b) No drop quest items will also
        be determined as outlined above.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">c) Any no drop whose value can not
        be determined will go to an officer.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">d) If more than one officer is
        participating in the event, then the item will go to the officer with
        seniority.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">5. Quest items will be decided as
      outlined above.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">6. ALL items gained by family
      members from the guild banker will be returned to the guild banker when
      the member no longer has use for it, except for the NO DROP items
      acquired.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">a) A family member will NOT sell
        such items, nor TRADE them for better items.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">b) Family members who are found to
        have given away, traded, or sold items gained from a family event will
        be disciplined according to the rules stated in the Charter.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000000">7. God/Dragon/Boss Loot will be

      System</font></a></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">1. When you arrive on a raid, you will sign in
      with the &quot;Raid Leader&quot;</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000000">a) The &quot;Raid Leader&quot; is responsible
        for guild mates at the raid, in addition to posting the results of the
        raid on the &quot;Attendance&quot; section of our boards.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">b) After the raid, an officer will update the
        points in our point system database.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">c) If something is acquired by one of our
        members or guests on a raid, the person who acquired the item will lose
        50 points on the Point System Board.</font></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><font color="#000000">1) This will allow others a chance at getting
          drops at future raids.</font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000000">d) Guests will be afforded the same courtesy
        for earning and spending points as Clan Brigatta members.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font color="#000000">2. There will be plenty of opportunities for all
      family members to earn points. Spur of the moment raids, surprise events,
      and other items will be cause for adding points to the Point System Board.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000000">a) The Circle of Six will always accept input
        from members on something that they deem worthy of the extra points.
        Just submit a private message, on the boards, to an officer to get your
        idea posted to the officers board.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">b) Sinya will be running a &quot;mirror&quot;
        of our evening activities in the later evening hours. She will be
        keeping track of the people who are late niters and making sure that
        they have the same chance as the rest of the family for gaining more
        points.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font color="#000000">3) If a member is found to have been belligerent,
      or in another fashion disruptive on a raid, then there will be an officer
      vote (in private, on the boards) for that member to lose 10 points from
      the Point System Board.</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000000">a) The reason for this is because of the many
        things the &quot;Raid Leader&quot; and officers have to do on the raids.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000000">b) Constantly reminding someone to &quot;Get
        off the walls&quot;, or to &quot;Back up behind a certain point&quot;,
        or to &quot;Stop rushing the incoming NPC&quot;, requires time and
        effort that only causes more grief on a raid than is necessary.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font color="#000000">4) The following is the list of points available:</font></p>
      <blockquote>

          <dt><font color="#000000">b) Weekend Raids - 20 points</font></dt>
          <dt><font color="#000000">c) Late for a raid, but planned ahead and

          <dt><font color="#000000">d) Late for a raid, but didn't plan ahead
            (IE, not in zone) - half points</font></dt>
