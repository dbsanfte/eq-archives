      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">The
      Family Clan Brigatta is an EverQuest guild that strives to promote peace
      and unity within all of Norrath. Clan Brigatta is founded upon the
      concepts of friendship, fun, generosity and helping each other become
      stronger and wiser in the ways of Norrath. Our guild policies are hereby
      set forth with these intentions in mind.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b><font size="3" color="#000000">Leadership
      Structure</font></b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">The
      leadership structure of Clan Brigatta is as follows: We have the
      Leadership Council made of six members, one of which is called the Guild
      Master. The Leadership Council will be known as the Circle of Six. The
      Guild Master is an equivalent member of the Circle of six. All guild
      practices, policies and procedures are the province of the Circle.
      Enforcement of the guild policies is the domain of the Circle. Any Circle
      member can request a meeting based on their own or guild member requests.
      The Circle strives to be fair, honorable and just in all decisions that it
      makes and policies that it implements. Circle decisions are final. If a
      Circle member leaves the guild or the game, there will be a vote within
      the Circle to replace said person. All guild members in good standing will
      be eligible for nomination. If the GM leaves the guild or the game, there
      will be a guild-wide vote to replace the GM. The candidates for the GM
      position will be the current circle members. Guild member input and
      participation is requested and encouraged through the means of the
      members-only board. The policies/guidelines are, however, subject to
      review and revision by the Circle. No member of the Circle is above the
      standards listed in this or other policy documents. We are all equal
      members and all subject to the same rules.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b><font size="3" color="#000000">Guild
      Membership</font></b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      New member recruitment will be covered by the Membership Rules, which is
      maintained and updated by the Circle and subject to review/revision by the
      Circle. People will from time to time become inactive. We must ask members
      to notify us when they are leaving for an extended period of time. If a
      member leaves for an extended period they will be put on AFK status. This
      will be done so that everyone will know that we have a missing family
      member.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b><font size="3" color="#000000">Membership
      Standards</font></b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      As per the ideals of the guild philosophy, Clan Brigatta members will be
      expected to adhere to some basic, common sense guidelines. Every member is
      equal and deserves to be treated with common courtesy and respect. To that
      end, inappropriate behavior or unreasonable abuse by members towards other
      members or other guilds/players will not be tolerated. Such behaviors are
      further explained in the Rules of Conduct.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b><font size="3" color="#000000">Conflict
      Resolution</font></b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      If guild members encounter problems or situations that they do not know
      how to handle, or have a disagreement that needs to be mediated, please
      contact a Circle member. Based on the member's request, he or she will
      either make a determination on their own or take the issue to the Circle
      for discussion and resolution. If a large group of guild members has a
      serious issue or concern, please submit such to the members only Board. We
      will take guild input, meet, and come to a determination.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b><font size="3" color="#000000">Member
      Probation and Removal</font></b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      If it is found that members are breaking the standards set forth above, it
      will be necessary for the Circle to take action. Upon report of
      inappropriate actions, the Circle will take into consideration both sides
      of the complaint. All members of the dispute will be dealt with calmly,
      rationally, fairly, and with respect. The Circle will gather evidence it
      deems necessary to make an equitable decision.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Once the Circle makes a determination, a Circle member will contact the
      guild member privately and discuss the finding. The decision will then be
      posted on the message board, and the Circle will set forth with the
      appropriate action. Clan Brigatta will pride itself on being honorable,
      wise and just.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      If a member of Clan Brigatta is accused of kill stealing or power looting,
      the Circle will investigate this charge immediately. If power looting is
      found to have happened, the member will be immediately guild removed.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Kill stealing is an area with many shades of gray. The Circle will not
      immediately call for guild removal on a report of kill stealing. The
      Circle will very carefully investigate all reports of kill stealing and
      make a considered determination. If kill stealing is found to have
      happened, the member will be immediately guild removed.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      If other Rules of Conduct are broken, a member of the Circle will
      privately discuss the situation with the guild member. The guild member
      will receive a warning. If said guild member commits a second
      inappropriate action, the guild member will be put on a month long
      probation. If a guild member again breaks the standards in this month long
      period, they will be guild removed. After a month, the guild member will
      return to good and honorable Family status. If a Circle member is found to
      have broken the standards, they will be removed from their position, then
      placed in the probationary process. They will not get their position back.
      If a guild member is found to have again broken the standards after having
      received both a warning and one probationary period, they will be guild
      removed.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Should a family member leave the guild, their current point total will be
      set to zero. This will ensure that if they do return, they are not above
      the current family members who have stayed.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b><font size="3" color="#000000">Award
      of Loot</font></b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Loot issues will be covered by the Circle, which are maintained and
      updated in the Loot Policy. Loot issues being such a large portion of the
      game, it is again necessary to set forth some basic standards, as per the
      ideals of the guild philosophy. Particular ideals to concern us here are
      friendship and helping others in the guild. The following principles are
      intended for highly desired items (for example, FBSSs, Golden Efreeti
      Boots, Shiny Metallic Robes). They are not intended for easily
      obtainable/common items.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The distribution of God/Dragon/Boss items are the province of the Circle
      and will be given out on the basis of these guidelines. Again, these
      guidelines are subject to the review/revision of the Circle and will be
      posted in the Loot Policy. Refusal to follow the Loot Policy will subject
      you to the Member Probation and Removal policy.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b><font size="3" color="#000000">Leaving
      the Family</font></b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      If a family member leaves of their own accord to join another guild on
      Druzzil Ro, we will wish them well and let them go peacefully. If, in the
      future, they wish to return, then they will go through the same
      Recruitment processes set forth by the Circle.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      As with every guild, we will have internal problems. If a member has a
      problem, they should work out their problems using the above methodology.
      If they are unable to work their issues out, then we bid them farewell. In
      rare cases, we will consider re-accepting members. In this case, former
      members will have to go through the Recruitment processes set forth by the
      Circle.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Should a family member leave the guild, their current point total will be
      set to zero. This will ensure that if they do return, they are not above
      the current family members who have stayed.</font></p>
      <p align="center" style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><b><font size="3" color="#000000">Conclusion</font></b></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The Family Clan Brigatta is fortunate to have talented, honorable and wise
      members. This document is a collection and formal recognition of many of
      the ideals and standards of our family. By being guilded in Clan Brigatta,
      each member affirms the above standards and agrees to abide by them.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20; margin-right: 20"><font size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      of Family Clan Brigatta in a honorable, wise and just manner, with

      spirit of the philosophies set forth herein. We pledge to resolve disputes
      to the best of our abilities with the input from all guild members.</font></p>
