        <p><font face="Gaelic">The family has been busy... we added a few new
        members. Aleion, 54 Magician. Wizat, 58th Wizard. Embrosa, 43rd Cleric.
        Welcome to the family. May your stay with us be long and fulfilling.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On Jan 12, we went into Eastern Wastes. We killed
        a bit and were killed a bit. It was a wonderful learnin experience for
        all. First time groupin with the family were Gibbi, Wulolil, and Vesudus.
        They have said they had a lot of fun and look forward to more.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On Jan 13, we headed into LGuk. We had 2 full
        parties and quickly found out that LGuk was camped to the gills. We did
        find an opening in the King room and proceeded to head there. It was
        rough, but it was fun. Casiopia joined us for a family raid for the
        first time. Among normal drops, we acquired A Black Tome with Silver
        Runes (Trentonic), a Mith 2 hander (Gibbi), a Plat Tiara (Trentonic),
        and 2 Crowns of Froglok King (Ladi Sarinja &amp; the second went to
        guild bank). Later in the evening, we headed to the Exe/Sav spawn.
        There, we acquired an Exe Axe (Starnn). After a long day and night, we
        camped out with plans to get together to head to Kaesora the next day.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On Jan 14th, we converged on Kaesora. We camped
        the Librarian and the Burned-Out Hut. We acquired 2 Spirit Tomes (Illusorer
        &amp; Ladi Sarinja), several Dusty Ransacker Bags, a Kunzar Mantle (Tynen
        &amp; Ladi Sarinja), and a Spectral Shroud (Guild banker). We had a lot
        of fun learnin this new zone and look forward to goin back again.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">Durin the week, several talks occured between
        Clan Brigatta and Clan Battlehammer. We have since furthered talks by
        creatin a seperate area on the message boards for everyone in both
        Clan's to talk. Ask an officer or fellow family member to acquire the
        password for this board.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">On Wed, Jan 17th, we had an all-guild level 40+
        meeting. Many topics were discussed.. including where the 'elders' of
        the family would like to camp in the future. A lot of ideas came out of
        this and one was campin City of Mist. We headed there after the meeting
        and have been there since. Several family members acquired levels and we
        did obtain one drop so far. It was the Master Wu's Trance Stick, which
        went to Soularr. We will be stayin in CoM till Monday morning, Jan 22nd.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Gaelic">Another topic discussed was the possibility of
        adding a second message board to the web site. This message board will
        be for the discussion of classes inside the Family. Look for it in the
        comin week, as the final plans are made and it is created.</font>
