of Conduct</a></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">1. Clan Brigatta is first and foremost a
guild of friendship and family. We are together because we enjoy each other's
company and adventuring together. We exist to help each other become stronger
and wiser in the ways of Norrath. If you cannot accept this and are only
interested in joining for loot, you've found the wrong guild.<br>
<br>
2.Obviously, disagreements or differences of opinion will surface in guild chat.
When these situations get out of hand, you will be asked to continue your
discussion by a more appropriate means, i.e., tells, group chat, or the message
board. The message board is a place for rational discussion and conversation.
Name calling, flaming, excessive swearing with the intent to harass or hurt
another guild member, and excessive, intentionally cruel sarcasm will not be
tolerated.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">Clan Brigatta strives to collaborate and
interact with other guilds and players on Druzzil Ro in an amiable, honorable,
and just manner. All members should attempt to work out problems with other
guilds/players calmly and rationally. If you find yourself in a bad situation
that tries your patience or temper, take the situation to a Circle member for an
attempt at resolution. We recognize that many people who play EverQuest do not
extend the same courtesies to us, as we try to extend to them. All we ask is
that you do your best to represent Clan Brigatta in a positive light.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Gaelic" size="2" color="#989898">&nbsp;3.
Leadership is important and officers have been selected to lead the guild
through taking on certain responsibilities that are vital to the efficient and
smooth functioning of the family. Guild members are free to ask questions and
make suggestions, even to volunteer to work with the officers. Please do not
challenge officers in a negative fashion, understand that anyone that holds a
higher position, be it the Guild Master or Officer, is doing so as a service to
the entire guild and not to &quot;lord&quot; it over anyone in the guild. We ARE
a group of friends, and people hold these positions because without leadership
nothing will ever get done.<br>
<br>
4. Clan Brigatta will be there for each other in times of need. We are there to
help each other when things go bad. It is a fact that people will get
frustrated, feel depressed or even isolated from time to time. Don't let this
get you down, we will only be strong when we have the wisdom to work through the
hard times together and when we do that nothing can stop us! If a family member
is truly in need then it should be easy for someone close to give a hand.. Not
helping a member that really needs it is inexcusable. Examples include corpse
recovery, but not ports, rezzes, or such. Ports and resurrections are a benefit
of your family and not to be abused. Everyone is here to enjoy the game, but if
you really need help then we should be there to help you.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">5. It is the responsibility of each family
member to check the boards regularly. All meetings, quests, and events should be
posted there (unless they develop on the spur of the moment and whim of the
family) at least a week in advance.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">6. Members are required to show their flag
at all times. If you don't show the flag then you aren't proud to be a family
member and will be reconsidered for family membership.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">7. Members are required to be in
attendance at all guild functions, i.e. meetings. If you are unable to attend
and are online while the event is in progress, we will reevaluate whether you
really want to be part of us. Contact an officer if you are unable to make an
event.<br>
<br>
8. Lastly, Clan Brigatta WILL NOT TOLERATE Kill Stealing, Power Looting or
Cursing people or other guilds in /shouts, or /oocs. Show some restraint and do
not allow yourself to be provoked. Your actions in these channels reflect upon
every guild member. Reports of inappropriate use of these channels will be
investigated and dealt with.</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">a) This will ensure that everyone has a
  chance to see that we have a potential new member.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">b) This will also ensure that everyone
  has a chance to voice their opinion on this person BEFORE the officers decide
  to join them.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">c) The discussion on this board will be

  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">d) The officer moving this discussion
  will post the final decision on the thread before moving it.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">e) Names on this board will remain for

</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">2. A minimum level required to join is 20.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">a) If a player under 20 wishes to join,
  they will be assigned a mentor who will guide them to their 20th season. The
  mentor will then make the recommendation to the guild on whether the player is
  suitable for family membership or not. If the player is then joined, they are
  subject to the sponsor system with the mentor being the sponsor.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">3. All new family members will be assigned
a sponsor by the Membership Officer.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">a) The sponsor is responsible for
  getting new members acquainted with the family and familiar with rules.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">b) If the potential new family member is
  over the age of 20, they will be joined after approval by the Circle and a
  sponsor will be assigned to them.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">4. All new family members will be in a
30-day probationary period.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">a) After the initial vote to join a new
  family member, there will be a second vote by the officers and the sponsor 30
  days after they are joined to the family.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">b) The initial vote for a new family
  member will be done by the Circle of Six after viewing all the discussion on
  the New Member Board. All family members are encouraged to get to know the
  potential listed on the board and then post their opinions on the board.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">5. Real life family members and real life
friends are automatically approved for family membership.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">a) The real life relation of these new
  family members will act as the sponsor.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">b) The 30 day probationary period is
  still in effect with these members.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">II. Recruitment Policies</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">1. All players submitted to the Circle are
treated equally, whether they be friends of the family, or new friends seeking a
good natured playing environment.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">2. Only officers may invite players to
join the family.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">a) Any non-officer may submit a players
  name along with his or her recommendation to the New Member Discussion Board.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">3. No family member shall at any time
actively seek users to join the guild that he/she does not know</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2">a) Such practices as shouting for
  members to join in a zone are not positive ways in which to build our family.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" face="Gaelic" size="2"><a href="#Top">Back

<p align="center"><font face="Old English Text MT" size="5" color="#C0C0C0"><a name="Loot Policy">Loot
Policy</a></font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">1. The following rules apply ONLY to guild
sponsored events and no other camp, spawn, drop, loot, quest, or event,
regardless of the number of guildmates in group. If there are 6 guildmates that
make up the group, then for the sake of the following rules, the previous
conditions have been met.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">2. Race/Class specific equipment (i.e.,
non ALL/ALL) will go only to those members of the family that can use the
equipment. When more than one person can effectively use the piece of equipment,
then two conditions must be met in order for an individual to receive the item.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">a) That item will go first to members
  participating in the family event.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">b) If more than one member is
  participating, then a random roll between 1 and 100 will be made with the
  highest roller being the winner.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">c) If noone in the event meets the
  requirements for the item, then the Loot Officer (or another officer at the
  event) will acquire it, pending further consideration on who would best be
  served by getting it.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">3. ALL/ALL equipment will go to the
race/class that it will be of the most benefit to. If more than one member is
participating in the event that will benefit from the item, then the item will
be given according to the conditions listed above. AC items will never go to
pure casters unless the melee class declines the item.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">4. No Drop items will be assessed in order
to determine who will best benefit from them.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">a) If it is no drop only because of
  supreme stats or other use, it will be determined according to the conditions
  outlined in #2.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">b) If it is no drop because of a quest,
  the see #5.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">c) Any no drop whose value can not be
  determined will go to an officer.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">d) If more than one officer is
  participating in the event, then the item will go to the officer with
  seniority.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">5. Quest items will be divided between the
members of the event who can use them as outlined by the conditions in #2. If
the quest item also has beneficial stats which will benefit a member of the
event, then they will also be added to the random roll. If noone can use the
quest item, then it will go to an officer for later distribution to the family.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">6. Officer responsibility for any acquired
item apart from their own winnings in random rolls will be as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">a) Non NO DROP items will be assessed
  and given to the player/alt determined who could best benefit.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">b) Only 2 alts per person will be
  considered when distributing loot from a family event. These 2 alts will be
  the 2 listed in the Character Matrix of the boards.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">c) NO DROP items will be assessed and
  any quest done which will yield non NO DROP items will be done if it is at all
  possible. The result will be given to the family member that is determined to
  make the most use of the item.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">d) If a player can not be determined,
  then the item will go to the guild bank pending further consideration.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">7. ALL items gained by family members will
be returned to the guild banker when the member no longer has use for it, except
for the NO DROP items acquired.</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">a) A family member will NOT sell such
  items, nor TRADE them for better items.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#989898" size="2" face="Gaelic">b) Family members who are found to have
  given away, traded, or sold items gained from a family event will be
  disciplined according to the rules stated in the Charter.</font></p>
