					Talks to the officers, to make sure there’s no objections to your application.
					Polls the guild, to make sure that you haven’t irritated someone so badly that

					If either of the above happen, then you will not be asked to raid with us until 
					whatever issues said member has with you, is resolved.  You may be the most skilled
					player ever, but if you’ve already offended someone in the guild too much to allow 
					them to raid with you without total angst, then you’d be problematic in the guild.
					If neither of the above occur, then you’ll receive a tell or e-mail saying that you

					Raid with us.  A lot.  At this point, the PoC becomes your best friend.  
					Talk to him/her on a daily basis, ask if raids are going on.  You can e-mail 
					her if you don’t see her online, or you can send a tell to your sponsor.  
					Don't be harassing random members of Vae to see what's going on - the regular 
					members probably can't tell you, and the officers have other things they need 
					to do - unless both your sponsor AND the PoC are not online.  That’s not their 
					job, they have other things to deal with - use the 
					PoC and your sponsor first and foremost.  Some things to remember:
					Not every raid we run is open.  You will not be invited to our North ToV raids, 
					nor some of our Luclin encounters, until you’ve spent sufficient time raiding 
					with us that we know you’re not going to do something foolish and cause a raid 
					wipeout.  We don’t expect you to keep track of these things - if the PoC says 
					you can’t come, you can’t.  If your sponsor says you can’t come, you can’t.  
					They’ve already asked if you’re allowed on this raid.  
					Not every raid is planned.  If we are having a night off, and suddenly, a mob 
					spawns that, for whatever reason, we dearly want to kill, you may find that you 
					get a tell out of nowhere, telling you to get to a certain area.  Pay attention!  
					Raid attendance is required on guild raids.  Meaning, if you’re online and you 
					are told to get to an area for a raid - you leave your group, your twink 
					powerlevelling, your auctions in gfaydark, and you get your butt to the raid 
					location.  If, for whatever reason, you cannot do this, explain your reasons to 
					the PoC (or your sponsor, if the PoC is not online).

					told.  If you decide that the high-level raiding game is not for you, simply 
					tell the PoC this.  It is not the way everyone prefers to play, and we’d rather 
					not have someone in the guild who is miserably unhappy doing the things we love to do.
