<br />
After a long dark night the sun finally shown through the thickly wooded area that was the Greater Faydark. High Elf wizards and mages came out to practice their craft, fighting bats and giant wasps with fireballs and ice bolts. To the North Wood Elves, Half Elves, Ogres, Trolls and all the other races of Norrath were all coming out of Crushbone. A place so abundant with orcs that your can’t go more than a minute without running into one, or five as many travel in packs. But no more east than west, just right in the middle of this massive forest lies a city by the name of Kelethin, home of the Wood Elves, birth of heroes great. The rays of sun that got through the thick trees now shown upon Lulerie’s face. Down ramps and onto a platform was how you traveled in this city, because it was different, different from others. This city was in the trees; and high up. Lulerie was going at a steady jog, trying to keep himself somewhat calm. Today was the day he had been yearning for. Today he would become an official Bard of Kelethin, or so he hoped. Across a rope bridge and to another platform and he was at his destination. The building where the Bard guild masters settled. Across another rope bridge he crossed and pushed open the door. He walked to the middle of the room and announced himself to the lady guild master in front of him.
<br />

<br />
   “Hail, I am Lulerie and I wish to be a Bard of Kelethin.”
<br />

<br />
   “Hail, and why would you wish such a thing upon yourself, young Lulerie?”
<br />

<br />
   “I wish to sing songs, to cure what ales my kindred. I wish to chant the battle songs of our ancestors, and I wish to follow my dream.”
<br />

<br />
   “And what is that?”
<br />

<br />
   “To sing to our beloved Tunare, mother of all.”
<br />

<br />
   “Well, Lulerie,” the guild master started, “you come to me and lay to me your hopes and dreams. How could I be one to deny you of them? Today you are a respected Bard of Kelethin.”
<br />

<br />
   Lulerie lost all feeling in his legs as his tunic and rusty short sword were laid before him.
<br />

<br />
   “Thank you, thank you very much,” Lulerie managed to get out. The guild master gave him a smile and a few parchments of paper, and Lulerie ran out the door and across the bridge to the platform. 
<br />

<br />
   He threw on the cloth tunic and sheathed his sword and began to look at the pieces of parchment that the guild master had given him. They were songs! Quickly he scribed them into his songbook and memorized the verses of them. He stepped onto the lift that would take him down to ground level. Another young wood elf came running just before Lulerie pressed down on the lever that would begin his decent to the ground. He was a ranger, but he had a helmet and gloves that were bright green.
<br />

<br />
   “How did you get those,” asked Lulerie.
<br />

<br />
   “My guild told me how to make these out of a few items here in the Faydwer.”
<br />

<br />
   “Wow, well safe travels to you,” Lulerie told the ranger, but he was already off. It was very quiet in Greater Faydark. Lulerie read one of the scrolls to himself:
<br />

<br />

<br />
                                       <span style="font-style: italic">Cords of Dissonance
<br />

<br />
                                          In singing this tune
<br />
                               All around you beings will cringe
<br />
                       This tune pains them from the inside out
<br />
                              Use it wisely and have no doubt</span>
<br />
   
<br />

<br />
   Lulerie was interrupted by soft footsteps that he barely heard, he looked up and they stopped. Looking around he couldn’t see anything, or anyone, just the normal trees and grassy hills. He looked back to his scroll and heard the strange footsteps run off to the east, to his right. He started to practice singing the Cords of Dissonance and soon it was second nature to him. He ventured over the hill that was at the foot of the ramp he was just on. He looked down and was amazed at what he saw; it was an open field filled with monsters of all sorts. There were giant wasps, bats, pixies, skeletons, and even a few drakelings. Drakelings were little winged lizards that were always found in forests.
<br />

<br />
   Lulerie raced down the hill and through the field, at the end he saw a skeleton that wasn’t looking in his direction. As he neared the walking dead he jumped off the side of a tree and tried to slash this skeleton from it’s right shoulder to his left hip, but he missed. The skeleton, now very aware that he was being attacked, turned around and took a swing at Lulerie, and landed the hit. A tiny scratch to his tunic was the only done. He decided that he better be more careful with his hits from now on. He adjusted his grip so that his right hand was at the end of the hilt of the sword and the tip was facing down. Up came the diagonal swipe of the sword, and a direct hit, right under the right arm socket and clear through to the other side of the neck. Lulerie sorted through the pile of bones with the tip of his sword, and managed to find a cloth wristband. 
<br />
  
<br />
 “OW!” Lulerie yelled, something hit him, and hit him hard. He turned around, expecting to see a young elf flailing about a sword in an attempt to hit a beast or some sort, but he was not so lucky. There was a group of bats, orcs, and giant wasps and they were furious. Then he remembered, he had been humming the Cords of Dissonance since he was on the platform, and he had probably made a few new enemies. Knowing that he had no chance he turned and ran as fast as he could in the other direction. He had to try and make it back to the lift; hopefully someone there would be able to help him. 
<br />
 
<br />
  “HELP! SOMEONE!” 
<br />

<br />
He looked towards the hill across the field, and thought he saw something move. Soon an array of sparks, blue and deep red of color appeared out of nowhere. They rose and scattered and soon Lulerie was moving faster, he felt the spirit of the wolf deep within him. He was easily able to outrun the monsters. Then a sudden whoosh went by the right side of his face, he thought it might be an arrow but it was moving impossibly fast. Lulerie turned to look and saw an array of green and yellow sparks infusing themselves into the beasts behind him and then small weeds and roots came up from the ground and grasped their feet. Then one of the bats let out a foul screech as it fell to the ground. “It must have been an arrow,” Lulerie thought to himself, and whoever was wielding the bow that shot it had some obvious skill. 
<br />
 
<br />
  He reached the top of the hill and looked to where he had seen the sparks. There stood a Wood Elf Ranger, clad in black chain mail. He had a composition bow held in his left hand and he was reaching into a quiver with his right, drawing out another arrow and notching it.
<br />

<br />
   “Are you alright,” the mysterious ranger asked in a deep voice that sounded distant thunder. 
<br />

<br />
   “Y-yes, I-I’m fine, Lulerie stuttered.
<br />

<br />
   “Good, head back to the lift and I shall see to you there,” letting the arrow fly, Lulerie herd a grunt from an orc and knew that another of his pursuers had fallen.
<br />

<br />
   Hoping that he wasn’t in too much trouble he started back and when he got to the lift he sat down and tried to mend his wounds. He looked up to see what the kind ranger was now doing. He had come to the other side of the hill and was slowly walking backwards, loosing arrow after arrow into the mass of monsters. 
<br />

<br />
   He then threw is bow to the ground and crossed his arms to his hips, right hand to the left hip and left hand to the right. Then out flew two intimidating swords; one had a long jagged edge and was tinted a deep red, this sword had seen a share of battles. The other sword that was in his left had was wide at the hilt; it grew slimmer in the middle and then out, forming a sort of half diamond at the end. The monsters, to Lulerie’s surprise, were still coming after him! He started to get up but then watched the ranger some more, in awe. Right, left, right, left went his swords, smiting each beast that they touched in one hit. It almost seemed as if there was no effort involved, that he was actually relaxed. When they had all taken their last breath the dark one sheathed his swords again and picked up his bow, and notched another arrow. Still watching in shock Lulerie could do nothing more than that: watch. He pulled back on the arrow as far as it would go and aimed, aimed at Lulerie’s head! He let go of the arrow and Lulerie watched it in slow motion as it flew closer and closer to head. He watched the arrow go left; he missed! Lulerie was still alive and the ranger had missed. He heard a grunt and looked back just in time to see an orc that was no more than five feet from him, club aloft, completing a complete flip backwards. 
<br />

<br />
   “You must pay closer attention to your surroundings young bard, I would hate to see one with such potential fall victim to one of these smelly orcs.”
<br />

<br />
   Lulerie looked back to the orc. The arrow had almost gone completely though the orcs head. The feathers that stabilized the wooden shaft had come in contact with the forehead of the orc. 
<br />

<br />
   “How did you-” but no one was there. He looked all around for signs of where the dark ranger might have been, or gone but he couldn’t see anything. Then he heard the same soft footsteps from when he was learning his songs. Then they ran off to the east, to his right, toward the hill.<br />_________________<br />May the river's current flow in your favor
