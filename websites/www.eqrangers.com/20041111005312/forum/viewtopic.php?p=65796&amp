				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">"I'm level &lt;number&gt;, where can I go to make plat in this game?" I hear this question over and over - on the boards and in game.  So, I have decided to do my best and answer =)  
<br />

<br />
Please remember most of this is from my own personal experience, so some of you may have better/different ideas!
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Staja's Guide to Making Plat!</span>
<br />

<br />
General rules for making Plat:
<br />
1. Making piles of plat will not happen instantly.
<br />
2. As you get higher level, it becomes much easier to make more money.
<br />
3. There is *much* more to the game than making money.
<br />
4. Tradeskillers will become your best friends.
<br />
5. I like pie. (hrm, that one's not really about making plat...ah, well  <img src="images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif" border="0" />)
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Foraging.</span>
<br />
Forage everywhere you go, every time it refreshes. You can get hundreds (literally) of different items needed by tradeskillers, and make thousands of plat. Never forget to forage.any zone you’re in, if you loot something that has a tradeskill flag, save it, someone on your server will want it.
<br />

<br />
Seriously - These are some good zones to forage in.  I did not list every zone and the forages from them, and on your server, the demand may vary.
<br />

<br />
Check out the foraging compendium here: <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/ceinwein/Foraging.htm" target="_blank">http://members.shaw.ca/ceinwein/Foraging.htm</a>
<br />

<br />
Any zone - Vegetables
<br />
East Karana - Tea Leaves/Plains Pebbles
<br />
Lesser Faydark - Sylvan Berries/Morning Dew
<br />
Thurgadin - Tufts of Dire Wolf Fur
<br />
Eastern Wastes - Tufts of Dire Wolf Fur
<br />
Wakening Lands - Yew Leaves
<br />
Plane of Growth - Branches of Planar Oak
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Sell your time/services.</span>
<br />
Example: Watch in nexus/bazaar ect for people wanting to buy items (Using myself as an example, I used to have an agreement with a level 30 druid that I'd pay them 50pp per stack of griffon feathers they collected, they'd save up a backpack, I'd pay them upon delivery.) 
<br />

<br />
Especially with people working on tradeskills that would rather spend money than time...You will become their new best friend. The above can be done with any sought after item. This may not be so easy to do sometimes, but you may have guildmembers that are always needing more of a certain item.  
<br />

<br />
Example 2: Rangers are wonderful trackers - in peak playing times, you may awnt to advertise yourself in a populated zone with a message like "Master tracker looking for work - can SoW, invis, and find what you're looking for!" (or something not as lame - it's your choice)  I have been asked many times to track epic and quest mobs for people - even druids =)  Also, it never ceases to amaze me that people will donate plat for SoW/ATK buffs/Lev, etc.  
<br />

<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Farming and Playing the Bazaar.</span>
<br />
Most of these tips and tactics work best for someone who is willing and able to set up a trader in the bazaar.  If you are unable to do so for whatever reason, you may be able to ask a friend or guildmember that you trust to sell some items for you, or auction items off in PoK or the Bazaar.
<br />

<br />
Well, we've already covered the forages you can sell, now it's on to the mob drops! Please keep in mind that all levels are approximate =D Some of the items I am listing can be sold as-is, but some of them may fetch a higher price if you done some basic sub-combines for trade-skillers.  That will be detailed in the next section.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">1 - 20ish:</span> Spiderling silks! These can either be sold on their own or saved for the next section.  Spiderling silks can be found in almost any newbie zone.  In Steamfont, there are 3 camps of Grikbar Kobolds.  These guys will not aggro and will give experience up to level 7.  They also drop vendorable hides and teeth (which are nice plat for the level of the mob) 
<br />
and Steamfont Springwater.  This can also be foraged in Steamfont is is sought after by high level tailors.  Save them, or hold on to them for the next section. Also Shadeweaver's Thicket has Lesser Shadows which can drop shadeling silk and Swirling Shadows.  The Swirling Shadows are sought after by high level smiths and you will want to hold on to the shadeling silk until the next section.  (The next section will be good, I promise!)  In Butcherblock Mountains, the goblin heads and bloods sell for up to 4pp/each!
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">20ish - 30ish:</span> Still in Shadeweaver's Thicket, you want to move on to the Shak Dratha.  They are the little, black alien looking guys.  They drop shade silk and Chunks of Condensed Shadows. The shade silk may not sell well, so you might want to hold on to it get up your tailoring.  The Chunks of COndensed Shadows are a pretty common drop and are very much sought after by high level fletchers.  On my server, they go for between 35-35pp/each.  Also, spiders in East Karana are doable for you, dropping up to 8 spider silks at once.  While there, you can kill lions for the MQ and HQ cat pelts and Griffons for their feathers.  All of these items may be sold in the bazaar or saved for the next section. If you've been looking for LDoN adventures, it may be worth your time to wait in Everfrost, where you can kill mammoths for the tusks and meat.  The tusks you can sell right to NPC merchants for 9pp or so and the meat is sellable in the bazaar. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">30ish - 45ish:</span>  MSeru hoppers drop Greyhopper and LQ hopper hides.  Frequently.  In all my exp groups there, no one has ever wanted to loot them.  The greyhopper hides can be used to get your tailoring up and the LQ hides will be used in the next section.  Also, the hoppers in DSP (not really sure on the level) can drop Flawless and Superb hopper hides which can sell for decent money to tailors.  The hill giants in Rathe Mountains are now doable, too.  They can drop up to 40pp and some FS weapons to sell.  Just be aware of aggro and try not steal someone else's kill - this is a very popular place to come.  SolA os nice, because the goblins often drop FS weapons are ore.  The weapons sell to vendors for 4-5pp/ea and the 
<br />
merchant is right in zone.  The large bricks of unrefined ore can be saved for a quest, if you wish (more on that later)
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">45ish - 55ish:</span>  Dulak's Harbor, Dranik Scar - both in groups, both have some very nice gem drops.  Also the guards in HHK drop some plat and FS weapons.  In Crystal Caverns, you can also start farming the Geonids (and the orcs, for velium).  The gems the geonids drop can sell for a fair amount of money and people always want velium.  Crystalline spider silk also drops there, too - this can be used to skill up on tailoring or to make Vials of Velium Vapors =)  Also, the Grimling Caves in TM are good for a couple of acrylia drops, as well as runes and gems that sell for a decent amount of money.  You can also kill the Grimling Runner for the Rallic Pack quest. Jaggedpine Forest - griffon meat, anaconda meat, plant shoots.  There is also a chance that a griff will drop Eye of the Griffon, a decent wisdom range slot item.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">55ish and up:</span> Acrylia Caverns.  This place is awesome, especially if you have Headshot.  Blocks of Acrylia sell for 31pp to vendors if you don't want to deal with bazaaring it.  The stackable acrylia runes sell for 2pp-6pp...each! And the weapons sell for about 150pp.  I like to being a friend who can gate, so they can run to the bank for us when our bags get 
<br />
too heavy =)  Also Droga is good because the goblins can drop up to 17pp/ea and there are a lot of nameds that can spawn.  CHoS/Light Vambraces of Deceit/Kingly Boots of Splendor.  Even if you bring a friend, you'll still be in good shape.  PoP mobs can drop gems like diamonds and BDs and vendor trash that sell for up to 75-90pp or so.  
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Tradeskills, the Bazaar, and Plat:</span>
<br />
If you have own the Gates of Discord expansion and have not yet done so, please go to Abysmal Sea and do the free tradeskill quests to get your skills over 54.  This is a *free* way to get your tradeskills over 54.  It will just take a little bit of time and and a little bit of clicking.  But it's *free*.  
<br />

<br />
Ok, now that your tradeskills are at least 54, you can start making sub-combines to sell to other players.  
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Leather Padding:</span> huge seller - 2 spiderling silks = silk thread + LQ wolf/bear/cat pelt or hopper hide *or* 2 shadeling silk = shadeling silk thread + LQ hopper hide. These sell for 30-45pp/ea on my server.  I sold these all thought my youth and even now if I'm bored, I'll whip up a stack or 2 to sell.  
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Celetial Essence:</span> celetial solvet + scent of Marr in a mixing bowl - both purchaseble in PoK.  There is a slow and steady market for them.  
<br />
Heady Kiolas: 2 kiola saps, a flask of water and a bottle.  These sell for aboud 5pp/ea.  Some tailors don't want to have to do all that extra clicking themselves =)
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Dyes:</span> Remember all those Steamfont Spring waters you had? You can make them into dyes.  Or plant shoots, sylvan berries, etc.  EQTraders.com, the number one tradeskiller's website has 
<br />
a ton of information about the dyes and tempers you can make with foraged items.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Vendor-Mining.</span>
<br />
I have a habit of checking all the vendors in the Bazaar, PoK, and PoTranquilty to see if anybody has sold anything interesting to them.  On a lot of tradeskill items (and even some gear), the NPC merchant price will be lower than the PC prices.  In Abysmal Sea, I have found 3 pieces of Raw Shimmering Nihilite and 1 piece of Raw Shimmering Ore.  I then gave 
<br />
these to the correct NPC to refine them, got 2 of each substance back, and then sold each refined substance for ~5000pp/each.  Not too shabby for a 24pp investment.  I always buy any spider/ling silks I find, as I know I can re-sell them for higher.  I have also been able to find some Kunark-era clicky armour.  You need to make sure the items will sell on your 
<br />
server, though.  I was able to sell my warrior-clicky gloves in 30 minutes, but I've had my rogue-clicky boots on my trader for awhile now.  Vendor-mining can be tricky and costly. You have to be *very* aware of what could re-sell and what is a good deal.  Also, invest in a pair of opal-encrusted steins to raise your charisma 50 points and get you better prices.  Persistence *will* pay off.  I have found items like Knotted Turtlebone Rings for 125pp/ea, stacks of Sacred Tunare Silk, Metallic Liquids, etc.  I once even heard of someone finding an Amulet of Necropotence on a vendor for 525pp.  
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Quests for Items to Sell and Plat.</span>
<br />
The Shield of Bane Warding can be soloed/duoed at high levels and sells for a decent amount of plat - it is a +20 wis shield.  Also, the rallic pack quest is pretty easy - the Grimling Runner paths right by the 1st grimling tunnel in TM.  His spawn time is 90 minutes and then it's just a short hop to Katta to finish up.  Just a note, the Rallic Pack is Lore.  Also, if you looted any Unrefined Ore during your time in SolA, you can so the 'restocking ore' quest.  I always do mine in the bazaar.  You need to hail the gnome smithing vendor and he will give you a box for either 4 large bricks or 4 small bricks.  Turning in 4 large bricks gets you 44pp.  Another quest that I have done to sell the end result is for the Harvester.  this is a necro-only item, but the quest is pretty easy.  It is one of the Temple of Sol Ro quests.  I have been able to sell this item for up to 500pp for not a lot of effort.  <a href="http://www.allakhazam.com" target="_blank">http://www.allakhazam.com</a> is a wonderful site detailing all sorts of quests =)
<br />

<br />

<br />
I have my forage set up on a macro key which helps tons..basically I am ALWAYS foraging that way.
<br />

<br />
In your socials do the following:
<br />

<br />
Line 1 /doability 1 (or whatever ability your forage is)
<br />
Line 2 /pause 8
<br />
Line 3 /autoinventory
<br />

<br />
I then have this button on one of my hot keys set to the Right arrow (look in keyboard options under 'macros').  Every time I turn right I forage and the forage goes automatically in my inventory.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for the guide Staja.  It's awesome.<br />_________________<br /><img src="http://www.jennawhitman.com/everquest/woodsig.jpg"></span><span class="gentblsmall"></span></td>
