<em>Talk to Gaudric Stormwynd in Gulf of Gunthak and he'll tell you that he needs a captured nifilik and a tiny nifilik, which are dropped items from the insects “Broken Rock Nifilik”. They are found on the beach across the water. If you swim to your left looking at the lighthouse from the boat, you will find the beach. The nifilik's were light blue and green to a lvl 50 ranger. Good luck, took a while to get both components ~ Ranyart (Tarrew Marr Server)</em><br>

<em>Gaudric Stormwynd says 'Greetings, Lenasan. What brings you to this forsaken rock? I have been sent here by the council of Surefall Glade to gather information about this Island. This place seethes with anger and hatred, and even the familiar [winds] of Karana blow with a cold bite. So far the creatures have all proved very hostile, even to a follow of Karana. I suspect that the curse of Innoruuk has caused them be very aggressive towards all outsiders. I have been able to gather some information on a new race of [insect] though'</em> <br>
<br>
You say, 'what winds' <br>
<br>
<em>Gaudric Stormwynd says 'The fury of a truly torrential storm is a beautiful thing. Even in their destruction they bring the birth of new life. Such is the cycle of life on Norrath, from the ashes nature always rebuilds. The trolls care nothing for this cycle though, and merely use the power of the storm to fill their treasuries. I hear the tormented cries of tempest [spirits] across the wind.'</em> <br>
<br>
You say, 'what spirits' <br>
<br>
<em>Gaudric Stormwynd says 'I believe the followers of Nadox have found a way to control the spirits of the tempest by capturing them in amulets made of the black rock from the island. Bring me one of their amulets and I may be able to free the spirit from it.'</em> <br>
<br>
Loot a glowing zraxthil amulet off of random A Broken Skull Adherants in the Crypt of Nadox and bring it back. <br>
