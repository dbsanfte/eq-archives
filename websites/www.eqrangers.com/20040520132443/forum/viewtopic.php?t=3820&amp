<br />
     Menas was approaching the Tunarean Forest just before daybreak.  A soft mist filled the autumn air and a thick layer of  fog still clung to the ground.  The air was brisk and puffs of heated air billowed from the winded Ranger as he bent over his hands on his knees.  Around his right hand was wrapped a platinum necklace with a dark green jewel.  The forest in front of him shown thru the mist to be a mature wood in its autumn colors of reds, oranges and browns.  His soft leather boots kicked through the thick brown knee high grass and were slicked with early morning dew.  Menas paused for a moment to look back at the Velious Mountains challenging the skyline behind him, snow clung to the jagged mountain range in raggedy patches, and small wisps of clouds slithered from peak to craggy peak.  The summit was haloed by a deep plum colored sky with shimmering golden fingers stretching out from the mountain.
<br />
Menas could tell the sun was very close to eclipsing the summit.  He had ridden his horse hard for three days and nights until it could go no further.  Then a day ago he had to rest the animal so he ran the rest of the way on foot.  He was exhausted but it had paid off, he had arrived before daybreak on the Autumnal solstice.  Just then the sun crested the top of the summit and in a flash it&#8217;s light slashed across the sky.  
<br />
Menas quickly held up the amulet to the light.  The sun hit the gem and the light splintered into a myriad of green beams.  The gem started to hum and spin on its chain, the beams of light whirling around shooting off in every direction. A thunderclap rolled across the sky as the green light arced horizontally from the amulet and faded into the distance.  The flash from the gem was so bright Menas rubbed his eyes and blinked, he didn&#8217;t know what to expect, but he didn&#8217;t expect such dramatics.  Before he was able to see clearly again he could feel a difference in the air, it seemed &#8220;alive&#8221;.  Everywhere he looked he saw a golden apricot hue, it clung to the mist that hung in the air it seemed almost liquid swirling into airborne whirlpools and flowing with the light breeze.  Menas heard the sounds of tiny bells or chimes behind him, turning to see what it was he was awe struck at the sight of the forest, it was the most beautiful sight he had ever witnessed.  It was as if the gem had awoken the forest from its autumn slumber, with the morning suns help of course.  Flowers were everywhere, in a multitude of colors; summer sky blue, and emerald ocean greens and soft golden sunlight yellows.  Butterflies sprung from the ground flittering from flower to flower enjoying their nectar.  Birds were singing the greeting of the sunlight as they flew overhead and jumped from green leafed tree branch to tree branch.  
<br />
A snapping twig brought Menas&#8217;s head around to his right with a start.  His eyes narrowed and his bow was quickly in his hand his other hand moving toward the quiver on his back.  He looked into the forest.  Through the patchwork of leaves the sun streaked like bars of gold stabbing the forest floor.  Amongst the bars Menas made out a murky shadow, picking its way around the patches of sunlight.  As it grew closer it started to take on some shape.  Menas crouched to one knee, drawing his arrow to his cheek, he waited.  The silhouette stopped, the silhouette look almost like a horse, but too skinny and it had large antlers, Menas remembered stories told around campfires of  an elusive animal of the woods a Nightforest Elk.  The Nightforest Elk are partly magical beings akin to a unicorn.  They are a dark tan green during the day, and at night their coats turn black as midnight.  His antlers were dark green and pointed at the ends unlike a regular Elk.  Menas lowered his bow, slowly releasing the pressure on the string, and stood.  The Elk broke the tree line nibbling at the tall grasses of the field.  It was massive for an Elk, it&#8217;s strong build and grace was evident with each step.  Lifting its head it looked directly at Menas, sniffed the air then cocked its head to one side giving a quizzical look.  The Elk then turned slowly and headed back towards the woods, stopping briefly it looked back over its shoulder at Menas then trotted into the forest.  What a beautiful creature Menas thought, I hope all within the wood are as docile as he was. 
<br />
Menas knew it was the moment of truth, he was about to enter the legendary Tunarean woods if he was found unworthy, he would come under attack by the denizens of the woods.  He said a prayer of thanks to Tunare for all he has been given and seen, then with a sigh he returned his helmet to his head and stepped into the forest.  He stood there and looked around, no elements of nature attacked him.  He hopped that his luck would hold then continued on his way.  
<br />
The forest floor was littered with old leaves that crunched beneath his weight.  The forest was just as alive in the interior as it was in the exterior, birds jumped from branch to branch as squirrels scampered after each other along the forest floor.  The trees had a thick canopy of branches with leaves in every green hue.  The leaves jostled in the slight breeze creating a soft murmur.   Menas started to jog, slowly increasing his speed to a full out run as he sped deeper into the woods.  Menas noted that the size of the trees was steadily increasing.  The trees on the outer rim of the forest were younger trees perhaps a hundred years old.  As the trees size grew so did their age Menas estimated the trees with trunks as large around as a deer and as tall as 100 Elves were 300 years old.  He paused next to one of these trees and pulled an old faded parchment out of his belt pouch.  The map showed the Tunarean Forests position by the Velius mountains.  In the middle of the forest there was a lake and in the middle of that lake was a small island with a large tree marked with the words &#8220;Woods Heart&#8221;.  Near the lake was written something that wasn&#8217;t legible.  Menas never found any information to help him figure out what was written there so long ago.  He didn&#8217;t have time to worry about it though he was pressed for time.  The map was no real use as far as giving a correct distance that Menas could make out.  The direction was the most important thing.  He hoped he didn&#8217;t have much further to go as he shoved the map back in its pouch.  The sun had now eclipsed its highest peek and was on its way down.  The shadows were starting to grown longer and Menas knew the hour was getting late he had to be at the lake before the sun set.  Menas pushed himself off the tree, and began running again.  He didn&#8217;t get far when he &#8220;felt&#8221; something<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=769394" target="_blank" class="postlink">Menas Darkenwood</a>

Well written, liked it alot...reminded me os the Shannara series of books by Terry Brooks...
<br />

<br />
Add a line or two about letting your trusty steed stay outside the Forest, saying goodbye to it, for now. Let it roam...something like that. (I had a brief innermind question about what happened to your horse when u went into the forest)
<br />

<br />
Loved the bit about the map.(maybe add a inkling about where/how u got it...from the quest u did in velious in the Wurm cave...
<br />

<br />
But all those are just fillers to beef up a really good tale. Good little chapter there u got started. /salute<br />_________________<br />Lemba  Nameless

Hopefully you'll continue on and flesh it out.  Now some technical issues???  Just some things that really stood out because they broke up the 'flow'.
<br />

<br />
'raggedy'??  ..errmm
<br />

<br />

<br />
"...the sun was very close to eclipsing the summit.'
<br />
I'll attribute that to writing style.   <img src="images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
"He hopped that his luck...."   'hopped' should be hoped
<br />

<br />
"The sun had now eclipsed its highest peek and was now on its way down.
<br />

<br />
'peek' should be peak
<br />

<br />
'eclipsed' is used incorrectly here... unless the sun rose higher today than it has ever risen before.
<br />
Eclipse means to hide, conceal, obscure, cover or alternatively to surpass as in:
<br />
Robin always remained the sidekick because his skills were eclipsed by Batman's greater prowess.
<br />

<br />
"The shadows were starting to grown longer...."  I presume this should be 'grow'.  Of course, we may be in a magical realm and it's meant to read:  The shadows were starting to groan longer.....      <img src="images/smiles/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
 There were some grammatical errors as well but, hey, that's style too.  <img src="images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif" border="0" />
<br />
I really hope that you don't take this as being critical:  definitely not my intent.  Keep up the good work.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=620907" target="_blank" class="postlink">
