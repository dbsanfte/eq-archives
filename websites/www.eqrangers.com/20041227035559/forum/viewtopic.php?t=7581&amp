				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Now Rut's our hero by all accounts had led a pretty sheltered life and could not have been considered as a "Wild Child" by any means.
<br />

<br />
He'd done the usual of trying to sneak into the SureFall Arms underage with his mates, casually sauntering up to the bar and in a deep growly manly voice ordering a round of Gnomish Spirits and promptly receiving a good clip round the ear from the wise Troll Bartender(?) and being promptly ejected onto his arse out into the street.  So when some of his friends and whispered about the opportunity of getting high one evening, well Ruts just couldn't contain himself!!  He had heard many stories of the local Drood Biker Gang doing weird things to the local plant life and was wondering what was going to be involved.  There had been horror stories of having to lick the back of frogs over in the Plane of Storms and ending up with them being stuck to the tongue for ever more but Ruts was sure his Faction Issue friends would know what they were doing!
<br />

<br />
The evening came, and on the pretext of going out to the weekly crochet class Ruts hot footed down to Dogle's and met up with his friends.  There he met Grokl the Wizzy frog who said they had to get into a group, so Ruts dutifully did along with Nichee, Laurienne, Cinnic and Ecantor.  Now at this point Ruts started to get a big concerned as a weird image of the five of them sitting on Dogles steps with Grokl getting his shirt off and then crowding around behind him rose into his over creative mind!! all the saliva drained out of his mouth and Ruts hurriedly looked about for any wandering Guardians who would take a dim view of this sort of group interaction.  But it wasn't to be.........POW!!!! :eek 
<br />

<br />
After the vomiting effects of the port had worn off Rut's found himself on a weird island and finding it very hard to breath due to the lack of oxygen.  With a quick look over the edge Rut's sat back down on the floor with a thump and lost his earlier supper in a pool beside him.  Getting to about 15,000 feet up in the air was not what he had in mind when told about getting high! After absent mindely wondering why there was always carrot chunks and tomato skins in vomit when one couldn't ever remember eating them for ages, the rest of the FI crew arrived courtesy of Grokl's Cabs.  With a white complexion and not feeling very well at all Ruts staggered back to the group. <img src="images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
As he tried to get himself together the evening just turned a lot worse with an authoritative voice ringing out saying, "OK Ruts, go off to the those hovering Pixie like chicks, give her a slap then come over here and die"  Now at this point Ruts really was wondering the probability survival rate of hitting water after jumping from 15,000 feet up but it was soon explained how the progression of the Plane of Sky worked if one didn't have the necessary keys and needed to be summoned to the different islands.  Rut dutifully took out his blade and gently prodded the floating Faerie whilst apologising under his breath and it wasn't long before Ruts was shivering, freezing cold and semi naked pack in POK.
<br />

<br />
With a quick rez and courtesy summon from Kikur, Rut's found himself on the island of the mighty great steeds aka Pegasus.
<br />
Now these beasts were magnificent with their huge white beating wings and flowing manes, however Elladon the resident Warrior was having nothing of that and with a great cry launched into battle.  It soon became apparent that there was a certain hazard when slaying these beasts which Elladon found out very quickly.  Just at the point of death the horses seemed to lose control of their bodily functions, and as they attacked by hovering 10 feet above everyone, whoever was directly below sort of copped the fall out.  It wasn't long before Elladon found himself with a mystical empty radius around him where no one else from the raid would approach due to the smell and the state of his not so shiny armour.
<br />

<br />
With furious looting for the key items required, the Great Steed Of Them All finally spawned (aka Collector of Souls) and was duly slain. Then this little dude appeared hovering above the corpse.  Now this guy was seriously certifiable, ranting and raving and Ruts looked around for the men in white coats who were coming to take him away.  However reaching up on his tippy toes he passed over the necessary pieces and was awarded a key for the next isle, that of Spiroc Island. 
<br />

<br />
The big birdies on this island again fought like their brothers on Pegasus and it wasn't long before Elladon was again covered in their final gifts.  The killing of the Guardian and Lord again produced the raving loony little dude and it was off to the island of Bzzazzt.  Now this is where it became a little tougher with a few of the group getting stung to death and the rest bravely keeping it together while the little Bixies came.  Now these were toughies as it was hard to keep looking up at a 45 degree angle to attack as well as keeping an eye on who needed help etc.  It wasn't long before many party members were walking around with their heads in funny positions due to looking up into the sky all the time.  It was then that Rut's took a photo opportunity of out guest speaker for the evening, Morghan Ansgar of Phoenix Paragon, who like Rut's had also heard there was a chance to get high, but for all the wrong reasons.
<br />

<br />
From there was a port over to Drake Island with lots of birds flapping back and forth.  Rut's decided to name this the lottery island.  The reason being, when battle commenced every now and then a huge booming voice would ring out "ITS YOU!!!!" and a massive shimmering hand would float down from the heavens and an index finger would point to one of our brethren.  However instead of winning copious amounts of plat like back at home, the unlucky recipient would drop dead from the random death touch.  When we lost our brave clerics it was decided that we would return at a later date and defeat this island.
<br />

<br />
Not all was lost, as many members were keyed, several had drops for their epics and a few nice bits of loot were obtained.  With a resounding cry of "BANZAI" Ruts observed the raid taking running leaps off the edge and so dutifully followed.  Once he had managed to stagger to the shores of Freeport everybody met back at Dogles for the usual tea and medals.
