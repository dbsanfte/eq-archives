				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Dark clouds gathered and raced across the sky at a supernatural speed. A bright flash of lightning danced behind the clouds, tracing its uncertain path over head, followed by a resounding report of thunder.
<br />
     Then the rain came, in white sheets, blanketing the whole of the land. Dumping its life giving power onto thousands of dead trees, and miles of parched earth. But it didn’t matter, nothing would grow here, a plague of evil had swept through the world, factions had changed and old allies were now bitter enemies.
<br />
       Once enormous ancient trunks, rich with life and thick dark bark laying on it, had long since withered into dead apparitions of their former self. The dozens of platforms and ramps that were cleverly hidden atop the trees had fallen into disrepair. A few burnt down, others laying on the ground below.
<br />
       Standing on the edge of one of these platforms was a shrouded figure, cloaked in shadow and lost in thought. He unconsciously rubbed an amulet that hung around his neck, a small impression had been burrowed into it from years of similar abuse. Thunder sounded once more and he jerked around, emerald eyes peering suspiciously at the few figures that wandered the trashed alleyways of Kelethin.
<br />

<br />
                               (flashback)
<br />

<br />
        A menacing Teir'Dal stormed into a dimly lit room, books were stacked on shelves and some littered the floor. In the center was a table, scores of rolls and parchment lay scattered on it, laying on top of them was a behemoth of a staff, which could easily pass for charred wood. A soft cool breeze blew in from a balcony, bringing in the sweet alluring smell of summer nights. In front of an empty fireplace was a large velvet chair, which the dark elf approached cautiously, stepping in view of another elf.
<br />
        Two bloodshot eyes poured over a large book, with ancient pages made of stretched and dried Feir’Dal skin. There were black belts from lack of sleep under his eyes, but they barely stood out next to his blue skin. Tangled hair fell over his shoulders and he seemed not to notice the figure standing in front of him.
<br />
	“Tyrin,”  the other dark elf had a surprisingly dark and deep voice that commanded obediance from those that stood before him. He slid into a chair leaning forward, staring intently at his brother.
<br />
    His head snapped up and he stared dazedly back before he came to his senses, he shook his head and snapped the book shut, sticking it hastily into a pouch in his cloak. He held a calculating, sophisticated leer on his face, and had his lip turned slightly up, as if the elf before him stunk. “What,“  he stated, staring at his brother with both mutual interest and furtive boredom.
<br />
“You know what I want,” he hissed, anger clouding his eyes.
<br />
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Tyrin said in a carefree voice, chuckling afterwards, a dangerous twinkle coming to light in his eyes.
<br />
“The book,” he paused looking his brother over, noting the bedraggled way he held himself “How much have you read?” a hint of urgency reverbrating under the surface.
<br />
	“I finished it…”
<br />
The other elf scoffed, sneering down his nose, “Ha! And you’re still alive and sane?”
<br />
	“What do you expect, after all, I am Innuroks chosen one.”
<br />
	“Brother…” this time worry laced his voice, giving it a soft edge, cautiously he laid his hand on his brothers shoulder, who jerked sharply away, “You need to rest,” he said, looking earnestly into his brothers face.
<br />
	Tyrin’s eyes narrowed, he stood up, gatherhing his robes about him, he seemed several feet taller and the unearthly glow in his eyes sent a shiver down the other Teir’Dals spine. “You!” he spat out venomously, “You, my brother King Nazrah of the Teir’Dal, think I’m insane too…like all the others,” he trailed off, his eyes glazing over, lost in thought before he returned to glaring down his brother. The charred staff that was laying on the table earlier appeared in his hands, and to the best Nazrah could explain, began to absorb, and emit darkness from and into the room. He now stood up also, nervously he fingered the pommel of hise sword.
<br />
	“Tyrin, I order you, burn it.”
<br />
	“I’ll never do it, just read a page, a paragraph…you’ll understand, you don’t know how primitive the best of our necromancers magic is, next to this, they, you, even I was nothing.
<br />
	As good at controlling his emotions  he was, Nazrah couldn’t fight the urge to beat the lifeblood out of his brother, he drew his epic, slamming it into Tyrin’s skull with the flatside, sending him sprawling into a stack of books. Casually the injured elf picked himself up, wiping off the trail of  blood that oozed from his temple.
<br />
	“Far to long you’ve stood in my way, far, far, too long i've watched you lead my people. resign your position of king to me, and I’ll let you die quickly,” The calmness in his voice betrayed the turmoil raging in his eyes, and his left hand twitched continuously, the staff hung limply in the other.
<br />
	“You really are insane,” Nazrah gasped, looking shocked at his brother, who had begun to drift across the room, the fatigue that was so evident earlier was now gone.
<br />
	“I’ll kill you first Ty…” but that’s as far as he got, a black fog shot from his brothers hands, Nazrah swung at it with his sword but it only past through, not even disturbing it. His body went to a cold dumb numb as it wrapped around him, he could feel every nerve in his body screaming in protest, like someone had stuck a splinter into them, lighting it on fire. He clutched his chest, letting his sword clatter to the floor, willing his body to throw off whatever magic his brother had wrought. Slowly he could feel again, he looked down at his hands to make sure they were there, when he did fear caught his heart like a vicegrip. A smooth light brown pigment had been borne onto him, his sight weakened, only slightly, but enough to be noticed, but his sense of smell seemed to be at a peak. Then it hit him what had happened, he roared and lunged futily at his brother who side stepped easily. Clutching his sword to his chest, for the first time in his one hundred years he cried, falling to his knees. A hopeless keen was emitted that sounded unnatural coming from his evil frame, and choked sobs began to violently wrack his body. He was dimly aware of a cackle coming from where Tyrin was standing, and something about the irony of the situation was said between giggles.
<br />
	“What have you done?” he hissed violently, but got no answer, “WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME!?” he roared standing up looking at his brother.
<br />
	“It doesn’t matter, you’re cursed until I die, now leave, before I let the guards know there’s an assassin in my studyroom.”
<br />
                "Please...kill me"
<br />
                At this his brother fell into a bout of laughter, "I never thought i'd see the day, no, you'd enjoy that wouldnt you? You'll live, i'll make damn sure of it, how does it feel? becoming what you loathe, please, you must tell me."
<br />
	“I’ll be back,” the tormented elf vowed, stumbling backwards feeling his way to the balcony. He wouldnt dare take his eyes off of him. he turned and lept off, disparingly, he made his way to the only place where he could be excepted.
<br />
               "No, you wont," he stopped, he wasnt for sure if he heard it at all, he knew it wasnt his brother, the voice was unearthly, and he felt the urge to sprint away in fear, he peered into the darkness, but to no avail, warily he turned and continued onward.
<br />
	
<br />

<br />

<br />
Nazrah came back to his senses, glaring into the two green eyes that reflected from his sword. He cursed and spat at them, shoving his sword back into the scabbard, a wood elf carrying the shadowknight epic would draw attention, especially in these times. He contemplated jumping, and letting himself fall, the shame of becoming what he hated with every fibre of his being was nearly too much to bare. No it was too much, far to much. But he wouldn’t, a century growing up in the cruel culture of his people had molded him to well for that. He didn’t know how he would go about it, but he would kill his brother and reclaim his throne. He was supposed to be the one causing the havoc that he now suffered from, he was supposed to destroy the Feir’Dal, and his brother was making quick to do that, he knew they couldn’t hold out much longer, the hordes of netherworld beasts that had been summoned to serve his brother , now king of his people, would continue to come in un-relentless waves. He would give them what help he could, but only so he could give the coupe de grace. He walked into an alley and laid down on a discarded robe wrapping his cloak tightly about him, warding off the cold. Sleep took him soon, dreams of revenge and the lust to kill comforted him.
