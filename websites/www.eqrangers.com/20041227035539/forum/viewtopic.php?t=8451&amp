<br />

<br />
                       &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Chapter 1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;	
<br />

<br />
	I'd first met you, in a tavern at Del'Rithna. I'd slowly wandered there, my life, my power, and my will to live, all slowly diminishing, you were an unseen face, fleeing the same thing as I.  I remember seeing you burst in the door,  calm yourself, energy bleached hair, i could have spotted a mile away that you were a mage, but i did not sense and power aurating off of you. You asked the bartender for a room, you wanted to stay the night, and BAM, it hit me, a mass of demonic energy as i had not felt since i left the council of Delirics, and you seemed to wince at the same time i was struck with shock. 
<br />

<br />
 				( Falls completely into Flashback ) 
<br />
	 
<br />
	I stood up and walked over to approach you, your head instantly slammed in my direction, your eyes glazed over for a moment and you muttered a quick word, and said " You shall not take me Deliric " 
<br />
I was stunned i didn't not know what to say, or even think, this MORTAL knew my ancient name, knew the name that no mortal should know, the name, of the once renowned High Deliric of the Council. How could a mortal. My thoughts were suddenly jarred from me as the door to the inn opened and someone i never wanted to see again, came into the room. My apprentice, my son, and my old partner, Zrae'lik Fraion, the second Deliric, of the High Council of Demons, there will never be a being, more wretched than he. He, obviously knew exactly who i was. He let loose a joyful cackle that said all the need to be said, and let loose a jet of raw Aikala energy. Being his father i knew he would try the most straightforward attack, so i simply threw up a Drizzala guard spell and feigned to the right and shot for the left, Feral unsheated and poised in my grasp, ready to taste the flesh of one who murdered the 2 closest to me , although his abrupt use of white magic stopped me midair, frozen in place, not able to move a muscle at all.
<br />
	
<br />
 	As i laid there, hanging in midair, i took a moment to size up my surroundings, all the customers had vacated, the wizard gone of course, and a hole in the ground where i was standing, still growing in size from the burst of Aikala energy. Then, he spoke, " So Father, i chase that pidiful wizard here to regain what is rightfully mine and i get you instead -hideous cackle- well, just as well, i can return you to Yovolcavark for a quite a magical enhancement. Although i bet ure wondering why i'm chasing something as pidiful as a human? well wonder on, im not going to tell you ....." He continues on, i don't listen, because in the span of about .8 seconds a vision hits me, explaining how to escape, i've never been one to trust ||censored|| like that, but never look a gift horse in the mouth. Re-living the vision, I began to form a small ball of energy around the back of my hand, painfully, i concentrated it into the smallest form possible, and with the flick of a wrist, flung it out of the window, and  just like the vision, there was a cracked beer cask agained the window which exploded, shattering Zrae's concentration, and abruptly dropping me to the floor, where as i abruptly, dissapeared. I went through the window that exploded, jumped up onto the roof of the neighboring tavern, and jump 30 into the window of the Royal Mansion Attic. and right into the Wizard, who instantly paralyzed me with another spell ( this ||censored|| getting old ). and put me to sleep.
<br />

<br />
	When i woke, it was nightime, barely enuff light to see, and i was in a barn ? wtf ? i weakly tried to sit up but couldn't i'd been weakened somehow, i let loose a deep gutteral growl that only a demon such as i could produce, i heard the horses in stalls neigh and rear , trying to escape, and cows mooing for release. " Quite that! " someone said to me, and then i realize my eyes were closed, and shook my head, a wet cloth slid down the side of my face, and the Wizard was standing over me. I glared at him for atleast 10 minutes, before either of us said anything. " You might as well get comfy because i don't plan on releasing you, until i figure out who you are or why Zrae attacked you." Realizing it was simple spell bonds holding me weak, and stationary, i flexed my demonic powers just enuff to shatter the bonds WITH the wizard knowing about it, i instantly regained my strength  and stood shakily, the wizard was visibly shaken, and or scared? " Relax, i won't hurt you, mortal" the last word was said with enuff intensity to start a war, as if the word shared the meaning of every offensive thing ever said. He simply looked at me, and managed to sprout a modest, maybe defiant stare. " What's your name human? " " Daroonia, you may not know my last name, but call me Dragod" " Well Dragod, YOU better sit and get comfy, because i want to know why my son was chasing you, and what you have that he claims is his" and at this, i gave one my deepest smiles, sliding into my demonic form slowly, doing this previously has literally scared the ||censored|| out of people, seems to have that effect from my eyes turning dark blood red, fangs the size of pinkies growing from my jaw and the blackest of auras emanating from my body. Although if i wasn't armored at the time, the bodily changes that took place would kill people from sheer fright, Dragod wasn't moved at all by this tho, as if he'd seen it before, to save face i moved to full demon form and slept like that, claiming i slept better that way. There was more to this Mortal than meets the eye.

  					&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Chapter 2&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />
				        &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Trial of Bloodlust &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
	Morning came swiftly, as if i had not slept but a moment.  I wearily stumbled to my feet, the sudden urge of demonic energy used the previous night had struck me with what most mortals would call a " hangover".   I took a look around and spotted my query, the door, i walked over and stepped through the wooden portal out into the barren farmland, the wizard must have taken me quite a bit, i couldn't sense intelliegent lifeforms <if you could call it that> thought for at least a few miles.  I extended my wings and gave a powerful beat, stretching them after a few decades of neglect, if things went as i thought, they'd be getting a bit of work, and i decided to excerise them. I stood in place using my wings to slowly hover in mid-air, with black ashenbone and reddish purple hide wings, beating slowly up, and down, magic in the starting to take effect, muscle usage continually becoming un-needed, as my magic slowly sloshed back into them, when i felt as if they were strong enuff to sustain my muscle form in mid air. I retracted my wings and then re-extended them a few times. Suddenly, as if escaping some hidden force attacking me, i jumped back, rolled to the right, jumped diagonally against the barn and pivoted mid air so i  was facing the ground, then extended my wings and instantaniously leaped into full-flight and speared toward the flaming sun as if to attack it.  The Wizard came rushing out of the barn-door, wickedly bladed dagger , held as if to strike like a cobra, held poised and ready, seeming to draw my sight.... i literally could NOT draw my sight from the blade, i transverted to mage-sight and the blade was generating the most powerful demonic aura i'd ever seen, and i instantly knew what it was. Who better to recognize a blade of such fine craftsmanship, than the maker of said blade? I now knew what Zrae was after.... the dagger i had forged and used to sacrifice the Angel-King of the Human God, one man called Gabriel, i'd spent decades tracking him down and slaying his followers, only to sacrifice him in vain efforts, as I was righteously outcasted by my bretheren, the ones who I had put in power, the ones i had raised from demon hatchlings. The Wizard merely said "Must you be so infernally loud demon? " 
<br />
	" Would rather i be weak as a human or Full demonic powers when Zrae follows?"
<br />
	" How would he follow? i gated us at last 50 leagues away"
<br />
	At the mere thought that Zrae couldn't follow something with MY lifeforce and aura emanating, was insidiously hilarious. I laughed, quite hard.
<br />
	Dragod stared hard at me, as my body shook with mirth, he scowled and merely stated,  “ Would you mind elaborating on what you find so humorous?”
<br />
	I turned my face toward him, smirked and raised my eyebrow a trifle, bold arrogance flowing from my posture, I slowly explained to him, that a child of my blood, not being able to track the demonic presence of their kin, was sheer absurdity. He scowled and walked back into the barn, slamming the portal-like doors on the way in. I followed, pushing the doors open with a sheer testament of my will. I didn’t even bother moving my feet, I set my wings to a quiet hum as they slowly beat, hovering behind the mage, I strafed a quick circle around him so as to hover 2 feet in front of him as he moved. He stopped by the stall with his pack, and reached down and pulled out a small pouch, chanted a few words, and reached his hand down to the shoulder into it and pulled out a large book that proportionally should not  have fit. He flipped thru about 50 pages until he got to a page with blurred words and a picture of a minor demon being cast into shadows. He began a slow incantation without offering me any explanation, I followed his words and the writing in the book, a few words from the end of the chanting, a small, but deadly bolt of precision Aikala energy, shot through the wall, I threw myself forward with all the speed I could muster from a half-regenerated demon body and slammed into Dragod, nearly throwing him thru the barn-door, but taking the bolt to the thigh. Intense, cold, numbing pain that I had thought I’d never feel again, ran up my leg, into my spine, and penetrated my very conscience, As an afterthought, I never could figure out how a simple bolt of such energy, could cause such great pain, yet numb the bodies’ every other senses and cause minor paralyzation, simple laws determines that one effect would cancel the other, but leave it to the demonic race to develop a weapon that brings numbness to all senses, extreme pain and paralysis.
<br />
	“ So you thought you could hide did you Father? “ 
<br />
 A simple word from Dragod encompassed me and him in glowing green orbs. Zrae projected a dozen or so bolts of Aikala energy at me and as they hit I felt a rush of energy flowing back into me, I cast an arrogant smile at Dragod and found him with a similar arrogant smirk displayed on his face. Zrae snarled, and rushed towards me, drawing blade halfway, his blade met nothing but air when he reached me, I was already behind him, Feralblade drawn and ready, already moving to pierce Zrae’s ribs, the blade met only warm steel of demonic forge, and drawn by the rage that was Feralblade, the blade of my alter mind, grew a inches and plunged again, and again, and again, until Zrae was driven out of the building and into the fields, Feral, pounding away at Zrae’s defenses,  striking high, low, to the left, to the right, for the chest, constantly, putting Zrae on the full defensive, relentlessly plunging for an opening, a single error, for a death strike. Dragod shook off his disorientation and sprung into action, soul-dagger in hand and ready, speedily levitating towards us, casting protective magical wards about me, spells I couldn’t even recognize, I laughed mirthfully as Zrae managed to score a death-stab only to have his blade throw wide, and Feral to plunge into his hip, searing through flesh, bone, organ, and tendon, his flesh parting to the sheer ferocity and anger emanating from my blade. A large gout of blood erupted from the wound as I savagely ripped the blade from his anguished form. Unexpectedly an enraged mental scream permeated our minds as Zrae opened a portal to the Daemonworld and slipped in quickly. 
<br />
 	“||censored||!” Dragod stated.
<br />
	“Feh, Be happy he was alone.”
<br />
 	And I left it at that, I entered the stable, grabbed our ||censored||, and left, heading East toward the Westinar Mountains.
<br />
	“Where are you going??”
<br />
	“The mountains, the cold, demons can’t stand the cold”
<br />
	“ You know how ||censored|| cold those mountains are??”
<br />
	“That’s the point mortal”
<br />
	
<br />
	Dragod left it at that, and used his magicks to teleport to a spot known to him, 50  or so leages to the east, draining him thoroughly.
<br />

<br />

<br />
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />

<br />
                The Dark elf was fast, to fast, the minor Daemon couldn't keep up with his speed, or his bladesmanship. Two shining daggers of the deepest black, spinning out in wide arcs, making short thrusts every second or two, this was the unique fighting style of one man, Ezeikel. The daemon made one error, he thought this dark elf normal. The Daemon's two headed bladed staff and wickedly spiked tail both went left, intending to pound thru the drow's defenses. Ezeikel went right, farther right, much farther, two flicks of his wrists, and all the daemon saw before his life forced faded completely, was the flash of the two Izralim flying deep into his eyesockets, and burying to the hilt. The drow stopped, eased his bloodlust, and walked off, summoning his daggers to his hands, bereft of the heatblood previously soaking said blades.
<br />

<br />
              Ezeikel was no normal assassin, granted him a daemon's life span, he has fast surpassed all other assassins in the craft, knowledge, and even entered the studies of magic. Fast with a blade, even faster with a spell to gain a subtle advantage.
<br />

<br />
            Zrae's minions had been following him ever since the meeting in Arathym, in that tavern where he met the forger of his blades, the Daemon King, Deliric. He reached up, to feel the locket around his neck, the silent warmth emanating from it, feeling comforted knowing his friend was safe. Suddenling, white fire erupted forth from the locket, forming a command on the ground in the daemon text, " Izral, gof urata violr minproe Xiraza". It read, simply saying, Life force in Danger, daemons here.  Chanting a few words, to open a portal, he summoned a nightmare steed, and rode off into the night, to the eastern mountains of Westinar.
<br />

<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br />

<br />
	The cold of night, swept about them, biting them, teasing them, the cabin on the hill ahead seemed to keep gaining distance from them, the fire in the window, swaying, torturing their frozen bodies, until they collapsed.
<br />

<br />
  A woman gasped, looking out of her window, two dark forms collapsing into the snow. "HONEY! Two men just collapsed into the snow! Go and help them!"
<br />

<br />
   "It's probably bandits honey, leave them"
<br />

<br />
 The woman slapped him and pointed to the snowclothes.
<br />

<br />
" Fine fine fine!, but im going armed damnit"
<br />

<br />
 	The man took a minute or two to strap on furred clothing and set out blankets, and set his wife to making warm tea. He went to the door, took a deep breath, and fast as he could, opened the door, jumped out and closed it, as to not let the warm air out. Trudging through the snow, holding his hood tight about his face, as to keep out the cold, he approached he bodies, both hooded, he dragged them by their packs to the cabin, tried to brush off as much of the snow as he could, as to keep the inside warm and dry, he once again as fast as he could, opened the door, pushed the two forms into the room, and followed right after closing the door, he leaned back against the door, and took a deep breath, and tried to absorbed some of the head from the fire, all the warmth gone from his body, in just 30 seconds outside the cabin, how these two ever made it this far, he'd love to know.
<br />
	
<br />
	The man was hard at work, stripping the two of their traveling clothes and packs, the smaller form first, as it had less, both of the two were warming at the fire, the wood beneath them slowly getting wet from the melting snow about the two. The smaller man, seemingly old, with silver hair, but the body of a youth, about the age of 25, with blade scars all over his body, wrapped in a blanket cocoon and warming at the fire.
<br />
When the man started to remove the bigger man's clothes, he noticed something about the face, he couldn't see it outside, but he turned the head sideways a bit, and pulled back the cowl, and gasped. " By the gods! a Demon!" he screamed, Deliric's innate alertness awoke him instantly, hopping to his feet and shedding all his traveling gear with a phase-shrug, and pulling his blade while backing up into a wall, looking around, trying to discern his location, " Where am I?!"
<br />
	The couple cowering in a corner, had no response, only fear, for so wicked a being, in their very home.  Deliric calmed, and said very slowly, "Where am I good sir?
<br />

<br />
 " M-m-my c-ca-ca-cabin sir."
<br />
 " Insensitive ||censored|| prick, change forms and quit scaring the ||censored|| out of these peasants"
<br />
 	Well, apparently Dragod was awake. I looked at myself, and indead, i was in daemon form,  humanoid, large fangs, raging muscles bulging on the slight frame of an agile fighter, short flaming horns, pointing forward, marking me a Delirick, THE Deliric. I Began to shift form, fangs disapearing, muscles softening, losing size to the fragilities of human form, once again i felt human, weak, unsafe, but i dealt with the mental loss, of the sheer power of my demon form.
<br />
 
<br />
   " Well good sir," I said speaking directly to the man, as i walked toward him, ' It seems we have impeeded in on your fine night, and your hospitality, I bid you accept my apology." The man had relaxed visibly, with the loss of my daemon qualities, but he was still edgy, and afraid, what normal person wouldn't?
<br />

<br />
 By the time, Dragod and Deliric had got the man speaking normally, the warmth had fully suffused them, and revitalized Deliric. The man was an animal herder for a farm about a mile down the pass, the only open land in the mountains, and used well, his wife stayed at home for the last 7 months, she was with child. The cabin itself, was rather large, with a cellar well stocked with food, wine, and firewood, to last out the winter, almost two. According to the Daern, for that was the man's name, the winter storms would break for a week, and me and Dra could make it out of the other side of the pass, and into more hospitable weather. He offered mounts, and i snickered, at him. He gazed toward me inquiringly, and i merely asked him if he happend to have a forge anywhere nearby. He directed me to the warmth room cellar, off and to the side from under the cabin, well stocked with coal, and ores for the smith. I requested a small amount of mithril or adamantite, to which he said he had about 50lbs worth of both but he needed them for trading between the dwarves of Blunthead and the forest people of Greenhaven, the elves, who needed said ore for fighting the endless onslaught of orcs, goblins, and giants entering their borders every day. It took me a minute to search through my pack to find the casing, but when i found it, i tossed it to Daern, and received only a quizzical look, " For the mithril and adamantite" I said, he looked skeptical, 50lbs of mithril AND adamantite was a LOT. All doubts towards the worth of the gemstone took flight when he opened the coffer, and viewed the biggest soul gem, he'd ever seen, small by Deliric's measure, for he forged with them daily as an apprentice, they were practice peices, expendable if you will, But here on the mortal realm, such soul gems, of even a small size, could buy towns.
<br />

<br />
	The next day came slow, night was long here, in the high peaks of Westinar, but it wasn't cold, never near the forges, the flames searing any who entered the room, other than Deliric, used to the flames, for he was borne to them, and Dragod, wearing an anti-heat enchantment. Deliric looked solemn, as he banged away on the adamantite, muscles, rippling, light red flesh, flushing with blood, a severe look of concentration on. Always with the lower armor on, in the two short weeks that Dragod had known him, Deliric had never shifted, moved, or taken off his lower armor, it was like the bottom didn't come off. Dark red and black, combination plate and chainmail armor, adorned him when he so chose, never a helmet, he may have been big, but he was agile as a hellcat, and stronger than any 100ox, but gentle as a kitten if he so chose. So angry he seemed, banging away at the raw ore, making it seem larger, more than it was. One of Deliric's soul gems, was working hard at it, dangling from a chain wrapped about his hand as he flexed his arms in, out, in, out. Eventually he got it to the shape he wanted, a long thin, twisting strip, as if to entangle a wrist or shin. I slowly began to realize what he was doing when he pulled the block of Mithril onto the forge and began to work the metal like he had the adamantite. He was forging me boots of speed, the soulgem could be enchanted to increase stamine, and leg strength, and agility, he was forging me anklets of fortitude. His intuitive creation of the anklets with soulgem, adamantite, and mithril, was quite unique, as while the adamantite would preserve the enchantment and keep it together for all of time, the mithril it self would be enchanted with a magic dweomer that would boulster the effect of the enchantment itself, making it double more powerful.
<br />

<br />
	 The days and weeks flew by, Dragod pacing endlessly, waiting for the winter storms to wane. Deliric meditating slowly, regaining his strength, forseeing great hardship close ahead.
<br />

<br />
	The winter finally broke, and Dragod burst outdoors, breathing deeply, relishing the open air, preceeding Deliric's calm walk, he'd spent a millenia trapped in the abysmal pits of hell, he could stand a month in a warm house with plenty of provisions. Dragod slowly walked about the area, watching the snow melt, the sun warm, beating in the sky, enjoying the cool breeze whisking by his robes, when suddenly he was struck from behind, a cold missile perfectly aimed, exploding against his head.
<br />

<br />
	Deliric balled another snowball and let fly, Dragod rolling to the ground, rolling his own and throwing it mid roll to hit Deliric in the chest, laughing all the way. Deliric, feigning all seriousness, launched himself mid-air wings, sprouting from his back with a gout of blood, and already working furiously to keep him aloft, he dived toward Dragod and feigned left, and beamed the snowball at Dragod, nearly hitting him in the leg, only to explode on a magical fire ward. Dragod had upped the notch, using such a dangerous ward for a mere snowball fight. Deliric laughed to himself, Dragod understood, Deliric wanted to spar, but still have fun at the same time, and they both gauged each others abilities correctly, able to dispell wards or pull throws if the other stumbles. Deliric grabbed a massive tuft of snow in his great arms, and use his magicks to ball it together tightly, where it would explode on impact, but would hold its form for his throw. Dragod's eyes widened at the sight of Mighty Deliric, holding aloft a gigantic snowball and slowly levitating toward him, great purple and black wings, slowly pulsating in and out, a meager effort considering Deliric's weight. Deliric advanced quickly now, Dragod mind racing, he pulled out a slender black wand, and pointed it directly at the center of the snowball. Deliric heaved his great arms launching the snow boulder, right as Dragod let fly a bold of lightning, instantly melting the snow boulder, and inadvertantly soaking Dragod as the maelstrom of water thudded in to him, soaking his robes. The sad look on Dragod face brought a small snicker to Deliric, he'd one the day, but Dragod would have to spend time inside the cabin drying out his robes, as they were the only one he had. For Dragod, the moments fun was over, and Deliric shared in the sour frown, wishing they could continue, a bit of fun was good for the soul.<br />_________________<br />Feralblade says, "Punt more Gnomes!"
