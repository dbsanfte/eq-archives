<strong>RANGER EPIC 1.5 WALKTHROUGH</strong><br>
<li> Thank you JonnyRC for your work on this<br>
<br>
<li> Completed with the cooperation and help of hundreds of Rangers serverwide, and the assistance of EQRangers.COM and <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/">The Ranger's Glade</a><br>
<br>
<li> The First Ranger comfirmed to have completed Epic 1.5 is "Darkfirez" from the solusek ro server<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 1</strong><br>
<br>
Althele says 'Hello, friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally, but lately? I sense that something is [out of balance].'<br>
<br>
Althele says 'I don't know for certain what is wrong. It feels like the start of a cold, a sort of tickling at the back of Norrath's throat, if I may make such a poor metaphor. In much the same way that I can sense that you have wielded the power of nature, probably in the form of the weapons known as Swiftwind and Earthcaller, I can sense a power of illness creeping upon the land. Please, if you come across anything suspicious bring it to me. I am worried, this does not feel like a natural sickness to me. Go with the blessing of the Mother and the speed of the Storm, my child.'<br>
<br>
Forage in Rathe Mountains for Sickly Maiden's Hair (rare forage, lore, nodrop) and return it to Althele.<br>
<br>
Althele says 'This plant has an illness that I have never sensed before.' Althele pauses in thought for a moment. 'You are a hunter, so I shall put your skills to work. First, take this to Corun in Surefall. He is an expert on animal illnesses. Then put your hunting skills to work and see if you can capture any animals that may have eaten this plant. Corun will want to see them to help him discover what the sickness is.'<br>
<br>
You receive Tuft of Sickly Maiden's Hair<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 2</strong><br>
<br>
Turn in to Corun Finisc in Surefall. Ensure you have a free main inventory slot for a container!<br>
<br>
Corun Finisc says 'Well, this is certainly an unpleasant sight. If Althele sent you to me it must be because I've had a lot of experience with sick animals. If you can find me some animals that have become ill by eating this plant perhaps I can discover something about this disease. You must not kill these animals. It is never good to harm an animal if you do not need to. It is also important that the animal be alive when you take samples of their blood. If any animals have eaten this plant and become ill, you need to find a way to capture them and use your fletching kit and these vials to gather blood samples. Althele is rarely wrong about what she senses from Antonica. Be carefull with that medicine bag, I borrowed it from a friend in Halas a while back. I'll need you to use it to store some samples as you capture the animals. Don't lose it, you don't want Lars angry with you!'<br>
<br>
You receive a Borrowed Medicine Bag (6 slot container with combine button) and 6 Magical Sample Vials. Now we need to capture the animals. The clue is in Corun's fletching kit reference.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 3</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Construct Traps.. see recipies to the left</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Step 4</strong><br>
<br>
You use these weapons to capture the animals by attacking them with it. In the case of the lasso, equip a shield, fire beetle eye, fletching trophy or something else that won't attack in offhand. The mob should despawn at 25% and give you a Captured animal on your cursor which you combine with the vial in your fletching kit. It appears that you are free to use damage shields, magic and procs, but the first damage done to the animal by anyone MUST be with the capture weapon, or it tends to bug the mob and make it uncapturable until killed and respawned. There is also apparently a 20% random chance that the capture will fail even if you did everything right. All these mobs are trackable, do not have PHs, and respawn between 1 and 2 hours. They hit for about 100.<br>
<br>
Siren's Grotto - A Twitching Swordfish (butterfly net) - Loc??<br>
##Zone in from CS, and invis up. Invis is not going to help you for long, but mine as well get as few adds as possible. Go to the water and dive in. Go to the left and swim into the tunnle. Now swim straight up through the "pipe" and over the waterfall. Go over the fall, and swim out of the water to the left. Re-invis to prevent new aggro (mobs out of water don't see invis) and follow wall to the left. Run through the tunnle, keeping on left wall till you zone into WW.<br>
<br>
Zone back into sirens, and run back through the tunnle to the waters edge on your right. Look down and this is where the swordfish spawns...he should be the only mob in that pool.<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule - A Sickly Mosquito (butterfly net) - Loc p990, n55,<br>
##This is the hardest. I recommend bringing a channter for crowd control, and definatly a healer.<br>
<br>
Zone in, and run through the double doors. Run straight forward and up the ladder. Go up and to your right should be a pool, dive in and swim to the bottom. Once in, go forward, and pop up to waters surface. you'll see 2 ladders. Climb either. At the top, go through a door and down the ramp into the first circular room. Go straight ahead. From here on out, at least 1 mob per room sees invis, with a huge aggro range. Pull the room, clear it and go right. Repeat this for every room, going right. In the last room, it's only possible to go left. Going through you'll go into another small room with no mobs. On your right is the pool room that leads to the temple. There's 4 mosquitos, of which one is the sickly.<br>
<br>
Don't even think about soloing this unless you know sewers well and have very good equipment.<br>
<br>
Temple of Droga - A Bloated Drogan Spider (eight loop lasso) - Loc p450, p410,<br>
##Zone in, (invis of course) and veer to the right. You're going to fall through a fake floor. You can keep invis, down a tunnle. Eventually you'll run smack into the room with the spider. It's in the first room. You can pull all the goblins before it solo, then just run up with the lasso and capture it. This is by far the easiest to get to.<br>
<br>
Chardok B - A Leprous Chokidai (eight loop lasso) - Loc p165, p40,<br>
##Bring a gate potion, exit is very hard to get to. Also have levitate on<br>
<br>
Zone into chardok A and start running down the path. Eventually on your right is a castle, go into it, through the double door and over the bridge. keep following the path till you eventually come to a second bridge. Dive off to the left, sink to the bottom, and go through the waterfall. On your immediate left is a nich with a lever in it. If you see any doors you have gone too far. Click the lever to zone into chardok B.<br>
<br>
Once inside, you may be able to invis right to the Chokidai, but it may be that you have to do some clearing (it's random)<br>
<br>
Anyhow, veer off to the right, and you're shortly going to see a fence. Hop over and boom, you're gonna be at the mob. Track makes this mob easy once you're in chardok b.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 5 SKIP THIS STEP!!</strong><br>
Combine the 4 animal samples and hand the Closed Medicine Bag back to Corun(You can skip this part and just combine all 6 to get a full Medicine Bag).<br>
<br>
Corun Finisc looks over the contents of the medicine bag with a thoughtful expression. 'I wonder if this illness can affect so-called sentient beings. Take this back for now. Go and seek intelligent creatures that may have been affected by this illness. I don't care if you have to kill them, that's fine. Such beings are not of my concern. A couple of samples of their blood should be enough for me to discover something about this disease. I have been hearing from others that the course of this disease is not natural. As your own work corroborates, this illness has spread across species and locations that indicate an unnatural force. Please hurry, even I am beginning to believe that the term plague is appropriate in this situation. I shudder to think how this might affect this sacred glade.<br>
<br>
You get the bag and previous blood samples back. Now you must collect two more blood samples - as the text suggests these can be fought and killed normally. The samples do NOT have to be combined with the remaining 2 vials.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 6</strong><br>
<br>
Western Waste - A Neuralgic Huntress - Loc Roams,<br>
Spawns in Western Wastes and roams the area between the two canyons. CoV mobs will assist her. Triples for 600 and summons, but slowable. Duoable with a healer in EP+ gear.<br>
<br>
Veksar - An Asteatotic Highborn - Loc??,<br>
##Ok, I'd bring a pally for this, or a necro, and whatever classes you want for comfort. Zone in, and clear the little blue goblins. They're like, maybe level 40 if that.<br>
<br>
Go left and up the ramp into the "temple" like area. Invs vs. Undead up, you can pretty much run to the camp with IVU.<br>
<br>
take the passage to your left, then follow untill the next hallway. In the second opening to your left, make a left. In the next room, go right and down the stairs. U-turn around in this small room to the left and keep following the path. In the next room, head up and to the right, following the path. Follow the path to the very end, then turn into the last alcove and dive into the water. Follow the water straight and pop up out into another room, with an exit to the right.<br>
<br>
In the next room, hang a left, and hug the left wall up some stairs. go down and hug the right wall. you may have to kill a few golems, jsut follow wall right. Up ahead should be a ramp. Don't go up it, it takes you back to zonein. Go left a bit into the first building. Follow that building up the stairs to the very end and then jump off the ledge down into the highborn courtyard. the first citidel on your right has your mob. Go up the stairs, pull the mobs, and he should be in the back right corner.<br>
<br>
This is just to make it easier for people who may be trying to solo and don't have time to experiment with track and an in game map. This should clear up any problems getting to these 6 mobs so far!<br>
<br>
<br>
Combine the 2 new samples with the previous 4 in in your bag to get a Full Medicine Bag. Turn this in to Corun, and you receive Corun's Notes. ** At this time Corun will eat the closed medicine bag at specific game times without returning anything if you do not have Earthcaller. but you can still do it without Earthcaller you just have to turn in a full Medicine Bag and it should not be eatten.<br>
<br>
Corun Finisc says 'This is frightening. A disease that can affect mosquito and wyvern must be a truly horrible thing. I will examine these samplese carefully and pass knowledge to others who are working to repair this. From what you've shown me I can tell that the disease affects both the mind and the skin. Others seek information about illnesses of the skin. I need you to uncover information about diseases of the mind. I know not where to find such information, but you are a seeker and a worthy ranger. Find someone, somewhere, that knows enough about disease that affects 'more advanced' creatures such as men. Learn about the diseases of the mind. I will seek among the folk of the glad adn pine for assistance with a cure for the Maiden's Hair. Please do not give up the search, no matter how difficult. This is a terrible illness and we must stop it from spreading. Take a copy of my notes with you, they may be of use to someone with the right knowledge.'<br>
<br>
Text of the notes: 'This is a lengthy list of details about the effects of Maiden's Hair disease. It describes similarites between the way it addects animals and the way that other diseases manifes. From what you see, there are twi facets to the disease. It causes a painfully dry skin condition that often leads to excessive bleeding. The more deadly symptom affects the brain, causing incredible pain in the spine and head. This, Corun speculates, can lead to a shut down of the mind or a form of pain-driven insanity. '<br>
<br>
Copyed From Arksien's post at Ranger's Glade<br>
This means was done by Arksien = ##<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 7</strong><br>
<br>
Talk to Shana Liskia, Enchanter Guildmaster in the Academy of Arcane Sciences in West Freeport.<br>
<br>
You say, "What diseases of the mind?"<br>
<br>
Shana Liskia says, 'I study the mind. My most recent research deals with, well, I'd rather not discuss that. Unless you need something specific, I dont really have time for long random conversations right now.'<br>
<br>
Hand Shana Corun's Notes. You receive back Corun's Notes - annotated. This turn in works at Apprehensive faction.<br>
<br>
Shana Liskia says 'Well, this certainly is an interesting puzzle. I see here that these creatures were infected in their spinal columns. I'll tell you that a part of my research involves the use of the fluids of the brain and spine. I suspect that further details might be unpleasant. I might be able to help you, but I'll need materials to work with. Gather fluids from the brain of the creature with the greatest mental power that you can find. I'll test it and see if its strong enough and has the right properties. If I can duplicate what you saw in these infected creatures, perhaps I can help. Aslo, bring back those notes that Corun made, I'll need them as well.' Shana makes a few hasty scribbles in the margins of Corun's Notes and hands them back to you.<br>
<br>
Additional note text: In the margin of Corun's notes, Shana has jotted incantations and odd words such as Gloombelly Vine that imply unusual mystical ingredients.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 8</strong><br>
<br>
Go to the Deep. An ancient thought horror spawns from a trap near -750 +400. Difficulty about the same as the wyvern or highborn. Kill it and loot Thick Spinal Fluid. Return this and the annotated notes to Shana.<br>
<br>
Shana Liskia says 'Perfect! Yes, this will work nicely.' Shana looks through Corun's notes while gathering items from her stores. 'This should work. What I'm going to do is grow a crystal around this fluid and some of the key ingredients of the disease. The crystal will focus the power of the fluid and the elements of the disease will guide it. If this goes well, I should be able to create a crystal that will guide you to the disease.' Shana places the gathered items into a violet-tinted container and casts a spell over them. A moment later she retrieves a crystal from the container. The crystal is clear except for a dark, murky coloration at the center. 'Take that crystal and see if you can locate any creatures with the disease. If you have any success, please return and let me know.'<br>
<br>
You receive a Mind Crystal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 9</strong><br>
<br>
Head back to East Karana. The crystal glows warm in the presence of Althele and Tholris.<br>
<br>
You say, 'You are diseased'<br>
<br>
Tholris looks at you indignantly.<br>
<br>
You say, 'You are diseased'<br>
<br>
Tholris kicks dirt at your feet.<br>
<br>
You say, 'You are diseased'<br>
<br>
Tholris shakes his head. Then he catches a glimpse of the Mind Crystal and looks thoughtful for a moment. Then he reaches into his pocket and produces two unusual crystals and hands them to you. Althele says, 'Tholris found these on the shore a little while ago. I don't see how they could be related to your search, but take them if you need them'.<br>
<br>
You receive a Red Crystal and a Violet Crystal. Take them back to Shana in Freeport.<br>
<br>
Shana Liskia says 'Ah, well, it seems as though the crystal was attuned to these other crystals. They must have come in contact with a rather large element of the disease, otherwise I just can't see how the Mind Crystal would have noticed them. These crystals were created by someone with more experience than I have in this area. I will examine them further and attempt to learn something from them. I can tell now, though, that they were probably created in a fashion similar to the one I used to create the Mind Crystal.' Shana pulls out a piece of parchment and writes a note. She gives you the note and says, 'Take this note to Corun along with the Mind Crystal. He can use the crystal and my notes to seek out the plague in whatever fashion he thinks is best. I need to get to work investigating these new crystals.'<br>
<br>
You receive a Letter to Corun.<br>
<br>
Text of the letter: 'You do not know me, Corun of the Glade. Our paths will never meet, I suspect. So you must trust my word and that of your ranger'. The crystal that we have created for you will be able to locate traces of the Maiden's Hair disease under the proper circumstances. I hope that it aids you in your efforts to protect us from this illness. Your notes have put a bit of a fright into me and I have no desire to suffer from the illness you describe. I wish you luck and send you my appreciation of the talent of the one you sent to seek a cure. I trust that you will be able to solve this mystery and find a cure.'<br>
<br>
Take the letter and Mind Crystal back to Corun in Surefall.<br>
<br>
Corun Finisc looks at the crystal for a moment; confusion, disgust and curiosity chasing each other across his tired face. After reading the letter, he looks up at you. 'This crystal seems strange, but if you and this Shana believe that it will help, then I know just the person to put it to work.' Corun puts the note and the crystal into a pouch. He reaches into another pouch to retrieve something small and hands it to you. 'This seed was brought to us by a druid of great skill. It should provide the cure we seek, but we do not know the place or circumstances under which to plant it. We have agreed to leave it to you to find that place and that time. I urge you to hasten, we do not know how long it will be until the plague is released upon us in earnest. The only thing that I know is that there may be a link between those that created the disease and the Plane of Discord. A very tenuous link, but keep the seed with you at all times, you never know when you will need it. May the Mother smile on your effort.'<br>
<br>
You receive a Red Dogwood Seed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 10</strong><br>
<br>
Gather a small raid force - so far this event has been done by 3 groups of time equipped players - and form up in Bloodfields at a safe distance from the three buildings in the Northwest before the Ruined City zone. Have someone else pull and clear the buildings and roamers in the area, as they will assist. When ready, go near the buildings (Around p300 p750) with the seed. Several mobs will spawn.<br>
<br>
Marshal Histent - Level 70 - Roughly 500k hp, hits in the 1600s, rampages, has an AE cold 1500 DD/stun on a (-300 CR) check.<br>
<br>
Grinbik the Fertile - Level 70<br>
Golem which hits for about 1100 and is snarable and mezzable. He moves slowly and is easy to kite. He is controlled by the Marshal, and needs to have some sense beaten into him. Leaving him until the others are dead, and slowly applying DPS, he will eventually respawn non-aggro.<br>
<br>
An eager student - Level 68 - Two of these spawn.<br>
<br>
An enslaved earthmover - 68 - Mezzable.<br>
<br>
A noc darklurch - Three of these are already in buiding before spawns.<br>
<br>
Screen Shot from MathawasAB's post at Ranger's Glade.<br>
<br>
Several more mezzable (and charmable) adds will spawn throughout the fight.<br>
<br>
The encounter stays up for 40 minutes if not engaged, and has a 2 hour respawn.<br>
<br>
Grinbik the Fertile respawns non-aggro upon winning the encounter. Hail him and you receive Grinbik's Blessing (which looks like a pile of black sand.) He will then despawn, and a loot chest has a chance of appearring. Only one ranger can get this piece per kill. You wil also get this text.<br>
<br>
Grinbik the Fertile says, I wish to speak with the one that freed me.<br>
<br>
Grinbik the Fertile shouts, Aaaah! A deep rumbling boice flows along the ground. I thank you callius. You have freed me from such torture! Imagine me grinbik the fertile forced to kill & destroy! I was created to nurture and protect! I must go back to my own home and begin again to be what I was ment to be. I am honored and grateful to you for saving me. I see that you carry a powerful seed, nearly a seedling with its desire to grow! As my first act upon regaining myself I must aid you. If you wish that seed to flourish, you must find the land here that remains fertile. It is a rare thing but i have seen it. Take with you my blessing. This is a portion of my own power and it will aide you and that seed. I also know that my cousin Senvial is a slave here somewhere. You will need his aide as well to acheive your goal. Deliver that seedling and our blessing into the fertile ground and it will grow very quickly indeed. Thank you again Callius! all present should praise you for your kind heart and warrior spirit.'<br>
<br>
You receive Grinbik's Blessing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 11</strong><br>
<br>
In Natimbi - Head straight west from magus zone in and you should be close when you hit the west wall. When you get close just like the Marshal encounter the Spiritbinder Trenzar and two spirit's will spawn, You will want to pull and kill the Spirit's first then engage Spiritbinder Trenzar. During the fight Senival of the mist and some adds will spawn.<br>
<br>
Senival of the mist - Level ? (loc n550, p1600) - He will spawn some time during the fight with Spiritbinder Trenzar and aggro also.<br>
<br>
Spiritbinder Trenzar - Level 70 - ? hp, hits in the 2000's, unslowable, has an AE cold 1500 DD (-300 FR) check.<br>
<br>
A bound earth spirit - Level ?<br>
<br>
A bound fire spirit - Level ?<br>
<br>
Now you have to get Senival to around 10% health then he should stop attacking and be hailable. you don't have to kill Spiritbinder Trenzar just get Senival to spawn and lose arrgo, lets say a wipe. Then this text and item.<br>
<br>
Senvial of the Mist stops moving and, with obvious effort, becomes more like mist than water. The elemental spirit remains in this position as it struggles to maintain control of its own will.<br>
<br>
You say, Hail, Senvial of the Mist<br>
<br>
Senvial of the Mist says 'Thank you for freeing me, (Char_Name). I am not sure how it is that you broke the power that commanded me, but for that I am very grateful.' The water spirit looks at you carefully before speaking again. 'I sense that you will need my aid in the future. To repay my debt to you I give you my blessing. This is no mean thing, it carries with it a portion of my own power. Mine is hte cool rain and soft mist. I am the essence of morning dew and the lazy fog. I have no doubt that you will use it wisely. There are more of my kin enslaved by these beasts and others liek them. You appear to have the pwoer to rescue them as you have me. I am not a being of foresight or far-seeing, mine is the realm of small, gentle things, but even I can see that you are a being of portent. I am honored to have met you. I must return to my realm. I shall never forget this place and what it has mad eme do, nor shall I forget the one thing that freed me.'<br>
<br>
You receive, Senival's Blessing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Step 12</strong><br>
<br>
Now off to Jaggedpine Forest, at (loc p1380 n960,) you will find a ground spawn Fertile Earth place the - A Red Dogwood Seed, Grinbik's Blessing and Senival's Blessing in the Fertile Earth and combine it at the same place you find the Fertile Earth any were else dose not work, A tree will start to grow and you will get this text and two items.<br>
<br>
The seed grows rapidly the moment you push it beneath the soil. It appears at first as a mere shoot, but within moments grows into a stout sapling and then into a gigantic tree. The tree is one you've never seen before. It is the coloration and thick bark of a redwood with the thick bole indicative of the species. The tree is, however, far too short and has spindly branches sprouting from it with beautiful flowers that you would expect on a dogwood. You take all of this in at a glance. It takes you a moment longer to realize that the tree is moving.<br>
<br>
Red Dogwood Treant looks about for a moment. It peers at the sky and the earth for a while. It then looks down and says, 'We finally meet. thank you for helping me to grow. I understand that I have been blessed by spirits of rain and earth and that is why I can speak to you and move. You have given me much, my friend. Now I would give something to you.' The great treantgently pulls a small piece of wood from its bole. The wood is hard and dark. It then reaches down with one of its high branches and plucks a singular flower, smaller and of blue color that differs from the white of the others. The petals fall from the flower as he reaches out and hands you these two items. 'I have been with you and your people for a while. I know what you seek. That seed will grow the plant you need. The heartwood is for you. May it serve you well.'<br>
<br>
In yellow text he speaks to you.<br>
The Red Dogwood Treant speaks directly into your mind. 'My day of growth is a glorious one, but now that I can sense the world directly I feel a dangerous presence invading it. There is a force of chaos here, I can feel it in my limbs. I am not the only one that feels this, for I hear others thinking about it. Many of them do not know what it is, they can not understand its force, but they are reacting to it. I sense that our world is becoming more dangerous, that there is a change coming. I also feel something closer, something coming. Something knows I have become aware. It is a servant of the chaos. It... it reaches for me!'<br>
<br>
The Red Dogwood Treant screams in pain. 'Something has grasped my very soul! It seeks to consume me!' The treant begins to wither.<br>
<br>
In your mind you feel the treant suffering and asks your permission to serve you rather than suffer consumption. Of course you agree, and you feel the treant's relief. You sense the spirit of the amazingcreature leave its own body and enter the heartwood that it so recently gave to you. It speaks to you once more before completely merging with the wood. 'I sensed another there, a great nature spirit enslaved. It was this spirit that was forced to find me and be a conduit for my destruction. You must find and free him! He suffers so! I can aid you as i did before with Senvial and Grinbik, though it may be difficult for me to speak to you again. Thank you for everything, friend.'<br>
<br>
You recive, Red Dogwood Heartwood, Spring Dogwood Seed.<br>
<br>
Now off to Surefall Glade's, find Corun and give him the Spring Dogwood Seed and you will get this text and an item.<br>
<br>
Corun Finisc look at the seed, perplexed for a moment. Then he suddenly goes into motion. He pulls a sheaf of papers from a backpack and riffles through them. He mutters to himself as he compares the seed to sketches in the notes. 'This is it! If we plant this seed and its seeds widely enough, it should protect and even cure the Maiden's Hair with its pollen! You've done it! Thank you! The Glade thanks you. You've saved many good and fair things from death.' Corun looks crestfallen for a moment. 'I only wish I had something to give you to express our appreciation. From what you have told me I think this may help you. It is a rare metal, I hope you can find a worthy use for it.<br>

<strong>Step 13</strong><br>
<br>
Go to the Ruined City of Dranik. Head north from zonein and turn right when you reach the east-west valley. Up the slope is an entrance to a courtyard with many snakes and a red con ogre Krekk Brimblade (a warrior epic mob.) North of the courtyard is the entrance to a fort. Have your raid clear the west wing of the fort then back out to the entrance. When ready head in and Svenril Fireskin and Uisima, Lord of the Depths will spawn. Apparently has a 1500 AE and mezzable adds. Take 3-4 groups.<br>
<br>
Similar to the two previous fights keep Uisima, Lord of the Depths busy via offtanking or kiting and kill Svenril Fireskin, who has a 1500 AE and spawns mezzable/snarable/slowable adds (sound familiar?) Once Svenril is dead, slowly take Uisima down to low health until he respawns non-aggro and hail him.<br>
<br>
Uisima Lord of the Depth says " It is good to be free again. Thank you for your help. Now, let us forget the past, for that is the only way that i shall be able to regain my life. Let us look into your future and the future of your friend the treant. I must somehow make amends for the pain that i have caused him. Please let me see the heartwood in which he now resides.<br>
<br>
Turn the Red Dogwood Heartwood in, and he will return you Wind-Blessed Heartwood.<br>
<br>
Uisima Lord of the Depths holds the wood for a while, peering into the smooth grains it. After a few moments he speaks " We are in agreement, the treant and I. You have been my saviour and his creator. There seems only one way to repay your efforts on our behalf. ' Uisima holds the heartwood at armslength and breathes lightly to it. You feel as much as hear the treant sigh with pleasure at the feel of the breath. You too feel the breeze brush our face and in it you understand what is happening. Uisima is freeing the wood and the treant inside to take a shape of its choosing. The wood grows, changing shape to become something more than it was, Uisima hands the wood back to you. The Red Dogwood treant is a rare creature, gentle in spirit but strong in conviction. He says that he is honored to serve you in this fashion. Take this wood and form around it a blade made of the finest silver. We both thank you but I must go now or I might be captured once again.<br>
