Here we will look at the aspects of Fletching and Bowsmithing.. including prices, components and combinations..  We'll tell you where to go, what to do and how to do it.
<br>
<br>
<font size="2" color="#00FF00">WHERE TO BUY YOUR SUPPLIES</font> ::<br>
<br>
Fletching Merchants can be found in, <a href="where.htm">almost, every zone and city</a> in Norrath.. but, the question is.. do you really want to pay those prices?.  We at EQRangers recommend three primary stops for your fletching needs:  <br>
<li><a href="maps.htm#firiona">Firiona Vie Docks</a> (Kunark) - <i>Best Prices !!</i>
<li><a href="maps.htm#kelethin">Kelethin</a> (Greater Faydark), 
<li><a href="maps.htm#surefall">Surefall Glade</a> (near Qeynos)<br><br>
Of course, we know that sometimes it's just not convenient to travel great distances to buy your supplies.. <a href="where.htm">Click Here</a> for a complete list of Fletching Arrow and Bow Merchants.

Now that you know where to go.. here's what to do..<br>
<br>
<font size="2" color="#00FF00">YOUR FLETCHING KIT IS YOUR FRIEND</font><br><br>
<img src="images/kit02.gif" width="100" height="290" border="0" align="right" alt="" hspace="10"><img src="images/kit01.gif" width="100" height="290" border="0" align="left" alt="" hspace="10">
Fletching Kits can be found at any Fletching Merchant.. and cost approximately 1 or 2 platinum, depending on your faction with the merchant.  This kit, when properly used, can produce Arrows and Bows.. depending on your Fletching Skill Level.  
<br><br><br>
The Kit may also act as a backpack, if your other containers are full.. just be careful of that "Combine" button, you dont want to click it when you're not fletching.. you WILL lose everything in the kit.
<br><br>
Basically, your kit looks like a 'Large Box'.. open it by "Right Clicking" the kit and place one of each component into the kit..(<font color="#00FF00">to the left</font>) and click "Combine".. ( see our <a href="fletchguide.htm">Fletching Charts</a> for these component combinations).. If combined Successfuly, you will have a new bundle of arrows (or a bow) (<font color="#00FF00">to the right</font>) ready for battle.. If your attempt Failed.. you will see "You lack the skills needed to fashion these items together".. If your skill level has surpassed your selected combination, you will see "You can no longer advance".. and it's time to move on..
