				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">I'm about at 50% success. Most of my successes have come when my group is all or mostly Guild Members. I think because we all know each others playing style and work well together. I think class is not the major issue, though you obviously wouldn't want 6 of the same class, but wether the player behind the class plays well. I know its pretty much impossible to tell how good someone is if you've never grouped with them before but if you have a choice I would suggest grouping with people you know and trust. A mezzer and/or slower is not necessary at all. I have won without either. I think they probably make it worse because people rely on them too much. 
<br />

<br />
I think Pallies are probably the best pullers Not because they Pac pull but because they have that option. A Pally that pac's every mob isn't doing you any favors but when they know when to pac to prevent too many adds I think they are the best pullers in LDoN. I have heard Bard's are good pullers but haven't grouped with one in LDoN yet.
<br />

<br />
My biggest complaint about the new spells is Spirit of the Shrew. I don't think anyone needs to run fast in LDoN zones. If you are running you are losing IMHO. I think an indoor Harmony(i.e. Pacify) would have been way more useful. I use Harmony of nature when pulling outdoors alot and I love it. 
<br />

<br />
When I pull in LDoN I almost always die but I almost always win the adventure at the same time. Usually if I pull too many to handle I do as much damage as I can before I die(I think an AE Jolt would be nice, hehe*see spell complaints above*) and then run back while my group finishes the job. I'm not saying this is a preferred strategy and is by no means intentional but it has worked for me, LOL.
<br />

<br />
and like was said earlier FOCUS on what you need to do. Don't whine or worry about what happened just keep moving. I have been in adventures that have started off very badly, i.e. premature zoning without buffing and/or wipes and still succeed. 90 minutes is plenty of time if things are done right. 
<br />

<br />
and finally remember complacency kills. When you start getting lazy towards the end of the adventure (i.e. sloppy pulling or not refreshing key buffs that have faded) that can be detrimental.<br />_________________<br />Tohvaks Silverglade

I had to have my mage tell the chanter to take a chill pill and relax on 2 mob pulls. My earthie was more than capable of handling one critter while other was getting pummelled by main group.  When group was ready, they finished off what was left.  Chanter got no aggro and we could double pull.  LDoN seems to be designed for each class to shine especially bright in their special talent catagory. My ranger is a damage dealing seeker who can tell you if a boss is up or not.  Best advice is think of what each class is best at and how that fits into a stradegy for the whole group. Think you'll find there are all kinds of fun combinations to be tried.</span><span class="gentblsmall"></span></td>

The losses came when our cleric decided to leave in mid fight due to RL issues.... left us in  a bad situation the group was( 42 ranger, 45 druid, 47 warrior, 43 monk 47 cleric and a 40 shaman). I was the main puller with the warrior being the MT. The second loss came when  we were not getting good drops (it was a collection advent) . We klled 20 mobs( i counted) before we got our first drop. WE were getting a drop 1/8 kills. We were 2 items short when time ran out. To top it off our ML (43 enchant) decided to claim DL and leave 10 minutes before we were done. The group waited 5 min. for him to return... never did. Ruined it for everyone. 
<br />
Other than these two examples I have had a lot of fun grouping with new players and seeing their skills at work. So if there are any of you on Fernin Ro server looking for LDON group give me  tell.<br />_________________<br />Maneril newbie ranger

For now, I have given up all hope for pickup groups.  I may have one or two people as pickups, but I've had a few bad experiences with the pickup groups.
<br />

<br />
A Shaman who wouldn't meditate, wouldn't slow, barely healed, all he wanted to do was DOT and Melee.  Several times he interrupted the puller's bow shots and pulled on his own (eventually his attitude pushed the wizard to leave, then he got dropped from the group by the leader after more trouble.  So he tried to train the group, but our chanter was on top of him, mezzing everything he could bring.)

A Druid who insisted we do obscure randoms on every no drop, basically because she presumed everyone but her was some kind of cheater that would hack their randoms to win.  This person was the designated looter, so we played along.  Then as soon as the mission was successful (assassination as I recall) there was a sudden claim that Mom was going to pull the plug.  Someone suggested at least splitting the cash.   The druid then said "Catch me next time I'm on for your split," and went Linkdead.
<br />

<br />
Additionally, I've had one other instance of the looter absconding with everything.  One of a group leader who felt that we needed to kill everything down every dead end before making our way to the rescue target (even though more than half the zone was between us and the target)  kept telling the group not to worry about adds or calming before pulls because "we have a chanter" but lays a DOT on every mob, and runs off pulling other mobs to root-park and dot while the group is dealing with the existing pull.  (at the time I was the enchanter) Eventually I stopped trying to mez anything, since everything was dot'd.  Instead I focused on hasting the melees, clarity for the healer and other caster, and lots of Berserker Strength spells for the main tank (minor rune without the gem component).
<br />

<br />
On the other hand, my experiences with guild based LDON groups have been extremely successful.  Whether 3 person or 6 person or anywhere in between.  We communicate.  We count on each other.  We know our jobs and follow through!
<br />

<br />
I've never had a looter disappear on a guild LDON.  I've never had group infighting on a guild LDON.  There are a few people outside my guild I'll gladly join forces with, but for the most part, pickup groups are out for me right now.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=852643" target="_blank" class="postlink">Dharisk</a>

But as of late I don't think I could be happier.  Groups have been doing things like saying "hey let the Ranger have the Dex aug he could best use it" and other things you expect in guild groups.  I guess because people are at a higher level and are set for gear, and coin you don't run into much green problems.  And as far as knowing their classes I haven't had any problems in a while &lt;knocks on wood&gt;.  I got a pickup group lastnight and we clicked so well we did two in a row.  We finished the first one so fast that we got the "You are still resting from your last adventure" when leaer tryed to get a new one.

Stick with guild groups until you can group with people that aren't so much worried about the loot, and are more interested in the XP and AP.<br />_________________<br />Menas Darkenwood

I have. in fact, my mage is now lvl 56, and most LDoNs i do, i AM the looter, because of the bags i summon. Yes, if mage goes LD stuff will go poof, NO it does not happen immediately.
<br />

<br />
Mage would jsut need to get back in within 30 minutes. Last time i checked, ti doesnt take 30 minutes to loggin fomr a linkdead. . .
<br />
just letting you know. Oh yea, dont forget mages post 50 can use a skill called pet canni . . . basically we summon pet, reclaim pet gaining more mana than it took to cast, only works wiht very high HP pets. in ohter words, the mage can nuke all they want, if they go oom, so what, give em 2 to 3 minutes tops (depending on mana pool) and they will be ready to go again</span><span class="gentblsmall"></span></td>

				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Well, finally decided to find a specialist ranger place, so registered here. Here is my first post then:
<br />

<br />
Here are some LDON tips.
<br />

<br />
I've done 16 LDON, 10 successes, 6 "Failures".
<br />

<br />
2 "failures" were when a group member entered the Dungeon prematurely, Once because of a lag patch, and once because the person got agro from a brownie or something, didn't know where to go to zone to loose it, and thought 'Hey I'll just jump down the dungeon'. Never mind that they were the first folk person there and that CLR is still off getting a mana buff. So on both of these by the time the group was formed up and buffed we were 10 minutes or so down.
<br />

<br />
2 "failures" were on collection missions, getting that elusive last drop, with groups that overall were working OK, not brilliant, but well enough to work through the dungeon steadily. On one occasion we got the final drop from the mob we were fighting as the mission timed out, and so missed by about 15 seconds. On the other occasion, we were down one drop at time out, and it took a crazy number of mobs (20 or so!) to get the final one.
<br />

<br />
1 "failure" was when the group went sour because one member decided to change roles, without telling anyone, because they didn't like the way things were going, and so started pulling! With no warning or discussion! Now in fact, they had a valid point, the group wasn't working too well, but their response was disastrous.
<br />

<br />
The final "failure" I can't recall.
<br />

<br />
Now, first off, note I say "failure" in inverted commas. The reason for this is that every dungeon I've ever been in, I came out WAY ahead on XP, cash and loot, improved my knowledge of group tactics AND met some great folk. Even the sour group contained 4 people I'd happily go with again.  OK, so in some of them we just came away with consolation points only, or even with no points on 1 or 2 times, but so what? I really don't care about the leader board. As far as I'm concerned every dungeon I've done was a roaring success! Yipee!
<br />

<br />
Now don't get me wrong, its good to stay mission focused, but not to the extent of becoming blinkered about it, or causing offence to someone.
<br />

<br />
Secondly, most of these failures can be seen to have occurred at the organisational stage.
<br />

<br />
LDON groups need leadership. There just isn't time to run them by comittee. Every group I'm in, I try to make sure that everyone is clear about who is in charge. Of course, leadership is a tricky skill, not everyone has the life experience to do it well, the fact that you are level 65 and dripping Uber gear does not make you a leader. Tactics and interpersonal skills do that! Leadership is too huge a topic to discuss here, but some pointers:
<br />

<br />
Be realistic in your objective, in relation to what classes you have, and how well you know them. If you have a badly balanced pickup group, then don't choose a difficult mission. You are setting yourself up for failure. Yes, everyone would like to be in a perfectly balanced group of proven friends, but I feel you need to be prepared to go with what you've got, adjusting the task you choose to meet the groups ability. Better to get a few points, than to fail to get lots.
<br />

<br />
For organising your group, you need not just allocate roles, but also have a buff plan. I see a lot of mana wasted by people casting buffs that don't stack, or aren't appropriate ((and yes, I admit, it is often me doing the wasting!)). In a perfect world, everyone would know everyone elses buffs inside out, but being realistic this isn't going to happen. I've now made up some socials that describe the effects of my buffs, and ask people if they have anything better, or if they want any of mine. I then spell out exactly which buffs I am going to maintain on which people. As a ranger specific tip for the less experienced, take the time to look at druid buffs. As the two classes share a lot of spell lines, the potential for wasting mana is high when a ranger is grouped with a similar level druid.
<br />

<br />
Do your organisation before starting the timer. For best result, a group should be totally organised before getting the adventure. Don't rely on using the 30 minutes to do your organisation. The best thing to do is form your group, organise it, THEN get the adventure, move to the entrance AS A GROUP, particularly if you are young enough that the zone represents a threat, then when you arrive at the entrance its immediately into buffing, re-med followed by entry. If you sit around the entrance you can bet sooner or later someone will train you a mob. A temporary LD or RL interuption can also mess up waiting till then, and if you are all ready  with 25 minutes of entry time remaining, so much the better.
<br />

<br />
Once you enter, take a few seconds to give everyone a chance to get orientated and cast any zonal spells (pets etc). I strongly suggest going with automap ON, and taking 15 seconds to add a label saying ENTRANCE in big letters! Then minimise, not close, the map window.
<br />

<br />
Then get going. However, take the time for frequent SHORT breaks. Your mana regen rate is essentially fixed (unless someone has an unreplaceable buff that is about to time out). I just don't see the point in pushing on till everyone is OOM, and then having a long break. That way if you have a bad pull there is nothing in reserve. As far as I can see, it makes more sense to med a little and often, which also gives small time windows for topping up short duration buffs, and fine tuning tactics. This requires positive control by the leader, getting people to report their mana condition regularly so you know when to rest, and when to start again, where possible getting people with higher mana to prop up those with lower. E.G. ranger top up healing can really help if the CLR is struggling. Finally make sure your lull/pull team don't restart until you are ready, and everyone is aware pulling is recommencing.
<br />

<br />
If things aren't going well:
<br />

<br />
Stop pulls. Whatever the time pressure, stop. Figure out if the problem can be fixed. Take as long as it takes to organise that. Resist the presure to go off half cocked again.
<br />

<br />
If the problem can't be fixed, essentially if you realise that the mission is too tough for the capabilities of your group, then you need to be realistic, and get what you can out of the dungeon instead of rushing on blindly with everyone OOM and buffs fading to a Total Wipe Out. Grab XP and loot instead.
<br />

<br />
I strongly recommend against (in assasination missions) lulling your way to the target  through multiple uncleared rooms. Think about it, if your group was too weak to get there in reasonable time, the odds are you will struggle to win the fight, and will want a clear escape route.
<br />

<br />
For myself, I prefer to avoid deaths. Yes, ok, you can rez back most of the lost XP, but not what you could have earned in the time wasted doing the rez itself. Its not like a dungeon is a raid for an epic piece that you've spent weeks organising the folks to show up for, though I appreciate others may feel differently on that point. Yes, sometime people die when pulls go bad, whatever the starting condition, but that is different to pushing a bad position.
<br />

<br />
Finally, the completing an LDON is all about being willing to be flexible, and using all the groups abilities to the maximum efficiency. If you've done 10 dungeons successfully, doing X,Y,Z every time, that doesn't mean that the next groups make up might be a bit different and you might need to modify your individual actions. You need to be flexible, and responsive to the other group members, polite in suggesting changes, and non defensive if someone suggests you do something different.
<br />
