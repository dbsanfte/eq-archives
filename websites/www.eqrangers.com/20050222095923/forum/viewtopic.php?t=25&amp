				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">In an effort to support EQRangers through this nightmare, I'm going to devote a half hour of my time to start a topic that every ranger should be well-schooled in, the art of kiting.
<br />

<br />
There are three basic types of kiting:  Fear-kiting, Aggro-kiting, and Bow-kiting.  Most rangers start with a basic Fear-kite and work their way up as their levels and survivability increase.  Below are detailed the basic tools of each, as well as some techniques to improve your skill and durability in the process.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">FEAR KITING</span></span> earns it's name because it relies heavily on the use of fear...or, more specifically, Panic Animal, a spell that rangers acquire at level 22.  The basic technique is to pull a mob to an open area, snare it, and then panic it.  As the mob runs away, you attack it from behind, effectively causing damage to the mob while taking minimal or no damage yourself.
<br />

<br />
Rangers are fully capable of this at level 22.  However, it is highly recommended that you not begin using this as an exclusive means of leveling until level 30, when you acquire the spell Spirit of the Wolf, which will greatly increase your survivability in a solo siituation if things happen to go wrong.  In addition, it is advisable to have a root and preferably at least one DOT (damage over time) spell at the ready, for crowd control and added damage capability.  Keep in mind that if other creatures add into your fight, it becomes much more difficult to control, as you then have to juggle keeping two different opponents snared and feared...therefore, it is advisable to get your target clear from any potential assistance as quickly as possible, which usually means a bowshot, with a follow-up snare once he's clear.  If worse comes to worse, don't be afraid to toss two quick fears and head for a zoneline.  Better to run away and survive than to die.
<br />

<br />
The advantages of this method - quick, reliable means of levelling, little downtime (usually for mana instead of health), and no assistance required.  The main disadvantage is that Panic Animal works only on, well, animals, and thus you have a limited selection of areas at which to practice your trade.  Recommended are Marus Seru, Dawnshroud Peaks, Jaggedpine Forest, and Natimbi, in increasing order of difficulty.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">AGGRO KITING</span></span> - This method is very effective for levelling when your group is lacking a good tank or healer, as it involves causing maximum damage to your opponent while taking minimal damage yourself.  Essentially, the ranger pulls an enemy and then holds aggro, running around to keep the mob trailing after him and possibly shooting it with arrows while the rest of his group follows the mob, hacking away at it.  Best used when a single pull is easily accomplished, although experienced rangers at high levels can manage aggro-kites of over a dozen mobs in the right situations.
<br />

<br />
The basic technique is to pull your enemy using a bowshot until he's clear of any potential assistance, and into a wide open area before hitting him with snare, and then repeatedly use the level 9 spell Flame Lick to keep aggro while the rest of your group attacks the mobs in melee or with spells.  Flame Lick draws an AMAZING amount of aggro for it's casting time, mana cost, and level, and provided you stop once every 5-10 seconds to toss it at the mob, you should have no trouble holding aggro.  Keep your distance...in the areas where this is really beneficial to a party, random hits can be extremely painful, and a stun at the wrong time could be fatal.  If one of your group members gains aggro, immediately stop and toss a few Flame Licks to try regaining it, shooting in between.  If that fails to regain aggro, join the fight and repeat until you regain it or the mob dies.
<br />

<br />
This method carries with it many of the advantages of fear-kiting, but carries one major liability - you MUST be in a group to take advantage of it.  Even if that group consists of you and a rogue, this cannot be done solo.  It is, however, effective in places where the natives are not animals, and can be done indoors, although the limited maneuverability in many dungeons makes this tricky at best.  Again, keep Spirit of Wolf up at all times, and use Snare to minimize your opponent's running speed to keep well ahead of him.  Done right, you should never take a hit.  This method is also known to some as Rabbit Kiting, so named because of the Rabbit running away from the predator(s).
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">BOW KITING</span></span> -  Almost solely reserved for higher level rangers, this is a method employed usually when a ranger has little or no assistance, and can be used in times of desperation (during a bad pull, for example).  It involves hitting the mob with snare (noticing a pattern here?) and then keeping ahead of it, unloading arrow after arrow into it.  At lower levels, while possible, this is an extremely inefficient way of killing, as you will run out of arrows sooner or later.  It becomes a truely beautiful (and viable) alternative at level 59, when the ranger gains access to the Endless Quiver AA ability, negating this disadvantage.  It can (and usually is, to some extent) combined with Aggro-Kiting if the Ranger is in a group, but it is completely workable solo, so long as arrows are not a concern.  The main disadvantage to this method, assuming you have Endless Quiver, is that it involves running backwards, which can be hazardous if you step into a pool of lava, back off the edge of a cliff, or run into a mob who you couldn't see.  Definitely know your zone if you do this.  Archery Mastery, Endless Quiver, capped dexterity and archery skill, and a killer bow and arrow selection makes this method truely beautiful for the skilled ranger who cannot seem to find a group.
<br />

<br />
A fourth method that cannot be considered true kiting, as it does not involve the movement of a mob, is the Root and Shoot method.  In this method, after the mob is snared, he is then rooted, and then arrows are driven into it, along with DOTs if mood or mana dictates, until the mob dies.  Often used by very high level rangers who have acquired Headshot, a skill capable of a one-hit kill, even on a rooted mob, and carries one of the same disadvantages of Bow-Kiting...the arrow deficit.  Still, as long as one is not fighting a caster (and if you're fighting a caster, you should be in melee anyway, to deal damage and disrupt casting), it is an almost risk-free way of killing, only becoming hazardous on mobs that resist root or that have friends around.  And a Ranger should know his enemies' strengths and weaknesses in advance, so this is usually not an issue unless one is careless.
<br />

<br />
Hopefully, this contribution to the rebuilding of the wealth of resources available on EQRangers will prove to be a beneficial learning experience for new rangers, and perhaps a refresher for some older ones.<br />_________________<br />Jhanus Garith,  Pathfinder of Tunare on Druzzil Ro, 54th Season
