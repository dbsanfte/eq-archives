				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Andraes stalked the ancient forest of Kelithin, a manifestation that stayed hidden in the shadows. Something was not right, a light tickle in the base of his skull warned him profusely. That’s why he volunteered to check out the crushbone entrance, and if possible, enter. It was a two mile trek from the small outpost, and dawn was only an hour or so off. He was only a half mile or so downwind, and he descended to a slower pace, careful to avoid the small orc camps outside of it. Not because he feared them, but because he never risked chance of discovery.
<br />
	For some instinctive reason he stopped, looking around. It took him a few moments to realize he it wasn’t a hidden adversary he was looking for, but he didn’t smell orcs. Rather a new smell, not entirely new, he was positive he’d been around it before. Very carefully he circled around, taking him an extra half n’ hour to come in site of the fires. The veteran ranger felt fear seep into his heart, it wasn’t the usual dumb orcs that gathered around the fires, instead scores of Teir’Dal all stood at attention facing an imposing figure that drew attention to itself. A lifetime of hatred burned in his being, and he felt a ridiculous urge to attack with his bow. But even he wasn’t so arrogant, no ranger no matter how great couldn’t stay hidden from so many skilled foes for long.
<br />
	Dvane stood in his planar amour, baring Innoruuks Voice in his right hand, feeding off of the hatred the epic weapon secreted. This battle was trivial, and he doubted his presence was needed to insure victory, he wanted to make a statement. He hadn’t stepped foot in these lands in over five decades, in which he led a small raiding band, obliviating a score of villages in a week, selling the women in children off as slaves. Just to let them know he could strike whenever he wanted, however he wanted. And he would let them know he was back, and nothing could stop him, where his forefathers had failed he would succeed. 
<br />
	“You all know why you’re here…” the venomous voice of the elf broke the silence of early dawn.
<br />
	The troops nodded and murmured in agreement, it was an indescribable honor to be in the presence of Lord General Dvane II. He was worshipped more than even the king; his militant style of life charmed his people. He promised them redemption from their past failures, and for some reason, they put their trust once again into him, as they had his father.
<br />
	“You, and your fellow brethren, are the ones chosen by me and closest advisors, to open the way for the army that will finally,” he paused, emphasis on the last word “Give us what we have devoted nearly our entire existence to, the destruction of the Feir’Dal’ people, and our ancestral homelands.”
<br />
	Nearly a hundred shadowknights and necromancer roared in approval, their skeletal minions thumping their chest in rhythm to each other. The sight of the loyalty and devotion to such a demonic cause cast fear into the wood elf spying from the woods. He studied the figure which had been a source of stories used to frighten mischievous children, and the subject of many pub conversations for a century. Dvane is headed towards kelethin, Dvane is after the king and queen, so much that that he was fixed with a stereotype, a barbaric looking dark elf, with yellow fangs and long tangled hair. He found this to be quite the opposite, he held a look of composure on his imposing face. His hair was long and white, combed behind sharp ears, and two intelligent yellow orbs surfed the crowd, his mouth bearing the slightest hint of long canines, his sharp nose, twitching ever so softly.
<br />
	Then he did a very unexpected, and unnerving thing, for a second he looked, and grinned at Andraes, a forboding expression, one that showed no fear. But the wood elf kept his composure, glaring into the dark beings eyes. He felt no fear, only hatred, hatred for what he had done to his family nearly half a century ago. And with that he was off, falling back into the shadows he began to gracefully hop from tree branch to tree branch, only a rustling of leaves to the small orc villages he passed.
<br />
	He had no idea how his brothers outpost could stop them, they were nearly outnumbered two to one, he would send someone off immediately to kelethin, it would take three days atleast for any help to arrive, and only if a druid gated their and help left immediately. Mean while, he intended to help his brother and companions hold out. The significance of what he had just witnessed did not go unheeded in his mind, for the second time in a thousand years, his people would be forced into a catastrophic war with their distant cousins.    
<br />
---------------------                 ---------------------------                     --------------
<br />

<br />
	The guardsman peered through the fog from the tower, his sharp elven eyes searching, as he had nearly been doing for an hour. Ever since Andraes had notified them of a Teir’Dal unit. 
<br />
	“hide yourselves,” he shouted only loud enough so that the 3 score of rangers and druids hidden amongst the tree’s heard. Almost at once the glimmer of dozens of shadows sinking into nothingness flashed across the scenery.
<br />
	He could see them marching as coherently a force can in woods, a significantly dressed elf leading them. The force was covered in a black veil that was their armor, shafts of early sunlight shone through the trees illuminating the fog. With out warning dozens of arrows poured down on them, instinctively they through up shields or scrambled out of the way, after that all hell broke loose. Rangers and druids dropped from the trees rushing at the enemy wielding their class’s innate weapons.
<br />
	Andraes fought wildly, falling most that met him with one sweep, he felt cold hands grip his neck from behind him, fastly cutting off his oxygen supply. He twisted his neck around to see a giant skeletal minion lifting him into the air, and a devious dark elf wrapped in red robes murmuring an incantation. Andraes fought to suppress a scream threatening to escape from his lips. He felt the poison trying to enter his body and his armor and innate will to live fighting it off. He brought his knee into the bony chest, a resounding crack reverberated through his ears and he dropped to the dirt, rolling away and clawing at his throat. 
<br />
	The skeletal being knew no pain, only the pleasure it received when doing his creators bidding. It lunged towards him only to have a pommel slammed into its head, stunning it, andraes took this time to call upon nature, simultaneously two thick roots leapt from the ground entwining themselves tightly around the bony ankles. Notching in a carefully aimed arrow he let it loose, a feather light stick of death that flew through the skeletons ribs and into the dark elfs chest who was hastily casting a shadow step spell. With a shriek it fell to the earth, its pet evaporating into the air. 
<br />
	Screams and shrieks arose from his left and he turned to see a group a rangers fleeing before the dark elf that had seen him earlier. He grabbed one by the neck squeezing until her face was a dark red and stream of blood shot out from her right eye, before he could kill her a shaft of lightning alluminated the forest, bearing down on his small frame. He dropped her, she would die soon enough, he watched her clawing at her throat, long red hair matted to her forhead and eyes staring franticly into his face, asking for pity. He laughed, a horrible guttural sound that reverberated through the forest, he took his sword and lunged into the air, sliding it into a druids back. Then taking the pleasure of pulling it slowly out, he loved the way the blood trickled, then gushed onto his tan skin, the look suited him much better. He was looking for his next victim when he saw a ranger staring at him, hate clouding his hazel eyes as he gripped his earthcaller, he recognized him as the scout he’d seen a few hours before. With a descisive air about him he walked towards the ranger, sword at his side, a lopsided grin on his face. He stopped in front of him, their chests only inches apart, a few of the soldiers around them stopped to watch the confrontation. 
<br />
	Dvane opened his mouth to speak, he hadn’t even taken in his breath when a sword came flying at his head. He nimbly dodged and danced back out of reach, giving the ranger another lopsided grin. “Close…very close,” with that he stepped in swinging his sword with both arms, the collaboration sent the small ranger stumbling backwards, the vibrations rattling his hands. He lunged forward this time his hand held out, glowing an unearthly color, andraes tried to jump back but was to slow, he felt the finger tip brush his cheek, and ungodly pain sweeping through his body. He would of gave up their, but his comrades were watching, and if they saw him defeated or run, then it wouldn’t be long before they gave in. Instead he screamed and swung both swords in a combination at the Teir’dal, who either blocked or side step.
<br />
	Andraes grimaced, to most it looked like he had the elf on the defensive, but he knew what was happening. He was being toyed with, and humiliated, he brought his foot to the elfs chest, knocking him back and lunged on him, his earthcaller stopped inches from the elfs face by Innurroks Voice (shadowknight epic). He never saw the the</span><span class="gentblsmall"></span></td>
