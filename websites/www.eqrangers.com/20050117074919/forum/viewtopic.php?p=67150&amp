				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Cries of fear. and despair rose into the night air, the stench of blood and bloated corpses made the scene thick with the smell of death. The dark raiders from the north had ravaged the small village, and fear had become part of life.
<br />
	Lying in a clove of thorn bushes was a young boy, shame, fear, and disgust all fought for ground inside of his being. He had been the first and only defender of the small villa too run, and the shame and horror that it was too late to make any change in the outcome was too much. His eyes burned with tears and dirt, and he felt an exhaustion that one can only feel from the constant flinching at death, and the uncontrollable fear that threatened to consume him when he saw a black boot walk silently by. He thought of his father and his unusually pale skin, the thought that it might now be splattered with blood, or the next cry of death could be him made silent sobs ravage his body. In the midst of his thoughts of horror and fear his exhaustion caught up with him, its surprising how easily one can sleep under such conditions.
<br />
	Several hours later he awoke with the sun and crawled out too intake the scene before him. Nothing could of prepared him. The first thing that hit him was the stench, and he sat clutching his stomach and dry heaving for several minutes before getting himself under control. The next was the dozens of bodies everywhere, bloated with mouths gaping open and cold pale eyes that stared through him at something he couldn’t see. As he made his way down the blood splattered dirt road his foot caught on something. When he looked down he screamed and tripped trying too get away, a young woman was lying over a child with a score of stab wounds in her back. He felt something crawling down his cheek, he touched it only too pull his wet finger away and realize he’d been crying. Every now and then a nude woman spotted the ground where they’d been raped before or perhaps even after they’d felt the cold bite of steel.
<br />
	When he came to his homes doorway several dark elves lay dead on the ground, undoubtedly where his father had made his last stand. He’d always had a morbid fascination with death, and when he discussed this with his family he was told he was a fool, and when he became a man and fought for his country he’d understand why. Now he did as he looked down on his fathers blood splattered face, he would never admit it then but he found the way the dark brown dried blood laid across the pale white skin had a majestic beauty to it. As he entered the small room he saw his mother sprawled across the floor, he bent over and caressed her cold, clammy skin, whispering over and over again “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry,” as if it would bring her back. As his eyes traveled down ward a loud body heaving sob escaped from his lips as he beheld the wound that lay across her large belly and had killed her and his unborn sibling.  
<br />
	“Andraes…?”
<br />
	“Dionysius!” He scrambled over his mothers dead body, and ran toward the sound, what he found was a small elf, with milky white hair and eyes, inherited from their father. There was a gaping hole in his arm and a gash across his forehead, when his eyes fell across it his brother chuckled.
<br />
	“At least its not a belly wound huh?”
<br />
	Andraes smiled feebly and helped him sit up, he tore a small piece of cloth off his stained tunic and wrapped it around his arm, he was no medic and Dionysius winced at the rough work.
<br />
	“Sorry, good thing I’m not a cleric, how’d you survive?”
<br />
	“They left me as a message for our people, they said there’d be thousands more too come soon after, and King Amines would see the stupidity in denying them their old territories…what about you…” Andaes knew he knew what had happened and he looked stubbornly away suddenly becoming very interested in the wooden beam work of the ceiling. 
<br />
	“I would of done the same thing at fifteen…”
<br />
	Shame filled his face and he felt the blood rushing too his cheeks, he knew Dionysius would of never of run, the thought probably wouldn’t even had crossed his mind. His father was constantly complimented on what a wonderful son he had in Dionysius, maybe even general material.
<br />
	“Reckon the king will call on the humans for their support, it can’t be ignored,” 
<br />
	“Perhaps, perhaps,” Andraes whispered, glad for the change of subject, and amazed that such a trivial thing as his dignity even mattered to him at the moment.			
<br />
	Andraes took a deep breath and began the task of tying the cloth around his arm and controlling his trembling hands, it was amazing how quickly ones life could be turned up side down, how stories of the same thing happening had seemed so far away from him, something that couldn’t reach him. He helped his brother up and looked grimly at him, they both knew what task laid ahead, one they hadn’t expected to be performed for decades. Dionysius grabbed a crude shovel and handed it to andraes who stared shell-shocked at it for several minutes before coming back to himself.
<br />
	“Brother…” Dionysius called softly to him, but andraes was not to be fooled, his voice was slurred with anger and malice, “Before the week is over, we’ll have extracted our revenge…”
<br />
	Andraes nodded numbly, not really taking in the words, he knew there was no way him and his brother could make any lasting effect on the Tier’Dal that could compensate for their parents and unborn siblings death.
<br />

<br />

<br />
	The sun was setting low in the trees, and the constant song of the crickets made him drowsy, but there was no way he or his brother could sleep right now, they had been standing side by side for nearly an hour staring at the large mound of dirt, in which laid his life and love, each grieving in their own way, sometimes an unexpected sob escaping from one of them. After several minutes Andraes turned and began to walk away, not waiting for his brother to catch up nor noticing the smell of smoke in the air, until he turned around and saw his brother running to him, and the villa ablaze.
<br />
	“why’d you…?”
<br />
	“That’s a far better fate for their bodies then sitting in the sun for a fortnight.”
<br />
	Andraes nodded, solemnly agreeing, he never looked back at his home only ahead, and the throbbing voice in the back of his head telling him that once he made it to kelethin, he could join the army, show his brother and the world that he was no coward, that he was indeed his fathers son kept him going.
