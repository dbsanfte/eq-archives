<br />
	The forest was dark that night.  The perpetual moisture in the air was so thick, one could barely see their hand in front of their face.  Still, I walked between the trees with confidence.  Just as I did not have to see my hand to know what it looked like, I did not have to see the paths or the trees to know my way.
<br />
	Even so, the darkness of the forest and the silence of the creatures that inhabited it worried me.  But in my longing to be home, I ignored the silent warning of the forest.
<br />
	Finally, after what seemed a journey of a thousand miles, I came clear of the thickest part of the trees and looked upon my home.  Looked up at it to be more precise. Among some of the tallest and mightiest trees in the Greater Faydark, my people made their home.  Buildings carefully and lovingly fitted to the trees, shaped by druidic magics, even the limbs of the trees served as floor, ceiling, and walls to our dwelling places. Carefully concealed rope bridges and wooden ramps, invisible to the untrained eye from the ground, connected the houses and buildings of my home, the Wood Elven city of Kelethin.
<br />
	Sighing with relief, I trotted towards one of only three lifts leading up to the city.  When the guards stationed at the bottom of the lift saw me, they moved their hands to the hilts of their swords, a suspicious look in their eyes.  They relaxed when I pulled back the hood of my forest green cloak, revealing ice blue eyes, many shaded blond hair, and the sharp features that only an Elf possesses.  As a ranger, I often walked alone and in secret, so it came as no surprise that I was not recognized at first, with the hood of my cloak pulled up to hide my face. 
<br />
	I stepped onto the lift and rode up into the city.  The branches of the trees gently caressed my face, welcoming me home.  As the lift slowly made its way up, my thoughts wandered back to the mission I had just returned from.
<br />
	It had been short, as they go, but it had been important.  I had traveled to the Lesser Faydark, a smaller, darker version of the Greater.  My mission had been to contact the ranger outpost there, to find out why there had been no word for weeks.
<br />
	My mind was forced to slip back to the present when the lift reached the top, which was actually the lowest level of the city.
<br />
	I gave a nod to the guards at the top.  &#8220;Is Maesyn here?&#8221;  Maesyn Trueshot was the guild master of Faydark&#8217;s Champions, the ranger&#8217;s guild.
<br />
	&#8220;Aye,&#8221; one of the guards replied.  &#8220;He is in the guild house waiting for you.&#8221;
<br />
	Laughing, I executed a small bow.  It came as no surprise that Maesyn knew I had returned, his contacts throughout the forest, birds and animals, would have spotted me long before I reached my home city.  &#8220;My thanks.&#8221;
<br />
	The guards smiled and bid me farewell.  I hurried off to the guild house, not even having to think about the way my feet went.  I knew the way so well, I could have walked it blindfolded.
<br />
	I called greetings to my ranger brothers and sisters as I walked through the great double doors.  The bow and arrow that was carved into the wall was supposed to bring good luck to any ranger that touched, so I brushed my hand across it as I walked in.
<br />
	&#8220;Welcome back, Jellica,&#8221; Dillorin Fireshine said, his greeting echoed by many others.
<br />
	Ranarie Sunfire, my cousin, waved me over.  &#8220;Maesyn is in there,&#8221; she said, motioning to the door behind her.  Then she hugged me. &#8220;We missed you.&#8221;  Then a serious expression came over her face.  She opened her mouth as if to ask me a question, but I cut her short.
<br />
	&#8220;You&#8217;ll find out later, Ran, Maesyn needs to know first.&#8221;  She just rolled her eyes and flashed me a wry grin.  She stepped away from the door so that I could go in.  I knocked and went in without waiting for an answer.
<br />
	I had always loved being in this room.  A handful of portraits of rangers from the past were hung on the walls, and a small collection of swords and bows adorned them as well.  These mighty weapons had belonged to the rangers in the portraits.  In the center of the small room, a large oak table, seeming nearly too large for the room, held dozens of maps, some rolled up and others weighted down at the corners.  Around the table were three plain wood, straight-backed chairs. Two windows were on the east and north walls.  Other than that, the room was bare.  Its simplicity is what made it so charming, I thought.
<br />
	Maesyn was leaning on the table, his golden, hawk-like eyes shining in the dim torchlight, his jet-black hair gleamed.
<br />
	&#8220;You have news for me,&#8221; he said more than asked.
<br />
	I dipped into a low bow, then rose and nodded.  &#8220;About three weeks ago, the ranger outpost in the Lesser Faydark was attacked by four score of Orcs.&#8221; Maesyn&#8217;s eyes widened at this news, but he did not interrupt me.  &#8220;Many were injured, but thank Tunare, none of our people were lost.  Captain Strongbow was unable to spare anyone to make the run here because of how thin the defenses are with so many wounded.  He assures me though that nearly the whole Orcish force was annihilated,&#8221; I added with a wicked grin.
<br />
	Maesyn smiled grimly, then took a moment to collect his thoughts.  After a moment, he said, &#8220;Jellica, send someone to Master Heartwood, I would like to request that he sends a few druids to the Lesser Faydark.  Then send someone else to Master Regren, hopefully he will be in a good mood and will consent to send some warriors to the outpost with the druids.  I will see if any rangers would be willing to make the journey as well.&#8221;  He smiled at me.  &#8220;After you have sent the two runners, you can go get some sleep.  Thank you for doing this, we owe you much.&#8221;
<br />
	I shrugged the complement off.  &#8220;No need to thank me, it&#8217;s all part of the job.&#8221;  Then I turned on my heel, left the room, and went about my last two jobs for the night.
<br />

<br />
	One hour later, I finally climbed up the last ramp to my house.  I had sent a young Elf to the druid guild house.  Master Heartwood was known as a benevolent and amiable Wood Elf, but I knew that Master Regren was another matter all together.  So I had taken it upon myself to go and speak with the usually taciturn and curt guild master.  Surprisingly, he had been more receptive to Maesyn&#8217;s request than I had thought, but it had still taken some persuading on my part to get him to send a dozen warriors to accompany the druids to the ranger outpost.  I had come away from that meeting nearly asleep on my feet, negotiating with Master Regren was no easy feat.  But I came away satisfied.
<br />
	As I plodded across the last rope bridge, I briefly thought of visiting my parents, but then a yawn overcame me, nearly cracking my jaw.  &#8220;Forget that idea,&#8221; I muttered to myself as I slipped in through my door.  I unbuckled my sword belt and put it on the back of a chair, then kicked off my boots.  As I crawled into bed and pulled the covers up, I mumbled to myself, &#8220;A good ranger always sleeps with his clothes on.&#8221;  Mere moments later, I was running through the forests of my dreams.
<br />

<br />
	I woke to the smell of smoke in the air.  I climbed out of bed and ran to the front door and threw it open.  The city was on fire!  At first my sleep-dulled mind did not comprehend, but then a scream floated to me on the air. . . not a scream that any fire could cause.  It was a death cry.  Then it hit me.  Kelethin was under attack!
<br />
	Nearly falling over myself, I scrambled back into my house.  I jumped into my boots, and buckled my sword belt back on.  Then I flew out the door, running as fast as I could to get to the lower levels.
<br />
	Images of my friends and family flashed through my mind, but I shoved them away.  If I did not reach the fighting, but took time to get to them and make sure they were safe, then that would be one less defender stopping the invaders, whatever they were.
<br />
	As I darted towards the final rope bridge before the lift, I saw a slender elven form running with his head down across the bridge towards me.  At first I thought he was one of my people, a noncombatant running away from the fighting.  Then the fact that his hair was stark white hit me.  I gasped, and at the sound, his head came up and my fears were confirmed.  His skin was so dark a blue, it was nearly black, his features were twisted into a cruel sneer, and his eyes glowed a faint red in the dark night, glowing with the infravision that all Elven kind possessed.  But this was no fair skinned Elf.
<br />
	&#8220;Teir`Dal!&#8221;  I hissed.  Suddenly all the pieces of the puzzle fell into place. The recent Orc attack, the darkness and the quiet of the forest.  The Orcs were the allies of the Dark Elves, and they had attacked the ranger outpost for the sole purpose of distracting the guild rangers in the Greater Faydark, the greatest scouts Kelethin had to offer.  The forest had been so quiet because of the presence of these unnatural creatures.  But I had ignored the warnings the forest had been trying to give us, we all had.
<br />
	My swords hissed as well when they came out of their sheaths.  &#8220;Prepare to die, foul scum,&#8221; I snapped.
<br />
	The vile Dark Elf just laughed and flashed me a grin.  &#8220;I would so love a chance to cross swords with a Wood Elf,&#8221; he said as he pulled a short sword and dirk from their scabbards.  &#8220;Unfortunately, I am looking for something and do not have time to waste on the likes of you.&#8221;  He dipped into a mocking bow, then turned and ran the other way.
<br />
	&#8220;Coward!&#8221; I screeched after him and gave chase.  When he turned at his end of the bridge to look back at me, I saw my death in his eyes.  &#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; I whispered, then I pumped my legs as fast as they could go.
<br />
	&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said the Dark Elf.  Then he hacked into the ropes securing the bridge to the other side.
<br />
	Mother Tunare, please let them hold! I prayed.  But they did not.  First one, then the other split, and I tumbled down, along with the bridge.
<br />
	&#8220;Good bye, little Elf,&#8221; he called down to me.  &#8220;I regret that our blades will never get a chance to cross.&#8221;
<br />
	I did not, I would not, give him the satisfaction of hearing me scream.  His face disappeared from the edge of the platform, and I knew he was off to find whatever it was he was searching for.  Still, his face was etched on my memory as if by acid, and I knew that not even in death would I forget it.  But then, as I looked desperately around, I saw my salvation.
<br />
	The bridge was falling right next to me, barely an inch out of my reach.  If I could only reach it. . .  quickly, I snapped my swords into their sheaths, then stretched, and my fingers finding a tentative a handhold.  I pulled myself in, wrapping the severed roped around my other arm, then I held on for dear life as I continued to plummet, but now I knew I would survive the fall.
<br />
	The jolt as the bridge reached the end of its rope nearly threw me from my perch.  But I held on, stubbornly holding tighter to the rope, and waited for the bridge to stop its swinging.  Then plank by plank, I climbed back up into the city.
<br />
	When I made it back to the top, I unsheathed my swords and looked around.  There was no one on this platform, or on the one that I had been trying to reach, but I heard all around me the sounds of battle.  Steel on steel, battle cries, and death screams.  I knew I was needed, and my feet started to run as if of their own accord.  I darted up one ramp, then turned right down another, arriving at the same platform I would have if it hadn&#8217;t been for that blasted Dark Elf.
<br />
	&#8220;Our blades will get a chance to cross,&#8221; and with that promise to myself, I followed the sound of a cry of fear to a small inn.  
<br />
	I kicked the door open, and quickly identified the screamer.  A young elven girl, no older than fifteen summers, had been cornered by a Dark Elf, his dagger poised and ready to be thrown into her heart.  She screamed again when she saw me, and the Dark Elf whirled around at the sound of the door crashing in.
<br />
	&#8220;That one will not be taken today,&#8221; I said, meaning the little one.  Before the Dark Elf could even move, my sword found his heart, seeming to have bloomed in his chest like a flower in spring.  He stared down in shock for a moment, and then he fell over, dead before he even hit the floor.
<br />
	The little girl started to cry then, her shoulders bouncing up and down in great heaving sobs.  I wrapped her in my arms, taking a moment to comfort her.  &#8220;You are safe now,&#8221; I whispered into her ear.  Then I led her into the back of the inn, where she hid underneath a bed.  &#8220;Do not come out until I come get you, or until you hear the sounds of victory and the silver trumpets of your kin.&#8221;
<br />
	She nodded, her bright green eyes glistening with tears held in check.  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;You saved my life.&#8221;
<br />
	I just smiled gently.  What else could I do?  &#8220;I must go out now, and help defend the city.  You stay here and be quiet.  Do not make a sound, else the Dark Elves will find you, and I will not be here a second time.&#8221;  Then I squeezed her hand, and left the inn, stepping over the dead Dark Elf.  I took a quick look around, to make sure no one saw me come out, then I went off in search of another kill.
<br />
	Barely a minute later, I found it, and a wide grin came to my face.  I had hoped to find him, and it seemed as if the elven gods knew my wishes, and smiled upon me.
<br />
	&#8220;My blades hunger to meet yours!&#8221; I called.  &#8220;Please, don&#8217;t disappoint them.&#8221;
<br />
	He turned around, slowly moving his gaze from the house he had just been about to enter, to my face.  &#8220;But you are d-dead. . .&#8221; he stammered, his face the perfect study of shock and bewilderment.  &#8220;I saw you die!&#8221;
<br />
	I chuckled grimly.  &#8220;No,&#8221; I corrected him, &#8220;you saw me fall.  You made a mistake in not sticking around to finish the job.  And this time, you will find that your tricks will not work so well.&#8221;
<br />
	After a moment, he calmed himself and shrugged.  &#8220;It seems I will have a little fun tonight after all.&#8221;  Then he pulled out his weapons.
<br />
	We began to circle one another, measuring each other up, looking for any weaknesses in the other&#8217;s defense.  He was the first to strike, but it was a lazy pass, and I deflected it easily.  The battle had not truly begun yet.
<br />
	&#8220;Why are you here?  What is it that you are searching for?&#8221;  I asked as I sent a careless swing at his left side.  He turned it away with ease.
<br />
	&#8220;Oh, the usual reasons.  You know, to kill, rape, loot, and destroy, nothing new really.  And what we are searching for is none of your business.&#8221;
<br />
	&#8220;Bet me,&#8221; I snarled.  I flicked my left-hand sword in a low swing, as the right came down in an overhand chop.  Both were deflected, but he winced a little at the force of my blows.
<br />
	&#8220;Well, if you must know. . .&#8221; my expression gave him the answer to that statement.  He nodded, and his teeth flashed in the dim light as he grinned,  &#8220;Very well.  It&#8217;s not like you will be around much longer to be able to tell anyone anyway. . .&#8221;
<br />
	The Teir`Dal had come to seize the guild masters.  All of them, including Maesyn.  The attack had been sanctioned by the clerics and necromancers of Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate, the evil god that had created the Dark Elves.
<br />
Long ago, Innoruuk had captured the first Elven King and Queen, then over a time of centuries tore them apart, both in body and in soul.  When Innoruuk&#8217;s foul work had been finished, he had recreated them into a more beautiful version of himself, but with all his hatred and evil wrapped up inside.  Thus he had created the Dark Elves, similar in appearance to the Wood Elves and High Elves, but with nearly black skin, and hair that was almost always stark white.  The Dark Elves thrived in their underground cities, their homes as dark as their hearts.
<br />
&#8220;I do not know exactly why they are needed,&#8221; my adversary mused, &#8220;perhaps for a sacrifice. . .&#8221; Then he attacked me, one, two, three, I blocked all three shots, but I knew the battle was about to begin for real.  &#8220;Unfortunately, I do not know where all the guild houses are, so I have not been able to capture any yet.  But believe me, I will.&#8221;  Then the cynical grin left his face.  &#8220;Enough friendly chat!&#8221;  he snarled, then he came at me in earnest.
<br />
For the first few seconds of battle, I was hard pressed to keep his weapons from finding a hole in my defense.  The news about the guild masters had shocked me, I never would have thought that&#8217;s what the Teir`Dal could have been after.  Finally, I gained my composure, instead of being pushed back constantly on my heels, I started to bear down on him, gaining the offensive.
<br />
I sent my left-hand sword in thrust towards his stomach, the right slashing across at neck level.  He parried the left one easily, pushing it aside, but he barely got his neck out of the way in time, and I still nicked him on the shoulder, my left sword also scoring a minor hit on his left bicep as it hurtled back in lighting fast.
<br />
The Dark Elf darted back, with usual Elven agility.  Then he came back in, a furious expression on his face.  His dirk reached out for my stomach, as his sword jabbed at my shoulder.  I batted the dirk aside, then stepped in, too quickly for him to react, and too close for his sword to be a factor.  I punched him in the stomach, one two, with the hilts of my swords.  Then I darted back out, as he reeled with the blows.
<br />
He swiped at me with his sword, merely buying himself time to get out of my reach.  He took a few steps back then studied me for a moment.  &#8220;So you do have some spirit. . .&#8221; he said quietly.  Then he spat at my feet.  &#8220;Well so do I!&#8221;  Then he leaped at me, his dirk and sword becoming a blur, working in perfect harmony.
<br />
	But my dark foe was not the only one well trained with his weapons.  I blocked a particularly hard pass, then slid my blade down his, shoving it out wide, at the same time locking our swords together at the hilt.  He could not stop me as I spun around behind him, his dirk too short to reach me.  My right-hand sword slashed across his backing, scoring a vicious hit that ripped through his armor, and he cried out in pain.  I did not waste time gloating, but quickly danced out of reach, flipping our blades apart in the process.
<br />
	He glared at me for a moment, his expression thoughtful.  Then, off in the distance, we both heard the voices of trumpets uplifted in song.  The Feir`Dal, my people, had defeated the wretched Dark Elves, and they were sounding out their victory for all to hear.  I cheered as well, and turned upon my opponent.  &#8220;Now you shall die,&#8221; I said vehemently, but he merely sighed in disappointment.
<br />
	&#8220;It seems as if our fun is to be ended prematurely,&#8221; he said, with an honest look of regret on his indigo features.  He winced as he sheathed his weapons, and I knew that the hit I had scored on his back pained him deeply.  He swept into a low bow, and I could find no hint of sarcasm in it.  &#8220;Until next time, little Elf.  Don&#8217;t do anything stupid like getting yourself killed between now and our next meeting.&#8221;  He reached into his belt pouch, pulling out something I could not see.  I hesitated for just a moment, and that moment was too long.  He threw whatever he was holding to the ground, and a flash of light and thick, noxious smoke immediately followed a loud bang.
<br />
	I reeled back, hacking on the foul smelling fumes, my eyes watering.  I looked around through my tears, but the Teir`Dal was gone, fleeing during the distraction his smoke had provided him.  I swore, some words coming out of my mouth that a hardy Barbarian would have blanched at.  But still I knew I was needed, so I stumbled down to the lower levels where the main fighting had happened.
<br />
	As I made my way downward, I had to stop my tears from flowing even freer than they already were.  All about me trees, buildings, and everything flammable burned.  The city, although it had stood, had taken heavy damage.  But the immense damage was nothing compared to the loss of lives.  The dead and dying were strewn all around, Feir`Dal and Dark Elves, some cried out for loved ones or for help for their pain, others, too far gone in their suffering, just whimpered.  Some would never again make a sound.  The stench of blood and death floated through the air, nearly making me gag, the heat of the flames beat on my skin, and all about me, the cries of victory, and of death.  It was almost too much for me to take, but I forced myself to ignore it, and went to work, helping those that I could.  Those among the wounded who had not been hurt too badly also moved among those that had.
<br />
	I paused to consider one downed Dark Elf, her eyes clouded over in pain, barely conscious.  My instincts cried out for me to kill her mercilessly, as she and her kind had come to do to me and mine.  But my heart said no.  To kill a helpless person was not my way, and I would not give into the hatred that welled inside me.  But neither would I ease her suffering until the wounds of my people had been seen to.
<br />
	
<br />
	An hour, then another, crept by, and still there were injured to heal.  As the minutes passed, I used what small healing magics I had, easing the agony into a dull ache, but I did not have enough power to fix the most grievous wounds.  The druids of the city were down on the forest floor, where the fighting had begun, caring for the Wood Elves who had been so completely surprised by the initial attack.  At first, my companions and I didn&#8217;t know what to do.  We looked at each other, trying to figure out whom to send to beg for assistance.  Then I felt a tug on my sleeve.  It was the Elfling I had saved from the inn; her face streaked with soot and tears, her red hair very much out of order.  But from the look on her face, I could tell she knew what we needed.
<br />
	&#8220;I will go and get help,&#8221; she promised me.  Then she looked to my right, at a Wood Elf with sandy blond hair and a scar on the left side of his face that went from temple to chin laying unconscious on the floor. A crossbow bolt had been shot into and through his thigh, but that was one of only several serious wounds he had received in defense of the city.  &#8220;My Da needs me to help you,&#8221; she said, fighting the words out through a sob.  I just nodded, amazed at the courage of this young Elf, and she scampered off, to find help for her Da, for all the wounded.
<br />
	As I watched her rush off, I felt the eyes of the four other Elves with me on my back.  I turned around to regard them, but when no one voiced the question that was obviously on all their minds, I snapped, &#8220;What?&#8221;
<br />
	None of them seemed to want to answer my question, but finally one young Elf, barely old enough to have been allowed into battle, stepped forward.  He sheepishly ran his hand through his pale yellow hair, and looked around for support.  When no one else said anything, he cleared his throat.  &#8220;Can we trust the girl to do what she said she would?  She looked scared, like as if she would bolt at the first loud sound . . . or something,&#8221; he finished lamely.
<br />
	I nodded, but I knew that was not the main thing on their minds.  I waited patiently for a moment, as the pale haired youth worked up the courage to ask the more pressing question.  &#8220;Why are we allowing these Dark Elves to live?&#8221;
<br />
	I stared at him in shock for a moment.  Even though I had asked myself the same question, I thought they would have figured it out themselves by now, and not left the Dark Elves alone simply because I had told them to.  Fixing a glare on all of them, I said, &#8220;It is not our way to kill someone that is helpless.  You know that, all of you do.&#8221;
<br />
	&#8220;But&#8212;&#8220; the spokesman started to say, but I cut him short with a sharp snap of my hand.
<br />
	&#8220;It is not our way.&#8221;  And I stared him down until he backed off.  &#8220;Now get back to work, all of you, so that the wounded can stand the pain until the healers come.&#8221;  All four of them nodded, and went back in amongst the wounded.
<br />
	Walking over to the young girl's father, a vague recollection of seeing him in the guild house came to me.  Then he was a ranger, like me.  Someone that knew the ways of nature as intimately as any druid, could use their weapons as well as any warrior, and had the skills to go around unseen that any rogue or thief would be jealous of.  Nodding in approval, I knelt down by him.
<br />
	&#8220;You have a brave little daughter,&#8221; I murmured to him.  As I reached for his hand, I closed my eyes and traveled deep into myself.  I found the little blue spark of my magic, and gently fanned it into a cerulean flame.  Shaping the flame with my will to become a gentle wave of healing energy, I sent it to him through our connected hands.  Opening my eyes, I was mesmerized by the blue warmth spreading over him from our linked fingers.  Soon, the look of pain eased from his face, and he fell into a natural sleep.  
<br />
I held on as long as I could, but my magic had been at work for hours, and I was exhausted.  Falling back onto my rump, I gasped for breath.  Those who had no tiny flame of magic inside would scoff at the idea that using magic could tire one just as much, if not more, than swinging a heavy sword in battle.  They had no idea how wrong they were, and I had done both this day.  I groaned and wished to the Mother of All that I could just let myself sleep.
<br />
	After a moment of rest, I clambered back to my feet and stretched.  I yelped in shock as I was nearly knocked back down by a red topped blur.  I chucked as the little Elfling hugged me.  &#8220;I went and got them for you,&#8221; she panted, &#8220;they are coming!&#8221;
<br />
	&#8220;Many thanks,&#8221; I said, beaming a smile down at her.  &#8220;You&#8217;re a hero,&#8221; I added with a wink.  She giggled, then wandered over to sit by her father.
<br />
	Two minutes later, five druids arrived, Iryana Greenleaf at their head.  Iryana was the second highest ranked druid in the city, second guild master of the Soldiers of Tunare, the druid guild.  In her silver eyes, a saw a look of profound sadness, and I knew that look would be mirrored in the eyes of all the inhabitants of Kelethin.  So many lives had been lost that day, and there had been no reason for it.
<br />
	Iryana came over to talk to me for a moment, while the druids went about their healing work.
<br />
	&#8220;We are sorry that we did not come earlier, but there was much to be seen to on the forest floor.&#8221;
<br />
	&#8220;It&#8217;s not a problem, Iryana, thank you for responding as quickly as you did.  What are we to do with the Dark Elves, though?  Kelethin has no real prisons in which to hold them.&#8221;
<br />
	Shrugging, she replied, &#8220;I do not know, the head guild masters will be the ones to decide that I am sure.  In the mean time, we are to tend to their wounds, but not awaken them.  I see that is what you and those with you have done.&#8221;
<br />
	&#8220;Aye,&#8221; I said with a nod, &#8220;but we did not know how to handle them.&#8221;  I yawned then, and I thought for a moment that my jaw would break.
<br />
	Iryana smiled at me.  &#8220;You are free to go home and rest, and the others may as well.&#8221;  We bowed to one another, then she turned away, ready to begin her work.
<br />
	I yawned again, and after making sure that I was no longer needed, I began the journey back up to my house, and more importantly, to my bed.<br />_________________<br /><IMG SRC=http://www.miamihost.net/ims/u/Jellica/AoP/Jel.gif>
