<strong>AUTOFIRE UTILITY</strong>:<br>
- Information and support can be found at <a href="http://pub150.ezboard.com/feqhunterfrm10">EQ Hunter</a><br>
- Program author is Moos Sherwood, of the Prexus Server<br>
<br>
<strong>Installation</strong>:<br>
- <a href="http://www.eqhunter.com/Page.asp?NavID=112" target="_blank">Download</a> the zip file and extract to your Everquest Directory<br>
- You may want to make a shortcut to your desktop for easy access.<br>
<br>
<strong>CAUTION!!!</strong><br>
- Once autofire is enguaged, it will not stop once your target is dead<br>
- You must manually turn your bow off but hitting your assigned hotkey again.<br>
<br>
<strong>UPDATE Tuesday, January 27, 2004</strong><br>
- Edited the Input and Output entries so you are able to chat while autofire is working.<br>
<br>
These instructions are how I personally got this program to work, your individual tastes may vary..<br>
<br>
1, Run program.. setting the Input to F12, and Output to F7<br>

<br>
2, Run Everquest.<br>
3, Set your Ranged Slot as Hotkey number 1<br>

<br>
4, Open your Options Window and click the tab for Keyboard, and choose Macros<br>

<br>
5, Set macro for Hotbutton1 as number F12 with an alternate of F7.<br><br>
6, Set macro for "Target Nearest PC" to *anything but F7*<br>

<br>
You can now hit F7 for a single shot, or F12 for autofire.<br>
You MUST hit F12 again to turn it off.<br>
<br>
Adjust your Update Delta to syncronize your bow attack to reduce <br>
spam of Melee Warnings (too high/low, too far, too close, etc..) <br>
but remember, if you choose number too high, haste may throw off your timing.
