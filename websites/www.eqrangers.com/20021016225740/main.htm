<b>Skill Levels Corrected</b><br>
<br>
Updated some of the Skill Levels to reflect the combat skill update, which took place earlier this year.  I'm sorry for the delay in this, but the official eqguides still reflect the old levels.<br>
<br>
If you see any corrections which need to be made, please contact me at <a href="mailto:pathfinder@theholystorm.org">pathfinder@theholystorm.org</a> with the information.. and please have the information that I need to update.. just sending me emails saying "Update your skill levels" doesnt help me if I don't know what to you're specifically talking about.<br>

<b>Fletching Update</b> (part 3)<br>
<br>
Tonight I added "Darts" to the Fletching Kit... although they're impractical for Rangers, where our throwing skill isnt the greatest.. Monks and Rogues should find them useful - and they're fletched, so I suppose they belong on this site.. hehe<br>

<b>New Feature for EqRangers.Com</b><br>
<br>
EQRangers.Com has been proud to provide this site free of charge and with no annoying banners for over a year.  Now, a new feature of this site will be advertisement of a difference sort...<br>
<br>
Starting Next Month, I will be accepting applications to advertise YOUR skills.. that's right.. the <a href="gmhall.htm">Grandmaster Fletchers of Norrath</a> will have an oportunity to show us there stuff.<br>
<br>
Ads will be Text Only.. listing your name, email address, fletching skill level, and Server name so people can contact you ingame or offline..  Grandmaster's ONLY may be listed.. that's a skill level of 200 or Higher.  Those rare 250 Fletchers will be signified by an arrow after their name.<br>
<br>
I'd like to take a moment to make special mention of <b><a href="mailto:KaylaunaVixxen@msn.com">Kaylauna Vixxen</a></b> of the Erolissi-Marr server for her efforts and dedication to the art of Fletching, she is currently taking orders for Blessed Faydark Thunderbolts.. now, these bows are very difficult to make and time consuming, so there may be a wait for a result.  I personally applaud her devotion - well done !!<br>

<b>Site Update</b><br>
<br>
OK, it seems that all the Everquest Item Database sites are cracking down on people linking through their sites, and my Weapons & Armor links stopped working...  I have replaced them with new information, please feel free to take a look.<br>
<br>
I also installed a Counter on the site for the first time.. and wow.. I should have done this a long time ago.  As of this post, there has been 250 hits on this site, and that's 23 hours after installing it.<br>
<br>
I'd like to thank everyone for your emails and input, I get quite a few each week.  I'm glad I can be of service to your Ranger needs.. and if you know of a new Ranger in Norrath, Please give them the website address, we'd love to have them stop for a visit.<br>

<b>Jaggedpine Forest is here!!</b><br>
<br>
That's right, you half-elf Rangers (and druids) of Karana.. you now have a place to call yourown!!<br>
<br>
Jaggedpine Forest is entered by clicking a gem inside the bear caves of Surefall Glade.. once there, characters levels 35 and Up will be entertained by a variety of mobs to hunt.. most notably, the Darkpaw Gnolls (level 48-50?).. Griffons (45+, can be feared), Willowisps (35+, always drop GLS), Wolves*, Bears*, Treants*, Cougars*.. heck, it's like the Karana's on steriods!!<br>
<br>
I would recommend that you visit Allakahzam's site and view some of the items dropped, quested for, etc.. there are some new Ranger/Druid (karana only!!) items available.<br>
<br>
Good luck and Good Hunting!!
<br>
<br>
* killing these mobs will lower your faction with the residence of Jaggedpine Forest

<b>Website Update</b><br>
<br>
Most obviously, I have updated the look of the website.. if you are sill bringing up parts of the previous design, you may want to clear your browsers "cache" and reload the page.<br>
<br>
There are now links on every major document, where you are click to get a "printable" version of that page.. that should help with your offline referrances.<br>
<br>
Today is a patch day.. (which is why I had alot of time on my hands to think about redesigning the site)  and according to the patch message, they have enchanced alot of the Smithing recipies.. the servers have not come up at the time of this post.. so, I will try the Mithril Arrows when I get home from work, and report if the ongoing bug has been fixed.<br>
