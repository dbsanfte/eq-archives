				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">The bruised and beaten boy wandered through the forest, away from the orcs that pursued him, only hours before they had slaughtered his parents and his big brother. They had died giving him time to flee. His long dark hair fell matted to his face with dirt and blood. And a gash in his side made breathing a torrent of pain. The boy thought it ironic that the heart beating in his chest would be the cause of his death, the more it worked, the more blood that poured from his side. 
<br />
	He could hear the orcs in the distance, howling whenever they caught his scent, and snarling in rage whenever they lost it. He began to run harder, his leg muscles aching from the extortions and lack of blood. He ran to a large hollowed tree and dove inside. He knew if he kept quiet enough there might be a chance of them passing him by. He waited, hoping to die in peace rather than to the cold slashes of blades. The orcs came out of a clearing in front of him. Looking around dumb founded. They began to move on when one orc cried out in victory pointing to a trail of blood leading up to his hiding place. They followed it with there eyes until they rested upon his bloodied face, eyes clenched and praying hard to be unseen. They howled again, crushing his hopes and began rushing head on towards him. He thought it over until a shadow sprang from a tree, landing in front of him. The orcs tried to slow down but to slowly, knowing they were no matches for the seasoned ranger that stood before them. He swung to blades out at the first two that met him, and ducked under an awkward swing from a club that a third one made at him, he swung his sword up into the bottom of the orcs’ chin, blood spraying his face red. 
<br />
The other two began to run but the ranger began to murmur an incantation and roots sprang from the ground, twisting around there feet. From there he only took 2 arrows out of a quiver on his back, and notched them on the bow that had hung across his chest. He released one; it flew into the orcs back, the other also in the same place of the other orc.
<br />
	He wiped his blades off on the grass and turned around to face the boy. By now he had lossed a considerable amount of blood and he lay on the brink of unconsciousness. The last thing the boy remembered was being picked up and carried off into the shadows of the trees.
<br />
	When he awoke he found his self lying on a straw bed in a warm room. He ached all over but he thought if he wanted too he could move. He looked around and saw a fire burning in a hearth on the far end of the room. He also noticed an enticing aroma dancing around his nose. He sat up and noticed an old man staring at him, two gray eyes looking him up and down, oddly enough he didn’t feel in danger around him. 
<br />
	“Your up,” the gnarled voice said, a grin spreading on the bearded and wrinkled face, showing only a couple of teeth. “For awhile I was worried, you were either hallucinating of unconscious for the past few days. It seems they put a simple snake venom poison on their weapons. What be your name lad?”
<br />
	“Nazurah,” he whispered, not meaning to be rude but he couldn’t help but stare at the man. 
<br />
	“And tell me, how did a boy like ye self get a party of orcs after ye?”
<br />
	Nazurah recounted the tell, unable to restrain the tears that came when he told of his families demise. The tears continued to fall unchecked and he turned blushing ashamed of himself. When he looked back at the old man in front of him, he seemed to be looking upon him with pity, and was lost in thought. When he finally came back to himself he began to speak again.
<br />
	“My friend, there’s no need to be ashamed of crying, as long as it doesn’t turn into self pity. Have you began to study a class yet lad?”
<br />
	“No, now I don’t know if I ever will, who would want to take an orphan as an apprentice?” he replied angrily.
<br />
	“My years are almost numbered, tis’ the curse of the human race, too live a life so short. You can stay with me, I will teach you the ways of the ranger. You are perfect for the life it requires, a life of solitude and loneliness…It does get tiresome, even I’ve longed for a companion.”
<br />
	“A ranger…” he said awed, he had only seen a few in his life, and he had always felt a bond with them. But his parents chided him, it was his family bloodline to become wizards, he had held no interest in that life, and had dreaded the day when his training would begin.
<br />
	“For starters I want u too call me Pylon and to have this…” he stated and took an old bow hanging above the fireplace and handed it to him. “This is what our life circles around, this will be you only friend.”
<br />

<br />
	Five seasons had passed and Nazurah, now a young man at 14 seasons was nearly an expert with the bow, and could wield two swords efficiently. He woke up happily, since that dark day years ago he had come to find a happiness he had never had before. 
<br />
	“Nazurah come here son,” The old ranger said.
<br />
Nazurah dutifully went to his side and stood awaiting whatever Pylon thought best to bestow upon him.
<br />
	“Do you like the life of a ranger?”
<br />
	“Yes of course,”
<br />
	“I want you to take you bow and swords, and that pack over there. You will leave for seven days, you will forage you own food and fletch you own arrows.” He stated in a matter of fact way.
<br />
	“7 days! There are orcs out there. What if I starve?”
<br />
	“If you cannot survive this novice training, then you are no son of mine, and you were never ranger material. Leave now, don’t return, no matter what the situation is. I will wait here for you.”
<br />
	Nazurah obeyed and proudly grabbed his sword belt and bow; he picked up his pack and angrily stepped into the woods. Even though he knew this separation wasn’t permanent, Pylon was the only friend he had had since he was but 9 seasons and it pained him to leave. He walked for an hour or so, not sure what to do. He was positive he wouldn’t starve; it was the orcs that worried him. He could slay an orc, but what if he ran into a party of them. And he couldn’t return no matter the situation, to do so would shame his tutor.  Eventually the sound of the woods lulled him into a trance, he made his pace to the tune of the forest only a true ranger could hear. He decided he needed arrows, he took down a small branch and began to whittle it into shaft sharpening the end, this was a laborious task but he enjoyed carving. It was kind of like choosing the fate of the object he held in his hand. As Pylon had done him, if he chose wrong the hours put into it were wasted, if he chose right, like Pylon, there was a future. 
<br />
	When he had made a dozen  or so he started a fire, and burnt the pointed tips to harden them. When this was done he continued on his way, he was so caught up in the beauty of the scenery that he hadn’t realized it was close to night, or the stone opening in the side of a great heal. Nazurah looked around him stunned, there were huge beautiful hills all around him. With the occasional brown bear or gray wolf wandering by, he couldn’t help but stare at the animals. He felt safe with them, and like wise. He continued to stare at the tunnel leading into the hill, he felt it drawing him in…he knew there was no danger here. He stepped inside and began to walk along the winding corridors, his elven eyes adjusting to the darkness quickly.  
<br />
	After a few moments of walking he came to an opening. About thirty yards in front of him stood a building surrounded kind of by a moat. And to his right there were several targets and boys and men of all ages took turns shooting at it laughing heartily at the occasional bad judgement. 
<br />
		“What be ye name boy? Have you come for the ranger games, hurry you’re late.” He turned around and saw that the source of the voice came from a tall human who delivered a hearty slap to his back.
<br />
		Nazurah walked dumbly too the crowd of people, he saw boys and girls his age with bows hanging across there chest drinking heartily of deep mugs of ale. He looked around and saw the source of the attention. There stood a tall Elf boasting of his skill with the bow, and there came good natured criticism of slightly jealous rangers.
<br />
		“Look at ye all! Compared to me your nothing but a bunch warriors with a loose hunting bow!” He stopped and took a deep swig from his mug. “Does anyone dare challenger me to archery competition?” The ale gleamed in his eyes and filled him with pride.
<br />
		Nazurah knew he was good with the bow, he had even surpassed Pylon In his short years in the wooden cabin. An unusual feeling began to take hold in his chest, the anticipation of competition.  
<br />
		“Hold ye tongue you barbarian.” Nazurah found himself saying this with out thinking, he was caught up in the good mood of his surroundings. “I’ll challenge you, or are you to scared to take a fair beating from a boy like me, eh?”
<br />
		The tall elf began to laugh, “You have your self a match!” He dropped his mug and picked up his bow, and grabbed an arrow, he aimed for a second squinting one eye, the he let his arrow fly nearly into the dead center of the target some 50 yards off. “Beat that boy,”
<br />
		Nazurah unstrapped his bow from his chest and took one of the makeshift arrows he had made. Pylon had taught him never too use his eyes to aim, but to let his body judge, and not think about the out come. He notched the arrow into the string and without thinking let his arms move by them selves to line up with the target. He let go and the arrow streaked into the red dot that was the center a few inches to the left of the elves.
<br />
		Cheers and applauds arose from the crowd, and Nazurah felt another feeling, something like elation. For the first time in his life he experience pride.</span><span class="gentblsmall"></span></td>
