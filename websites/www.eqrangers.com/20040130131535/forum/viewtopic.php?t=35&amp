<br />
By: Tekk Trailblazin, Xegony 
<br />
 
<br />
 Sundown had it's way with the land, as it does every evening at dusk. The last remnants of the sun's light shimmering furtively off his aged brown eyes. The world of Norrath had changed much in his time, and he was sure it was yet unfinished. Times changed, and Tekk struggled to keep up. He would admit to none save one, that he may have lost a step, and he didn't see that one person coming across his path anytime soon. Offering up a smile in the growing darkness for days long passed and memories old enough to turn parchment yellow, he scanned the horizon for signs of recent life. His eyes saw none and his half-elven ears had yet to betray him, thus he knew it was true. He was still alone. Looking after the waning rays of light that were disappearing behind a distant hill, he waved his hand by his face in an attempt to push away memories as thick as they come. 
<br />
 
<br />
 Resting on one knee, the ranger slipped between a memory and a dream; unwillingly pulled back to better times and away from his state of alertness. This time, like always, the sun was high and the salt air blew cold off the ocean to the west. So young his armor still felt heavy. Few were the times he ventured into Qeynos, but Tekk knew enough to do as instructed by Master Sureshot of Surefall Glade. Pushing through a crowd of folks all half injured at the gates to the city, he passed one of the few places in a city he could relate to. Tekk respected the Monks of Qeynos, as it just seemed right. It seemed peaceful. But that, however, was not where his business lay today. He had orders to proceed to the Halls of the Order of Three. Scholars and scribes, were it's members. Well versed in the use of magic and enchantments, and well versed in little else, Tekk thought smugly. Pushing the door open with one gauntleted hand, many eyes went to the crossed scabbards he wore across his back. One pair, however, went to his own eyes and for that moment, he was as lost as a child fresh off his mother's apron-strings. She was elegant and beautiful and... 
<br />
 
<br />
 Snapping aware with an inaudible cuss at himself, for lowering his guard to do reminiscing, he stoked his low and well-hidden fire. A cool gust blew across the plateau,  and he pulled his silvery cloak tightly against himself. True, the cloak was silvery, but it had a way of shimmering and melding with whatever colors nearby. It made for excellent camouflage, but half the time it just distressed people to see a head seemingly floating on invisible shoulders. Such was the way of the Warder, he thought. 
<br />
 
<br />
"Warder indeed, Tunare take me." Tekk said sardonically into the fire. 
<br />
 
<br />
 Watching the fire with glazed-over eyes, the ranger saw the flames flicker this way and that. The ranger heard the snapping of the wood as it slowly became consumed by flame. The ranger could not feel the warmth of the fire, but he was elsewhere now. The burning embers of the flickering flame melted and twisted into the Burning Woods. A place  where the very forest canopy often bursts into flame. A place overrun with Sarnaks and the undead versions of the same. Not far from a Forest Giant settlement, did Tekk select a place to sit for awhile with his wife. Within eyeshot of the Skyfire Mountain range, he snared a Gorilla's feet as it gave chase. Smiling at her, sitting there, amidst a wasteland of sickly forest, as if Queen of all she surveyed. Tekk was no King, but Gwendolen was his Queen, and he would bring a swift execution to any who would speak the contrary, with her approval. Turning to raise his bow and knock another arrow, he saw the forsaken animal burst into a draught of flame. And that flame flickered, and remained, and twisted. 
<br />

<br />
------------
<br />

<br />
It was darker now, the moon Luclin was high in the sky, giving off it's own soft glow for the people of the world to see by. Glancing up at it, he squinted as if looking for something on it's surface. Tekk knew Luclin, that is to say, the areas that were inhabitable or simply even bearable for a short time. He'd been to the Grey and he'd passed through  the Grimling Forest, and then some. Reaching down into a pouch that hung freely from a belt hook, he produced a simple pipe. If a bit worn down and aged, all the better for them both. With shaking hands he fingered the bowl full, as he'd done countless times. Exhaling slowly, he lit the pipe with a short twig from the fire, and his hands began to slow in their shaking, until it stopped completely. He thought he heard her speak, he thought he heard her say that he'd promised he wouldn't. But he did not need to think hard to know it was simply his mind, or the wind, or anything but what he thought it was.    
<br />
 
<br />
 As he knelt there by the fireside, he put his arms around his knee and pulled it close to his chest. He was not cold, not exactly. Luclin got cold, Velious got cold, few got colder then Permafrost Caverns. A smile spread across his face like wildfire as he recalled their conquest of that place. As he contentedly puffed away on his wooden pipe, the smile faded slowly. By the time it was gone, his mind was on the Barbarian Guardsmen who keep the peace in Everfrost Plains, and Halas. 
<br />
 
<br />
"A fine job," Tekk reflected, "those boys do, resistant f**kers." He said aloud, pipe in teeth. 
<br />
 
<br />
 Glancing away from the fire and down at his belongings he'd put down. His different packs, tinker and hand woven alike, all were a bit more faded then they were when they were new. Reliable, a word he liked. Somehow out of one handmade pack near him he'd produced a deep red crystalline sphere, about the size of a child's fist. The first and only firebeetle eye he'd ever kept. The firebeetle eye was a focus item required for the casting of Flamelick, a particular incantation that Tekk Trailblazin swore by. Only another ranger could appreciate that fact, and the younger ones likely as not.  
<br />
 
<br />
 Frowning down at his pipe and the ash within, he tapped it against a boot to empty it. Tucking it away as he rose slowly to his feet, he scanned the perimeter once more as if to make sure of what he already knew. Sitting down, he removed his quiver of arrows and smiled at it. His name was elegantly stitched in brilliant purple, as if it were his favorite color and not the crafter's. His camp was ready, he would lay down for sleep soon. Tomorrow would be a better day, Tunare send it so. And as if of it's own free will, as it did every night before sleep, his mind recalled the words of Master Sureshot from so long ago. 
<br />
 
<br />
"To be a Ranger, takes skill. To be a good Ranger, takes finesse. To be a Warder, takes selflessness. You see boy, any fool can learn the trade and train as a Ranger. Half those will make something of themselves and become good Rangers. A fraction of those have what it takes to place the life of their charge before their own, until the Mother of All calls them home. Be steadfast lad." 
<br />
 
<br />
 And that is what Tekk Trailblazin, a Half Elf Ranger from Surefall Glade tried to live by. His charge and wife, one and the same, and both were gone now. Yet somehow, one fact kept him going when all others failed to. 
<br />
 
<br />
"My life before your life..." Tekk murmured quietly into the wind. 
<br />
 
<br />
 Then after Tekk extinguished his small fire, and laid down for sleep. After sleep found him, and after the embers grew cold. A faint shadow of a whisper on the wind found him in his sleeping state but did not wake him. And a small smile crept upon the sleeping ranger's lips, that night.</span><span class="gentblsmall"></span></td>

A fraction of those have what it takes to place the life of their charge before their own, until the Mother of All calls them home. Be steadfast lad." </td>	</tr></table><span class="postbody">
