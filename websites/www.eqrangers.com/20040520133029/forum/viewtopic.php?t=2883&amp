<br />

<br />

<br />
	It was dark that night . . . but unlike that night two months ago, there was no threat in the darkness of the evening.  The stars, invisible under the thick forest canopy of my homeland, twinkled like perfect tiny diamonds on a black velvet background.  The salty scent of the sea flooded my nose, and the crisp breeze of a winter night brushed across my skin.  I stood on the bowsprit of the ship Sirensbane, both arms spread out as if in flight.  The seas were calm and the ship sailed smoothly, taking in the wind to glide effortlessly across the broad expanse of the ocean.
<br />
	
<br />
In the two months that had passed since the Dark Elves had invaded the Greater Faydark, much had happened.  There had been scattered skirmishes throughout the forest as the Teir`Dal retreated and my people chased after them.  The surviving Dark Elves for the most part had been sent to Felwithe, the city of the High Elves.  Nothing really had been done about the handful of Dark Elves, but I knew that they were being interrogated.
<br />
	
<br />
The day after the battle, I had found my whole family unharmed.  Although many lives had been lost, very few had been noncombatants, which was amazing considering the cruel nature of our attackers.
<br />
	
<br />
Many meetings had been held between the head guild masters of Kelethin and the ruling families of Felwithe.  There had been very little decisions made more bickering than anything else had occurred.  But they had decided that some people needed to be sent to set up a spy network around some of the Dark Elven cities, and that was why I was currently halfway, nearly two weeks, between the continent of Faydwer and Antonica.  The Sirensbane was sailing to the human city of Freeport, one of the largest cities in all of Norrath.
<br />
	
<br />
I had been one of those chosen to go, along with two dozen other Feir`dal.  The High Elves had also sent a few of their numerous arcane casters to help relay messages between each of the spy groups.  Maesyn had sent me to organize the groups, then I had been given orders to trek across the whole of Antonica, as well as the continent of Odus, the smallest of the three northern landmasses, Faydwer and Antonica were the other two.  It had been several years since the Elves as a whole had turned their eyes to the outside world, and the head guild masters had decided that now was the time to do so again.
<br />
	
<br />
All these thoughts were going through my head when a call in the Common Tongue down on the deck of the ship brought me out of my reverie.
<br />
	
<br />
&#8220;You, girlie, get down from there!&#8221;  I turned around to see a stocky human sailor with a long brown beard and tousled shoulder length hair pointing a finger at me.  His rough clothes had been patched many times, and many of his teeth had chips in them, or were missing all together.  Dirty and bedraggled by Elven standards, he was still semi-clean for a human.
<br />
	
<br />
I chuckled to myself as I skipped back down to the deck.  The sailors of the Sirensbane always called me girl.  To them I appeared no older than sixteen or seventeen summers, but I was in fact nearing my seventy-first.  &#8220;My apologies, sir,&#8221; I said as I landed nimbly on the wooden floor.
<br />
	
<br />
He snorted.  &#8220; &#8216;Ow many times do we gotta tell ye, them as ain&#8217;t sailing the ship are to be below decks at night.  Get yerself to yer cabin,&#8221; he said with a growl.
<br />
	
<br />
Nodding, I made my way below decks.  Of the thirty-one Elves sent from Faydwer to Antonica, I was one of the few that had my own small room.  I was glad that I was the odd number among the Elves, because I did not enjoy sharing a room with anyone, not even when I was little had I liked sharing a room with my older sister whom I adored.  Too awake to think of sleeping, I turned up the lamp in the room and once again went over the maps of the lands that I would soon be traveling.
<br />

<br />
	The next two weeks passed by uneventful as the Sirensbane made its way to Freeport.  Each night I went through the same routine of being up top on the bowsprit, and eventually, the sailors grew tired of scolding me and left me alone.  After arriving in Freeport, I had assigned groups of Wood Elves and Koada`Dal to certain areas around the city, the base of the operation had been set in the outskirts of Nektulos forest, the dank forest surrounding the entrance to the city of Neriak, the Dark Elven capitol.  Deciding to accompany a handful of the units to their posts, I was able to learn more about the scouts that leaders of my people had sent.  Some were friendly, others quiet, moody, or even downright silly, but all knew their assigned roles, and I was confident that they would do their jobs well.
<br />
	
<br />
Eventually, I struck off on my own.  My brethren would cover most of the eastern half of Antonica, so I decided to head out west towards the largest human city, Qeynos.  Three months came and went, as I made the journey to High Hold Keep, a mostly human fortress in the Eastern Mountains, then through the Karanas.  I never stopped long in any city or village, whenever I passed through the gates surrounding the city, the guards would follow me with their eyes, an apprehensive look on their faces.  The only thing I needed in cities anyway was to find a bard that was willing to journey to Kelethin to take news of my journeys to Maesyn, and then I would leave.
<br />
	
<br />
In this way I gradually made my way to Jaggedpine Forest.  The trees here were different than at home, aspen and gigantic redwoods, with a spattering of majestic oaks.  The Greater Faydark was comprised mostly of tall and graceful pines, the largest on the face of Norrath, with scattered spruce throughout.  Jaggedpine Forest was different from my home, but it was still just as beautiful in its own way.
<br />

<br />
Decaying leaves littered the ground, and here and there was a patch of snow that had slipped through the branches of the trees.  Most of the creatures of the forest were tucked away in dens for the winter, but every once in a while, a bird would whistle sleepily, or a deer would cross my path.  I tread silently beneath the tree branches, not even the watchful owl aware of my passing.  The air was crisp, but not too cold.  Even so, I was surprised when I heard a noise ahead.  It was not an animal or bird noise . . . someone was nearby.
<br />

<br />
Slipping silently towards the source of the noise, my ears pricked to hear any other sounds, I loosened my swords in their sheaths.  I peeked over the branch of a small bush and took in the scene.
<br />

<br />
A blond High Elf in turquoise robes was sitting on a tree stump.  Looming over her was an Ogre with a giant, two-handed jagged blade strapped on his back.  He was grinning and his hand was moving towards his sword.  I could not see her face, but she was shaking.
<br />

<br />
Drawing my blades, I leaped out from behind the bush and charged for the Ogre.  &#8220;Run!&#8221; I screamed at the High Elf as I hurtled past.  Surprised by the fact that the Ogre did not draw his blade, still I kept running.  Nimbly, at least for an Ogre, he sidestepped me, but I quickly whirled around and slashed at him.  Slipping on a patch of snow, I swung too high, and he was able to duck under it then counter with a backhand that nearly sent me across the whole clearing.  I stumbled back to my feet, shaken, and was making ready to charge back in, when the High Elf stepped in front of me.  Her pale blond hair glimmered in the weak sunlight, and her storm gray eyes sparkled and snapped with anger.  That&#8217;s when I realized my mistake.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I-I didn&#8217;t . . . Umm,&#8221; I stammered my face practically on fire.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;What was that for?!&#8221;  She screeched at the top of her lungs.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I thought . . . I thought he was going to attack you,&#8221; I said, casting a puzzled look to the Ogre as he lumbered over.  His brownish orange eyes held an intelligent gleam that I had never seen from his kind.  Then again, I thought to myself, I&#8217;ve met very few Ogres, and they had all died moments later.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Raivenstar had no intentions of hurting me, you dolt,&#8221; the High Elf said, glaring down at me.  She was only a few inches taller then my five foot three, but she somehow took every inch and turned it into a foot.  &#8220;He was going to give me his cloak so that I would not be cold.&#8221;  She jabbed a finger at the fur-lined cloak in the massive hand of the Ogre.
<br />

<br />
Groaning, I slid my swords back into their sheaths.  &#8220;I am so sorry, it&#8217;s just that . . . &#8220; and I waved a hand at the Ogre, who dwarfed the High Elf in comparison.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Me understand,&#8221; Raivenstar, the Ogre said.  His voice was thick and guttural, but surprisingly, I could understand perfectly every word.  &#8220;You are not the first to t&#8217;ink that Raivenstar wants to hurt Alliah.  But Raivenstar is not like other Ogres, he is good.&#8221;  Then Raivenstar wrapped the cloak over Alliah&#8217;s shoulders, and she beamed a smile up at him.
<br />

<br />
Scratching my head, my mind puzzled over how such an odd couple had come about.  I kept my thoughts to myself though, thinking it wise not to anger them further.  Instead, I asked, &#8220;Has anyone else attacked you in these woods?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Nuh uh,&#8221; Raivenstar said, shaking his massive shaved head.  &#8220;Me and Alliah been here two maybe t&#8217;ree days, we seen nobody.  But,&#8221; he added, and now it was his turn to blush, &#8220;we is lost.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Alliah patted his arm and pulled the cloak tighter around her shoulders.  &#8220;We are almost out of food, and, well, neither of us is well suited for the hunt.  If you could guide us through here, perhaps we could forgive your oversight.&#8221;  Her words were proud, but I could see in her eyes the faintest hint of desperation.  And by the size of the packs on their backs, they really were almost out of food.
<br />

<br />
Bowing, I also took off my cloak and held it out to Alliah.  She seemed about to refuse, but I shook my head.  &#8220;You need it more than I, and you have my promise, I will get you through these woods.  But watch your back,&#8221; I said, looking to the Ogre.  &#8220;I know I will not be the only one to take exception to your presence in this sacred forest.  Now follow me,&#8221; and without waiting for an answer, I slipped off into the woods and they followed behind.
<br />

<br />
Nearly a week had passed when we reached the end of the forest.  Somehow, I had been able to keep the pair following me undetected, but now came the real test.  I knew there was no way Raivenstar could get through Surefall Glade without being harassed by the sacred Glade&#8217;s inhabitants.  Within the boundaries of Jaggedpine, only the occasional ranger or druid roamed.  But Surefall was another matter.  Druids, rangers, and anyone who worshipped the gods of nature considered the Glade to be the most holy place on Antonica.  Ogres, with their stereotypical lust for destroying all things natural, would not be tolerated there.  Raivenstar, although gentle for the normally brutish race, was no lover of nature himself.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I do not know how this is going to work,&#8221; I confessed to Alliah.  The day was surprisingly mild for winter, and even the fragile High Elf had let Raivenstar&#8217;s cloak fall loose about her shoulders.  In front of us was the entrance to a cave complex that eventually led into the Glade.  &#8220;If you have any ideas . . . I suggest you speak them now.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Alliah tapped her chin, deep in thought.  &#8220;I think I might have a spell . . . hmm.&#8221;  She pulled a massive spell book out of a pocket in her robes and began flipping through the pages.
<br />

<br />
I stared at it in shock.  &#8220;How did you fit that thing in there?&#8221; I muttered, not really expecting an answer.
<br />

<br />
Barely taking a second to look away from her book, she mumbled something that sounded like, &#8220;A minor enchantment, any first year student could learn it . . .&#8221; then her nose seemed to disappear inside the book.  Rolling my eyes, I wandered over to sit by Raivenstar, sharing a look with him that clearly showed our confusion in the ways of the arcane.   We grinned at one another and waited for the High Elf to find the solution to our problem.
<br />

<br />
After a few minutes, Alliah started muttering to herself.  &#8220;The spell will only affect me . . . but maybe . . . change this . . . and this . . . and, yes . . . that&#8217;s it, I&#8217;ve got it!&#8221;  She jumped up, her robes swirling around her as she rushed over to us.  &#8220;If I modify this spell,&#8221; and then some undecipherable murmuring, &#8220;Raivenstar can appear to be something he is not.  But, it is risky,&#8221; said Alliah, her eyes focusing on us fully for the first time in minutes.  &#8220;We must be in contact at all times, if we get separated, the spell will fall apart, and he will be revealed for what he truly is.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;What&#8217;s it?&#8221; Raivenstar asked looking more than just a little puzzled.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s a minor illusion spell.  I modified it from its original version so that it will work on someone other than the caster. You see, I . . .&#8221; and then she seemed to realize that she was talking to two people that had no clue what she was talking about.  Sighing, she grumbled, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get to work,&#8221;
<br />
Five minutes later, the blond Koada`Dal followed me into the caves leading a big boned black horse carrying our packs.  It was a tight squeeze through the low roofed corridors, and several times we took a wrong turn right into a sleeping bear&#8217;s den, but eventually, we made it out.
<br />

<br />
As we exited the caves beneath a roaring waterfall, my eyes nearly popped out of my head.  I had grown up hearing stories about the beauty of the Glade, but those stories could not compare to the reality.  The waterfall cascaded into a sparkling blue lake filled with fish.  In the middle of the lake was a great wooden building with a bridge leading out to it.  Redwoods, even larger than those in Jaggedpine Forest, were thrown about the Glade, looking as if some huge hand had thrown a bunch of dice that had sprouted into these magnificent trees.  Off to the left, I could see the largest tree in Surefall, and I knew this to be the Great Redwood, the druid guild house.  Te`Anara, the head druidess of Antonica, lived within that mighty tree.  I was forced to pick my jaw up off the ground when Alliah cleared her throat.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Jellica, I know it is beautiful, but we are in danger here.  Please hurry.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
I was tempted to tell them to find their own way out, but I sighed and nodded.  Figuring I could always return for a second look, I led them towards the exit.  Although I had never been here, this place was nearly as well known to me as my home, so my steps did not falter.  We walked past the archery range of Hager Sureshot, the ranger guild master of the Glade.  Several of his apprentices were out practicing their craft, and I watched with envy as one arrow after another struck home in the center of the target.  I was competent with the bow, but I did not think my skill would ever compare to that of Maesyn or Hager.
<br />

<br />
Amazingly, we made it to the exit without incident.  Several times we had been looked at with a little suspicion, but for some reason, no one confronted us.  As we walked through the last tunnel leading out into Qeynos Hills, I asked my friends where they were going.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; Alliah responded.  &#8220;We are just journeying together, seeing the world.  I suppose next we could travel north, to Everfrost Peaks, and explore that region.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Chuckling, I said, &#8220;You might want to dress a little warmer.  I hear the winters up there are brutal.&#8221;  She smiled and then we fell into silence, contemplating what had happened over the past week.
<br />

<br />
Finally, the end of the passage in sight, Alliah and Raivenstar stopped and turned to look at me.  &#8220;We owe you our lives, Jellica,&#8221; the proud High Elf said, blushing furiously.  &#8220;If you had not mistaken me for a damsel in distress, I am sure Raivenstar and I would have perished out there.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Shaking my head, I replied, &#8220;There is no need to thank me.  I would not have left you out there to freeze.  You, on the other hand,&#8221; I said turning to the Ogre.  With a wink, I patted him on his illusionary nose.  Then all three of us took the last few steps out into the wintry sunshine.
<br />

<br />
I parted ways with my new friends that day, they northwards toward Everfrost Peaks, the icy homeland of the Barbarians, me to the south to Qeynos.  The hilly region bordering the great city was known as Qeynos Hills, many farmers lived there, and although the hills were outside the boundaries of Surefall Glade, the rangers still felt it was their duty to patrol the gently rolling lands.  Many animals claimed the hills as home, and the human inhabitants, farmers and fishermen as well as the guards in the outposts, lived in peace with the animals, an unusual thing for humans.
<br />

<br />
My pace through the hills was leisurely; I was in no hurry to get anywhere.  Barely more than a day out from Surefall Glade, a blinding snowstorm came through.  Luckily, I had smelled it coming, and had taken shelter in a small patch of trees.
<br />

<br />
As I built my fire, I realized I was not the only one who had decided to wait out the storm under cover.  Acting as if nothing was amiss, I continued to pile dry wood and kindling in a small fire pit.  Whatever was in there with me was trying to stay quiet, but failing miserably.  Its breath came in short excited gasps, and I heard the slightest hiss of metal as it padded closer.  Pretending to reach for something to strike a spark into the wood, I dove for my sword belt and pulled my right-hand sword out in a fluid motion as I rolled back to my feet.
<br />

<br />
Whirling around, I almost didn&#8217;t get my sword up in time as I stared in shock at my attacker.  With its dark blue fur, yellow eyes, and sharp pointed teeth, it looked like a cross between a man and a dog, and it wasn&#8217;t nice dog either.
<br />

<br />
This thing was obviously no expert with its sword though, and I easily parried the rusted blade as it struck for my arm.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; I asked, in Elvish and then Common.  The dog thing just barked at me though and tried to punch me, but I ducked its hand, then kicked its blade aside as it poked toward my stomach.  &#8220;I do not want to hurt you,&#8221; I pleaded with it, but it did not respond.  Then it leapt for me, slobber dripping from its jaws, a wild light in its eyes.  Knowing there was nothing else I could do, I ran it through as it flew by, and it howled in pain then fell dead to the ground.
<br />

<br />
Shuddering, I rolled the corpse out of the tree cover, then stumbled back in to light my fire.  &#8220;I tried to communicate,&#8221; I muttered to myself, &#8220;but it didn&#8217;t want to listen.&#8221;  Sighing, I rolled myself up in my cloak and struggled my way to sleep.  
<br />

<br />
Outside, beyond the shelter of the trees, the wind moaned and the snow fell down and covered the blue furred body in a layer of white.
<br />

<br />
The next day, I arrived at the gates of Qeynos.  The great stone walls towered over me, snow glinted on the ground.  The standard of Qeynos, a castle sitting on a green and yellow hill on a turquoise background, fluttered in the gentle breeze.  Two human guards stood by the gates, their armor was well taken care of, and they carried their swords easily on their hips.
<br />

<br />
Walking past them into the city, I could feel the eyes of the hidden guards following me.  But no one stepped forward to question me, so I made my way without bother into Southern Qeynos, and to the bard guild.  Writing a short letter to Maesyn, I paid a few gold pieces to the bard guild master and she promised to send one of her apprentices to Freeport, so that my letter could make its way to Kelethin by ship.  Thanking her, I bowed and exited the building.
<br />

<br />
Wandering about the great human city, I pondered my next move.  I briefly considered exploring further the Qeynos Hills, and perhaps going north to Everfrost and possibly meeting up with Alliah and Raivenstar.  But I decided against that.  Odus was only a short ship ride away, and it would be easy to find passage to Erudin in Qeynos.
<br />

<br />
After deciding that was the best plan, I simply followed my nose to the Qeynos docks.  The smell of the sea, fish, and other less pleasant odors was an easy scent to identify, so I soon found myself at the Qeynos Port Authority.  Counting the coins in my purse, I knew I would have plenty to book passage on a ship to Erudin, so I stepped into the building, ready to start the next part of my journey.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=621011" target="_blank" class="postlink">Jellica Wolfsong</a>

<br />
Here's part 2.2...
<br />

<br />

<br />
	Nine platinum and five gold pieces.  That was the price I had to pay for a room in the Vasty Deep Inn, one of the few in the city of Erudin.  It was robbery, and I thought of looking elsewhere, but I knew that no inn in Erudin would give me a better price, and I was too tired to care.
<br />
	
<br />
Slapping the coins on the counter, I sighed.  There goes half the contents of my coin purse, I thought to myself.  The innkeeper gave me the key to my room, taking care not to touch my hand.  I glared at him as I walked down the hall to my room.  Sticking the key in the lock, I listened as the tumblers turned and the door swung open with the slightest push of my hand.
<br />
	
<br />
As I walked into the room, I kicked the door shut behind me, hard enough for the loud boom to echo like thunder down the marble hallways.  &#8220;Oops,&#8221; I said, and sneered in the direction of the front desk.  I threw my cloak onto the back of the one chair in the room and stripped off my boots, armor, and sword belt.  On the table sat an oil lamp, the flame tiny and flickering.  Turning it up, I picked up a piece of parchment and a quill pen.  I started to write a letter to Maesyn, but stopped with the pen poised over the paper.  The hour was late, I was tired, and my mood was not the best, so I decided to wait until morning to write my letter.
<br />
	
<br />
I extinguished the lamp and let the moonlight spilling in through the window light the room.  The light of Norrath&#8217;s moons, Luclin and Drinal, was much more pleasing to the eye than lamplight.
<br />
	
<br />
My head hit the pillow in the small bed and immediately I fell into my dreams.  Suddenly, I was back on the Golden Maiden, the ship that had brought me to Erudin.  The winds howled and the ship tossed in the choppy sea.  Winter was a dangerous time to put out to sea, but Erud&#8217;s Crossing, the small area of the Abysmal Sea between Antonica and Odus, was usually a calm place.  So the crew of the ship had been taken by surprise when the storm had overcome us two days out from Qeynos.
<br />
	
<br />
Rothgard, the captain, had been forced to ask any of the passengers on the ship with a strong arm to help keep the ship afloat.  Volunteering immediately for the duty, I had no idea what was in store for me.  Hauling on ropes, bailing water out of the ship&#8217;s hold, fishing anyone that was knocked overboard out of the sea, and many other tasks.
<br />

<br />
With a jar, I found myself back in the real world, tangled up in my sheets and sprawled on the floor.  Groaning, I untangled myself and crawled back into bed.  The dreams were too real and my heart was racing.  After several minutes, my breathing eased and I fell back to sleep.
<br />

<br />
During the length of the storm, I saw three men fall overboard.  I mourned their loss with the rest of the crew when the ceremony for the drowned sailors was performed.  The ship limped to a small island, her mainmast broken and many of the billowing white sails had also been ripped from the ship in the fierce winds.  We were on the island three days to repair the ship, everyone helped in some way, including the strange inhabitants of the island.  Their faces swam before my dream eyes.  Feline in shape, they walked upright like Elves, or any other two-legged race.  Their fur ranged from sandy blond to a dark tawny brown, their eyes look just like a cat's, and they adorned themselves with seashells and woven palm fronds.  When first I had spotted them from the deck of the ship, I had thought them to be savage like the gnoll I had discovered in Qeynos Hills.  
<br />

<br />
Even in my dreams, I remembered how I had regretted killing that one, but I had soon discovered that the canine race was no different than the Orcs or goblins that lived in the Butcherblock Mountains near the Greater Faydark.
<br />

<br />
But these feline people were different.  They were called Kerans and were friendly, often helping sailors in trouble upon the seas.  A female Keran named Monala had greeted us and her tribe had offered us a hand in repairing the ship.
<br />

<br />
Quickly becoming fond of the cat-like people, I was saddened when the ship had finally sailed away.  Upon arriving in Erudin, the passengers; merchants, travelers like myself, and Erudites returning home, had stepped onto a white platform that had glided across the waters to stop at the dock.  The Golden Maiden had sailed off then, and suddenly I had felt all alone in the world.
<br />

<br />
The Sentinels, Erudite guards assigned to protecting the city, had interrogated anyone who was not an Erudite.  Why had we come, where were we going, what did we plan to do on our stay here?  Two hours I had stood there, my back stiff and my feet aching.  Finally, the Sentinel questioning me had decided that I was no threat to his city, and had let me walk away from the docks.
<br />

<br />
As I walked into the city, I couldn't help but be impressed.  White and black marble made up most of the buildings, gold filigree and ornate carvings adorned nearly all the walls.  At each intersection of the paths stood a statue, some made of flame and water, others were magical floating glass pyramids or spheres with water cascading down the sides.  Erudites were obsessed with water, and rightfully so.  Their most worshipped god was Prexus, the Ocean Lord.  Living on a small island, your capitol poised on the edge of a cliff, a long drop down to the crashing waves below, it was a good idea to pay homage to the god of the seas.
<br />

<br />
Eventually though, I grew weary of the winding walkways.  Utterly lost and turned around like I had never been in the wilderness, I finally realized how tired I was.  I shuffled on a few more steps, then an Erudite woman stepped onto the path some distance away from me.  
<br />

<br />
Erudites were a strange race indeed.  They were closely related to humans, closer than most of them would like to admit.  Their skin was a dark cocoa color for the most part, though some had lighter skin tones.  They were nearly as fragile as High Elves, but they disdained physical exertion even more than my taller cousins.  Perhaps their most prominent feature though was their foreheads.  Tall and shiny, their heads were large compared to most other races, and it was all because of the massive forehead.  Erudites liked to claim it was because of their superior intellect.  I believed it was because of all the hot air.
<br />

<br />
Hurrying towards the woman I called out to her.  In my dream, when she turned around, her eyes glowed like fire, and when she opened her mouth to ask what I wanted, it seemed to be filled with needle sharp teeth.  Of course that was not how it really had been, but she had been arrogant and rude, and in my dreams, she seemed like an angry demon.
<br />
&#8220;Please, I am weary and lost, I need directions to an inn.&#8221; I begged of her.
<br />

<br />
Her voice seemed to roar as she answered me, &#8220;Follow the port stones, you simpleton!  They will take you to an inn.&#8221;  Then she pointed at a glowing blue stone some ways down the path.  Cackling, she disappeared in a flash of fire.
<br />

<br />
Gasping for breath, I once again awoke from sleep drenched in sweat.  &#8220;I hate this place!  I hope the Erudites and their precious city fall over the cliff.&#8221;  Unable to sleep, I climbed out of bed and went to sit by the window.  A gentle breeze cooled the sweat on my face as I watched the moon and stars travel across the night sky.  After a moment I looked down into the courtyard.  The Erudin city library was there as well as one of those blasted port stones.  I watched as one robed Erudite stepped on it and disappeared.  Teleportation was a risky thing to meddle with, and the Erudites played with it like a child and her doll.  Shaking my head, I looked back up to the stars, letting my mind wander out among them into space.  An hour passed before I came back to myself, and then weariness overcame me.  Stumbling back to bed, I knew that this time my sleep would not be troubled.  I drifted off with a small smile on my face as images of Erudites plunging over a cliff danced through my head.
<br />

<br />
Birdsong awoke me the next morning.  The sweet whistling and chirping brought an immediate smile to my face as I sat up in bed and stretched.  Early morning sunshine streamed in through the window and promising myself today would be a good day, I took a change of clothes and went to get washed.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Erudin has showers,&#8221; I murmured to myself as I walked into the washroom, &#8220;that&#8217;s a plus for this damned city.&#8221;  Fifteen minutes later, I walked out of the inn, surprising myself by casting a smile to the girl at the front desk.  Even more shocking, she smiled back!  Apparently not all Erudites are arrogant pigs, I thought with a chuckle to myself.
<br />

<br />
Walking out into the bright sunshine, I breathed in the scents of the city.  The smell of water and the sea was the most powerful scent, but also there was flowers; lilacs, roses, and many I had never seen.  Perfumes were heavy on the air, as well as incense from the nearby temples.  Then the aroma of baking bread drifted to my nose, and I set off at once in the direction of the bakery.
<br />

<br />
An elderly Erudite woman greeted me as I walked into the delicious smelling shop.  She was friendly so I surprised myself again by staying and chatting for a few minutes.  After buying a sweet roll, she suggested I go and visit the great library.  Bowing, I replied I would, and exited the shop.  I devoured the sweet roll in seconds, it was delicious and it eased the rumbling in my stomach.  As I walked towards the library, my eyes were drawn to the quote written in the gold lettering on the round side of the building.
<br />

<br />
&#8220; . . .For knowledge is the greatest quest of all.&#8221; 
<br />
Wise guy, that Erud, I thought to myself as I tentatively pushed open the great double doors.  Erud was the father of the Erudites as the old stories went, he was the one who had led them away from Qeynos to Odus to build the city of Erudin.
<br />

<br />
The sight when I entered the doors was jaw dropping.
<br />

<br />
To my left was a staircase hugging the circular wall up to the next level.  The banister was carved with intricate details of knights on horses and dragons, swords and other mighty weapons, but that wasn&#8217;t the amazing thing.
<br />

<br />
Thousands of books were piled high on shelves.  Big and little, thick and thin, bound in leather or silk, and many other materials.  On the walls were tapestries of paladins in shining silver armor, some on horseback fighting dragons, others leading foot soldiers into battle, and still others sitting at rest in contemplation.  All about the room were suits of armor and many different types of weapons from lances to great two-handed swords.  Many Erudites walked between the shelves, some pulling down tomes nearly as large as themselves, others admired the gleaming armor.  Across the room, some young paladins were testing out sword techniques both offensive and defensive.  Awed by the sheer size and the content of the room, I walked over to watch for a moment.
<br />

<br />
Despite their slim arms and frail bodies, this group of Erudites knew how to handle a sword.  I was tempted to go back to the inn to get my own blades, but I decided that I wasn&#8217;t really in the mood for swordplay.
<br />

<br />
After a few minutes, I went up to the next level, running my fingers over the carvings on the rail of the staircase.
<br />

<br />
The next story of the great library was devoted to the healing arts.  Books of herb lore and anatomy lined the bookcases.  Paintings of robed Erudites tending to wounded on a battlefield, calling down the wrath of their gods on their enemies, and sitting in prayer adorned the walls.  Just as on the first level, across from the staircase was a section where different herbs and medicines were laid on a table, and images of various body parts floated above the tables.  After looking around for a moment, I continued up.
<br />

<br />
The next two levels were devoted to arcane magics.  Enchanters and magicians found information relating to their way of life here.  Various items were laid on tables for young enchanters to practice on, some practiced illusion making on these things others made inanimate objects stand up and dance across the table.  On the floor devoted to mages, minor circles of power were etched onto the floor where fledgling mages could practice summoning elemental beings to do their bidding.  Here they also practiced summoning things like loaves of bread for out of thin air.
<br />

<br />
When I reached the fifth floor, I realized I couldn&#8217;t climb any farther so I decided to explore this level thoroughly.
<br />
A feeling of great power emanated throughout the room.  The magic was so thick in the air it could almost be tasted.  Walking amongst the towering bookshelves were many Erudites in robes with intricate runes embroidered on then.  Running my hand along the spine of one book, a tingle went through my fingers and up my arm, and I quickly changed my mind about picking it up and looking at the contents.
<br />

<br />
Moving on, I spotted an Erudite leaning over a massive book.  He looked deep in thought and feeling a little mischievous, I wandered over and looked at the book he was studying.
<br />

<br />
Not understanding a word of it, still I stood there looking over his shoulder.  After a few moments, he finally said, &#8220;Yes, what do you want?&#8221;  But when he glanced up at me, he immediately &#8220;hmmphed&#8221; and went back to his book.  When I didn&#8217;t take the hint to go away, the black robed Erudite looked up and glared at me.  &#8220;In case you did not notice, I am busy, go away.&#8221;  Then he slammed the giant tome shut and stalked off.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Wow,&#8221; I said to myself, upset that my day had just gone downhill.  Sighing, I walked down the spiraling staircase and left the library.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;And it started out as such a nice day,&#8221; I said to myself, kicking a small stone ahead of me on the path back to the inn.  So absorbed was I in the tiny, skittering pebble that I bumped into a rock hard something.  Stumbling back a step I looked in amazement at the first non-Erudite I had seen in the city.
<br />

<br />
Standing in front of me was a human of medium height, with dark red hair pulled into a long braid down his back.  He was lean and muscular, and when he turned to look at me in surprise, his eyes were a lovely jade green.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Sorry, I wasn&#8217;t watching where I was going,&#8221; I apologized.
<br />

<br />
He smiled.  &#8220;No worries, Elf, it&#8217;s not uncommon for people to run me over.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
I blushed, and was about to apologize again, but then I saw the small smile on his face and I knew he was joking.  &#8220;It is nice to see someone who is not an Erudite here.  I was starting to feel lonely,&#8221; I said instead.
<br />

<br />
Sticking out his hand, he said with a small bow, &#8220;Well met, Elf, my name is Jigglee, and yours?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Jellica,&#8221; I replied, grasping his wrist firmly.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;So what brings a Wood Elf like you to a city like this?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Already I like this human, I thought to myself as I replied, &#8220;Well, it all started on a dark night about eight months ago . . .&#8221; and so I told him my story, from the Dark Elf invasion to my encounter with the black robed Erudite in the great library that morning.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; Jigglee murmured.  &#8220;Tell me, what exactly did this particular Erudite look like?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Recalling what he looked like from my memory, I said, &#8220;Long, black robes with intricate silver and white runes on the sleeves, hem, and in a line down the front.  He had a dark crimson sash, and I think he was carrying a tall staff topped by a blue crystal with a small white sphere in the middle.  He looked young . . . but there was something odd about his eyes.&#8221;  Shaking my head, I added, &#8220;It is hard to explain really, but his eyes looked older than he was.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Jigglee grinned and snickered,
<br />

<br />
&#8220;What?&#8221; I asked, perplexed.  Apparently this new acquaintance of mine knew something I did not, and I was terribly curious about it.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Follow me,&#8221; he said with a wicked grin.  He started off in the direction of the library, and with a puzzled look at his retreating back, I followed.
<br />

<br />
Climbing up the staircase to the top, I was surprised that most of the people in the library greeted Jigglee like he was an old friend.  When we reached the fifth floor, Jigglee looked around for a moment and when he spotted what he was looking for with an &#8220;Ah ha!&#8221; went after his target and upon seeing it, I groaned.  It was the black robed Erudite with a bad temper.
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Greetings, Banei,&#8221; Jigglee said with an eloquent bow.
<br />
The wizard, otherwise known as Banei, greeted his friend with a smile.  &#8220;I thought the library bored you, Jigg?&#8221;  Then he saw me standing a little behind his human companion.  &#8220;I thought I told you to go away?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Laughing, Jigglee said to him, &#8220;Now, now, Bane, be nice to the Elf.&#8221;  He winked at me.
<br />

<br />
Glaring at Jigglee, I replied to Banei, &#8220;Blame your friend, he&#8217;s the one that brought me here, and I&#8217;m not sure why yet.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;ll find out soon enough,&#8221; Jigglee responded with a sly grin, then he sat in a chair in front of the table the wizard was seated at.  &#8220;Pull up a chair, Jelly.&#8221;
<br />

<br />
Chuckling, I grabbed a chair at another table and brought it over.  &#8220;Do not call me Jelly!  Now what is this all about?&#8221;
<br />

<br />
&#8220;Goodbye, Bane, I hope to cross paths with you again one day.&#8221;  Hitching my pack up higher onto my shoulder, I bowed to the arrogant Erudite who had become one of my closest friends.
<br />
&#8220;Safe travels to you Jellica, enjoy your journeys!&#8221;  Then with a last wave to me, Banei chanted some arcane words to his god, The Burning Prince, Solusek Ro, and with a final motion of his arms, disappeared in a flash of light.
<br />

<br />
Turning away from the fast fading glimmer of light where my friend had been, I headed south.  Dunes of sand rolled endlessly on and on, shimmering in the bright sunlight.  Banei had teleported us by magic to the deserts of eastern Antonica, the Deserts of Ro. 
<br />
Spending the remainder of the winter in Erudin, I had quickly formed a bond with Jigglee and Banei.  But when spring had arrived, I knew it was time to continue with my journey.
<br />

<br />
Looking out across the dunes, I smiled to myself.  Thoughts of my friends, Alliah and Raivenstar, the unlikely pair of Ogre and High Elf, and Jigglee and Banei, the inseparable duo, flitted through my head.  Eager to meet more friends in my journeys, I knew that here in the Deserts of Ro I would find my next adventure.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=621011" target="_blank" class="postlink">Jellica Wolfsong</a>
