<br />
New Friends: 
<br />
The day had been long, much longer than group of
<br />
adventurers had expected. Earlier that day they had
<br />
taken an assignment from the wayfarers camp located in
<br />
the butcherblock mountains. Sounded simple enough,
<br />
collect some sample jars located in the mistmoore
<br />
caverns, piece of cake. These six friends had been on
<br />
many adventures and even a few misadventures over the
<br />
past three or four seasons, they worked well together,
<br />
and were a grand mix of grace, and power. Kelic the
<br />
wizard would often take the leadership roll, or aquese
<br />
to the ranger Jedaar. The entire group was made of
<br />
good leaders, and as such worked very well together,
<br />
each knowing what the other would need or want in any
<br />
given situation. Many people could not understand the
<br />
relationship the group had formed, Kelic being a high
<br />
elf, both Jedaar and his new bride the druid Avia
<br />
being wood elves, would have normally made for some
<br />
internal battles, and fierce competition. Yet the
<br />
group had never experienced it, as each held great
<br />
respect for the other, granted as only true respect
<br />
could be, by the deeds each had witnessed of the
<br />
other. SolSitchca the half elf cleric with her long
<br />
flowing blond hair and petite eleven features, had
<br />
proven her worth many more times then she would admit,
<br />
but the remainder of the group would swear they could
<br />
never repay her. Quite and reserved as she was, even
<br />
many high elves considered her to be aloof, that is
<br />
until they got to know her. Derous was a human, and
<br />
rather large even for that race, at six feet and eight
<br />
inches, and three hundred pounds, give or take a few,
<br />
with nary a stitch of clothes, many a troll and ogre
<br />
cut him a wide berth. His natural strength was great
<br />
and when he hit something, it either fell back, fell
<br />
over, or went flying. Derous was not the quiet one of
<br />
the bunch, that was for sure, his booming voice was
<br />
often heard as he rushed headlong into whatever
<br />
adversary they had, and rarely was he alone. Detaran
<br />
would often be at his side, at only one inch shorter
<br />
the Vah Shir beast lord was himself a force to be
<br />
reckoned with. A magical warder at his side much of
<br />
the time the cat man was faster than many, and as
<br />
fierce as any. Sample jars in hand the group had
<br />
exited the vast and dangerous catacombs with only a
<br />
few short hours before it would be pitch black in the
<br />
lesser faydark forest. They had left at sunrise, some
<br />
eight hours past. As they headed east along the edge
<br />
of the forest and the hill's that separated Mistmoore
<br />
Castle from the forest, they moved slow. Nearly
<br />
depleted of magic, and the energy to make the journey,
<br />
the group decided to take a break at the edge of the
<br />
pass leading to Mistmoore castle, there they could
<br />
meditate at the fallen stones that had become the home
<br />
to the fae drake, a magical race of arm length dragons
<br />
with brilliant wings of a butterfly. The constant
<br />
flapping of soft gossamer wings made meditation all
<br />
the easier. Derous sprang to his feet first as he
<br />
heard the shuffle of feet and a groan. As he turned to
<br />
see a young man, who's fine blue robes were covered in
<br />
the ikky green fluids of a vampire, as well as the red
<br />
fluids of life from himself and by the looks several
<br />
others, collapse nearly at his feet. Before he could
<br />
utter a word, or offer aid, the young man spoke two
<br />
words before passing out 'help friends'. In a firm but
<br />
quite voice Derous spoke "awake my friends, there be
<br />
trouble in Mistmoore" 
<br />

<br />
As the five friends jumped too their feet, magic
<br />
sprang forth, as did blades. Derous stood pointing at
<br />
the body on the ground, SolSitchca took three quick
<br />
strides to the body and white magic sprang from her
<br />
hands and bathed the nearly dead enchanter with
<br />
healing power as granted to her by Tunare the goddess
<br />
of nature. "His wounds are grave, I will need time to
<br />
meditate before I can complete the process, for now he
<br />
will live." Jedaar had quickly looked around and
<br />
checked for tracks or sign the young enchanter had
<br />
been followed, he had not. "Did he say anything?"
<br />
Asked Kelic. Derous with a grim look responded "Aye he
<br />
did, two words only ' help friends' then the poor
<br />
bastard fell down, looks to be vampire blood on his
<br />
robes, as well as gargoyle puss, nasty lil buggers."
<br />
Detaran sighed quietly, because he knew his dear
<br />
friend of more than ten seasons would never pass up a
<br />
request for help, especially if it meant pissing off
<br />
Mayong Mistmoore even more. Detaran asked the only
<br />
question he needed to ask "buffs before we go in? Or
<br />
is everyone good?" As each party member checked the
<br />
status of their protection spells known commonly as
<br />
buff's they called out in turn their needs and Detaran
<br />
as well as SolSitchca began their pre battle casting.
<br />

<br />
Once everyone was set they all looked to their leader
<br />
for directions. "Well what's the plan?" Asked Jedaar.
<br />
Avia sighed "well we don't know the extent of the
<br />
battle or size of the force, Derous find the smallest
<br />
tank if any are left and replace them and send them to
<br />
protect the casters, Jed root and shot the healers
<br />
first, casters second, Sol get the most gravely
<br />
wounded out of the battle and do what you can, but
<br />
don't use too much mana, we may need it, Detaran,
<br />
assist Sol, then help Jed once the wounded are clear,
<br />
Kel, well just nuke anything that smell's bad." A weak
<br />
smile passed her lips as the group nodded and then
<br />
moved through the pass as quickly as they could. 
<br />

<br />
Just as the last turn was rounded the chaos was
<br />
evident, half a dozen wounded lay moaning for help or
<br />
trying to help themselves with bandages, more than a
<br />
dozen corpse's of young vampire initiates, and pledge
<br />
familiars, the grunts of Mayong's small army, the
<br />
battle could be heard clearly now, as they looked down
<br />
the ramparts that lead to the open area below the
<br />
castle they could see three groups, each short by a
<br />
member or two fighting to make their way up the ramp
<br />
to safety. It appeared they would not make it, in
<br />
quick order the group went to work. Derous grabbed a
<br />
young paladin by his armored coif and lifted him off
<br />
his feet, away from the two Ancilles that he had no
<br />
chance against if he continued, and pointed him to the
<br />
group of casters, that were now being dragged to
<br />
safety by SolSitchca, Avia, and Detaran. The young
<br />
paladin couldn't understand why the viscous Anchille's
<br />
were not following him, then he realized they were
<br />
held in place by roots, as he looked back he realized
<br />
many of the adversaries were now snared or rooted in
<br />
place and the very two he was trying to keep from his
<br />
friends had several arrows each protruding from them
<br />
as the ranger on the ledge peppered each in turn
<br />
drawing their attentions from the poor souls they were
<br />
beating on, to himself and the very large warrior who
<br />
had moved him so easily. Detaran had sent his warder
<br />
to intercept a group headed for Jedaar so that he
<br />
could continue to draw the vermin away from the
<br />
younger folks who needed a break to gather and counter
<br />
attack. SolSitchca began to bind wounds as quickly as
<br />
she could, casting lesser healing spells as she went
<br />
to save her magic as she would need it soon to save
<br />
her friends, Avia being a druid could heal as well,
<br />
and did much the same. 
<br />

<br />
Detaran having finished his first task, set about
<br />
helping his friend who now had six foes around him as
<br />
his bow was now away and his blades were flying fast
<br />
and furious, striking his target causing the Wightish
<br />
Anchille to step back, then back again, then it
<br />
crumbled to the ground, dead. The other five continued
<br />
to engage his friend as he arrived, weighing in with
<br />
his hammer, crushing a familiar in a single blow.
<br />
Blood began to flow from Jedaars wounds, as well as
<br />
Derous, and Detaran. SolSitchca had been saving her
<br />
magic, while Avia had been casting lightning spells at
<br />
small groups, switching targets each time to wear them
<br />
down without drawing too much attention to herself,
<br />
although she could melee quite well, it was not her
<br />
job to melee, until called to do so. Kelic had sat at
<br />
the top of the ramp the moment they had entered, eyes
<br />
closed, and not a muscle moved. Three young warriors
<br />
had formed a ring around all the casters now that they
<br />
were all together, along with the paladin and two
<br />
recovering rangers. A beast lord who's warder had
<br />
fallen, wadded in to help Derous, along with a
<br />
barbarian and another ranger who had fared well. The
<br />
four of them had nearly twenty foes remaining, Derous
<br />
had already dispatched five, four others were being
<br />
held off by the group around the casters, Jedaar and
<br />
Detaran now had seven as a few more had found them
<br />
from beyond the small lake. Jedaar and Detaran had
<br />
each slain three Anchille's of various skills,
<br />
Detaran's warder had slain two and was now at his
<br />
masters side protecting him with his life. Jedaar lit
<br />
the nearest foe up with a flaming arrow spell, then
<br />
promptly rooted, fell back a bit, rooted another,
<br />
again fell back, and rooted a third. He was tired, his
<br />
arms ached and he needed a break, yet none seemed to
<br />
come. Things seemed to be turning against them as two
<br />
gargoyles came up from the path leading to the castle,
<br />
Derous knew it was bad, he also knew if they didn't
<br />
finish at least a majority of what they had at hand,
<br />
the gargoyles would tear the younger ones up quite
<br />
fast, he also was tired, and bleeding quite a bit as
<br />
the anchille's, familiar's, and initate's had
<br />
brandished fine steel dagger's, and sword's which they
<br />
were proving they could use with great success. The
<br />
ranger on the right of Derous, closest to Jedaar
<br />
staggered, sensing immanent doom a second vampire
<br />
turned its attentions too him, this one however was
<br />
more than able to finish the job compared to the
<br />
initate he had been fighting. As the glyphed sentry
<br />
turned, it grinned evilly, and confident that its pray
<br />
would become a feast. Weltron was a ranger of nearly
<br />
twenty seasons, he had seen much, faced doom countless
<br />
times, and always managed to escape, as the sentry
<br />
swung he knew this was not one of those times. The
<br />
impact was tremendous as the sentry drove his fist
<br />
into Welton's ribcage, the sound was heard more than a
<br />
dozen paces away, Weltron swung and missed, the pain
<br />
was almost blinding, he then swung with off hand and
<br />
connected, the blow didn't do as much damage as he had
<br />
hoped, the sentry took another shot and missed,
<br />
Weltron could feel the healing magic as he looked over
<br />
his shoulder quickly to see a strikingly beautiful
<br />
druid casting her healing magic, as a nearly as lovely
<br />
half elf cleric did the same, only the cleric was not
<br />
looking his way, but rather to his left, he remembered
<br />
hearing a male voice almost in the back of his head.
<br />
He did as the voice had instructed, he ducked. 
<br />
Jedaar knowing his friends were doing well, but also
<br />
that the new threat was going to make things much,
<br />
much worse had begun expending his magic on root
<br />
spells to hold their adversaries in place so they
<br />
could fall back to a safer spot, as he looked to his
<br />
left his heart jumped to his throat as he watched the
<br />
young ranger buckle from the impact, still swinging
<br />
this ranger was certainly giving it his all against a
<br />
far superior foe. With the last of his group rooted
<br />
Jedaar gave a three part whistle, sheathed his swords,
<br />
and drew his bow, as he pulled back Kelic stood, eyes
<br />
wide open and glowing a bright red, every one on the
<br />
field of battle heard it, some couldn't believe their
<br />
ears, others just simply knew, the words were first
<br />
spoken in elder elvish, then repeated in common, the
<br />
tone was chilling, the sound that followed was worse.
<br />
"I am death, I am a death talker, feel my wrath wicked
<br />
ones" 
<br />

<br />
The arrow was all Weltron could see as he braced for
<br />
the pending impact from his foe, he could hear the
<br />
whistle, then a gurgle, then both foes fell at his
<br />
feet, an arrow planted directly between the eyes, two
<br />
more fell from the blows of the giant of a man next to
<br />
him, the rest were gone in a blinding flash of fire
<br />
and light. Weltron looked to his right to thank his
<br />
fellow ranger only to be knocked over by him as he
<br />
dove straight for him, as he hit the ground on his
<br />
back, the pain from his broken ribs swelled and he
<br />
yelled in pain, opening his eyes as the gargoyle just
<br />
missed his face with its rear claws as it speed toward
<br />
the group of casters. Avia leapt forward past the
<br />
young warriors, they were far too spent to take on
<br />
this last threat, and she was far too low on mana to
<br />
handle it the proper way. The gargoyle struck her at
<br />
full speed, nearly knocking her off her feet, the
<br />
initial blow had been harder than she had expected and
<br />
stunned her for a moment, the second gargoyle had
<br />
landed squarely on Jedaar as the two rangers had tried
<br />
to move out of the way, it paid the price as Detaran
<br />
and Derous both let loose with their hardest blows,
<br />
knocking the beast off and stunning it, Weltron not
<br />
wanting to be left from the fight charged the gargoyle
<br />
that was bothering the lovely lady who's name he was
<br />
determined to find out. As he struck the beast in the
<br />
back his first blow landed but not as hard as he had
<br />
expected, these stony creatures were as tough as they
<br />
had appeared. He struck again and again each blow a
<br />
little harder as he searched for the soft spot,
<br />
striking at just above the waist line the creature
<br />
roared as his blade penetrated a little bit, the beast
<br />
whirled and snarled at him, mucus dripping from its
<br />
stone fangs. In the back of his mind he told himself
<br />
that he had just done another very stupid thing and if
<br />
he lived, he would have to learn to be just a bit less
<br />
foolish. Avia didn't waste a moment, she struck with
<br />
the ferociousness of any warrior, and the skill of a
<br />
master sword wielder, the beast stood upright in mid
<br />
air, a low gurgling roar as it collapsed to the
<br />
ground, void of life. She pulled her sword from the
<br />
body and looked up to see her new husband limping up
<br />
toward her, along with her dear friends Derous, and
<br />
Detaran, along side them were three new friends, and
<br />
directly in front of her was an enamored looking young
<br />
ranger, she smiled her gracious court smile and bowed
<br />
slightly to her new friend. "Thank you brave ranger
<br />
for your valiant assistance with that nasty beast,
<br />
your timing was perfect." He couldn't believe his
<br />
ears, she thought him valiant. 
<br />

<br />
SolSitchca began healing the most gravely wounded as
<br />
the others bandaged those who had begun healing, the
<br />
entire group began to head for the pass out of
<br />
Mistmoore, and into the Lesser Faydark. Felekis a
<br />
wizard made his way back to Kelic and began asking him
<br />
all sorts of questions about his spell, and his gear,
<br />
Nortil one of the warriors, a dwarf with some
<br />
significant damage to his gear was curious as to how
<br />
they managed to stumble by. As the group gathered at
<br />
the top to rest and heal the wounded they explained
<br />
how the enchanter had stumbled out as they were
<br />
resting near the fae drake's. Avia had pulled the two
<br />
clerics, two druids, one wizard, and one enchanter to
<br />
the back, instructing the clerics and druids to
<br />
prepare their heal spells for the work ahead, the
<br />
wizard and enchanter were instructed to simply
<br />
meditate in the event something else happened, each
<br />
did as asked without question. The group that had
<br />
nearly made it out of the pass consisted of two
<br />
warriors Saban and Taban twin brother humans, two
<br />
paladins, Camec'ra another human male from the far
<br />
deserts, and a female half elf Kuhlaran, and a
<br />
Euradite male beast lord named Fodar'mel. Each
<br />
appologized for the trouble they had caused,
<br />
explaining they had traveled down to the area just
<br />
below the castle gate as two groups, when they were
<br />
jumped by several will sappers, and anchilles, then a
<br />
patrol found the battle and joined, the two clerics
<br />
with them had fallen, along with the wizard's, one
<br />
from each group. As they fell back the ranger from
<br />
Fodar'mels group was over run, and a ranger named
<br />
Zedic from the other group insisted the others run
<br />
while he held them off, which he did for a while. The
<br />
enchanter had been able to run out ahead and warn the
<br />
others as he went, then he got attacked at the ramp
<br />
and they lost track of him as they took down the
<br />
familiars and initiates chasing him. As the story
<br />
unfolded the carnage became clear, indeed this had
<br />
been a day of losses, there had in fact been six
<br />
parties of six adventurers at the castle mistmoore, of
<br />
the thirty six that had entered, only twenty seven had
<br />
survived the day, and all were gravely injured and
<br />
would need to spend the night and better part of the
<br />
next day healing and resting before they could travel.
<br />
The nine corpses were gathered, with Jedaar and
<br />
Detaran casting invisibility and heading to the area
<br />
known as the pit to retrieve the rangers, clerics, and
<br />
wizards to bring back to SolSitchca in hopes of
<br />
getting them revived, provided they still had their
<br />
heads, since a body without a head, can not be revived
<br />
from the dead, even by the most powerfull clerics. 
<br />
Weltron had gone out to the lesser faydark and found
<br />
the enchanter and led him back to the safty of the
<br />
larger group. As they returned his heart was nearly
<br />
broken as he saw the lovely druid kissing the ranger
<br />
who must be a master archer to have made the shots he
<br />
had made. Not being a man of lesser character he
<br />
approached the couple, and bowed deeply "I am Weltron,
<br />
son of Samona, and Benron Goldenleaf, this day you
<br />
have each saved me, and yet I do not know your names."
<br />
Weltron had given his parents names, mother first as
<br />
it was wood elf tradition that the husband would take
<br />
the wifes name, as such the wife would speak formaly
<br />
for the family, yet each shared responsibility for all
<br />
family members. Weltron was about to be shocked, yet
<br />
again this day, as were nearly all that had made camp
<br />
here. Avia stood along side her husband and spoke
<br />
proudly and with the dignity of a druid of high
<br />
standing "this is my husband Jedaar, son of Cameous
<br />
and Kirin Dragonsfire, and I am Avia" she paused for a
<br />
moment, to let the fact that she had introduced her
<br />
husband first, as well as listed his father first, the
<br />
look of shock began to grow on Welton's face as she
<br />
continued. "We are Jedaar and Avia Dragonsfire,
<br />
pleased to meet you young Weltron." They both smiled
<br />
and bowed nearly half way, far more than was
<br />
tradition. Weltron began to bow once again as he
<br />
spoke, the shock on his face was as clear as the shock
<br />
in his voice "a most unusual couple, and certainly
<br />
worthy of my pledge." As eveyone looked on Weltron
<br />
went to one knee "I pledge to you this day, that my
<br />
life belongs to the family Dragonsfire, my services
<br />
are but to call upon, your children shall know the
<br />
same debt, as leader of my group you have saved me
<br />
once each and the remaining members of my group once
<br />
each, as such I take pledge for the lives you have
<br />
saved this day." Felekis the high elf wizard, Adline
<br />
the human paladin, Hekash the dwarven warrior, and
<br />
Queldor the human warrior each fell to a knee behind
<br />
their good friend and leader. Adline spoke first and 
<br />
she was echoed by each, "so do I pledge."
<br />

<br />
Both Avia and Jedaar began to protest, but it was too
<br />
late, the pledge had been made, the group also pledged
<br />
their lives to Detaran, Derous, Kelic, and SolSitchca.
<br />
Before they had finished their pledge Nortil had
<br />
rounded up his group and made the same pledge, as did
<br />
Camec'ra and his group, as well as Fodar'mel and his
<br />
group, Severis the high elf enchanter was the only one
<br />
from his group left alive, yet he pledged alone, and
<br />
Dorin the barbarian berzerker was left with his only
<br />
remaining group member Nekkaris the human druid. As
<br />
the large group of thirty three set up a modest camp,
<br />
there was much chatter, and much sharing of family
<br />
names, and locations so that all the others could
<br />
contact them if ever the need did arise. That night
<br />
many friends were made, many futures were set, many of
<br />
them would meet again. Some gods smiled that night,
<br />
others did not. 
<br />

<br />
SolSitchca prepared in silence, for the rejuvination
<br />
of the dead, this was going to take a while, and she
<br />
was already dead tired. Jedaar noticed Weltron's bow,
<br />
it was a fine bow, carved of oak with a hemp string,
<br />
Jedaar reached into his gear and pulled out a Steel
<br />
Shaft Compound bow, it was a magic bow, it was a
<br />
powerful bow. "Young Weltron, I have noticed your bow
<br />
and though a fine bow it is, this may server you
<br />
better, the only thing I ask in return, is that you
<br />
pass it on one day when you have a better replacement,
<br />
pass it on to a ranger who can use it, and who needs
<br />
it." Weltron nodded as he grasped the bow, bowing his
<br />
head. Not a word was spoken about it by either. After
<br />
Jedaar had walked off Kelic walked over calmly and
<br />
spoke quietly to the young ranger, who nodded,
<br />
furrowed his brow, and nodded again. Jedaar noticed
<br />
the conversation, but knowing his friend as well as he
<br />
did, knew it was not his business, unless Kelic made
<br />
it his business.
<br />

<br />
The morning brought nine new friends to the bunch, and
<br />
one very exausted cleric, althought the other two
<br />
clerics had helped, and the two who were rejuvinated
<br />
were the first to be brought back, for the simple
<br />
logic that five clerics were better than three,
<br />
SolSitchca had resurected while the other two had
<br />
healed the risen. The entire group, now forty two
<br />
strong, rested the moring, with several groups and
<br />
lone adventurers stopping by, some to rest in the
<br />
safty of a large group, others simply curious about
<br />
such a large group in the lesser faydark. As it became
<br />
afternoon the entire group packed up, and headed as
<br />
one for the comforts of Kelethin, tree city of the
<br />
wood elves in the Greater Faydark forest, some headed
<br />
for home in Kaladim, and others for Felwithe, a few
<br />
headed to the plane of knowledge to find friends. Each
<br />
happy with the thirty two new friends they had made,
<br />
days worthy of tales, friends worthy of the title.<br />_________________<br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1065044" target="_blank" class="postlink">Solderus Dragonsfire</a>
