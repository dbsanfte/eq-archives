				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Buidhe awoke and stretched in the cool mountain air. A being with sharp senses might have divined the elf's presence had it been standing right on top of him, but at any distance at all, the elven form was invisible in the greenery. This giant prey was not nearly as watchful as many other creatures Buidhe had hunted.
<br />

<br />
Since his arrival in The Rathe the day before he had managed to kill three hill giants with his bow, and they were indeed as rich as he had heard. He had counted out the coins in his purse the night before to find that each of the giants had donated about 30 platinum pieces to his coffers. This was turning out better than he had hoped. 
<br />

<br />
"It won't be long before I can resume my fletching practice, at this rate.", the elf mumbled to himself as he began his stalking. 
<br />

<br />
He had dossed down at the base of a huge hickory tree the night before, hidden in the underbrush, where he could watch the rocky tor across the valley. Giants were again busy in the area, he could see, here one stoking a morning fire, there another carrying huge bales of something across the gravelly hilltop. 
<br />

<br />
Buidhe dug in his bags and produced the last of Sokko's Turepta soup, eating a cold breakfast as he watched the giants stirring to begin their day. His bow would soon find breakfast itself, he mused, and he gathered his arms about him, preparing for his second day if giant hunting. 
<br />

<br />
He slipped out of the brush and slowly walked into the floor of the valley to have a look around. His plan was to find a giant who was off by itself and use a slowing glamour to draw the creature further from its friends and safety. Once sufficient distance was had, Buidhe would again use his bow to peck at the giant; never huge wounds, but each enough to count toward the giant's demise. The tactic had worked well the day before with the elf never feeling a blow, and he intended to continue the course through this new day as well. 
<br />

<br />
"There you are, you big beastie!", Buidhe whispered as he caught sight of a young giant dragging a skid of firewood through the morning mists. He edged closer, checking to see that his blades were ready in case his glamours failed to keep the giant occupied at a distance. 
<br />

<br />
The young giant struggled with a huge load of logs and limbs, dragging it uphill. All was clear. Buidhe crept closer, knocked an arrow, slid into the shadow of a stately elm tree, and loosed his dart. 
<br />

<br />
The arrow flew true, striking the giant high in the shoulder. A cry of pain and rage rang across the valley floor as the giant looked around for the source of its misery. Buidhe was able to loose two more arrows in the giant's confusion before the beast caught sight of him and charged. 
<br />

<br />
"Vobisc elem impedust..", the elf began mumbling while making the arcane shapes with his hands that would send a tangling glamour at the giant. The beast flinched as if struck and began to stagger as magical vines sprung from the ground around its feet and tripped it, slowing it considerably. 
<br />

<br />
Arrows then began to sing in faster cadence as the shadowy elf backed toward the forest, letting loose a barrage of darts at the stumbling giant, who roared its rage at each strike. It struggled toward its attacker, arms outstretched and fingers grasping as it tried to run, but the magical weeds continued to trip and tangle its progress. 
<br />

<br />
Again the elf mumbled an incantation, waving hands in mystical signs at the giant. Again the beast flinched, howling as a magical swarm of insects formed around it and bedeviled it. More darts sang true into the great form as the elf quickly drew and fired arrow after arrow, steadily backing away all the while. 
<br />

<br />
Buidhe caught sight of another giant entering the valley behind his foe, slowly lumbering toward the little battle. If it arrived before he had dispatched his current enemy, he would have a problem. He changed the course of his backing, still firing, to try to lead his prey away from the arriving enemy. If he could draw the young giant into the trees on the southern hillside, perhaps the new threat wouldn't see the fight and try to join it. 
<br />

<br />
Everything seemed to happen at once, then. The tangling glamour left the young giant and it lept forward toward Buidhe, who sent three more arrows in a blur toward the beast. As they hit, all in a clump, in the giant's throat, a great moan escaped the creature and it pitched forward in its final agonies, thrashing on the ground at Buidhe's feet. The arriving giant looked up at the death rattle of its smaller kin, caught sight of Buidhe, and charged. 
<br />

<br />
With his magical energies now low and his remaining arrows uncounted, Buidhe knew that the fat was indeed in the fire now. The incoming enemy raged as it ran past its fallen fellow, cursing and slathering toward the elf in a deadly fury. 
<br />

<br />
Again, Buidhe sent a tangling glamour out to slow the charging brute, then turned to run some distance between himself and certain doom. He heard the giant's scream of rage as the spell took hold, but didn't turn to look until he topped a small hill along the edge of the valley. When he did look, he saw that he had a scant lead, so he sent a volley of arrows at the slowly advancing giant, then turned to run again. 
<br />

<br />
He could hear the clump-clump of the giant's huge feet behind him as he scurried up an incline to find a good firing vantage. He turned and fired again, sending a true dart into the giant's frame, dead center. A critical hit! His dart had found the very middle of the giant's body and done terrible damage. Buidhe's hand went to his quiver for another shot, but his fingers clawed at empty leather. The silky lion-hide quiver was empty! 
<br />

<br />
As the lumbering beast drew closer, Buidhe assessed his possiblities, working to be cool in the center of the storm. The giant wasn't badly hurt yet, and its rage knew no bounds. If it reached Buidhe now, it would tear him limb from limb. The elf stood his ground and began a longer incantation now, hoping to tighten the binding roots around the giant's feet and stop it completely. The giant drew nearer still and then jolted to a stop as the vines completely entrapped it. Buidhe could feel the wind of its clawing hands when it reached and howled at him. 
<br />

<br />
Turning to run, Buidhe pawed into his weapons pack and felt for the flaky leather of the only thing that could save him now. Ancille's Bloody Pouch had been his guildmate Sokko's idea; Sokko knew that Buidhe often depended on his bows for his livelyhood, and had suggested that he search for this magical pouch.. and its unending supply of arrows. The cost had been huge, emptying Buidhe's purse, but he no longer found himself far from a fletching vendor and out of ammunition. 
<br />

<br />
Buidhe found the small bag and drew it out just as he heard the giant behind him break free of its glamour and run pounding toward him again. He turned to see the huge beast bearing down on him in a charge, swinging a glittering two-handed sword and howling for blood. 
<br />

<br />
Another incantation flew from Buidhe's throat and hands as the giant closed the narrow distance. The magical rooting caught the giant just as it reached Buidhe, and it swung its sword as the roots formed around its legs. The blow caught Buidhe high on his turned shoulder and jarred him to his toes; he scampered away from the punishment, hoping the mystical ward would prevent the giant from following. It did. 
<br />

<br />
He ran a few yards, turned and sat to strip open the small pouch, keeping an eye on the struggling giant. It bellowed and clawed at him, unable to progress, in a towering rage. Buidhe placed his fingers on the designs on the pouch and uttered the necessary word. The pouch writhed and glowed and pop! a sheaf of twenty arrows appeared in Buidhe's hand. He slid them into his quiver and began the process again as the giant raged and tried to reach him. 
<br />

<br />
With forty arrows now safely in his quiver, Buidhe jumped up and put some more distance between himself and the giant. He would need the room if the giant broke free and came at him; time to try another rooting glamour and wriggle out of this tight spot. 
<br />

<br />
As he turned to sit , the giant broke free and came at him again. Damn! Another quick incantation, taking care to pronounce the mystical sounds exactly right, and the giant again froze in place, frustration and fury dancing on its face. Buidhe again busied himself with his pouch, making arrows and keeping a close eye on his doom scant feet away. 
<br />

<br />
With his quiver full, he stood and began to fire at the giant again. Shaft after shaft flew from his bow and into the writhing form of the giant, who did naught but rage more and more, bloodlust blooming on its face like a sunset. Shot after shot sang true and time slowed for Buidhe as he drew and fired in the quick cadence that only a Tunarean Ranger could accomplish. 
<br />

<br />
Again, things happened in stacks and all at once. The giant broke free of the rooting magic and lurched toward Buidhe; Buidhe started the incantation again, only to find that he lacked the magical energies to complete it.. and the giant landed a crashing blow with its huge sword, sorely wounding Buidhe and knocking him back. 
<br />

<br />
So.. it was blade for blade, blow for blow and toe to toe. Buidhe was out of options now, and it was stand and deliver time. The giant swung in mighty arcs, its fine steel sword singing as it cut the air. Buidhe quickly unsheathed his bastard sword, parried and delivered a blow of his own, catching the giant high in the neck and doing as well as was being done. 
<br />

<br />
Time seemed to stand still as the two figures battled in the gloaming, ringing sounds of steel against steel and grunts and gasps of battle filled the air. Buidhe had been uninjured when the fight began, but he soon began to feel the damage his huge opponent was wreaking on him. This was going to be a close thing; the giant hit harder than Buidhe could believe, and Buidhe's own attacks were countered often. 
<br />

<br />
The giant landed a numbing blow against Buidhe's left side, sending darts of pain down his arm and slowing his swings. His pale velium bastard sword flashed and the giant took another slamming cut to its shoulder, causing it to stagger back. Buidhe pressed his advantage and called up all his reserves; a flurry of cuts and parries by the elf forced the giant even further back, landing more often now, and the tide of battle turned. 
<br />

<br />
Buidhe sensed that his enemy was now on the defensive, and forged ahead.. swing after swing, more landing now, and blow after blow, drawing blood and crushing bone and.. the giant stood bolt upright, raised its sword and swung for its life. 
<br />

<br />
The huge two-handed sword came crashing in for a final, valiant try; Buidhe parried, sidestepped and thrust in, finding a soft place between the giant's ribs and sending his glowing blade home. The giant gasped, teetered and then floundered back, dropping its sword and finally falling like a lightening-struck oak tree, shaking the ground. Buidhe had prevailed; he flashed a bloody salute at his dead foe. 
<br />

<br />
The gasping elf then kneeled next to the corpse and hid, breathing hard and looking around for more trouble, but the valley was mercifully empty. He ran his hands around the giant's belt until he found its purse, heavy with coin. He liberated the weighty treasure, then stood and walked to where the youngster who had been his first kill lay. As he looted the smaller giant, he came upon another good weapon as well as coins, and a small scroll. Buidhe tucked these things away, scanned the area once again, just to be safe, then hurried back up the valley to the huge hickory tree that had sheltered him through the previous night. 
<br />

<br />
He settled painfully back into his little lair, making those elvish moves that rendered him all but invisible to passing creatures, and began to bandage his wounds. Upon reflection, he decided that the day had gone well, wounds notwithstanding, and the adventure of facing giants unarmed had not unnerved or defeated him. He resolved to find a gift for Sokko befitting the import of his advice to find and buy the little magical pouch; it had truly saved his life this day and his halfling ranger mentor would know it. 
<br />

<br />
The sun was going down as his last slice of Lorelea's Bodacious Bumbleberry Pie completed his arduous day. He settled in for a well-earned rest, listening as lizzardmen snuffled about, hunting for bugs and grubs, but not sensing him in his cozy den. He would be safe this night. 
<br />

<br />
There'd be more hill giants tomorrow, Tunare willing, but tonight it was stars and breezes and birdsongs and Pie. Life was indeed good in Norrath.. for the victors.<br />_________________<br />Pathfinder <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=785910" target="_blank" class="postlink">Buidhe Tuatha</a><br><a href="http://www.propheticalliance.net" target="_blank" class="postlink">Prophetic Alliance</a><br>Firiona Vie Roleplayer</span><span class="gentblsmall"></span></td>
