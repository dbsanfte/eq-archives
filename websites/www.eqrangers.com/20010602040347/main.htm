From the serene beauty of Kelethin, to the deep and dark - haunted woods of Kithicor.. all the way out to Surefall Glades..  Human, Half Elf and Wood Elf Rangers are born of Nature... at peace with the Bears and Wolves of the land.<br><br>
We, the Forestwalkers, are Diverse in Skills.. Quick on our feet.. Silent as we move about.. and Strike without warning.. Somewhere inbetween a Druid, Warrior and Rogue.. We are as Skilled in Magic as we are in Melee - a Perfect combination of the two combat styles..
