				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">Gilfendel slowly filled his water skin with clear cold water from the stream running through the Feerrott Woods.   He had been to this spot many times during this job.  His campsite was nearby, safely hidden away near the pass that formed the entrance to the Rathe Mountains. 
<br />

<br />
He was here at the request of Leaf Falldim.  It was Leaf’s job to reassemble the legendary Kithicor Bow and he had delegated the recovery of the pieces of the bow to one of his most trusted Rangers, Gilfendel Leafdancer.  
<br />

<br />
“We’ve finally had a sighting of our rogue Ranger” Leaf had told him.  “A younger ranger reported having seen Maldyn in the Rathe Mountains area. I was very impressed with the ease with which you recovered the other piece when we discovered that it was in the Guk cave systems, so I have decided to send you after this piece as well.  Be wary though, Maldyn Greenburn is a dangerous adversary.   Now that he has turned his back to our ways, there’s no telling what he might do.  I’ve heard rumors of terrible atrocities committed by my former student. You should leave at first light.”
<br />

<br />
The whistling sound of the club flying through the air at his head, brought Gilfendel back to the present. He instinctively ducked as stars exploded before his eyes. The club had caught him a glancing blow on the back of his head. Fighting to remain conscious, he dropped and rolled to his right as the club hit the ground, shattering a rock and barely missing his head again.  As he rolled, his hand found the hilt of his sword.  It was a basic move that all rangers are taught, but it was the first time he’d ever used it outside of training. You drop and roll, drawing your sword and returning to your feet all in one motion.  As he completed his roll, he stood up, drawing his sword simultaneously, bringing it up and intercepting the club’s downward arc towards his skull. As the two weapons met, he spun to his left, moving even closer to his attacker and kicking backwards at the attacker’s knee.  The attacker momentarily lost his balance and Gilfendel continued his spin, bringing his sword all the way around and slashing the attacker deeply in the side.  Even before he’d withdrawn his sword from the attacker’s flesh, he had begun casting a spell to slow down his would-be assassin.  Instantly, roots sprang from the ground, wrapping around the attacker's feet and legs, holding him immobile. 
<br />

<br />
Gilfendel recognized his attacker, it was an ogre bouncer named Flerb. Instantly, he reached out with his senses, knowing that if Flerb were here, his partner Hurd wouldn’t be far way.  He sensed Hurd nearby and quickly getting closer.  Flerb was flailing at the roots and yelling for help.  Quickly picking up his belongings, Gilfendel called upon the Spirit of the Wolf to lend him speed and set out for the safety of his campsite in the pass to the Rathe Mountains.  As he disappeared into the trees, he could hear Flerb cursing at Hurd. Apparently he’d been found by his compatriot and was none to happy at the length of time it had taken him to arrive.
<br />

<br />
Safely back at his camp, Gilfendel lay down and closed his eyes.  His head throbbed, but he realized how lucky he’d been.  As he rested, he cast a few helpful spells on himself to speed up his recovery time.  
<br />

<br />
It was then that he noticed something was different.  He concentrated… and it dawned on him what the difference was.  Maldyn was nearby!  He could feel it. 
<br />

<br />
He’d been searching these mountains for more than a month.  He had met and befriended a couple of residents of the mountains, a gnome named Hasten and a monk named Zephyl, however none of them had ever seen any sign of Maldyn at all, yet suddenly, there he was.  Gilfendel’s heart began to race as his adrenalin levels rose.  After all this time, there was no way he would let Maldyn escape. 
<br />

<br />
Grabbing his swords, his bow and a supply of arrows, he set off at top speed to track down his quarry. 
<br />

<br />
After tracking his quarry for nearly an hour, it became clear to Gilfendel where he was ultimately headed… the Hill Giant sector.  He had scouted this area several times in his search for Maldyn and knew the area well. Making a quick decision and thinking that surprise would serve him better, Gilfendel changed course and moved to get between Maldyn and the Hill Giant area.
<br />

<br />
Finding a hiding place near the pass into the area claimed by the Hill Giants, Gilfendel had a clear view down the valley where he knew Maldyn would be.
<br />

<br />
Less than 2 minutes had passed when Gilfendel’s sharp eyes picked up movement at the far end of the valley.  It was Maldyn.  Gilfendel chose the spot carefully where he wished to have his confrontation with the wayward Ranger. Adjusting for the speed at which Maldyn was running, Gilfendel began casting a spell. Roots and weeds suddenly sprang up all around Maldyn, bringing him to a stop.  He glanced around wildly, trying to see who had entrapped him, but Gilfendel had stepped back into cover and although he could clearly see the rogue, was completely invisible himself.  Not seeing any immediate danger, Maldyn began to tear at the roots holding him fast.  As soon as he looked down, Gilfendel cast another spell.  Maldyn began to scream in pain as a swarm of Nifiliks engulfed him, biting and stinging mercilessly. Gilfendel cast again and a swarm of bees and hornets joined the nifiliks.
<br />

<br />
Gilfendel stepped out of his cover into plain view, scarcely 20 paces from Maldyn, who immediately began casting a spell in his direction. Gilfendel was ready however and sent an arrow whistling past Maldyn’s ear, so close that the rogue lost his concentration, causing the spell to fizzle.
<br />

<br />
“Surrender immediately or the next one won’t miss!”
<br />

<br />
Maldyn ignored him and began casting again, but before he could complete his incantation, an arrow embedded itself deeply into his shoulder.  Maldyn screamed in pain.
<br />

<br />
Gilfendel slowly began walking toward Maldyn.  “Surrender or die Greenburn!”
<br />

<br />
“Never!” Maldyn growled, through clenched teeth. 
<br />

<br />
“I’m here for 2 things, and I will not be denied.” Gilfendel said.  “I will have the part of the Kithicor bow that you stole from your former master.  I will also return you to Leaf Falldim… dead or alive.  The choice is yours.”
<br />

<br />
“Here’s my answer.” Maldyn hissed, and he began casting another spell. 
<br />

<br />
Once again, before he could complete the spell, an arrow pierced his flesh, this time biting deeply into Maldyn’s thigh.  The spell fizzled and Maldyn fell to one knee, in obvious pain.  
<br />

<br />
As the roots receded, releasing Maldyn, Gilfendel discarded his bow and slowly drew his swords, standing ready. “Last chance Greenburn, surrender”, he said. 
<br />

<br />
Maldyn drew a ragged breath and stood up, drawing his rapier.  Suddenly, with nearly blinding speed, he lunged, swinging his weapon at Gilfendel's neck.  
<br />

<br />
Lightning erupted from Gilfendel’s sword as it met the rapier, stunning Maldyn and pushing him backward slightly.  It mattered not however, as Gilfendel’s other sword had pierced his heart.  Maldyn fell to the ground, dead.  
<br />

<br />
Gilfendel knelt beside the body, giving a prayer to Tunare in thanks for watching over him.  Then with tears welling up in his eyes, he gave another prayer, this one to Karana, asking that his wayward son be forgiven and welcomed back into the halls of the rangers if not in life, then in the afterlife.  
<br />

<br />
Gilfendel suddenly saw a figure appear above Maldyn, enveloping the body in soft light.  “So be it” said a voice in his head, “there are reasons why this ranger fell to the darkness.  He shall be redeemed and welcomed back by his brother rangers.  Thank you young one, you have done us a service.  May our blessing go with you.”  And with that, both the figure and Maldyn’s body were gone.  
<br />

<br />
The only thing left was a satchel near where the body had been.  Gilfendel picked it up and looked inside, knowing what he would find.  He smiled, slung the pack over his shoulder and headed back to his camp.  It was time to go home.<br />_________________<br /><span style="color: green"><span style="font-weight: bold">Gilfendel Leafdancer</span></span>
