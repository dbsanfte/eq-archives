				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">The army stood on the battlefield, grim faced and determined, their hands gripped around swords, bows, clubs, or whatever suited them best. This was the time and place where the magicians of Norrath had predicted the rip in time and space would take place, where the hordes of demons that thousands of years ago had been imprisoned would break through. Now, over the past decade, magicians and enchanters alike had sensed an unbalance, they felt that the seal would no longer hold. If they failed today, there would never be a chance for humanity again.
<br />
It happened suddenly, a gaping hole appeared where there should have been hills and trees, everybody tensed, knowing that this was a lost cause, that some of these demons possessed powers that even the most prestigious casters and warriors couldn’t dream of.
<br />
	Nazurah gripped his bow, an arrow notched. Even though he had never considered himself apart of society, constantly wandering after his first tutor had died decades ago, he couldn’t die knowing that he had a chance to stop these beasts from hell. That maybe he could help change fate. The first demon appeared, dressed in a black robe, poisonous fangs gleaming in the morning sunlight, his black eyes blinking in the sudden exposure to brightness. Nazurah knew what this was, a Juggernaut. It was fabled that no warrior had ever defeated him in battle those thousands of years ago when he was free. And if those fables were true then one cut from those clawed black hands would kill him in moments.  
<br />
	An unsurpassable cry rose from the warrior next to him, he charged across the field wielding two swords expertly. The juggernaut did the same, only at blinding speed; he ducked under the swords and shoved 3 claws into his side, not mortal for the moment.
<br />
Any warrior skilled in his class would have been able to shrug it off when most couldn’t, exactly as he began too do then stopped gripping his clawed side, sagging to his knees breathing heavily. Nazurah saw him cough ferociously, then he got up seemingly ok, and began to swing swiftly but the beast ducked and parried. After a few moments of this the warrior stopped, and dropped too the ground in rocking convulsions. The Juggernaut let out an earth-shattering roar; at this thousand upon thousands fell from the gap charging. All different, only sharing one thing in common, the revenge that they gnawed inside of them, the urge to kill and torture their imprisoners.
<br />
	The kings and lords of norrath all cried lifting weapons to the sky, calling upon gods for strength and courage then charged fearlessly too meet the numbers that already dwarfed there own. Nazurah did the same letting arrows fly into chests and necks of demons, some of them blinking out of existence, others shrugging them off. But he stopped, there was only one demon that imposed his curiosity, he wanted the juggernaut, although he knew no one would live to tell of the battle it was still something he yearned. He didn’t have too look long, for the robed figure watching the carnage, none dared to do battle with him, and he didn’t seem to care. Nazurah let loose an arrow at him, knowing it wouldn’t find its mark, the demon turned around crushing the acrylia tip, it searched for the attacker, its eyes falling upon the figure dressed in green, wearing the symbol of Tunare on his chest. 
<br />
	He ran the distance on his raptor like legs, reminding Nazurah very much of an iksar with a lot of dragon in its bloodline. Nazurah threw his bow to the ground, knowing that he would never use it again, and drew his swords. He blocked the first clawed strike, the collaboration jarred him to his bones, the immense strength surprised him. He brought his pommel slamming into the beast’s skull and spun around behind him ready to jab, into where he thought an artery should be. Before he could a tail he didn’t know was there came out from underneath the trailing robe, slamming him in his chest. Nazurah hit the ground hard several feet back and the demon jumped, ready to tear his guts out with his feet. Nazurah held up his feet and kicked the demon several more feet back, when it was passing by its tail slammed into his face. Nazurah stood breathing heavily, blood dripping from his nose and mouth. He realized something that he hadn’t before, the demon was bleeding, he saw the black substance trickle down his face from where the pommel of his sword had connected. ‘And if its bleeding, then there must be a heart hidden in there somewhere.’ He thought to himself as he drew up his swords and dove at the demon. At the last moment he shoved his swords into the ground, stopping his momentum and saw 5 gleaming claws flash inches in front of his face leaving the demon exposed in his side, nazurah shoved his sword into it. He relished the sound of metal sliding into flesh. He pulled his sword out, the demon stunned he put all his strength and weight into one slash. He gasped when it missed; he barely saw the demon side step. 
<br />
	The demon and him realized something in those seconds, Nazurah wouldn’t be able to block the blow quick enough, it was over. The demon laughed, well as close as something of his nature could. Nazurah smiled back, grim determination on his bleeding and bruised face. For a while he thought he could win with out dying, but whom was he kidding, he had only been alive for a century, while this beast had been for millennia after millennia, plenty of time to perfect the flaws he had. He saw the gleaming talons heading toward his face, Nazurah dropped his sword and threw up his arm, the talons slashing right through it, but slowing the fatal attack down enough for nazurah to duck under it and shove his sword into the center of his chest. 
<br />
	They fell side by side mortally wounded, staring at each other intently, trying with every will in their being to live to see their opponents’ dead. He could feel the poison running through every vein in his severed arm. It felt like someone had filled them with boiling water, instead of blood. The demon began to breathe faster and faster, his face twisting in agony, and for a second, Nazurah could of sworn on the fate of Norrath that he saw something human in the eyes, something that was once human. The last thing he saw before he went into convulsions and the poison spread was the demon stop breathing all together, and the eyes staring at something he couldn’t see, then they blinked shut, his face relaxing in a peaceful expression, finding peace at last.
<br />

<br />
	The armies of Norrath were defeated inevitably, destroyed only moments after our hero’s death. Only the gods could choose the fate of Norrath, only the remnants of its inhabitants could put fate into action.</span><span class="gentblsmall"></span></td>
