  hiya ps,
<br />

<br />
I'm back from my travel and was able to group with a couple ps's this past sunday. Simbul and Zieke. I had a pretty good time, very friendly peeps.
<br />

<br />
I tried to get in on the pof raid but it was a bit tight for piggy backs so I bowed out to give someone a chance since I do have my pof stone.
<br />

<br />
I wanted to try to raid with you guys again today, but I saw where there's an open raid for bot quest in storm and since I only need a couple pieces and grummus to complete my ep flagging I figured I would be of more use if I got that done.
<br />

<br />
I'm looking forward to seeing more of you guys in the future. If I'm around and you need me please don't hesitate to send me a tell. I'm going to continue working on my short term goals (bot pieces, grummus and dusty soriz pouch) but will make myself available for whatever.
<br />

<br />
thanks
