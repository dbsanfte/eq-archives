  <b>Post subject: </b>A poor decision.....<hr width=95% class="sep"/>
  Who would have thought that after just a month in a guild I'd miss you guys so much?  But the fact is I do.  I made a poor decision by leaving PS, no doubt about it.  I miss the guild chatter and the friends I made.  It isn't quite the same grouping with Fude, Trask, and Deest without being able to hear the other side of the conversation.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I've freed up some time in my schedule and actually got a few things done I wanted to finish.  Nearly done with my epic, camped my iksar mask, tiny cloak of darkest night.....and some other things.  I feel much less stressed about the time schedule raiding requires.  
<br />

<br />
I know I might have disrespected the guild tag of PS.  I'm very sorry.  I was proud to wear the Prime Syndicate under my name and would very much like to do so again.  I tend to be wordy sometimes so I'll wrap it up, but I apologize for my hasty decision to leave and would like to reapply to PS if you'll have me back.  Traskul buddy, got a room for a recruit again?  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
There will be a concern about me leaving again and I can assure you all that I will be there for the long hall.  I've seen both sides of raiding, gone back to normal playing and found I miss the raiding more than I thought I would, but especially the great people in Prime Syndicate!
<br />

<br />
Thanks for considering taking me back.  Sorry it is necessary.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />

  glad to see you've given it some thought again bud.  What can I say.  The first time i grouped with Bardtail was during Agnarr raid when i forget what went wrong but people started dying and kelvas got summoned and pwned =*(.  Anyhow, i lost soe and as soon as that happened bardtail was there to selos my sorry ranger ass so i could resoe myself and kite agnarr.  Kiting is so much more fun with selos =D.  
<br />

IMO i think we could really use a bard who isnt a bot and can pull.  The only problem is hes not ep flagged yet but thats fine, when he is ill help him get to know fire and some of that good stuff myself, and who knows we could save some time on tough pulls with a bard helpin that can fade etc.  Before coming to PS, I had never seen monk-only pulling teams, but that works too.  But a bard or two in the pulling team wouldnt hurt either, if anything it would save us time from having to clear things that we wouldnt have to clear with a bard (ie all the magma giants).  With time saved, we could hit more targets, and get more gear in during a nite with full attendance etc.  I think a bard who is being played by only 1 person and is not a bot could come a long way to helping PS, despite his lack of experience wtih EP, he can definitely learn the stuff and help make a great contribution.  Those are just some of my thoughts ~ Deestroyr

  Grrr...so very indeciscive you are! I knew you would be back, especially after the way you acted directly after you got your guild tag. If I may paraphrase you "Omg...I keep scrolling back just to see my guild tag"! Someone who acts like that dosen't just up and leave. If the leadership sees fit to accept you back, i would be glad to continue sponsoring you. Hope to see you back!
