First in excellence, quality, or value.<BR><STRONG>Syn·di·cate</STRONG> - n. An association of people or firms formed to engage in an enterprise or promote a common interest. </FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>Prime Synicate is made up of a core of serious, experienced players. We came to Stromm to rekindle our joy of the game, experiencing everything that EverQuest has to offer from the ground up. We view Stromm as being the ultimate challenge, getting back to the basics and starting over from scratch. </FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>So many guilds, how is PS different? <BR></STRONG>We are one of the few, if not only higher end raiding guild on the Stromm server that has built itself up from scratch. Meaning that we were not formally another guild on another server that decided to move to Stromm with a set number of members. We are a serious guild who has the experience to succeed and the drive to achive our goals. We have a strong foundation and have already outlasted many other guilds. We like to joke around and have fun, but when it comes to advancement and raiding... we are structured, efficent, and get shit done right. Our leadership is diligent, there is no high and mighty ego that gets tossed around, no screaming, belittling, or cursing at someone if they make a mistake. No corruption, hidden agends, drama or bs. We have an awesome core team and are recruiting quality players to help contribute and be a part of something that will be a lasting experience. If this still sounds good to you, read on... </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>Goals:</STRONG><BR>                            It is NOT our goal to rush through content, become #1 or race to Plane of Time. We desire to see and experience everything, completing every expansion from Kunark, Velious, Luclin, through Planes of Power. If you want to raid a lot, experience a lot of the game's content and be in a guild where you are respected and not just another member of a massive zerg army then Prime Syndicate may very well be the home you seek. </FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>Raid Guests:</STRONG><BR>If you are interested in exploring what PS is like, you are welcome to speak with an officer and request to attend one of our raids as a 'guest'. You do not necessarily need to be unguilded for this. Guest invites are approved or declined by leadership discretion. We ask nothing of our guests except that they follow the direction of the raid leader and participate as a member of the raid in that respect. Note that Guests are not entitled to any loot unless no tagged member or alternate of Prime Syndicate requests it. Note: This does not include flagging events, please see the section regarding flagging.<BR><BR><STRONG>Flagging: <BR></STRONG>Only guild members, member raid bots and recruits are permitted to attend raid events that are flaggings. Only&nbsp;exception is if your guild has made an arrangement with PS leadership to do back flaggings with each other. If you are another guild seeking such an arrangement, have your guild leader contact Duskin.</FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>New Member Recruiting:</STRONG><BR>Prime Syndicate has three phases to our recruiting process that recruits must go through before being granted full membership into the guild. </FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>The reason for this is because we take pride in our guild tag. We want people who want to be a part of what we are trying to accomplish. If you just want to be in a half-ass guild that will tag anyone who walks up and asks for it, that's not us. The recruiting process is designed so that we can learn about you, your skills as a player, and how you can work with others as a team before tagging you as a member.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><U>Applicant:<BR></U>Your application is reviewed by our recruiting officer(s). If your application is up to standard you will be invited to join our recruit channel. This is so that you can get to know our members, and they may get to know you. (If your class is not needed at that time, you might remain as an applicant until a spot opens for you. If this is the case you will be informed prior to being invited to the recruit channel.) At this time a post is made on our recruit discussion forum so we can gather feedback from our members. The applicant phase can take up to two weeks. You should make it a point to participate as much as possible to make this process go more smoothly. Note that applicants are not permitte to withdraw from guild bank, but are permitted to roll on loot if no tagged member wants.</FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><U>Probationary Member:</U> <BR>You will be Guild tagged, observed for skill, conduct, playtime, raid attendance and adherence to guild rules. Durration of the probationary phase is up to four weeks, extendable at the officers discretion. At this time you may roll on loot drops in raids, and withdraw from the guild banks if you 'need'. We ask that you give as you receive, loot whores wont last long with us.</FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><U>Full Membership:</U> <BR>Officers discuss what we have observed during your probationary period. If we believe you to be an asset, you will become a Full Member at this time; If not, you will remain as a probationary member, or asked to leave the guild. </FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>Participation:</STRONG><BR>Members are expected to keep up with the flow of leveling and general advancement of the guild. Members are expected to attend raids if online. At times members may be excused from attending an event (this requires officer approval). No one will ever boot you or frown upon you if you need to go inactive or cannot be online from time to time due to real life issues. </FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>We raid approx. 3-5 days per week. Members will be required to maintain a 60% raid attendance average (exceptions are made if you have a rotating work schedule/vacation/sick/RL/etc.) Raids will be based around Eastern Time Zone. Raiding times will always vary based on targets and force (ie: We will raid anytime a target is up and we have force to take it out). </FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana size=1>The leadership reserves the right to restrict a member from bidding on loot if their raid attendance has fallen to an inactive status (inactivity can be considered anywhere from below 40% raid attendance over 30+ day period). To obtain active status again, a member must reach 40%&nbsp;raid participation status over the last&nbsp;30 days. &nbsp;Failure to maintain an active status can result in your removal from the guild. Members who communicate with an officer that they need to go inactive due to RL issues are excluded.</FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>Faction:</STRONG><BR>PS is on the “kill it if it’s in our way faction”, however, generally we do not do raids on Dain so Coldain faction tends to stay in tact.</FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>LDoN:</STRONG><BR>The LDoN expansion has brought about a lot of changes to Everquest and yes it has had an impact on raiding guilds. We are a raiding guild, we call raids whenever we have a confirmed target and force to take it out. We cannot predict when exactly this will be. If we are not racing for a target, or if it is not a high priority target, we will often give members time to finish their LDoN adventures. We also try to give notice when at all possible to try and be understanding that the dungeon adventures are not always easy to just walk out of. However... let it be clear 'we are a raiding guild' if you consider joining be aware of that. You may be told you need to leave whatever you are doing forthwith and come raid, this will include LDoN groups.</FONT></FONT></P>

Grouping:<BR> </STRONG>                                                                                                            </FONT></FONT><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1>It is YOUR 
responsibility to find or make groups. Many times guild-only groups are not 
possible. Some times there simply is not room for more people in certain areas. 
Don't take these types of things personally. There are tons of options for 
people to get experience, sometimes it's just not the place you might wish. You 
need to take the initiative and form a group if you can't find a group yourself. 
Any 4 people in this guild can kill almost any blue mob in the game. You have to 
take what you can get and grab whoever may be asking for groups at the zone you 
are in. If you are going to limit yourself to guild-only groups with enchanters 
and clerics every time, then you are just going to frustrate yourself.

<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>Loot System:</STRONG><BR>Prime Syndicate uses the DKP bidding system. This system 
rewards members who regularly participate in raids. Points are obtained from 
raiding specific set targets. The difficulty/time of the encounter determines 
how many points are awarded. Points can also be offered to guild members for 
doing certain things that will help the guild progress as a whole (like key 
pieces for example). These special reward DKP points are listed in the member 
forums. At NO TIME are certain people awarded more DKP for certain tasks than 
others. E.g. Player A will not receive 10 DKP for obtaining a VT key while 
player B gets 30 points for the same key.</FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>How bidding works:</STRONG> <BR>First time item drop values are generally set pretty low, then the item is linked in guild chat along with the starting bid value. Members then bid as low or high as they wish based on the total DKP they have saved up and of course what they feel the item is worth. The next time that item drops and goes out for bid, bidding will start at 3/4 the previous bid cost. You will not be allowed to bid using points you do not have. For example, if you only have 6 points saved up and the bid goes beyond that number then you better hope nobody else bids 7 points or you will lose. Also, the highest number that you bid is what you will purchase the item for. E.g. - An item starts at 3 DKP. Player A bids 4 DKP and you bid 20. If nobody else bids, you just bought the item for 20 DKP when you could have bought it for 5 DKP. If you over bid then that is what you pay, so it pays to watch the bids and use 1-point increments.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>Raid participation and activity:</STRONG> <BR>Since activity is an important factor in Prime Syndicate’s success, attendance percentage may also be a factor when bidding or in key part distribution. For example, if you save up 1000 DKP, go away for a while, and then come back a few months later, you might be required to raid actively again for a couple weeks before being permitted to start bidding on items over those who are currently active and attending raids. As stated previously, we are not a guild who boots people or gives them a hard time if they cannot be online due to real life circumstances. Many of us have jobs, school, families etc that can prevent us from being online as much as we'd like. However, people who just vanish and go inactive without any communication with an officer risk being removed from the guild. </FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>Mains &amp; Bots (Alternate Characters):</STRONG><BR>You are required to declare a main. This is who we as a guild say we are willing to help you equip and you as a player are saying that you are willing to use to help the guild. We are not here to equip your alt(s), thus do not expect anything for them. However alts may request to be considered for a piece of loot if no other main should want it. As the guild works to improve your main, you are expected to also work on your main during your online time to help make the guild stronger. Switching mains is discouraged and permission to do so is at the discretion of the guild leadership. In the event that you are granted permission to change your main, you may be required to play their first main if it will make or break a raid. </FONT></FONT></P><P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>Dual boxers:</STRONG> <BR>Alts that are dual boxed in raids along with your main are eligable to earn DKP at 1/2 value. Alts are (at least at the time of this posting) allowed to bid against main characters, they just earn DKP at half the rate. We do not encourage this, dual boxed alts must get permission to earn dkp in raids and may come to a raid only when they are able to add to the raid, or make it more efficient. The Alt must be a class that is needed at that raid and the Alt must be played effectively (ie: sticking your alt on auto follow and doing nothing for the majority of the raid is not helping the raid and you will not get DKP for it.)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><STRONG>Cross server transfers:</STRONG> <BR>Quality 
cross-server applicants are encouraged to apply, but only applicants with a good 
repuation.&nbsp;Those that are trying to escape a bad reputation on their home 
server aren't welcome in Prime Syndicate. While we do not have many set 
requirements at this time, transfering characters are encouraged to be level 65 
plus AAs and be decently equiped to show that they have put some time and effort 
into their characters.</FONT></FONT><FONT face=Verdana><FONT 
size=1>Transferring clerics are given special priority. 
<BR><BR></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=1><BR><STRONG>Special 
loot:</STRONG> <BR>Special items, like key drops, are often awarded to officers first and then they are usually given out to the people at the raid with the highest raid attendance percentage. Eventually we want everyone to have keys but we must first give these key parts out to those who lead the raids.<BR></P></FONT></FONT></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
