  I was wondering if we could raid some old zones when there are no named or zone mobs up?   I was hoping that we could do Vex Thal [or whatever the hell VT stands for -- probably spelled it wrong too -- could be Kod something too -- sigh dunno --anyway...].   This would help some of us peeps who joined PS without them.   Or could some member of guild (maemae) take us there to get keyed/flagged after a main raid or a night we are not offically raiding?   It would help a few of us peeps out.  I know there are a few spells that the only place I can get stuff for spells drops there.   Anyway,  just a suggestion.
<br />

Also,  there has been alot of guild chatter about raiding GoD zones.  I think these may be fun if nothing to raid.   Btw -- was fun trying a Ldon raid too -- think we may want to try a few more guild sponsered Ldon raids = ).
