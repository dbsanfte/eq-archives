  Sorry this confuses the heck out of me hehe. when I click on new topic i get the smilies and they work just fine for me. Maybe talk with me in game and we can see what the problem is. <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

Under quick reply there is Msg Icon button and a Smiles button

If i click on Smiles the Msg icons apear and not the smiles
<br />
Only way i can use smiles is if i post an original topic

  AH HA! damn I never even tried to use that before <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> well I'm not sure if I can fix it but I do understand what the problem is. I'll try to check into it over the next couple days as time permits.
