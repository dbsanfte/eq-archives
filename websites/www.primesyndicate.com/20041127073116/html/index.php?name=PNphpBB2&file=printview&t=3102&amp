  Not to seem greedy, but I know there had to be a TON of plat in the guild bank and was wondering where that was going to go.  Would hate to see all that plat rot.

  1. Drop, You have my email why you'd post this here I have no f'ing clue. I already posted that these boards and coming down and it was just luck that I read this and it will be luck if you read my reply before I remove these forums.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />
2. There isn't TONS of plat in the guild bank, more like tons tradeskill items and things of that nature. Why random ex-PS members would deserve it, I am sorry i'd have to disagree. I have been speaking with Nikkin and Sinria via email already and the PS guild bank will be transfered to the newly reformed guild should they get it running.
<br />

<br />
Again these boards are coming down so if you need me, email me <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
