  Hello all.  My name is Vernek Zuphlas, 65 wood elf Ranger and ward of his Lady Tunare.  I wander with the group I have chosen to help protect the world of Norrath but my heart goes to the silent woods I came from.
<br />

<br />
I have played EQ since around Nov of 2002 or is it 2001, who remembers anymore.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

I have raided with you on Rallos Zek, Tallon Zek, Terris Thule, and PoFire last night.  Hope to get to know you all well.

  well what can I say here I have known Vern for over a year now and have been a Co GL with him on Maelin. He is very helpful and will go out of his way to help folks as will I. We had a mid level guild with 250 members who we loved dearly but when my sons asked us to come play on Stromm we decided to do so. He is also nicknamed the FACTION KING so look out lol. When we got here we found we had no guild to come to so started  looking at our options and where asked by several guilds to check them out.  Well I meet Fudedorm in PoE one night and he was the first to offer me a group in the Elementals since I got here and well now we have Apped to PS and have really enjoyed our selves with all of you. We are both  excited to be given the chance to be in this guild and hope to get to know as many of you as we can.
<br />

  First of all I want to apologize that Fudedorm was your first impression of us and I hope you don't hold it against us lol.  Snarers are a chanters best friend so looking forward to grouping with you both at some point soon.
