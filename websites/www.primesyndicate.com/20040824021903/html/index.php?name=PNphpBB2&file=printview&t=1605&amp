  Just wanted to poke my nose in and say 'hello' to anyone in PS who doesn't know me.  I've known some of the folks here since, well, since PS was doing practice raids on Kael Arena.  I left EQ a few months back, but as many of you probably know, it's got a certain attaction you just can't resist.  And after hearing about level 70 coming up and Epic 2.0, I figured it's time to give it another go.  
<br />

<br />
I'm applying to PS because I don't like any other guild on stromm, really.  Nothing wrong with 'em, just not for me.
<br />

<br />
Looking forward to seeing all of you more often.  I had fun in PoFire the other night...hopefully I can help you trash Fennin Ro next time.  
<br />

<br />
If you need anything, just give me a holler.
<br />
