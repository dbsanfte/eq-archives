  <span style="font-weight:bold">Gaining Access:</span>
<br />
Members of Prime Syndicate should create an account using the first name of their Main Character. If you create a user with any other name, access will not be granted. Once you have done so, make a post in this forum "Access and Administration Requests" requesting access (tossing me a tell in game doesn't hurt either). Once access is granted, your post will be deleted from this forum. You need to be a probationary member with sponsor, or full member to be granted access.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Regaining Lost Access:</span>
<br />
It is possible that you have lost access to the forums or perhaps even been guild removed because you became inactive. Anyone who goes extended inactive and does not notify the guild risks eventually being removed, even at times if you do notify us and just are gone for months we still may need to revoke your forums and at times even guild status. If you feel this might be the your particular case, please drop me a Private Msg., Email, or speak with any officer in game.
<br />

<br />
Cheers,
<br />
Cherysh
