  Hello PS my name is Rhaaggar and I filled out an app last night.  I am the significant other of Mendeaux.  We live together in sin and she is the one responsible for my EQ addiction.  I as of yet do not have an official sponsor.  I am looking forward to getting to know more of you over the the days to come.  I know I have grouped with some of you but I know Riksan the best.  Hey there Gnome kabobs to be!  Well that is about it except to say Warrior LFG at about 4PM CST today.  See you out there.
<br />

<br />
Strength and Honor!
<br />
