  Hi there Prime Syndicate, WOW you made it to elemental. Grats on that.
<br />
I used to be on your guild when i played EQ but i had to stop =\.
<br />
Well i know some of you will bash me or something dunno but i wanted to know if PS had any plans on having a GUILD up for Everquest 2.
<br />
Why not go back to eq1 well, lets just say ive played it for many years.
<br />
And well i like the fun aspect of starting a mmo when everyone else is new as well. Neways my char was named Forciwiwi 65 Beastlord if any of ya rememberz me, i say hello to yous <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> I miss this game much.
<br />

<br />
So yup thats what i wanted to know, cuz if id join a guild in EQ2 id wanted it to be yours cause sincerely i had a blast with you guys. You took your time doing everything in the game and not just rushing, even if at times it was hell. 
<br />

<br />
So if ps has any plans on having a guild on eq2 i want in.
<br />

<br />
ps i know some of ya will say eq2 sucks, or you guys have to much time invested in the first establishment. yes thats true but dosnt stop you from assigning a leader on eq2 with out everyone moving, bah neways hope to hear from yall soon. thanks,

  Edit: Since my original reply i've done some researching and spoken with several people. I will say this in regards to Everquest 2:
<br />
We are researching EQ2 and while things still remain undecided at this time, it is quite possible PS will have a sister guild in EQ2. If we do decide to make an eq2 sister guild, an official public statement will be made. <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
