  Kelvas, rangers atk unbuffed max is 1620. Because magelo is screwy(it seems to think rangers unbuffed max  atk is 1621) they added a section where u can tinker(add or subtract) an amount to your atk or ac. Ive no idea what you did, but anything over 1621 is human error or fabrication. Just a heads up.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />

  Lol, nice attempts on flaming and starting shit.  How about you pussy tell us who you are?  
<br />

<br />
Doubt you would since you too afraid of letting anyone know.

  This almost comes across as some lame attempt to flame (anon at that)  Email, Priv Msg, Tells in game  are a great way to contact someone if you just want to give them a heads up.  No need to be so anal. Save the drama for your mamma. Will happily ban anyone who comes here with the intent to just start shit. thx.

  npnp maybe you should send me an email so you can know the real truth, since you got your shit messed up, and maybe you should spend a few hours with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005NUNW/ref=pd_sim_sw_1/102-6824464-8441756?v=glance&amp;s=software&amp;n=507846" target="_blank" class="postlink">Mavis Beacon</a>.... it would really make you seem more intelligent

  "Hello" or whoever you are, someone shoulda told your parents that incest was wrong you retarded imbred fuck.  Get off Kelvas's nuts.  Obviously you are a closet homosexual and want his manchowder all for yourself.

  Yeah.....we don't much like Kelvas either <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" border="0" /> , but we don't like him to get shit on either. Good job at invoking the wrath of Draimen though....not many people can do that. Oh wait....yes they can.

  Sooo...im a cross servor transfer and i was wondering if I should just go ahead and app to your guild since im already making such good friends? Honestly, and i swear here, my entire point was LOST on one lousy joke. Remove eroneous profiles from eq rankings PLS. Ty kelvas for fixing your awkward atk. Id have never gotten my inside info if i didnt see your magelo while cheking guilds on stromm. You were the only time geared member of PS. BTW i play a NON-time geared (ele mostly) rogue. AND to draimen, no sir id be happy to share kelvas's "manchowder" with you. But you are totaly getting sloppy 2nds.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" />
