  Hey guys   <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Been a while since I've been around. 
<br />

<br />
This is Deciimus Meridius, frog extrordinare shaman!
<br />

<br />
Its been so long since I got on this board, but I'm killing a minute at work and wanted to pop on to say a few words since I haven't in so long!
<br />

<br />
Miss you guys tons! I made the right move a few months back after finally getting a quality job; I quit playing EQ. Just didnt have the time for it. But lately, past month or so, I found myself back at it again.
<br />

<br />
I had been having some issues with a few things in game and a few people, nobody specifically from our guild but nonetheless, it was time to go. After being on the phone w/my RL best friend for the millionth time, he finally convinced me to return home to my old server. 
<br />

<br />
So 75 bucks later, Deciimus is now on Luclin server back in my original guild, <a href="http://www.endorean.org" target="_blank" class="postlink">Endorean</a>. Its a fine group of people and some of whom I have known in RL for quite some time.
<br />

<br />
Regardless, I felt awful for not saying g'bye to so many. Not going to spit out names cuz i KNOW I'll leave one out  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
So anyways. plz plz plz to send me /tells anytime. ;tell.luclin.Deciimus/Summonere/Liinus/Wood any time you guys wanna bug a frog. I'm on alot lately once again. Miss you all and glad to see you're all having fun and frolicing out in the EP's!! 
<br />

<br />
*hugs*

  Decimus got drunk at my cousin's engagement party back in the spring...  so I feel that makes us close enough that I get to be petty..
<br />

<br />
I've still not forgiven you for outbidding Pyter and I on the AHR neck piece in VT one night.. and then NEVER LOGGING IN AGAIN .. 
<br />

<br />
I would be willing to bet you havent even completed the quest yet and still have the quest piece in your inventory .. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Anyways ..  have fun on your new server ..  but im still mad at you  : )

  lol omg /bonk Nileppez
<br />

<br />
Thats all i have to say about that. OFC i did the quest, like 5 minutes after looting that piece! Ver Kerrath remains one of my best pieces to date! 
<br />

<br />
Equipment and raiding had nothin' to do with me leaving EQ or the server for that matter so i kick ya junk in if you think i planned to loot and scoot!
<br />

<br />
When i left, it wasnt something I had planned to do at all. Just got hit point blank in the face w/reality and EQ took a major backseat. Then once things settled down again, RL best friend kept askin me to come play back on old server so I figured i'd give it a whirl.
<br />

<br />
I really reallly hope you dont think that way of me tho man. You or anyone else in guild for that matter. I never pushed ppl around for loot and the only time i went in bidding on something KNOWING i was going to walk away with it was for that silly neck. 
<br />

<br />
so /flurry bonk Nileppez and shoot me a ;tell Luclin.Deciimus or Summonere or Liinus sometime! Need to play catchup.
<br />

<br />
and BIG grats to Endo on progress thus far, keel dem gods der!

Lakehouse, eh. /bonk. its a boat!

<br />
Actually, I've spent quite a bit of time up there lately. Get this. Ya know when you're sitting at a railroad crossing and waiting for the train to pass and you can hear it blowing that massive horn about a mile and a half away? 
<br />

<br />
LOL bought one. RAWR! Found a place in SC that sells them so we bought one and I just put it up on the boat last weekend! /cheers for massive noise!
<br />

<br />
Now I get to piss off ppl in marina's 2 miles away from ours, WEEEEEEEE...
<br />

<br />
Rokke, i'm afraid you'd try to blow the horn after a few rounds of tequila at 3am.

<br />

<br />
We keep getting all the mezzed ones locked down, under control, then the 6 rooted &amp; under control.
<br />

<br />
Then 11 out of the 12 beat down to 3%, then all hell breaks loose... GDI pull tha trigger! lol. Sorry, cant flame my own boards cuz i know everybody's pissed about the same bit.
<br />

<br />
Its hard to come so far on that damn encounter, then walk away from a 5 hour raid empty-handed and demoralized. 
<br />

<br />
You guys tried RC yet? uggh, i wanna hear some strategy in case we're doin' something wrong ova here! 
<br />

<br />
Rokke. No tequila for joo. I'd hate to imgine you twisting "Every rose has its thorn" &amp; "I will always love you" IRL. MWHAHAHAHA.

  S'ok. I dont think anyone "really" likes tequila. Just the one alcohol that can make your tongue numb, toes tingle and have you singing to any Waffle House waittress like she was Juliet.
<br />

<br />
Its scary. 
<br />

<br />
Damn, got sig working too lol.

  Was tryin' to talk to Rokke last night but he was busy. Wanted to ask, does Rhak still play? havent said hi to kitty in a while hehe...
<br />

<br />
Anyhow, how'd Corinav go? that encounter's such a pain in the ass. I hate timed encounters. Not cool. How am i supposed to organize the right amount of chaos when everyone wants to focus? Not to even mention the lack of leg humping time. blah.
<br />

<br />
Hope you guys squashed his fishy ass!

  Was in middle of encounter when u sent me tells <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0" /> Anyhow, Rhak retired from EQ a few months ago, probably not long after you took time off. Have yet to see or hear from Rhak ever since :/
<br />

<br />
btw. got Corinav to 45% before we wiped... had trouble getting all the babies away to do enough dmg.. but we killed Xegony!

  Awsome, Grats on Xeg!!
<br />

<br />
Endo did Xeg right before I came back to the game, so I still lack that damn flag, but we attempted Corinav last night and got it to 18% before we all got TL'd to PoK. Sick. Like, 10 more seconds and we would have won.
<br />

<br />
Hate that encounter. Its all cuz we had a small delay on the first named kill and that put us behind on the damn timer. grr. 
<br />

<br />
So Xeg &amp; Fennin down, woohoo!! 1/2 way there and a damn fine attempt on Corinav also! So close! 
<br />

<br />
Damn tho, bummer to hear about Rhak <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> Miss tha kitty. LOL all these ppl i spent hours farming shards with have disappeared! wthell.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />

<br />

<br />
LOL @ Soothesayer Deciimus... how lame. 
<br />

<br />
All the lvl 70 titles are so weak, minus like, Saint for Paladin and a few others. Finally got Decii time flagged, right before expansion lol. Leave it to me to always be a day late and a buck short lol. Rathe was suck till last night :-p  Anyhow. 
<br />

<br />
You guys playing with any GoD content yet? Ppl in our guild I think are wanting now to farm EP/Time on off days and focus on GoD &amp; the scream to lvl 70 as fast as possible. Its gonna suck having to grind xp again. Blaaa... 
<br />

<br />
Interested to find out how fun the new AA's are going to be and how trivial its going to make EP's. Hopefully not too rough! 
<br />

  lol dont ya love it? SoE needs to give our guilds like, a "bye" on expansions lol. just a bit more  time to catch up! I get the feeling EQ2 isnt going to take off as they're hoping tho...
<br />

<br />
Lots of people seem disappointed in the Beta so far, from what i've heard its just basicly DAoC on Steroids (as far as graphics are concerned). I dont think anyone i've talked to is impressed by the gameplay or whatnot.
<br />

<br />
So maybe that'll let our guilds gain a bit of ground on the expansions and get all caught up <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

<br />
Anyone done their epics yet? Liking lvl 70? LOL only way i was going to get 70 was to just farm PoE &amp; PoF groups till it was done... God that hurt... but... done.
<br />

<br />
Now on to the epic! Shammy epic looks so cool! And easy ta boot! Totally rejuvinated the spirit tho with the new expansion. This is the first expansion I've liked in quite a while, pry since PoP.
<br />

<br />
Ok, well just wanted to see how things are goin' over here. Miss all you guys and still lack many ;tell luclin.deciimus dangit! Every time i try to x-server /tell you guys the ppl i shoot for are never on! /sniffle

<br />

<br />
You guys having a bit of trouble with the lvl's being an issue? Strangely, we are lol.. ie, doing the rathe encoutner, we'll have a lvl 70 chanter on a mob but if something goes wrong and he loses the mez and someone else has to take over... cant overwrite his spells... = 2... 3. 4 chanters down... wipe. gdi.
<br />

<br />
a 5-8 hour encounter down cuz a lvl 67 chanter couldnt take over for a lvl 70 one. /rude SoE... not cool.

Got into Time, right before OOW release, but now ppl are lvl 66-70 and they dont understand why we're getting pwned by god's lol... Creating havoc...

<br />

<br />
We were going to knock off all the gods one more time then enter Time rotation again... but now we dont have the heal power to do Rathe... gdi lol... What the hell is wrong with people?
