  Hello all,
<br />
Well to my discovery, I can't get the internet transerred from my previous command to temporery holding (read previous post).  I hate to say this but I have no clue when I can get on next for sure, it will probably be a couple months.  If you qoud like me to advance with flags, then I would suggest botting me.  If that is the plan, please conactc Soliah and tell her to call me for my information on  my account.  Those I need to speak to about botting (so I can atleast Yibiiner, Cherysh, or Duskin.  Please cnotact me at 252-315-6615 if needed for the botting and account information.  If you are not one of these people and are viewing this, please notify one of these people to call me.  I really appreciate it and good luck to you all and I will be back as soon as possible.  Thanks!
<br />

  How frustrating for you.  Being in the military really leaves you in a bind sometimes... because they actually "own" you for a period of time.  I wish you the best of luck and will be happy to see you return.

I hope you get to travel and see some exciting places =)
