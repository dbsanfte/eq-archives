  Hiya Lexapros,
<br />

<br />
I think I found out the problem with your account and why it bugged out. I had to change your user name to just 'Lexapros' instead of &lt;Lexapros&gt;. I had to change your password too unfortunately. i'll email the new password to the address you used when you set up your account.
