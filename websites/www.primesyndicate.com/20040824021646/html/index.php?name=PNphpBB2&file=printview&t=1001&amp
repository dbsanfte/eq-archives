  <b>Post subject: </b>Help: Work and Hawaii<hr width=95% class="sep"/>
  I need to talk to some peeps from this wonderful guild about boting Barolumsas for me (JUST for flags I cannot raid or other events officers see fit) so that i won't be left in the dust and not feel like a contributing memeber of the guild.  Anyone who has grouped with me knows how important it is to me to be helpful.  In my opinion I cant be too helpful when I cant even get into more and more areas the rest of the guild are adventuring in.  My work scheduel changed to the point I am only able to be on a couple times a week at "normal" hours.  Also, I am going to Hawaii for a personal retreat and will not be near a computer for 2 weeks.  I hope the withdrawls dont kill me!  I will be leaving the 18th of this month and returning the 31st.  Anyone who can help please respond to this or send me a tell in game.  I will be eternally grateful for ANY assistance.... I also understand how difficult it is to do what I am asking.  Any suggestions or comments are always welcome.  I am the type of player who is always expanding my EQ knowledge and love to learn anything I can about my alter life lol.  Thanks Jeff, aka Barol
