  Hello,
<br />

<br />
I submitted an application to join your great guild. I'd like to post a little about my me in case any of you have any questions. I came to Stromm just recently after being away from EQ for almost a year. During that time I found I was missing the friends I had made during the 3 years I played on the Tribunal server. Just about all the people I cared about left Tribunal and started characters on Stromm. Almost all of them are in your guild. I'd love to be able to join them and raid with them once again if you'll have me. I LOVE playing a rogue! I was a high level rogue on Tribunal and had a character that was very much like the character I now have on Stromm. I admit I'm a little rusty from my time away but given a little time to sharpen my skills and I'm confident I can be a great contributor to this guilds success in the future. 
<br />

<br />
Thank you,
<br />

<br />
Sylk

  This is one of those people that makes me smile from ear to ear just to know that he is around.  He held the position of my Gnomish Protector on Tribunal.  Nobody messed with Riffy (mah drupid) when he was around !  /giggle.  Chances are that no matter what name he has, you will see us ex-Tribunal folks call him Wump.  Old habits die hard.  He is and always will be my Wump.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
To my Wump,
<br />

<br />
Welcome home sweetie.  God only knows how much I have missed you.  You are a great representation of the old saying - "If you love something let it go.  If it was yours it will come back to you.  If it doesnt, it was never yours to begin with."  I let you go over a year ago.  It was one of the hardest things Nile and I have ever done.  But, I always knew that we would be together again one day, somewhere.  You are going to love Prime Syndicate.  These people are great.  Duskin and Cherysh are some of the greatest folks that I have ever had the pleasure of being guilded with and being friends with.  I can't wait to see where our new adventures take us.  And you being here with us just makes my world all the brighter.
<br />

<br />
FEEL THE WUMP !!!!
<br />

P.S.  Wumpers...stay outta Karnors !  /evil grin

  Wump was the 2nd biggest pain in the ass and troublemaker we had in our guild on Tribunal .. 
<br />

<br />
But since the worst one is currently in PS .. /wave Rokke .. Then I think he will fit in great here.. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Good to see you around again Wump ..  We'll get you on some raids and groups and stuff so you can get to know the people here in PS ..   Good group of folks for the most part and Im sure you will enjoy yourself ..  We will see how you get used to having just one character .. You are spoiled from the stable of 65s you had on Trib .. 
<br />

<br />
maybe I'll let ya borrow Coaster sometime : )
