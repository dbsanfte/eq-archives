  <b>Post subject: </b>Coming to Stromm from Vazaella !<hr width=95% class="sep"/>
  Hello and greetings to you all,
<br />
I am coming from Vazaella to Stromm very soon and will be looking to join a guild much like i left. Due to the caotic madness of 12+ EP guilds on the server and lack of mobs to be killed and talking with people of 12 different servers i choose Stromm to be my new home of choice. 
<br />
I am bringing with me 3 characters. 
<br />
Character # 1  65 Druid  Danzing  80AA's
<br />
Saryn hit away from EP flag , Have Fennin's shield piece
<br />
EP ornate / regular ornate armor equipped. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Character #2 65Monk Coub 74AA's 
<br />
Saryn hit away from EP flag
<br />
Ornate armor equipped + other nice drops like  belt of dwarf slaying , hand of honor so on. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Character #3 65Warrior Handaar 101AA's
<br />
EP flagged, Need EP Gods pieces for TIME 
<br />
items from most oldworld zones are equipped such as sleepers tomb , and Vex.
<br />

<br />
These 3 toons will be brought to Stromm soon. I have great experience with heavy raiding guilds. I am on from 4pm CST - 2am CST weekdays ..Weekends maybe more maybe less. 
<br />

<br />
I do hope you consider this application and let me put in some work for  Prime Syndicate.
