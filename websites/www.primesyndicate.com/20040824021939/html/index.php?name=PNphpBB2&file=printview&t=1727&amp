  Hiyas guys and gals, just wanted to go ahead  and introduce myself... And, let everyone know , I am very excited about the possibility of joining your guild.  I have seen most of you guys  for along time, and merely  said hi  or exchanged the  occassional  buffs or two.  But, with a lick of bad luck one night in Late November, some things changed, and well my guild before fell apart while I was afk for bout 6 months.  For all that don't know, I was a member of Avalanche of Power, later Leader, and worked out a merge with  Lost Sock Patrol, which was a damn good guild, and was happily there for quite some time.  Welp ,  the guild did split, and it appears LSP went into 3 seperate factions mainly, I tried to join with my old friends once i got back to eq, and  yeah the uber uber zerg guilds i guess don't want o invest in me,  and i learn valueable lesson, haha  jokes on them  i don't want to waste investment with them.  PS, FD, VA  was what i was targeting anyways,  and i am glad i choose PS.
<br />

Little bit about me,  my name is Paul G.  I grew up in Panama City Bch, FL, and went into the Marines after HS, got out here via the 4 year trip, to California, met my current wife (14 years in Jan) . and had 3 kids (all daughter hehe- can you say who'd got a big shot gun??) .  We struggled like most coupled do, but time has paid off now, we own our own business, which affords me alot of time to play computer games, building crap in my backyard, and playing with my kids.  I am not the smartest by far, but not quite the dumbest,  I just like to be positive, and njoy things as they come.  I  like teamwork, and kicking virtual monster ass, so hopefully we can do some of that together <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
I use Ventrilo as a voice com, and if anyone would like to use it as well feel free to contact me in game, and i can get ya the port and ip ,  and help ya set it up if need be.  diffiantly it is nice to have on raids, for group leaders/raid leaders to be able to push to talk voice com.    just let me know  what i can do to help around here and i'll be doing it with a smile on me face <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Thanks for allowing me the chance to Be a recruit, and i hope we have many battles together kicking major butt, i got 6 months of butt kicking to catch up on:)
<br />
