  <b>Post subject: </b>If you were inactive and cut from guild...<hr width=95% class="sep"/>
  Prime Syndicate has always held the standard that RL &gt; EQ.
<br />

<br />
We have always tried to be thoughtful and patient when our members needed to take time off for RL issues. Unfortunately, as time has passed we've ended up so many inactive members on our roster that it became frustrating to manage. Due to this many of our inactive members have been cut. Cuts were made on a case  to case basis. We did our best to check posts people made to see why they were gone, but in most cases to keep it simple, if you find that you have been removed from the guild due to inactivity and either
<br />
 
<br />
a) Are unable to come back at this time but would like forums access (and/or) 
<br />
b) Will be returning to active status in EQ and wish to be re-tagged 
<br />

<br />
ALL you need to do is send me or any officer a priv msg here on the forums, E-mail, or a tell in game.
<br />

<br />
This post has been made public to help let anyone who was cut understand what happened and why. This in no way is meant to be personal, it was done out of need not because we didnt care or want you.
<br />

<br />
Respectfully,
<br />
Cherysh
