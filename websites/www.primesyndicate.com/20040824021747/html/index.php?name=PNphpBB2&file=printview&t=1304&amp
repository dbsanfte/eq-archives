  Hello all.  I've taken a fair amount of time researching guilds to find a balance that will serve both the guild and my needs.  After talking with friends in PS I feel that I can learn a tremendous amount from your guild and also that I can contribute to the goals of PS as well.  Please feel free to contact me in game with questions or group invitations.  I look forward to meeting more members of PS to demonstrate my personality and skills.  
<br />

<br />
Thank you,
<br />

<br />

  Bardtail, please speak with a member of the recruitment team in game. Need to know what your availability is cause so far i've not seen you at a raid yet, and we need people to be pretty active to be considered. Thanks <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

  Certainly.  I have been in the recruit channel almost nightly and attended 2 raids so far.  One as a guest and one as an applicant.  Additionally I've tried to attend another one but never received word back on when or where to meet.  
<br />

<br />
My problem is that I'm trying to walk a fine line of showing interest in the guild and wanting to join in, and being too pushy in asking to attend every raid.  I've talked to other members to try and make sure I'm not being too forceful in offering my services, but I've offered them on at least 2 or 3 occasions since applying.  
<br />

<br />
Not trying to be argumentative, I just want to demonstrate that I have attended raids and made good faith efforts to attend others.  As always, thank you for the information and consideration.

  Had a chance to go along with Dropthe and several others into Chardok tonight.  Had a great time and am looking forward to doing something tomorrow night.

  No worries, Bardtail. When it comes to the recruit process, it is highly preferred to attempt to join us on every raid rather than sit back and never lift a finger. It shows how interested you are in being part of our family... and we do take note.
<br />

<br />
However, on some raids there just isn't room for recruits. I seen a few 72-man raids recently. I don't speak officially, but I believe our stance is members first, recruits second, backflaggers third.
<br />

<br />
I haven't had the chance to meet you in-game yet, but from what I see on the boards you conduct yourself in a manner that I appreciate. So I'm looking forward to meeting you.

  Bardtail is a kewl guy he tries. I have been talking to him last couple of days found out that somehow there is a information blockage between him and raids and such. Should be better after today ill be in contact with him.

  I have grouped with Bardtail a number of times and am impressed with his knowledge of his class and willingness to help group.  He has gone out of his way to help others when in need and his manerisms are pleasent in game.  I have not heard any complaints from anyone who has grouped with or crossed his path.  I also saw him sit outside PoE for almost the entire raid waiting for invite (had my shammy bot camped outside for buffage).  That was this last raid we did on thurday the 10th.
