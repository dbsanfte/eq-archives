  I used to have the same problem actually. I had to reinstall EQ everytime I logged out, it wouldnt patch. I had bought a new EQ disk, but I guess THAT was the problem, the disk was messed up not my comp. I mean I had the crappiest comp that was still being used. After I got the new disk, I had no problems, even on the old comp. *shrug* Just a suggestion.

  i got a new CD but i now have this mssg :
<br />
Everquest was unable to initialize the file EQMAIN.DLL.
<br />

<br />
You may wish to try rebooting, deleting EQMAIN.DLL and re-starting everquest
<br />

<br />
...well i have done those things but havent contacted technical support reason i havent is becuase if they fix it i will still have a sucky comp the graphics when it did start to work really sucked and i couldnt get UI's makes it hard for me to get back into the game how it was so i been searchin on Ebay an such will spend around 800 dollars ...maybe lookin for a total gaming type computer 512MB 40 or 80 GB P4  anyone got any reliable resources send a link or phone number plz

  intergrated means---- if something goes wrong with your graphics card--- you have to get a whole new motherboard--- because--- its built into one another--. and-- if game gets upgraded and  they say you need to upgrade you G-card <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" />  you fauct   <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> cawz you cant pull it out if its built into the Mboard..... so on so forth <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
YOU  do NOT want intergrated anything ina computer
<br />

  DB is somewhat true, VIDEO cards in motherboards are 99% shitty.  However if you get a new video card to go into the PCI / AGP port, you can ALWAYS disable to integrated video card either via bios settins or a jumper.  The only thing that works great integrated in montherboards are NIC's and sound drivers.  These two generally don't get out of date every other week, so having them integrated into the motherboard has several benefits.  Like not having to buy that component saving you money, it reduced the heat inside your computer from the lack of another component producing heat, and that card blocking air flow. 
<br />
If you notice at the bottom of that bid screen -- you can upgrade to a fairly nice ATI card for  160 bucks.  Now this is more expensive than going out and buying that same video card, but my guess would be they install it for you before shipping it.  If they do install it, and you're not very computer savvy, I would recommend if you can afford it to go ahead and blow that extra 160 on that card -- making sure that they install it for ya.
