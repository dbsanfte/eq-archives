  I met Chapavien quite a while ago.  He's been a regular group member for my wife and I before I joined PS.  I haven't had as much time as I'd like to hang out with him lately so it'd be cool to see him on raids with us.  I know I can't sponsor him but I would if I could.  
<br />

PS.....Chap, I miss your wizard!!  Nuke something for me.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

  I have grouped with a lot of possible recruits.... Chap by far is the best so far!  He knows his class, plays it well and his personality fits right in.  This would be the first recruit i would be willing to sponsor because I am that confident in his abilities and personality!  He could bring a lot to our guild and continue to carry the good name PS has built for itself.  I know Traskul is willing to sponsor Chap as well so I am confident he will be a wonderful addition to PS!

  Glad to see that Chappy is joining.  He is a great person and we used to be guildies in our old guild.  Glad to see that he wants to join and would love to see him in
