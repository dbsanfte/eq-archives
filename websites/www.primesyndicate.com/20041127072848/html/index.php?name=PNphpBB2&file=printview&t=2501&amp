  So, I said I was quitting EQ, but where did I say I was leaving the guild? Thanks for removing my access to the member area. I am taking this as I am not a member of the guild anymore. Best of luck to ya'll, it was fun while it lasted.
<br />

<br />
Now you have guildremoved two dedicated members.....

  Perhaps your access was removed because you made an ass of yourself and we didn't want any more drama? Some people can't take a hint.

  Awww man <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> what happened?
<br />

<br />
Drama is suck. I know the new expansion is making people howl at the moon a bit more than normal. Is on Luclin too. People deguilding for absolutely no reason at all.
<br />

<br />
We get into time and raids all but stop b/c ppl want to xp or work on Epics (finished mine, /cheer lion's head on a stick!)
<br />

<br />
Its going to be turbulent waters for us on Luclin I think till people get their rune farming &amp; lvling done but as always, the stronger guilds will prevail and the cream will rise to the top.
<br />

<br />
ofc. Rokke. /tell me sometime or IM CptLanier bud. You leave and I got no more bards to flame <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />~

  You quit eq, so why would you remain in guild?
<br />

<br />
And traskul has a very valid point, deciding to quit eq and go out with a BANG.  Just doesn't work.
<br />

<br />
And Deci, you are so correct, this is same thing that happened during PoP and with spec/runes.   Brings the worst out of people.  
<br />

<br />
Those who want to raid all the times, get grouchy since not everyone level fast enough.  Those who like raiding but do not have enough time ask for more time off to level up.  It is a cluster =)
<br />

<br />
And rokke us removing your access does not make us lose two dedicated members, you deciding to quit might have.  But thats something completely different from what you are trying to stir up here.
