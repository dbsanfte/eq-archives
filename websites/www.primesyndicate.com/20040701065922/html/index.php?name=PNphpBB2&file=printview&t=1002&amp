<br />
------------------- 
<br />

<br />
Headlines! 
<br />
Gates of Discord content retuned! 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Gates of Discord 
<br />
------------------- 
<br />
- Zone experience modifiers were increased in all zones from Tipt/Vxed and beyond. 
<br />
- Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more appropriately for their intended level ranges. 
<br />
- NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs they previously had difficulty with. 
<br />
- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit for the zone. 
<br />
- NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably. 
<br />
- Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered by changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced on several NPCs. 
<br />
- Spell drops have been increased. 
<br />
- Increased the rate of cash drops. 
<br />
- The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn rate. Their item drop rate has been increased to compensate for this. 
<br />
- Breakdown in Communication quest now has improved rewards! 
<br />

<br />
Collision 
<br />
------------------- 
<br />
More improvements to the collision system should make it a lot more difficult to get stuck. 
<br />

<br />
Misc. 
<br />
------------------- 
<br />
The Eye of Zomm will once again open closed doors.

Yay!  This might mean I may actually be able to afford Fo7 in the somewhat near future!

  I think they mean they have increased the spell drops in GoD Darsa, not in pre-GoD. Though I think groups can go to GoD a lot easier now.

  BAH!  Well then, they need to start having the mobs drop shaman spells in GoD then.  Easy as that, right?  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" border="0" />
