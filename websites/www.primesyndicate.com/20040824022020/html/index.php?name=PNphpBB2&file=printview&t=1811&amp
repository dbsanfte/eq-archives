  OH NO!!! Not another Beastlord!!
<br />

<br />
Yeah, im afraid so.  But i hope to not be just any other beastlord.  I hope i can add something to PS.  I hate mobs, and like to play alot.  That should be a great combo.  I went on the past couple of raids, in POA, although unsuccessful, i still had fun, and hope to join you guys on alot more.
<br />

<br />
I like what pretty much everyone else likes, advancing in Planar Progression, and wracking up those loots.  Im ancxious to see everyone getting more and more geared up, and fighting our way into Time together as a team.
<br />

<br />
I have just over 500 AA, and would like to have over 600 by the end of the year.

  I am sorry for not being able to attend any raids for the past week.  Im in the Air Force, and since my unit has a number of people deployed to the desert, I have to swap shifts alot to so that we have adequate coverage.  
<br />

<br />
For a few days i was working swingshift, 3pm-11pm, and now i had to move to graveshift, 11pm-7am.  
<br />

<br />
Hopefuly my shift will straighten out in the next few days or so, and i will be able to rejoin you.
