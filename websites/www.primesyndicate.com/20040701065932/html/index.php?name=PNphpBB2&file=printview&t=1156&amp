  Just to clue everyone in for as much as I know so far, I received my orders and have found out I am going to New London, CT for a few months for sub training.  I don't know if I will have in-room internet access or not, but hopefully I can work something out.  I am heading there on May 28th and have to check in by May 30th.  I am really looking forward to getting back in to the game!  I just have a lot of catching up to do <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" />  Good luck to everyone and I hope everything is going well in-game and RL.
