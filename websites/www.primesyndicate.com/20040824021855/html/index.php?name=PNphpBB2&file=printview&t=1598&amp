  I'am a 65 Mage and I have been playing Everquest for almost 1 year now, I got 23 AA's and they are spent in: run3, regen3, scf3, scm1, and earth form1. I would like to start raiding more often and seeing what elementals and anything else is like, I currently have 1/4 of my time flag (Xegony down) and no where near elementals, I'd like to get into elementals before I get into time. Heard a lot of good things about this guild and hope its all true. I haven't been in a guild for quit a while, been going solo so I could get more things done like lvl'ing and AA's. I probably would have about 60 AA's or more but I went without a computer for about month because something happened to my operating system, It was time for a new computer, so now I got this uber sic computer and I'm back for good, I play everyday from around 2 to whenever, unless I go out of town, go to a party, or to a friends house. Hope to be apart of this fine guild, send me a tell in game if you got any questions, later  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />
