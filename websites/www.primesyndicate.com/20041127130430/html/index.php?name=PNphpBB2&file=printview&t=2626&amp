  Hello friends.. 
<br />

<br />
I log on today and notice my membership in the guild is no more.. 
<br />
I told Duskin about 3 months ago that I would be taking a break for the simple fact that I needed to bring my grades at school up.   I almost lost my scholarship due to the EQ bug.  (TMI)
<br />

<br />
Duskin assured me that I wouldn't be booted.  Since I did have a valid reason and gave him a heads up. 
<br />

<br />
I want to start getting back in the swing of things. but I no longer have a guild.(Hense the problem)   There for I'm sueing ps for 2 Million dollars for my pain and suffering.   =)
<br />

<br />
Jeff (Drakeon) Horton
<br />
Soon to be owner of ps =)
<br />

<br />
PPPPLEASE me back in...
<br />
OH BTW. Congrats Duskin and Cherysh on the Baby..  
<br />
I miss everyone very much.. 
<br />
  
<br />
Hope to see you soon..
