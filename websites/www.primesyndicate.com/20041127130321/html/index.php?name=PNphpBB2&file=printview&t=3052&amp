  Whats up guys .. 
<br />

<br />
thought I would stop in and say a final Hi / Bye 
<br />

<br />
EQ2 was released yesterday so I have cancelled the Nileppez account ..  I wont be selling the character because I dont want to take the chance that some idiot buys the character and runs around ruining my reputation by helping people, being nice,  etc .. 
<br />

<br />
Thanks for all the fun and adventure we shared together during my time in PS .. I'll miss some of you more than most,  and most of you more than some ..  Thanks Duskin for letting me tag along and showing me things I never got the chance to see in my guild on Tribunal server . 
<br />

<br />
Dani and I will be starting a small casual guild on the Blackburrow server in EQ2 with a dozen or so close friends .. so if you ever find yourself in EQ2 and on the Blackburrow server ..  be sure to toss us a tell and say Hi .
<br />

<br />
Deiokes , Human Rogue  (Nileppez)
<br />
Rifkind, Human Druid (Danirica) 
<br />

<br />

<br />
thanks again for everything guys, and good luck to you wherever your path leads you
