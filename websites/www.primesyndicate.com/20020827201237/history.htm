<p align="center"><u><font face="Factor" size="5">THE STORY BEHIND THE BAND</font></u></p>

<p align="center">July 2000</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Factor" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our story begins
when Desmond and Nick, at the time employed as lowly file clerks at a private law firm in
southern Orange County, meet for the first time. Desmond, a recent college
graduate from Cal State Long Beach, realizes that he cannot let his college
education go to waste, hence, he decides he wants to be a rockstar. Nick, has
also come to the same realization. He has had musical training since the 2nd
grade and he strongly believes that this entitles him to rockstar status. Never since Lennon met
McCartney has their been such a union of musical minds. Having large amounts of
time on their hands as a result of their boring, yet well-paying, summer job,
the two cleverly devise a plan to start a band. They call their band Access
Denied (since changed to <font color="#FF0000"> Prime Syndicate</font>, but we'll get to that later).</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Factor" size="3"> Desmond and Nick
first decide to look for a singer for Access Denied. Not really having any idea
what sort of music they want to play, they begin looking for
someone who can sing. They search low and high. Finally, they find this guy Dave and he has always wanted to be a rockstar. He definitely looks like
a rockstar, so after talking with him, Desmond and Nick agree to go over to
his house for a jam session (that is, if a bassist, guitarist, and singer
getting together with no drummer, no songs, and next to no equipment can be
considered a jam session). The first meeting went
well, so the three agree that they should begin looking for the next ingredient
commonly found in a decent band...a drummer. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Factor" size="3">August 2000</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Factor" size="3"> Some guy named Mike finds a &quot;drummer wanted&quot; flyer at the local music store. Mike is 19,
just out of high school, and ready to become a rockstar. He calls the number on
the flyer and finds out the situation. &quot;Partially formed band in need of a
drummer.&quot; Mike likes the sound of this. Only one problem, he doesn't play
drums. The members of Access Denied decide to meet with him anyways. Mike brings
along his guitar, the instrument he does play. After the meeting, all parties
involved decide that having two guitars would be better than having one (more
noise), so Mike is adopted into the band.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Factor" size="3">Late September 2000</font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Factor" size="3"> Nothing much going on
with the band at this point. Weekly practices, a few songs written, and many
sleepless nights dreaming about becoming rockstars. Dave is seeing this
hot Brazilian girl (who will go unnamed) who has a friend that has just come to
California from Brazil. One practice, Dave explains about the Brazilian who has just come to California. The other band
members think to themselves, &quot;Who cares...some Brazilian dude...&quot; However, this Brazilian plays drums. In fact, he KICKS ASS on drums.
&quot;Big J&quot;, his given nickname by the band, is inducted into the band. He
does not yet know the meaning of or how to stay rockstar in English, but already
he knows that he wants to be one. It is at this point that the band, now fully
formed, takes the name of <font color="#FF0000">Prime Syndicate</font><font color="#FFFFFF">.</font></font></p>

<p align="center">April 2001</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The immigration authorities find &quot;Big
J&quot; and he gets deported to Brazil! Just kidding. In reality, he decides
that he wants to go back home to his family and girlfriend. He is a kick ass
drummer and he is sorely missed by all who know him. What happened with the
band? They decide to take the summer off. Well okay, they kind of disband for
the summer. Okay okay, they break up. But don't worry, it is only temporary.</p>

<p align="center">December 2001 - present</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in contact with one another, the four remaining members of <font color="#FF0000">Prime Syndicate</font><font color="#FFFFFF">
decide to get back together. Only one problem...no drummer. In steps Greg, who
had previously played in numerous bands. He is amazed when he meets this group
of highly talented musicians. Well, maybe only mildly amazed. Okay, in
truth, he is shocked at how badly these so-called musicians suck. But for some
reason he always comes to practice and wants to jam with them. Greg, while he
has experienced a taste of success in his previous bands, knows he is not yet a
full-blown rockstar and must join </font><font color="#FF0000">Prime Syndicate</font><font color="#FFFFFF">
to achieve this goal.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">And so, the syndicate was formed. Like the
uniting of Voltron, these members came together in order to bring this world
quality music (and to become rockstars in the process).</font></p>
