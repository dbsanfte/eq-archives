  Hello PS  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" /> 
<br />
My name is Sekashi and I am Bardtail's wife.  I am so excited to finally apply to PS.  Bard has been telling me how much he loves you guys and that I would too.  I have grouped with a few of you while completing Bard's epic and in various groups here and there.   Everyone I have met has been so nice and willing to help.  Some of you even came to help my druid with part of her epic...and you didn't even know me!  That says alot for you all.  I hope you will consider me to be part of the team.  I will offer what I can to the guild and work my buns off to get all my toons up to par.  Thanks for considering me.
<br />
