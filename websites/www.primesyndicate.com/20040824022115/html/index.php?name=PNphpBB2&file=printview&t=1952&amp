  Hello Prime Syndicate folks,
<br />

<br />
I'm Baneangel, and my Warrior is Raamasi, and i've taken an interest into your guild.
<br />

<br />
Some things to know about me are : I'm outgoing, I love to group,  I play EQ everyday like its the last day i'm ever going to log in(pretty much I never log), and I love to raid.
<br />

<br />
Information About my toons:
<br />

<br />
Baneangel - EP/Time/KT/Qvic Flagged, 181 AA's, all my main AA's, along with most of my defensive AA's.  He was guilded in Realm of Insanity, but due to technical problems with my internet connection, it put me out of raiding action for 3 weeks, and I was asked to Reapply at a later time.  I was also guilded recently with Defiant Lemmings, but I felt that it was not a guild for me.
<br />

<br />
Raamasi - She currently needs HoH trials 1-2(not RD), Mithaniel Marr, and Rallos Zek to complete her EP flagging.  She just dinged 65 on wednesday and has 22 AA's which I am working hard to get them up now.  I have Run3, Innate Stamina 3, Natural Durability 3, and 4 AA's banked to buy Area Taunt.
<br />

<br />
My old friend Zarthul has lured me here, and has opted to Sponsor me as an applicant.  We have a history dating back to EoI(low level) times.  My application is for Raamasi, which was okayed that I apply under Raamasi while I bot Baneangel for raids.
<br />

<br />
I hope to see you all soon.
<br />
                           ~Baneangel
