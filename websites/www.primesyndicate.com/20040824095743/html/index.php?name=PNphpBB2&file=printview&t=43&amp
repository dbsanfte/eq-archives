  Current known problems/bugs:
<br />

<br />
- Character roster no longer imports magelo profiles after last weeks patch. This is somethng I cannot fix, it must be fixed either on Magelo or Trilogy Technologies end.
<br />

<br />
- Berserker class is not available for the Character roster. This is something Trilogy Technologies said they would implement and although i've heard of some privately sent out beta releases, I have yet to see any progress on the patch for this.
<br />

<br />
- Berserker class for DKP site. There is a patch for this, but since we dont have any Berserkers in the guild at the moment I've not found the need to implement it.
<br />

<br />
- Not staying logged in. This is not really a bug, It's a caching problem in your internet browser. Some people dont have the problem at all, some do. Try changing some of the settings in yuor browser and see if that helps.
<br />

<br />
- Username/Password text colour when logging into the site from the forums page is white (same colour as the text box). This is not a bug, just makes it hard to see what you are typing if you log in via the forums page vs the front page of the main site. I'll fix this in the near future (ie: when I get around to it hehe)
