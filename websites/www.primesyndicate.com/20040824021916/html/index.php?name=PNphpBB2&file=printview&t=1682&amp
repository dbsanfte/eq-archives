  <b>Post subject: </b>PoE, Saturday July 10, 2004 - Mud Ring incident<hr width=95% class="sep"/>
  Greetings,
<br />

<br />
Today a situation occurred in PoE which caused PS to be unable to complete their raid plans.
<br />

<br />
The situation that caused the problem with PS's raid plans is that somehow the Mud Ring event was triggered at an inopportune time.
<br />

<br />
I promised Duskin I would look into it and find out what I could.
<br />

<br />
----------
<br />

<br />
Let me first say that, as you are aware, DL is new to PoE and unfamiliar with the idiosynchracies of the zone.
<br />

<br />
After spemding some time talking to Nileppez so I could learn where certain landmarks are, I can offer the following summary of the events that occurred today.
<br />

<br />
----------
<br />

<br />
This afternoon (PDT), there were 2 groups of DL xp'ing in PoE.  
<br />

<br />
My group had been xp'ing in the "temple" area, until the big nasty croc spawned.  This made it impossible to pull, so we evacced. We then cleared to and set up camp in the middle of the zone, in the building where the "dust ring" spawns.
<br />

<br />
Another group of DL was xp'ing near the zone.
<br />

<br />
About this time, PS began assembling in the zone-in building.
<br />

<br />
Duskin announced in OOC that PS would be pulling the "stone ring" soon, and that the zone-in area would become dangerous.
<br />

<br />
The DL group that had been xp'ing at the zone moved away from the zone-in, to the west.  They set up their xp camp near the entrance to a room set into the north wall of the zone.  
<br />

<br />
Based on my conversations with Nileppez, it appears that this room is the "mud ring".
<br />

<br />
This group xp'ed there and my group xp'ed inside the "dust ring" building until the time when PS was nearly done with the "stone ring".
<br />

<br />
At this time, our wizard needed to log so we evacced to get a replacement (and zone out to get a KEI refresh).  
<br />

<br />
The northern wall xp group had wiped, and had died 3-4 times while trying to get back to their corpses - so we helped them clear to their corpses.
<br />

<br />
About this time, PS completed the "stone ring" and moved south toward the "temple" and the big nasty croc.
<br />

<br />
My group chose to return to the "ledge" camp where we had been earlier in the day.  We waved at PS as we passed, and received at least one /bonk in return (/scowl Snippet).
<br />

<br />
The northern-wall xp group returned to the zone-in to continue xp'ing, since they discovered that the area to the west was a less savory xp camp.
<br />

<br />
PS killed the big ugly croc, and proceded to move into the "dust ring", where you pulled the mobs from the "vine ring".
<br />

<br />
Shortly after a named mob spawned in the center of the vine ring, I received tells from 2 PS members warning me that the mob was behaving strangely.  I then watched it run all the way to the east wall (just north of the "ledge") and stand there looking at us.
<br />

<br />
PS recovered the errant mob and, I presume, completed the "vine ring".
<br />

<br />
A few minutes later, Duskin sent me a tell asking whether any DL had been killing mobs near the "mud ring", as someone had managed to trigger the event.  Due to my ignorance of the zone, I was unable to answer immediately.
<br />

<br />
I asked the group at the zone-in if they had killed anything like a "mud man" (as I still do not know the name of the mob that triggers the event) and they replied that they had killed some type of mud looking mob that had been trained to the zone.
<br />

<br />
It was our assumption at that time that some unknown person had trained a trigger mob to the zone-in, which was then dispatched by the zone-in group.
<br />

<br />
... however ...
<br />

<br />
After the geography lesson from Nileppez, it appears that the zone-in group may have inadvertantly triggered the event an hour or two earlier - while you were doing the "stone ring" - simply by setting up their xp camp outside that room in the northern zone wall.
<br />

<br />
We do not know for certain what occurred to trigger the "mud ring" event, but this is my best conclusion.
<br />

<br />
On behalf of Defiant Lemmings, I apologize for the inconvenience this caused to Prime Syndicate's raiding plans.
<br />

<br />
I assure you that there was no malice, no attempt to disrupt your raiding plans.
<br />

<br />
Thanks,
<br />

<br />

  I seem to recall we set off a couple ring events when we first were able to enter earth so that's very understandable.  I know I don't know the zone well enough myself so I always let others pull there as they know where everything is.  I for one appreciate the post as those rings are a real pain in the ass and we spent a lot of time clearing them and didn't not have the desired effect after we had finished so it was a little frustrating.  I also didn't have a chance to post on your site, but talked to a couple of your members, but congratulations on the Rallos Zek kill and welcome to elementals.

  We appreciate the explanation.  Like Izamno said, we did this ourselves by accident on one of our first times into POE.  Can't remember who's plans we put a hitch in - AE or FD iirc.  We had to learn, just like you will have to.
<br />

<br />
And grats again on RZ and entrance into the Elemental Planes !

  As I tried to tell you in game, bohr, what happened was nothing that could be resolved afterwards.  Just wanted to make sure it did not happen again as everyone goes through learning new zones. 
<br />

<br />
What really fucked up any possible agreements/relations between PS and DL is that the second I ask you about it your guild leader started sending tells to me and cursing me out, eventually telling me to fuck off.  
<br />

<br />
1) I was not talking to him because, you are the pr officer and venem and us has not worked well together in past.
<br />
2) He innitiated the argument with me even though you are point of contact.
<br />
3) He lied to me saying you guys had nothing to do with it and to talk to Bohr, which I was already doing and you even stated to me in game 1-2 mins prior to this that one of your monks said they possible pulled from the temple.  So Venem jumping to conclusions and denying everything as usual.  Omg flashback to months ago.
<br />

<br />
You told me other night that Venem has changed and want to build relations with other guilds for backflagging so it will benefit all guilds on stromm server.
<br />

<br />
Last night demonstrated he has not changed, he is still the same idiot he was in Defiant Unity, changing guild name doesn't change anything proven once again.  
<br />

<br />
I appreciate your appology, I will add it to the collection of others I received from your guild, for instance Feien and the Grummus incident months ago.
<br />

  I understand how this could happen.  We did it, VA did it, now you guys.  But it is just common courtesy to leave the zone during a ring attempt, or any other scripted event.

I never thought that anything sinister had occured..  but your post here is a welcome sight just in case some others had doubts about people's intentions.. 
<br />

<br />

  No need to leave the zone, you just move out of the way.  We all screwed somebody else's rings up at some point, no biggie.  That's how ya learn. <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" border="0" />

  Aye we did it on accident, but never ever did we remain in zone while another guild was raiding there and triggered anything <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" border="0" /> If you dont know the zone well enough to trigger anything that can screw up the events, yeah in that case one should leave the zone.
