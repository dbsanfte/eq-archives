  Hello all!
<br />

<br />
  I am an experienced 65 warrior seeking a stable home after a tumultuous stint with Primordial Chaos.  Our leadership abruptly went MIA in response to relentless harassment from another guild that was vying for the same VT content that we were working towards.  Within the past week, PC hemmorraged most of its core player base and collapsed. I decided to cut my losses and write off two months of farming VT keys for guildmates and put some distance between myself and the two remaining guilds bickering over high end Luclin zones.
<br />

<br />
  After carefully going over my options on Stromm, I've come to the conclusion that Prime Syndicate fits the bill.  You guys have a strong presence, and by all accounts are a well organized and disciplined raid force.  Most importantly, I see zero inter-guild drama surrounding PS in any forum and everyone who knows you speaks very highly of you.  Oh, and you seem to be nice people.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
  Glancing at your roster, I notice that you are currently flush on main tanks.  No matter.  I am offtank extraordianaire!

  I have the AAs and gear required to generate decent DPS and I am highly skilled in aggro management.  I adhere to raid etiquette and am self sufficient with clicky items and potions for shrink, invis, levitate, etc.  And last but not least, I am low maintenance.  You'll never hear me asking for directions or see me unprepared to fight a mob.  I know how to search on Google or Allakhazam and never pester people for readily available information.
<br />

<br />
  I realize that I am missing a few flags and need to catch up with PS at the elemental level.  I am steadily working on that through open raids and hope to be up to date soon.
<br />

<br />
  My other toons are all on separate accounts.  Their life careers center on loitering around LDoN camps eagerly waiting to buff my groupmates and I.  &lt;grin&gt;

<br />
  Lubna -- 65 Cleric (67aa: Run3, HG3, SCR3, MGB, DR, CR, SCRM, RC1)
<br />

<br />
  My play hours are generally 5pm-12pm PST weekdays and 10am-12pm weekends.  I work from home so you'll see me online during PST business hours, albeit in a semi-AFK state depending on my workload.  My schedule is very flexible and I will often be able to raid during those hours.
<br />

<br />
  I am looking forward to meeting you in game, don't hesistate to send me a tell if you need tankage.  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

  Very well written post.  I've seen you around but we've never run in the same circles.  Hope to do so soon though.
