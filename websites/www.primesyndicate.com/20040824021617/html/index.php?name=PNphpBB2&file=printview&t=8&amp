<span class="Topic">Access and Administration Requests - DKP System Access</span><br />

   <hr />

  <b>Post subject: </b>DKP System Access<hr width=95% class="sep"/>
  <span style="font-weight:bold">For access:</span> 
<br />
To gain access to the DKP system you need to register there separately from these forums. You do not need a DKP account to actually earn DKP, just to view the information that is in the system. To request a DKP account, you must <a href="http://www.primesyndicate.com/eqdkp/register.php" target="_blank" class="postlink">GO HERE </a> and register. When you sign up, you MUST do so using your main characters name as your user name and you also must have a sponsor. If you do not, the registration will be denied. Once you have done that, your registration will be either approved or denied by the DKP administrator. Registration activation requests are usually handled within 24 hours. 
<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">DKP Discrepancies:</span> 
<br />
Just FYI, if you ever have DKP problems, dont come to me about it. There is a DKP forum and you can post your discrepancies there. I Administer the main website and dkp site, however, I dont handle the specific handling of dkp or loot.
