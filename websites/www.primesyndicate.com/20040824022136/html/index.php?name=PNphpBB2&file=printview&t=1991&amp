  hey all sorry ive been gone so long but kind spur of the moment when i went home to see my parents i decided to stay there for the summer and enjoy a truly amazing summer again enclosed in the trees and mountains of new england <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />. so for almost the pats 2 weeks my mom has watched my kids as i gathered my friends and went on a 2 week hiking/camping trip in new hampshire. the kids had fun with gramma and got spolied all over again and i got to go do something ive yearned to do for awhile now but dont see happening until the kids are a bit older. anyways i should be back on around sept. dont know when i will be leaving again though cause hubby is leaving the miliatry soon and we are still discussing on where we want to move but that will come later. see yall soon i miss you all very much and will see you all soon. oh and snip i planted flowers in my moms backdyard they look really pretty now i just hope when next spring/summer comes that they rebloom for her. see yall soon <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

  Glad to hear you had a great summer and glad to hear you're coming back soon.  As Darsa said, wish we had known you'd be as close as New Hampshire as it's only a couple hours away.  See you back in game soon.

  i knew i was going home to massachusetts but i truly didnt think i would have stayed so long or gone hiking in new hampshire but i heard those woods and hills calling to me when i crossed the gate at logan airport. truly being stuck in louisiana just does not suit my temperment of needing the se4asons to grow and thrive. i will truly enjoy seeing seasons again whenever we decide where me and my husband will be moving. its been narrowed down to mass or minnesota
