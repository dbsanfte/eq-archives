  PS:
<br />

<br />
I would like to introduce myself as an applicant to PS.  You may know me best by any of my previous 2 names: Panopticon or Lordoftheflies (and Variation for about 2 mins).  If you care to know the transgression of my nomenclenture, send me a tell and I will let you know all about it  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
PS comes highly recommended as a safe, fun place to be and I look forward to being a guest on a raid and grouping w/ all of you in the future.
<br />

<br />
Finally, I try to have a good sense of humor and make the most of CR.
<br />
