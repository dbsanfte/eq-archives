  Good Evening.
<br />

<br />
Just a notice that I have submitted my application to join PS. Your guild demonstrates the qualites I look for in a guild and your guild mates are professional, well mannered, knowledgeable and wonderful to group with.
<br />

<br />
I look forward to raiding, grouping and getting to know you all more. I will work on getting my magelo to you guys, never can figure that thing out. Elemental Flagged, need Xegony and Fennin for Time. Will work on GoD as much as possible.
<br />

<br />
Again, I look forward to playing with you all, please do not hesitate to send me a tell in game.
<br />

<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
Marauder Lanvar Soulblighter
<br />
65 Rogue

  good guy, good rogue, i have no problem sponsoring you bro.  This is one  of elwrath's requests of me before he left for war so i told him i would sponsor lanvar, who transferred to Stromm because he wanted to be on same server as elwrath, but then elwrath got deployed =\, any friend of elwrath's is a good guy, thumbs up for lanvar.

  Whazzup lanvar played with him tons hes a good rogue for sure I definately support him joining. I believe theres a certain amount of time that you have to be in guild before you can sponsor dees if im not mistaken heh just a heads up.

  No problem....Elwrath also asked me to sponsor him as well before he left. Since my recruit decided to up and leave us, I am free to sponsor him if nobody else is willing. Just lemme know.
