  Howdy all,
<br />

<br />
I hope that the majority of you remember me.  For those of you that do not, I will refresh your memories by say that I was a 64 Dwarf Warrior.  I left EQ about a month or two after we started in Vex Thal.  Well, to make a long story short, I am back playing EQ again.  I have started a froggy shaman and have been tooling around with him.  
<br />

<br />
I would love to rejoin PS if at all possible.  I have missed many of you and am glad to see that you are all whooping arse in the elemental planes now.  I would probably want to rejoin as my shaman if that was possible, since I think part of what drove me away from EQ was my boredom with having played a warrior for so long.
<br />

<br />
Any ways, I chatted briefly to Nileppez and he suggested that I post here in the forums about my wish to return to PS.  I also spoke to Sickler, who said that he would sponsor me if I needed a new sponsor.
<br />

<br />
I look forward to chatting to you all in game again.
<br />

<br />
Aagir

  Hehe...was getting kind of worried there...heard the crickets chirping and the sound of silence was deafening there for a bit.  Glad to hear from you both.  I should be on most of this week.  Have the rest of it off.  Look me up...my shaman's name is Aagiir (how original - eh?)
