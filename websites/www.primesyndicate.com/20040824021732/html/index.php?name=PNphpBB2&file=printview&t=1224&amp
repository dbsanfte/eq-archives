  ...wtf... ELEMENTAL!?!?!
<br />

<br />
/em drops over dead from shock.
<br />

<br />
I can't even BEGIN to say gratz as emphatically as I mean it!  /worship
<br />

<br />
If I said I knew all along you would do it, I'd be lying...so would alot of other people who you probably are hearing that from (alot of them didn't believe you'd ever even make it into VT...I figured you could do that, though, honest!)  But when I say I'm very happy you did it, and that nobody deserves Elementals more than you folks, especially the original members and those who joined last summer, I'm telling the God's honest truth.
<br />

<br />
You folks rock.  Keep up the good work, and keep on chuggin!

  Thanks much hon. Yeah without a doubt it's been a rough road, but I think we've become a better guild for it. Just taking it a day at a time heh and enjoying it. Got a strange app from this guy tonight, can only assume it was a teaser since Animocity it still retired.
