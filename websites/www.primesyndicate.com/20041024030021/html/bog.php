<strong>So you skimmed through the info or didnt bother to read it... Here's the deal:<br>
</strong>
We take a lot of pride in our guild and if you think getting in by doing the least amount of
work you can skim by with, you are mistaken. If you do not understand the requirements or 
put a lack of effort into your application, it will show. You should be very familiar with
all of the content from our charater and recruitment page before you even apply. If you are
too lazy to read all of that then you should reconsider if PS is the right guild for you. If 
you wish to get into PS, you will need to put your heart and effort into it. People who half 
ass to get in will only be half assed members, that is not what we desire.
