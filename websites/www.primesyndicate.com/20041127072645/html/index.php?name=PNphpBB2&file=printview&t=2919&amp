  well I was hoping to download eq on a work laptop while being out of town so I could at least talk to peeps and get in groups while doing nothing here, but dialup really bites when you're trying to load most of eq. I loaded a few cd's and if I would have been thinking I would have opened some new boxes of pop and god that i never opened instead of trying to download it via the net. 
<br />

<br />
10 hours, then another 7 hours now 46 hours. ouch. I think I might have to scratch that idea and load it on this laptop when I get home so if I have to go out of town again, I won't have to go through this dialup fiasco.
<br />

<br />
hope to see you guys after the 2nd.I'd like to get grouped with you guys but I also need a dusty soriz pouch in a bad way so i'm going to try to camp it with my hubbies shami. shuriken are monk killers for pulling pop, god, or oow. <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" />

  well, I broke down and bought yet another complete set of eq, so i wouldn't have the 40 hour download. i dialedup let it run and when i came in this morning the magic play button was displayed.
<br />

<br />
I got a no 3d found. ha ha ha ha. I'm working to see if the 2001 drivers on it are the issue. I'm ugrading them to a 2004 driver since I checked dxdiag and it said I had 3d. I also have the latest directx so it can't be that. 
<br />

<br />
If that doesn't work, i'll just have to wait till i get back home on wednesday. hehe all that work for nothing. oh well

  I got it to work, (the update video drivers did it) but can only get on dialup, I can't get past the firewall on the t1 so I finally gave up.
<br />

<br />
I'll be home in 4 days. Took me 4 days to download the stuff. he he he
