  Hey guys   <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Been a while since I've been around. 
<br />

<br />
This is Deciimus Meridius, frog extrordinare shaman!
<br />

<br />
Its been so long since I got on this board, but I'm killing a minute at work and wanted to pop on to say a few words since I haven't in so long!
<br />

<br />
Miss you guys tons! I made the right move a few months back after finally getting a quality job; I quit playing EQ. Just didnt have the time for it. But lately, past month or so, I found myself back at it again.
<br />

<br />
I had been having some issues with a few things in game and a few people, nobody specifically from our guild but nonetheless, it was time to go. After being on the phone w/my RL best friend for the millionth time, he finally convinced me to return home to my old server. 
<br />

<br />
So 75 bucks later, Deciimus is now on Luclin server back in my original guild, <a href="http://www.endorean.org" target="_blank" class="postlink">Endorean</a>. Its a fine group of people and some of whom I have known in RL for quite some time.
<br />

<br />
Regardless, I felt awful for not saying g'bye to so many. Not going to spit out names cuz i KNOW I'll leave one out  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
So anyways. plz plz plz to send me /tells anytime. ;tell.luclin.Deciimus/Summonere/Liinus/Wood any time you guys wanna bug a frog. I'm on alot lately once again. Miss you all and glad to see you're all having fun and frolicing out in the EP's!! 
<br />

<br />
*hugs*

  Thanks for visiting Deci, a lot of people here cared and I always wondered what happened to you. I'm glad that RL and EQ is working out for you once again. Good luck in all that you do <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

  Decimus got drunk at my cousin's engagement party back in the spring...  so I feel that makes us close enough that I get to be petty..
<br />

<br />
I've still not forgiven you for outbidding Pyter and I on the AHR neck piece in VT one night.. and then NEVER LOGGING IN AGAIN .. 
<br />

<br />
I would be willing to bet you havent even completed the quest yet and still have the quest piece in your inventory .. 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Anyways ..  have fun on your new server ..  but im still mad at you  : )

  lol omg /bonk Nileppez
<br />

<br />
Thats all i have to say about that. OFC i did the quest, like 5 minutes after looting that piece! Ver Kerrath remains one of my best pieces to date! 
<br />

<br />
Equipment and raiding had nothin' to do with me leaving EQ or the server for that matter so i kick ya junk in if you think i planned to loot and scoot!
<br />

<br />
When i left, it wasnt something I had planned to do at all. Just got hit point blank in the face w/reality and EQ took a major backseat. Then once things settled down again, RL best friend kept askin me to come play back on old server so I figured i'd give it a whirl.
<br />

<br />
I really reallly hope you dont think that way of me tho man. You or anyone else in guild for that matter. I never pushed ppl around for loot and the only time i went in bidding on something KNOWING i was going to walk away with it was for that silly neck. 
<br />

<br />
so /flurry bonk Nileppez and shoot me a ;tell Luclin.Deciimus or Summonere or Liinus sometime! Need to play catchup.
<br />

<br />
and BIG grats to Endo on progress thus far, keel dem gods der!

  /em continues to troll...

<br />
 <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" border="0" /> 
<br />

<br />
Lakehouse, eh. /bonk. its a boat!
<br />

<br />
Actually, I've spent quite a bit of time up there lately. Get this. Ya know when you're sitting at a railroad crossing and waiting for the train to pass and you can hear it blowing that massive horn about a mile and a half away? 
<br />

<br />
LOL bought one. RAWR! Found a place in SC that sells them so we bought one and I just put it up on the boat last weekend! /cheers for massive noise!
<br />

<br />
Now I get to piss off ppl in marina's 2 miles away from ours, WEEEEEEEE...
<br />

<br />
Rokke, i'm afraid you'd try to blow the horn after a few rounds of tequila at 3am. 
<br />

<br />
/em continues to troll some more...
