  65 Cleric here. 
<br />
Application has been completed and sent. 
<br />

<br />
I also want to express my thanks for letting me join you and helping me with my pofire flag. 
<br />

<br />
I have been on Stromm for over a year now. I just left DL a few days ago. Its a long story (and keeps getting longer from what I hear  <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" border="0" /> ) I can provide more information if you want to discuss it privately.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for considering my application and see you in game <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />

  LOL, I've heard a couple new threads in the story since last we spoke, but I'm glad you guys are out of that situation.  Let me know if you guys need a chanter for anything.
