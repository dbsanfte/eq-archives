  <b>Post subject: </b>65 Druid Applying<hr width=95% class="sep"/>
  Hi all,
<br />

<br />
I just submitted an application to join.  I guess I am sort of a wierd case.  I am trying out EQ again after about a year from being away from the game.  I am the original player of Mytra.  Many of you will know me.  Mytra is currently listed as an alt of Sylk.
<br />

<br />
I am a 65 druid with about 133 AA abilities mainly focused on healing.  I oringally started on the Tribunal Server.
<br />

<br />
I'm looking for a nice place to log in and have fun.  Don't really care about loot.
<br />

<br />
I guess the biggest question I might anticipate is why am I returning after about a year off.  Sylk (heh I knew him as Wump) is my RL cousin.  He had been trying to get me to return back to EQ for a while now.  Apparently, you may be able to put a druid to good use.  I came in today and talked to Rifkind (she was not on her main) and she said she would sponser me.
<br />

<br />
I raided extensively on The Tribunal and often lead raids for my old guild.  My knowledge and skills will be a bit rusty - but I hopefully learn fast.  Many of you have raided with me on Trib.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, I look forward to seeing some old friends in the game.  Take care all.
<br />
