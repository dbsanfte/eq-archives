  Hello all,
<br />
Been a long time since I have been able to even access the internet, so just thought I would drop a line and see how everything is going.  I hope that everything is going well.  As for me, I am stuck in Groton, CT for a while, should be about another month or so before I can get internet access.  I will be stationed at this command for about another year or so....  As I said I hope everything is going well here and hope everyone is doing well...no one has been forgotten and I hope I havent either.  Well friends, off to do some more work so I will be in touch soon
<br />

<br />
