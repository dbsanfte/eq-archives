  <b>Post subject: </b>Hello, from Lamdon<hr width=95% class="sep"/>
  Thought I would drop by and say ploop. Glad to see you guys are still progressing. I'm progressing as well, just not in EQ. I don't even have a PC anymore, we only have Macintoshes in our house now. No time for games I guess. I'm studying to get into Vetrinary school and have to start looking for a school to get into. Perhaps after I get accepted into a Vetrinary school I'll have time to get a PC and play EQ again. I still have Lamdon so I don't have to go through levelling abck up to 65 again, at least, though I hear they are raising it again.
<br />

<br />
Anyways, I still talk too much. Have fun and stuff,
<br />
