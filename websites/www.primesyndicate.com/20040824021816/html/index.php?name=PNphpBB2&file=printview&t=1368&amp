  Doubt many of you remember me from last year.. but nice to see you guys still going. I'm Ripslash (two boxed Shaman and a Rogue but had to quit the guild because of RL because I went to Brazil). Anyway, just wanted to say hi =) and keep kickin' ass!

  Actually headed down there again the beginning of next month to get married =) so went really well.. but anyway =). Have no idea what the server is like at this point other than reading your news every couple of weeks.. but looks like you guys are doing great=) I've been in a lot of guilds.. and even for the month or so I was with PS.. it's still one of the best experiances I've had=) Keep chuggin'!
