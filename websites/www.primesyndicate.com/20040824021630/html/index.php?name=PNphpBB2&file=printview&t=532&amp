  Would appreciate it if you all would stop by and have a look!  Am starting a bit of small business with my dear sweet little old mommy.  How else is a single father to pay for his Childrens edumacation.  Would love to hear any feedback that you might have. 
<br />

<br />
Does the site tell you sufficiently what were are doing , does it not load fast enough.
<br />

<br />
something you would buy maybe, or is it a worthless Idea... 
<br />

<br />
Note: would the Web queen have any ideas for the site?????

  MSB, interesting idea, I hope it goes well for you.  Have you thought of adding an additional line aimed at scrap books?  Say something to past into the scrap book to hold pictures clipings whatever?  My Ex did a lot of scrap books, basically one for everything that went on and she was always looking for stuff to add texture to the pages.  Just my 2cp
