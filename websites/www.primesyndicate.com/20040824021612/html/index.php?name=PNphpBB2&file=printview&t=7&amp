  <span style="font-weight:bold">A bit of PS History:</span>
<br />
Prime Syndicate remains one of the oldest guilds on the Stromm server. Established May 24th, 2003 and still going strong. While other guilds have dissolved, ours has stood through the test of time. I would like to think our stability and prosperity is due to the careful selection of our members. Although no process is 100% perfect, I believe our method has had a part in our continued success.
<br />

<br />
We are also one of the few, if not only raiding guilds on the Stromm server that actually originated on Stromm. Many other guilds were already preformed on other servers and moved to Stromm with a large handful of members when the server opened. Most of us were in our mid 30s-40s when PS was first formed. It was our desire was to create a solid raiding guild with a good foundation. No Bs, No (or little) drama, No favoritism, No Attitude, No corruption, No hidden agenda heh. We just wanted to raid, enjoy the game's content, progress and have fun. 
<br />

<br />
PS provides a very healthy, enjoyable atmosphere compared to many other guilds I have been a part of. Most of us are mature, polite and good natured people, who enjoy the game and like to play hard. We try to encourage the same from others who consider joining us.
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">I want to join Prime Syndicate, where do I start?</span>
<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Be Serious and Honest </span>- Read over our <a href="http://www.primesyndicate.com/html/index.php?module=ContentExpress&amp;func=display&amp;ceid=1" target="_blank" class="postlink">Guild Charter</a> and make sure it is in line with your own goals and desires. If you want to be in Plane of Time and see the end of the game next month, if mostly what you care about is the phattest gear, we are probably not the guild for you. We will also not consider you if you are currently tagged with another guild or applying to other guilds. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Seek our and befriend our members</span> -  Ideally, you will already be well acquainted with some of our members. Try and contact people in our guild around your level and group with them. Make them aware that you are seeking admission or perhaps have already applied to the guild and would like to do as much with them as possible and to get to know the other members. Remember that joining a guild is a two-way street; as we evaluate you, you evaluate us. If some members in our guild wishes to take your admission to the next step, they will SPONSOR you. 
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sponsorship </span>- You will need a sponsor for your application to be put up for consideration. A sponsor is a full PS member of at least two months who is willing to take you under their wing, educate you and show you the basics of how  we do things.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Submit an Application</span> - You may apply without a sponsor, but will need one within one week of receipt of your application for it to be considered. In no way does having a sponsor guarantee your acceptance into the guild. Members and officers will still need to interact with you and provide feedback for final consideration.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Other requirements:</span>
<br />
Additional information and Class level requirements can be found on our <a href="http://www.primesyndicate.com/html/application.php" target="_blank" class="postlink">Guild Application</a>.  Also make sure you have read our <a href="http://www.primesyndicate.com/html/index.php?module=ContentExpress&amp;func=display&amp;ceid=1" target="_blank" class="postlink">Guild Charter</a> before you submit your application. If you have any questions that are not answered on this site,  feel free to toss me a tell in game.
<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Who should I contact?</span>
<br />
A list of contact people can be found <a href="http://www.primesyndicate.com/html/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=815" target="_blank" class="postlink">&gt;&gt; HERE &lt;&lt; </a>
