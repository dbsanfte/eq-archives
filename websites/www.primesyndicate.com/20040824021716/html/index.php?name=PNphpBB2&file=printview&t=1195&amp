  After talking with Duskin last nite we have decided to post in order to see if guild members would welcome us back.  We miss our friends.  DS made some poor decisions while being upset and after thinking things through we realize how much we like being a part of PS.  We would like to come back as trial members to see how it works out.  Hope to be raiding with you again soon.

  My apologies I was trying to copy the thread and it ended up deleting a few of the replies. I will make a copy of this thread to the internal recruit discussion forum so people can feel free to comment. I'm doing this cause I feel it is mostly an internal issue, but if you feel otherwise pls talk with me in game or send me a priv msg here. 
<br />

Thanks <img src="./modules/PNphpBB2/images/smiles/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0" />
