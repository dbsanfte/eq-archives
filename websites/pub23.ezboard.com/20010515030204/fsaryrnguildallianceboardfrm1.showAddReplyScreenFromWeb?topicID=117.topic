I have taken out some of the pointless dialogue from the guild and searched my ENTIRE log of Sunday.. and much to my bemusement i have not 1 tell from Tekkang to ME about an offer of help with CR other than this stated here by Meecham, now you read that and tell me what it says, a guild or 1 person offering to help ....<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:18:39 2001] Meecham tells you, 'Tekkang is kindly helping out where he can, he brought some coffins and stuff to try and help'<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:19:14 2001] You told meecham, 'okies, we will re-imburse him when done'<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:19:43 2001] Meecham tells you, 'aye i thought maybe we could invite him along? just a suggestion )'<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:19:51 2001] You told Meecham, 'class ?'<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:19:56 2001] Meecham tells you, 'wizzy'<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:20:07 2001] Meecham tells you, 'hes the leader of spirit guardians'<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:20:21 2001] You told Meecham, 'ok'<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:30:07 2001] Meecham tells the guild, 'Do we have any necros or SK ready to res yet? Tekkang is here with some coffins'<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:31:04 2001] You say to your guild, 'coffins no good less the person there'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:32:00 2001] You told deril, 'how many corpses at n camp atm ?'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:32:07 2001] Crumbling auctions, '100pp for gate'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:32:17 2001] Deril tells you, 'i aint there'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:32:30 2001] Deril tells you, 'almost got skruffs and falla's there though'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:32:41 2001] You told Deril, 'okies'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 17:32:56 2001] You told Deril, 'lemme know as soon as fallas is there so she can log in and res herself'<br>
<br>
SO at this point we were getting a 56 Cleric ressed asap to minimize the exp loss on people ...<br>
<br>
Next is a total script, so as to disprove the implied msg that we only ressed SG's members when Tekkang threatened to enter the Plane....<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:29 2001] Myriah tells you, 'I was told to log on'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:34 2001] You receive 1 copper from the corpse.<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:38 2001] You say, 'myriah onlne'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:42 2001] Deril tells the guild, 'gotta /q out'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:46 2001] Annihilus says, 'back'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:46 2001] Skruffs says, 'someones agroed'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:47 2001] Alvar saved.<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:49 2001] Sasala tells the guild, 'hmm wonder if the gm wasn't talking trash '<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:54 2001] Lazzor says, 'oom'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:55 2001] Tekkang tells you, 'if you dont get our members rezzed in 15 minues were coming in after them'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:56 2001] You begin casting Invisibility.<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:16:59 2001] You are low on food and drink.<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:01 2001] You vanish.<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:01 2001] Dstoir tells the guild, 'its a gm nuff said'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:08 2001] Narlid tells the guild, 'Well if I cant be rez'd then ill cry'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:09 2001] Lazzor steps into the shadows and disappears.<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:11 2001] You told Tekkang, 'who are your members please ?'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:18 2001] Tekkang tells you, 'duvane and myriah'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:20 2001] Lazzor says, '20'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:23 2001] Zlutmeister tells the guild, 'but how weird that sas is to old and mine went fine and so on seems like bugs'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:24 2001] Narlid tells the guild, 'erm well tell the truth I wont'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:31 2001] Lazzor says, 'let me get his last one then try my corpse falla'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 22:17:33 2001] You told Tekkang, 'myriahs res is incoming'<br>
<br>
As you see we were in the process of ressing Myriah when the offer/threat was made. This is to dis-prove the implication echoed that we only ressed SG's members once we were threatened with you entering the Plane, a complete falsification.<br>
<br>
As stated at the beggining of this log, i informed our member to tell Tekkang he would be re-imburssed for the coffins he used. Now i dont know if Meecham logs his files but if so, his will most likely correspond with these. <br>
<br>
What can i glean from this ?<br>
<br>
Well firstly, Tekkang did not ONCE speak to me about helping with a CR or that his guild as a whole did, now was it possible he was speaking to Alvaris , please note, ALVAR ..... AlvarIS 2 completely different people, so all i can do is ask Tekkang to scan his log files and post them here, where he sent me a tell, because after searching my log around 20 times i cannot find a single tell from Tekkang to ME other than the 1st one which was a threat to enter the plane. <br>
<br>
Now you can say it was not a threat it was an offer, well i will say thats just like my 'Hello post' was an 'Hello' not a recruitment post, remember, things can be interpreted many ways, so instead of jumping the gun and flaming people you should maybe talk to them 1st, food for thought dont you think.???<br>
<br>
Now a transcript of a converstion i had with Elektra, now it gets me to wondering why i would respond to Elektra and not Tekkang, as he states a little later he sent me a tell every 20mins, again this bemuses me how i have a record of speaking to Elektra, yet the 1st record of a conversation between Tekkang and I was his threat to enter the Plane, makes me wonder some ....<br>
<br>
<br>
[Sun Mar 25 21:38:38 2001] Elektra tells you, 'how's it going?  Tekkang is at the portal with those coffins when you're ready for some summoning'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 21:41:40 2001] You told Elektra, 'ok thanks we gonna be running people in soon'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 21:41:57 2001] Elektra tells you, 'k, Tekk's at the portal when you're ready'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 21:43:19 2001] Elektra tells you, 'can i get the password to the chat room?  one of our officers is there i need to talk to'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 21:43:28 2001] You told Elektra, 'skeleton'<br>
[Sun Mar 25 21:43:38 2001] Elektra tells you, 'thans mate'<br>
<br>
5mins total, our conversation done and dusted. All the info he wanted and all the info i needed.<br>
<br>
Now 2 and a half hours later, im logged on as another member to get his corpse out of Fear, transcript of conversation.....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[Mon Mar 26 00:20:58 2001] You told tekkang, 'Hi, this is Alvar on another char. Im sorry you felt you was ignored. We had to get coffins to summon those whos corpses were unretrievable, myself has been logging on 4-5 different players so as to get them ressed, my apologies,'<br>
[Mon Mar 26 00:21:17 2001] Tekkang tells you, 'i bought the coffins SIX hours ago'<br>
[Mon Mar 26 00:21:39 2001] Tekkang tells you, 'and had CR teams read six horus ago while you ignored me'<br>
[Mon Mar 26 00:22:11 2001] You told tekkang, 'Yes im aware of that but we needed more, we had a wipeout at the north camp, we had a CR team there. I myself was told that YOU was available to help, NOT your guild.'<br>
[Mon Mar 26 00:22:53 2001] Tekkang tells you, 'i sent you a tell telling you i had people ready'<br>
<br>
[Mon Mar 26 00:23:55 2001] You told Tekkang, 'Bro, i have had over 100 tells, if i missed your saying you had a TEAM ready to help, my apologies.  Only info i was given was that you had coffins and was available to help, i say again, NOT your guild'<br>
[Mon Mar 26 00:24:21 2001] Tekkang tells you, 'i sent you one every 20 minutes..i know a raid is crazy but you cant just not ever respond to someone'<br>
[Mon Mar 26 00:24:51 2001] You told Tekkang, 'I responded to Electra and i responded to your saying you was going to enter the Plane to get your members if we DIDNT'<br>
[Mon Mar 26 00:25:27 2001] Tekkang tells you, 'whatever man.....be uber all you want....dont worry about our guildmmebers wanting to go on your rides anymore'<br>
<br>
So, obviously Tekkang a little pissed off here and if i ignored a tell from him every 20mins, with good reason. But i stress once more and my log file is available to all and any to view, i have scanned it too many times to remember now, and the FIRST conversation i had with Tekkang, was his THREAT to enter the Plane and recover his guild-members, which just happened as Myriah was being ressed, now that makes me wonder also, why he would send that, when he would obviously KNOW she was online and online for a REASON.<br>
<br>
Now, we did not use any of the coffins Tekkang purchased  and i know he is now holding 8 coffins for no reason at all, because SGA would never suffer a wipeout of any sort now or in the future. I have stated we will re-imburse him for the coffins, which we will quite willingly, we will take the 8 coffins and refund him the cash he spent, @ 180pp per that makes 1440pp i think, not taking into account faction/charisma stats. If he contacts myself or an officer we will have a druid meet him and refund his cash ASAP.<br>
<br>
You see, the more i think of this the more it gets my back up. Now no officer is going to admit to threatening people with being unable to join our raids unless they join us the following week, why ? Because i would remoe them as an officer immediatly if i found this allegation to be true. However, why would they make such a threat? I know some of your members joined us but let me make a note here, Lorena and Raul, Kawum and Qinn, joined us BEFORE i posted an hello to your msg boards.<br>
<br>
Some of your members have since then applied to join, some have been succesfull, some have not. I am aware of a 'disagreement' between a couple of your members and an officer in Celtica. I also know allegations of K'sing were levelled against an officer at the exact same time that said officer was in Commons tunnel, the night Celtica guild was formed, now that makes me wonder also .... <br>
<br>
Now, they say people in glass-houses should not throw stones, or get undressed, so i think, before you cast dispersions against us or any other guild, you should first check and make sure your own house is in order 1st <br>
<br>
I will be making no further responses to this incident and i am still investigating these claims of strong-arm tactics to 'enroll' members, and believe you me, if i find it to be true, my own officers will suffer the consequences and i hope those from your guild will also suffer, if these allegations are found to be false....<br>
<br>
Good luck to you in both worlds ....</font><P><center><b><u><font color=#0000ff>Alvar Coldraven GL Celtica</font></u></b>

<br>
I think Alvar and company did their best on CR. I think there was a major breakdown in communication though. After three hours in the chat room I asked the people there if I should request that my guild organize a team to come in and clear north camp and help in CR. Their response was a screen full of &quot;Yes&quot;. After talking to my guild I told the people in the chatroom that my guild was coming to help. I am disappointed that Alvar or the rest of the CR team didnt get this info relayed to them. Galand(sp?) was both in the chatroom and had an account online in guildchat. It is hard to believe he missed the talk about this and didnt relay it to Alvar. I was told Alvar and Alvaris were leading the raid and passed that on to Tekkang. I am sure he talked to one or the other, infact I think he mentioned that Alvaris was in Kunark and asked how he could be on the raid. Also several members of Celtica logged into and outof the chatroom, I am surprised they didnt tell Alvar about the help coming.<br>
<br>
I think after two hours of CR and no end in sight, a guild should ask for an outside team to come in and clear part of the zone. Even if this means losing some &quot;phat lewt.&quot; I was hoping Tekkang would put together a crew to do just that. None of us likes to enter a plane when another guild is doing a raid, but unfortunately this lead to a twelve hour CR. I fully believe Tekkang and crew could have came in and shortened CR by several hours. So lets try to set up some sort of aggreement between the guilds about helping with wipe-outs. Maybe we can all learn something from this.<br>
<br>
I would like to say that Alvar, Alvaris, Falla, Deril, and Celtica as a whole has always treated me with kindness and fairness. I am not mad at anyone about the &quot;Fear Fiasco.&quot;<br>
<br>
Please lets stop accusing people of things and start to rebuild a good relationship between the various guilds.<br>
