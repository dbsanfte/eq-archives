No thanks.  See above.  It's funny though that you mention that.  Someone in my guild this week levelled a magician (I know, not the same thing - but still a caster based largely on mana) from 1-52 in a week.  Sure, he was twinked.  But it happened.  Just something neat.<br>

I can't go into any neewbie area now days and find someone NOT tweaked.  Ok I'm exaggerating a little.<br>
<br>
My point is on my server it seems most everyone at the lower levels is tweaked out in some way.  Yes even the wizards.  I occasionally find someone not tweaked out in a newbee area and when I do, guess what, I tweak them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .  When ever I find bronze fine steel or velium armor or weapons or anything I can't sell for 150pp or more I literally give it away to the first untweaked character I can find.  what's the use of selling a fine steel weapon for 3pp when a level 5 ranger in Kelethin can make good use of it?  <br>
<br>
So yes my friends I'm personally adding to the tweaking problem on my server.  <br>
<br>
Heck, I hate auctioning stuff it's boring.  By the time I get to level 54  or so, and I'm getting decent loot worth something, I may actually occasionally give some of it away for free also.  There are a few others on my server like this also.  I see people giving decent mid to lower mid level stuff away for free all the time on my server.  Always random and NEVER to beggars.<br>

&quot;Melees are generating all that aggro, you only have to stay below&quot; or some such - aggro is an INDIVIDUAL thing, it's not like all those melees add up into one huge aggro ball....if you pass the front melee in aggro, you will get stomped....it's a skill to avoid that <p>Remfin<BR>

Hrm.  If I only died once per level in my 20's, I'd be one lucky mofo.<br>

Go back and play the game.  It's changed.  And you call US ignorant.  Yeesh!<br>

&quot;well, guess how many 49+ clerics there were.. yeah, thats right. Zero. Count all that lost exp. I'd imagine most today get some type of res every death.&quot;<br>
Hrm.  The last time I got a rez was.... level 12 from a bored passerby?  D'oh!  And no, I'm not a dummie-wizzie. =)  But since I don't agree with you, I must be.  /gasp<br>
<br>
&quot;Wizards have it easier now.<br>
Repeat:  Go back and play one.  When was the last time you went 1-50?<br>
<br>
&quot; And why is this relevant to the argument that it's harder now to level a wizard? Just because it's easy to make a_melee_twink99, doesn't mean it's harder to level a wizard. I think that's where you're getting confused.&quot;<br>
This falls under something they call &quot;class balancing.&quot;  Let's say the wizzie of today wasn't any harder to level.  If your warrior counter-parts level 10x faster than you, doesn't that make the game suck?  That's why they call it &quot;unbalanced.&quot;  If you don't care, fine, but don't call those who do &quot;ignorant.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; No thanks. See above. It's funny though that you mention that. Someone in my guild this week levelled a magician (I know, not the same thing - but still a caster based largely on mana) from 1-52 in a week. Sure, he was twinked. But it happened. Just something neat.&quot;<br>
<br>
You're even bringing this up, so I'll assume you don't know.  Mages are MUCH easier to play sub-50 than wizzies.  In your ignorance (ironic, eh?), you wouldn't know that. =)  Mages nuke very much similar to wizzies, but have a pet, thus are much easier to play.  They do more damage, and can gate unless they're in WAY over their heads.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't know everything about this game.  I speculate from what others say, and generally, I make a point of that in my posts: I let people know I just might not know what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
You, on the other hand, seem to love to speculate about Mages vs Wizzies, and wizzies in general, sub-50, when you refuse to even touch a wizzie sub-50.<br>
<br>
You think we're ignorant because we can't &quot;inferr&quot; your conclusions from HARD EXPERIENCE, not just what we hear.  I'm going to be bold and call you ignorant because you refuse to experience it; instead, you like to guess because you hear things about sub-50's.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guess I'm ignorant now, I don't agree.<br>
