We had 13 players on the raid.  6 players I did not get meaningful damage data from because they were either casters or support classes (2 clerics, 1 ench, 1 druid, 1 wiz (lvl 55) and 1 necro).<br><br>The core of the logs (from when entire group was assembled until we reached Yael) was for a 50 minute stretch.  We were in combat almost exactly half of that time (total log duration was 3049 seconds, combat data covers 1447 seconds).  Most of the rest of the time we were moving or waiting on pulls.  To be honest, it seemed like an awful lot less than 25 minutes of downtime.<br><br>Conditions were optimal for me to be maximally effective in damage over time.  I used my rend robe once in most fights, and used manastone/epic to regen mana.  For the tougher mobs (golems) I would open with a robe nuke (784 dmg) and follow it up immediately with a sunstrike or two.  I drew agro many times at the very end of fights when sunstrike landed, but seldom had my BoF fall.  We killed a total of 66 mobs in those 66 minutes.  Log data for others is conservative, as I likely was out of log range for a small amount of the time.  I would guess that the log data is at least 90-95% of the actual damage produced by the others.<br><br>The raw numbers (level, class, total damage, dmg/sec (in combat), dmg/sec (total))<br>60 wiz 83397 ... 55.60 ... 27.35<br>58 rog 68397 ... 45.54 ... 22.4<br>59 war 65719 ... 43.81 ... 21.55<br>60 pal 64211 ... 42.81 ... 21.06<br>60 pal 47547 ... 31.70 ... 15.59<br>60 brd 36047 ... 24.03 ... 11.83<br>54 SK 26622 ... 17.75 ... 8.73<br><br>So I was able to do about 22% more damage than a well equipped rogue (epic but not NtoV nor ST level weapons).

Assume an average of 12 manastone uses for each stone/epic cycle; and that each cycle would take about 18 seconds, and we get 3 med ticks (or 72 mana) for each cycle (344/12 = about 2<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ... 72x28 = 2016 mana from meditate. Add mana for meditation instead of rend casts (2 per rend robe use) gives another 1776 mana. This would mean having 16605 mana available (or 84.3% of actual). Pro-rating SS and draught of jiva damage, we end up with 12760 dmg from draught of jiva, and 41021 from sunstrike, or 53781 total damage. Here's the adjusted damage sheet:<br><br>60 wiz 53781 ... 37.17 ... 17.63 (no rend robe, no manastone, with bard)<br><br>... or between the paladins on the damage output.<br><br>These numbers are all theorhetical, but are interesting nonetheless. Without added damage from me, most battles would have lasted a little bit longer, so that skews all results by a bit. Of most interest to me is the comparison to the 59 warrior (who does not have primal equipment). The paladins and bard have primal equipment.<br><br>One of the most interesting things that had not occured to me until this second round of analysis is how much mana the bard's song added to my pool. I don't usually have the luxury of a bard song, and it alone probably accounted for roughly 6098 mana or 19757 dmg (roughly what I got from rend robe). For this calculation I'm using 12 mana/tic from bard song to account for time where bard song was not active.<br><br>Factoring this in we get:<br><br>60 wiz 34023 ... 23.51 ... 11.16 (no rend robe, no manastone, no bard)<br><br>... or right below the bard.

This was a two group setup, and we were pulling drakes to the entrance.  Mob level range was 60-63.  Some had a weak AE attack.  We spent some time between each pull waiting for clerics to regen mana, and a bit of time waiting for repops. We were there for an hour and 50 minutes and killed 14 mobs. We had no druids, rangers, or necros, and the SK was a whiner, so I was on snare duty.<br><br>Our group was composed of me (wiz), 2 clerics, 1 shaman, 1 enchanter, 3 warriors, 1 monk, 1 SK, and 1 rogue.  The rogue was level 58, all others were level 60.<br><br>For all but the glimmer drakes, I cast Atol's for snare, then used a combination of rend robe, sunstrike, and icy spear for damage dealing.  For glimmer drakes (which are highly magic resistant), I cast icy spear and lure of ice.  The only time I came close to running low on mana was when on full burn against glimmer drakes. I only drew agro once over the night, and that was because of a series of resisted snares. I cast concussion liberally to avoid agro in other situations.<br><br>We were parked in ToV for 6702 seconds (counting from first pull to death of final mob), but we were actually fighting for only 2343 seconds. Average pull was a solo pull, and each fight lasted around 2 and a half minutes.<br><br>Standard disclaimers:  Log does not show spell damage done by others, nor proc damage. I undoubtedly missed some melee damage done by the tanks because of range, but log should be very close.  There was only one death over the course of the night, and that came to the main tank before we managed to get the enchanter to join us for haste.<br><br>Player ... total ... dmg/sec ... total dmg/sec<br>58 rog ... 117527 ... 50.16 ... 17.54<br>60 mnk ... 117172 ... 50.01 ... 17.48<br>60 war ... 106174 ... 45.32 ... 15.84 (defx6, offx1)<br>60 war ... 102971 ... 43.95 ... 15.36 (defx2)<br>60 shd .... 93209 ... 39.78 ... 13.91<br>60 war .... 85110 ... 36.33 ... 12.70 (defx6)<br>60 wiz .... 81109 ... 34.62 ... 12.10 (*me*)<br><br>Observations:<br>My damage in this situation was primarily limited by agro. The agro I generated by casting snare meant that nuking hard would have quickly turned me into paste.  I find it interesting to note that using our utility spells automatically reduces our damage output, which is a fact that hadn't occured to me before. This reduces the value of the spell when used as a factor when comparing damage output imo. Snare was resisted more than half the time, so I also spent a lot of time and mana fulfilling this role.<br><br>I was curious how my damage compared on a fuller burn, so I parsed one of the glimmer drakes seperately:<br><br>58 rog ... 8353 ... 42<br>60 mnk ... 7820 ... 39<br>60 wiz ... 6975 ... 35 (*me*)<br>60 shd ... 6618 ... 33 (drew agro a lot)<br>60 war ... 5805 ... 29<br>60 war ... 4362 ... 22 (def)<br>60 war ... 3692 ... 18<br><br>Glimmers have a high defense, so number are generally on the low side.

I've also done some on paper analysis to provide some additional wizard specific data (I should write my own parser for this stuff though)... There were 5 of us: 60 wiz (me), 60 SK, 60 war, 60 enchanter, and 54 shaman. Since the shaman was doing heals as well as slows, we went a bit slower than we would have with a cleric. Our total time from first fight to last was 1:37:01, though we were actually in combat for only 33 minutes, or roughly 1/3 of the time. I was on snare duty, so I nuked less than I otherwise would have. I used my rend robe extensively to contribute more damage.<br><br>Since this was a single group, my damage numbers for others is more accurate than it has been for raid settings.

I should note that damage output in this situation was limited more by agro than mana (concussion casts rather than nukes when I drew agro).

For the third part (2nd King spawn) as well as the trip down, I did not use my rend robe at all (to get some data points for that). I was on snare duty for this entire session.

I went from an average mana pool of 60m at the beginning to an average of 20m at the end. As a result, the numbers are skewed a bit higher.<br>- This was pretty much a constant pull environment. We didn't have any &quot;down time&quot; where we were waiting for anyone to get mana. In my experience, &quot;constant pulls&quot; translates into actual fights occupying half of the time, though it feels like a lot more (see my Hole raid log for another data point on this). Groups with meditation down time tend to be more 1/3 fighting and 2/3 down time.<br>- The 60 rogue made the comment that evade was too effective. He really did not take much damage at all, and the monk was the main tank. Not counting pull damage taken, the damage breakdown was roughly:<br>60 mnk -- 50% dmg taken<br>60 chnt -- 25% dmg taken<br>58 shm -- 10% dmg taken<br>60 rog -- 10% dmg taken<br>others -- 5%<br>- I haven't calculated out my spell breakdown.

The main problem is that for me to gather data myself, I'd need to put myself in range of the AE for the entire fight. I've asked others to take a log, but they cannot get good data on other's hits because the range from target is so high. However, I did manage to get a damage log from a friend of mine who captured only his hits. As a level 60 warrior, he's appeared in many of my logs in the past, though he doesn't have primal, he has decent weapons and does very good damage. The fight lasted 17:48. I also asked several of our wizards how they did, and so here are the results:<br><br>(level class ... damage ... dmg/sec)<br>60 war ... 12066 ... 11.30<br>60 wiz ... 40000 ... 37.45 (me -- 2 harvests, 4 mod rods, and a bit of medding)<br>60 wiz ... 44000 ... 41.20 (used epic/manarobe)<br>60 wiz ... 58096 ... 54.40 (this well known Triton wizard added a bit of melee damage, and apparently pulled mana out of his ass)<br><br>It is also interesting to note that the 60 warrior survived the entire fight, but took 17000 dmg from AE. Assuming 3 complete heals to keep him propped up, his damage contribution cost a total of 1200 cleric mana. I was fortunate and/or skillful this fight, and avoided the AE entirely.<br><br>I would guess that a primal equipped rogue would do approximately double the damage of the warrior (judging from earlier logs and extrapolating). Someday I might get some data on this, and I'll post what I find.<br><br>- Armok Komra &lt;Triton&gt;<br>Sorcerer of Povar <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaniar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aniar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.docsmooth.com/images/dot.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/12/01 8:04:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=603.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.docsmooth.com/images/me.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Parsers</span><hr size=1> I'm working on it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I've still got to play EQ and work full-time though. hehe.<br><br>What I've got:<br>A program that right now parses caster stuff, but will do melee (it took me a week to figure out how to filter out falling damage from casting damage consistently) - but only does the math - my interfaces suck, so I'll be happy to email my crap-code VB6 and send it to anyone interested in helping, when I've got a little more sense in it.<br><br>The idea is to do most of what the parser from mpog.net does, but to do casting damage correctly.

I tried to edit out as much of the commentary as I could.<br><br>=======<br><br>This log was taken July 28, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   2000</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  In other words, this log was taken over a year ago, well before velious but after kunark had been released.  It is a log of a 2 hour and 45 minute session in the courtyard and maze of Cazic Thule.  The initial group was a 25 warrior, 24 shadowknight, 27 Cleric, 25 Cleric, 25 Enchanter, and myself, a 22/23 magician.  After seeing the data and looking back over the log, I discovered that the 25 warrior and 27 cleric both left an hour and a half into the session.  I parsed the first half of the session separately, in addition to the entire log, and that data is listed second.<br><br>This was my first real experience in a 6-man dungeon group. However, I think this is a decent example of what a normal dungeon group would have been like back before velious.  The warrior had an Executioners Axe, I don't know what anyone else was using.  <br><br>All the pets were mine.  Log data seems to indicate that all pets were killed by mobs except for one, which was likely killed by me on purpose. <br><br>This log does not include any effects from pet procs, however, I was not using pets that had a damaging proc.  Gebarab was an air pet(stun proc), all other pets were earth pets(root proc).<br><br>I calculated the time spent in combat by measuring the distance between melee hits, and counting anything longer than 20 seconds as downtime.  This has the obvious flaw of the fact that the log did not include misses, so if a melee went more than 20 seconds without hitting at all, then the parse is erroneous.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Damage</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br><br>(lvlcls ... damage ... av. dps combat ... dps overall) - This is still overall, so might seem wierd because the group changed halfway.<br>25 War ... 14,815 ... 9.37 ... 2.69 (~29% in combat)<br>23 Mag ... 12,698 ... 5.30 ... 1.30 (~24% in combat - based on the 24 SK)<br>24 Shd ... 11,153 ... 4.66 ... 1.13 (~24% in combat)<br>25 Clr ... 5,060 ... 2.96 ... 0.52 (~17% in combat)<br><br>Breakdown of mage damage: pets(3122) + nukes(8603) + damage shields(945) + melee(28) <br><br>(With pets listed separately)<br>Note:<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Overall damage per second from the pets might look high, because I stopped counting time for a pet after it died.
