I play a warrior and a wizzie on Rallos Zek. My warrior is into his 50's, and all of you saying that the 66% cap should be removed to &quot;give casters a chance&quot; is an absolute joke to anyone who has played a melee anywhere past level 20 on PvP. Like i said, i also have a wiz of a decent level, so im not ignorant to the class. <br><br>If someone could tell me exactly where this huge &quot;melee advantage&quot; is, i would really appreciate it because it would help my day to day play. <br><br>Lets set up this scenario. My Troll self is banking in Neriak. Gosh, it sure is hard to move around in there... all the little inkies blocking my way. Suddenly I'm hit by Ice Comet. There goes a quarter of my life. Roughly 15 seconds later I'm dead. I never saw where he was casting from. I had NO chance to fight back in the least, and I couldn't even get out of the bank for the little Tier'Dal asking me if i could spare some money for their level 4 spells. This happens constantly on RZ. Not just to warriors. All it takes for a wizard to drop someone cold is for them to have a target and a predisposed victim. Thats all there is to it. It takes about 4 ICs to drop me. How many would it take to drop your wiz? Especially if say, you already have something targeted. If you even hope to fight back you have to take the first IC, empty your target, take the second IC, hope it doesnt kill you, track down the offending wizard in his hiding place and somehow do the damage that he has done to you in that time. Remove the damage cap? you wouldnt even have a chance to get a target. Thats the simple truth. <br><br>Lets not mention that all it takes to cancel out my melee is a diamond skin and levi. And casters are at a disadvantage? <br><br>Make every spell in PvP line of sight, then we'll talk about the logic of removing the cap. <br><br>Log onto RZ one night. Ask around and get the names of a few PvP guilds. Talk to an officer, ask how many tanks they have over level 50 in their guild, and listen to them laugh at you. Yeah, as a warrior i have enough HP to get my dropables bagged, but there really isnt any fight. <br><br>In a face to face duel, it would be a good fight. Ive beaten wizards in friendly duels. Ive also been beaten. Its pretty even in that aspect. <br><br>You complain around enough and get the &quot;outdated&quot; damage cap removed, and you've ruined 3 servers (Sullon doesnt count).<br><br>I love PvP. Thats why im on Rallos... the most PvP of PvP. Ive rambled a bit, and i dont mean to seem so argumentative. Its just that ive played on this server since a few weeks after it went live. I know how PvP works, and ive played almost every class. Casters, especially wizards, have an advantage. Is it an unfair advantage? No. But in my opinion its completely incorrect to say that you're at some crippling disadvantage that needs to be addressed.<br><br>I would be more than happy to answer any questions that some of you may be curious about. My mind is made on the subject, but that doesnt mean it cant be changed. Do you have any suggestions on how things could be done to make melee and caster alike happy? <br><br>Vorashus Ratsnatcher<br>       Champion <br> &lt;Disciple of Hate&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uzerahgarden.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zerah Garden</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/23/01 5:19:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whats the purpose of the 66% nerf</span><hr size=1> &quot;...

If you just stand there bagging while a wiz nukes you, of course you're going to die. Just like if a wizard stands there and bags while you slash at him, he will die. Also, there are gear and items which will make you *much* more successful as a warrior in taking down casters.<br><br>1) Resist gear/BD jewelry - buy some of this and get your CR up to 130+. Then it will take a lot more than 4 ice comets to kill you. Even better, get a fungi tunic to go along with it and just sit there and laugh as a wizard runs OOM trying to nuke you. Then while he's medding back up you can just sit down and regen 20+ HP a tick, faster than he can med to do more damage. Sure you might feel it risky to lose items like this, but if you get a good set of gear and play it right, you'll hardly ever lose.<br><br>2) Golem wands - dropped in Cazic Thule.

Im not saying that wizards are overpowered by any means. Im saying that they are the best PvP/PK class period, until you get right around level 60 when there are a few classes they have trouble taking down (e.g. Shadowknights).<br><br>I believe you misunderstood me when i mentioned bagging. I have 3 items that are not no drop which i normally wear on my warrior. This takes all of 5 seconds to get bagged as im running after said wizard. The problem therein is when said wizard is hiding somewhere. Everyone knows that the worst possible PvP strat is to stand there bagging and do nothing else. <br><br>My resists could use some working on. My MR runs around 110, the rest between 60 and 80. Heres the thing: I would love some BD bracers, and a Fungi tunic.... but when would i wear em? When im tanking in Seb? I think not. I would get eaten alive with the hit i would take in AC. Should i wear em when im walking around in towns? Why risk it when i can just as easily wear straight no drop with resists and not have to worry about it? The gear youre talking about is hugely situational for a warrior. Whats worse than just standing there taking gear off while youre getting pounded? Standing there rummaging through your packs trying to put gear on. <br><br>Lemme clear something else up. I have beaten wizard 'gankers' many times. Its luck and skill. Get hit with the first big DD and hope you can chase em down soon enough. Like i said, it's a pretty fair fight. But how many times have i killed a wizard? Once, maybe twice. You always have the option to shadowstep/yonder and gate. Most wizards will do this as soon as you get through their diamondskin or equivilant. <br><br>We have gotten a bit off topic though. This thread and my original post was about the 66% damage cap on spells. You told me ways that i could prepare myself for an encounter with a wizard and how i should improve my PvP. Im happy with my PvP skills. My first post also wasn't complaining for a wizard nerf. I think that wizards should be the most dominating class, which they are. But they arent unbalancing. If you remove the 66% cap, I can live with it. Not happily, but i can live with it. Itll be the doom of casters though. A 49 wiz with IC will one-shot just about every caster class in his range below his level. <br><br>It may be a bit outdated, but not hugely so. Limiting melee damage in PvP could work, but it wouldnt really fix the things that people are unhappy about in PvP. The best idea that I see is a retooling of how resistances work. On spells in PvP, get an automatic bonus to your resistance check, maybe like 133%, and then let spells do full damage. Any other ideas?<br><br>Vorashus Ratsnatcher<br>Champion<br>&lt;Disciple of Hate&gt; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uneyfearsthe2nd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neyfears The2nd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/25/01 9:40:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whats the purpose of the 66% nerf</span><hr size=1> Honestly...I know your perception is innaccurate..yes on a server where you have to &quot;bag your gear&quot;  things are slightly different, but on most servers..PvP is extremely unbalanced from a wizards perspective.  <br><br>You say wizards have the advantage in an Ideal setting where the wizard gets the element of surprise...so do almost ALL classes.

Two reasons really IMO:<br><br>1) Melees. Now that their unbuffed HP is so high and their resists are high enough to partially resist any normal DD, there really is no reason for the 66% nerf.<br><br>2) Healers. A druid/shaman with chloroblast can out-heal lure spells with chloroblast and at half the mana cost and a lower cast time. Obviously Clerics with Remedy are even worse and I won't even get into Torpor (thank god for golem wands / egg shaped pumice to dispell it). With resist gear, Draughts won't do full damage anyway, and since there is no simple solution to 66% heals in PvP, the damage nerf really does need to be removed.<br><br>I think back in the item loot days when casters ran around wielding only a Slime Crystal Staff and a Stein of Moggok and melees only wielding weapons and no armor, it was balanced. Spells almost always landed for full, root and stun were viable possibilities and made the Wizard class much more well-rounded in PvP. Because most nukes landed for full because few people wore resist gear for fear of it being taken from them if they die, reducing spell damage to 66% damage just helped to even the playing field a bit.

If thats the case then just have lures do 100% i think thats more than fair and would make them at least a little more plausible in pvp encounters. overall i dont see any reason why SS at 60 shouldnt have the chance to do 1600 to a PC. That puts wizards right around where they need to be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uorocular.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Orocular</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.facelink.com/OrocularGoodheart" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/16/01 3:58:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/OrocularGoodheart?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whats the purpose of the 66% nerf</span><hr size=1> I must say after reading this thread fairly decently, there is one thing I have to say. To the warrior that is defending your actions of not wanting the damage cap removed, you suck as a warrior. Your gear is mid level. But, most importantly, how did you get to post 50? Sorry, but if your afraid of a wizard that has less than 1k HP without buffs on, at level 60 (You have a high stamina if you have 1k+ at 60 with no buffs). Sorry, but our best HP buff only gives us 230 HP. So, thats 1230 HP... buffed. A post 50 warrior can do that damage inside 5 melee rounds. If he can't, there is something hugely wrong with that. What you are talking about is ethics. Ethics are completely different than what good strategies are. And yes, if I were doing PvP, my ally is the element of surprise... your ambushed. I guess you should question my ethics too. Especially against a warrior or rogue or monk. <p><center><img SRC="http://www.pcsonline.com/users/boon/orocular.jpg" NOSAVE height=240 width=355><br><b><font color="#663366"><a href="mailto:Orocular@keepersofoak.org">Orocular - Channeler of Quellious</a></font></b><br><b><font color="#663366">Servant of the Wyrd</font></b><br><b><font color="#663366">Walker of The Way</font></b><br><b><font color="#663366">"Sure thing..."</font></b><br><b><font color="#663366">Keepers of Oak</font></b></center><br><center><b><font color="#663366">The Rathe</font></b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umachairatb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MachairaTB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/21/01 2:44:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whats the purpose of the 66% nerf</span><hr size=1> I dropped sunstrike on an unbuffed enchanter with full life and killed him with that one shot.
