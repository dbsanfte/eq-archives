Grimstaff has a point.<br>
<br>
Al'kabor spells suck.<br>
<br>
But, that wasn't news.  =)<br>
<br>
How do you fix them?  I mean, if you just tweak them so their ratio beats out columns on 5 mobs, the'll end up being used for penta-kiting, and almost nothing else.<br>
<br>
You could prevent that pretty easily by using the &quot;half damage on moving mobs&quot; solution, double their current damage, and maybe up the max targets to 6?<br>
<br>
Rains are less of a problem to fix.<br>
<br>
They have massively strignent requirements: wizard/mob placement, they stop doing damage on aggro, require lots of time to do their damage, and have annoying resistance problems.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm guessing that there are people here who have looked at these spells before alot more than me.  Given that caster balancing is going on, isn't this a good time to have a thread talking about this sort of thing?<br>

They have too low damage for the mana to actually get xps using them but without a target maximum they would be able to deal with trains and huge numbers of greens, giving them a use.<br>
<br>
Here's how I'd fix AE Rain spells: Beyond the idiotic &quot;can't kill with the last wave&quot; problem, there's two options.<br>
<br>
The first is my personal favorite, lower the damage slightly post 50 and make them hit with up to 3 waves on up to 4 targets, instead up 4 waves period.  This would require Verant putting more potent blasts at lower level in the 50s to make up for the gap that AE Rains are used to fill.  This would make them all viable AE spells.<br>
<br>
The second is less desired but useful, raise the damage of lower level rains and turn them ALL into single target blasts that act somewhat like a DOT.  Each one has to do at least 1.5 times the damage of the best blast that level, assuming all waves hit for full, to be useful for this.  This would require Verant putting more AE spells in to fill the gaps caused by rains not being there any more (the way they are built now they are barely useful as AE spells in any case).<br>
<br>
Reducing the graphics lag they cause would be another good idea. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usiryakk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Yakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/3/02 3:06:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=722.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Target cap</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The first is my personal favorite, lower the damage slightly post 50 and make them hit with up to 3 waves on up to 4 targets, instead up 4 waves period.

Lowering the damage would help.<br>
<br>
The more potent blasts are to replace the use of rain spells as single target nukes, right?<br>

Silly.  Look for exploits, always.<br>
<br>
Can you kill 1 XP bearing mob using al'kabor?  Then, with that design, you can kill 50 XP bearing mobs using al'kabor.<br>
<br>
It would take a godly manapool, or good mana regen, but... it scales poorly.  You say you can't get XP with it?  feh.<br>
<br>
For example: hand-off kiting.  Get 2 wizards.  One al'kabor kites the 50 mobs until he runs lom.  He then zones as the other one starts kiting the 50 mobs.<br>
<br>
The first one zones back.<br>
<br>
Voila, 25 mobs worth of XP for each wizard.<br>
<br>
Get a larger zone.  Grab 100 mobs.<br>
<br>
50 mobs worth of XP for each wizard.<br>
<br>
AE grouping is sort of balanced, due to the risks of being in melee range, and it requireing 1 or 2 full groups to pull off.<br>
<br>
Because mobs in EQ don't take up space, any infinite-target spell is extremely dangerous.<br>

Then, with that design, you can kill 50 XP bearing mobs using al'kabor.&quot;<br>
<br>
No.  Go ahead and try without running out of mana, go to any spot and fight any monster, do your damnest using kiting rooting, just blasting, have people keep it stuck, do anything you want.  It won't work, you can't get xps with these crapfest spells.  You know why?  The damage is too low and the mana cost it too high plus the recast time is very long; if you were very conversant with these spells you'd know how true this is.  See, if you could use Al'Kabor spells to kill monsters for xps people WOULD ALREADY DO IT because you can kill 5 with it instead of 4 and don't need to bunch them as tightly (the area is bigger).  They don't, for good reason.<br>
<br>
As a simple example:<br>
<br>
Inferno of Al'Kabor (level 53)<br>
Damage 750 (L53) to 800 (L58 )  <br>
Range to Target: 200 feet<br>
Area Effect Range: 35 feet<br>
Mana Required: 625<br>
Casting Time: 5.0 seconds<br>
Spell Recovery: 2.50 seconds<br>
Recast Delay: 9.0 seconds<br>
<br>
Damage per mana, base: 1.2<br>
Damage per mana, max: 1.28<br>
Damage per second, base: 50.0<br>
Damage per second, max: 57.14<br>
<br>
Pillar of Frost (level 51)<br>
Damage 755 (L51) to 800 (L60)<br>
Mana Required: 325<br>
Casting Time: 4.50 seconds<br>
Spell Recovery: 2.50 seconds<br>
Recast Delay: 6.0 seconds<br>
<br>
Damage per mana, base: 2.3<br>
Damage per mana, max: 2.46<br>
Damage per second, base: 71.9<br>
Damage per second, max: 76.19<br>
<br>
Al'Kabor spells use almost twice as much mana, take longer to cast, longer to recast, do less damage, and that's for a spell three levels higher or more.  They really, honestly are that awful.<br>
<br>
Some more numbers: Mana total at level 53 for Wizard at 255 INT: around 3000, plus some gear (lets say 3500).<br>
<br>
AlKabor Damage with this mana: 3750 damage.  Go ahead at level 53 and find a monster that <br>
1) give you any xps<br>
2) stays at range for you to use Al'Kabor on (i.e. you can kill using an AE spell)<br>
3) comes in swarms of over 5<br>
4) has fewer than 4000 hps and doesn't regen fast enough to make a difference between the 9 second blasts<br>
<br>
Incidentally, the post 50 Al'Kabor spells aren't as godawful as the lower level ones either.  They are still crap but not AS crappy.<br>
<br>
Feel free to show how this would be abused again.<br>

Given the area radius on these spells, they're also dangerous to use--distance is tougher to judge than with Pillar and Rain. <br>
<br>
Thing is, we'll never see this type of encounter, given the way the game works, and if we do, it'll be like the ring wars--where it's more efficient to burn down one mob than it is to hurt all of them.<br>
<br>
At least Pilar's are good for quadding and, occasionally, for a ghetto xp group if you can get the melees to split.  But then it's only because of the insane mana effieciency that beats out Draught once you get to even two targets.<br>
<br>
Al'Kabor's?  No.<br>
<br>
As for rains, they're not hard to use, really, I've been using them in XP groups / raids since 55 or so.  If even two waves hit (which they usually do, in my experience) its more efficient than draught and at least seems to draw less aggro.  If you're worried about a mob wandering out of the rain and over to you, stand at the edge of the rain.  They'll still get hit.<br>
<br>
Yeah, the resists could use some reducing, and I'd like it to hit more, but the post-50 rains really aren't a problem anymore, imo.<br>

<br>
2 wizards could.  Hand-off kiting (kite to near oom, zone/abscond/camp, other wizard kites to oom/mob death, first wizard finishes).<br>
<br>
That brings the HP threshold up to 7500 HPs+.  Oh look, same threshold as pillar spells.  But, instead of 4 mobs at a time, you have (SPAWN_POINTS/2) mobs at a time.<br>

2 wizards could quad every wyvern in CS.  Every single last one of them.  At once.  This scales poorly.<br>

That is why infinite target spells are nearly unbalanceable.<br>

<br>
Add a 0 time mez to al'kabor spells.  This will prevent them from ever breaking mez (won't land on a mez'd target).<br>

And yes, Grim, it is hard.  But, the limiting factor on a wizards XP with a infinite-target ranged spell is the number of spawn points of non casters in a zone.<br>

The spell you proposed would be useful in killing trains of greens, yes.  But my point is it would also be useful for mega-kiting.  And why do you want a spell good for killing trains of greens?  You already have PBAOEs.  I don't think Verant implementing that spell would be worth the risk.<br>

<br>
No, Hypothetical stuff like that is the point of thinking about spell ideas.  I mean, I'll admit that your spell will not cause any imbalance in how people currently play the game.  If you cast your spell instead of a spell you would right now, but didn't change your gameplay in ANY other way, there would be no problem.<br>
<br>
But players ADAPT.  They look at spells, min max, and try to set up ways to maximize their own advantage.  If you outlaw the hypothetical, your spells will not handle adapting players at all.<br>

<br>
Actually, bard charm (at that level) eats mana.  Bards regain mana at 1 mana per tick, no matter what (maybe 2 sitting).  The bard would run out of mana by the time they killed too many raptors, I'd think.  The rate of killing raptors is limited by the bards mana regen, and the requirement that a PC-controlled entity does half the damage to sub-56 mobs in order for XP/loot to occur.<br>
<br>

Or maybe it doesn't work?<br>

If you are going to change spells, beyond just tweaking numbers, you HAVE to think up bizarre scenarios.  Why?  Because imbalance often happens in the land of the bizaare.<br>

Thus, you can find a loophole in anything, no matter what, and pretend this is a major problem.  I can 100% guarantee nobody would EVER EVER end up kiting more than 5 monsters at once no matter how careful lucky and incredibly rare this ended up being.  It's way too much risk, way too much trouble, and I again suggest you look at how much mana it would cost to snare every one of those monsters you seem to believe people will have not only opportunity but desire to kite en masse. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usiryakk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sir Yakk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/7/02 1:10:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=722.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> I just realized something:  With decent coordination, you don't have to gate to clear aggro -- al'kabors have a large enough radius to let 2 people who work HARD at it both nuke.<br>
<br>
It would, admittedly, take coordination.  But I doubt it would be beyond a pair of good players.<br>
<br>
So, they both go and aggro some mobs.  And they both start snareing.  Does the L 51 snare have a target limit?  Anyone know for sure?<br>
<br>
Lets assume a limit of 4.  And, half of all snares are wasted.<br>
<br>
So, thats 75 mana per mob, pretty generous with wasted snares.<br>
<br>
Conservative: 75 * Mob_Count + Max_mob_Hps<br>
to<br>
Generous: 25 * Mob_Count + Max_mob_Hps * .8<br>
<br>
Wyverns have about 3200 HPs, and are blue at 52, most light blue at 54 (half xp).<br>
<br>
Two wizards could do... 37 of the suckers at L 53, with 3 k mana each, or so.  Half of the mana used is on snares, conservatively.  Generously, 133 of them.  Both of these numbers are limited by the number of spawn points.<br>
<br>
Ok, lets get really busy.  3 wizards, 5000 hp mobs.  53 of them.  4 wizards, 93 mobs.  Using conservative numbers.<br>
<br>
Using generous numbers, 3 can do 193, 2 can do 73.<br>
<br>
These numbers look ridiculous.  And they are.  I don't expect 3 wizards to kill 193 mobs at once.  I don't expect 4 wizards to be able to kite in syncro.  But, people WILL try this sort of thing.  And Verant would have to test the hell of of it before releasing it.  They would have to get good kiters, train them in new tactics, and see if it was possible to kill 100 mobs from range in some of the new huge outdoor zones.<br>
<br>
Personally, I think there would be wizards good enough to pull it off.  Hell, you could even try it for a lark -- penta kite 5 mobs with a wizard friend.  XP will be worse than quadding, but it might help in balancing your idea.<br>
<br>
Your change does have the advantage of turning quad kiting into a small group activity (large groups require WAY to much coordination).  A group of JUST wizards.<br>

<br>
Its not easy even getting 4 targets in Cobolt scar, the whole &quot;get all the wyverns at once&quot; thing is absurd.  I challenge you to come up with a zone with not only kitable area and xp granting monsters, but enough spawns to actually do more than 5 at once.  And remember, Atols only lasts a given duration (the max is 4, I guarantee you), and it will wear off as you go along... you have to keep ALL of them snared at once, resnaring time means others will start to break.  You really are in a bad way if you try to do more than even 5, assuming you could get that many.  Also remember that Al'Kabor casts 50% slower than pillar spells overall. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 5/12/02 11:11:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaniar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aniar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.docsmooth.com/images/dot.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/10/02 10:53:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=722.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.totalnetsolutions.net/nightwatch/images/head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Grim's hitting a point that everyone else seems to be missing in all of this - Al'Kabor's spells cast 2x as long as pillars do.  Even snared mobs will catch up to you before you finish casting, making kiting near, if not completely, impossible.<br>
<br>
Add to taht the difficulty of getting enough mobs to make this possible.<br>
<br>
Add to this the difficulty of passing off between the 2 wizards successfully<br>
<br>
Add to this the fact that both wizards would ahve to be in-zone when the kill-shot is made (which requires decent timing of zoning and kiting), or the effort is wasted for one of them<br>
<br>
Add to this the difficulty of keeping all mobs grouped together when wizard A zones, without having to re-group them.<br>
<br>
Add to this the difficulty of keeping them all snared so that kiting is possible.<br>
<br>
Then add up the amount of time it would take for the kills to be made, and see if all that difficulty is worth it, when you could just be quadding instead.<br>
