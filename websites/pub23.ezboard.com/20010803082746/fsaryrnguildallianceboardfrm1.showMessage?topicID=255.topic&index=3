You and Niema were like co-mothers to many of the young members and we have had a lot of fun...But Milven is correct in some respects. We have spent so much time having fun we forgot to look at the big picture. Amnesty is not capable of providing the kind of raids that a lot post 50 players desire. SGA could do the raids, however, it is a losely knit alliance and most guilds in SGA are doing their own thing.  <br>
<br>
I know many people in the guild don't see my view point on the problems. They are content to play the pre 50 game, even some that have exceeded level 50. BUT there are many members, both pre and post 50 that DO see my point and agree with me. With that in mind, I am going to do what ever it takes to make Amnesty powerful enough to go to the places we cannot reach now. I have the backing of several members that have volunteered their time and effort to help me. <br>
<br>
Without going into detail, just know that what I do, I do for the good of our guild, and SGA. Some people will not like it, some people might even leave. I would rather the nay sayers go elsewhere than loose more excellent post 50 players. The only way to stop me will be to throw me out of the guild. Yeah, this is a mutiny of sorts, except I am not trying to overthrow our leadership, and I am not doing this for personal gain only....If there are members that don't like then let them speak up now so I know who I am going to piss off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugharbad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gharbad</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/11/01 10:01:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ling, I agree and I disagree</span><hr size=1> .. <p><B><I>Gharbad "The Mighty" Champion Of Amnesty!!!</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugharbad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gharbad</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0> at: 7/13/01 3:31:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvainne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/11/01 10:53:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http--braggarts.shareplay.com-pics-Wythe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ling, I agree and I disagree</span><hr size=1> Sorry I skimmed this and you all deserve more than that becuase I am extremely fond of all of you.

<br>
HOWEVER, I don't think you're taking the right approach here, except for Ling perhaps, who has been trying for a while now. In fact trying forever.<br>
<br>
If you want Dain dead, if you want your epics, if you want any of this stuff...then USE the SGA as it is meant to be used. It's an alliance for us so that we don't have to forsake our family-style guilds with real newbies and a sense of community and loyalty for the sake of the &quot;ultimate&quot; end game. The SGA is us, all of us, in all the guilds. We have the potential to be an amazing &quot;force&quot; in the world of Norrath for all of you who care about that...<br>
<br>
By this I mean, stop moping around that Hareq isn't here to organize something and do it yourselves. The crises of leadership in a game like this is that it destroys alot of the fun. The answer is to share the burden of that responsibility. No one person can handle it, but we all can a little at a time. Work with the SGA, track down the members in your level range, organize stuff...<br>
<br>
Look, I'm not on that much and I'm not high enough to help you that much--Velk Mondays is about all I can promise, but if we each take a little bit, the road will be smoother.<br>

We have done several raids as SGA but without a consise method of communication within SGA (such as an aliance chat channel) SGA will not be a safe method of doing the type of raids that require commands to be given quickly, and to be carried out in an instand. OOC cannot be used is such a manner because it can be heard by everyone in the zone, and as such can be spammed, or flooded, or others not in the raid get pissed of and petition, next thing you know you get a tell from from stupid guide telling you to knock it off. <br>
<br>
Then there is a litle thing known as guild loyalty. I know this is going to cause an uproar...<br>
<br>
Not mentioning names, or raids, but it did come to my (and several others) attention that certain players of certain classes were giving preferential priority to their own guild members before others. it caused some heartache, in one case a death, and it made a few folks wary of SGA raids. <br>
<br>
and the third and final issue with SGA raids just simply trying to get everyone together. <br>
<br>
I like the IDEA of an SGA raiding system, its just sort of cumbersome right now. <br>
<br>
Then there is the whole issue of &quot;who gets their item first&quot; and &quot;SGA did a raid for soandso's epic, I want them to do mine too&quot; It would be much better handled at a guild level. <br>

The planes were then buffed up which turned out to be a root of our problem. Then we got a crop of players that just hit the high 40s and thought they we ready for the planes. They new they could just go on a raid and get their planes armor. They would talk too much in ooc saying &quot;/ooc Pull a such-and-such mob&quot; Why that mob? Because that is the type that drops their planes armor ofcourse. Every mob possible was going to be pulled so why the &quot;freck&quot; didnt they just shut up!!! Because they are &quot;loot whores&quot;, as Verant intended!!<br>
<br>
I said this before and I will state it again. The number one rule in a multigroup raid is to &quot;SHUT UP!!&quot; Unless you have something important to add, just be quiet!! The second rule is you will die alot, get little exp, get little plat, and only have a small chance of a nice item; so dont whine about any of this stuff!!! The third rule is support the raid leader even if he or she screws up and you all get killed. It is very difficult to run raids and people not holding to the above rules have managed to burn out; Hareq, Zenknight, and every other person willing to lead planes raids for SGA. SGA has very few raids now because the Bitching and Moaning of the &quot;Loot Whores&quot; has chased our leaders away.<br>
<br>
About us using ooc to communicate: I dont recall any problems from others about this. Ooc is a standard &quot;accepted&quot; way to communicate during raids. Everyone with much experience on multi-group raids know this and it is never been a problem to my knowledge. Some newbie to planes and multi groups raids might complain but normally the rest of the zone tells them to &quot;SHUT UP!&quot; I did seventeen levels in Sol B, and FG and Naggy raids happened all the time. They always seemed to use ooc and it was just accepted that that is the way it is. Any newbie that bitched was soon slapped down by others in the zone not even on the raid. That is just the way it is in EQ. It would be nice if they coded a way to set up a raid chat channel, but they havent so we use occ.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if anyone feels that SGA is not doing for them what they feel it should. My question is; what have you done for SGA? If you want to raid the planes then start leading multi-group raids, gain experience at it and a good reputation; then you can lead a planes raid for SGA. If you cant handle leading raids, then you best support those that do!! Dont Bitch!! Dont moan!! Just do your best to help those under all the pressure of leading raids.<br>
<br>
Although I have lead over 20 raids and events for my guild and SGA, I will not lead a planes raid. There are two many people that go on those raids that are not ready to do so. They are either too low in level, or are too fixated on loot. The amount a bitching and moaning on a planes raid is overwhelming on the leader who has more than enough to do already.<br>
<br>

The entire reason for our interest in this organization is exactly what Bamil and Vaiine have said above.  <br>
<br>
At one point, early in our history, we were offered the option of joining a much larger guild.  We declined, because we formed this guild out of a sense of friendship and family as much as anything else.  Yes, we want to do the large scale, upper end part of the game.  Yes, we want the phat lewtz.  But we want to do this with the friends we have made along the way.  We view the SGA as a unique opportunity to reach these goals, as we make a lot of new friends and go places with them we could not go alone.  <br>
<br>
I see in the other comments above concerns about things like a lack of a guild channel for coordinating raids, and more seriously, favoritism in distributing loot.  I regard both of these as issues that can be dealt with so long as we all agree to work at them.  The reason guilds work is because the people in them know, respect and like each other, and willingly forgive mistakes and screw-ups because that is what families and friends do for each other.  <br>
<br>
I cannot say that I know everyone in every guild in the SGA as well as I know the members of Echo.  But I can say that from what I have seen so far, I would like to.<br>
