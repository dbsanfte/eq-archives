I suppose it all depends on what would one consider as an insult?<br>
<br>
Quote from Dracomin:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
5. In Canada, which people tend to think is a free country, and where guns are also prohibited (at least around the populated areas), the government prohibits &quot;hate speech&quot;, which really amounts to anything that doesnt agree with the governments views on things. Churches are not free to express their own opinions.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now if we change it to: &quot;In USA, which people tend to think is a free country&quot;. Would you consider this as an insult?<br>
<br>
Now if I said this as a foreigner, would you then consider this as an insult?<br>
<br>
I suppose I misunderstood you about your remark on Australia. I am sorry. (However, given your &quot;smugly&quot; debate style you really have to excuse me on that.)<br>
<br>
However, it is quite clear that you provided false evidence on the crime rate increase. There is really no weasel out of this one.<br>
<br>
At best, you can only claim that gun control did nothing to reduce crime. But saying it dramatically increased the crime rate is just outrages. I know you would ask me to provide evidence so here you are: <br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/research/hmonitor/stats/hvr.html">Australian Homicide Rate</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
That is an official Australian government site. So I suppose you can not brush it off as just &quot;ONE page from gun grabbers&quot;.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, could we please know where do you come up with all your information such as your original claim on Australia? Could I adopt your own style and simply brush it off as pro gun propaganda?<br>
<br>
<br>
About logic: I suppose you are extremely good at logic. (of course, that's your unsupported claim, we would have to ask you to back it up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Now it seem to be a logical claim that more gun in circulation might deter crime. (Again I am not sure how are you going to prove this point with real life data.)<br>
<br>
Why is it so illogical that less gun in circulation would result in less gun related death? (Sure, we can't prove this with real life data.) <br>
<br>
So your logic basically only apply to argument that benefit you?<br>
<br>
Lastly about opinion: Can anyone's opinion be quite wrong? I suppose if your opinion is different from mine, than it is quite wrong? This sentiment itself is what is wrong. I suppose majority of the wars started because people do not agree with each other? (Please don't ask me to pull statistic out for this one.)<br>
<br>
I did not initially flame you for your opinion on gun control, I flamed you because I think you were rude.<br>
<br>
But of course............ that's only my opinion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufaithkills.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faithkills</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Will Argue For Food</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/19/02 2:13:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=256>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But saying it dramatically increased the crime rate is just outrages. - Rhineheart<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

So you won't be further be mislead by my statistical 'chicanery' please go there yourself and check the armed robbery rates per/100k citizens over the period 1995 thru 1998, those years before and after the Howard Ban.<br>

You can adopt any style you like however it is not mine. I merely pointed out the article you linked to made general claims which did not apply to the specific case at hand. As I already explained. It mislead you into thinking you had a case &quot;omg not adjusted for population growth!&quot; when you really didn't because Australias poulation just didn't grow that much over the time period in question.<br>
<br>

No the anger you have at me for not agreeing with you that is closer to the problem. I can accept that you are wrong, and have no bitterness about it and not attack you. You however seem enraged by your inability to demonstrate your opinion and force me to see things your way.<br>
<br>
I submit to you it is people who wish to force their views and ideas and religion on others who cause more problems than those who merely wish to be left alone.<br>
<br>
Control your own guns, don't try to control mine, and we'll be fine.<br>

It's amazing how you can twist the figure to whatever way you want. <br>
<br>
Please refer to this link:<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/facts/2001/sec3.html#assault">Crime Statistic</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Go down to figure 33.<br>
<br>
The gun ban started in 1997, now if you have a look at 1995- 1996 figure. <br>
<br>
Why did it increase? the criminal knew before hand that the guns are going to be collected in 2 year and started their activity early?<br>
<br>
For unarmed robbery, it was an upward trend from 1995 to 1997. It peaked in 1997 to about 1200 level and since stayed there.<br>
<br>
For armed robbery, it was an upward trend from 1995 to 1998.<br>
Peaked at about 1100 and since drop to about 800 level.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now is you claim that &quot;ARMED&quot; crime rate increased dramatically since the 1997 gun ban. Is that even remotely true?<br>
<br>
It looks more like that it was an increasing trend but stablized (for unarmed) and dropped (for armed) since the gun ban.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, why is it that you can not provide the link for me in the first place? Or like I said, you used pro gun web site exculsively for your quote?<br>
<br>
(note: assault seem to keep on increasing stablely. Like I said, at most you can only claim that gun control did nothing. Where did it DRAMATICALLY increase ARMED crime rate?)<br>

Furthermore as I pointed out in the last post, biometric safeguards do not exist today.  There is no good evidence showing that they will exist in the next 2, 10, or 50 years.  Trigger locks exist today.  Trigger locks cannot be a stopgap measure for something that does not exist, any more than cars can be a stopgap transportation alternative to personal teleportation and time travel.

Look you keep trying to say I am asserting something I am not, I am not drawing any conclusions based on this that gun control caused an increase in armed robbery, although it looks that way.<br>

What I AM saying is that gun control CLEARLY did not have any positive affect on it.. so why do it?<br>

First while your first syllogism is unimpeachable, the antecedent has NEVER been possible.<br>
<br>
And your second one does not follow from the first, and neglects the likelihood (which has been shown to be true historically) that if there are less guns they will find their way into the hands of the people who have the strongest desire to have them.<br>

THOSE people are probably not the ones you want to control the majority of the guns.<br>

Amen, brother.

It's amazing how your logic works.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

It seems you might have forgot what you have said.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raw Data and Rates.<br>
<br>
What do you mean by raw data here? The actual number instead of rates? Why would anyone want to use the actually number when quoting a statistic? Unless of course, you want to influence the outlook of the data?<br>
<br>
Here is an example:<br>
In the massacre that caused the Australian gun ban, 35 people died in the state of Tasmania. The rate of homicide for the state of Tasmania jumped from 1.1 in 1994-95 to 8.4 in 1995-96. <br>
<br>
Am I going to quote the NUMBER which jumped from about 6 to 40 and claim that because of the abundance of guns, the homicide for Tasmania increased 600%? (Notice the figures are estimates calculated from rates, because for some reason I can't find any official website that would quote the actuall number.)<br>
<br>
How idiotic would that claim be? But that's pretty similar to the claim about Australia.<br>

You know, a few years ago Quake 2 was a great, fun game.  We had LAN parties at convention centers where we'd get together and play.  A good friend of mine was one of the top 100 Q2 players in the world based on online rankings.  But he'd go to these things, do very well, and occasionally get fragged.  It got to the point where he would be winning a level, get killed, then actually leave the convention.  We once had a LAN party at his house and he even left there because he was angry.  Nobody likes playing with a bad sport, and we eventually stopped inviting him.<br>
