I have acquired key now and would like to start a little of that AE group fun, but other than looking for multiple Wizards in HS and asking them to look me up if one of them leaves, I have little way of targeting that specific kind of group for an invite. That leaves starting my own.<br><br>It seems to me that everyone in an AE group better know thier job or all are dead.  Now, what is the best group to put together, and what is the strategy? I understand that a cleric can be handy for buffs and occasional death due to the risk associated with an AE group, also necessary is an enchanter to give the Nukers a chance to unload their damage. This leaves a puller and 3 nukers I would think. Is a warrior the only option or would a bard make a good puller. I would think a Bard would be great, but do they have the AC to actually pull that many mobs and live through the fight, and if so how do they do it? Are there other options when putting a group together? Do some combinations work better in certain dungeons?<br><br>From a strategic standpoint what does everybody do? Cleric just wait out the battle healing as needed or can they add more to the fight? Enchanter just Clarity up, then stand in the middle of the wizards chain casting stun? Is timing an issue with the wizards? Do they just start casting when the mobs get there, or does one start then another, then another to stagger the casting, or is that unnecessary? What spells are best, or do the wizards just cycle through whatever Jyl's spells they have?<br><br>I would sure like some feedback about the success everybody has with this exciting group tactic. Mistakes made and lessons learned would be very helpful. <p><embed src="http://www.allcanadiantrees.com/eq/Zapin1.swf" width="280" height="160" quality="best" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaendayar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aendayar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/16/01 11:28:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is the perfect AE group??</span><hr size=1> Wiz-AE<br>Wiz/Mag-AE<br>Bard-AE slow/pull<br>Cleric-Heal/Res<br>Enc-Stun<br>Mercy slot (aka exp leech)-Best filled by either a mage, a wiz, or a pal/war (pulling)<br><br>Pull to a specific location, and all gather and stand almost on the enchanter.

Enc, Cle, Wiz, Wiz, Bard, and Ranger.  Second set up is Enc, Cle, Wiz, Wiz, Necromancer, and Monk.  IN the first group the Ranger pulled fully buffed and runed.  The trick to ae pulling is have the tank start the pull as soon as celestial elixir hits that way when damage is taken it's healed up some.  (Especially helpful in HS with the ht's)  Now this is how I planned it out and had a regular group, so we had a lot of practice at it and it worked very well.  Ranger would pull 8-15 mobs back to us.. and would run next to the cleric.  Cleric would pop a heal off and aggroe about half onto him.  This is where the two wizards both fire off thunderbold and you'll catch usually 4-6 mobs in it slowing down the damage.  The enchanter lays down a winds of tash, then we the two wizards and enc all run in by the tank and start casting jyll's and ae stuns.  Another method we used to save everyone more then I can count is have the cleric back up after the two wizards thunderstun and begin casting WoR no matter what that way if the enc gets some bad resists and we're all gettin pounded when that goes off it buys us some time.  Plus it aggroes to the cleric some also giving the enc an easier time to get the stun lock goin.  The time between the wizard stuns and the enc getting the stun lock takes all of 5 seconds and this is where we usually died or won.  Only had 3 wipeouts in a month of doin this everynight so it's pretty sound if you practice it.  With the bard in group she just ae slowed and sang mana song to get us goin faster, and with the necro, he basically did the same thing with his conversion spells.  That's pretty much how we did it.  It just takes a lil practice and patience is all.  Good hunting all, I hope this helps some people. <br><br><br>Little edit here we're personally taken out a 20 mob train in the basement of karnors, 17 blue and 3 greens so jyll's definitely hits more then 13 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>Llanos Vishani<br> Innoruuk  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ullann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>llann</A> at: 4/16/01 11:43:48 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uteclisen31.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teclisen31</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/01 12:15:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is the perfect AE group??</span><hr size=1> All you ae newbs, wiz. wiz. wiz. enc 56+ (pulls) 55+ bard cleric, best ae group. If your doing d1/d2 thing or just all of karnors you shouldnt pull anyless then 15 mobs or your wasting mana, your enc needs to be the most skilled, has to know how to pull and when to start chain stunning, wizards basically just need to get right next to the enc and chain cast jyll's spells, bards their to basically decrease downtime between pulls with mana song, add some extra mez/stunning to mobs for the enc. Basically bard is the best utility class you can have, shouldnt drop under 3 wizards. The more damage being done, faster mobs die, less damage anyone takes from mobs resisting stun. ENC needs to be highest lvl due to resists etc, 55 or 56+ is a must, should go with a 58-60 if you can though. Clerics just stand outside and heal, keeping mainly the enc healed. If a pull goes bad, ie too many casters/high mr mobs/slow mobs, 1 wizard is expendable while the enc is essential in group survival. Ae groups can be done with just a shaman/druid as healer if your group is good and has worked with one another before knowing what your doing, although its a lot more convienent having a cleric to rez if things go bad.<br><br>~Teclisen <br>57 Evoker<br>Ring of Valor<br>Bristlebane <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utwompyeverblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Twompy Everblaze</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/01 12:35:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What is the perfect AE group??</span><hr size=1> In my opinion the best group is 2 enchanters, 2 wizards, cleric, puller. <br><br>2 enchanters because when 15-20 mobs are involved you're going to get more than a couple stun resists.

Except, you don't really need to stand on the enchanter.  Just make sure the mobs around you are in his stun range (which varies a bit depending on which lvl stun is active).  It's important to be sure you're facing the enchanter as the spell goes off (knockback pushes the mobs in the direction you are facing).  This pushes the mobs tight around the chanter.  Also, ignore Teclin the aoe noob when he says to have the chanter pull (wtf??).  The bard is a FAR better puller.  Think about it for 10 seconds and it will be clear why.  <br><br>Also, you DO NOT need two enchanters unless they are kinda low level for the mobs you are aoeing.  For karnors, a 54ish chanter is fine unless you unless you are pulling bodyguards and warlords.  If your group is more 57ish, then you are far better off in Sebilis.  Your 57ish group can also aoe in chardok but it's a lot harder to make quality trains there than it is in Sebilis.  But it's a nice option for when Seb is packed.<br><br>One last thing...if you are doing aoe in Seb or Chardok, you will be moving around a lot to get to the spawns (because everything anywhere near you will be dead and you don't want your puller to run a mile to get back to you).  Make sure everyone knows exactly where you're going before you head out.  Also make sure the bard has about a 15 sec lead on the rest of the group (since he will be bringing mobs with him and you don't want them banging on casters).  In general, you don't want to get in front of the mobs as the bard is leading to the new spot.  It's also a good idea to hit the bard with celestial elixir or celestial healing before he heads out to pull or lead to new area.<br><br>I would suggest you start off small (say 6 mobs), and work your way up.  You will get a feel for what you can and can't handle.  If you can't handle 6 mobs easy, then don't bother trying 8, etc.<br><br>After each AoE pull, recheck your buffs and make sure you refresh anything that got dispelled (it happens) or wore off.  Your entire group should have hero + symbol (best versions your cleric can muster), the puller will also need shield of words (or better), and the appropriate cleric buffs.  Bard will play Cantana while you med to reduce downtime.<br><br>I do AoE almost everynight and I can assure you that it's well worth any deaths you may experience learning how to do it.  There is nothing else in game that will give you so much xp in such a short amount of time.  To give you an idea, if you did AoE everynight you could go from 55 - 60 in 5 weeks in a mere three hours per night.  If I didn't do raids all the time, I would have been 60 weeks ago.<br><br>Btw, you don't have to use a bard for AoE, but they are the best choice.  We've used monks, SKs, and warriors when we had to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uremfin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Remfin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/17/01 2:02:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: aoe</span><hr size=1> Perfect AE group?<br><br>Wiz/wiz/mage/bard/enc/cleric<br><br>However, if you want to be safe (which I wanted to be, wipeouts SUCK), 2 chanters to replace either the wiz or mage is great<br><br>Absolutely need a pet, named/resistant ones will make you waste mana nuking them down, and the mage PB AE at 51 is almost as good (maybe better except for recast) than the jyll's line<br><br>HS works, but those HTs are a problem - disco is the ultimate, chef is better if you go with 3 wizards (for higher level groups where disco is greening out)<br><br>I'm also pretty sure PB AE was increased past the previous 16 mob - pet/players limit - we've had pulls of 24 where we hit everything (including the chanter's stuns hitting all 24, which I KNOW use to be capped)<br><br>Let the cleric go all out on heals - nukers mana determines how fast you pull, and you can't afford a death which may happen if you use heal over time spells for mana effeciency <p>Remfin<BR>Level 59 Evoker<BR>Terris - Thule<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaoii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aoii</A>&nbsp;
