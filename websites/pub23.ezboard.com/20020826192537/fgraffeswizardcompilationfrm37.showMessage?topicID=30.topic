I thought I would take a moment to share some of the highlights of this convention of the finest minds in Norrath.<br><br>First, we all convened in the Giant Conference Room in the back of the maze at Skyshrine. There is a reason why there is a maze in skyshrine: it is a test to see if you are smart enough to make it to the conference room. If you find yourself going about in circles, like most people, then you obviously do not belong there. Well, in the Great Room was an assembly the like of which is never seen elsewhere in Norrath: dragons, erudites, gnomes, high-elves, treants, faeries, genies, and wyverns all gathered together to discourse about only the most quintessentially sublime topics. There were even a few drakes there, which made my familiar very happy. The Guest Speaker was Princess Tserrina from the Tower of Frozen Shadow, but due to the fact that she was KOS to many in the conference hall, she had to speak to us through Remote Astral Scryer.<br><br>First speaker was Larkon Theardor from the Library Mechanamagica in Ak'kanon. This scholar spoke in grave tones about a phenomenon sweeping Norrath, commonly referred to as &quot;HGS&quot; which if you haven't figured out yet, stands for &quot;Hot Gnome Sex.&quot; He argued that the phenomenon could be explained in evolutionary terms: females from other species unconsciously realize that their weak species will die out unless cross-fertilized with the higher genetics of gnomes. My own mentor, Tarkar Blazetoss from Felwithe, then interrupted Larkon by pointing out that if that reasoning were correct, then female species would be equally throwing themselves at high elves as well. With a twinkle in his eye, Larkon countered by replying that we could only deduce that gnomes had a superior genetics. As Tarkar and Larkon began to shout at each other and demand a duel right then and there to settle the issue, I could only think that one person's logical deduction of a conclusion given certain premises was another's proof by contradiction that one of the premises was false. An important philosophical lesson was to be had there, assuredly.<br><br>The audience hushed up quickly as the next speaker teleported to the podium with the most controlled shadow step you will ever see. The great dragon Talendor from the Temple of Veeshan spread its wings and made itself comfortable as his ancient eyes filled with impregnable wisdom cast a mezmerizing glance at the crowd before him. Talendorian ethics is perhaps the most revered of all ethical philosophies, and the wise dragon spent his time summarizing the &quot;results&quot; from his fifth volume of his massive Ethica Magnima. According to Talendor, ethics is about acting in accordance with rules of reason that obey strict astral principles. If you act for any other reason than pure obedience to these rules, then you are lowering yourself to base matter and your action becomes completely worthless. For example, suppose there was a riot in Freeport and you knew you could prevent the riot by incriminating some n00b at the Freeport gates and tling him to Cazic Thule. Given the fact that you would be saving hundreds of innocent lives, would that be the right thing to do? Not according to Talendor, who holds that each &quot;spirit&quot; (read: self-conscious entity) ought to be treated as an ends, and not merely as a means to an ends. Using the n00b in this way would violate a strict astral principle, and thus should not be done even if it saved the lives of everyone on Norrath. <br><br>I wont bore you with some of the next few talks, which were mainly abstruse and meant only for a very specialized audience (one of the talks was entitled &quot;Cosmogonic Phenomenological Analysis of Triumverate Unmezzable Systems&quot; by some erudite chanter, I think I slept through that one). A fun talk was given by a drake named &quot;Pookie&quot; entitled &quot;Gating and Dating: How to Have the Best of All Possible Worlds&quot; and he gave us some tips that are meant only for a mature audience, so I will not share them with you in this forum. <br><br>The highlight of the day, however, was witnessing the darkly beautiful Tserrina share her radical political philosophy with all of us. She began with the bold statement: &quot;Since the Sleeper has been awakened, everything is permitted.&quot; She returned to this again and again as a refrain to her poetical discourse. For example, she would state something like &quot;You have heard it said that you should help your fellow neighbor and strive to be worthy of an eternal life.&quot; And then: &quot;But since the Sleeper has been awakened, everything is permitted.&quot; I confess I didn't completely understand the logic, but I found myself completely won over to her point of view. At the end of the talk there was a wild thunderous applause from the gallery (from all but the Talendorians of course, who appeared stupefied by her pronouncements) until we realized the consequences of her teaching. Then the backlash began: there were howls and jeers, staunch steadfast repudiations, damage shield spells were flaring all over the place. Suddenly above the fray a shout was heard, I think from that rascal Larkon: &quot;Raid on Tower of Frozen Shadow! Phat Lewts Await!&quot; and groups starting tping out of there faster than a zone crash into Shadowhaven.<br><br>I was saddened that the dignified Philosophy Conference degenerated this way, but I took solace in the fact that my participation had earned me &quot;Kindly&quot; faction status with Claws of Veeshan-- and I had learned many valuable insights from that drake Pookie that I intended to put into practice immediately. As for Tserrina's bold announcement &quot;Since the Sleeper has been awakened, everything is permitted&quot; I confess I am still troubled by it. At times it seems to open up my consciousness to a newfound sense of freedom and exploration. But then my conscience returns and I realize that the way of Duty and Service to others is the way of my people and all High Civilization. And so I pledge my continued support to you, my fellow wizards. And I am available for a raid on the Tower of Frozen Shadow any time.<br><br>Until the next conference, fare thee well.<br><br>Best<br>Faenir<br>60 Sorceror <br>Soul Sanctuary<br>Torvonnilous <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uastarafas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>astarafas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/28/02 8:26:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skysrhine Philosophy Conference</span><hr size=1> That  was GOOD ! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Astarafas, fellow flamethrower...err philosopher <p><p align="center"><ahref="http://mysite.freeserve.com/Intereo_Liberi/test3.htm"target="_blank"><imgsrc="http://mysite.freeserve.com/Intereo_Liberi/mythresult/incubi.jpg"border="0" width="330" height="175"></a><br>I took the <ahref="http://mysite.freeserve.com/Intereo_Liberi/test3.htm"target="_blank">What Mythological Creature Are you?</a> test by<lj user=peacefulchaos> !</p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showPrevMessage?topicID=30.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showNextMessage?topicID=30.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=30.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.emailToFriend?topicID=30.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.threadControl?topicID=30.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=30.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=30.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
