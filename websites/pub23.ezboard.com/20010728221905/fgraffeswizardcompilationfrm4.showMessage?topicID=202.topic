Unfortunately, a lot of people will just think all pally's are useless because their damage output isn't very good.  <br>

A lot of the problem stems from the fixation on DPS.  Everyone's convinced that DPS is the only thing that matters.  The reality is that DPS is important but it's far from the only thing that's important.

<br>
More damage in certain ways seems like the answer. There's no point starting to redefine what a wizard is and making us Masters of Arcane Teleportation or some such.<br>
<br>
I can see why they are stuck. Bane spels or mob specific spells are NOT the way forward though. I don't play the game to wait 60 levels (God what play time must that be??) to get two spells for a handful of dragons that supposedly defines the class. It don;t add up.<br>
<br>
Here's an idea. Some spells from D&amp;D like:<br>
<br>
Web (area effect movement disabler - creatures get caught in a web). Effects the actual area unline BoF which hits on the creatures who then move with it.<br>
<br>
Cloudkill (a cloud of deadly gas that, again, effect an area)<br>
<br>
Group Invis 15' radius.<br>
<br>
etc etc - just go look at the D&amp;D manuals. If these guys actually wanted to fix us they woulda done this already though I suspect.<br>

I hope they are going to do something on indirect damage output since direct damage is out of the question. The only other way for us is indirect damage absorption (rune and other shields) and utilities.

The real problem is, when we got nerfed, initially, everyone noticed it, and it's been downhill ever since.  I give you this scenario... How many times, when someone is contemplating accepting you into a group do you get this, &quot;How much does your best DD do?&quot;  I get this all the time.

In fact pre Kunark we were well worth playing and just as viable as other classes.<br>
<br>
The whole game is now unbalanced though. The scaled up damage output from tanks due to scaled up weapons led to scaled up mobs. Casters didn't get damage output spells scaled up though and that means Wizards, who are dependant more than all others on their damage outpu, consequently lost out more than all others. <br>
<br>
A reason that this scaled up out of proportion mellee damage did not lead to large scale exploitation and too much unbalancing in the &quot;old world&quot; is that there aren;t these Uber items in the old world and not the same amount of high level dungeons for them to fight in. What if our damage spell rampup was in spells above 50?. Put a level cap on some items also to stop *some* high level items going into ickle level 5 characters in the old world and unbalancing it.<br>
<br>
I think they screwed it by putting too many uber items and mobs with Uber HP in. They should ahve managed the expansion from 50-60 a LOT better.<br>
<br>
Now we have a mess that can't be worked out without either a sop to Wizards, a slap in the face to Wizards, or even more imbalance possibly. I dunno - I keep changing my mind about this. Just wish Verant would be brave and put everything on the table and see what can be done rather than just fighting a rearguard action against ANY change.<br>
<br>
I still maintain though that the change in the 50-60 level game inpacted us more than any other class and it was FAR from a positive impact. WE DO HAVE ISSUES - we're not just whiners!!<br>

its really funny to sit lfg in Sebilis, seeing group after group forming and walking deep into the dung, while im watching TV, just getting disturbt bye someone who needs a translocate.. i like the translocate spells... without them i felt REALLY useless.<br>
<br>
btw: our damage output isnt very well... its not enough to define that class. maybe it was enough before kunark an velious, but today all ubermobs have billions of HP. in 51 my max damageoutput is somewhere near 5 K? compare this with a tank? or necro... or mage.. or any other damagedealing class.<br>

<br>
I play a wizard, I like wizards, but anytime I put together a group, I'm sad to say, I don't let other wizards in. I usually go for a warrior, healer, chanter, and try to fill the other 2 spots with a rogue/monk/ranger or warrior.  I won't even invite any other casters to fill the open spots, not because people say they suck, but because my experience is that you can kill more mobs faster with an additional meleeer.  As far as paladins and sks go, I get any other meleeer first.  Why? because they do more damage, regardless of how well played the paladin or sk is, it's not based on paladins/sks whining, it's based on seeing them in action.<br>
Heck, I didn't even know they did whine, and I surely don't read their message boards.<br>
<br>
I play my wizard, I see how in a steady group I generally cast 1-2 stuns and a single nuke per pull (if that, and that's with clarity).  I know I'm an xp mooch.  Would I want another one in the group?  Heck no!  I have a limited amount of time to play, while I'm playing I wanna maximize my xp return, and that doesn't involve adding more wizards.<br>

I know someone is gonna say, well you already have a wizard, you don't need more than one.  We're not a specialty class, we don't mez, we don't buff, we don't heal.  We don't have a specialty ability that is required, but not duplicatable (aside from the rare cases where you need evac, but why not get a healer/buffer/evaccer in that case).  We do damage, that's is, therefore we're interchangeable with any other damage dealer for the 3 or so damage dealer spots.  If wizards could hold their weight, they'd be in the runnings to fill the damage dealer slots, reality, we're last on the list of damage dealing classes to fill those spots.  Why get a wizard for this slot when you can get a meleer who can do substantially more damage over the course of the grouping sessions and take a little bit of damage if need be.<br>
<br>
It's not perception people, it's reality.  However much we whine, it's not gonna change the days of firsthand experience seeing what classes/groups are good that everyone 45+ has had.  I don't need to see a bunch of parsed logs comparing damage to tell me how much I sit on my ass and how little I contribute in an xp group, I get to experience it firsthand. <p><hr>

That's assinine. No one wants Wizards.. how many times do I see &quot;fast xp group lfm&quot; and I apply, and hear, &quot;we need a healer&quot;, or &quot;we really need another tank&quot;.<br>
<br>
At any level you can look at the Wizard and look at any other caster class than cleric, and NOT ONLY does our dmg/hour pale, but most of them have comparable nukes. Yes, they can't cast them as rapidly in succession as we can.. BUT NEITHER CAN WE. WE get killed if we try. Sure, if the shit hits the fan, we can try to mix root nuke concussion as fast as we can, but xp groups avoid those situations, and an enchanter can handle those situations with one application of mesmerization, wheras if we do we are completely oom. And every other caster class offers something else besides damage/hour than we do. We have the LOWEST damage per hour. And we offer nothing else.<br>
<br>
I NEVER say how much I suck in a group, hell I play the court jester, give up loots, anything to prove what a swell person I am so I'll get a group next time. But everyone knows the facts.<br>
<br>
We are complaining because we DON'T get groups. If we did we wouldn't complain. Most Wizards past 40, probably are a little masochistic and enjoy the challenge of being arguably the hardest class to play. If we could just get by. If we were just on par.<br>

Cleetus, I hate to use ad hominem logic, but you just need to pipe down in the peanut gallery until you have a clue.<br>

I started doin Seb at 50 (had my key at 46). But its frustrating as all get out. Blue Krup wizards (i'm 53 now) have so many HPs that I can burn a full tank of mana on one mob and do about 50% of its life. So we're, or at least I'm, really not all that much help in an overpull situation anymore.<br>
<br>
I used to pride myself on my timing. Back in SolB and CoM in my 40s I could get to the point with a group that I would take every mob instantly from berserk to run/death (in CoM they generally dont run, so the goal was next melee shot after spell lands is death blow) and remain at 70-80 mana with constant pulls. This is no longer an option, when one spell does 1/20 of a mobs total health theres a lot of berserk time that I cant do anything about. Stuns are ok, but not particularly mana-efficient. Lately I've been using Tears quite a bit, as it can really increase the mana efficiency, and doesnt aggro nearly as much. The only downside is resist rate.<br>
<br>
Now I mostly play a reasonably twinked Warrior, and I have found to my chagrin that my groups efficiency is increased a lot more by adding another melee, rather than a nuker. When you call mana check and it goes like this : Chant/Dru/Sha - 70, Cleric 90, Wiz 40, its an issue. I cant tell you how many times I keep pulling and just say med thru (i also give them a tell saying back off a bit, do your share and dont sweat it, we know you are valuable, u dont have to kill everything...)<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts,<br>

Ironically, we do not get into groups because of our ability to deal damage. The only reason I've been able to get groups outside of friends and guild is because I can snare. Evacs are few and far between in the post 50 game, if I mem an evac once per level that's alot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=202.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=202.topic&start=41&stop=46>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=208.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=203.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=202.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=202.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=202.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=202.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm11">Velium Chill of Al'Kabor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm6">Tome of Ages Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4>Rant Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
