To prevent the Government from misusing it's Powers.  If you do not believe that can Happen today I pity you.<br>
<br>
It has already happened, not to the extent that firearms were needed, but still look at the arrest of Dimitry Skylarov last year.  That was the government overstepping it's authority.  For those that are unfamiliar with the case, Mr. Skylarov was a Russian programmer who wrote a program in Russia that broke the encrytion on Adobe's Ebook format turning them into an ordinary PDF that could be copied and read anywhere.  Mr Skylarov came to the US and spoke at DEFCON in Las Vegas where he was arrested by the FBI for violating the DMCA.  Keep in mind that his &quot;Crime&quot; Was commited in Russia, and broke no Russian Law.<br>
<br>
The recent Terrorist attacks against the US caused several new laws to be looked at at least.  One in particular was to allow terrorists to be tried by Millitary Tribunal.  Another that was looked at was to classify &quot;Hacking&quot; as Terrorism.  Now some acts of Hacking are terrorism, however many are simply children playing within the system trying to find out what they can get away with.  This does not justify the Death Penalty that is available through a Military Tribunal.<br>
<br>
Our government is built upon a system of Checks and Balances, with powers bestowed BY the People.  Without a Way to defend against an oppresive government (Please Note I am Not saying it IS necissary, only that option should be available) the powers are Taken FROM the people.  <br>
<br>
Firearms are what made this country what it is.  Without them we would not be what we are today.  <br>
<br>
I for one would rather Not look to anyone else to protect me.  I shall protect myself.  If you are comfortable begging and crying for somebody to come save you, so be it.  In the mean time I shall do what is necissary to protect myself.  If that means owning a Firearm, I shall do it.  If that means getting a concealed carry permit, I shall do it.  If that means carrying a cell phone so I can dial 911 should I happen to be mugged and waiting 5 minutes for the police to arrive, sorry, that is longer than I am prepared to wait.<br>
<br>
The main difference in Pro-Gun Vs Anti-Gun in my opinion is that Pro-Gun simply wants the Option there should they feel they need it.  Anti-Gun seems to want to take away because they feel Nobody needs it.<br>
<br>
Thank you, but Do not try to take My Firearms away.  I served this country to protect the freedoms we have.  Not see them pissed away by people who do not feel we need them anymore.<br>

No and no.<br>

The US Constitution was aimed at limiting encrouchments on freedoms by the government IT defined.  One of that defined government's responsibilities was to defend against external threats.<br>

US citizens have guns, me included. The day all guns are illegal is the day this country ceases to exist as a democracy.<br>

I like the system but the problem is always the ppl running it. Somone always gets gready and guns in the hands of US citizens prevents congress, the president or the supream court from taking over.<br>

Truthfully, there is not alot of case law on the subject.  The case law that does exist tends to inidcate that the decisions in this area are the province of the Legislature, not the courts.<br>
<br>
     Although the rhetoric of the NRA denies this, their actions bear it out. The NRA tends to focus on the Legislature, using political pressure to keep firearms legal.  They tend not to focus on the courts, as they recognize this is a waste of resources.  Compare this with the ACLU which does the exact opposite - i.e., focusing on the courts while not focusing on the legislature.  Both strategies have been effective for both the relevant groups.  <br>
<br>
     The point?  There may not be one, except to become politically active to promote your pro-gun agenda rather than relying on the courts.  Donate to the NRA if you feel strongly in this area, they are one of the five most influential interest groups in our country. <p>Torcer Arcana - 60 Sorcerer - Brothers of Darkness - The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uswanda08.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Swanda08</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/02 7:15:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://broodwar.gcpro.de/fun/fanart/Kyron2_tn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Wanna know something?

<br>
Yes but the Isrealis and Swiss have free access to more and larger guns and have a homicide rate 1/10 of what the us has.<br>
<br>
That you can give up your guns and not be oppressed right away is not the point.<br>
<br>
Of course that can happen.<br>
<br>
But you can never get your guns back.<br>
<br>
I will submit to you that the fact that the US retains the right to bear arms allows other nations to be so irresponsible as to take away their citizens guns. Deny it all they want the US by being the most powerful nation AND being free exerts an influence on the world. There is an expectation that if the worst abuses happens the US will sort things out. This is a foolish thing to think, but there it is. We _have_ many times but what should be realized is that it only happens when it is convenient to us. There are atrocities in China but we do nothing. If say France went to shit and there were death squads running around marauding against a disarmed population, I am not certain the US would do anything but bitch.<br>
<br>
The power of a democracy is derived from the power of it's people. If the power becomes symbolic then the power will inevitably shift in favor of the entity with the real power. This has already happenned, to a large extent as the weaponry available to the government is superior to that of citizens. And this has been usewd frequently as an argument for gun control, since the power has shifted drastically what difference does it make if citizens have guns? This question shows however a lack of understanding of the way oppression historically works. It must be _easy_ to systemically oppress. Typically the police (or secret police) are the first agents of oppression and it is just not practical to requisition a tank every time you want to have a little fun and kill a political dissident and rape his wife. It spoils the pleasure if you have to risk getting shot each time.<br>
<br>
Will this happen tomorrow if the US repealed the second amendment?<br>
<br>
Of course not.<br>
<br>
But that will make the power of the people TRUELY merely symbolic. In time inevitably the power will shift more and more until we are no longer governed but are _ruled_.<br>
<br>
And unlike when the US was born there will be no turning back. The military power available to governments is vastly superior, as mentioned, to that of the citizenry. In the revolutionary war both sides had the same technology. This is not so anymore.<br>
<br>
Giving up the right to bear arms is IRREVOCABLE.<br>
<br>
Are we SO sure this is a good idea?<br>
<br>
Certainly not. In districts where the is strict gun control, like DC the murder rate is _higher_. Other countries with free access to guns have MUCH lower homocide rates.<br>
<br>
There is no conclusion to be drawn between gun control and homicide. There is logic BOTH ways but the statistics do not bear it out.<br>
<br>
1. If I have a gun I can stop a violent crime being perpetrated upon me, and my mere posession acts as a deterrent.<br>
<br>
(arguments against: the bad guy will take your gun, you will be an idiot and shoot yourself, and you will not have the gun at the right time)<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
2. If no one has guns a gun cannot be used against me.<br>
<br>
(arguments against: there is no possible way to ensure no one has guns and criminals will not obey gun control laws, violence does not require guns anyway)<br>
<br>
So we have no evidence that banning guns would help with violent crime. We have evidence to the contrary, though.<br>
<br>
Does it make sense to ban guns forever? Knowing we can never UN ban them?<br>
<br>
Further, the government has NO legal responsibility to protect you. The purpose of the police as legally defined in court precedent is to enforce the law AFTER it has been broken. You may not hold the govt liable in any sense for failing to protect you versus crime.<br>
<br>
Therefore the only person morally and legally responsibility for you and your families safety is YOU.<br>
<br>
If you let yourself or your family die woe be unto you for having shirked this responsibility.<br>
<br>
Failing to have a sidearm at the right moment is a mistake one rarely has oppportunity to learn from.<br>

This has always been the case, and recently Western governments are becoming more and more removed from the voting public and deep, entrenched coporate corruption is becoming endemic.<br>
<br>
Most people are not fit to own firearms, most people do not understand violence, can control their temper, understand the repercussions of use, or even the basic facts of weapons.<br>
Many people are not fit to drive cars, bring up children or work in atomic power stations--there's plenty of evidence for those points.<br>
<br>
making guns illegal ends up with only criminals having weapons. Governments cannot control the flow of drugs, never mind weapons, britain has draconian gun laws but I can assure you you can buy automatic weapons illegally and they ARE used in crimes here.<br>
<br>
Stupid legislature and power grasping justice systems can end up with people sentenced for legitimate self defence, where as armed criminals get LIGHTER sentences than a person defending themselves from aggression.<br>
<br>
A broad bladed edged weapon, such as a large kitchen knife, is actually more lethal than most firearms, you are FAR more likely to die from a stab wound than most gunshots.<br>
<br>
If you take it that its legal and morally acceptable to buy tobacco, alcohol, peticides and guns, you must also viw the use of currently illegal drugs as acceptable, because they kill VASTLY fewer folk and if you are allowed ot commit slow suicide by cigareetes, what's the difference with heroin, which is oen tenth as addictive?<br>
<br>
If the West, with good reason, blew the crap out of human reprobates who massacred 3000 people for no good reason, why havent the Green Berests broke into the offices of major tobacco firms and summarily executed many executives who conspired to hide evidence of their products lethality, addictiveness and of making these features deliberately, methodically WORSE, which will/has probably resulted in the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> deaths of 250 million people?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
I am showing several points on this topic. Overall,  people should have the right to own firearms if they are not criminals, insane, can show good knowledge of procedures, storage and safety. No oen should just be able to go BUY oen from a store, but people have the right to enjoy things in this life, but there are responsibilities and their must be proceedures. People too often talk of &quot;freedom&quot; without considering &quot;responsibility&quot;, people too often talk of &quot;control&quot; when its their own &quot;fear&quot; that causes the reaction, not rational thought.<br>
  You fire a gun in the air, you should be JAILED. You drive a car drunk you should be JAILED. (or similar stern legal warnings, not mere slap on the wrists) Both of those scenarios have the likelyhood of getting someone injured or killed. People would be outraged at the former, to foten they would jsut think its no big deal of the latter, but a car will make a mess of you.  If you would jail a person for accidentally, but foolishly  shooting without care, what do you say to those who have had limbs ripped off, faces destroyed, children killed by drunk drivers?<br>
<br>
You get angry, you lash out, if a gun is near, it's too easy to pick it up and use it. Few people can control their tempers well enough to restrain it to a verbal tongue lashing or a simple kick up the backside :&gt;<br>
<br>
If someone breaks into your house, what are oyu going to do, talk to them nicely if they are intent on robbery, rape and murder? On the other hand, have you the patince and will to act calmly, wait to thorughly identify the person, call the authorities and make sure it isn't your daughter late from aher boyfriends before you kill her?<br>
<br>
Adolph Hitler wasn't a german phenomenon, Stalin wasn't unique to Russia, Mao  wasn't a genocidal manipulating scumbag just because he was Chnese. There HAVE been Western politicans, military people and beauracrats who have been corrupt, who knows what they may have tried? Who knows what they may be UP to? There is plenty of evidence linking a certain intelligence agenxy with terrorism, drugs, hindering investigations and politcal assasinations, and it isn't the KGB...So what would you do if they, or someone else, overthrew your government, perhaps covertly? If al weapons are strictly controlled and few in number, they will swiftly disarm the populace.<br>
<br>
There's an earthquake, people using race, politics, poverty as an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> excuse</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, go on a rampage, armed with firearms they behave like vermin. And for those who think that wouldn't happen in a white, Western area, I suggest you go study history. barbarity becomes rampant, the Army has to come in, people cry out about civil liberty as peopel are sumarrily executed, for crimes of the most disgusting kind, and are often shot in the act of commiting them. The Army/police are facing armed rioters, totally out of control, there is no talking with such people because there is no LEADERSHIP, its a mob, and a mob is vermin (harsh but you'll find it's mostly tue, mobs bring out the worst in people)<br>

<br>
It turns out this is not true. It happens but it happens rarely, and people get stabbed to death with intent as well.<br>
<br>
People are social animals and their base impulse is to _dominate_ not slaughter. Why do you think military training is the way it is? It is a form of brainwashing the intent is NOT primarily to get people to stay in a scary situation, people will do this from peer pressure and loyalty and love and honor. Most men will naturally not run when trouble happens if their friends or family are left behind. This is instinctual, evolutionarily ingrained behavior. You see it in EQ all the time, people die when they should have run because group member was left behind. It's not universal but it happens a LOT. And this is merely a 2d simulation.<br>
<br>
The urge to kill generally however has to be taught. Why do you think gang inititations are the way they are? Or why do you think the process of becoming a made mafiosa is the way it is?<br>
<br>
It is because in general humans are not inclined to kill until their minds have been warped a certain way.<br>
<br>
To get most normal people to kill you have to face them with a situation where they know it is life or death, and even THEN many people will meekly die rather than kill.<br>

<br>
Personally I view gun ownership as more of a privilege than a right.  If you abuse your privilege then you should lose it.  By abuse I mean committing a crime using a gun. If they are a repeat offender with a weapon, then put them away for life.<br>

You are more likely to be killed by someone you know, you are very likely to be killed by them when drunk or on drugs, it is often a crime of passion of rage, THAT IS A FACT.<br>
The hsuband sees the wife with another man.<br>
The wife in frustration shakes her child to death.<br>
The youth in anger uses a knife<br>
etc etc.<br>
<br>
People when angry WLL kill, they often don't mean to, they are not thinking, that's the problem.<br>
<br>
Here's an incident I know from real life.<br>
2 brothers, once  acrook, violent, other has a family, nice guy.<br>
Bad brother gets into an arguement with another youth, they both pull knives, good brother steps in to try and calm them down and gets killed. Here guns are not common, if they were, they would have used them, they fought in town, on the street, in day light, with guns the odds are several of them, plus others may have been wounded.<br>
You can also argue that maybe they wouldnt'have used guns because you KNOW when you pull a gun you are liley to die, but too many idiots don't realize knives are often more lethal :/<br>
<br>
You are right that gang, or should I say &quot;stupid&quot; culture, encourages this crap. Most people as individuals, on their own, will behave far more responsibly, but in a crowd...ugh (my point about mobs)<br>
<br>
But its simple fact, many folk are NOT very responsible, whether it be with a car, gun or anything else.<br>
