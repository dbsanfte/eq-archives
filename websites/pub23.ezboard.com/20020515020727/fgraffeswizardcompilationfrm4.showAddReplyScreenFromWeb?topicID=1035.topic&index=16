Few people can control their tempers well enough to restrain it to a verbal tongue lashing or a simple kick up the backside&quot;<br>
<br>
It turns out this is not true. It happens but it happens rarely, and people get stabbed to death with intent as well.<br>
<br>
People are social animals and their base impulse is to _dominate_ not slaughter. Why do you think military training is the way it is? It is a form of brainwashing the intent is NOT primarily to get people to stay in a scary situation, people will do this from peer pressure and loyalty and love and honor. Most men will naturally not run when trouble happens if their friends or family are left behind. This is instinctual, evolutionarily ingrained behavior. You see it in EQ all the time, people die when they should have run because group member was left behind. It's not universal but it happens a LOT. And this is merely a 2d simulation.<br>
<br>
The urge to kill generally however has to be taught. Why do you think gang inititations are the way they are? Or why do you think the process of becoming a made mafiosa is the way it is?<br>
<br>
It is because in general humans are not inclined to kill until their minds have been warped a certain way.<br>
<br>
To get most normal people to kill you have to face them with a situation where they know it is life or death, and even THEN many people will meekly die rather than kill.<br>

You are more likely to be killed by someone you know, you are very likely to be killed by them when drunk or on drugs, it is often a crime of passion of rage, THAT IS A FACT.<br>
The hsuband sees the wife with another man.<br>
The wife in frustration shakes her child to death.<br>
The youth in anger uses a knife<br>
etc etc.<br>
<br>
People when angry WLL kill, they often don't mean to, they are not thinking, that's the problem.<br>
<br>
Here's an incident I know from real life.<br>
2 brothers, once  acrook, violent, other has a family, nice guy.<br>
Bad brother gets into an arguement with another youth, they both pull knives, good brother steps in to try and calm them down and gets killed. Here guns are not common, if they were, they would have used them, they fought in town, on the street, in day light, with guns the odds are several of them, plus others may have been wounded.<br>
You can also argue that maybe they wouldnt'have used guns because you KNOW when you pull a gun you are liley to die, but too many idiots don't realize knives are often more lethal :/<br>
<br>
You are right that gang, or should I say &quot;stupid&quot; culture, encourages this crap. Most people as individuals, on their own, will behave far more responsibly, but in a crowd...ugh (my point about mobs)<br>
<br>
But its simple fact, many folk are NOT very responsible, whether it be with a car, gun or anything else.<br>

This is a myth. Else I would be be sitting on a mound of bodies by this time.<br>
<br>
&quot;But its simple fact, many folk are NOT very responsible, whether it be with a car, gun or anything else.&quot; - Redorious<br>
<br>
There is a difference between irresponsibility and cold blooded murder. It may please you to think that you are the ultimate predator, only held in check by by the restraining laws of society, but it turns out you are just another Bonobo monkey in a tree screaming loudly and trying to get laid.<br>
<br>
Even in lawless regions it is only the hadrened criminals (in which I include police of an oppressive government) that kill. The rest of society continues on, families survive and only the people inured to violence by one method or another doing the killing. That a very few people trained to violence can cow an entire nation is the very proof of this. Most people are just NOT violent. Humans bluster and bray but they don't kill for the most part. Very few people kill without being taught to. Shout yes, brawl yes, kill no. It's a primate thing.<br>
<br>
I am sorry to hear of that incident but it doesn't change the reality. There are always going to be cases of brutality. You say this brother was a crook, so yes, his job was crime, he had been trained to violence and thus that happenned. Note the 'good' brothers impulse was to _put_ himself in harms way to try to bring peace.<br>
<br>

<br>
This is natural statistically. For someone to kill you they must be physically close to you to do so. The people physically close to you are generally people you know. I would not draw much from this. It is like saying you are more likely to get into an accident the closer you are to your home. Well of course, you do a greater proportion of your driving close to your home than otherwise.<br>

That said:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  -Extensive background checks (Maybe along the lines of 30 days). Those people who decide they want a gun for personal defense will still be able to acquire one. Those potential criminals who are planning ahead may still be able to acquire guns, but it would hinder the ability to buy a gun quickly (I say hinder because there will still be the black market).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Good idea, but I'm not sure if you realize how easy it is to obtain a firearm on the black market.  Seriously.  It is amazingly easy if you have cash.  Maybe not so easy in the suburbs, but take it from a city dweller.  With a couple few hundred in cash I could have a Beretta in about 45 minutes if I wanted one.  I suppose what this idea could do, if you extended it, would be to track who is getting their guns stolen or 'misplaced' after crimes are committed or illegal weapons are seized, but the current registration process could do that already.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> -How about a license for guns? I have to pass a test and get a license to drive a car, I think it would be perfectly reasonable to expect the same for gun ownership. It could be a weekend class that teaches the basics of handling a gun and how to be safe with your gun. A test would be administered at the end of the class (both written and target). There is no reason why people should be arming themselves if they don't know how to use the gun, or have the ability to hit their target.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
We already have people talking about bias in SAT testing.  Imagine the uproar if we find there are demographic differences in who is passing the tests and 'getting armed'.  Scenario - based on statistics it is discovered that one-legged, colorblind midgets of Scandinavian descent are 30% more likely to fail the test.  Johann (Shortie) Johannson, leader of the OLCBMSD Association of America, becomes certain that the rest of the country is stockpiling arms in an effort to keep the people in his association down.  Then we have civil unrest.  And I don't know about you, but the thought of thousands of blonde, 1-legged midgets taking to the streets of St. Paul fills me with a very wierd feeling.<br>

Amen, brother.  If in the course of an unrelated investigation, police should find a firearm in storage that belongs to you that does NOT have a child lock on it the offender should be charged with a Class III mistomeanor.

First off terminology. These are properly called trigger locks but it always makes sense to say your agenda is 'for the children' so you can then ask in an outrage of anyone who disagrees with you 'how can you be against the children?!'<br>
<br>
You show me a lock that works for children but does not hinder the use of a weapon to an adult (like child safety caps on prescription drugs) then I will allow that it is a 'child lock'. As is, it is an 'anyone lock'.<br>
<br>
Second if a person has a firearm and a child it stands to reason the point is to protect his family including the child. If there is a keyed lock on the gun this drastically reduces the chances the person will be able to protect them.<br>
<br>
Third accidental firearm deaths are not common at all especially compared to burglaries, murders and rapes, though whenever one happens it is front page news.<br>
<br>
Fourth why should someone without children be obliged to pay for and use a 'child lock'?<br>
<br>
Fifth for as long as there have been guns families have had them and acted responsibly with them.<br>
<br>
What I DO like is biometric locks, ( like in Logans Run or Judge Dredd<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) or ratjer guns with biometrically activation but they have to be made foolproof and instant. I must be able to pick up the gun and fire it without any extra activity or thought, because if I need to do so my life may depend on those extra seconds.<br>

I would definitely pay for that.  Should they be mandated?? Not so sure about that. But I'd use them myself.<br>

This statistic from a Reuters article which was PRO gun control.<br>
<br>
Over the TEN year period 1988 to 1997, 1,782 children died to accidental firearm deaths AND SUICIDE in all 50 states. This is an impossibly small number over that time frame for the entire country. Further it includes ALL forms of suicide (i can only assume to speciously make the number larger) so the number of children killed in real firearm accidents is lower.<br>
<br>
This means the actual accidental rate in the entire nation is no higher and probably much less than 178 per year.<br>
<br>
Compared to the total number of murders in 1998 or 16,914 the number of children that died can be assumed to be reasonably close to 1% of total murders.<br>

No. Although I am aware of no study showing this it seems reasonable that it would have some affect. (though children can find keys too)<br>

What I am saying is that the risk is already incredibly low compared to the risk that the gun is there to help you protect yourself from in the first place, and the trigger lock will mitigate a gun's effectiveness for that purpose.<br>

Statistics previously quoted indicate certainly they did a decent job in the 10 year period studied. In 1988 66 million guns were floating around in the US, but less than 178 children died accidentally. This means that your real risk of accidental child death is approximately 0.0000027 % per gun.<br>

As for suicide? First that's not strictly relevant since someone bent on suicide has many more means at his disposal than firearms and furthermore can easily circumvent a trigger lock given time. The only reasonable purpose of trigger locks is to prevent accidental firearm injury. It will have minimal to no effect on determined activity.<br>

No, what you are saying is that the risk of dieing from an accidental handgun death is small compared to the risk of being murdered.  But that is not the relevant statistic.  The relevant statistic is the number of accidental handgun deaths compared to the number of deaths that handguns have prevented.  And even then, it would only matter if the death was prevented in a situation where there would have been no time to get the lock off.<br>

I do not have a child, but I am forced to pay for and use child locks on medication bottles and lighters.  On the gun, you wouldnt even be forced to use it.  The cost of the lock is small compared to the product, but if that still upsets you, then I would say they should at least be sold next to the gun.  The option to buy and/or use one should be apparent and easy.<br>

Well I should have thought Leona's post would shut everyone up. I suppose not  FK<br>

Im not saying guns alone kill people.  But this is also a comparison between two very different societies.  While there is validity in showing that it is possible to have a high number of guns in a safe/peaceful society, it does not prove that guns make our (US) society safer.  I could point to Northern Ireland to counter that example (but again, N Ireland is a drastically different society than ours).<br>

Imagine the uproar if we find there are demographic differences in who is passing the tests and 'getting armed'.  Grindel<br>

Thats a valid point.  But Im talking a basic competency test here.  Pretty much anyone who wants to get a drivers license and who does not have any physical or mental problems that would prevent him, can get one (though some people need to take the test more than once).  Im talking about the same kind of testing for your gun license.  If your willing to take some time to teach yourself how to use a gun, youll pass.<br>

It is virtually impossible to complie accurate statistics in the gun control debate.  If someone SUCCESSFULLY uses a gun to defend themselves/deter a crime, they usually don't consider themselves victims and therefore these types of incidents usually don't get reported.  <br>
