<br>
The assembly took about 1 hour. And i was one of the pickup wizards they gave a tell to come over. Because this was my first pickup for such a raid, and I didn’t have any fire resist gear, I had a hard time believing I would survive this.<br>
<br>
At one time we ran into the zone, where I found that I really hate Nagafens Layer. Got jumped by spiders and bats. Finally in prep room, there were 2 buff groups, onve buffing was running it went well, until I logged out. In chat we had to wait for 1 and a half hour because the last groups had to clear the Giants again.<br>
<br>
When fight began it really went fast in the beginning, until the casters came in. I resisted all the fear spells. I got a few partial resists on my IceComet. I got a Full Hit on my IceComet and a few Full resist. This all because Lord Nagafen was roaming around because the Tanks could’t hold him in one place. One moment I was under his tail, the other moment I was looking down his throat. <br>
<br>
I got my Insufficient mana message, throw in a lower level ice nuke, cast harvest, Modulate, ran closer again Cast IC again, at which time Lord Nagafen begins to notice me and slaps me one time. He turns around again, I see that by this time all my group members are either dead almost dead or so full healt it can’t be healthy. I get between his legs again, cast IC with my last mana. It hits at least. Lord Nagafen turns around and starts whacking me for good this time, LOADING PLEASE WAIT…..<br>
<br>
I get up, hear the raid leaders yeling to pull him back and get him off the bridge. I mem Icecomet, ran back inside, through his legs over the bridge and see almost only corpses in the main hall. I stand under naggies tail, spit out 4 ice comets, get my low on mana again at which moment I remember I do not have my full int and mana gear. Naggy sticks his head under the door. <br>
<br>
I see my mana bar Jump up (Thanx to whoever that necro was) cast another Icecomet, partial resist, then I see You gain experience. The Dr00d in my group got the kill from his final blast. Damn, I wanted a screenshot of the confirming kill. <br>
<br>
Well at least Nagafen died. But what a mess. I started translocating people out with the little mana I had. Then got a Rez, then spent the rest of the time translocating people again, and throwing an Ice Comet on a few Fire giant warriors.<br>
<br>
I wonder if there are raids where it isn’t such a Chaos, the tanks are able to Hold Nagafen down, and the Wizard does not die after being OOM, and Modulating once.<br>

Some higher level members of the hosting guild had cleared the giants and took turns doing the buffing.  This meant higher level buffs and less downtime for those going in.<br>
<br>
Our first try was a failure.  We got Nagafen down to 5% health.  At that time I realized I was the only one still charging in, trying to get another IC off.  I lost a corpse in the mess, but oh well.  So I talked to the other wizard present, asking how her Comets worked (I got one full and several partial hits).  &quot;All resisted,&quot; she said.  A sickening feeling rose in my gut.<br>
<br>
&quot;You know you have to stand right under him to land spells, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot;  Here was a level 50 wizard with a 50+ tank main who did not know this.  And Nagafen had been at 5% health.  I explained the whole thing to her, managing quite well to conceal my contempt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Second attempt succeeded with about 2 deaths.  What a difference a wizard can make.<br>

<br>
The trick is to setup the buffing like mentioned.  Have 1 main tank with a secondary.  The puller wants to pull Naggy to the bridge and the door without dieing.  Keep the door open. The main Tank then goes in and solos for about 5 seconds and MUST BE KEPT ALIVE. All healers need to pump him health.  He will then do enough damage and grab the agro.  During that 5 seconds the other tanks need to run behind Naggy and stand on the bridge.  The secondary then starts hitting for about one round before all melees attack.  Nobody but the main tank taunts (ALL PETS TAUNT OFF).<br>
<br>
The Chanters come in and Suicide Tash and manasieve while a Shaman slows.  There is the possibility that agro is concentrated enough on the tank that chanter will live, but I am used to the term suicide tash.<br>
<br>
At about half health all nukers are called in and they need to be in melee range for the nukes to land. The easy way of doing this is to have all casters try to scratch his belly.<br>
<br>
All this being said is from surviving a Vox and a Naggy raid.  Learned it from watching one of the best guild leaders on Vazaelle, Eeepers.  I think on Vox we had 2 deaths. On Naggy I think the same.<br>
<br>
NOTE:  Any leader that does not buff the nukers because they dont want to &quot;waste peridots&quot; should have all nukers not join in then.  The nukers need to be kept alive also or they cant land the nukes.  (Sorry - Ranting from a bad experience) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=branaman>Branaman</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_purplespot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/24/01 10:17:16 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Here is a part of my logfile.

3) Tanks bouncing naggy all over the place<br>
4) people that don't know what they're doing<br>
<br>
Naggy tend to have a good shot of success on my server if they're led by certain people. Vox is almost always a mess, and she's usualy up for weeks between kills. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucastaa123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Castaa123</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://home.pacbell.net/jcortel/flashingcircle003.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/24/01 1:18:16 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.neverwhen.com/EQ/castaa/CastaaBust60.jpeg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just been to my first Naggy raid.</span><hr size=1> Naggy and Vox are training dragons.

You'll go on a raid eventually. Hell, I never killed Vox or Naggy, and never will now that I dinged to 53. Now I can look forward to killing all those dragons in Kunark, and Velious.<br>
The only plane I've been to is PoF, and the first time was a CR hell. I've had invites to PoH, but I didn't feel like going without at least a few of my guildies.<br>
I guess my point is, you'll have alot of opportunities to raid the planes and dragons. Just make yourself alot of friends, eventually you'll be asked. <p><center><IMG SRC=http://www.interofficenetworks.com/demo/doh/jarnin3dsig.jpg><br><center><Br><Br>Grand Master Fisherman<Br>Master Brewer<Br>Master Chef<Br>Master of Begging<Br><Br><b>DEATH TO AL`KABOR!</b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoanad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goanad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/24/01 4:49:36 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just been to my first Naggy raid.</span><hr size=1> My first I guess &quot;epic&quot; encounter was with another character, level 52, and it was Naggy. Didnt go well. Butnot because of poor execution or planning. Some idiot trained half a dozen lava duct spiders on raiding party when we had Naggy to less than half health. <br>
<br>
Most recently though, I've had the opportunity to return to Nagafen's lair on a mission to destroy Ragefire and his friendly dragon bud that spawned after Rage died. Went down much better. Main tank really kept mob glued to them allowing the two or three wizards present to pull up behind the dragon at about 60% health and then it was Lures away........<br>
<br>
I would say the dragon last no more than two or three minutes tops. Exhilirating.........I ended up with about 2 bubs of life left and my resists are crap(human wizzy, just clawed my way over 200 int recently). <br>
<br>
At level 53 now..my only regret is that I missed a chance to do Voxx when she was aggroed out of her chamber early and wiped almost everyone out..../sigh<br>

My first Vox raid was far more difficult but I survived once again to get the xp and win the roll on the eyepatch <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Now that I've got that eyepatch, there's no real reason for me to bother raiding old world dragons any more and can get to 53 :P <p><Font color=red>Eindyin Romenril<br>
