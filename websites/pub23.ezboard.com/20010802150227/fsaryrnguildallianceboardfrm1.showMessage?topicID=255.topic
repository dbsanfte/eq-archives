I will still be around, and hope to see you all. If you need me, let me know and I'll do my best to be there for you. Zadoc and Kindren will still be in Amnesty and hopefully i can make more alt nights now. Please don't think my leaving has anything to do with any of you, I just need to have fun again, and even though you probably dont understand why, i hope that you can understand about needing to have fun. Some of you may have thoughts of UBER lewtz and such, but that has nothing to do with this, I just need the excitement of killing things that are big, most things i kill are btm =( and not really a big thrill.

<br>
I am lvl 55 now, and only been 2 Hate raids and 1 Fear raid, with 2 of them total wipeout at zone in and one of the CR lasted 14 hours. And whe I ask SGA to organize regular raids, some said SGA is not responsible for putting up raids for members. Do you know what my eq life would be with Amnesty from now on? Probably you know and I know and everyone else knows: Look for group at Sebilis every night, that is all. Will I be able to visit Veeshan Peak or Temple of Veeshan? Will I be able to kill Dain, Giant King, Lord Yelina, Tomb sleeper? Only in my dream. Not with Amnesty or SGA.<br>
<br>
Most of high 50 members left for uber guild. With Hareq who is so prominent at Amnesty and SGA leaving first, how can I blame anyone else? Go for it, Malle, and Niema too, no reason to stick around to try to foster a plane capable guild/alliance forces as Amnesty officers. It can't be done, it is just easier to join another uber guild that raids planes, uber zones as regular as my daily routine visit to Sebilis. <br>
<br>
good hunting!<br>

You and Niema were like co-mothers to many of the young members and we have had a lot of fun...But Milven is correct in some respects. We have spent so much time having fun we forgot to look at the big picture. Amnesty is not capable of providing the kind of raids that a lot post 50 players desire. SGA could do the raids, however, it is a losely knit alliance and most guilds in SGA are doing their own thing.  <br>
<br>
I know many people in the guild don't see my view point on the problems. They are content to play the pre 50 game, even some that have exceeded level 50. BUT there are many members, both pre and post 50 that DO see my point and agree with me. With that in mind, I am going to do what ever it takes to make Amnesty powerful enough to go to the places we cannot reach now. I have the backing of several members that have volunteered their time and effort to help me. <br>
<br>
Without going into detail, just know that what I do, I do for the good of our guild, and SGA. Some people will not like it, some people might even leave. I would rather the nay sayers go elsewhere than loose more excellent post 50 players. The only way to stop me will be to throw me out of the guild. Yeah, this is a mutiny of sorts, except I am not trying to overthrow our leadership, and I am not doing this for personal gain only....If there are members that don't like then let them speak up now so I know who I am going to piss off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugharbad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gharbad</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/11/01 10:01:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ling, I agree and I disagree</span><hr size=1> .. <p><B><I>Gharbad "The Mighty" Champion Of Amnesty!!!</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugharbad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gharbad</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif BORDER=0> at: 7/13/01 3:31:46 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvainne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/11/01 10:53:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http--braggarts.shareplay.com-pics-Wythe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ling, I agree and I disagree</span><hr size=1> Sorry I skimmed this and you all deserve more than that becuase I am extremely fond of all of you.

<br>
HOWEVER, I don't think you're taking the right approach here, except for Ling perhaps, who has been trying for a while now. In fact trying forever.<br>
<br>
If you want Dain dead, if you want your epics, if you want any of this stuff...then USE the SGA as it is meant to be used. It's an alliance for us so that we don't have to forsake our family-style guilds with real newbies and a sense of community and loyalty for the sake of the &quot;ultimate&quot; end game. The SGA is us, all of us, in all the guilds. We have the potential to be an amazing &quot;force&quot; in the world of Norrath for all of you who care about that...<br>
<br>
By this I mean, stop moping around that Hareq isn't here to organize something and do it yourselves. The crises of leadership in a game like this is that it destroys alot of the fun. The answer is to share the burden of that responsibility. No one person can handle it, but we all can a little at a time. Work with the SGA, track down the members in your level range, organize stuff...<br>

We have done several raids as SGA but without a consise method of communication within SGA (such as an aliance chat channel) SGA will not be a safe method of doing the type of raids that require commands to be given quickly, and to be carried out in an instand. OOC cannot be used is such a manner because it can be heard by everyone in the zone, and as such can be spammed, or flooded, or others not in the raid get pissed of and petition, next thing you know you get a tell from from stupid guide telling you to knock it off. <br>
<br>
Then there is a litle thing known as guild loyalty. I know this is going to cause an uproar...<br>
<br>
Not mentioning names, or raids, but it did come to my (and several others) attention that certain players of certain classes were giving preferential priority to their own guild members before others. it caused some heartache, in one case a death, and it made a few folks wary of SGA raids. <br>
<br>
and the third and final issue with SGA raids just simply trying to get everyone together. <br>
<br>
I like the IDEA of an SGA raiding system, its just sort of cumbersome right now. <br>
<br>
Then there is the whole issue of &quot;who gets their item first&quot; and &quot;SGA did a raid for soandso's epic, I want them to do mine too&quot; It would be much better handled at a guild level. <br>

The planes were then buffed up which turned out to be a root of our problem. Then we got a crop of players that just hit the high 40s and thought they we ready for the planes. They new they could just go on a raid and get their planes armor. They would talk too much in ooc saying &quot;/ooc Pull a such-and-such mob&quot; Why that mob? Because that is the type that drops their planes armor ofcourse. Every mob possible was going to be pulled so why the &quot;freck&quot; didnt they just shut up!!! Because they are &quot;loot whores&quot;, as Verant intended!!<br>
<br>
I said this before and I will state it again. The number one rule in a multigroup raid is to &quot;SHUT UP!!&quot; Unless you have something important to add, just be quiet!! The second rule is you will die alot, get little exp, get little plat, and only have a small chance of a nice item; so dont whine about any of this stuff!!! The third rule is support the raid leader even if he or she screws up and you all get killed. It is very difficult to run raids and people not holding to the above rules have managed to burn out; Hareq, Zenknight, and every other person willing to lead planes raids for SGA. SGA has very few raids now because the Bitching and Moaning of the &quot;Loot Whores&quot; has chased our leaders away.<br>
<br>
About us using ooc to communicate: I dont recall any problems from others about this. Ooc is a standard &quot;accepted&quot; way to communicate during raids. Everyone with much experience on multi-group raids know this and it is never been a problem to my knowledge. Some newbie to planes and multi groups raids might complain but normally the rest of the zone tells them to &quot;SHUT UP!&quot; I did seventeen levels in Sol B, and FG and Naggy raids happened all the time. They always seemed to use ooc and it was just accepted that that is the way it is. Any newbie that bitched was soon slapped down by others in the zone not even on the raid. That is just the way it is in EQ. It would be nice if they coded a way to set up a raid chat channel, but they havent so we use occ.<br>
<br>
I am sorry if anyone feels that SGA is not doing for them what they feel it should. My question is; what have you done for SGA? If you want to raid the planes then start leading multi-group raids, gain experience at it and a good reputation; then you can lead a planes raid for SGA. If you cant handle leading raids, then you best support those that do!! Dont Bitch!! Dont moan!! Just do your best to help those under all the pressure of leading raids.<br>
<br>
Although I have lead over 20 raids and events for my guild and SGA, I will not lead a planes raid. There are two many people that go on those raids that are not ready to do so. They are either too low in level, or are too fixated on loot. The amount a bitching and moaning on a planes raid is overwhelming on the leader who has more than enough to do already.<br>
<br>

We declined, because we formed this guild out of a sense of friendship and family as much as anything else.  Yes, we want to do the large scale, upper end part of the game.  Yes, we want the phat lewtz.  But we want to do this with the friends we have made along the way.  We view the SGA as a unique opportunity to reach these goals, as we make a lot of new friends and go places with them we could not go alone.  <br>
<br>
I see in the other comments above concerns about things like a lack of a guild channel for coordinating raids, and more seriously, favoritism in distributing loot.  I regard both of these as issues that can be dealt with so long as we all agree to work at them.  The reason guilds work is because the people in them know, respect and like each other, and willingly forgive mistakes and screw-ups because that is what families and friends do for each other.  <br>
<br>
I cannot say that I know everyone in every guild in the SGA as well as I know the members of Echo.  But I can say that from what I have seen so far, I would like to.<br>

Mall...good luck and you already know, if you need me, ask.<br>
<br>
#2.  Guilds...for any of you that dont know, I was one of the ones that started Amnesty....I was GL , back when Blood Reign was about the only guild in the planes on the server. I tried to keep the guild together during crappy times, I tried to get the guild in an alliance when we needed help doing anything bigger then Mistmoore. And back then there were people who worked to the same ends, people who had the initiative to DO something, and even back then there was those who preferred to complain and look for more ( and NO I am not indicating  Malleolus..I am referring to those who sit and bitch and moan that they dont have this or that and expect everyone to help them get it, but really in all honesty never add anything but work to the guild).<br>
<br>
There was also a third group of people, ( that in a way was comprised of a few from the other two groups) ...that wanted a group of people they knew and liked to play with every night....but wanted to be able to DO big things, and sort of felt that no matter how hard they tried, no matter how hard they worked, there would always be some things that were * just* out of reach. They were torn between staying &quot; family&quot; and having fun by doing bigger things ( and wanting to do bigger things is not evil, it does not make you an UBERwanna be.....not giving a rats arse about  having fun, and having friends, and *only* wanting the big things makes you an UBERwanna be).<br>
<br>
I left Amnesty in a vain ( no coincidence there) attempt to keep the guild together because there was those amongst it that wanted change that I felt was not what the guild was about. They had aborted, and taken a large number of impressionable  people with them. I left so that the impressionable ones could &quot; stay&quot; and have their friends later in game life. I knew the retards would drop out or be chased out soon enough. They were, and alot of the &quot; young impressionable&quot; ones  rose to the top and proved that they had learned and grown and took charge , forming a decent guild , that pretty much has always lived up to the intent it had when it was formed.<br>
<br>
<br>
I tried another guild..a larger guild....and got sick of it . So sick I had to quit playing for months. The people are......well lets just say that they are not folks I would want to deal with in real life, and I see no reason to spend my recreation time having to practice my people skills so strongly. ( restraint of ones urge to kick someone in the head is not recreation).<br>
<br>
<br>
Others ( even from Amnesty) left and joined the same guild over time, for much the same reasons. They too have left it and moved on.  Does this make my second guild &quot; bad&quot;?...no...its just not right for ME.<br>
<br>
What I am saying is that for the most part, you guys have a good group of people. If you want something in this game, it is attainable..it is after all, just a damned game. The world does not end when a few people leave, the goals do not change, and the abilty to get what you want does not get thrown out the door. And no one is going to die if you fail a few times.<br>
<br>
Mall leaving is ok...he wants something different, but he will still be on your friends list wont he? There is no indication that he or the guild is BAD. Just....turning.<br>
<br>
Get the groups together and do something that thus far, Saryrn has not been able to foster.....an alliance of people who have friends to play with nightly and a bigger group to take down pixelMOB_03_ when  needed. 10 bucks says when you start planning that raid, people like Mall will be there to help his &quot; friends list&quot;...and the folks in the guild you want to kick in the head will be elsewhere complaining about something or another.<br>
<br>
THAT part ( the seperation and strife) has certainly been done before on the server guys...by bigger and &quot; better&quot; ( * cough* ) guilds then you.<br>

<br>
Thank you for that wonderful post Aionne. I had totally forgotten about Blood Reign. Man, did that guild implode.<br>
<br>
Her post is right on the money. Did Mall and Niema leave Amnesty? Yes, they did. Did either of them leave the SGA? Not unless we tell them to. We've always had a general policy that friends of the SGA are allowed on our raids. Mall and Niema are our friends. Their friends are my friends and they should be yours.<br>
<br>
I can't think of an event that someone has organzed that hasn't been well attended. If there was one, it probably had more to do with timing than anything else. We have proven that &quot;if you organize it, people will come&quot;. Want to start your epic? Do the legwork, plan it and organize it. Want that cool item from a mob? Same thing.<br>
<br>
Before one says &quot;the sga does nothing for me&quot;, realize that the sga is here to help you achieve your goals. They are not, however, here to do all the work for you.<br>
<br>
There are pleny of experienced leaders here that if asked to help you plan en event would be more than willing to show you how it is done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bsaryrnguildallianceboard.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=tygrexsilwa>Tygrex Silwa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/15/01 11:42:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=255.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Opinions.  Idea?</span><hr size=1> I agree with most of what most people have said here, for I believe the truth lies more in the middle than on the edges of what's been said.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it's less convienient to use /ooc than /guild.  At first I had a hard time picking it out of the spam I make with my very low-delay weapons.  But I adapted and learned to see it anyway.<br>
<br>
I believe that as each guild in the SGA grows we will one by one gain the power to singly enter the planes, dungeons, or wherever that we want to go for our Adventures or Phat L3wts (whichever you want to call it.)  Personally I envision that as one of our guilds begins to reach that level, those of the player level required from other guilds can be brought along to fill in the gaps and receive invaluable raid experience.  For instance, if Amnesty wanted to do hate sometime in the future, but we were about a dozen bodies short of what we needed, and Dragonchow had the extra manpower we needed, we make it a 'joint raid' and hit the plane hard.  Little by little we grow bigger until we can each hold the planes on our own.  Little by little we approach that terrible word &quot;Uber&quot;.  But by doing it 'little by little', we try -- no we FIGHT to retain that which makes each of our guilds special.  We actually LIKE each other.  I remember seeing a triple pull in the Kael Drakkal arena.  The primary tank is my roommate.  We both know we aren't making it out of this alive.  But we're with the SGA.  We fought to the very last hitpoint.  We fought tooth and nail and the clerics camped out.  And we LIKED it, simply because we were with our friends.  Now I have no idea what it's like to be in an Uberguild, but I imagine that in many cases the only reason that people would take a death willingly is because they fear losing their Uberguild-tag if they don't die for their guild when called to.<br>
<br>
Powergaming is about &quot;Me&quot;.  SGA is about &quot;Us&quot;.<br>
<br>
One idea.  How difficult would it be to get a group of 2nd chars that are made Officers within each of the SGA guilds, thereby creating a group of chars that could instantly be available to restore the guildtag of any player in the SGA?  Perhaps locate them in/around Freeport for general convienience of the population.  You go on the SGA raid hosted by say SG.  Everyone picks up their SG tag (like tuning your walkie-talkie to the right channel).  Boom, we tear ToV a new arsehole (yeah, right).  Port back to WC, everyone runs into FP and grabs up their normal guildtag from the &quot;Tag Mules&quot;.<br>
<br>
Yeah, not the most convienient thing in the world, but who knows, maybe someone out there thinks it's a good idea.  Incidentally, I have two accounts at my disposal, one of which is comprised entirely of Mules, entirely in the FP area... if this idea is deemed worthy, I humbly offer my services to the SGA.  (I figure I can put 9-10 mules to work in this capacity.)<br>

Just so people don't get the wrong idea. The raid issue is not why I changed guilds. Personally, raids are a very, very low priority for me. As much as I would LIKE to be able to do them, I just don't have the time to do a 13 hour raid.<br>
