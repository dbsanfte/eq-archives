Run places where there are 2 or more possible ways to go and drop a nuke on the tank as he starts to go the wrong way<br>

Nuke him before he knows your there as the first shot or maybe shots will give you quite an advantage<br>

Wizards are not unbalanced because its possible to be interupted IF the tank hits you for all or most of the spells cast time.

Be honest here..do you even acknowledge the restrictions of manaburn and the ridiculously vulnerable state it leaves a wizard in ?  Yes manaburn may = sure death in some scenarios...but it is more defensable than some of the other class attacks/gear.<br>

I don't think this is unbalanced.<br>
<br>
Let me give you a quick definition of balance in pvp.  First off any idea of precise balance in pvp is futile.  What we're looking for is a fun aproximation.  <br>
<br>
Pvp between any 2 given classes is balanced when pvp is fun and challenging between them. One party may be favored offensively or defensively but not to the extent that either party feels like they are wasting their time.  Some lvl of difference is fun...its called a challenge.  Past a certain lvl of challenge it because BS and unfun. Take any class at 60 vs a 60 sk as an example of that.<br>
<br>
I don't think rogues are unbalanced vs any class at all though we are I think strong vs wizards.<br>
<br>
The 66% dmg nerf is fair entirely in wizard vs rogue pvp.  If you haven't noticed my suggestions in the thread 45 people looked at but nobody cared to reply to include a suggestion for adjusting that on a class by class , lvl range by lvl range basis btw. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uneyfearsthe2nd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neyfears The2nd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/8/02 12:59:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=50>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> I understand what yoursaying but..</span><hr size=1> I understand your point in making PvP reasonable for all involved.

<br>
You prove my point..prior to manaburn, this was exactly the problem with wizard in PvP.  We had one choice beyond certain death...run.\<br>
<br>
Now it is more interesting.  Now the cleric, fungied warrior etc etc has to determine whether or not:<br>
<br>
a)  Is it a manaburn wizard ?<br>
<br>
b)  Is the wizards manaburn up ?<br>
<br>
c) Is the wizard full mana ?<br>
<br>
d) Is the wizard able to get a 6 sec spell of to hit me if a, b,and c apply..(which is not very often)<br>
<br>
This is the new challange.  Prior to this it was ...Ooohhhhh a wizard  /drool.  I wonder how quickly this one will go down or gate ?  Yeah that was fun.<br>
<br>
Now it is more fun and FAIR for both sides.  Also, this is not he only AA skill that enhances other classes btw..True Shot ?  Lethal against casters in 99% of situations.  Harmtouch, that Nec HP burn, complete heals, gear, the list of unbalances in PvP is large...I only wish they were as incapacitated after using these as we are..unfortunately, this too is unbalanced...*sigh.  You'll learn to live with it I would imagine, just as we have been forced to do for years.<br>

<br>
66% of nuke dmg vs. Int classes<br>
86% of nuke dmg vs. Priest classes/bard/ranger/rogue<br>
100% of nuke dmg vs. Sk/Warrior/Paladin<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes I'm sure most people would disagree with this, but allow me to have a moment to defend this:  <br>
<br>
The melee classes, as not only the masters of melee damage, are also the masters of melee defence (ac).  The casting classes, aside from a cleric and shaman, don't even come close to the ac of melees.  Int casters are the most suceptible to melee damage, in addition to having the least hp, on average.<br>
<br>
Nuke defence is not quite as clear cut.  To defend against nukes someone needs high fire/cold/magic resists, which absolutely any class can get.  Honestly, I think resists on most classes are very balanced (I probably said otherwise before, but oh well).  Resist gear like blue diamond gear can be worn by anyone, so is getting resists high for most really an issue?<br>
<br>
So, lets assume you believe most people can get near to the same *high* resists on a pvp server, let me tell you about nukes damage vs high resists--its pathetic.  I almost always get partial resists on my draughts, my most commonly used nuke.  When a 66% nerf is cut down even more to a partial resist, the nuke ends up being like 50-200hp much of the time.  Since I am a wizard, I have the option of using a lure, but at a very high casting time and a high mana cost--but then again, that's fair since I don't have high hp/ac, a pet, can't heal, or rapture, right?  So when talkng about the best defence vs. nukes, the classes with the most hp and ease of healing have the best defence.<br>
<br>
OK, so to recap so far ... melees have the best defence to melee damage, and tanks/priests have the best defence to nuke damage due to high hp/healing ability.  Wouldn't it make sense that since melees, esp. tanks, have the best defence against melee damage in pvp; int casters should have the best defence against nuke damage?<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
My suggestion for spell dmg percentage tables...<br>
<br>
It goes as follows. Each class gets a series of table based on lvl range. The level ranges for int casters would be...<br>
<br>
1-19, 20-28, 29-38, 39-48, 49-54, 55-60<br>
<br>
priest classes would be slightly different<br>
<br>
Each table would look like this...<br>
<br>
Wiz 1-19 Table<br>
Dmg vs wizards x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs enchanters x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs mages x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs necromancers x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs warriors x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs rogues x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs monks x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs rangers x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs paladins x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs beastlords x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs shadow knights x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs bards x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs druids x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs shaman x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
Dmg vs clerics x% of full dmg in pvp<br>
<br>
This would allow them to precisely tune dmg rather than just nerfing it to 66%. <br>
<br>
In addition I think individual spells should have 3 new attributes.<br>
<br>
A) pvp dmg modifier so that single spells could be tuned to be stronger or weaker when used on players. A spell with a 1.5 modifier when used in a situation with 66% spell dmg as per the tables above would do the full listed dmg - resists.<br>
<br>
B) pvp resist modifier to give players more or less chance to resist the spell, I believe there is allready a general attribute that is similar but that it effects both pvp and pve which doesn't allow accurate tuning for pvp.<br>
<br>
C) set resist lvl modifier to be used in place of attribute B for some 50+ spells that would set the base lvl of resist for a spell. In other words the 54 druid nuke scorae might always hit as if the target has x lvl of resist. X being a number that is fair for all parties.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking C might be reserved for lvl 60 spells and it would have to use either the given level of resist for that spell or the players resist whichever was lower.<br>
<br>
Examples...<br>
<br>
60 mage nukes a rogue with shock of fiery blades, base dmg is 1005 dmg.  modifier vs roguemight be 66% so the spell does 663 dmg the spell itself may have a -5% so you get 630 dmg this is then checked against resisting.  Since it is a 60 spell it has a base resist lvl as described above say its 100.  It will be checked against 100 fire resist unless the rogue has less than 100 in which case the lesser number will be used.<br>
<br>
A 60 wizard nukes a sk with garrisions superior sundering, base dmg is 2100, modifier vs sk might be 100% so dmg is 2100, the spell itself may have a +10% modifier so dmg is 2310. Since it is a 60 spell it has a base resist lvl as described above say its 100.  It will be checked against 100 fire resist unless the sk has less than 100 in which case the lesser number will be used.<br>
<br>
Do not take the -10% modifier or the +10% modifier to mean I favor buffing or nerfing those specific spells in pvp  That was only an example. <br>
<br>
In general I would favor giving a greater than 66% modifier mainly to the 55-60 tables and largely to nukers hitting classes with high high hp or healing power.  Specific spell modifiers that would be calculated after the base reduction by class would require a lot of testing and discussion I imagine.<br>
<br>
This set of suggestions is a much better solution than messing around with the modifier for resist debuffs in pvp helping some spells to much some to little.<br>
<br>
The second attribute even adresses an enchanter concern with NOTHING landing. If spells had attribute B certain spells could be given inherently less resistance when used in pvp without making them more powerful in pve or raising the pvp resisted debuff modifier (currently all resistance debuffs do 1.5 normal when used in pvp) to such a ridiculous extent that enc end up blinding, rooting, and owning people.<br>
<br>
In addition the first attribute would provide a clean way to remove mannaburn from the pvp environment as verant has stated is neccesary. Simply set attribute A to 0% of full dmg in pvp.<br>

I have no trouble or fighting someone in range who isn't twinked out.  Granted, this is different in the high end game where just about everyone can get high end gear.<br>
<br>
My problem is with resist gear.  Ya, I can get resist gear, great.  That does nothing to melee damage coming after me.  How can you call it balanced when melees can get equipment that cuts my damage output by 80%  (That's 80% of the already 60% nerf)<br>
<br>
Where is the gear that a wizard can get that cuts melee damage by that much?  What do we need to balance these items?  an ac 500 tunic, casters only?  An insta-click item that cuts target's strength by 150?  or maybe thier dexterity?  Ya, we get skins/runes but at low level all my leatherskin can do is buy me time to gate from the twink who hasn't been able to hit me, but I've drained all but the gate portion of my mana bar on to only get him to half life.<br>
<br>
I have no trouble with our damage being nerfed, but dear God!<br>
<br>
Things to protect ANYONE from spell damage:<br>
<br>
- 60% nerf  (with 550 hp's, I'm very glad for this)<br>
- resists (from gear, or level)<br>
- stuns, interrupts<br>
<br>
Things to protect ANYONE from melee damage:<br>
<br>
- Dodge (hahahahahahahahahahah... riiiiight)<br>
- Parry  (not casters)<br>
- ac      (clerics can wear plate... I wear a nightgown)<br>
- stuns  (too bad they're all resisted)<br>
<br>
<br>
Can anyone tell me of ANY gear in the game that cuts melee damage the way resist gear makes me an impotent old man begging to be cut to pieces and have my nice silky clothes made in to chew toys for some warrior's little bichon-frise?<br>
<br>
Let me be clear - I'm talking about the pre 50 game here, and my point is the game is unbalanced in the ITEM and LOOT section, not the class section.<br>
<br>
That is all.<br>

Twinkage isn't a balance issue between classes...ever.<br>
<br>
Now if they decided to nerf twinkings effect on pvp that would be good but not likely.<br>
<br>

&quot;31 wizard on TZ. I have no trouble or fighting someone in range who isn't twinked out.&quot;<br>
<br>
I think thats the most important sentence right there.  If you with your nightgown like AC are balanced in pvp then you don't need more protection from melee dmg.<br>
<br>
On another note you can improve your hp and ac if you don't need a ton of extra manna for the fight which could often be the case vs a caster or a chain or leather wearing melee.  I suggest you start by contacting a friend who makes jewelry. Should be easy enough to add 200-250 more hp for about 500 or 600pp which will keep you alive a lot longer.<br>
<br>
I can definately say as a melee that there is a signifigant difference in how fast a naked chump goes down vs a caster with decent gear even at the high end.  Theres your melee protection. It exists. Now as far as the resist gear.  It doesn't do shit vs lures. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uneyfearsthe2nd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Neyfears The2nd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/21/02 3:41:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lures ?</span><hr size=1> Lures ?<br>

I am going to show you how twinking, contrary to your unfounded provacative statement, DOES affect class balance. So here is the true story of a fight between me, a twink wizard, and a twink shadowknight. Also, don't try to make this about rogues and lures, because at level 31 we don't have lures, and shadowknights aren't rogues.<br>
<br>
 With like 158 int and over +100 mana at 31 I got jumped by a twink sk. The sk must have been pre 30 because of the spells he cast on me. The level difference means alot for resists. I was able to spend 80% mana nukeing him, and he went down to 50% life. Keep in mind he is 2-4 levels below me. Now I only have the ability to do another ~12.5 percent damage to him, in which case he would have been 37.5% hp with near full mana and I would have been oom. This is the effect that his twink gear had on him.<br>
<br>
Now for the effect that my twink gear has on me. I resist his snare so that I actually have a reasonable chance of movement. I have hp gear and decent ac so I die slower. Its what got me to where I am in the fight.<br>
<br>
Now lets compare. Do to his twink gear I have about 1 dps at this point in the fight. He is no longer in risk. Do to my twink gear, I was able to get to this point in the fight were I now have to run.<br>
<br>
You said &quot;Twinkage isn't a balance issue between classes...ever.&quot; This quote is just not reasonable. One more thing appearently didn't understand: &quot;31 wizard on TZ. I have no trouble or fighting someone in range who isn't twinked out.&quot; This does not mean &quot;my class is superior&quot; this means &quot;I am good at pvp&quot;.<br>

My attacks as a wizard are checked against resists.  Melee attacks are checked against (from what I know) AC, evade skills/attributes.<br>
<br>
OK.  So what I was trying to say was the gear available to cut my damage SUBSTANTIALY is available to everyone.  What gear is available to casters that cuts melee damage so substantialy?<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
I was in my low 20's wandering through EC on my way to Neriak.  There's a lvl 15 druid (a DRIUD for God's sake!) pk'ing some young darks.  So I take it upon myself to make her go away.  I'm buffed up with skins/shields appropriate for my level.  I don't bother with a SoW.  I used to fight in this zone a lot, so I figure I know where she's medding.  Sure enough, I hit her with a spam of Temperate Flux staff to check her mr and get her other resists down a touch.  By the time she stands up my first nuke is on her.<br>
<br>
She was willing to just stand there and cast so I start in on her with SoL and she can't get squat off.  Every so often I'm dropping a big nuke.  Her health is hardly moving.  (A DRIUD for God's sake!)  I get her to half life, and I'm about a bubble down, but my mana is so low that all I have left is room to gate.<br>
<br>
After some tells I learn that she has resists of at least 120 is ALL categories.  Whether that was true or not, she should have been charred hippie long before I reached 40mana.  She said I was the only caster who she hasn't killed and who actually managed to hurt her.  Woopy.  What a complement from someone 5 levels lower.  (A DRUID for God's sake!)<br>
<br>
So, Aerimus, I figured my damage was being cut by about 80%.  If this was a warrior with such resists, what could I have done but gated earlier?  Lures do not apply, I'm too low of a level.  Even if they did, check the casting time.<br>
<br>
As I said, if someone doesn't have huge resist gear, chances are they're going to die.  That's why I have no problem with the damage nerf.  But I ask again:<br>
<br>
Where are the items/gear that will resist warrior damage?  Why can't I get a Dodge skill +200 ring?  How about a riposte spell?  Oh wait... that would get resisted.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ullyapakadeabn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llyap aka Deabn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/22/02 3:00:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> The resist gear at lower levels</span><hr size=1> The two main differences between ac gear and resist gear for these pvp encounters are:<br>

2. AC gear only drops dps, resist gear drops total doable damage.<br>
<br>
Perhaps resisted spells in pvp at pre lure levels should only use mana for the damage done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=23.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=23.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=23.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=23.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=23.topic&start=101&stop=114>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showPrevMessage?topicID=23.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showNextMessage?topicID=23.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.emailToFriend?topicID=23.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.threadControl?topicID=23.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
