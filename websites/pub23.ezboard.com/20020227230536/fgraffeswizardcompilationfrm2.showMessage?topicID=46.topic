Being a Dark Elf with &quot;indifferent&quot; faction with the outpost in The Overthere I didn't want to risk doing much fighting except to save my hide.<br><br>The closest I ever got to the jail area was when a group I was talking to got to the hand room and was staying there to fight.  Figuring on joining them I decided to try the little Gravity Flux trick to get up the wall.  Having tried this before, I didn't remember being able to move forward that much once I was launched in the air...and the moat is pretty wide.<br><br>Hence, I swam up to the castle wall and started casting.  I hadn't even finished casting and some decayed prisoners and guards started hitting me through the castle wall.  I was down to a bubble of health before my casting was even complete.<br><br>This leads to my question:  Is there a way to get a better run at moving while in the air?  I sure didn't remember moving all that much when I tried it on dry land...even with JBoots I would start running when the spell hit and I didn't seem to get far enough to cross the moat in Karnor's Castle.<br><br>Any hints would be greatly appreciated.  Even without a group I could probably sit in the hand room and rest assuming only the hands were there...they are all indifferent to me.<br><br><br>Nitewave Mojomaster<br>Level 45 Dark Elf Wizard<br>Clan of One<br>Bristlebane <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nitewavemojomaster>Nitewave Mojomaster</A> at: 10/2/00 8:25:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugarash.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Garash</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/2/00 10:24:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: give me a push:  Gravity Flux in Karnor's Castle</span><hr size=1> The way I did this bottle was solo!

My advice if you are going to do it like we did - run like hell, don't get lost on your way back to the zone after you are done. (i know its not far, but i kept wanting to take a wrong turn)  And like he said, SoW, invis, steelskin, and levi - levi so you can jump down on your mad dash back, instead of working your way down the stairs.

I was surprised at how easy it was with the little guy.  Many people were kind enough to buff me up before going in.  It's amazing the things people give to you as a lvl 7 rogue in Karnor's.  But I went in and got my vial of swirling somke here with almost no problem once I figured out what I was doing.  I ran in, the skellie was up.  I activated my Shiny Brass Idol (which btw has no casting time, I was worried it might)  and handed in the bottle then jumped off the wall to make my corpse retrieval easier.  I probably could have made it to the zone, but I didn't want to train all the nice people that had buffed me up earlier.  So I'm happy to say I got my scroll of concussion and it is one of my most prized possessions.  I definately reccommend the rogue method over suicide runs  to the jail.  Yeah it's cheap, but as long as you're playing the rogue you're still finishing the quest.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Good luck all, I hope this helps.<br><br>-Hipp <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udurrel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Durrel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/1/00 2:59:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogue in Karnors and the shiny brass idol</span><hr size=1> I got my bottle when we were camping the Hand room but I just wanted to post to say that the GF trick can work....i was fighting way to hand room once and i fell off and the last platform before you get to hand room..it took me awhile but you just need to find the shortest path to the tower get a little run right before you GF and you should be able to make....it takes some time to do it but it can be done....Good luck<br><br>Durrel <br>51 Wizard <br>Saryrn<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umagatone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Magatone</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/1/00 8:21:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: give me a push:  Gravity Flux in Karnor's Castle</span><hr size=1> Ok, to make a flying leap with g-flux you have to be a bit lucky and channel the spell.  You stand on the path where it indicates on the map and face the wall.  Have jboots on (you probably don't really need them but it can't hurt) and keep your MR low so you don't resist your spell.  Just *before* the spell goes off (like a pixle or 2 of the purple Casting bar is still there) start running toward the wall.  If your channeling goes off (the &quot;You regain your concentration and continue casting...&quot; thing) and you don't resist the spell, you'll go flying over the moat and land on the path.  If you resist or your spell is interrupted, quickly turn around and swim back to the shore and try again.  That was the method I used anyway, and it seemed to work out well.  I landed in the moat a couple times at first because channeling didn't go off, but nothing agroed as I swam back to shore (and I'm an Erudite who's very KoS to VS).  <br><br>P.S.  Yes, you can hand in the bottle while the shiny brass idol effect is up. <p>Magatone Brac'Taur<BR>Wizard of the 47th rank<BR>Ambassador of Merchants of Honour<BR>Rallos Zek</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umagatone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Magatone</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 12/1/00 8:22:15 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uqinadann.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qinadann</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/1/00 1:37:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: give me a push:  Gravity Flux in Karnor's Castle</span><hr size=1> If you want, instead of running just use angle down so you'll face the ground about 35degree and use gflux.
