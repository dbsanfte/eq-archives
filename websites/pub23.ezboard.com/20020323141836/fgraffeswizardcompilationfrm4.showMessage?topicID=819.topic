It is over camped by Druids and Wizards alike.<br>
<br>
But when a certain female wizard repeatedly goes out of her way to pull her unsnared or partially snared quad over you and over you, I can see why people dislike quaders.<br>
<br>
Then when the agroed wyverns she ran over the sitting wizard and start attacking you, almost killing you before you manage to channel a gate off.  Then remembering you bound in CS after the last raid bind you did.  Still holding agro.  So you run off to mem a gfay gate to clear agro.  As the wyverns close ini on you.<br>
<br>
The female erudite wizard starts yelling in zone who keeps stealing my wyverns.<br>
<br>
People need to learn to be considerate of others.  Do not pull over resting people.  If they are in a bad spot ask them to please move.  Do not repeatedly (when they move out of your way after the first time) continue to run them over and over as you group you wyverns.<br>
<br>
/Rant off.<br>
<br>
How many times should you let a person not in your group almost get you killed by repeatedly running there out of control quad over you before you do somthing about it?<br>
<br>
What should a wizard do?<br>
<br>
Petition them?<br>
<br>
Take the kill, &quot;Your wyverns attacked me and you did nothing about it, you brought them and dropped them off at me reapeatedly, I had to defend myself.&quot;?<br>
<br>
She ran me out of CS three times Wednesday night.  I am tired of having to run from someone elses kills.<br>
I got out with between 15 and 200 hp each time.  <br>

<br>
Maybe its their high base Int that attracts a certain type of player, maybe not.  But I have been trained more by erudite wizards, seen more poor nuking and aggro management by erudite wizards, and seen more ignorance about wizard abilities by erudite wizards than any other demographic.  No offense to all the excellent Erudite wizards out there, - and there are many.  It's just that if there is such a thing as a Wizard twink, chances are it is an Erudite, because even a cretin knows that Erudites have the highest base int and therefore must be the best wizard class.  Give me someone who chose their class what what it is, and not on the basis of one stat, any day of the week.<br>

I am not KoS.  I am considered warmly.  I was ally at one point.  I helped a friend who got jumped by the name wyvern, and one who got jumped by the named drake.  Before that I was ally, now I am warmly.<br>
<br>
But, Faction has nothing to do when you are sitting and agroed wyverns come running over you and the puller gets out of range.<br>
<br>
Agroed Mobs and a sitting wizard are a bad combination.  I make sure I do not pull over sitting people.  I avoid others pulls so I do not cross agro on them.  I just wish others would do the same.<br>
<br>
And annualing her mobs would not do much when they are attacking me and they are not snared yet.<br>
<br>
Even though this is a Rant board, my post it was against the one particular wizard and everyone class/race reguardless that goes no respect to others when they pull, or do this on purpose.<br>

The list below is sort of off the top of my head but I have seen just such a list and I think its this type of list that some will look at to choose the race that goes the best with there class.<br>

Druids:halflings<br>
<br>
Clerics:Highelves<br>
<br>
Bards:Halfelves, Woodelves<br>
<br>
Wizards:Erudites<br>
<br>
Warriors: This is a weird one because there is faction that most will take into account, if you're worried about faction then it's Barbarians if not Trolls(for the regen)<br>
<br>
Enchanters:Erudites,Humans<br>
<br>
Rogues:Halflings<br>

Shamans:Barbarians<br>

Paladin:High elves,Halfelves(not too sure why Halfevles but they seem to be alot out there)<br>
<br>
Rangers:Woodelves, Halfelves<br>
<br>
ShadowKnights: Darkelves,Trolls<br>
<br>
Sad but you will see asses of thses races more then most because a percent of players out there will look to get the maxium out of there time so they need the best suited race for there class....too bad they never heard of &quot;playing what you like&quot;...Me? I chose a Dark elf for my Wizard soley because I like the idea of a dark but powerful Wizard, not because of a few stats.<br>
<br>
And on a side note....if you med on the rocks or any elevated place there is a good chance a player will not see you till there right on top of you ...Im sure we have all seen it...running and all of a sudden a player pops up right in front of you  , like they just zone or gated in but the've been there for some time....Im not trying to give this person that a leg up but it has happen, even to me and im VERY careful to watch out for others but it will happen...once you tell them where you are that should never happen again unless there person is a jerk then it will keep happening till you /petition them or leave.<br>
<br>
<br>
Please understand that Im not saying if you choose the class/race i have listed you're an ass..Im just talking about the ones that can't play there class right and have VERY little respect for other players like the person in the original post talked of...he/she is an Erudite Wizard and a badly played one at that..are all Erudite Wizards bad players?...of course not but we know that even the bad players will choose this class/race combo to be a better player when what really matters is how we treat one another and no race/class combo is going to help them there, if you're an ass your an ass..nothing is going to change that...Sorry for the long post everyone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrindel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grindel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/8/02 11:12:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=819.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/grindel/elminster.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard giving us a bad rep!</span><hr size=1> Hmm you misunderstand.

Sucks.<br>
<br>
Know what's even dumber? The haunted seachest. It's difficult (not impossible) to kill it underwater because when you stop to cast a spell (to root it), your toon is still moving while trying to slow down and your spell gets interrupted. By the time you've completely stopped, you're getting your ass chewed out already.<br>
<br>
So that's why I used pull to shore, right where the water and land meets. It's away from the otter camp and there's NOTHING around. I'm sitting there, medding up while it's being root/dotted. What I HATE is that people will run up to it (gee, a seachest? Where did it come from?) and get aggroed and then proceed to fight it. I'll say that it's mine and to please leave it be only to get retorts that they got aggroed and were fighting back (wtf? it was rooted) or I'll be yelled at for &quot;training&quot; them by bringing it to shore (wtf? it's rooted).<br>
<br>
If you're sitting nearby and root breaks, it's gonna head to you, I'm sorry. I will make amends by healing you up and buffing/sowing you along with a sincere apology.<br>
<br>
Shame that it's such a small zone that people get trained upon. When quadding, it's the puller's responsiblity to QUAD where people aren't sitting because you are dragging your mobs through the zone. If someone is soloing something in one spot, leave them damn well enough alone. It's your responsiblity to make sure you don't aggro yourself and claim it was their fault when they didn't pull it to you to begin with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucovenantu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Covenant U</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/8/02 12:35:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=819.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard giving us a bad rep!</span><hr size=1> I'm an erudite wizard who has spent most of the last few levels in CS quadding.  I am KOS to CoV.  I also am only recently guilded.  All of this should be taken into consideration, I suppose, in reading my response.<br>
<br>
First off, I think the same numbers game applied to halfling druids applies here.  Probably more erudite wizards out there and therefore higher proportion of idiots.   As to why most are erudite, sure, I assume the base intelligence has alot to do with it.  Is it really important?  No, I'd have probably done a DE for Ultravision if I were remaking today (why erudites are dark blind and live in the darkest place in all Norrath always made me laugh), but years ago when I started my Toon if you were rolling up a character, erudites just kind of looked to be the &quot;best&quot; fit for wizards.   Like regen for warriors, base mana (particularly before the advent of twinking with int jewelry) was considered a big issue for casting.   I also think most folks are twinking now, and erudite is a pretty narrow race as far as melee and hybrids go, so it's largely an unknown class for those who don't play casters.  Twinking is often about variety, and folks therefore may be more likely to start an erudite based on novelty. <br>
<br>
As for CoV faction, I wouldn't want to be non-KOS there for quadding.  Let's face it, it's a dense zone.  My strategy is simply put up diamond skin and run through a pack of Wyverns.  I run 'em down to the beach, Atols and there ya go.   I never bothered with the Flux Staff, mostly because I hate SolA.   I NEVER med afk in CS.  Never.  Not even on the beach.   Even if I did want better CoV, it's pretty tough to get it solo.  You really need to do named in Kael and that's not a great place for a pickup group.  So alot of folks are KOS CoV by design or through no fault of their own.<br>
<br>
As for quadding, if I'm relying on guessing someone's faction to determine how safe my pull is, I'm an inconsiderate ass.  I always assume pulling four Wyverns is dangerous, to me and everyone else around me (i.e., I assume everyone is KOS).<br>
<br>
Toward that end I never pull over anyone (unless they cross my pull on purpose), even when I know I've built up so much aggro it's probably impossible they'll start in on another PC.  Why?  Cause shit happens, you can go LD, you may need to zone, etc, etc.   So even if someone sits to med in the middle of the land bridge (which is rather irritating) I try to get the beasties on the beach asap.  So I'm sorry, the issue of how inconsiderate this wizard is has little to do with whether the victim was KOS or not or should be hunting there. <br>
<br>
Finally, in all my time quadding there on my server, I'm afraid it's been the little doggies that have cause me personally the most trouble.  Frequently they pull the Bulthars or Sirens up the bridge, or pull otters into my AE, through ignorance or laziness I don't know.  I've also been killed on purpose there by a druid while medding at the otter vendors.  I guess this thread just proves that no class is immune to having inconsiderate idiots in its ranks, and considerate quadding is even tougher than regular quadding, which aint easy to begin with.  <br>

44-46 doing frost giant scouts and berserkers in GD will just about take you to Dubious on its own. At 55, though, it would be horrible, as it's all green. You don't need to be doing the most badass stuff in KD, though, to get big faction hits. One extended arena raid doing any sort of storm giants should take you to non-KOS immediately. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uikeya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ikeya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Ikeya != Chick</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/8/02 1:50:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=819.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard giving us a bad rep!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Are you training them?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I know no wyverns, even the named ones, will attack you if you are just sitting there medding and aren't KOS. If you aggro one, then sit, you are asking for it anyway. If you are fighting wyverns or drakes on the beach and someone kites by you, yes they are social creatures and will jump in to help. I almost killed a necro like that. (Sorry again). Sometimes the little dips and valleys on the beach hide people until you are right on them. I always try and turn and run the other way. I don't quad on the cliff, some do, but I've aggroed Yvolcarn and Azz too many times dragging their friends past them. But, I'll say it again for emphasis, no wyverns or drakes will attack you if you aren't KOS and are just medding.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucursim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cursim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/9/02 8:18:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=819.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Don't be so down on Erudites</span><hr size=1> My Wizard was created a year ago (Tomorrow is his birthday), as my first &quot;real&quot; character (I tried a Mage and a Necro as a total newb the day I got the game). I made him an Erudite because I like the INT bonus. And I played him like a hardcore newb back then. Now, I'm level 26 (Casual player), and I'm MUCH better at it. I can manage aggro well, I know how many nukes to use in a fight, and I can solo fairly well. <br>
<br>
I do get frustrated sometimes during my bad moments (RL problems affect my in game attitude), but overall I'm far from a n00b.<br>
<br>
Not all ERU wizard's are bad. Just the really lowbie or obviously PLed ones.<br>

Why bind in CS? Did you forget that you have a gate to there?<br>

Anyways, she keeps doing that I'd drag the whole group across her and let her deal with hers and your pull.
