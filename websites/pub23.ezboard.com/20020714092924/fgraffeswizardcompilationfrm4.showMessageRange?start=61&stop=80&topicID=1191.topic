Rhombus, Sam, Froz, etc. all believe their damage output is more than sufficient.  What's the point of &quot;balancing&quot; them?<br>
<br>
If caster balancing is intended to have any impact whatsoever (other than inspiring the current tableau of &quot;whiny lowbies&quot; vs. &quot;uber-in-blinders&quot;) it really should affect the group that has consitently complained: pre-60 wizards with average equipment.  As has been stated previously, it makes NO sense for a 50+ wizard to use pre-40 spells just to take advantage of level 2 focus.  <br>
<br>
Let me quickly restate something: no one is asking to be handed anything.  No one wants level 3 foci with uber stats dropping off orc pawns like candy, but is it really unreasonable to want 50+ camps with REASONABLE drop rates that can be done by one group and result in foci with crappy (or no) stats?  The uberguild cry for appropriate risk vs. reward would be satisfied and the casual gamer would gain a much-needed boost to group efficiency. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/upalaziousfrydaddy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palazious Frydaddy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/8/02 3:14:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1191.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well...</span><hr size=1> Thats kinda my observations about the caster balance.<br>
<br>
~Before Luclin Situation~<br>
<br>
60 Wizards w/ bells and whistles felt they didnt need balancing.  Nuke robes rock!<br>
<br>
&lt; 60 Wizard were the ones who needed an upgrade.<br>
<br>
~Luclin came out - NEW NUKES!!!~<br>
<br>
All I'm going to do is laugh at this one.<br>
<br>
~Luclin came out - Enter the FT Items ~<br>
<br>
60 Wizards w/ bells and whistles found that their crack team of 4-8 balanced groups could take on mobs and fill their satchels with FT Items.  Even get up to 19FT+ off of what they consider 'easy' encounters.<br>
<br>
&lt;60 wizards who could scrape up maybe 30 people to raid with, levels 50-60 could not do these encounters and where left with doing the Shawl quest for FT1 and later when Cazic Opened saw that there was some FT3 boots that was actually possible for them.  Out of those not in the tier1-2 guilds on my server I know of 2 60 wizards who have these.  Only seen one for sell....laff.<br>
<br>
Result: The 60 wizards w/bells and whistles grew stronger.  The Wizards who need the upgrade got little.<br>
<br>
~ Enter Mage Focus Items ~<br>
<br>
60 W/ all the bells and whistle are with mages handing these out from the moment they get on.  They'll always have a mage available. <br>
<br>
&lt;60 wizard - Seeks out Mage.  Hopes the mage decides to play in their guild that day so they have these items.  Or is force to 'create a corpse' every time they log to save the items.  Hell, I'm level 60 in a guild who at optimum raid time might have 35 54-60 level members on.  Several times we raid without mage items for the simple fact is one of our 4 mages arent on.<br>
<br>
~Result~<br>
<br>
60 Wizards w/ bells and whistles became even more powerful.<br>
<br>
&lt;60 Wizards became more powerful if they were lucky or decided to go beg for mage items. /shrug I don't feel like I should beg to help balance me.<br>
<br>
~Enter Focus Items ~<br>
<br>
8 items that TRULY will help balance us... the damage/mana items.  Ya, its nice to save portal fragments.  Ya, its nice to cast faster... but to balance us we need 'more damage' and 'mana efficiency'.<br>
<br>
2 of the 4 damage items are CoV faction.  There are 3 guilds on our server who are capable of these encounters and dont have to worry about faction any more...maybe 20 wizards total, if that. I'm sure they have them already.  1 of the items requires a drop from Gore. Our guild is almost capable of gore.. just lacking a few more damage dealers, havent seen one yet though. The last is out of Cazic, probably by far the most obtainable.  I love this zone, spend a lot of time there... still dont have a cap tho. =p<br>
Pretty much have to be level 60 to succeed in here tho so not obtainable for the 44-55 crowd.<br>
<br>
~Net Result on Damage Focus~<br>
<br>
60 Wizards w/ bells and whistles log on to find stuff from their last ToV raid having Damage3 or maybe they wont destroy that item the next time they visit their. They will gain more from this.<br>
<br>
&lt;60 wizards will see some of the 60 wizards getting the cazic drop and even a couple (55-60 ) might see the hide from gore and will be able to do the quest...doesnt do much for the 44-55 crowd at all tho. Some will gain.<br>
<br>
~Net Result on Mana Focus~<br>
<br>
I dont see a problem with most wizards being able to obtain this.  Would have been better to see this on a good piece of equiptment or even thurg quest armor if its to benefit the 44-60 crowd.  Tie =p<br>
<br>
**Total net result**<br>
<br>
The 20-30 wizards in the guilds that can do the high-end encounters have benefited from all these upgrades.  Hell, its easy for them, just ask them.  So the group of wizards who didnt need the upgrade recieved all of them making them more powerful and set back from the fact that for a lot of wizards the gap widens.  Melee upgrades still drop like candy and are easily passed down.  Even reavers - 40/40 ratio are 10-15k on our server and dropping making it obtainable by the mid-40s melees, let alone younger wizards having to compete with this kind of damage.<br>
<br>
The &lt; 60 or 60 wizards like myself pretty much are relying on the mage items for balance.  Some might have up to FT4 and some might have the mana regen focus.  The caster balance has pretty much missed the 44-59-low 60 crowd.<br>
<br>
Yes, lots of wizards come here to vent their frustration at the lack of the caster balance.  <br>
<br>
Look at the numbers on Armok's chart.  The only item that will raise the bar might be the mage focus items... and wizards wont always have them available.  Meanwhile the high-end wizards power has grown a lot... I'm sure that when he runs the numbers and re-graphs the chart this will be obvious.<br>
<br>
Yes, the vents sometimes become out of control a bit.  Hell, these wizards that need the balancing have pretty much been shit on.  They come here to vent and are told 'your a newb' or 'you suck' or the 'burrower is easy and any gimp guild can do it'...<br>
<br>
..and my favorite, work harder so you can join a tier one guild and get this stuff.. you dont work hard enough and therefore don't deserve this.<br>
<br>
Hell, you want the easy way? Join a tier one guild.  It works...hell, my best friend did just that.  Of course, most encounters are so easy that it doesnt matter if she nukes or not, it won't make any difference in the outcome of the fight.<br>
<br>
Hell, she's bored to death because not much is a challenge anymore.  She's even quit playing most of the time because of this and yet has far better equipment then those who spend much more time then her seeing if they can take the next level of mobs.<br>
<br>
This is working hard to 'earn' your items? Laff..<br>
<br>
Maybe those who were in on the first floor when the guild started and worked their ass off to get it to tier one deserve the 'work hard' plaque.  And believe me... these people have my utmost respect and always will.<br>
<br>
But joining a tier one guild has nothing to with working hard at all....just the opposite.<br>
<br>
To those people who are in the 44- &lt; 60 range, they have recieved little, no matter how much work they put in.<br>
<br>
To those people who are in the tier one guilds, grats on the bonus.<br>
<br>
But take the time to listen to your younger piers and those who are not in the tier one guild.  These should be the people that the Rombus's are looking out for.<br>
<br>
If that doesn't happen then there will continue to be a widening gap in the war against the select few and the masses.<br>
<br>
Something that is happening to a greater extent everytime we come to the boards.<br>
<br>
After talking with a lot of fellow wizards on my server I have really good stuff.  Full ToV armor, epic, level 60, 7th shawl, 255 int, plenty of mana, etc. No sunstrike though despite 5 months of active auctioning, killing mass guardians in SF, dragons, checking with the local MB team on a weekly basis, enough Protectors to get dizzy.<br>
<br>
On raids I rock pretty well, In an exp group with c3 and bard I rock pretty well.  If these arent available at the time my damage output dives to an embarrassing level, especially in a fast pull group.  Hell, if I have to use fire then my damage isnt much better then level 51 when I got draught of fire. lol<br>

We do get a lot of help from the tier 1 guilds on our server as they are always there for advice, rooting you on, or even letting you tag along to experience a mob so you can take that knowledge back to your guild.<br>
<br>
So I would say on quellious we are very lucky to have this.<br>

And I do learn some from the Rombus's on this board, even when they rant sometimes, about the progressions and direction to take the guild.<br>

I just wish the focus was on this rather then a constant fight in most of the threads.<br>
<br>
And this is where the Rombus's could really show their knowledge and assist younger wizards in playing a better game.<br>
<br>
Besides, we all know that wizards make the best leaders <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Namely the Kunark dragon type mobs, as we need to get good at these before we can move to the vindi/velks type mobs.<br>
<br>
But these kinda mobs are very scarce and usually not up during the time that we have our 35 raiders on.<br>

We grow, get better, and have a blast.<br>

They do not help casters that really need more power to be more balanced.<br>
<br>
The only conclusion possible is that they were not ment to be part of caster balancing.<br>
They are only intended to make loot more interesting for casters that can get them.<br>
<br>
This only becomes a problem if perhaps a lv58 caster complains about not being powerful enough and that he cant do enough dmg in groups.<br>
If someone mentions the items upgraded in last patch and tells him that it´s possible for him to be more powerful now.<br>
Then that person is a complete idiot.<br>
<br>
The worst possible situation would of course be if VI includes these items when they look at the power of casters like him and decides how much improvement is needed to balance them.<br>

I understand exactly what your saying because I've read it before. yes, the same arguments happened on Stormhammer when players (like you) didnt get vulak loot off orc pawns and then left the server (kinda like you leaving your wiz) crying how lousy the server was.  you see, they realized they still had to work for loot and /gasp it was harder now since there was no spoiler site to tell them what to do.<br>
<br>
you dont want to do ntov but think you still deserve the loot right? You deserve nothing. VI owes you nothing for 12.95 or 39.95. All they do is provide the oppertunity to you. You make those choices on what lvl you play and where you raid. do not blame anyone else for your choices like you are doing to us.<br>
<br>
youre acting like a whinny, spoiled, premadonna. You need to get a clue that this (focus items thing) is not done. additionaly, get off your &quot;I deserve it&quot; high horse and realize that you still have to work for your drops.<br>
<br>
guess what? I dont even wear the lvl3 effect items I have. Why? they are crap, they sat in the bank for a reason and some cheesy effect of summoning 3 or range 3 is not going to make me pull them out.<br>
<br>
I will never spend 40k plat for a spider fur cap when I can bum a focus bracer for free on a raid. I will never spend 50k plat on a Oblus death shroud. why? Its not worth it and the foci are not the end all be all.<br>
<br>
btw, how many times are you going to leave Gor? <p><br><br>

One problem with your... erm... theory: it's easier for a pre-60s in a decent guild to get focus items than it is for a level 60 Wizard in an &quot;uber&quot; guild.<br>
<br>
Damage 3<br>
White Dragonscale Cloak - We don't kill Gorenaire, last kill was over 8 months ago.<br>
Jungle Spider Fur Cap - Obtainable by a group of 6.<br>
Mask of the Dragon Slayer - We don't kill Yelinak anymore, last kill was over 5 months ago.<br>
Harla Dar's Talisman - We don't have Western Waste raids, last raid was almost a year ago.<br>
<br>
Range 3<br>
Supple Scale Armband - I can't remember the last time I was in a Karnor's hands room group.<br>
Square Helm - Single group can get this by playing deep in Skyshrine.<br>
Drachnid Thyxl - I guess I could solo this guy if he was up, but a group of mid-40s has a better chance at getting this item then I do.<br>
Cryosilk Sash - Again, can't remember the last time we raided fair.<br>
<br>
Mana Preservation 3<br>
Obulus Death Shroud - Sebilis pls.<br>
Nevederia's Left Eye - Lady Nev, easier for me to obtain.<br>
SkyWatcher's Monocle - Lord Fesh, easier for me to obtain.<br>
Crystaline Torque - Some mob in Velketors... I think?<br>
<br>
Reagent Conservation 3<br>
All easy for anyone to obtain.<br>
<br>
Spell Haste 3<br>
Essence Lens - ST Key + Prismatic Scale (uber rare drop from ST named)... we never do ST anymore.<br>
Frostreaver's Embroidered Cloak - Who is &quot;Frostreaver?&quot;  I know who he is but the last time we killed him was... a very long time ago. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Not to mention the fact that it's dropable.<br>
Valtron's Necklace of Wonder - 2 maybe 3 on Povar... this isn't even obtainable by the most &quot;uber&quot; anymore.<br>
Hand of the Mastery - Aaryonar, easier for me to obtain.<br>
<br>
So a whole 3 maybe 4 focus items are easier for me to obtain and most of them sit in the mana preservation 3 area. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uraufaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raufaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 4:02:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1191.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I wish...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Of course Sam doesnt need balanced, He's retired.<br>

Oh, please.  First of all, NO ONE is asking to be handed anything.  Some people want foci that are reasonable for the casual gamer (the person who tends to feel underpowered) to obtain.  A statless FI with a reasonable (maybe a guaranteed drop off a 4-hr triggered spawn) drop rate that requires a single group to camp, or a questable FI that can be obtained after a week of 2-hr logins really isn't too much to ask considering this is Verant's method of caster balancing.

There is also a problem with focus items and endgame bosses.<br>
I think that the items they drop should have unique focus effects more powerful than focus3.<br>
That would be reasonable.<br>
<br>
I think that a player that are lv51-59 and willing to work hard for it should be able to get a focus3 item.<br>
Thats impossible or almost impossible now.<br>
<br>
It´s probably true that people that can get focus3 items and are satisfied with them are lv60 players in medium strong guilds.<br>

Both high-end players and the lv51-59 crowd have good reasons to be disappointed.<br>

I never said that anyone wanted them handed to them. My point was simply that these items, while maybe not great to someone of Rombus' stature, were great items without a focus effect and just as hard to get. BTW, in case you didnt know, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I Am a casual player</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and  I dont see them as that hard to get.

Bully for you, but not everyone can put 2-3 groups together.  I'm suggesting a quest that can be done in a week of 2-hour logins (there are plenty of people who are limited to 2 hrs/night at most) or a reasonable drop rate at a single-group camp, both resulting in a statless (or nearly so) FI.  It's not too much to ask.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Again, and Rombus hit it right on the head, A level 51- 59 CAN get a lvl 3 item. They cant get any of them they chose, but they CAN get 1 from each of 4 that matter to wizards.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
51-59 wizards can get a FI from three groups.  Maybe.  If they're lucky.  Not everyone can put a CT or Skyshrine group together, or wait for a Seb group and then hold it long enough to get a Shroud.  If you have 2-3 hrs/night to play your chances of getting a level 3 FI are pretty fucking slim.  <br>
<br>
Again, a questable FI isn't too much to ask.  If someone is willing to put the time in to get one, they should be able to get one even if that time isn't expended in a single session. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urombusmindspire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Moderator</font></td></tr></table><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Verant's #1 Fanboy</font></td></tr></table><br><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif><a href=mailto:rombus@graffe.com style=text-decoration: none><font color=#FFFFFF>Contact Rombus</font></a></font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 9:46:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1191.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/sidepic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I wish...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 51-59 wizards can get a FI from three groups.

It as nothing to do with being lucky, it has to do with being patient and camping it.  Do you think level 60s magically get groups and when they get groups the focus loot rains from the sky?  LoL!  There are like 2-3 Nev's Left Eyes in my guild and maybe 6 Skywatcher's Monocles... we've been doing ToVN for a very long time.  Nice try but your logic is very flawed.  Oh, as far as &quot;from 3 groups&quot; there's actually more but I only listed the three groups that are important to a Wizard - haste, mana preservation and range (not very important unless your soloing though).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Not everyone can put a CT or Skyshrine group together<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
They can't?  Is there some kind of law/code preventing you from gathering friends or random strangers?  The spider camp sits right at the portal, max pull is 3 and all are mezzable.  They can drop the Spider Fur hat.  As far as a Skyshrine group, it's the same thing.  Might I also add that the focus item from Skyshrine is a Range 3 item.  Other range 3 items that would probably be better for a Wizard stat-wise can be obtained via the Hands room in Karnors (a logical place for a 51-55 to group) or via the Dread Widow in Dreadlands (easy for a 44-60 to obtain).  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> or wait for a Seb group and then hold it long enough to get a Shroud.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Two things are being accomplished here though.  You have the gain of EXP and the camping.  I don't get what your complaint here is... you have to camp a focus item?  Oh no!  Really, what's the logic behind this argument?  Might I also add that the shroud is fairly common and can be purchased.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you have 2-3 hrs/night to play your chances of getting a level 3 FI are pretty fucking slim.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, where is the logic in this?  You say you that &quot;NO ONE is asking to be handed anything&quot; but then you complain because you have to do work to get these items.  You say that it's unreasonable that they don't give you focus items that are easy to obtain by casual players, yet they have.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> A statless FI with a reasonable (maybe a guaranteed drop off a 4-hr triggered spawn) drop rate that requires a single group to camp, or a questable FI that can be obtained after a week of 2-hr logins really isn't too much to ask considering this is Verant's method of caster balancing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Uhh.. no offense, but did you check out where these items drop?  That's why the Cazic Helm, Obulus Mantle, Supple Scale Armband and Drachnid Thyxl exhist.  They're reasonable camps that have a decent drop rate.  <br>
<br>
Really man, what more do you want?  The triggered mob idea wouldn't work because you'd have the &quot;power gamers&quot; killing him at every pop (remember the Oracle in OOT?).  The quest one is a decent idea and something you'll probably see in the future.  Focus items also may be added to quest items already in the game as well.<br>

Also, if they're level 60 they can get manaburn and organize a burn crew like many other casual gamers have done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uraufaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raufaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/12/02 12:58:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1191.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I wish...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It as nothing to do with being lucky, it has to do with being patient and camping it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Please don't try to misdirect this.  If you only have 2-3 hours/night, organizing a group to camp an item isn't always possible.  When the items are rare drops, that 2-3 hours is fairly meaningless.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Do you think level 60s magically get groups and when they get groups the focus loot rains from the sky? LoL! There are like 2-3 Nev's Left Eyes in my guild and maybe 6 Skywatcher's Monocles... we've been doing ToVN for a very long time. Nice try but your logic is very flawed. Oh, as far as &quot;from 3 groups&quot; there's actually more but I only listed the three groups that are important to a Wizard - haste, mana preservation and range (not very important unless your soloing though).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Thank you for misrepresenting my position.  In this case it's your logic that's very flawed since I never stated that 60th wizards magically get groups or that drop rates increase when they do.  I did, however, say that the majority of pointful wizard foci are available to 60th wizards because they tend to be in higher end guilds.  Sounds fairly reasonable, no?<br>
<br>
The &quot;three groups&quot; comment was in response to Castwell's comment about all four groups being available to all wizards.  According to your own table that isn't true so this shouldn't require any more discussion.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Two things are being accomplished here though. You have the gain of EXP and the camping. I don't get what your complaint here is... you have to camp a focus item? Oh no! Really, what's the logic behind this argument? Might I also add that the shroud is fairly common and can be purchased.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That was a beautiful straw man.  The only group that has a complaint at this point is the group of casual gamers with only 2-3 hours to play in a given night.  Finding a seb group can take a good share of that time, time that might be better spent quadding if you're looking for XP.  Add to that the fact that the chance of getting a shroud in an hour of camping is vanishingly small...I'm sure you get the point by now.<br>
<br>
As to it being purchasable...have you seen the going rate for an ODS since the patch?  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Again, where is the logic in this? You say you that &quot;NO ONE is asking to be handed anything&quot; but then you complain because you have to do work to get these items. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm asking that casual gamers be able to spread their work efficiently over multiple sessions or be able to camp something secure in the knowledge that they won't have to do it over and over again with no result.  Incidentally, this isn't about me at all.  I have no need for FIs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You say that it's unreasonable that they don't give you focus items that are easy to obtain by casual players, yet they have.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And yet you have people saying that it's difficult for them to obtain them.  Before you accuse these people of laziness, keep in mind that many of them have played more or less religiously for what little time they have to get a character to a respectable level.  If it were possible for them to do this, they would.  The truth is that camping for FIs requires a good deal of time that can't be efficiently spread over several days or weeks.  Organizing/finding a group in some of these zones can take a good share of any 2-3 hour session.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> My point was that my guild, like many guilds level 60 Wizards are in, don't typically kill Gore. It doesn't matter if it's &quot;more accessible&quot; to me if we don't kill the mob.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I understood your point completely, but are you really saying that Triton wouldn't organize a Gore raid if you asked and it would help you?  You could even offer to allow other guilds to loot the other drops if you'd feel guilty over taking such an easy kill.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Really man, what more do you want? The triggered mob idea wouldn't work because you'd have the &quot;power gamers&quot; killing him at every pop (remember the Oracle in OOT?). The quest one is a decent idea and something you'll probably see in the future. Focus items also may be added to quest items already in the game as well.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A triggered mob would probably work quite well if the resulting FI were NODROP, Rec. level: 51 and nearly statless.  If it's SO EASY to camp CT and Seb, why would &quot;power gamers&quot; bother with an item they can't sell or use?<br>

<br>
I know plenty of casual gamers who don't have the time to camp FIs but would really like to.  As I said before, I'm not worried about 60th wizards with enough time to get manaburn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1191.topic&start=141&stop=143>8</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1191.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1191.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1191.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=1191.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=1191.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1191.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1191.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
