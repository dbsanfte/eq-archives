But the Druids of Jaggedpine and their ilk were no better than those stiff-necked cretins who served Mithaniel Marr. Or Innoruk. Or Soulsek Ro.<br><br>Stiff necked? Perhaps he was being overly harsh with them in his mind. Passion meant predisposition, and Istark was a man who strove to keep his passions in check, lest it rule him completely. The one true vestige of his training with Carnalspirit which served him every day. He had seen his beloved master buckle slowly under the pressures of existence, most of which were self-inflicted. He would not do the same.<br><br>Not stiff-necked, then. Foolish and weak ... yes. They sought refuge from those stresses underneath the shelter of their gods. Dominion meant ultimate power laying with another. Even his fellow wizards who served Soulsek Ro were doing little more than assigning a zenith for their own progression; a point in which their ascension would stop, and they would be either static, or in decline. To exist in decline is to exist in a state longing for purpose. Istark Kirtan would never allow himself to exist as such. He would seek the knowledge with which to grasp every rung of power possible, and where he found none --where he ultimately reached the wall at which mortals were meant to supplicate themselves before turning back and falling into that sad, graceless descent to ultimate oblivion-- he would begin picking away at that wall. He would break the way through, and would ultimately teach even the gods themselves to give him wide berth.<br><br>He held out a hand, fingers splayed and power playing  in bluish arcs between them. &quot;So then...burn...&quot; he intoned, lyric baritone bottoming out now into the lower registers as he uttered what was not actually needed for him anymore, but what amounted to something he did out of pure ...vanity, perhaps? Had he grown vain? Or did he simply need to hear his own voice from time to time, as if to remind himself that he was not like them. To cement his own reality and disassociate it from that which they painted him to be.<br><br>The bodies of the two druidfolk, laying entangled in one another's death throes, burst into flame which traversed the line, through hot and then white-hot, until even the power of the Sun itself was brought to mind. Others would find it difficult to look upon the conflagration at that precise moment when it ionized the bodies of his fallen enemies; Istark did not flinch. He watched it all, until the fires subsided and then vanished, leaving no evidence that the bodies had ever been there, save for the sickly-sweet touch of scent which was only there at the periphery of perception. In moments, even that would be gone, and nothing would remain of those fools who sought to lay hands upon him this day.<br><br>He had come to the Karanas seeking other things, and would have let them be. Did they realize that he was merciful enough to allow them to lead their ant-like existences, beneath his notice? That they could --through simple inaction-- assure themselves of their own safety as well as that of their compatriots who followed suit?<br><br>The questions were academic now, but he doubted very much that they would not be applicable again, very soon. The fools seemed to have a death wish, and while he would not seek violence for the sake of violence, they would seek him, and he -would- defend himself. He -would- make examples of them.<br><br>His hawkish features were dispassionate, eyes of ice blue defocussed in thought as he turned away from the space which had so recently housed their remains. Gazing out over the vast, open expanse of the Karana plains, he began to murmur, under his breath, the precisely incanted formulae. Presently, a thin slit opened in the air before him, pulsing and modulating with energy cast in multihued array from realms which exist in places otherwhere, before rotating on an unseen axis to present a fully-formed portal.<br><br>The dreaded fool who carried the cloak for Altariell wasn't here, just as Istark had thought would be the case. But he would humor her, and seek the trinkets which she needed to bring the forces of nature more fully under her control. She had already lost the struggle against him; she now realized that worldly allegiances such as the ones she shared with those deluded fools of Jaggedpine were merely transitory. More and more, she was coming to see their hypocrisy.<br><br>Good. As Istark Kirtan stepped through the portal, he had already forgotten about the druids who had met their end mere minutes ago. The pieces of the grand chessboard were finally coming into defensible position, and soon, he would be able to concentrate on the plans which would lead --ultimately-- towards an endgame of sorts. <p><table width="350" border="0" bgcolor="#00662C"><tr bgcolor="#00A847"><td width="125"><div align="center"><img src="http://www.geraldfield.com/nadinesplace/muppetquiz/kermit.jpg" width="125" height="108"></div></td><td width="177" bgcolor="#00A847"><p align="center"><b><font size="3" color="#A4FFCB">You are Kermit!</font></b><font color="#A4FFCB"><br><font size="2">Though you're technically the star, you're pretty mellow and don't mind letting others share the spotlight.
