This is the sort of anonymous pro-wizard zealotry that really does nothing to advance the debate. This post in no way addresses ANY of Armok's point. The fact that you are &quot;totally happy with playing a wizard&quot; says nothing to Armok's data. <br>
<br>
Any time anyone critques wizards, we get these people who come out of the walls who have to put everyone in catagories. Because Armok offers a critique of the class he is &quot;crying about stuff we have recieved.&quot; That is extremism, and it is just as bad as people who accuse people who like playing wizards of thinking that nothing is wrong with the class.<br>
<br>
Most wizards don't hate themselves, and most wizards dont think the class is perfect either. This thread has been amazingly well thought out and some very nice comments have been placed. Let's not cheapen with extremist accusations and assertions that offer no data.<br>
<br>
Come on, the guy put in a lot of work. If you have a problem with what he wrote, at least put half as much work into your critque of him. <br>

<br>
To tell you the truth I didnt hit page 1,2,or even 3. I went right to page 4-6 at the time to see what people were saying.People were talking about,it seemed most posts were going towards the &quot;per Kunark&quot; time,of when wizards were totally screwed.With out after look of where we stand RIGHT now.<br>
 <br>
And seeing where we stand right now,Im not going to read 1 persons post on what they think. I went for the bread and butter and see what everyone else commented on.That way if I did decide to go and read the main list,I will see both sides and meny others towards this &quot;problem.<br>
<br>
As to anon posting. I post under my name. And Ill be more than happy to let you know what I have done. Been there,killed it first,done it again,let VI retune everything after we finnish.I know my game,and my game is good.I dont pretend to know everything,just a lot of what class I have played for over 2 years.But lets end the chest thumping.<br>
<br>
<br>
I post my feelings. I had a hard time comming to this webpage and posting. One was from when the epic was put in,and 99% of the wizards on this board wanted like clarity 2 effect,or some huge nuke that would be totally over blancing.Second was the non stop complaning of the wizard class. Of all the stuff people have posted on this message board,in retrospect how meny things would anyone take seriously.<br>
<br>
When I had seen this page was before I had joined my guild. I read all these posts and I ended up makeing a enchanter till lvl 40. Then kunark came out with lures,and other cool stuff,I decided to try him out again.I stoped comming here and I liked my wizard. There were a few things that could be better,but hey it all came to later down the stage.<br>
<br>
I love great ideas on how we can be better. Dont get me wrong. But the majory of people who post things to get better for our class,have not played a wizard in the upper 55's.The ones who &quot;claim  to get groups,or go on raids.&quot; Are we smart to sit there,and have these people who do nothing but solo at all times,voiceing their opinions and rants to VI?I know I dont. Thats the reason why I have come here.<br>
<br>
 I have ranted and all the fun stuff tooooo long on this post on this poor mans thread. Im hijacking it and Im sorry. Just people accuseing me of something I havent done makes me annoyed =). Just like when people didnt belive me when I said how much manaburn did. /shrug. Im here for facts and see if I can help explain stuff if anyone brings it up.Dont be scared to ask if you do.<br>

<br>
If you feel this way Raistin you should form a thread talking about it. Armok put an amazing amount of thought and work into this--he doesnt deserve to get a rant because you are pissed about wizzie bitching.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, you really really really should watch you generalizations. I am lvl 50, and have been very clear since day one that I have always been able to get a group. Of course unlike others, I never argued that that consequently meant the class was perfect. Nevertheless, I love my wizard and gave up a 45 shaman to play him full time. <br>
<br>
It has been said over and over again, people who think there is room for improvment in the class dont neccassarily hate the class. And people who love the class don't neccessarily think that its perfect.<br>
<br>
I am really sorry that you have had problems with people posting here. I have found Graffe's boards to be some of the most thought-provoking ones I have seen on EQ. But we don't have to agree on that. My only point is that venting that here, in this thread, is an awful idea.<br>
<br>
There is plenty of whining that goes on on this board. There is also blind optimism--people who think because something works for them it works for all wizzies. This thread is neither of those though. It didnt deserve that post, especially given that you hadn't even bothered to read the oriiginal post. <br>

Before I do that, let me say that there is one point, not so minor that I do agree with from the original post.  Mudflation, starting with Kunark and continuing to the present has definitely favored the melees.  Yes, casters have gotten some improvements, but NOTHING of the order of magnitude that the melees have received.  But to address that requires considerable adjustments to all casters, not just wizards.<br>
<br>
As to the complaint that wizards have trouble getting into exp groups, I wrote the following in response to a post whose point that was since our dps is below that of a warrior, wizards were (and apparently should be) denied entrance to a hypothetical group of 5 seeking a 6th.  Later discussions, aimed at minimizing the 'utility' of a wizard, postulated a group pulling singles in a place with no risk of adds in any form and the mobs being pulled posed no real danger to the group as a whole.<br>
<br>
To that discussion I added the following, which I feel has some relevance to Armok's original post:<br>
<br>
===========<br>
<br>
The original point of this thread was upping wizard damage per second in order to fill the 6th spot in a hypothetical single-pull, experience group.<br>
<br>
Baelzharon has pointed out that single-pull groups are a wizard's least effective exp gaining option.<br>
<br>
I want to make two points here. But both of them can be summed up as the fundamental premise(s) are wrong.<br>
<br>
First, the point is made that wizards sustained damage per second (dps hereafter), is too low. I do not contend what the actual figures are, to me they are irrelevant. I know my power and am quite satisfied with it, and for the most part have been throughout my wizardly career. I only made 60 less than 2 months ago, so I do remember the earlier part of my career quite well.<br>
<br>
But again, the dps is irrelevant. It is a convenient number to use because with logs hard numbers can be obtained and good comparisons made. Unfortunately, for the coveted 6th slot in the coveted group mentioned at the start, the real number of interest is not dps, it is blue bubbles of experience gained per hour, and possibly, amount of loot gained per hour. Dps is a tool to help measure that and a helpful one, but you should not lose sight of the real goal. It is efficient farming, whether that be of experience or loot or both. This point was brought home to me when the 'utility' that a wizard brings to a group was being cited as something that detracted from our dps. True, using root, snare, evacs, do reduce the dps of the wizard being micro-scrutinized. But those same spells increase the dps of the whole group. Most importantly, they increase the blue bubbles of exp gained per hour. And that is the thing that should be the focus here, not dps. Dps as the primary goal is really a red herring.<br>
<br>
Consider just snare. And let's assume for the moment that you do not have your epic, so you probably do not want to snare early and deliberately gain aggro at the start of the fight. Fine. Cast it later. It has an immediate effect, small, but noticeable. If your enchanter, cleric or other nuker somehow gets aggro, the pet is slower to get to them. This makes it easier for the tank to find it, follow and if not reacquire aggro, at least kill it quicker. But the real bonus is at the end of the fight. The mob goes into 'flee' mode. It can't go anywhere because its low HP have reduced its movement rate and the snare zeroes it out. Now all the melees get to hack at it, from whatever angle they want, and it does not hit back. It just stands there and dies. Not hitting the melees means less healer mana used, means more and faster pulls. Also means you can do tougher mobs since that last little bit of the mobs HP is 'free' to the group. Forget about not having to chase the mob, forget about trains, evacs and CRs. Just getting those free hits at the end adds more to the group efficiency than the wizard being able to squeeze off another nuke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Familiarity breeds contempt.&quot; It seems to me that is precisely the problem in this discussion. Some wizards are so used to snare, that they do not see its value. And snare is not the only utility wizards bring to a group. I have only three RL friends that still play EQ. 2 play mages. Two of the three play mages. I asked both how much dps they would be willing to give up to get snare. I asked them if they would give up 5% (remember snare is just one of our utilities), both not only said yes, they BOTH volunteered, independently that they would give up 15%, maybe more, just to have a snare. You may not value snare now, but I submit that if VI took it away from us, possibly as 'payment' for the requested increase in dps, your attitude would change dramatically. I know I would be mad.<br>
<br>
To even argue over the dps of a wizard is to concede the argument to those who say we don't do enough. You are letting someone else define the terms of the discussion. In so doing, you let them stack the deck in favor of the point they want to make. Just say 'no', admit that wizard sustained dps is less than class x and move on. The dps is not a reason to keep wizards out of that sought after single-pull group unless you let it be one.<br>
<br>
Now for the other point. This whole discussion has centered around attempts to get the 6th slot in a group that will always single pull mobs, with no risk of adds, trains, wipeouts, etc. Just steady exp killing with minimal risk. And the proposition was you were doing this not for social reasons, not for loot, but just to get exp. Why would any sane, competent wizard ever do this? Yeah, I have done it in the past, but still. Wizards are designed to be flashy. Hell, I equate 'nuke' with wizards. When I talk about design here, I am talking about the way we are now, with Lures, Familiars, maybe FT items and no manastones. I am not considering the so-called 'original' design from over 34 months ago.<br>
<br>
Wizards excel in risky, dangerous situations, and in AE. We not only have the most mana efficient nukes, we have the most time efficient nukes as well. And then there are the afore-mentioned utility spells, root, snare, stun, evac. Where we belong is in high-risk, high reward places. Doing the stuff that gets the adrenaline flowing. NOT just sitting there, waiting for mob 243 to be pulled, waiting some more for its HP to get low enough to nuke withut aggro, and then maybe one more nuke. Then medding again until mob 244 has been pulled and damaged enough. If that was what playing a wizard was all about, even 25% of the time for me, I would be playing some other class.<br>
<br>
Before you dismiss my point out of hand, sonsider this. What role does a rogue have in an AE group? A shaman? A Beastlord? Not a reasonable request to have a rogue in an AE group? From a rogue's point of view, why not? AE is hands down the best exp in the game. And yet these classes are not just lower dps than other possible classes, they really have NOTHING to contribute. Before you get bent out of shape over not making as large a contribution in a really very boring and, for a wizard, inappropriate sort of group, have pity on the rogue who will NEVER see the inside of an AE group.<br>
<br>
Its not that your answers are wrong. Its that you are answering the wrong questions.<br>

I think that you will agree that every caster has just as much utility, if not more, than the wizard.  Our snare is rather inefficient, costing 75 mana compared to a druid's snare of 5 mana.  Not saying that I would ever give it up, but just showing that we aren't the only class that can snare, by a long shot, since there are so many druids out there.  And you have to remember, tanks have arguably the best utility of all, the ability to take damage.  Comparing us to warriors, I would say that the ability for a warrior to take damage equals out, if not exceeds, all of our utility combined (in battle, I'm not including out of battle ports for the sake of arguement).  So if a warrior's &quot;utility&quot; is greater than a wizard's utility, we should do more damage than them. Maybe not as much as monks or rogues, but we should out damage warriors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulysandor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lysandor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.dmki.tv/omani.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/6/02 7:24:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=132>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> Maybe so...<br>

<br>
Yugy, just a quick couple of comments.  Yes, snare is a powerful ability.  However I'd say its usefulness in the single pull, easy exp encounter group is very diminished.  I've been in conventional (read: non-aoe) groups a couple times a week now since luclin, mostly in dungeons, and only casted snare a few times.  We simply didn't need it.  I'm not saying snare isn't great, just saying I for one rarely use it.  I don't even keep it memed as one of my &quot;default&quot; spells.  Best use for it is to stop SoWed mobs from running and quading IMO.  Even when I duo mobs in the grey or maidens or fungus grove I never snare, its just not needed.<br>
<br>
And to my dismay, I saw a ROGUE in an aoe group yesterday.  Not a crappy aoe group that couldn't kill very fast either (he was the puller).  Sacrilegious!<br>

Torrid, you are missing the point amd arguing against statements I never made. I am not even sure what you have a problem with. I never said we should only have one side of the argument. In fact if you read the thread from the start, I posted about the need for criticism of Armok's post. I also never said his post was &quot;offensive.&quot;  <br>
<br>
But his post isnt the other side, it is a rant against some of the things he doesnt like on this board. He admitted to not even READING Armok's post before hijacking it and going off. Sorry dude, I can't &quot;agree to disagree&quot; with someone attacking a post they didnt even bother to read.<br>
<br>
I can &quot;agree to disagree&quot; with Yugy's post. It doesnt side with Armok, but it goes beyond rhetoric and generalizations. There is a difference<br>

<br>
Now, Yugy, to address some of your points specifically:<br>
<br>
I do agree with the concept that every class should not be balanced equally for the same style of gameplay, even if it is considered by many players to be the best.  In the case of wizards, this means that their best fit is not in a single pull xp group, unless they are the only snarer.  However, I do object to suggesting that a wizard should spend his time mostly in AE groups.  From a purely selfish perspective, IE xp gained and fun had per hour for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  me</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, then sure AE groups or soloing is the way to go.  But AE groups, no matter how great they are, are still just a small subset of the grouping possibilities available in the game.  I think that just as every class shouldn't be balanced for the same kind of gameplay, nor should any class be overbalanced for another kind.<br>
<br>
One issue that was only briefly touched upon in this thread is the power of an Enchanter.  A good enchanter can turn most of the common pull situations into a series of single target encounters.  Single target nukes may save the enchanter the need to recast mez once or maybe even a few times every once in awhile, otherwise at high levels, selective nuking in experience groups isn't really as useful as it should be.  I've made up some spreadsheets myself that try to evaluate the amount of damage a smart nuker can save a group, but they are very complicated(4+ variables minimum).  But I have been very disappointed so far at my results, which show fairly trivial amounts of savings whenever there is an Enchanter present.<br>
<br>
From even a wizard who does not have trouble getting into groups, their long term damage is a concern.  My perspective is this:  Since we can show that there is indeed a descrepency here that could be adjusted without too much difficulty, what good reasons are there <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to make changes?  Saying things are fine the way they are, and even saying why they are fine the way they are isn't a bad thing, I often do it myself when trying to encourage others to have fun playing their characters rather than griping about things.  However, saying things are fine the way they are does not necessarily mean that changes would not be a good thing.  At this point, since Armok has shown, at least from a certian perspective, that helpful changes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  could</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  should</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be made, it is far more important now to focus on why such changes should not be made.<br>
<br>
I know I'm showing my moderate philosophy here, but there usually should be a compomise between extreme conservatism and activism.  Change should not be made simply for the sake of change or based on shallow opinions and unclear goals.  On the other hand, simply resisting change because it is a change is also not something I agree with very much.<br>
<br>
To me, the &quot;wizards are fine&quot; posts can be here all they want, but really provide nothing useful to this particular discussion, because they are merely conservative reactions to compelling arguments. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A> at: 1/6/02 9:54:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udunxed.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dunxed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/6/02 2:34:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=136>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:</span><hr size=1> I find it hard to believe that people are discussing snares in this post.<br>
<br>
The point to all of this I think is that Wizards have no DEFINING ability that is useful in group situations.<br>
<br>
Armok has summed up everything extremely well and I would hope when (if) something gets done that wizards are the ONLY ones to get it.  Selfish I know but we MUST have something that defined us apart from spells that are used in 0.5% of the game (e.g. Dragonsbane/Giantsbane spells)<br>
<br>
Mages have pets, Necro's have pets and dots, Wizards have TL's -&gt; whooppe dee doo.<br>
<br>
We are a great class and I'm a FIRM beilever that we should be what we were originally intended to be -&gt;&gt; MASTERS OF DAMAGE.<br>
<br>
With the changes Armok has listed we would become this class.  <br>

<br>
We dont get a pet, thats a big sacrafice, pets are incredibly powerful, especially mage/necro pets.<br>
<br>
We dont get any significant buffs or debuffs. No heal, no DOT, etc. <br>
<br>
There are a lot of things in terms of playability that wizards were denied as a class BECAUSE of the theory/mentality that they were a straight-foward damage nuker. A sort of one-dimensional theory, etc.<br>
<br>
The problem is, we got all those &quot;one-dimensional&quot; drawbacks and not enough nuke. You shouldnt have to wait til 51, and then 60, to really FEEL like a wizard.<br>
<br>
When level 60 make comments about the 1-60 nature of the class, I really wish they would remember back to their early days,and consider just how bad wizards suck compared to other casters.<br>
<br>
IMO, wizards would be fixed If<br>
a) Mana cost per spell was reduced, or damage per spell was increased<br>
b) Rains did 3x wave to 4 mobs, Not just 4 ways total. If wizard rains were doing major major damage, then the problems wizards face getting in groups would be over.<br>
<br>
<br>
This game takes an enormous amount of real life play time to advance, it is entirely about sustained damage. Wizards are the worst caster for exp groups because everyone knows that the standary exp group will get more exp with almost any other type of caster before a wizard.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think our class has come a LONG way since pre-kunark, but the journey isnt over. We need something to increase our sustained damage output, and im not talking about things that you have to be in a level 60 uber guild and give up a real life to get.<br>

First off let me commend Armok, I've always been impressed with his work. He's done more calculations than I would ever want to in the remaining span of my life.<br>
<br>
The information was objectevely stated in almost an Essay quality, stating this is what is going on. these are the numbers, this is the data, do what you like this is what you'll see. and what you'll see is that wizards are not on a level playing field with other classes.<br>
<br>
Now let me state exactly what puts this apart from MOST of the other attempts to show our class flaws...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> This Document does not show &quot;what is wrong with the wizard class&quot;. This Document shows numbers that don't add up when they should be added up.  Previous attempts that say Verant said this, where's the follow-through; We're unbalanced and need a fix, etc...  they are still fundamentally Wizards vs. Verant.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Any attempts to convince someone to do something that seems like personal benifit will be viewed as such.  Even if it benifits the many, human nature will cause developers at Verant to go on the defensive and want to say, &quot;No.. we know better, you can't tell us what to do&quot;<br>
<br>
The numbers show numbers. Numbers and mathematics are not opinions, aren't ideals.  Numbers are our tools, formulae our devices.  <br>
<br>
This shows basically: I've taken the initiative and done your research for you, and what the numbers show is this.  As you can see these numbers need to be brought down, and these numbers need to be raised in order to tweak this class to match where it should be on the DPS front.<br>
<br>

<br>
I really wish verant wasn't so chicken @#%$ to put good caster items in this game...that's what it really comes down to...lets face it, verant is really centered on the group necessity, and casters by nature are extremely good soloers.  They are constanly juggling between these two games and there lies the problem.<br>
<br>
If we were to get 33% more efficient DD or whatever, while it wouldn't enhance our quad kite skills, we could more than likely do singles in the same timeframe.  So now, we can solo 3 or 4 blue con mobs using DD...pick the right mob, it can happen....add in a 15sec robe that would supposedly drop KC as proposed, well...ummm you get my point.<br>
<br>
the only way around this is to add stupid code that would make our nukes more efficient while grouped, and scale depending on how many members...but where is the roleplay or logic in that? It feels too 'staged' if that's the right word.<br>
<br>
Also, where did this new server stuff come from? That unbalancing problem is easily avoided by a server split, as mine (Xev) has come out of a split with Povar and Tarew-marr.  We have lots of manastones and prenurf crap and whatnot. <p><html>

<br>
First. my   hat off to the original poster fabulous work, well written, and appears to be well  researched.<br>
<br>
Second, my wizard plays only with the same 5 ppl every week (once a week we play that group) Originally in that group I played a necro up to level 17.  The mobs were dead before I could get the 2nd dot cast.  We decided a necro was ineffecient. (you think wizards have a hard time grouping, try a necro). To shorten the next 20 levels of tuning the group we now have ogre sham, troll warr,  ogre war, DE wiz, DE chanter, DE cleric and are approaching lvl  37. (odd...all of us have primary characters from light races...) This once a week group doesnt really have delusions of lvl 60.  (four of the 6 have primaries over 50) I STRONGLY feel that I should be able to contribute to my groups success  right NOW.<br>
<br>
I think the group would be much better served for me to start over as some other class, perhaps a mage since we want to stay all evil, although perhaps an SK would be good.  Right now I contribute snare and about 640dmg to a fight.  I dare  say even the shaman contributes more than that.  Chanter and cleric obviously  contribute  little to none in the way of damage, but are none the less essential.  I really cant imagine playing a wizard with out clarity all the time.  I remember before our chanter could cast it, I was ALWAYS OOM (which was ok, cuz i couldnt evac yet anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). <br>
<br>
I think what a lot of people are trying to point out is that wizards need to be viable in a group  situation at all levels, but ESPECIALLY the lower levels, because BGH's aren't a valid option nor are the killer AE exp groups. (My primary is a bard... I understand and benefit from the contribution of a wizard in an AE exp group post 50!)<br>
<br>
I will not invite a wizard into an xp group without an enchanter or bard.  When I am playing my cleric (40) and I do not have my pet enchanter available, that wiz  can go quad. sorry, but wizards make for slower kills, with the low damage and lack of agro management.  (agro  management is a whole 'nother thread...) My bard will always invite a wizard, (mana is not in such short supply then)<br>
<br>
It is the casual player that is hurt by the lack of  group viability in the lower levels.  Usually the casual player is playing for social reasons.  He or she obviously doesnt mind fast xp, but that is not the primary  purpose of play.  As a result, casual  players (at least me) want to group and we want to be effective members of the group.  <br>
<br>
I hope this doesnt sound like too much disjointed ramblings. Basically I want the original  document submitted because I agree 100 percent.<br>
