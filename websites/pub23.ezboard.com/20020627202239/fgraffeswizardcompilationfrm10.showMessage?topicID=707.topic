Use their offensive abilities or use thier defensive abilities, they can not do both as well as they can do one or the other.  Consider the amount of damage a wizard sacrifices when he must snare the mob.  A cleric utilizing his defensive abilities sacrifices damage in the same way.  Clerics are given the responsibility of a choice to either heal or deal damage.  As a penalty for their offensive/defensive versatility, their nukes are slower, less effecient, and all magic based.<br><br>Consider a situation where all group damage taken is completely healed by regeneration.  The cleric defensive spells are 100% useless.

Never.<br><br>You can have &quot;enough&quot; defense, to the point that more defensive ability is totally wasted.<br><br>You can have &quot;enough&quot; situational utility, to the point where a group needs no other special abilities to accomplish whatever they want.<br><br>You can never have &quot;enough&quot; offense.  Adding offense will almost <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>always</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> result in a more powerful group.  The only situations where more offense is not beneficial is when you have enough firepower to insta-kill a mob.<br><br>Looked at in this fashion, it seems unfair for any class to be incapable of dealing an adequete amount of damage, should the situation demand.  It's for this reason that I have such a problem with that 1.3x level or 6 levels hard cap on resists.  It's for this reason that lures are in the game.  It's for this reason that magicians have such a problem with Kunark(bad pet zones, uber mob resistances = worthless)<br><br>The way things are now, wizards are better enough at nuking than clerics such that a group will never add a cleric over a wizard if what they really want is nuking ability. <p><center><img src = "http://doug.feldmann.com/Golsig2.jpg"><br><font = "arial">Conjurer | <a href = "http://www.darkblood.com">Darkblood</a> |<a href = "http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8506">Profile</a> </font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urombusmindspire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Moderator</font></td></tr></table><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Verant's #1 Fanboy</font></td></tr></table><br><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif><a href=mailto:rombus@graffe.com style=text-decoration: none><font color=#FFFFFF>Contact Rombus</font></a></font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/11/02 8:47:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=707.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/sidepic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Nuking....what really should have happend</span><hr size=1> Shaman nukes suck, their DoTs rock.<br><br>Cleric nukes are for the most part pointless.

This is just your opinion, yet you are stating it as if it is an absolute truth.  Quite obviously, Verant has decided that it's ok for clerics to act like wizards if they want to.. here's the catch though-  try as they might, Clerics will never nuke as well as wizards.  When the battle is over and you're tallying the results, a wizard doing his job will almost always come out ahead of a cleric trying to be a wizard.  Chances are that the difference will be an amount that is generally considered &quot;significant.&quot;  <br><br>I know that I, as a magician, generally nuke better than a cleric.  I also know that a wizard nukes significantly better than I.  Generally..  half of my damage is pet, the other half is nukes.

I would call that &quot;significant.&quot;  If wizards have significantly better nukes than magicians and if magicians have marginally better nukes than clerics, then my guess is that wizard nukes are also significantly better than cleric nukes. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A> at: 4/26/02 10:31:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/27/02 8:19:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=707.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *shaking head*</span><hr size=1> &quot;I know that I, as a magician, generally nuke better than a cleric.

You are saying in so many words &quot;wizards nuke twice as hard as I do&quot; and that's total horsecrap.  What exactly are you trying to prove by defending Clerics nuking nearly as hard as Wizards AND being premeire healers AND wearing plate AND buffing AND using superior weapons AND having superior combat skills AND having better hps.

Mages never cease to stun me with the bizarre apparent belief that Wizards are some kind of utility Gods and nuke on the side.<br><br>Are you arguing for the sake of argument?  I know you aren't deluded enough to think that Clerics and Wizards are balanced only if Clerics can nuke almost as well or better than Wizards.  Take away EVERY SINGLE nuke that Clerics have and thier power, utility, use to a group, and even soloing ability is almost totally unchanged.  <br><br>The fact is, they shouldn't have ever been given nukes in the first place - if nukes hadn't been seeded so liberally and so similar in power among so many classes Wizards wouldn't be in the state they are now in Everquest.  Verant fears making Wizard nukes more powerful - maybe rightfully so.  But the reason Wizards probably SHOULD have more potent nukes is because when you compare to all the other classes, the distinction just is not very significant.  You can throw generalities and &quot;I think&quot; statements all you want but when the actual numbers hit the paper, it says a totally different story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufynalwiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fynalwiz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/28/02 5:57:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=707.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *shaking head*</span><hr size=1> &quot;Take away EVERY SINGLE nuke that Clerics have and thier power, utility, use to a group, and even soloing ability is almost totally unchanged.&quot;<br><br>This is really the essential point.

That's true in a way.  Look at wizards, except for your token defensive skills and stuns, the class is built around nukes.  Usually, when wizards aren't nuking, they're doing something that will help them nuke better.  (Such as harvesting, using concussion, or calling a familiar for mana regen).

Instead of doing what you guys seem to do, which is to start with wizards as nukers and clerics as healers, I start by making everyone equal and working out from there.<br><br>Imagine two classes, each one with identical spells.  They can both heal and they can both nuke equally well.  These classes are balanced with each other correct?  How can they not be?  They are identical!  So then I start making small adjustments to move them away from equality while attempting to maintain balance.  I'm tired and don't want to go into the details now, but I was thinking this way when I was trying to answer, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> for myself</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the question &quot;why do clerics nuke as well as they do?&quot;<br><br>Instead of assuming that I was right, and that clerics should not be able to nuke, I instead tried to find the answer to the question.

It was this train of thought that led to the arguments you see in this thread.

No.  I'm arguing because it seems to me that you guys have a slightly selfish point of view on game balance.

In case you've never hunted there, some of the mobs have signficant AE attacks which, depending on the levels and resists of your raid, can require rather large amounts of healing.  On the non-ae mobs, one good tank and one good cleric is generally plenty of defense, with some healers watching the tashers and slowers.  The clerics are often left with no one to heal, so they end up nuking.  However, the cleric healing is still needed for the AE mobs and for emergencies.  Much of the time though, a cleric has nothing but nukes to spend mana on.<br><br>Same thing in a group..   If you get a tank with suffecient level and AC, sometimes a good array of regeneration sources can keep up with mob damage output.  In these situations, healing is unneeded.  What is a cleric supposed to do, use fear?  Stuns?  Well if the damage being taken is already insignificant stuns arent going to change much except in the case of gaters.<br><br>Solo?
