<br>
I have a project for school where I have to make up a questionairre and gather responses from people from a range of ages/cultures. I'd rather not stand in the street handing them out, so I figured I'd appeal for help on a couple message boards. I'd really, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> appreciate it if you took a couple minutes to answer these questions... just ten of them (the first two don't count -- they're for statistical purposes only). If you don't want anyone to know your age, just make up an anonymous account and post there, should you be that inclined to help me out.<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Please note -- the following questions involve issues that some people may have issues with and may provoke some sensitive arguments; I would ask that you please keep arguments to a minimum so this does not turn into a moral mudslinging; also, if you are the sensitive type, you may not want to state your opinion for some of the questions... if this is the case, I ask that you not answer it at all -- only fully completed questionnaires are of any use to me</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  This questionnaire has been designed to see how values and morals differentiate across different age and gender groups.

<br>
<br>
1. How old are you?<br>
<br>
2. Are you Male or Female?<br>
<br>
3. Is it acceptable to discipline a child physically (spanking -- <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  not abusively</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->) when the child has done something wrong?<br>
<br>
4. Do you believe divorce is morally wrong?<br>
<br>
5. Would you ever enter into a serious relationship with the mentality &quot;if it doesn't work out, I can just get divorced&quot; ?<br>
<br>
6. Do you believe abortion is morally wrong? (consider this -- if you found out beforehand that your child would be disabled in some way {mentally, physically, or otherwise}, would you abort the birth?)<br>
(remember to answer the original question, not the situation used as an example)<br>
<br>
7. Should abortion be used as a form of contraception?<br>
<br>
8. Do you believe genetic manipulation of an unborn child (ie: determining the child's physical attributes, gender, etc, before birth) is morally wrong?<br>
<br>
9. Should homosexual couples be allowed to be legally married? (consider this: two people of the same gender are very much in love, and would like to get married, but cannot, because the law in their area forbids it; another couple, this one heterosexual, gets married; the relationship doesn't work out and they don't love each other, but they are entitled to more rights under the law as a married couple than the homosexual couple; is this fair?)<br>
(remember to answer the original question, not the example)<br>

11. Should pornography (in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> any</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> form -- literature, visual, etc) be accepted as an art form?<br>

The only way I would even consider abortion would be if the child was going to live a life of severe pain and misery, and bringing him or her into the world would be detrimental to them. And then I'd still have to consider it.<br>

Male<br>
3. Is it acceptable to discipline a child physically (spanking -- not abusively) when the child has done something wrong?<br>
yes<br>
4. Do you believe divorce is morally wrong?<br>
Yes, unless that person is in a relationship where she/he is being phyically or emotionally abused or the spouse has drastically changed in views<br>
5. Would you ever enter into a serious relationship with the mentality &quot;if it doesn't work out, I can just get divorced&quot; ?<br>
I don't believe I would<br>
6. Do you believe abortion is morally wrong? (consider this -- if you found out beforehand that your child would be disabled in some way {mentally, physically, or otherwise}, would you abort the birth?)<br>
(remember to answer the original question, not the situation used as an example)<br>
I believe in natural selection and that it (should take care of itself).  UNFORTUNATELy this isn't true anymore due to our ability to extend the lives of those who would not make it in the environment in which this theory was evolved from.  So I do believe I would abort the birth if the following occasion were true because they would have little to add to the world.  But I speak from the view point of a person who is not mentally deficient.  If the person were just physically crippled I would let that person live and be birthed.  Without a mind few things can be rendered hopeful though.<br>
7. Should abortion be used as a form of contraception?<br>
I do not believe that it should be so.<br>
8. Do you believe genetic manipulation of an unborn child (ie: determining the child's physical attributes, gender, etc, before birth) is morally wrong?<br>
I do not believe it is morally wrong.  Genetics if used properly would and should only create traits or refine traits that would take out defects that occur in patters throughout the past generations.<br>
9. Should homosexual couples be allowed to be legally married? (consider this: two people of the same gender are very much in love, and would like to get married, but cannot, because the law in their area forbids it; another couple, this one heterosexual, gets married; the relationship doesn't work out and they don't love each other, but they are entitled to more rights under the law as a married couple than the homosexual couple; is this fair?)<br>
(remember to answer the original question, not the example)<br>
This is not fair to the homosexual couple in the laws provided that doctrine our country and lead the ways of the United States.  Homosexuality is wrong but that is not what you asked.<br>
10. Are inter-racial marriages acceptable (eg: should an African man be allowed to marry an Asian woman?)?<br>
I do believe so because we were all at one time the same race until by folly of another person who the current generation had no control over failed and was stricken.<br>
11. Should pornography (in any form -- literature, visual, etc) be accepted as an art form?<br>
It depends upon the type of pornography.  Some pornography that is an expression of the capabilities, the freedoms, or the ways that life can be expresed are not wrong.  It is not wrong, I believe to show someone who is naked in a doctrine about their situation in which they were naked.  It is not an art where only sexual frenzies occur.  That is where art seperates and hormonal spikes takeover.  <br>
12. Would you sooner take a job that pays a lot but your work will result in little, or a job where your work has an impact but you aren't paid much? (ie: do you want money or satisfaction out of your job?)<br>
I would rather do what I would enjoy doing if that would provide me with enough money to retain the necessities of life such as Everquest, water, shelter, some type of food, and work.   <p><table width="50%" align="center">

3. Yes. You can't tell me that &quot;time out&quot; or &quot;sitting in the corner&quot; actually disciplines a child. I have 2 cousins who were &quot;disciplined&quot; in this manner, while I was spanked now and then, and believe you me my parents made me better off for it.<br>
<br>
4. No, not if there is a good reason. Divorcing somebody &quot;just 'cuz&quot; is wrong, but if there is a good reason I don't think it would be morally wrong.<br>
<br>
5. No.<br>
<br>
6. Yes, abortion should be outlawed, in almost any form. I would not even think about abortion, even if my child would be born with AIDS and live a maximum of 8 years, I would not abort him/her.<br>
<br>
7. No.<br>
<br>
8. Yes, they were made a certain way for a purpose. The only genetic manipultion I would approve of would be to get rid of a fatal disease, not to genetically enhance someone.<br>
<br>
9. No, people were made a certain way for a reason. Men and women were meant to be together, that's obvious through our physical makeup.<br>
<br>
10. Yes, we're all humans.<br>
<br>
11. It depends on the nature of the pornography. Showing Adam and Eve nude is ok, showing people having orgies is not an art form.<br>

12.

(remember to answer the original question, not the situation used as an example)<br>
yes<br>
<br>
7. Should abortion be used as a form of contraception?<br>
no, if you are going to have sex, you have to be ready for everything that goes with it.<br>
<br>

yes<br>
<br>
9. Should homosexual couples be allowed to be legally married? (consider this: two people of the same gender are very much in love, and would like to get married, but cannot, because the law in their area forbids it; another couple, this one heterosexual, gets married; the relationship doesn't work out and they don't love each other, but they are entitled to more rights under the law as a married couple than the homosexual couple; is this fair?)<br>

The pornography question seems to be causing a bit of confusion, so I'll try clarifying it by explaining why it's there:<br>
<br>
Recently (within the last month), a man somewhere in Ontario, Canada, underwent trial for possession of child pornography. He had no videos or pictures or anything -- what he had was a bunch of stories he had written himself and saved on his computer. He claimed they were not illegal as they were not distributed publicly, they were the works of his own mind, and they were for his own use. He claimed the stories were not pornography; rather, they were art. He was proclaimed &quot;not guilty&quot; given this evidence. This caused a huge uproar, and understandably so. People now want the law to draw a clear line that distinguishes between art and pornography. For several years, certain groups have been trying to shut down the pornography industry, but have been unable to because the industry claims that infringes upon freedom of expression, and pornography of any kind is expression of emotion through art and acting. This could be true to videos, books, pictures, stories, anything. <br>
<br>
I agree with what you are all saying, that nudity can be portrayed tastefully. When answering that question, bear this in mind: in some cities in Ontario, it is legal for women to walk around on the street topless; in many cities in Quebec, Ontario's neighbouring province (and some Ontario cities), it is legal to portray nudity on television during prime-time (not just late-night hours) so long as it is not portrayed in an erotic or sexually sugesstive manner (this became true after TBS accidentially showed an un-edited version of Demi Moore's <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Striptease</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> at about 6:00 p.m. in Hull, Quebec, about 2 years ago -- the judge ruled that it was alright since it was just a topless woman dancing, and had no sexuality involved). <br>
<br>
Keeping that in mind, feel free to revisit the question! Thanks again for all your help!! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uleopapanthera.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leopa Panthera</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/16/02 10:47:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=307.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: thanks!!</span><hr size=1> 1. 25<br>
