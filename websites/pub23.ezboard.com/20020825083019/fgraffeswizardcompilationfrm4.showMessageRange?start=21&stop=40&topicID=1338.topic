Stupid group, eh?  Seems to me the best use for the HP transfer spells in groups is to heal the main healer so they can keep the tank up.  In my experience clerics often put themselves last in the healing rotation and then to die to low hp aggro.  Obviously if your hps are already low you wouldn't transfer, but if you are grouped with people who don't recognize the value in your abilities, it doesn't mean those abilities are valueless, it means those people are dumbasses.<br>

Oh man i know how that feels, my alt is a 49 chanter.  Mez resists are supposedly aided by a high CHA score, and resists go down as you get higher level.  When you get into the 50's i think you'll find it is pretty reliable.  But if people are breaking mez, again, that is a bad group, not a useless ability.  I do think this ability for necs should be improved, lowered recast delay or something.<br>

This is the part i really don't understand.  Yeh the conversion rate is for shit, in a raid situation it is probably better to transfer HPs to the cleric for modrodding than to directly transfer mana.  But you have the ability to do it.  Let's see, hypothetical situation: raiding, clerics are LOM, tanks are going to die soon, necros have already sunk their dots and have regened a decent amount of mana with lich.  Your mana is at this point not doing much.  Why not twitch the cleric?  I'd really like to understand why necs are so vehementally opposed to this idea.  If your mana transfer saves the raid from wipeout, wasn't it worth it?  I mean, i absolutely despise doing pickups and TLing people out at the end.  It's demeaning, makes me feel like a glorified taxi, but i do it in the interests of teamwork.  Why do you refuse to twitch even when the situation warrants it?<br>

Yeh i won't argue that soloing is boring, i argue that you back yourself into a corner by making all these reasons why soloing is all you can do, and constantly talking about how VI is trying to keep you down, even though you have actually received some boosting lately.  I know several necros who are outstanding groupers.  They work behind the scenes, a little damage here, some hit points there, little twitching when THEY think it is appropriate (i would never demand a necro twitch since i know ya'll are so touchy about it) mezzing when neccessary, and they are valuable contributing members of the group.  I mean hey, if you are happy farming, them more power to you, be happy.  But you don't sound happy, you sound angry, and i just want you to know that there is another path you could walk. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umagisterdarkshadowquester.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Magisterdark Shadowquester</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://barbenspics.homestead.com/files/quacktag.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/31/02 10:16:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1338.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://barbenspics.homestead.com/files/quacktag.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Again No Rant</span><hr size=1> You've just asked of the most Shamefull Period of Necromancer History in all of EQ.<br>
<br>
I can give you a True &amp; Full answer. I lived through it.<br>
____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Pre-Kunark my Class were the Greatest Killers in all of EQ. We call this period &quot;The Flower of the Necromancer&quot;.<br>
<br>
Verant broke us and put us under the Yoke. They made Slaves of us. How you ask? They Raised the MR on Uber &amp; Boss Mobs and kept our Life Taps from hitting. This in effect locked us out of High Level Encounters. We could not even Quest our own EPIC (at the time our EPIC required that we KILL our OWN GOD). Our Life Taps resisted. Our DOTs would not stick. We had NOTHING to offer anyone in the End Game that another Class could not do better.<br>
<br>
The Slave Listens When The Master Speaks: <br>
<br>
Verant threw us the Subversion Spell Line. Calls by the HUNDREDS of &quot;Twitch Me BITCH!&quot; &amp; &quot;Got my own Pet Necro!&quot; were showered on us like a Black Rain of Filth. We were being OWNED. We were Slaves. We were doing ANYTHING to get into the End Game.<br>
<br>
My Class makes up less than 5% of the Playerbase now. Elder Necromancers quit EQ by the Thousands. The Flame Wars on the Necro Board...you will have to look. There simply is no other way.<br>
<br>
Elders of the Old School (of which I am one &amp; will die standing with the Point of Blue) Will NEVER bend the knee to Verant. We are very few now (my Class) and hard shelled Bastards indeed.<br>
<br>
There have been more than a few of us who have wished &amp; planed Physical Harm on ANY Verant Employee we could get our hands on. It's only a GAME you will say. Sorry, but as of March it's a GAME people kill themselves over. We were VERY close to that.<br>
<br>
A Necromancer TWITCHBITCH is a Willing Slave who dishonours us all. You kill then out of hand as you would a Rabid Dog &amp; with as little thought.<br>
<br>
I out lived the &quot;VISION TEAM(tm)&quot; by keeping my head down for 2 years. I'm not the onlyone.<br>
<br>
Verant can never afford to let us up again. We would eat the rest of the Classes alive. We did it before.<br>

<br>
Yeah, Verant overcompensated when balancing necromancers before, but is that really justification for hurting someone?  As for needing help on your epic, everyone does, and there is no way a cleric is about to melee Ixblat Fer, let alone Ragefire!  Necromancers are hardly alone in that regard.  Try to focus on that.<br>
<br>
And find yourself a good counselor.<br>

<br>
BET that a HARDCORE SW Fan (you know the type. The type who's FONDEST WISH is to get Carry Fisher back into a Brass Bra) won't burn down Verant if Verant treats SW:G as it has EQ?<br>

These people are both on the EDGE &amp; Verant just about pushed the Necromancers over it. THANK GOD it never happened.<br>

<br>
Its only a game.  Sheesh, my main is a cleric, the most in demand class for helping OTHER people there is!  Clerics can do nothing well, except heal others.  Crappy nukes, iffy roots, no travel utility spells, etc.  On top of it we get raid guilt/burnout, or are made to feel lousy because we have to log off and people who can't think outside the box conclude the group is doomed.  In the post-50 world, especially in the post-55 world we find it increasingly harder to find groups because healing at our level just isn't needed, and a shaman or druid has enough and brings additional utility to the table.<br>
<br>
Sounds like something to rant about?  Maybe.  But Verant could give cheal and rez to druids and I would just start playing a differant character, or maybe take up a differant game.<br>
<br>
I most certainly wouldn't talk about wanting to hurt people, and regardless of the motivation there is no way a game could ever be construed as a reasonable platform from which to justify such an action.<br>

&amp; No, I DON'T condone killing. I was in the Service Back When &amp; In Country. Seen it first hand &amp; find it very distastful to say the least. If you mean Training or causing the Deaths of a Twitch Bitch Party  *****ONLINE***** you are most correct. DONE IT &amp; WILL AGAIN.<br>

You asked the Question. You have problems with the answer...it's your problem.<br>
<br>
Necromacers are NOT NICE PEOPLE. We NEVER have been. It takes a certain Mind Set to be a Necromancer for any lenght of time. ALL a good Necromancer thinks of when he/she hears &quot;Bunny&quot; is Lunch.<br>
<br>
THIS IS HOW IT WAS, NOT ****HEAR SAY****. I WAS THERE.<br>
<br>
It doesn't show on your Board but my EQ Account is dated February 10, 1999. I've lived through the entire Bloody thing.<br>
<br>
Chew on that a bit &amp; I'll see you on the Necro Board, <p>37 Teir'Dal Necromancer, Solusek Ro.

<br>
Please ignore Mags.  I'm not sure why he does the /eqsoapopera mode *on* but whatever.  He has been level 37 permanewbie foreverandever.<br>
<br>
The original post lamented about the soloing ability at level 16ish I think.  The teens are a rough level for everyone, necros included.  And yes, lowbie groups can suck as usually they're full of loot mongers and clueless casters who prefer to tank instead of med.<br>
<br>
The best advice I can give you is to stay in the old world for a while.  Mobs are easier, and loot is not bad.  Look at the hunting guides on various sites.  The magician's tower and shaman website have some good ones sorted by level range.  Check 'em out.<br>
<br>
Wizards are a great class.  Hang in there, and you'll be landing god killer damage on mobs down the road.  If you want to give necromancers a whirl, you might like it as well.  The downside is if you like grouping, post 50 /crickets chirp when you LFG.  The upside is, you don't need a group even at 60.<br>
<br>
Good luck in your endeavors.<br>

To answer your question about twitching, I personally dont like it, but i do it when its clearly beneficial.  I try to avoid doing it during a fight when there is something else i can be doing, but during the buffing stage, my mana is hardly doing me any good when im sitting there FM, and we're waiting for the oom cleric to get another 2k mana for BoA.  In that situation I think your just being an idiot if you refuse to twitch.<br>
<br>

With my cleric I will rarely, and only in the most dire of situations, ask a necromancer for their mana.  I consider myself very fortunate that the 3 50+ necromancers we have in guild (one level 60) are true professionals and have twitched me in rough pulls when I announce &quot;30m.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I was in an xp group in the grey where the necromancer and I spent the entire session feeding each other.  I fed him hps with mana efficient heals (he was fully hp buffed including symbol so he could lich like a...err...fiend) and he in turn twitched me to help keep my mana up for everyone else.  Worked beautifully until it was time for us to wrap up and leave.  Necromancers that have adapted and learned how to function in groups are a true joy for me as a cleric.<br>
<br>
As an update on my wizard though (since this was the point) he is currently xp'ing in Highpass Hold and has just made level 17.  Dealt with some real winners, but I've found calmly communicating with them (ex &quot;please let others loot too&quot; and &quot;it looks bad when you loot the majority of the kills&quot; sent in /tells)  has helped tremendously.  Of course my new rant is research, and finding the *&amp;#@%&amp;* runes...LOL Oh well, I never expected life to be easy as a wizard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umortyundercrypt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morty Undercrypt</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.necrognomicon.com/images/mbicon1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/1/02 8:59:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1338.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.necrognomicon.com/images/mortyhead3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Well...</span><hr size=1> I feel your mana-regeneration pain in those first couple dozen levels, and it's also nice that you haven't turned into a buff beggar.

Seriously though, while necromancers have certainly had some rocky times over the past few years, not all of us have become sociopathic freaks or bitter bile-spewing misfits.  Just felt that needed to be said.<br>

<br>
First thou - Zarros<br>
<br>
I remember how tough it was leveling my wizard at those levels.  Root/DD is pretty dangerous and time consuming.  I found thou that getting a SoW and Clarity (have to remember this was back before CII and KEI) made me into a solo master.  With SoW I could easily kite/DD mobs all day long with very little fear and Clarity cut my downtime a ton.<br>
<br>
Once you get Bonds of Force it gets alot easier and I still am amazed when I play my Wizard and do a quad kite.  Nothing like plowing thru 4 blues at one time~<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
To an extent that is true but only to those that really do not look deeper into our ability.  Sure Screaming Terror was meant to be a tool to split spawns or handle double pulls but nothing stops us from using it as a CC tool in a group.  Root was intended as an means of allowing us to escape but again nothing stops us from using it to do CC.<br>
<br>
Alot of our abilities may have been intended for use while soloing but most can also be used for grouping, it just takes a bit of adjustment.  I leveled to 60th lvl and spent 90% of my time grouped with friends.  Perhaps that gives me a different prospective upon our grouping abilities then you.<br>
<br>
Now I am not going to say we are among the best group classes in EQ either.<br>

<br>
It has been proven before that the '4 pet limit' has either been removed or modified to an extent that it no longer applies.  We slew some boss in VT (can not remember his screwed up name off hand but was the one at the top of the stairs near the sword room) and during that fight we had more then 4 pets engaged up.  Mages have done alot of testing about this issue, check out their site if you need more information.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
But you have the ability to do it. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Having the ability does not equate to it being usefull to use.  For example:  Rangers and BL's both have Greater Heal, are you going to tell them to not melee but to instead Heal/medidate the main tank?  Of course not because their ability to heal is so minor that taking them away from their damage dealing role would be a waste.<br>
<br>
The same is true for single target mana transfers after a certain point.  Plus with the advent of the T-Rod the xxx Subversion line becomes unneeded and a rather expensive waste of mana.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Let's see, hypothetical situation: raiding, clerics are LOM, tanks are going to die soon, necros have already sunk their dots and have regened a decent amount of mana with lich. Your mana is at this point not doing much. Why not twitch the cleric?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Because there is nearly never a time when the Necromancer should not be using his own mana.  With the current limitations upon DoTs we are often forced into using our Life Taps or our lowly DD spells to supplment our damage.  <br>
<br>
By me feeding burning up 1,200 mana to give enough for a Cleric to cast a single Complete Heal I will now have cut my own ability to cause damage.  Again would you ask the Ranger over in the corner with Trueshot to heal instead of causing damage? <br>

<br>
There is a HUGE difference between that and mana feeding.  What would you say if in the middle of the fight you where asked to go do some ports?  Asking a Necromancer to feed mana is taking away from their combat performance, trans'ing after a raid does not.<br>
