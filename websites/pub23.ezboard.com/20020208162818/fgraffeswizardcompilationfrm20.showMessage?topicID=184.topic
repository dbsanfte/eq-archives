I did this because I'm 47th level and the bloodgills are not coming out in pairs when I flux one anymore.  I don't like to die, and killing them was getting to be more dangerous than I liked.<br><br>So, I headed that way.  I got a tell from my brother who really wanted to come mooch and save me from those nasty OOM situations.<br><br>Little did we know just how much fun we were in for.<br><br>Let me start by saying that I eventually had to kite these guys underwater.  No matter where I tried to kite them on land, some one would always wander up and try to watch the fireworks.  Well, since I was WAY faster than the specs, and CoF refresh takes a few seconds, I was sometimes out of range of the specs.  My brother is a shadow knight, and in the past, he always manages to almost get killed because he tries to dot a mob or smack them as they run by.  I always tell him to just sit down and take the xp, but he never seems to remember the last time we did the exact same thing and he died horribly.  So, like usual, he goes right into the fray and smacks a spec to &quot;help out&quot;  Of course, all 4 aggro him, and I have to run up and flux/nuke/jiggle-my-booty to get them back on me.  I left one on him just to teach him a lesson, and he proceeded to start loading up dots and fear.<br><br>This was the messed up part.  I have heard of specs doing this before, but I had never seen it.  Even though my brother had like 1 red bub of health and 3 dot/debuffs on the spec, it just couldn't resist lifetapping, then slashing to death every single person that wandered by.  The thing never even missed a step.  Newbies  were dropping like flies as the spectre would just mow them down.  Needless to say, that was the last time that I did specs on dry land. <br><br>Anyway, the moral of the story is:<br><br>Specs are mean.  They like to kill newbies.  I recommend quadding specs underwater.<br><br><br>EDIT:  I removed the flamebait material.  Summar made me feel like crap.<br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urashakra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rashakra</A> at: 10/17/01 10:52:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usummar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Summar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/16/01 11:24:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=184.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Specs and Death</span><hr size=1> Since I don’t think killing “lowbies” is all that hilarious, I simply went to the OOT and pulled the Spec’s to Sister Island.

Specs will double-hit for 80s, kick, stun spell, and lifetap(30s).  However, the lifetap is about 50% of our casting range, and the stuns are melee range.

If you're fast on a resist you can snare the resisters and regroup then for a full snare.  If you wait even 20 seconds, you're better off just med-kiting (with no damage output) until BoF wears off an rerounding up.<br><br>I like using the water's edge area, with an F9 view hanging out over the water.  Easy to see what I'm doing.<br>At L45, 198 INT and about 60 in +mana (sad, I know) I can drop the whole quad in -1- BoF if I intersperse 2-3 Column of Lightnings in to the Circle of Force.  While Circle of Force is more mana-efficient, the extra couple Columns will allow you to not have to resnare unless something goes amiss.<br><br>If you get 2 dead, and 2 left, and you're VLOM, root one, back off, and harvest.   Once you break up the duo and they're low on health they'll get out of &quot;social&quot; range of each other and into hold/flee mode.  Don't let them regen to the point that they re-agro, but you can harvest/med up, DD one, root the other again, and finish it.<br><br><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Spell Load</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>Shock of Lightning<br>Enstill (Longer hold than root)<br>Bonds of Force<br>Column of Lightning<br>Circle of Force<br>Harvest<br>Yonder<br>Gate<br><br>For adds, simply ensill the add and quad the specs away from it.   Usually you can get out of range of the add before enstill breaks, but if it comes back just re-enstill, finish the quad, and deal with it(kill/zone).  If you get an add, obviously, you'll have to re BoF the quad at some point.<br><br>1.2-2.0 blues per quad at level 44, about 0.8 blues per quad at 45.  Hopefully that'll go back up to at least 1.0-1.5 at 46, but we'll see.<br><br>Specs have 10gp-4pp each, and scythes which range from 1gp - 10pp. (Rusty-bronze-regular)  I'm getting a LOT of runes/words/pages from the quads, too.  Much higher drop rate than anything in OT.<br><br>-Szii Uln'hyrr <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uennyaorcsbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ennya Orcsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/3/02 11:21:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=184.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Specs</span><hr size=1> I pulled specs in Oasis till the tower pulls were not too bad, then I want to OOT and the spawn timer and mana regen were perfect, and they are the same type of specs as are in the tower, not around the island. You can tell the difference by the tint of their &quot;face&quot;.<br><br>I would warn people I was pulling specs and that was usually enough. Occationally I would get someone helping who didn't ask first. I would apologise after they died that I couln't help them, and ask them not to do it again as I may not be able to clean up the mess because of it. And yes, I would laugh my ass off if they walked into a spec.<br><br>Now here is the strangest thing I ever saw:<br>Textbook Quad south of the lake in Oasis. Was only last nuke or 2 and all 4 specs turn to an orc warrior wandering nearby, and lifetap it to death.
