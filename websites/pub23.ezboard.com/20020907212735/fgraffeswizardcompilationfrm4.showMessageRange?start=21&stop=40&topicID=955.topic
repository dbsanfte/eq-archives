I did?  Have you seriously read anything I've posted or did you just see [60 sorcerer] triton and decide it's flame time?  I'm starting to wonder... I've said, several times, that focus items need to be distributed with the proper power attribute (not necessarily most powerful at 60 mind you, I think levels 1-44 need a focus item that gives a greater dmg percentage boost because their spells are less effected by a small percentage boost) at <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> all levels</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and they shouldn't be rare.

There's a difference between making an encounter trivial with a dropped object then one being trivial with a looted one.  If you can't understand what the difference is then there is no point in continuing this discussion with you.  Besides, it's not about trivialization, it's about making something much easier than it was meant to be.  Trivialization and &quot;easier&quot; are two different things.<br>

So I'm 60 and in an uber guild... your point?  I'm not seeing it.  First of all I'm not in the minority.  The opinion on focus items and their power is split right down the middle at the moment.  The people being most vocal about this, however, are the ones that want something for nothing.  If you thought for one second they were going to introduce an item into the game as a purchasable, summoned item and not tweak it a bit, you were kidding yourself.  No one was responsible for the nerf, people just assume that because they saw people bitching about it.  The nerf would have occurred even if no one had said anything... and do you people even comprehend the nature of the nerf?  The nerf in no way effected Wizards... well, except now you can't use the bracer with right clicks (effect &quot;ubers&quot; more than anyone else), you can't use them with banes (*gasp* ubers effected), and spells below 4.0 casting and above 9.5 casting are no longer effected by spell haste (no more 2.5 second casting draughts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>

  <br>
   5 or 6 whining ubers against 99% percent of the game.   You decide, seems like a clear minority for the ubers.  No, it's not split down the middle.  This is a clear case of Verant caving into a whining idiot.  My point is, but you won't want to see it, is you're reacting the same way.  You don't want summoned stuff to be better than stuff that drops off of Vulak.     <br>
<br>
You say only Furor is right because, much like many of the other people in raid every day guilds, you've forgotten there are 59 levels before 60.    This is what they were aimed at.   Not giving some guilds that would soon be ready to do these mobs anyway a quicker chance at competing with you.<br>
   <br>
   No, uber mobs didn't drop any faster, and the guilds that did them would have done the mobs whether or not the focus items were in the game.  I think primal is unbalanced, but I'm not calling out for a nerf, like you, simply because a group of 60's can tear through Sebilis frogs, with the cleric barely breaking a sweat. (I've seen it.)   <br>
<br>

Actually, uber mobs did drop faster with the focus items, a few main tanks that should have been dropped stayed alive because of the 8.5 second cheals.<br>

I've seen groups of 60s without primal tear through half of seb using a druid as a primary healer.  Hell, even Furor thinks primal shouldn't have been put into the game.<br>

Ok once again it appears that people still haven't actually read anything that Furor or Rombus has posted.  Please reread their posts.<br>

Furor's comments were directly linked to CH casting faster.  Are you seriously saying you think CH, the most powerful spell in the game, should cast faster, and that there should have NO adjustment to these items?  I mean really THINK about that, it's insane!  Did you even read Furor's comments?  Did you read the long, well-reasoned clarification he posted after the first obvious flame-bait?  Or are you just reacting to his name and rep and the rep of FoH?  <br>

Ummmm wrong, there are reports from uberguilds all over that encounters were won much FASTER and easier with focus items.<br>

Oh, the irony is killing me.  Furor himself states in multiple places in just that one thread alone that he feels primal is overpowered.  And who cares what a group of level 60s can do?  They are level 60 for god's sake, there shouldn't be many places regular shmoes go for xp that they couldn't plow through.<br>

<br>
You are forgetting that these items had unintended consequences for the end game and that is why they were changed.  And if focus items make it easier for smaller guilds to complete tough encounters, that does a couple things. First, it just GIVES them power that they didn't work for.  People who don't see that that is wrong are the same types that want Vulak loot to drop from spiderlings.  Second, it increases competion, spawn disputes, and general animosity among the entire server, and Veeshan has enough of that shit already.<br>
<br>
Thoughtful focus items need to be added as real gear for all levels.  Encounters must be tuned to compensate.  CH should not have it's casting time reduced.  And uber gear should be better than something a mage summons, else what is the point? <p>Luxum Aeturnum - Delharen D'Oloth<BR>

the main problem is that mages can't summon loads of 23% haste belts.  (20% haste mask, yeah, pet only) <br>
<br>
they are not saying no loot of lower mobs, foci only off dragons, they are saying the best loot should come off the hardest mobs, this is the way it always has been, you don't get myth two handers from the orc camps in EC (unless I popped the leatherfoot and felt like being an ass)<br>

You don't want competition.  Geez, they weren't *that* good.  The guilds that did kill Tunare and AoW with these would have killed them anyway *without* them.  Other guilds will eventually become uber with or without mages being able to summon these items.  Guilds at the top will fall.   If you can't handle competition like that, get out of the high end game. <br>
<br>
       These changes no longer affect me, but can I be angry for casters who have long waited for improvements like this, only to see them get nerfed simply because Furor complained?  <br>
<br>
       If they had said simply, 'ooops, we goofed' without guilds like Triton, Fires of Heaven and others complaining about  it, do you even think there would be such an outcry?   No, the timing was poor, and it's making them look like they caved in to about less than 5% of the player base.   People are angry because, here's the best bit:  when it comes to actual balancing for *groups*, they should in no way be listened to. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=955.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=955.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=955.topic&start=61&stop=66>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=955.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=955.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=955.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=955.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=955.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=955.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=955.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Luclin Spell Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Luclin Faction Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Luclin Quest Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Luclin Item Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
