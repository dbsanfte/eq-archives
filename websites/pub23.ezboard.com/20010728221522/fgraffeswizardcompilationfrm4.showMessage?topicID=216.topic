You die, you ask for a rez.  You are 2 or 3 hours of walking away from your destination, you ask for a port.  Either that or ask for a sow.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of telling people your porting rate ahead of time.  I just look at porting as a plat per hour issue.  Don't get upset.  Make a macro that reads:<br>
<br>
/reply Sure, I will be happy to port you.  My current fee is 50pp.<br>
<br>
Or whatever.  Shift-SomeNum then SomeNumber are 3 keys you have to press to inform the person you will port for profit.<br>
<br>
I don't understand the attitude of, &quot;I'm a wizard - I hate porting!&quot;  Everyone has bad experiences with beggars and prima donnas who expect everything handed to them.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm simple-minded.  I look at everything as a way to profit.  Either my wallet or my reputation profit from almost everything I do.  Even refusing to port people.  If warrior01 knows I cost 10pp for a port when I'm medding at the spires versus 500pp when I'm grouped with friends hunting... oh, I dunno.<br>
<br>
This post started as a rant and just kinda turned into a brain fart.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Can't wait till I'm of high enough level to charge people 1k for a port to the planes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ualyssandra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alyssandra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/01 9:00:02 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do I play the taxi?</span><hr size=1> Let me put this in perspective <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Yesterday evening I log in and was in FV.  My guild and my eq husbands guild hunt a lot together and it was epic night for us.  So while I waited on him to finish his transaction someone, in fact two people asked me for a ride.  When I have nothing to do and they offer me money I will do it.  One of the people found a ride which was cool.  Other one gave me 100pp to take him to N Karana.<br>
<br>
Now when I landed in NK was where trouble started.  My server has some uber guilds that apparently feel a wizard is to be at their beck and call.  When I got free time I don't mind doing it but about only time I do it for free is when someone really needs help like CR.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind I have a Paladin and I learned the zones and have run them when I was unable to buy a port.  I don't whine directly to a person.  What happened is this:<br>
<br>
I land and I get asked in say... can you translocate me?  How any tank be unaware how irritating this is to <br>
wizards is beyond me.  First off he should have said it in ooc and not asked me directly.  So I calmly sent him a tell and asked for a donation.  Now this guy is in an uber guild, and he tells me, I am a monk and I don't have any coin.  <br>
<br>
So I chose to gate as I was in a hurry.  Maybe I should have told him I was busy, but it was the way in which he approached me.  Like I was a wizard and therefore I should translocate him.  I was also on roleplay which didn't seem to stop this dude any.  So I land in DL and not only do I get a few tells from him but from one of his guildmates.  So I told my guild and next thing I hear is.  Well if you ever need your corpse pulled from a tough spot I won't do it for you.<br>
<br>
Now at this point my guild got into it with the person and our mediator in the guild later that night had a discussion with one of their members.  Those two probably going to hear from their guild leader about this.<br>
<br>
Here is the thing tho... I did a mana calculation and a translocate saps me of 10% of my mana.  Now if one person asks for a translocate that isn't a problem.  But what if 5 or 6 do?  Then you have a situation that they want it for free and there you have to sit and med when you are there to play a game.  I do not believe asking for a donation should have resulted in this sort of behavior.<br>
<br>
I got told not only was I selfish but I was discourteous not to give him the translocate.  Obviously they subscribe to the theory that wizards are in the game for THEIR benefit.  Exactly the sort of thing I have been fearing ever since these spells have come out.<br>
<br>
I personally will only translocate friends and guildmates and before and after raids.  My down time takes away from something I can be doing for ME.  My guild leaders response was... they want a porter they can run a wizard on another account <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway that is my 2 coppers about the port business.  Sorry for the rambling.<br>

Big deal that the guild asked you to go to Plane of Air. Hell, they even offered to compensate you. If I wasn't busy doing something and someone asked me and they were paying for the stone, then I would have found myself in PoA. <br>
<br>
I for one do not accept money for teleports. Either I can port them, or I can't but I don't charge. Why? Well because by helping others I have found that it has come back around and really helped me, ie. people helping with my epic when called upon, gained friends out of it, free res's, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
I know it can be annoying to be asked for ports all the time, but it doesn't hurt to help people on occassion either. And hey you might even make a friend out of it. /shrug<br>

Lately I've gotten people asking me to leave my camps or get off boats to come get them... it's ridiculous and of course I won't.

I have seen druids do much worse.  I just ignore people.<br>
<br>
I have been told I needed to bind myself at the FP docks to port some guy to GFay because he didn't feel like riding the boat across OOT and then running through Butcher.<br>

I have been told that I would be reported for not leaving my group and porting some whiney assed ranger.  (Bet the guide had a good laugh over that /petition.)<br>

I have been told I needed to run across two zones with some guy (one was Kith and it was 2AM game time) because he wanted a port back to GFay when he was done in Misty.<br>

But I am not draconian. I do translocates and sometimes i get thrown a few coins. Sometimes i get asked with proper tells for ports - &quot;i'll give you 165pp for a port to CS if you are not busy&quot;. To me, that is how you ask, not &quot;i need a port to DL&quot; or &quot;can I get a port?&quot; or &quot;are you busy?&quot;.  The latter three examples show lack of forthought on the part of the person asking.<br>
<br>
When i play my bard, and I am in FV and want to get to GD, i will AUCTION for a port and say /auction &quot;100pp for a port to GD&quot; and wait. Normally I get a response. If not, I will head to DL and do the same. I NEVER ask a druid or wizard directly for a port, it is just intrusive.<br>
<br>
Incidently, I do get abuse from people for not porting, along the lines of &quot;you are a typical wizard asshole&quot;, and I have had so much abuse and they are /report and /petition immediately from me. But I do take that to another level and sometimes agree to port them and take them to Toxx. No this does not get you banned, and not even a warning, it normally ends up with a GM answering your petition and them telling you that it was more than they could have done.<br>
<br>
Dont take crap from expectant people. If they are abusing you, port them to toxx, and /ignore them.<br>

Do I port everyone who asks me? Nope. Those who start off with &quot;Can I get a port to DL plz?&quot; or &quot;Culd u port me 2 DL plz?&quot; I just either ignore or tell them I'm busy. If they are an orge or troll and do the second to me I tell them to knock the roleplay stuff of and speak normal so I can understand them. If they are roleplay or not a troll or ogre I usually ignore them. Why? If you can't take the time to say &quot;Can I get a port to DL, please?&quot; so I can easily understand you, why should I port you? Not only are you gonna take up my time, but you are gonna annoy me with your inability to type completely. Sure, its shorter, and saves time. But how long? Half a second? If they come on demanding and see me as there for their own transportation use, I ignore them.<br>
-I have been told to gate back and TL someone.<br>
-I have been told to run to Fear and pick up someone for an evac to S Ro<br>
-I have been told to TP to Hate to help evac the CR team<br>
-I have been told to run to Everfrost Peaks to TP someone to Tox.<br>
-I have been told to run to East Commons to TP someone to Nek Forest.<br>
-I have been told to leave my group, TP someone to S Ro so they can make it in time for a raid in Oasis.<br>
<br>
I'm sure everyone has had expierences like those. Right? Notice how these are normally the demanding people too? Hence, I ignore them. Biggest kick I got out of a TP request was:<br>
Begger: &quot;Can u TP me to IC, plz?&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Whats up?&quot;<br>
Begger: &quot;I just died.&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Okay. And?&quot;<br>
Begger: &quot;I need to get my corpse before it rots.&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;You have more than ample time to take the boat.&quot;<br>
Begger: &quot;Plz dude.&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Listen, I just came from a very bad wipe out in Chardok and my corpse is right dab slap infront of the Overking as I ran like hell to save the clerics. I need to get my own corpse from a worse position.&quot;<br>
Begger: &quot;This will only take a second.&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Sure, with your ungodly fast CPU it might only take me a second. But I gotta med up, take you to IC, kill whatever is at the ring for you without getting more, then leaving. I figure you could suck up to 10 minutes of time.&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Plus theres a risk factor, mana factor. Can you pay me?&quot;<br>
Begger: &quot;No. Plz d00d&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Nope, sorry.&quot;<br>
Begger: &quot;I guess Mr. All High and Mighty Taxi is too good to port the rest of us non-TPers around. Fine then, see if I help you ever&quot;<br>
<br>
That last remark really struck a nerve and he was promptly<br>
put on my ignore list. I find out later he is level 10. Now I ask you - What is a level 10 doing in Iceclad? A snow bunny most likely killed him.<br>
<br>
But changing the subject, how do you handle TP requests, when you ask for them, on your twinks? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukeiote.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keiote</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/01 5:00:46 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.graffe.com/darkmoon/keiote_sasnic_ani_3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Do I play the taxi?</span><hr size=1> Keiote: /guildsay &quot;Hey Graffe you busy?&quot;<br>

<br>
I'm sure it's just me but I've grouped with a wizard for 51 levels, I know the potential of what the wizard brings to the group. Teleporting is not a group contribution and I dont care how you try to look at it. I put my life in Graffe's hands almost everynight and visa versa. If there is anything that needs to be done for the wizard to make them more group friendly and not just a taxi... address the agro factor on mobs. Graffe will have 50m to my OOM by the end of a good fight. Why? Becasue if he casts anymore he pulls agro. <br>
__________________________________________________________<br>
<br>
The translocate spells are a blessing for wizzy's but it is a side issue. I think too much attention is being put on them. I get the same idiot noobs asking for rez's.<br>
&quot; Sure drag your corpse to me...&quot; &quot; but it's 3 zones away &quot;<br>
/ignore<br>
I'm pulling for you wizzy's to get something worthwhile to where you can tell people you cant port them because you cant leave your GROUP right now.<br>

I've never /auc'd ports for cash, and I've never explicitly charged a fee for a port.  Sometimes when it's a total stranger, I tell them &quot;I'll port you for free, donations are accepted&quot;.  Usually a guildie, freind, or anyone in a guild I respect just gets &quot;I'll take you for free&quot;, and I won't accept the donations from guildies and freinds, although I don't turn down whatever anyone else wants to give me for my &quot;free&quot; service.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is it's good PR and a nice way to make freinds.  And I bet I still make more money from ports than most people.  Hell, the other day a random stranger was so surprised by me porting them to GD for free that they gave me a Crystal Webshield and wouldn't take it back - stuff like that happens on a regular basis.  I generally turn down ports when I'm busy (be it solo or group) unless it's a CR or something else important, unless someone actually offers enough money to make it worth my time - but I still never tell them I need money to change my mind or how much.<br>
<br>
That being said - I still have trouble with groups.  It sure doesn't help your grouping to charge for ports - but even given my porting practices, I haven't been in more than one non-guild group a week for some time.  But then again, I don't look very hard anymore, I kinda gave up on it.<br>

In fact, I've probably promoted bad behaviour since chances are I would port you if you sent a direct tell but wouldn't if you simply &quot;/ooc looking for a port to GD&quot;.<br>
<br>
I also rarely charged money and in fact have cancelled most trade windows when money was offered.<br>
<br>
Having said that I have observed a few things:<br>
<br>
i) Being a generous porter has never gotten me a group.  IMO we're kidding ourselves if we think people haven't forgotten our names 10 seconds after they've reached their destination and are eagerly playing the game.<br>
ii) People react more negatively to a refused port than they react positively to a given port.  When I port someone the most I usually get is a &quot;thks&quot; or a &quot;/bow&quot;.  Once however, while fighting in the Burning Wood I received a tell from a 55ish player asking for a port out since they didn't have sow.  I was in a group at the time so I responded &quot;sorry man can't leave my group but if you come to us we can give you a sow&quot;.  He then began to give me crap and the usual &quot;see if you get any help from me in the future&quot; crap.  Ironically, he was a cleric and I wonder if he just dumps his group whenever he gets a tell for a rez.<br>
iii) People will expect you to leave your group to port.<br>
iv) If you are in a remote location and can't port since it would take you 30 minutes or more to return to the location people will expect you to bind where you are regardless of how inconvenient the spot is or how convenient your current bind point is.<br>
v) People think that Translocates are a right.<br>
<br>
All in all I have probably generated more ill will in the 20% of the ports I have refused than goodwill that I have generated from the 80% of the ports I have given.  That is sad to say the least.<br>
<br>
I now simply reply with &quot;sorry...busy&quot;.  While it may not make me any new aquaintances it certainly saves me the aggravation of the many jerks out there who will berate you for a refusal.<br>

I charge a set amount, but if someone can convince me to make an excpeption, I usually will.  Ports for CR, if asked for politely, are always free.<br>
<br>
The reason I do this is to reinforce the idea that our ports are a privilege, not an entitlement.  I am under no obligation to port anyone anywhere.  If you ask me nicely, I'll probably port you for a token price, and sometimes for free.<br>
<br>
Remember, teleporting is a service, just like resurrection and SoW.  It's not unreasonable to expect compensation for services rendered. <p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
