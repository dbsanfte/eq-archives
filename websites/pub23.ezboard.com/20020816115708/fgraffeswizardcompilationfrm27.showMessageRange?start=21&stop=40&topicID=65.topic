<br>
I started a Wizzard by the name of EbonyKing. I am level 10 now and have No idea what the hell I'm doing (I know, I know, why subject myself to the horror to follow). I never leveled any character past 27 (BeastLord) on any server, largely do to my short attention span. <br>
<br>
Well, all of that is changing now, becuase of the intruig of PVP. I have been playing on Rallos ever since I created my char 4 weeks ago. I haven't even logged onto my old server to give friends there a final goodbye.<br>
<br>
I've read about all of the posts on this thread and have some questions, if your high level excellency could be most gracious on your humble observer and bless him with advise (nothing wrong with suckin up), I'd be eternally gracious.<br>
<br>
1. What are these Discs, that everyone has been talking about tossing at wizzards?<br>
2. What are Golem Wands???<br>
3. How many hours/days/weeks/years/decades does it take to build a 60th level Wizzard on Rallos??<br>
4. What the hell are Lures, and why have I been told there unresistable in pvp?<br>
5. What are AA Skills?<br>
6. Any other advise for a young wizzard is welcome.<br>
<br>
I'm very sorry to dirty up this nice, informative thread, but I am really into this PVP thing, with all its weeknesses and could use some advise/incentive to stick with it this time.<br>
<br>
I was about to post this message on another website, but this thread seemed to be the only on I've ever seen without a single flammer, which is remarkable. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujj8emup.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jj8emup</A> at: 6/20/02 11:29:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukainite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kainite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/21/02 6:59:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Short version</span><hr size=1> &quot;1.

No offense, but you live under a rock? Most of these questions are the bread and butter for each class. Rather than make a huge post about what each of these are, I suggest you go to eqcastersrealm.com and look them up. That will answer 90% of your questions..

No need to flame people for their lack of knowlege.<br>
<br>
1. What are these Discs, that everyone has been talking about tossing at wizzards?<br>
<br>
&quot;Discs&quot; (disciplines) are abilities unique to melee classes at the 50+ levels. Each one has a duration (for example, 30 seconds) and an effect. After the discipline is used, it can't be reused for a fixed amount of time (like Harm Touch). Some effects include: being able to dodge all melee attacks, being able to riposte every attack, etc. Some disciplines -- such as rogues' Duelist discipline -- are extremely deadly, especially when used against casters.<br>
<br>
2. What are Golem Wands???<br>
<br>
Golem wands are items that used to drop off a golem in the Temple of Cazic-Thule. They have 5 charges of the spell Pillage Enchantment, which removes 3-4 buffs. Golem wands used to be insta-cast. That is, you could instantly get rid of all your opponent's buffs by clicking your golem wand on him a few times. Due to the recent nerf (they now have a 4-second casting time), they are far less useful.<br>
<br>
3. How many hours/days/weeks/years/decades does it take to build a 60th level Wizzard on Rallos??<br>
<br>
A lot -- I'd estimate 30 days played at the very least. Some Rallos wizards here might be able to give you a better answer.<br>
<br>
4. What the hell are Lures, and why have I been told there unresistable in pvp?<br>
<br>
Lures are 52+ wizard spells that are near-unresistable in PvE, and unresistable in PvP. By &quot;unresistable&quot; that means they always do their full amount of damage. So if I had a fire resist of, say, 150, Lure of Flame would still do its maximum 403 damage, while Draught of Fire (a more resistable spell) might do considerably less. As a consequence of their being unresistable, Lures are a mana-inefficient way of doing damage.<br>
<br>
5. What are AA Skills?<br>
<br>
AA skills are a way for 51+ characters to (roughly) exchange their experience points for new abilities. You earn an &quot;ability point&quot; each time you fill up your alternate-advancement experience bar, and each ability costs a certain number of ability points. An oft-discussed AA skill on this forum is Manaburn, a wizard-only skill possessing the ability to instantly kill another player.<br>
<br>
But don't level up a wizard with the intention of getting Manaburn. According to Verant, the ability of Manaburn to instakill another player in PvP is a bug that &quot;slipped through the cracks&quot; and will most certainly be nerfed in the future.<br>

The points board was generally dominated by level 30 - 40 druids who could snare people around there level range because they had poor MR.<br>
Once you land a snare on your opponent the fight is all but over.  After opponents get decent resists though, snare will hardly ever land and makes things much more complicated.  A monkey could be trained to kill a snared opponent.  With the advent of manaburn, level 60 wizards found that burn, instagate, then reapply 2 hours later was a very effective tactic to gain points and involved little to no risk at all.  While the points board does not indicate who is necessarily the *best* pkers on the server it does indicate who pk's alot and is somewhat effective at it. <p><img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Chris+Cojocar/fullsize/horse.jpg" border="0">

I do not think we lack for anything and are a competitive class.  We can be beaten and we can win...which is how it should be.  <br>
<br>
As a manaburn wizard I can safely say Manaburn at the least should be disallowed for looting rights on a PvP kill.   manaburn trivializes PvP so the wizard gets no respect for victories.  In group pvP, however, I see how manaburn often plays an important roll in strategy, so I am reluctant to have them compeltely remove it from pvP as it gives us a JOB or an identity in group PvP.<br>
<br>
Let's face it, a cleric healing ANYONE versus our nukes makes wizards a joke in pvP, so in big group encoutners our nukes are somewhat frivilous to the often 4 to 7k hps of players who are getting Celstial Elixered and CHd.  manaburn allows us to take out a cleric right away from the battle which at least makes us useful.<br>
<br>
I don't think we are weak in pvP, but your story was lopsided ;p <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usollaiel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sollaiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/29/02 9:28:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well</span><hr size=1> Nerfing manaburn is acceptable, if the PvP resists are nerfed as well.. <br>

<br>
Your position doesn't make sense.<br>
<br>
Verant nerfed spell dmg to 2/3 to correct an imbalance.<br>
<br>
How does it follow that a measure, any measure is required to correct that very justified balance decision?<br>
<br>
Let me outline just how much spell dmg wizards would put out if the 2/3 measure didn't exist.  This assumes you have dmg focus obtainable from your friendly neighborhood mage.<br>
<br>
Lure of Ice             =1k unresistable<br>
Crit Lure of Ice       = 2k unresistable<br>
Half Resisted SS      = 970<br>
Full Damage SS       = 1940<br>
Crit Half resisted SS = 1940<br>
Crit Full Damage SS  = 3880<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is why spell dmg is nerfed to 2/3.  Don't expect any compensation for this... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukainite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kainite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/31/02 6:30:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A few flaws in your calculations....</span><hr size=1> Spell crits are fairly rare, so I dont think it's fair to factor them in, unless you are willing to factor in double backstabs from horendous damage weapons (Tantor's Tusk type or better). Lure's are NOT unresistable, incredibly hard to resist. I have HAD my Lure's totally resisted (yes it has not happened more than say 5% tops), but to say 100% resisted is a bit skewed. BUT, I do agree with the damage nerf for spell damage, the problem as we all have agreed on the most, is twinkage for the resists. Without the damage nerf (and the twinkage), spells just did too much damage and ended the fight before it ever began, surprise or no surprise. That was it's intended purpose, mostly for lower levels, when nukes would flat out kill you in 3 or less casts, regardless of class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=65.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showMessageRange?topicID=65.topic&start=41&stop=42>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showPrevMessage?topicID=65.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showNextMessage?topicID=65.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.emailToFriend?topicID=65.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.threadControl?topicID=65.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=65.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=65.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Luclin Spell Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Luclin Faction Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Luclin Quest Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Luclin Item Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
