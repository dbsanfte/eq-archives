I'm sure there are Christians who will tell me this is because I'm merely human and cannot comprehend the ineffable nature of the divine (and stuff). I don't buy that either. While there are many things we do not understand, I have yet to be convinced that there is anything inherently unknowable.<br>
<br>
Were I, for the sake of argument, to accept the concept of such a being...I find it unlikely in the extreme that an entity able to shape universes, to create matter/energy from the void and breathe the spark of life into this far-flung cosmos would be concerned with the worship or obedience of the tiny mote that is our species. Talk about micromanagement. <br>
<br>
If I am incorrect, and there is in fact such a being who does in fact find it so important that I acknowledge and worship it, there are a thousand ways in which I could be convinced. Letters of fire 300 feet high across the Cascade mountain range saying something along the lines of, &quot;I am the Lord, believe in me and my works&quot; would do it quite handily.<br>
<br>
Faith? You mean this alleged creator, who knows all and loves all and has power over all not only demands my worship but insists I must produce it by intuiting the existence of its object or accepting beyond reason the quasi-evidence of some ancient texts, translated through unnumbered permutations?<br>
<br>
If I am in fact the product of some deliberate act of creation (beyond my parents' hanky-panky), then I was created with the capacity for reason. If there is in fact such a thing as sin, I would have to suppose that refusal to use my reason might well qualify. <p>Chesse Shardic<BR>

Good stuff, Torcer.<br>
<br>
Maybe the point I'm trying to make is that a clear-thinking Christian (wow, I'm certainly loading the dice there) is hard-pressed to rule out the existence of Zeus without resorting to a kind of &quot;Because he just doesn't exist!&quot;-type argument.  The irony is that the same argument can be turned on their own belief about God.<br>

<br>
Torcer, the ~identity~ of the god of a person of faith is established via a piece of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anecdotal evidence</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, namely whatever written or verbal teachings have made it through the years.   (In the case of the bible, mutated, dare i say, evolved? &lt;grin&gt; )  A modern religious person doesn't just figure these things out via a moment of eureka, hmm?  No, they have faith in what they were taught, and they were taught by anecdotal evidence.  For instance the bible (referring to both the christian and judaic books) is a collection of books isn't it?  It wasn't ~written~ by God, it was written by people who claimed to know the will of God.  <br>

How is it even remotely possible that there is one and only one answer to life's universal questions?  Why would a benevolent god summarily doom to hell the majority of people on this earth not because they were evil, but because they were unlucky enough to be born into the &quot;wrong&quot; culture and be performing the &quot;wrong&quot; rituals or calling to the &quot;wrong&quot; name?

<br>
I was the average 20 year old loved women sex beer and wanted to make money and make a nice life for myself and that special girl when I happened to meet her.<br>
<br>
One day my dad invites me to church on fathers day so I decide to go just to make him feel good sort of a fathers day gift.<br>
<br>
I sat through praise and worship didn't stand up just sat and looked around.  Before I knew it I felt this burden or hard pressing feeling on my heart.  Might I say there was no sermon preached that day at all so no preacher got me all hyped up and messed with my emotions as some think they do but actually I understand the body language and shouting.  <br>
<br>
THere was no sermon preached at all but the pastor of that church said &quot;If there is anyone here who is not involved in the church just stand or I will come to you and talk.&quot;  I felt something telling me to stand up but I didn't I refused to stand I would feel embarrassed.  So one usher came to me and stood me up and said &quot;When I am dead and gone we need young people like you to do all this work&quot;  he was smiling when he said it.  <br>
<br>
The rest is history the point I am making here dear friends is that God himself will reveal himself to you and draw you to him then reveal his Son Jesus to you.  <br>
<br>
I did pleanty of research and know there is a Christ he died and did rise again.  I hear of many different men who were wise but they all died and are still in the grave waiting for the day of judgement.<br>
<br>
&quot;No man can come to me unless the father draws him to me..&quot;  Was the words Jesus spoke in John chapter 6.  Was the bible altered?  If men wrote the bible then there could be errors?  Lets think about this God created the universe couldn't he keep his word pure and keep men from altering it?  I think if he can keep breath in my body and my heart pumping the earth rotating the clouds moving if he can raise the dead free men from addictions if the blind see lepers cleansed I think he can keep his word from being altered.<br>
<br>
I myself belong to no religious oragnization meaning I am not baptist methodist any of those things.  In fact  denominations just cause devision among men.<br>
<br>
The bible predicts many things and many things have come to pass.  If you just look at america for example the transition it has made and the things we see on television would have never been shown in the 50's and 60's it seems no one blushes anymore at all.  Paul speaks of this in romans the first chapter.  <br>
<br>
I can condemn no man or call any man anything b/c I myself have had my share of mistakes and downfalls.  If you choose to believe there is no God then you have the right too make that choice but you can't choose where you go when you die.  There is no in between and there is no plea in God's court.  The only thing you can do as of right now is plea GUILTY and then he will save you by his grace.<br>
<br>
Once again if you ever feel like he's pulling on you and trying to get your attention I beg you to pay attention and get to know him for yourself.  I can answer any questions best I know how I am on mith marr and can be found easily.  <br>
<br>
I know there is a God and his Son did die for the sins of the world.  &quot;Through one man sin entered and through one man sin will leave...&quot;  How do I know he's real?  <br>
My friends I have had a personal experience that no man could explain but my pastor and the word of God made it much more clear to me.  <br>
<br>
Don't look at this post  in a negative way just me sharing my personal experience and if you want to have a relationship with your creator tell Him and He will answer your plea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Uh yes, the bible HAS been altered considerably over the years.  It is a translation of a translation of a translation, and as such there have been changes to the meaning of various passages due to translator's error and the meddlings of the Roman Catholic church in the middle ages.

This really doesn't mean much. The area hasn't led us to any sort of conclusion as to what god is. It's probably befuddled the issue more than anything else.<br>
<br>
Like I said earlier in response to this, the brain is too complex and we don't really know enough about it to actually claim anything has been proven about most of it's processes.<br>
<br>
This area you've written about is probably just an area that becomes active when somebody contemplates things they don't understand. It would be interesting to see what else would trigger that same area of the brain.<br>

All you really need to do is look at the different versions of the bible to see how the translations differ. The difference between the Gideons and St James versions of the bible has everything to do with the translation.<br>

Also.. From what I understand, the greek translation (for example) of the sermon on the mountain is completely different than the english versions translation.. in the St James version. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umandari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandari</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.nc.rr.com/prismites/icon1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/02 8:47:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=112>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.nc.rr.com/prismites/icon1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My dear friends</span><hr size=1> Phuong:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The rest is history the point I am making here dear friends is that God himself will reveal himself to you and draw you to him then reveal his Son Jesus to you. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Given the number of agnostics, atheists, Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Hare Krishnas, Zoroastrians, etc that pass away each year without changing their belief system, it seems the revelation needs some serious tweaking.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Lets think about this God created the universe couldn't he keep his word pure and keep men from altering it?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
One would think so, but that historically has not been the case.  The various religions can't even decide which books to include, much less how to translate them accurately.  Jude quotes the Book of Enoch, for instance, but Enoch is considered apocryphal while Jude is scripture (Enoch is some pretty whacky reading, btw).<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&quot;No man can come to me unless the father draws him to me..&quot; Was the words Jesus spoke in John chapter 6&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Okay, so we need God to call us to him.  Fair enough.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;If you choose to believe there is no God then you have the right too make that choice but you can't choose where you go when you die.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Waitaminute. You just said your god has to call us, but now you say it's our choice whether to believe or not.  This is highly contradictory.  You might respond that we choose whether to answer the call, but if the phone isn't ringing I'm not picking it up.  And obviously there are billions of people who've lived and  died since 33 A.D. who were never exposed to the gospels and whatnot.  What choice were they given before being damned?<br>
<br>
Tinthalas:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;All that I willl add to this thread is that there is a complex region of the brain that has no other purpose except to  think about god.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Odd.  I keep up on the scientific news with some regularity and have yet to hear of this.  In fact, if something like this *was* discovered, it would be on every front page on the face of the earth.  Please let us know who uncovered this...discovery.<br>
<br>
Stumpey:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Really? Show me how. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Here's one example, which Orakkus correctly aluded to (the diamond in the rough of his posts, as it were).  &quot;The most reliable early manuscripts and other ancient witnesses do not have Mark 16:9-20.&quot; (quoted from bible.gospelcom.net).  See, the original story ends with the women coming to the tomb and finding the rock rolled away.  They're alarmed, but a &quot;young man&quot; tells them that Jesus is risen and will meet them in Galilee.  The young man tells them to tell this to the disciples, but the last line is, &quot;Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, that's hardly an exciting way to end the story of the savior of humanity.  So later some addendums appeared, in which Jesus shows up to Mary, the Great Commision is given, and followers are told they can handle snakes and drink poison.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes translators don't like what they see, too, and add a word here or there to prevent the bible from contradicting itself.  Thus in some translations (NIV I think?) the word &quot;just&quot; shows up in Jeremiah and the word &quot;yet&quot; shows up in one of the Gospels.  I can extrapolate if you wish, in case you're not familiar with this.<br>

<br>
Yes if the phone rings you have a chance to pick it up.  Why do you think I came to a wizard board this morning my friend.  I play a monk I just felt I should come here this morning and look what I find.  God is drawing all the unsaved right now.  You are held accountable to the amount of light given to you.  Think of all the preachers you see on TV or some Christians who have witnessed to you.  What if a man never hears the gospel?  Then he couldn't possibly be sent to hell?  Yes if you have had no light how will you ever know you were in the dark.  <br>
<br>
Once again don't try to use your intellegence to figure out God's word b/c you will fail and use words like &quot;Contradiction&quot; hehe b/c the bible compliments itself.  If you have trouble reading some things in there have you prayed and asked for wisdom to understand the scriptures.  <br>
<br>
He will answer if your heart is willing to recieve.  Let's break this down.<br>
<br>
The passage &quot;If you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus is the Christ and was risen from the grave though shalt be saved.&quot;  Remember &quot;If you believe in your heart..&quot;  What does that mean.  The word &quot;believe&quot; also follows action my friends.<br>
<br>
If I say I &quot;believe&quot; Jesus is the Christ that means that you will start to see some changes in my life.  I will obey his words and do whatever God's will is for my life.  <br>
<br>
As far as changes to the bible goes doctrine is unchanged my friends it's how you interpert that doctrine.<br>
<br>
We are living in the days when God IS uncovering false religions for what they are.  People claiming to be God's child aren't at all if there actions don't show it remember to &quot;believe&quot; follows action.<br>
<br>
Does this mean saved men will not make mistakes?  No.  Men will make mistakes but learning from them is what we need to do.  <br>
<br>
Does this mean saved people don't have to sin?  Yes.  If you are saved you don't have to sin you CHOOSE to sin.  Example:  &quot;I didn't mean to sleep with her it just happened.&quot;  Sure you meant to no one was controlling you.  you &quot;believed&quot; sleeping with her would pleasure you so you did it.<br>
<br>
Once again I will say I condemn no man I was once a sinner a drunkard a glutton and a hater of all things good my friends.  you are talking to an ex drug dealer and ex alcoholic.  I wasn't expected to live past 22 in the neighborhood I grew up in.<br>
<br>
I remember watching some preachers drink and cuss in my neighborhood.  That's what they chose to do be false witnesses and steal from the church to get cadillacs and nice houses.<br>
<br>
God will judge them don't worry about them look in the mirrior make sure everything is right within yourself.<br>
<br>
As my dad says &quot;Every tub has to sit on it's on bottom.&quot; meaning every man must answer for himself.<br>
<br>
Remember people you live in America where we have the choice of free religion no one is persecuting you and stopping you from doing research.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you draw nigh to me I shall draw nigh to you.&quot;  And he will and if you are hearing not listening but hearing the gospel then he will beging to draw you.<br>
<br>
We must &quot;rightly divide the word of truth&quot;<br>
<br>
I ended up coming back home from work today hehe seems God has my eyes on this message board someone must have pleanty of questions here once again bring all questions and comments I will answer &quot;God wishes that none should perish..&quot; and so die.<br>
<br>
Thormir:<br>
<br>
I hope I answered some of your questions above.  As far as revelation goes read Daniel Chapter 7 then read revelation again.  It explains when the dead are raised for the big judgement.  Once you die it's heaven or hell my friends no in between.  This sounds contridictory but you have to read revelation in detail to understand I will come back and bring some scripture for you to take a look at that explains all this in more detail.<br>

<br>
Or perhaps it was the devil drawing you to set of false teachings?  Who knows, only the devil does.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Yes if the phone rings you have a chance to pick it up.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
But I'm telling you the phone isn't ringing.  BTW, I was raised a Christian and fully believed in much of what you are saying.  Then I did my research, applied a modicum of intelligence and logic, and realized that it was all bunk.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;What if a man never hears the gospel? Then he couldn't possibly be sent to hell? Yes if you have had no light how will you ever know you were in the dark.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
So you are saying that people who never hear the Gospel are NOT sent to hell?  Can you justify this via scripture?  <br>
<br>
It's not enough to tell me that the bible really does all work out and you just need to pray.  *Show* me how the contradictions are not contradictions.  And thank you, I *will* use my intelligence to examine your claims.  I refuse to turn off my brain even it means living in happy lala land.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;As far as changes to the bible goes doctrine is unchanged my friends it's how you interpert that doctrine.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Doctrine is unchanged it's how you interpret the doctrine.  Uh huh...  The bible has been used to promote and condemn all manner of actions, from slavery to drinking to the subjugation of women and conquering of enemies.  Interpretations change with the times.  It's a pretty flimsy set of ancient texts to build a code of morality upon.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;We are living in the days when God IS uncovering false religions for what they are. People claiming to be God's child aren't at all if there actions don't show it remember to &quot;believe&quot; follows action.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
And who judges who is Christian and who is not (other than Orakkus)?  You might answer god, but it isn't showing up in the paper.  Any person of any religion or no religion can live a fine life with fine actions. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Remember people you live in America where we have the choice of free religion no one is persecuting you and stopping you from doing research.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Yes, fortunately people like Thomas Paine and other Founding Fathers labored to prevent the US from turning into the sort of country where you were persecuted, tortured, ostracized or executed if you did not follow the local brand of Christianity.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I hope I answered some of your questions above.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well, you said a great deal, but didn't really answer anything.  &quot;Just pray&quot; is not an answer, it's an evasion.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; Once you die it's heaven or hell my friends no in between.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
This will really bum out the billions who never had a chance at being saved.  Reading Revelation is all well and good, but if I had a dollar for every distinct interpretation of Revelation and Daniel I would ensure the entire EZBoard world didn't have to look at another pop up add again and would still retire in comfort.<br>
<br>
Phuong, you feel the same kinds of sensations that Orakkus feels (who, I think, differs from you greatly on scriptural interpretation).  You feel the same way Mormons say they feel, and Pentecostals, and some Muslims and Jews, and Krishnas, and plenty of others, even the non-religious.  It's nice that you cleaned yourself up, and perhaps religion played a role in that.  But it does not validate your beliefs anymore than the raptures of others validates theirs.  <br>

<br>
Of course, we all know that each letter of the Hebrew alphabet is also a number. Well, the number 666 can also translate to Nero Caesar. I found this fascinating.. especially when considering that John wrote this during the reign of Nero. I would sugest that John's book really had nothing to do with prophecy but was rather a way to give the Christians of the time a scare and get them back in line with Christian teachings. This whole End Of The World stuff... it's one of the strangest aspects of Christianity to me.<br>
<br>
Did you know that the Book of Revelations was not originally included in the bible? Too much controversy. I don't remember when exactly it was added but I think it was around 500 A.D.

See Oglzogl's posts for some examples.
