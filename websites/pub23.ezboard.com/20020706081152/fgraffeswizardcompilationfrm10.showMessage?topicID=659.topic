<br>
I’ve been wracking my brain for some improvements I could suggest for the Wizard class.<br>
<br>
<br>
Suggestion One.<br>
<br>
At Level 34, we gain a great advantage for the Wizard Class: Harvest. This spell has been said to not scale properly after Level 50. Is this still the case? If so, that is the first fix I could suggest. That, or at Level 44 add a new spell Harvest II which has the same stats as Harvest I but returns 300-500 manna. And possibly add at 54 Harvest III. Again, same stats, but returns 600 manna. Or maybe make Harvest into a Skill, that way a spell slot may not be wasted with memorising a spell which many over Level 50 deem as a wasted slot. If it were a skill, people would continue to use it since it would no longer be rotting in a spell-slot. Perhaps add a Level 59 AA for Wizards: Ultimate Harvest. Refresh every 15 minutes, returns 500 manna. Similar to the Shaman AA skill Cannibalisation.<br>
<br>
<br>
Suggestion Two.<br>
<br>
Wizards are fabled to be the Masters of Direct Damage. This is just an off-the-cuff idea, but why not grant Wizards access to the NPC specific nukes. We already have the Porlor’s Fury and Hsargra’s Wrath spells which are NPC specific.<br>
<br>
How about the DD Vs. Summoned and Undead NPCs? These are harder to resist (supposedly) and more manna efficient than our regular nukes until the higher levels when the difference is negligible.<br>
<br>
Level 8: Ward Summoned/Undead<br>
Level 16: Expulse Summoned/Undead<br>
Level 24: Dismiss Summoned/Undead<br>
Level 34: Expel Summoned/Undead<br>
Level 44: Banish Summoned/Undead<br>
Level 55: Exile Summoned/Undead<br>
Level 60: Banishment/Banishment of Shadows<br>
<br>
It’s just a thought. This probably wouldn’t have much room for abuse since we get an all-purpose Banishment spell at Level 60, but the inherent bonuses of having NPC specific spells would apply. I’m sure not everyone will like this, but I think it’s a good idea since it isn’t really giving us better nukes at later levels, but just ones which are harder to resist (I think).<br>
<br>
<br>
Suggestion Three.<br>
<br>
I, along with many other Wizards, feel there is something missing. Wizards are one of the few magic based classes who cannot lower the resistance of their targets. The only other classes who cannot do this are the Cleric, the Paladin, the Shadow-Knight and the Beastlord. Three of these four classes are Hybrids and it is rarely their place to receive assistance in resistance debuffing. Magicians have infiltrated the realm of Shamen and acquired the Malise line of spells, decreasing Magic, Poison, Cold and Heat resistances even though they only receive spells in two of these four areas. The only consolation for Wizards is a quest which can be completed with some difficulty past Level 24. The Staff of Temperate Flux. However, the effect is not the greatest influence. At Level 24, Magicians can debuff 4 out of 5 resistances by roughly 18 points each with the expenditure of a small amount of manna. Wizards have a manna-free click effect which debuffs Heat and Cold by six points which is enough to notice a minor change in the ability for wizard’s spells to hit for more damage than usual. There is no debuffing of Magic Resistance, so this stick is rendered useless when trying to use the Level 20 DD spells like Force Shock and Garrison’s Mighty Manna Shock let alone the most widely used line of all: Root.<br>
<br>
I would like to make a suggestion for a new spell line.<br>
<br>
Since there is such a spell as remove Greater Curse now, and Wizards being loosely based on the occult (buzz-words like familiars and female wizards being referred to as witches by Alhakazham), then why not give them a weak curse line of spells?<br>
<br>
Say, for example,<br>
Level 16. Minor Curse: lowers Magic, Cold and Heat resistances by 10 each. 75 manna.<br>
Level 29: Lesser Curse: lowers Magic, Cold and Heat resistances by 20 each. 140 manna.<br>
Level 44: Curse: lowers Magic, Cold and Heat resistances by 30 each. 205 manna.<br>
Level 60: Greater Curse: lowers Magic, Cold and Heat resistances by 20 each (un-resistible). 280 manna.<br>
<br>
All but the Level 60 spell can be dispelled with the cancel magic line, but for interest make the Level 60 spell only dispellable with Remove Greater Curse. Other than that, it would last its normal five-minute (or so) duration.<br>
<br>
For argument’s sake, let’s make it not stack with any other magic/cold/heat debuff just like the Staff of Temperate Flux. They are quite manna heavy, that being a penalty for the Wizard getting the debuff. Also, why not give it a large casting time? Say, the same as Ice Comet or so? 7 seconds would make it less useful in a sudden ambush scenario.<br>
<br>
<br>
Suggestion Four (or 3.2)<br>
<br>
If the Curse line is not appealing, then I would suggest a minor change to the Staff of Temperate Flux. Change the click level to 30 and make it debuff Magic, Heat and Cold by 20. Give it a casting time (this will annoy those who use it for distance-judgement) and make it equippable in the Range Slot (equipped click-activation only). This would force players to choose between a ranged item and the Staff of Temperate Flux (aside from the right click, it would add the +5 Save vs. Cold/Heat).<br>
<br>
<br>
Suggestion Five.<br>
<br>
How about making the spell “Spell-Shield” a group spell like Blessing of Aegolism and Boon of the Garou. Maybe up the manna and reagent cost accordingly. This would just be to minimise the amount of manna/time Wizards have to spend buffing others. Since we’ve never had to do so before, we would want to get it over and done quickly. Then it would also make sense to give the Wizard the mass-group buff AA skill, since Magicians get it solely for their Aegis of Ro spell, we may as well get it for our Spell-Shield <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Suggestion Six.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of keeping Sunstrike as the most manna efficient DD Wizards get, but I would like to see the addition of a Level 59 AA skill which raises further the chance of Specialising in an Evocation-based spell. Or possibly allowing another Specialise Skill to exceed the 50 cap and raise to 100 or so. This would be helpful in the only other field where Wizards have essential combat spells: Alteration. So we would have Specialise Evocation at over 200, Specialise Alter at 100 and the other three (Divination, Abjuration and Conjuration) at 50.<br>
<br>
<br>
Suggestion Seven.<br>
<br>
Druids get the Class AA skill Enhanced Root which lowers the risk of breaking root with DD by 50%. I would like to see Wizards granted this ability too since we are more dependant and more specialised in Root skills than Druids, even if theirs has a DD component. We may get Strong Root, but I would still like to see Enhanced Root added. This would enhance our root spells in general, not just an emergency root once an EQ-Day.<br>
<br>
<br>
As you’re well aware these are just some random ideas thrown out by an idle player, but I do think that this is an area that Wizards have been overlooked.<br>

<br>
Or a bonus(which we USED to have an advantage in), that would let us land our DD spells more easily than other classes.  Or for wizards to be able to cast on mobs from any distance, and eliminate the idiotic melee range only on many mobs pre-Luclin.<br>

Keeping the low values you give (300-300-600), meming the 3 would give 1200 mana over 100 ticks, or 12 mana per tick, which is a self only C2... I guess that's a bit too much. A lvl 54 one giving back 140 every 7 minutes (or any other 2 mana per tick combination) with no stun time would seem more reasonnable. That would already be a 5 mana per tick regen which ain't that bad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Suggestion 2:<br>
That is mages and clerics specialty really... I'm fine without those. I'd much rather see the draughts scale up to 800 as suggested in &quot;the document&quot;.<br>
<br>
Suggestion 3:<br>
I prefer it when it's the mage's duty to reduce resists. That creates way too much aggro and I have enough aggro as it is. Scaling the sotf up to 20 at level (50? 60?) ain't a bad idea though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Suggestion 6:<br>
The improvement in evocation spe does exist as AA. It's called spell casting mastery.<br>
<br>
Suggestion 7:<br>
Not sure about that one either. It seems to me it would only be useful to robe kill mobs as our nukes cast fast enough for snare to be enough really. Others may have a different view.<br>
<br>
That's only my view of course, but if we want VI to listen to us we have to be reasonnable.

I know little of the high end game, but on NPCs without any distinctive resistances (anyone would have to be an idiot to use ice comet instead of conflaguration on an ice giant), I always use my most manna-efficient nuke. The sad thing is that if you cannot lower that particular resistance on an NPC, then you will end up suffering. I really got into the idea fo resists after playign an enchanter solo for the first 22 levels. Her spells were rarely resisted due to the massve MR reduction provided by Tashan(i) and I miss that with my WIzard who is a far less independant class than my enchanter at those earlier levels.<br>
<br>
I'd love to see an even further increase to evocation specialisation. perhapse I was scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one, but I woudl love to see a secondary Specialisation.<br>
<br>
I'd still love to see Enahnced Root added (since we ARE the first class to get the spell) not to mention quad-kiting is a dauntign prospect which I'm not enamered in participating in (4 mobs breaking BoF at once?

<br>
Harvest does upgrade actually, fairly well.  Adding a second, identical harvest would potentially double the mana regen of the skill at the cost of another spell slot.  I'm not saying this is a bad idea, just pointing out some things you might not have thought of.<br>
<br>
Suggestion 2:<br>
<br>
I do not notice better hit rates with my Banish summoned spells, and usually I find my normal spells to be better anyway.  If I, as a magician, find my normal nukes to be preferable I doubt most wizards will ever use them, even in the extremely rare situation that they actually encounter a mob that it could be used.<br>
<br>
I think the same could be said of undeads.  The banish undead spells are great, but really only when compared to necro and cleric nukes.<br>

Sunstrike is not the most mana effecient wizard dd...  Also I think an AA abily make spells more mana effecient.<br>

<br>
In particular the suggestion to give us a debuff line seems very bad to me. The strength of the wizard class is that we are focused. Take that away and I guarantee you we will suffer.<br>
<br>
We lack hitpoints, armor, debuffs, heals, etc etc etc because that's what the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  other classes</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are for. If we needed them any less to do the things they do, then we could not justify wanting to be (and being, imho) the biggest guns on the block by such a deleriously gratifying margin.<br>
<br>
But here we go, point by point<br>
1) more harvests...<br>
I have advocated this before, but in retrospect decided against it. Sure, it would be in line with the wizard class to specialize by sacrificing more spell slots for more damage... but harvest in its current form adds mainly to long term dps, not burndown dps.<br>
<br>
Now, if you tailored a harvest for burndown situations, that would be cool. Say... 3 hour refresh 1000 mana, instant cast... more or less useless for grinding, awesome for burning down a boss mob. That would be kinda spiffy...<br>
But I think something like this already exists as a group spell for enchanters (an ancient spell). That's even better; like I say, the more we depend on other classes, the more kickass nukes we can get while remaining balanced.<br>
<br>
2) banishment lines<br>
why? if you don't like something, just blow it up.<br>
<br>
3&amp;4) debuff lines<br>
already been over this<br>
<br>
5) group spellshield<br>
eh... i guess =)<br>
<br>
6) increased specialization<br>
as others have already pointed out, this is already in the game<br>
<br>
7) improved root durability<br>
yeah this would be nice... but we don't need it, and as I've stated several times now, the more we specialize the better. Druids on the other hand <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ARE</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in need of more distinct areas of expertise, because the endgame is all about specialization and druids are sh*t outta luck as it stands now.<br>
<br>
As long as they get cool new spells that don't compete with my nukes, I'm happy... and when their cool new spells are designed to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  help me nuke</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I am VERY happy =)<br>

Your suggestion #4 would amount to a HUGE nerf to the wizard class. If you don't know why then I'm afraid you'll have to log in and ask a more experienced wizard via /tell. Discussing such matters in a public forum is never a good idea, sadly.<br>
<br>
I play on Quellious and would be happy to discuss the matter further with you. I am usually playing either Naldawen (56 wizard) or Asron (60 druid).<br>

<br>
<br>
-immediate 20% increase to DD and rain damage<br>
<br>
We're supposed to be the masters in this category, and I believe we should be so decisively. A few points difference in mana cost or damage output and a second or two difference in cast time does not a master make, heh. I'd honestly want to see more than 20%, but that would be a good start.<br>
<br>
-The Eye of Zomm line<br>
<br>
I know most folks don't really care about this sort of thing, but one of our monikers is Masters of Knowledge. The Eye of Zomm, since the &quot;nerf&quot;(heh) it's been scribed near the front of my spellbook. It's immensely useful for scouting around corners, taking screenshots, giving the layout, mobs and such for a given area to the group without risking a monk or anyone else who can agro and get squashed. I'd love to see further upgrades to it...upgrades with longer durations, faster speed, lev, better swimming skill, and so on. Not nearly as important as our other issues, but it'd be nice.<br>
<br>
-Wizard only Gear<br>
<br>
Not nearly enough class specific &quot;armor&quot; for wizards of real value. All the int classes get shafted in this manner...we all compete with each other fiercely for item drops with good mana and int...and often wind up rolling against rangers/SKs/pallies/monks because the item in question is all/all and has sta/str/dex/low weight(whatever). There needs to be more wizard only gear in the same vein as ranger only bows and SK/Pally only weapons. The only real weapon we have is our spellcraft and the only way to increase our power beyond simple levelling is gear that increases our manapool.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just my personal opinions, for what they're worth.<br>

I like the idea of gaining disciplines, to allow us to get criticals in and such.  Frankly, the melee classes can critical WELL before levels 50-60, why must we wait until we get enough AA points before we can do so? The other suggested /discs are interesting as well...<br>
<br>
Also, DO NOT fool with the Staff of Temperate Flux, at least not too much. It MUST remain an Instant-Cast item. <br>
<br>
I could see adding a MR debuff, and scaling up all three modifiers from -6 to -10....perhaps make it the result of another quest, completed at a higher level, wherein you combine the staff in a container with some quested components, and hand it to an NPC, and the reward is the new &amp; improved staff...call it the Staff of Destabilization...?<br>
If this is too powerful, make it Equipable, forcing us to give up a melee or range slot.<br>
<br>
How about a /TGT command?  /tagetgrouptranslocate, like /tgb, it would allow a wizard to translocate people/groups they aren't a member of, allowing the porter to remain in his/her current group and not disrupt things.  It would have to be Translocate spells since those have a consent box anyways, preventing mischievous porters from sending people off to exotic locales without their consent <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Spells I'd like to see <br>
<br>
- Group Invis with a built-in See invis component...lev 29?, &amp;<br>
- Group Improved Invis... lev 55<br>
- Group Levitate...level 29?<br>
- Group Spell-Shield, definitely<br>
<br>
- Sacrificial Rain - lev 60 Ancient Spell - a Continuous Rain spell that sucks 100 mana &amp; 100 hps per wave from the Wiz until he/she is dead or oom,  interrupted, or clicks the Icon off...and CANNOT cast another spell in the meanwhile, nor move.  Plus recovery time after clicking off or being interrupted, before the Wiz can cast another spell, could be high, as well, increasing the risk.  Valuable to groups hunting NPCs with gazillions of HPs, perhaps...<br>
<br>
...damage per wave per npc = 500 * (caster's level/npc's level.) / # of NPCS (max 4)<br>
<br>
Works on PCs lev 50 and above.  Imagine a wizard who has been buffed with HP increasing buffs, regen spells, and KEI, and wearing regen items, Flowing Thought gear, etc...  <br>
<br>
Not accounting for regen of HPS and Mana, a wizard who has 2500+ hps and 2500+ mana and is able to get off 25 waves, say NPC(s) is/are an even con, 25 waves *500 dmg = 12500 dmg to 1 target OR 6250 dmg to 2 targets OR 4166 dmg to 3 targets OR 3125 dmg to 4 targets, assuming not a single wave is resisted.<br>
<br>
perhaps the damage formula, costs, etc needs tweaking, I'm no expert at this..but I think from a roleplay perspective, I would picture a wizard so focused on outputting damage that they do not realize the toll in energy and vitality it is taking on them....or they deliberately exclude this from their perception, sacrificing themselves for the good of the group....<br>

<br>
Why? Because rains are about fast damage, and because they are useless in a solo situation. If verant is willing to make us stronger, but wants to keep us dependent on other classes, rains are absolutely the answer.<br>
<br>
We should definitely have a level 60 rain spell, and a level 60 ancient rain spell.<br>
<br>
Extending the number of waves seems like a fun idea, because it gives us even better damage, but requires group coordination to keep the mob in place. I don't think I particularly like the idea of a continuous-casting rain tho. Nor the idea of nukes costing hp... it doesn't seem like a bad idea, just... it represents a break from the wizard outline.<br>
<br>
I would give the level 60 rain a good solid 3-4k damage potential over 4 - 6 waves. Tears of prexus has a base ratio of 4.73:1, so I would expect the 60 rain to break 5:1. Probably 5.25:1. The ancient version could hit a nice solid 6:1 (keep in mind our ancient nuke does 4.8:1, so 6:1 on an ancient rain seems conservative if anything) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/17/02 4:40:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=659.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: some other thoughts</span><hr size=1> I personaly dont think wizards needs alot of totaly new things. Letting harvest uppgrade so its somewhat similar amount of total mana at 60 as when you get it would be nice I think. Group spell shield at 60 would be nice too. But the only thing realy left to do since test changes and focus items, are damage uppgrade. Considering the cleric nuke, I would guess general caster upgrade will be around 25%, then add focus items to that. Should be enuff to make things interesting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucynlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cynlas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/26/02 8:14:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=659.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: some other thoughts</span><hr size=1> Having just read a similar idea in a different thread that made me perk up, I thought I would pass it along.  Wizards are masters of direct damage and travel.  It seems that other classes that have specialties, i.e. poison and diseased based dots, or heavy magic based debuffs and such also have increased resistances to them.  I can only imagine that this would come from spending time experimenting in order to master the skills.<br>
<br>
My suggestions are rather simple.  We, wizards already have resistance spells that are self only.  But as I have experienced they do not stack with other such buffs.  I honestly don't see the reasoning.  We play with fire and ice and lightning as professionals, but our own defences do not work along with others.  They should stack, and I think that magic resistance should be added to one of our spells.<br>
<br>
My second suggestion is that we are also supposed to be the masters of travel.  If we can fold time and space into a neat little pocket only to open it up and be somewhere else, I would like to think that we would likewise be more resistant to being forced into another area.  A buff, and I think group buff would be not out of reason, simply because we already transport groups all over the realms, that would grant either immunity or higher resists to being summoned seems to me to be in-line with the class.  If the spell idea is too powerful then maybe a class level alternate experience skill.<br>
<br>
That's my two cents worth. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dalatha>Dalatha</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/27/02 12:03:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=659.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re: anti-summoning</span><hr size=1> anti-summoning simply won't happen. it's how verant keeps pathing problems and pulling in check. espcially with the number of new permarooted uber mobs (it would seriously be broken to cast nukes or dots on a perarooted mob without worrying about being summoned). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=659.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=659.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=659.topic&index=19><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=659.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=659.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=659.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=659.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
