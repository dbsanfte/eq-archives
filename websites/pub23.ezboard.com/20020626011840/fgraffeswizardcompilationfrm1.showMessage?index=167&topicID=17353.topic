<br>
Let me explain myself, wizards can 'buffer up' damage by medding even though there is no mob in camp, but if everyone decides to go afk for 15 minutes or so that does the wizard no good at all, as he will be FM after 4 minutes and then spend the rest of the 11 minutes afk, therefore even though a 100% uptime group for 15 minutes WITH a 15 minute afk pause might actually be a 50% uptime group, in practice it isn't, unless the wizard ahead of time knows everyone will go afk for 15 minutes and can nuke down to OOM, and even this will only reduce it mildly.  Wizards thrive on pulls then small pauses, not continuous pulls then big pauses. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uhow786.showPublicProfile?language=EN>how786</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 1:04:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17353.topic&index=170>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uptime</span><hr size=1> &quot;And remember a rat could chew through your cable wire and drop your uptime to zero.

<br>
Probably about the same odds a level 58 Wizard will have their best Focus items, wouldn't you say?<br>
<br>
Regarding Mage AA: they have neat abilities, they don't have the scale of Wizard ones but I'd say some of them are really useful.<br>
<br>
Now on to Armoks notes:<br>
<br>
&quot;- I'm going to adjust my target uptime for balance to 45% (27/60)<br>
- At that point, wizards are a little underpowered except in the 49-51 range, and at 60 with full AA<br>
- Increasing mana regen or damage output by any more isn't an option: it puts top end wizards too far ahead of everyone else (except in the highest uptime groups)<br>
- Adding right click nukes at low-mid levels continues to be the best solution. My current suggestions:<br>
1) Add a new tradable right click nuke, 120 dmg, 8 sec cast, usable at level 24<br>
2) Move Orb of torrefaction (250 dmg, 10 sec cast) to somewhere more accessible, make it tradable, usable at 46<br>
3) Give Velious Quest robes a 15 second cast time. This makes them only slightly worse than the Orb of Torrefaction (Really!)&quot;<br>
<br>
OK lets examine this.  First I'm pretty sure your uptime estimates are pretty good for average, even though almost all of us have at least on occasion had better.  Wanting a different number would take us out of the AVERAGE grouping experience, which makes the entire exercise pointless for helping Verant.  Second, as the examination is looking at the ABSOLUTE BEST POSSIBLE equipment and setting, it is not reasonable to complain that you don't have all that gear - neither does the average melee, Armok is looking at the worst case scenario in terms of melee power (incidentally I believe that this is why Verant went the path of focus items, as a comparison to melee gear).<br>
<br>
Now, here's my thoughts on what we have so far:<br>
<br>
&quot;- At that point, wizards are a little underpowered except in the 49-51 range, and at 60 with full AA&quot;<br>
<br>
As compared to Melee.  I'd say some levels we are more than a little underpowered, and many levels we are in pretty sad shape compared to other casters (a situation which focus items made actually worse, not better).<br>
<br>
&quot;-Increasing mana regen or damage output by any more isn't an option: it puts top end wizards too far ahead of everyone else (except in the highest uptime groups).&quot;<br>
<br>
Only true if there is an across-the board, total increase of power at every level, including level 60.  Your statement assumes that ALL levels and ALL spells would be made more powerful in damage, including the levels we'd all agree Wizards are in fine shape.  That's not neccessary, in other words an increase of power for some levels would help the class but would not have any damaging effect on the levels you refer to here.  To summarize: raising the power of Inferno Shock would not make a level 60 Wizard too powerful.<br>
<br>
&quot;- Adding right click nukes at low-mid levels continues to be the best solution. My current suggestions...&quot;<br>
<br>
It is a solution, but one I'd call probably the worst choice.  While items that cast spells for Wizards is not only a classic fantasy bit, but a concept I personally like, I do not trust Verant to handle them properly in terms of distribution, power, and difficulty to achieve.  Consider where the items are presently for Wizards, consider the inability to actually twink with these (the reason melee is as bad a mess it is right now).  Consider the focus items and how some of them are so poorly distributed and built (hello, items with type 2 focus effect in level 50+ areas?).  Verant has a terrible, terrible track record of appropriate risk vs reward in gear, especially something like this.<br>
<br>
Further, the item system Verant refuses to retool (hey guys - if you do the work now you can test it for EQ2!!!!) results in items that are of limited desirability and utility.  I'd rather have ten wands that did half the damage of the rend robe but cast fast and had a longer recast time than the actual robe.  The charge/recharge system is further damaged (and incidentally pretty easy to fix if they'd put some thought into it).<br>
<br>
Lastly, right click blasting items put an even greater reliance on items for Wizards to reach what they need in terms of balance versus OTHER casters - an effort and reliance that these caster need not face. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 6/11/02 1:45:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uylaine76.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ylaine76</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 1:56:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17353.topic&index=173>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uptime</span><hr size=1> As an archmage for over a year, and with epic for that long as well...I think if one is going to compare the damage output of mages, they really have to ask themselves 2 questions really<br>

Does the Magician have epic? If so then their pet damage more than doubles<br>
<br>
Do they have Shield of auras? Forget about Boots of bladecalling, a mage with shield of auras is an insane damage machine.  Im willing to bet its one of the all around better caster right clicks in the game, perhaps other casters need an item with such magnitude<br>

Anyway the wizard chart was interesting to read <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Ive come under the impression that Wizards are the masters of doing quick damage against *any* mob (Except tunare since she was forgotten in the resist change or something), but do not get high damage against a particular mob<br>
<br>
While mages are masters of sustained damage, and especially high damage against level 55 and under mobs due to pet hitting much better.. and of course if the mage has shield of auras their contribution is substaintally improved<br>
<br>
I have a lot of wizard friends and my issue with wizards is pre60.  Yes I'm not a wizard, but I think every class deserves balance <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and Im rather distressed at the 1-59 collection of wizard spells, seems odd to me that only at 60 do they recieve damaging spells (Sorta along the line with clerics who only recieve their best spells at 59-60, ignoring complete heal) While other classes, especially druids, mages and enchanters recieve their top spells much earlier and their power progression is much more steady up to 60..

Permanent focus items are especially difficult for wizards in their 50s to acquire, where they currently have to wait until they get end game items which also work at level 60 to cover their 50s.<br>
<br>
I add the following recommendation (suggested by a few others on this board already):<br>
- Change Focus I items to have the following effectiveness on spells over level 20: <br>
(effect * (50 - (spell level))/30)<br>
- Change Focus II items to have the following effectiveness on spells over level 39:<br>
(effect * (70 - (spell level))/30)<br>
<br>
This would mean when applied to draught of fire (level 51):<br>
Focus I dmg focus would increase damage by 0% (IE: would not work, as now)<br>
Focus II dmg focus would increase damage from 0-12.7%<br>
Focus III dmg focus would increase damage from 0-20%<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> To summarize: raising the power of Inferno Shock would not make a level 60 Wizard too powerful.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is true. I have avoided going down the road of independently balancing the spells at each level for the following reasons:<br>
1) The power curve was pretty carefully balanced, and tweaking one spell has implications along the entire curve. This is difficult work, and global solutions are easier. <br>
2) Leaving the spells as is and modifying power by items leaves the bare low player game (where players use level appropriate gear) intact and well balanced.<br>
However, Grim is correct: boosting the power of lower level spells (or upping mana regen) is another valid balancing tool for low level issues.<br>
<br>
Personally, I've &quot;gone over to the dark side&quot; if you will, where I now believe that a few levels of underperforming helps to justify better performance later on, following the classic model. How long that apprenticeship should be is a topic for discussion, but I would say being a bit underpowered for the first 24-30 levels is acceptable; being underpowered for the first 59 levels is not.<br>

I plan on eventually proving the reality of the situation with easy to understand graphs and such, but that's a topic for another thread. It is my hope that Verant will take this to heart and make the changes that need to be made in order to achieve balance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 3:40:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17353.topic&index=175>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grim3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Uptime</span><hr size=1> &quot;Yes, in the 1-34 range, wizards are in especially bad shape, although I'm not sure how focus items make this situation worse, unless you are talking about a Verant checklist, with a big fat &quot;done&quot; checkmark next to low level wizards because focus items (which are by no means universally owned) have been added.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well what I mean by that statement is related to caster vs caster balance, outside the scope of your work here.<br>
<br>
By adding in so MANY types of focus effects, the number of total focus items vs the number that actually are of any benefit to Wizards is fairly large.  Some classes such as Necromancers and Shamans especially are incredibly benefitted by these additions (Shamans get a benefit from every single focus item except the necro pet one, Necromancers get benefit from ALL of them, but the healing ones are of limited value to them).  So basically the list of items that are available benefits other casters more than Wizards, who are not in all that great shape vs other casters or in general before level 49.<br>
<br>
So the addition of focus items made matters worse for Wizards vs other casters, not better.<br>
<br>
I would disagree at a small point though, and that is your assumption that the low level game is balanced for Wizards when everyone is naked or has gear appropriate to their level.  This is true for melee, I've always thought Wizards stacked up very well against melee before the obscene flood of overpowered and even broken weapons and armor into the game.  But against other casters, there's still some problems, and raising the power of some spells would help that imbalance while having no real effect on melee - which is already twinked (this occurs within a few months of even a new server opening, which I find exceptionally unlikely to occur again even once from now on). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp;
