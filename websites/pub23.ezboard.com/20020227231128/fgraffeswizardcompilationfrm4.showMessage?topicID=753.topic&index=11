<br>
Naming names, I recently got screwed over on raptors by a druid on Xegony named Ksuneo.  I spent levels 43-60 in TD so a lesson I learned early is that you must, you MUST communicate in that place or people die.  And unless you have a cleric twink or you're one heck of a cyber expert it's almost impossible to get a cleric out there for a res.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I was on large raptor island, as I had been for several hours that day.  Yes, I was doing all 8.  Another wizard was doing the other 7 raptors.  Ksuneo zones in and asks me and the other wizard if we're doing raptors.  We say yes, and we all agree he can have the single spawn on the north of big island until one of us leaves.  Ksuneo communicates that to me and it's all good, right?<br>
<br>
Wrong.  Well about this time our guildleader says it's time to head to Ssra temple.  I'm bound @mons lethalis, so I figure I have another 3 quads and I'm set.  Meanwhile, without even speaking to me, Ksuneo petitions me for taking all 8 raptors.  I didn't know it yet, but I received a tell from him saying that he wanted to make arrangements for him to take half of big island or did he need to petition me.  I'm thinking WTF, he's threatening to PNP me?  So that's what I asked him, was he planning on PNPing me.  I also expressed my shock to the other wizard at what was going on, and he pointed out the guide was already in the zone.<br>
<br>
Anyhow since I wanted to keep the spawns broken properly I asked the druid to hold on a sec and rounded up the 2 vicious and 2 raptors and killed them.  I came back to the camp spot and there was the druid and the guide.  The guide said that I was taking all the raptors (I had only taken these 4 since this started) and I needed to work something out with Ksuneo in says.  Throughout this he's sending me tells about how he doesn't want to call a gm (she was already there) and just give him 4 raptors.  Well I was planning on leaving anyhow so it was no big deal besides the annoyance.  Anyhow, I say to him if he wants to talk that's fine but does he really want to be known as a PNPer by involving a GM?<br>
<br>
Well the guide put a warning on my account for threatening Ksuneo.  The punk swore he didn't ask for it to happen.  I asked the guide how I'd threatened him after about five minutes of hemming and hawwing and she said that I had threatened him by telling him he'd be known as a PNPer.  That's a threat?  It's not like I mentioned he was going to get any kind of backlash at all.  I wanted him to dismiss the GM, that's all.  Well now I had a warning on my otherwise spotless account.  I have a pretty good reputation on my server, so this annoyed the living hell out of me.  To make a long story short, I asked for the matter to be escalated, she made me repetition for that, I did, the senior guide said it wasn't a big deal to have 1 warning on an account and just don't worry about it, Ksuneo got all 8 raptors, and I got to the guild raid 45 minutes late and missed rolling for Greater Familiar.<br>
<br>
So if you're on Xegony and you see this sack of crap, ask him how he feels being a PNPer, and unnecessarily getting a warning put on someone's account.  But don't use my name or I'm bound to get another warning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR>

Apparently I didn't make enough qualifying statements in my first post to qualify as Politically Correct in today's world to some. I clearly stated that there are good druid players in the game and that it was just MY PERSONAL experience over the last 2 weeks. Since the time of my first post, I can also add 2 more incidents to the tally.<br>
<br>
It was MY PERSONAL experience. If you have had a bad personal experience with bad wizzards or bad players training you then you are free to rant about them. I do believe that there are no bad classes, just bad players. So I ranted about 2-4 bad dr00ds that have wreaked havoc in TD, so what? Just let me rant about them so I can keep my sanity.<br>
<br>
I look forward to your rant about bad players. But god forbid you mention that they were wizzards, that must mean you are an anti-wizzite. I mean, I am not anti-druish. I hang out with them all the time, we eat foraged worms, roll in the grass together, charm bears them make them do crazy stuff like farting on Holly Windstalker. I love my druid brothers and sisters. <br>
<br>
Wasn't Jesus Druish??<br>
<br>
/makes the sign of the cross for the Lord's forgiveness for the last comment<br>
<br>
Sorry there wasn't enough PC qualifying statements, but can't I rant for 5 minutes to get it off my chest? I will make a donation to the ADDL (Anit Druid Defamation League) for my sins of 1000pp.<br>
<br>
Yes bad players suck, not classes. But bad players have to choose a class and I was talking about these bad players who just happened to choose this class.<br>

It alsways amuses me that people come to a rant board with the &quot;can't we all just get along&quot; message.  <br>
<br>
I say bullshit.  Some people playing this game are real jerks or really immature kids, and many of them play druids.  Many of them started as wizards, but then quit them when they found out the class was hard (remember 2-3 years ago when Wiz = KSers?)<br>
<br>
Anyway, all I will add to this thread is if anyone thinks the druids in the stories above weren't trying to kill folks, you are kidding yourself.  They may have invented some BS story, or pleaded ignorance, but the truth is they were training to kill and eliminate competition for spawns.<br>
<br>
In particular, druids do this because they view wizards as competition and inferior competition to boot.  Why do I say this?  Because they can solo about twice as fast as us at most levels based on DOTs and the inherent efficiency of wis based casting.  <br>
<br>
So to them, not only are you (a wizard) taking their spawns, you aren't even killing fast enough to make the druid feel it's justified.  How's that for logic?  Now, before everyone goes bananas, understand that I don't think EVERY druid is a vile kiting rodent, just a good many of them are imho.  Some are truly helpful folks who just wanna play and have fun too.<br>
<br>
But my toon has been killed on purpose by PCs on four  occasions, three were out-and-out pixel murder (for certain) and once possibly by accident (but I have my suspicions).  In any event each time it was a druid.  And in one case the druid actually admitted my speed in taking down ice giants was an issue with him.  <br>
<br>
I started a druid on another server, simply becuase I wanted to get to the point where I could twink a few lowbies in a few months.  What can I say?  I ran out of slots and I like variety <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So OK I'm a much more experienced player (aren't we all) and I probably am being very efficient in selecting where and what to hunt, but OMG the class is SO easy to play.  Basically once you hit sow level, you are a soloing machine.  So I agree with the other posts which indicate that druids, along with being a neat and well balanced class, are also the class of choice for the selfish powergamer types (can you say tracking?).<br>
<br>
Yeah it's not great to generalize, but if the paws fit...<br>
