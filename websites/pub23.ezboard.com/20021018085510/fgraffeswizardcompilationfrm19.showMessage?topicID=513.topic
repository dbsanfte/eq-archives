<br>
Not to be a downer or anything, but if you are only 9th level, and already asking questions like these, and being concerned about how fast you level...the Wizard class may not be for you.<br>
<br>
We are, arguably, one of the slowest exping class out there.  That little comment about money not being a factor means nothing for leveling a Wizard.  Wizard twink stuff doesn't increase the speed in which we level like it does for melee's, and even other casters in some cases.<br>
<br>
If you are playing a Wizard because you love the class, and enjoy playing it, then by all means find out what the &quot;quickest way to level&quot; is...<br>
<br>
But, I submit to you, if you are looking for the quickest way to get Manaburn, then you need to go ahead and stop now because you are going to frustrate yourself.  <br>
<br>
Good luck to you,<br>

Levels seem to come as slowly as groups do especially for a casual player. At around level 9 i was killing stuff in sro (dervs and orce iirc) and at 16 i moved on to NK to kill beetles (learned with my bard that these things run as fast as you do, so you don't really need sow, just a head start). beetles took me to 21 or 22 and then i moved up to maru seru till 32, then off to kill drakkel wolves for a while in GD, then i started grouping in Tenebrous mountains and then into Scarlet desert at 45 or so.<br>
<br>
The wizard class imho is the best in the game (for my play style) but i get bored of nuking every once in a while and pick up my bard for a few nights.<br>
<br>
Bards are a fun and challenging class to play and can do well solo and seem to be always wanted in a group.<br>

Moreover, a wizard really doesnt come into his own until the mid to late 40s, arguably even his 50s.  Fact of the matter is, there is no easy way to level a wizzy.  All the &quot;easy&quot; ways, such as quadding, kiting, etc take a lot of time, a lot of patience, and a LOT of downtime.  Unfortunately, you really cant do those things until you get to at least 16 or so, and then they're still really hard.  I didnt master kiting until I was nearly 25, and quadding until I was nearly 40.  Now I go and do them no problem, but I still prefer the group atmosphere.<br>
<br>
If you want to level up a character fast and do incredible damage, might i suggest the way of the rogue or the warrior?  Easily twinkable, fast to level, and everyone wants one in their group.  On most blue servers, everyone looks down on the low level wizard (read everyone that is *NOT* 60), and its near impossible to get groups.  Get a good group of friends, find some spots that you like, and stick with them for a while.  The only way your going to be respected is to learn your class, and let people know that you know how to play.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of good wizards out there that better our reputation as a whole, and then there are those that keep us down in the slumps.  It takes a good wizard to level, it takes a patient wizard to level, and theres usually a good chanter behid them too =)<br>
<br>
If you really want to be a wizzy, stick it out, but dont expect things to come easy for you.  The only gear that even remotely helps wizzies level is FT gear, or items with free nukes on them, but your not going to see those for a LONG time.<br>

I too was like you. It took me awhile to get beyond that level 10 bareer (Sp?) Being a DE I ran around Nektulos, EC, WC, and NRO at level 9. That is about the fastest way I know. Groups are very hard. Sometimes you find people that don't understand what our class is truly about, and that is ashame really. Everyone I know, from my younger levels is now 34 plus. However, a friend of mine, a Wizard, says that we really don't come into our own until 29, when we get snare, and really can't solo stuff big time until 34.<br>
<br>
I'm 27 now, have been for about 2 weeks now. I once dinged into 28 and found it impossible to hold it using my old haunts. I do have a 51 SK also. The standard routes, ie OOM, LOIO, FM, OT, just don't work for me with my Wizzie. He's a lot more fragile than my SK ever was. That stated, and to reiterate what was said in past posts...Patience is vital here. Wizards do come into their own, and since my SK hit 43, he hasn't been on a raid without a couple of them coming along, much to detrement of my exp bar. LOL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Wizards are a lot of fun, indeed I enjoy playing mine more than I ever have playing my SK, short of going on raids. It will change and will get easier as you go. Just remember that the Wizard until 30 is hard pressed to stay alive. After that point, the world is yours for taking. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I almost gave up on my wizard.  I just couldn't get past level 11 for some reason.  I, actualy, stopped playing him for about a year.  Came back to him and he's now 51.<br>
<br>
Being a takes patience.  You have to want to be a wizard just to be a wizard, not to get to level 60.  I think that is what was doing me in.  I wanted level 60.  Now, hay, I'm a wizard, what more do I need?<br>

<br>
I gave him some stuff my 54 Mage doesn't need anymore and bought some cheap stuff in bazaar (all in all it did cost me some 500pp I guess...but of courser if you add the items he got from my Mage you might be at 1.5k)<br>
<br>
Untwinked my wizard had 20Hps at lvl 1...twinked some 140. also I got +160 mana from items (plus the mana that comes form +30 Int). He has also got 102 Str and quite decent AC.<br>
<br>
Do I think that will get me faster to Lvl 50 or so? No certainly not. But it helps a lot on the first 10 or so levels. I think until then I can play the warrior-style pretty well, hunting even cons and some yellows.<br>
<br>
But I don't expect an easy time afterwards ;-)<br>
Of course I want Manaburn within 2 weeks...but that shouldnt be too much of a problem ( ;-) )<br>
<br>
Nah...I hope to get him to around lvl 50 in a few months so we finally have a wizard on guild raids (for a long time I was the only Mage as well, but meanwhile we got a lot Mages so I think we might need some &quot;real&quot; Nuker...)<br>
<br>
Well...and last but not leasst...when I started to play EQ I thought for a long time Mage...Wizard...Mage...Wizard.....Mage... <br>
Ok I decided for Mage, sometimes I loved my decision, sometimes I hated it. So I just wanna have both now ;-)<br>
<br>
and no, I didn't want to go through the hell of early levels completly untwinked again. So hell yeah, I gave myself some boost and it worked out nicely so far :-)<br>
I don't want to play a melee char, but being for the first time a tank is fun ;-)  But with every level it gets harder now ;-)<br>
<br>
<br>
and why I want to play a Wizard mainly is: I wanna do some AE groups in my high levels ...sometime ;-)<br>
Mages arent really liked there so I need to get a Wizard up there somehow ;-) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170427" target="_blank">

<br>
I made my wizard for the simple fact that my guild doesn't need another warlord for tanking, but a 52+ wizard would help alot on our raids for DPS.  Plus we have the most awsome lvl 60 chanter in my guild that really knows his stuff for AE groups, and i can't wait!<br>

I also made him to group with some of our mid 30's guildies.<br>

I have been plaing for not even a month now and am halfway though level 27. I have spent the majority of my time hunting in HP and HK and am now looking for a new hunting spot. The only problem I have ever had with being a wiz is not being able to get into groups but rather actually getting ANY loot. In 11 levels I have only made 23p, 8g, 4s, and 7c, no items, and the occasional rune (if I'm lucky). The rewarding part is criting on a nuke for over 200 dmg and blam, its dead. I am on the Bertox server and for some reason the tanks here are incredibly greedy, lucky for me I found a great way to make money at level 20 or I would be totally broke. My advise is this: if your going to play a wiz try to find a regular group of people to play with so that when you are medding up you won't be getting the short end of the stick on looting. And in a few more levels soloing will be the only way to go.<br>

Patience, skill, and a little luck are the tricks to being an awesome wizard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utaarne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Taarne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/29/02 8:53:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=513.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I love my wizard</span><hr size=1> I've played three wizards in the 3-4 years I've been playing Everquest.

Soloing can make you frustrated and depressed. Avoid poor looking pickup groups, but do group once in a while, for it's so much fun be able to do massive dmg, and save the group by rooting and nuking an unwanted add in 15 seconds, while the rest of the group goes &quot;Wow!&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Twinking a wizard does not make him much faster to level, unless you can in some absurd way get ahold of lots and lots of Flowing thought gear.. What I recommend you to get is, DD and mana recuding focus items.. It lowers the downtime, and thus reduces the frustration. HP items are also good, as they will reduce the amount of deaths by _a lot_. Believe me, before lvl 29, you will die a lot if you are unsowed and/or have crappy hp. Mana won't be that big of a matter before you start quading, but it's always nice to have a good sized manapool.<br>
<br>
Leveling a wizard is soooo much easier than it used to be, provided you have a little bit of cash, or enchanter friends. You probably guessed why, it's all thanks to KEI. With it, you can gain level sooo quick, as long as you can avoid deaths.<br>

<br>
I repectfully disagree with all of you.<br>
<br>
XP is only slow in the lower levels.  Getting to 19 or so was kinda slow but not a whole lot slower then the other classes.  Getting a group as a wizzy is very hard at higher levels but at lower levels you can usually get in.  Once you hit 18 or so go to Paludal.  I was getting a full blue solo there a kill and with KEI it is very very fast xp.  You can xp there all the way till about 25.  mobs start to LB at 24.<br>
<br>
24 to 38 or so was fairly slow for me.  Spent a lot of time wandering around.  Get in a decent guild with people your  level and try to go to a few dungeons.  Sol A is pretty nice.<br>
<br>
I went from 38 to 51 in under 2 weeks so who ever thinks wizards level slow hasn't played any other classes.  I have never seen such insane xp I was getting while quading in IC and TD.  It took me a hell of a lot longer to get my monk and my cleric through these levels.  Even going from 51 to 60 as an Iksar monk was a royal pain in the butt.  Having to find a good group that would go to a dungeon and play long enough to make it worth while.  I hated those stupid encs and clerics that left 30 minutes after we finally got to chardok or HS.<br>
<br>
With KEI you can get about 3 to 4% per quad.  I am only lvl 51 now but I am certain I wasn't getting 3 to 4% per quad as fast as my monk was getting group xp.  The best thing of all is that you don't need groups.  You are always ready to solo.  Just send a tell to the many level 60 ENCs on your server that have KEI, My friends list is has quite a few, then offer 50pp and a port if they would like one for KEI.  Most ENCs have no problem casting it if you run to them.  There are many places to solo on luclin, kunark and velious some are a little tougher then others but practice makes perfect.  There is a lot of good info in these boards of places to hunt.  IMHO wizards are the fastest leveling characters.<br>

<br>
First, on grouping. <br>
<br>
My main is a wizzy and I've never had problems finding groups. Some say it is the hardest class to find groups with, but like all the others it depends on your personality. <br>
<br>
1.) You must have patience when looking for a group on any given day. Are you willing to spend the time to think of a good place to camp, and then ooc or shout for other peeps to join you? This can take up to a half hour, and no, no one will ever seek you out. Until 29+ your a wimp and everyone knows it. But you do have one advantage at 20+ - self port. You must be proactive and use it to your advantage. Shout &quot;lfg&quot; in the zone, send tells to your friends, form groups, whatever, but you must be proactive. <br>
<br>
2.) You must have patience when leveling up. If your a true noob, it will take you about 20 levels before you start playing the wiz correctly - if you ever do. It's about this time that your melee skills are out damaged about 30-1 by the tanks and you are forced to sit and nuke. 20-30, however, your nukes are still not effective enough to make you very valuable. It's about this time that most non wiz-oriented personalities, i.e. impatient people, stop playing their wiz. From my experience its about 30-35 when people will accept you as a valuable member of a group. No, they still won't seek you out, but if you ooc that your looking for group you'll be invited just as often as most other classes. That's when your crits really start getting up there, you have group evac, and, theoretically, you know how to use the wizard properly. Its my opinion that most people give you the benefit of the doubt at 30+ because you SHOULD know what your doing by then. If you didn't you'd be playing a druid, the easiest class to play in the game... <br>
<br>
3.) You must start to use the wizard properly before you can expect re-invites and smiles. There is nothing worse then over nuking as it is high profile. Suddenly all the tanks have nothing to swing at and you have a wiz standing there stupid with a mob or two pounding on them. This usually results in multiple tells from most of your group trying to explain to you how to play your class. You see, a wiz can kill most mobs in the same time it takes most tanks to bring it down to 75 percent health. Its very easy to get that itchy trigger finger and try to prove you are the best character in the game. You should not. However, depending on how much damage output your tanks deliver, and/or the healing power of your primary healer, you'll want to vary the timing of your nukes. In that way the wiz class can become interesting, and it requires a lot of groundwork and practise to get your timing down. In some cases you'll want to ride the edge and exert the maximum ammount of damage possible without drawing aggro, and occasionally you will draw the ire of a mob - just don't do it twice, or a tight ass leader may just boot ya. <br>
<br>
On the positive side, a good wizard will speed up the pull rate of a group. Before level 29 or so, most people won't openly acknowledge you, but you can silently smile to yourself when you see them type &quot;wow, we're getting experience fast.&quot; Later on, it's an ego boost when you make that 500+ crit and the average melee puts out an 80 crit. Oh, and manaburn (Wiz AA ability) is simply the most powerful weapon in the game. 15k+ in unresistable damage tends to bring down most bosses. That's when you feel your true power  And the evac spell at 18, that is the best way in the game to get people to remember who you are and re-invite you later. You'll have everyone praising you - silently and out loud. Don't evac too soon though - again, another timing issue. And finally on raids, wizards/druids are integral to getting everyone to the raid spot, and wizards alone are integral for translocating everyone away from the raid spot to the place of their choosing. That's the time when everyone lines up and pays homage to you asking for ports all at once LoL.<br>
<br>
4.) And perhaps most important for anyone who likes to group - You must have a good personality. There is nothing more annoying than being grouped with someone inconsiderate in terms of loot and demands/undeserved arguments with other group members. <br>
<br>
After that long winded explanation I move on to soloing pre level 29 wizards are the worst soloing class in the game. Post level 29 they are equal to or better than any class as soloing. See: Bonds of Force area effect snare spell. That said, most wizards tend not to be solo oriented...they'd never make it to 29...they'd be a druid  <br>
<br>
Finally, nukes fizzling. yes it happens, but a warrior sometimes misses when he/she swings. In fact, sometimes the warrior wiffs 7 or 8 times. the point: yes you do get resisted, but not too often unless your facing a much higher level mob. At that point besides ports, and until the Draught line of spells, your nukes are useless. <br>
<br>
The wizard class really is a rewarding class to play. Granted I have not made the end game yet, but from all I've heard it only becomes moe enjoyable as you get bigger. That certainly has been the case from my perspective. If I could sum up a wizard in a sentence: They are the class that can immediately change the outcome of a group situation faster than any other class out there...for better or for worse. Oh, and they are a class completely based on proper timing and feel for a situation as aforementioned. Now, feel free to be a druid if ya want..just don't take it personally when I rib ya :P <br>

If you have not been there yet, they are located at the Arena zone line so this is a relatively safe place to hunt.<br>
At around level 11 or 12 you can head to EK and kill the gnolls and undead gnolls til around 15 or so.  If you are not familiar with hunting in EK, then when you zone in from NK, head right along the coast and pull gnolls back to the beach.<br>
Both obviously require root-bombing.  If EK is a little too high for you and 11/12 then head over to NK for a level or two.  Those three zones should see you level to 16 relatively quickly.<br>
