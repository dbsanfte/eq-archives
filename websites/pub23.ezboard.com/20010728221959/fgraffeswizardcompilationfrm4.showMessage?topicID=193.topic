<br>
When most of us started playing our wizards we were assured that all the problems we were having at lower levels would have a payoff when we got high enough.  We would be able to &quot;nuke&quot; mobs and bring them down fast.  When we all hit 29 we were excited to have our first group ports.  Who doesn't remember the thrill of scribing those spells and then actually porting people to another continent.  Felt great didn't it?<br>
<br>
I remember getting to 44 and Conflagration.  My god!  I felt like the most powerful being in Norrath.  Until I cast it on a mob and was partially resisted and eventually killed.  OK, I said to myself, I get Planes Ports... then I'll be needed.  Yes I was needed to port 11 groups up to Hate and then left out of the loot pool after having spent every last dime I had on the stones for the ports.  When I did bring up the fact that I was promised gems in return for porting everyone up I received  a diamond, and some cheesy jewelry.  No more Hate for this wizzie.<br>
<br>
After taking a month off from the game I came back to Translocates to zones.  Oh yeah, that will make me more attractive to a group... oh wait, the TLs only come AFTER the raid and the tanks wanna get to auction points to sell their phat lewt.<br>
<br>
Wizards have repeatedly, and rationally explained that as the only caster class wholely dependent on mana we have no decent mana regen (Harvest?  Don't make me laugh).  We are continually and succinctly told that it will NOT happen as it would &quot;unbalance&quot; the classes?  HOW?  Explain that one to me Verant?  How would giving us a little regen boost would unbalance a class system that you already admit is already unbalanced?<br>
<br>
We don't want to be gods.  We dont even want to do ALL the damage.  All we want is to do what you said, at first, that we do best, and that's magical damage.  We want to do it well and consistently with just a wee bit less downtime.<br>
<br>
There are soooo many MR mobs in the game now.  When they make a melee resistent mob, then I'll consider the classes balanced.  We're not doing this just see our words up on the screen.  For the most part I would rather come here to get tips and give advice to young wizards.  We do this because unless we all speak with one voice and tell Verant that either they fix us or we're all outta here, they will NOT take us seriously.  These rants are for the yutzs at Verant who don't get it. <p>Severine <BR>

Guess what, this isn't the place for it. I don't read this board to see people whining, go to the rant forum.<br>

I like my wizard. Yea, that's right, I like the class. I'm a freak I know...god help me. Maybe, just maybe, if people complain to me enough it will rub off and I can ruin my EQ experience too.<br>

If you don't think wizards are useful, play another class. I'll still be here. <p><P>

<br>
Nuker who's not ashamed of the size of his/her nuke-  these are people who dislike complaints about the class, cuz it's not the size of yer nuke, it's how you use it.  i mean, come on, if the class was broken or something, they'd be aware about it.<br>
<br>
Wizard with LFG envy- not just LFG, but frustration borne of any long term effect, really...  these are the people with complaints that, valid or not, get posted often, and usually with little variation in what is said...  that's not necessarily a bad thing though, as for all the POSITIVE response these complaints have garnered (both from other wizards and verant), it would seem that perhaps repitition is called for.<br>
<br>
Taxi- meleer's alts who have been PLed to 39.<br>
<br>
Me- monkey with no smile for the pretty ladies (you ever see a spider monkey frown?  breaks yer heart, i swear)<br>
<br>
and if ye dislike being categorized like this (i like my category presonally) don't worry...   it's all just observed behaviour anyway, and my ignorant and ignoble opinion to boot...<br>
<br>
JUST LIKE ALL THE FUCKING BITCHING!<br>
<br>
which goes both ways...<br>
<br>
jesus, i've never seen folks so hellbent on not respecting other people's opinions (outside of religious fundamentalists)...<br>
<br>
and i'm not saying anybody should stop giving out opinions, but this is a forum for wizards...  i like to think of us as having to be a little bit smarter to play our characters than the other classes (least the way i play...  figuring out the aggro of missed melee hits helped a lot) and i would hope that goes along with our ability to be civil towards each other....<br>
<br>
but then again, i guess not.<br>
<br>
and so everyone knows, i admit NOW i could be wrong about all this, cause i'm a cavalier guy when it comes to things like that..  so please feel free to disagree with me (and the hypocritical way i've presnted my argument...  life's a bitch, me too, you too, whatever, i really could care less)...<br>
<br>
but if we can't find a common ground where we can freely exchange ideas, without fear of ridicule....   *shrug*<br>
<br>
screw it, i'm leading to nothing important, ignore all of this NOW<br>
<br>
EDIT- oh yeah, in our bickering, we're no different than any other class-based message board community out there.  except we have what is probably the best class site out there backing us up, which is what all this negativity ruins.  to which one might say, &quot;why the hell don't you stop reading the boards, you idiot jackass?&quot;  and to which i would respond, &quot;i'm a craven, slack-jawed, inbred mongrel of a human being who enjoys punishment.&quot;  <br>

I happen to be in a guild with 7 solid Wizards in it, and if you think our guild leader (57 Wizard btw) doesn't appreciate what 7 50+ wizard bring to a raid you're very mistaken.<br>
<br>
As for groups, I am never, ever EVER LFG. Want to know why? Because I play my class to it's 110% potential. I play smart, I look out for everyone, and I know when/where/and what to nuke and how hard to nuke it as well. <br>
<br>
Do I know my limitations? Hell yes I do, after 55 levels I think I've figured out what I can and can not do. I've learned to accept the fact that I can't unload on ever mob. I've learned to control my mana to match with the Cleric in the group. I've also learned how important it is to assist the Enchanters as well.<br>
<br>
Would I like a better mana regen? Of course!!! Would I like higher damage nukes? Who wouldn't!! Do I think the Wizard class is broken? No, and that's a HELL no. We have no more problems then anyone else does. Infact I would not want the Wizard Class to ever become popular. Who the hell would want MORE of us running around, biitching cause their nukes got resisted or their spells can't effect group members. Every wizard I've met loves it once they learn that we (just like everyone else) have limitations and some awesome strenths.<br>
<br>
In short, if you don't like the Wizard then think very HARD on why you continue to play it. Perhaps you would be happier as an Enchanter or Cleric. Maybe grap that dagger and make a rogue with it. Hell, there are plenty of classes to give a try out with. I can gaurentee then tho, when you are bored Silly you will take that Wizard back.<br>

<br>
not only that, but beyond difficulty is the idea that certain classes will intrinsically take up more time than other classes to play.  a bard will always be more involved in what a group is doing that any caster, all tanks are going to be wacthing out for their caster friends pre-35, and getting their caster friends backs post-35.<br>
<br>
here's an idea that may or may not be recieved well (prolly depends on other people's perceptions of your skills as a wizard).<br>
<br>
the reason there is so much complaining is because wizards are actually a great deal harder to play, and that leaves a lot more room to complain for players who can't measure up to the demands of being a wizard.  not to say that all the complaining stems from this (such a declaration would be absurd), but that it could account for a portion of it.<br>
<br>
and if such is what you meant, and you didn't feel like spelling it out, samadhi, then i apologize for being dense....  such is my nature. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=elrond>elrond</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/13/01 9:10:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:</span><hr size=1> okay note. <br>

*** THIS POST WAS MOVED FROM THE GENERAL FORUM TO HERE ***<br>
<br>
so no one reads this and wonders what the hell Solkan was saying when he tells the poster to post in the rant forum. Furthermore this change took place just as i was posting a reply and my long thought out reply was lost.<br>
<br>
in short: I am tired of this proud wizard mentality. This is not a static game. expecting everyone to be happy with every change the developers come up with is rediculous. Asking someone to quit whining and quit a char they have played for 50 RL days is also rediculous. i am sure there will be some future patch i am upset about and i reserve the right to &quot;bitch&quot; when it happens.<br>
<br>
Some poeple dont like having to take all the load in porting (since we are better at it then druids now) and some people didnt like new content (zones and weapons) that weakened us comparatively. They have a right to complain if they want. <br>
<br>
If anyone followed this quiting advice when clerics got nerfed there would be no clerics at all now. Instead, the clerics &quot;bitched&quot; and the heal/agro was lessened some. quit thinking you know how to play your wizard better then someone who complains when a change occurs they dont like. Somewhere down the road a change you dont like may occur and then people might tell you YOU dont know how to play your class. Get it? game NOT static. you NOT better. get off your high staffs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucovenantu.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Covenant U</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/14/01 10:55:37 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE:</span><hr size=1> /agree Elrond.<br>
<br>
And to the guy above who claims he's never lfg your ability to group is could be a function of a nice guild where people play to have fun and appreciate your company.  My bet is you are a good player but they also look to group with you cause they like you, not because you're any more group-worthy.<br>
<br>
Don't insult everyone who comes here to complain they are consistently /lfg by inferring it's because they can't play their class.   I've been solo almost all 53 levels and I think I'm a pretty damn good wizard.  I think most 50+ wiz are pretty accomplished, hell you would have quit at 35 if you weren't.  I (and many others) still can't get into groups easily.  Most of that is because people don't want a wizard in their group if they can avoid it.  <br>
<br>
I love these guys who get into a good guild and think they invented the class.   <br>
<br>
And to Solk, I don't care where this thread started it was a heartfelt and interesting post.  People like you get off on contrarianism.  You are certainly in the minority.  I think you are also full of it when you claim to be entirely happy with the class.  You want everyone to think you are really skilled or are just a more balanced person.  I suspect you are neither.  If you truly were, you wouldn't have posted, but would have skipped the post on gone on to the next thread.  <br>
