For the last couple days, I've been pulling either the northern ends of both raptor island or going around the big island and then bringing 3 or 4 raptors to the chessboard island for safe kiting.  <br>
<br>
I like to grab one and pull it out into the water to slow it down.  I then dash in and grab another until I have 3 or 4.  I then line them up while traveling over the water to the chessboard island.  I've done this about 20 times now in the last two days and no deaths.  I feel pretty good about that.  It is great exper; 54 is going to go by much faster than 53 did.<br>
<br>
Tonight, however, several people were there who got upset with what I was doing.  They began discussing camp spots and safe spots.  <br>
<br>
Well, I tried to respect their conventions, and let them know when I was pulling and where I was pulling.  However, even though I tried to be careful, the raptor that was following me in a southern direction between the islands (I was headed around big island to get a couple more), aggroed on a bard in what they later described as their safe spot (I suspect he was playing an aoe song) and killed him.  I tried to pull the raptor off the bard with a couple draughts, but didn't get it pulled off him in time (had to have been playing a song).  Although, the spent mana meant that round of quad kiting was over, I then took the raptor away and finished it so none of the others peeps would be bothered.<br>
<br>
I've read everything on quad-kiting raptors on this board now for a month or two and don't recall reading much about camps and safe spots.  I'm very frustrated at the moment because  I play the game for fun and relaxation and hate it when someone jumps all over my case.  On the other hand, I do want others to have fun too and therefore desire to learn all I can about the defined camps and safe spot conventions (if they exist in any standard form). <br>
<br>
Can someone help me out here?  Can you direct me to a post or page that discusses such conventions for the two raptor islands if they are in fact standard?  I'm happy to play by the rules.  Everyone pays their fee and should be able to have as much fun as I'm having.  No one likes a newbie who runs into a zone and overpulls; it wrecks everyone's fun.  Even though this isn't the same thing since I can handle my pulls; I still don't like being accused of training.  Never ever done it on purpose and don't want to start now.  <br>
<br>
A couple days ago, someone referenced a master guide to quad kiting raptors on this board, don't recall the site off hand, but I did go to it and read it carefully.  Many of you mid to high 50s have probably read it.  In that guide, the author refers to a safe spot on the chessboard island.  That's the only safe spot I've read about. <br>

Stay at the raptor island with him/her. Both of you can easily clear the large island (druid rings). The break may be hard, but holding it is simple. If both of you are camping all 8 spawns, no one will try to invade your camp. If someone does a camp check, just say you are camping large with your friend. That worked for me and a friend (who leveled from I think 53-59 on Raptors). If I played still I would probably be there with him now hehe. <p>Oltovillo Miniime<br>

Basically, there is one on the far side of the big island, another at the ne side of the big island, and one one sw corner of the small one. Pretty much a small cluster of them really, concentrated around the the little waterway between the 2 islands. Just avoid pulling by there after you have 3 raptors on you. If you have 3 raptors following you, the 4th one will hare off after anyone else who comes into agro range no matter what you have done to it. This is because the game will only allow 3 things to actually be attacking you at a time. You can see this happen by agroing 4 then standing still and letting them beat on you. 3 will stay with you and attack, and 1 will wander off. If you kill one of the 3 on you, it will come back. Sharing the big island is doable. Sharing the small island can be done as well (6 spawns plus one behind the big island so someone will only get 3). Best thing to do if multiple people are around is try for the small island and just kite there because it is easier to keep control of your pulls. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucrysalisthewizard.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crysalis the Wizard</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/23/01 11:25:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Raptor Conventions and Rules?</span><hr size=1> <br>
Kite ON the island with the druid ring, not sure of my TD directions, but there a small piece of sand where you can safely sit and med, pull the 2 roamers, the raptor facing the small island, and hte middle vicious, kite on one half of the island, careful not to aggro raptor spawn at druid ring, if you get a partner, he can easily do other half of whole island, then both can use whole island to kite!<br>
<br>
If you really must pull back to Chess, DO NOT EVER pull between islands, go round the long way if you have to, i trained a few people when i first started raptors too!<br>

As said above, don't EVER pull between the two small islands, as you'll prob aggro stuff.  If you are doing the smaller island, start on the big-island side, curve down and up and, once you leave the island, head straight north, don't go left at all or you may aggro people.<br>
<br>
You can still end up killing people... I've even seen some people medding, lev, north of the small island over the water.  They usually figure it out pretty quick, though, but you can piss people off who aren't aware of how dangerous raptors can be (e.g., high aggro, very fast, very deadly)<br>

Something like, waiting 4 minutes or so after they've cleared their spawns, then pull your 4 to the small island for kiting.<br>
Depending on the 4 you choose to kill on the large island, it's no hassle &quot;breaking the spawn&quot;.  You can kill 4 raptors on the big island, even with a full spawn, just a little bit more tight with kiting space, but easily doable.  Just gotta watch the pathing of the raptors on the big island for a few minutes.<br>
Also, there are no &quot;safe spots&quot; out there really.  I finally learned to just invis and med over the water out of aggro range of the raptors I killed. <p><blockquote>

<br>
The bard probably WAS playing a song, healing or mana, which was buffing the whole party which was in range of the aggro of the raptor, so he got the enmity of the raptor. He was NOT playing an AOE song, come on, you are just trying to divert blame by suggesting that.<br>
<br>
I don't know, I kite for a living and I can't remember the last time I got something on someone else. Within the first 30 seconds of being pulled the poor critter's been so fluxed that it can literally be killed without it diverting attention from me.. in fact I have used this fact frequently when partnered.<br>
<br>
Really this situation should never have happenned.<br>
<br>
I was killed myself when I was a wee lass of 19 while sitting on the rock between the islands when a druid brought a pack of raptors RIGHT over me. It was a druid so what can you expect (some of my best friends are druids.. but I wouldn't want my sister to marry one) but I think we Wizards should be, and usually are, more courteous. A death out there is a pain in the butt.<br>

Just so yas know... trying to build aggro with the Flux<br>
Staff doesn't work very well any longer.  They nerfed it<br>
when they changed the aggro amounts of debuff spells... ie.<br>
Enchanter Tashan line, Shaman/Mage Malo line.<br>
<br>
While you can still pull with it... trying to transfer aggro<br>
back to yourself with it is pretty difficult.  In a pinch,<br>
a nuke will do much better now.<br>

There's typically enough to support 3 sets of quad kiting and here's how it's usually broken down:<br>
<br>
1st person on the scene gets the north side of the small island and either the roamer that comes to the north side of the small island or the solo raptor on the small north beach.  I prefer to pull to the chessboard island myself as I find it easier to group them up nicely while they're in the water, but I know a number of people who kill them on the smaller island.<br>
<br>
2nd person will usually will pull the two statics and two roamers from the east half of the big island and either kite on that half of the island or pull to the chessboard island (and yes, this is thru that middle water passage).  If the 1st person is not pulling the north beach raptor, it's common to pull the two roamers, one static and the north beach and get all 'raptors' with no Vicious.<br>
<br>
If there's a third person, it's common for the 2nd and 3rd person to split the big island.<br>
<br>
&quot;Safe spots&quot; are generally considered to be near the big Iksar statue on top of the small island and on top of the mountain tip near the chessboard overlooking the southeast beach.  The little outcropping to the east of flats of the big island is also considered safe.<br>
<br>
The BIGGEST piece of ettiqute involved in kiting raptors is making sure that EVERYONE knows what you're up to if they're in the area.  Ask every person who might possibly be killing raptors if they're doing raptors, which ones they're pulling, where they're killing them, etc.<br>
<br>
I've only been quad kiting when I can't get a group or a raid for the last couple levels so I've probably only got about 100 pulls under my belt, but I've rarely had problems and have never gotten anyone but myself killed.. =)<br>

Depending on the situation if you need to nuke or just flux. But if you flux spam on the pull it's not going to care about anyone but you not matter what, unless you get out of it's awareness range.<br>
<br>
Although I can see that if a body thought he was alone, he may not want to do all that clicking if he didn't think it was needed.<br>

 Also you really don't want to kite to chessboard, it wastes a lot of time, just kite on the island you are on, if on small go in on the south beach and pull the romaer, 2 raptors and the vicious, then kite them on the southern part of small, rinse, repeat.<br>
 If you get large you will need to watch the pathing a bit first while invis, there are 2 roamers but they both pop on the eastern side of large, so if you are alone there jut make sure you get those when you pull, they are on a 12 minute respawn so that gives you time to med up and get them when they pop before they start to wander off, blast them down and make sure not to get too close to the &quot;druid circle&quot; coz there is a raptor standing in it, when you are done, cast harvest when harvest repops they are just about to spawn <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I and nearly everyone I've seen quad kiting raptors on the Rathe uses the small outcropping of sand on the large island that Tegellan spoke of as a safe spot.  As long as I've done raptors, I've seen four clear spots to camp.  The big island has 8 raptor spawns on the druid ring beach.  There are two camp spots here, &quot;big front&quot; and &quot;big back&quot;.  The front camp is the two wanderers along with the VR near the ocean and the raptor closest to the safe spot.  If you wait for the wanderers to come to the front you can round them up quite easily.  The four in the back can be taken very easily when front is cleared.  There are two camps on the small island.  As mentioned before, small front (or back, there's no real ruling on this because the other spawn doesn't use a front/back term) consists of pulling the wanderer, the vicious raptor, and the two statics on the south side.  These can be quadded very easily on the island.  The last spawn that I know of and observe when quadding raptors is the &quot;tri spawn&quot;.  This consists of the two raptors on small near the hut on the North side, along with the single raptor spawn on large.  This is only three raptors, but if everything else is camped it's something to do.  Start by pulling the single off large, then grab the two by hut and quad them.  These are the conventions I've used my entire time quadding raptors.  They work pretty well until people who don't know what they're doing show up and ruin the party for everyone.    <p><CENTER>

Give them a tell, ask them what's up, whether they know all about raptors, agro range etc.  If they are there by accident, you probably just saved someone's life.  If they are curious about raptors, and there are some available for learning, then do your best to educate them about the dangers -- in addition to saving them the aggravation of an untimely death, you could also save yourself and other fellow raptor hunters.  When they do their first couple pulls, have them give you a tell beforehand and invis yourself.  This has saved me on more than one occasion.<br>
<br>
Finally, if they are belligerent about it, just make sure you invis when they pull (or when medding if you are paranoid), and the problem will usually solve itself.  I've made many friends kiting raptors -- there's lots of time between pulls to talk to people...<br>
