<br>
Now if they decided to nerf twinkings effect on pvp that would be good but not likely.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me clarify that for you.  I would love it if they nerfed how much twinking effects pvp but if they can't do that its not an overall issue for the class involved.  In other words.  Your class isn't bad because <br>
<br>
A) You can't fight uber twinks effectively, if you could you would be unbalanced vs non twinks<br>
<br>
B) You can't gain godly power via twinkage<br>
<br>
If pvp twinkage is a negative thing we gain nothing by making it worse. K?<br>
<br>
How to REALLY adress twinkages effect on pvp.<br>
<br>
Cap resists based on lvl.<br>
Give all weapons a recommended lvl.<br>
Give all haste items a recommended lvl.<br>
Give all regen items a recommended lvl.<br>
Make jboots/tboots/sow potions only work after 30.<br>
Make sure all focus items have a recommended lvl. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ullyapakadeabn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llyap aka Deabn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/23/02 12:17:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Your response Aerimus</span><hr size=1> Just begs the question, did you even read my post? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=maegnarloth>Maegnarloth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/23/02 9:30:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> LET ME CLARIFY... again</span><hr size=1> I'd have to ask the same thing, Llyap.<br>
<br>
I'm not complaining that a twink is making my class or their class unbalanced.  I'm saying that even if I WANTED to twink, there is no gear out there that will give me the same power to make melees so powerless, as the gear that is available to them.<br>
<br>
One more time:<br>
<br>
If you want to resist my attacks, you need high resist gear.<br>
<br>
If I want to resist melee attacks, there is no gear available to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not ranting against twinking, I'm ranting against gear balance.  There is NOTHING I can twink with to cut melee damage the way anyone can cut my damage.<br>
<br>
-------------------------<br>
Furthermore<br>
<br>
I don't really every expect there to be any gear out there that &quot;resists&quot; physical attacks.  Sure, it might balance the twinking on the pvp servers, but that's not where Verant and Sony make there money.  Gear that would &quot;resist&quot; physical attacks would make the PvE game just silly.  Mind you, if they could ever make server specific gear, or gear/spells that only work on PC's, it would be a dream come true.  Of course, that would be too much effort vs. reward (where have we heard that before).  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=maegnarloth>Maegnarloth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/23/02 9:35:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> And another thing!</span><hr size=1> All of this aside, I'm glad many classes see us as easy meat.

The problem is gear related.... A level 20 (insert ANY class) wearing full set of BD jewelery, diamond rings, jboots, or any level 50 gear like this, can flat out resist my Wizard spell damage to nothing. <br>
<br>
What's that you say? If they make gear level dependant than I will get snared/rooted/whatever? Great! I accept that, because that means YOU can now be rooted/snared/whatever. Warriors, Rangers, Rogues, Monks who all complain that they need the MR gear to prevent a root spell, learn to use a friggin bow or throwing weapon. If you say that won't work, it works most of the time. No I can't do anything about you getting rooted, wizard ran over hill/around tree/behind wall and is target nuking you. Carry pumice next time. My level 35 Warrior with an archery skill of 157 can hit you for 15-45 pts a shot, enought to interrupt a few times till I get rid of root/snare. I am not using an uber bow either (Forlorn Bow from warrens, attainable at level 15+ with group, 20+ solo almost). I took time to get my fletching up so I could make those dmg 5 arrows.<br>
<br>
So I am all for making gear level based, even if it costs me an item or two (not that I have anything beyond my level anyways as a wizard). I will gladly accept a higher percentage of snares and roots landing on me, IF it means I have a chance of doing it to you now.<br>
<br>
You can't win all situtations all the time, as a nuking class, surprise is my ally (should be everyone's). But the plain facts are it is hard to cast my 5.7 sec nuke while taking damage (it doesn't take much most of the time). Melee's learn to use throwing/ranged weapons more, take the time and effort to do it. It won't make you win everytime but it can change the tide of battle more than you think with average gear vs a caster. <br>
<br>
On a side note, I think that melee's should spawn with less than half Hit Points to prevent THEM from bind rushing, since us casters spawn OOM and can take up to 15 minutes to regain all our mana at level 45. Or maybe everyone suffers REZ type effects after spawning. Nothing sucks more than a bind rushing Melee, you run outta mana too fast and since they have no down time you can't regen mana.<br>

<br>
As far as rooting/snare/blind/stun.  Let me be clear about this as a high lvl pvper you need to resist this stuff 100% to have a chance not only in 1 on 1 pvp but even more so in conflicts involving multiple parties. Aside from group on group fights living through gang bang attempts is a neccesity for pvp players. Root/snare remove your ability to escape though a few classes may be able to ss and yonder most of us aren't so blessed and even if you do have that skill you may well find yourself dead if you look like one of the victims in a bad horror flick running away in slo mo.  Especially if that stun or low lvl knockback spell you should have resisted interupts your gate. Got it?  Blind is worse it removes your ability to react intelligently at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Why do naked caster pks get pwned in real fights at high lvls?  Because they don't resist shit.  Pure and simple.<br>
<br>
For us melees it is even worse.  You can still cast while blind/rooted/snared.  We get to stand there looking stupid while you wreck us if we are dumb enough to walk around without resist gear.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;learn to use a friggin bow or throwing weapon&quot;.  These will NOT interupt a high lvl caster signifigantly if at all.  As a pure melee any disabling spell = pwnage for the caster.  By the time you get it off (you can damn well forget pumicing anything with a melee, hybrid, or pet hitting you) you will allready be dead or as good as toast and running like hell for the nearest zone.  If you knew anything about high lvl pvp you would know that.<br>
<br>
<br>
Btw I agree melees should have something to prevent bind rushing.  Actually I think once pvp killed you should be unable to log onto that char for at least 5-10 minutes.<br>
<br>
This would be a great thing for group battles in that once you nailed someone it would take them out of the fight for at least a bit and give the victorious group the advantage it deserves.<br>
<br>
As a last fun exampe of how retarded that idea actually is say  you have a rogue fighting a chanter.<br>

Nothing should be resisted 100% of the time unless immune. Period. Deal with it. Root/Snare happens, because it works, it should be outlawed? I think not, much like hitting me with a weighted axe and harm touching me (read instant death). It happens, I deal with it. As far as the proposed escape methods...

Hmmm.. High level arrows plus high level bow equals 35-40 base damage. Now lets throw in a haste item (no high level goes without). Oh wait! Lets not forget that haste quiver (again easily attainable). Scenario time: oh look, I start cast spell of (insert favorite DD spell name), 1 sec uh oh he sees me, 2 seconds.. He fires first arrow, KER-THUNK (must be my uber caster AC) hmmm well that was only 80+ damage.. come on channel skill!.. 3 sec... still praying for channel.... 4 seconds KER-THUNK (gosh must be a sharpshooter, cause I am wearing this nifty nightgown of AC)... oh look, another 80+ damage... 5 seconds.... did channel work? maybe, if so yea I did X amount of damage, if not i wasted 6 seconds of my life to do squat, some mana, now he is on top of me beating the snot outta me... Oh joy kick stuns above level 51.... Did I kill him in one spell? Even if I hit for max damage, melee fighter still up, easily has half life left. If I run and he has a bow skill, I get shot in back (remember AC drops from behind.. oh yeah, i forgot that your bow is useless according to you, too bad shoulda learned to use it. God forbid he have an actual good bow and the above scenario results in 4 attacks during my one cast. Above example is with a 50+ speed bow with 15-20 damage crafted bow, insert one of the better Magic bows and see the damage really take off (read damage bow 30-40 or better plus dmg 10 arrows, nets you a 50 dmg weapon).<br>

One other thing you constantly neglect is a wizard is only effective if he has all his mana and is prepared to do PvP. Can't do squat without mana. Melees are good to go with HP only and minumal prep time. Wizards are great one shot items, back to back fights are very hard to pull off.<br>

We have a reasonable solution to nerf low lvls with high resists...and then we have a suggestion to nerf all resists (/rude).  Sort of like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer.  We then have the typical anti melee bs in response to ridiculing this rather useless idea.<br>
<br>
First off the first part of the post was directed at this comment by shortie<br>
<br>
&quot; I say keep the 66% nerf, Without it, other wizards will be able to one-shot you. Although, i propose making resist gear less useful. Howbout a 66% nerf on resist gear? 9 MR/CR/HR becomes a 6 MR/CR/FR =) Make melee's feel our pain.&quot;<br>
<br>
I should have made that clear.<br>
<br>
I did feel the need to respond to the idea that its ok if they nerf resists to the point where high lvl resists wont protect you from root/snare/blind because melees can always pumice if off or use a range weapon.  Which seemed to be a post in support of the earlier poster.  Which is ridiculous.  I don't care how well it works for your most likely rather twinked lvl 35 warrior.  As a lvl 55+ its bs pure at simple k?  A 60 has 0 trouble channeling through 3 hits and 0 trouble killing a rooted melee.<br>
<br>
It should be pretty clear that lvl limits on items something I've been in agreement with before and still am now will in no way effect the high end game.  This or a soft cap on resists would make uber twinking less effective for pvp.<br>
<br>
A little fyi for you snare/root/blind IS 100% resisted by serious pvpers allready.  Only bluebies and naked cowards are subject to rooting/snaring/blinding at high lvl.  This is how it is, how its gonna stay most likely, and how it should be.  <br>
<br>
Nerfing resists would in my opinion be disasterous.  A number of things to consider here. Lvls 1-50 melees without twinkage for one. <br>
<br>
Next The lvl of mr after the allready buffed up tash, bard mr debuffs,  mala, or malo hit ya.<br>
<br>
The problem is that lowering resists often doesn't have a measured decrease over time as far as pvp strength.  Its more like a threshhold effect.  At a certain lvl of mr a melee becomes a joke. Get it?   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=maegnarloth>Maegnarloth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/02 10:25:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=76>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Don't &quot;nerf&quot; resists</span><hr size=1> I would agree with Aerimus (omg, did I just say that?) in that resists should not be nerfed.<br>
<br>
What I'm talking about isn't nerfing things.  My problem lies in the attainable gear that anyone can get to resist my, and every other wizards, only means of attack.<br>
<br>
I believe that resists, as they stand, are just fine.<br>
<br>
If someone has put in the time/plat to get their resists up through twinked gear, that great!  They deserve it!  I don't have a problem with twinking.<br>
<br>
But here's my point:<br>
<br>
Mr. Melee thinks &quot;I need to get some resist gear to cut down on those ganking caster fookers.  Hey, I have a jeweler friend.  Maybe we can cut a deal!&quot;  or &quot;Hey, I've got a high level character, I'll get some phat lewtz with good resist stats!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mr. Wizard thinks &quot;Man, I just drained my manabar on that warrior with a 2 level difference than me, and he's only at 50percent health.  I better get some gear to help get his resists down.  Hey, I can get a staff of temperate flux that will cut his FR and CR by 6! ...... I'm screwed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nothing needs to be &quot;nerfed&quot; here.  I just believe that to make PvP balanced, there needs to be gear available that can nullify or at least counteract all the resist gear available.  The flux staff is great, but if it could be changed so that debuff was 1 resist point for each of your lvl's, that would be a little more effective but not stupid imbalancing.  So at worst, a lvl 60 wizard could cut cold/fire resist by 60.  Mr. Rogue's 120 resists go down to 60.  MR stays up high, so he can still run around (or away), but drafts might actually land for something and the wizard might actually be able to do some damage without making the rogue helpless.<br>
<br>
Also, the Flux Staff doesn't stack with the malise line, so don't panic about your resists going into the negative.<br>
<br>
This may solve the problem of PvE unbalance with items that strip resists.<br>
<br>
I'm not asking for uber wizard helping changes, here.  Tell me if I'm asking too much.<br>
<br>

My uber twinked warrior?</span><hr size=1> Hmmm here is my (as you put it uber twinked warrior):<br>
<br>
Armor is a blend of BA and Lightcrawler armor. Got that by soloing it all but a few parts of BA armor- all attainable at level 30 or sooner with a good group.<br>
<br>
My weapons are Scimitar of Ethereal energy (yes I bought it with my cash earned from this warrior) and a BA Longsword for Duel weild. For 2 hander I have a Mithral Staff.<br>
<br>
For ranged weapons I have a Forlorn bow (laughable at best).<br>
<br>
Ooops, I forgot to mention my Dwarven Ringmail Tunic for resists (again laughable)<br>
<br>
I have only 2 things on my person that I bought and might be beyond my level. The Scimitar of Ethereal Energy, and 2 MR rings I paid a jeweler to make.<br>
<br>
My &quot;uber&quot; MR of 88 with ALL my &quot;PvP&quot; gear is the best resist I have. <br>
<br>
With this in mind I base my above recomendations on my personal experience. I have died to a caster twice in PvP. And yes I ran sometimes, I know when I am outclassed. Here is another tidbit on how your Bow skill works for you.<br>
<br>
In Neth Lair I was at half life, got jumped by 3 darkies (iksar). A shaman, SK, and unsure of last class. I ran the entire length of Neth lair with 2 of them trailing me and I was snared. By the time I made it near the Nexus zone I was below 2 bubs of life. I proceeded to fight at zoneline but after trying to joust (which I am not that good at), I gave up and started firing bow shots off. After several 40 point hits with my good arrows. One ran off. He wasnt that wounded but guess figured I was too much effort. His buddy stayed a bit and kept Doting me. When I zoned with less than 100 hp, we chatted. He found archery very frustrating, especially when I landed a few crippling blows with arrows. Yes they were smoking me, but guess what? I was level 35 at time, they were 39 and 40, and against one I held my ground by running around and firing bow way better than I could have used melee (sk had a fungi and hit for 90-100 damage, unsure of rest of gear.. too busy running). So maybe, just maybe archery IS usefull. Shaman said I interrupted him 50% of the time.. Not bad for a useless bow (I tried to melee him, but between his gear and level diff, couldn't hit him 25% time). I do not know if bow uses different attack table to figure hits, but i hit 80%-90% of the time, go figure...(yes my str is higher than my dex&lt; so that was not reason, and skills in weapons maxed vs skill in archery at 130ish at time)<br>
<br>
But I strayed from original question....<br>
<br>
should wiz damage remain nerfed? YES (problem is gear related with low level twinks, not to be fixed by adding more gear)<br>
<br>
Sould manaburn be nerfed? NO (yes it is a one shot kill to casters, but so is Ice Comet when you get it at level 49. Remember if manaburn doesnt kill you, wizard is screwed... No mana, not even enough for gate.. And being as that damage is somewhat random, it is not guaranteed to one shot kill ALL the time those who have not the hit points of a warrior.)<br>
<br>
Now for a slightly different topic of comparing damage, ever been hit with Splurt? Pretty much instant kill if you don't get rid of it... Yet I don't see a lot of complaints against it.. (I feel that the spell is fine... in fact my only real complaint is the twink gear on low level characters)<br>
