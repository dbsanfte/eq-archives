It is quite a lonely place,now,which wasn't normal. I was with my travelling party. Ariana Blaze, who's a Wood-Elf Druid, her bestfriend Mulidin Songbird who's a Half-Elf Bard, Gaelan De'neveroix who's a High-Elf Cleric, the drunken Gnome Rogue Snivelroar Veist, and the love on my life,Zharden Soulblade who's a Barbarian Warrior. I, Keiarra Quellion, am a Erudite Wizard.<br>   Ariana was running forward with all her might twords her tree top city as the rest of us was struggling to keep up with her. But for some reason, I was sensing something was wrong. <br>   &quot;Where is everyone?&quot; Ariana asked.<br>  &quot;Faydark is always bustling around these parts....no matter what time it is. Now theres....nobody.&quot; Mulidin said as he walked up by Ariana.<br>   We were underneath the wooden platforms of the city trying to get to a lift that was opperating. <br>   &quot;Keiarra??Are you bleeding?&quot; Zharden said as he whipped foreign blood off my forehead.<br>   &quot;That's not mine.&quot;<br>   &quot;Then who's is it?&quot;<br>   &quot;I think it belongs to whoevers arm dangling is down from that platform.&quot;  Snivelroar pointed up tword it....but there was more than one.<br>   Ariana began to panic, she ran to each lift, trying to find one that worked. When she finally found one, we all boarded and were about to see the most horrific sight yet in our lives.<br>   I readied a spell just in case something of evil was up there waiting. Somethings terribly wrong, I can feel it. Each second we go up the feeling gets stronger.<br>   We we're no more that 4 feet from being level to the first platform when blood started spilling onto the lift. We all now began to panic.<br>   Our eyes grew wide in horror when we fell even with the platform. Bodies.....everywhere. Hundreds upon thousands of bodies that were now horribly deformed.Some were decapitated, others were just torn limb from limb all together.There were even some unfortunate few who looked like they were eaten then spit back out. <br>   Gaelan, Ariana, and I ran about seeing if we can restore any of the bodies while Snivelroar, Mulidin, and Zharden looked through to see if there were any who survived this masacre. But Everything was dead.<br>   Ariana and Snivelroar looked at each other and whispered the word &quot;Sophia...&quot; in which they ran to the Heartwood Tavern....or the remains of it, to see if their Halfling friend was alive.<br>   &quot;Who would do this?Why?&quot; Gaelan said as he ran about looking for survivers.<br>   I knelt down to the platform before the body of a little High-Elven girl. The look on her face made me burst down into tears. She looked so frightend with her cold eyes wide open. Blood was streaked across her. Looking twords the right, I saw dead High-Elven woman, whom I presumed to be the girls other, reaching her arm out twords the little girl. But failed to pull her close to save her. <br>   Zharden picked me up of the wood and hugged me close as we walked to the remains of the tavern to see if there were any survivers there.<br>   We peered in to look for Ariana and Snivelroar, who were kneeling over a body on the ground. We assumed that the person was dead.<br>   &quot;De'Neveroix! Help us heal her!Sophia's alive!&quot; Ariana screamed at Gaelan while bind wounding the halfling.<br>   Mulidin came bursting into the ruins in tears screaming for Ariana. Ariana handed the halfing over to Gaelan and ran to Mulidin.<br>    &quot;Ari......your parents Ari.....they're dead! They were alive when I found them....but no more....said Orcs came with Divinn, Mistmoore, and.....a...nother....dark elven man she didn't....kn....ow.....&quot; Mulidin cried as held on to Ariana with all his might.<br>    Ariana turned from him and ran up the blood platforms. I followed closely behind. Her home was completely unharmed, even though the inhabitants were.<br>    She fell to the floor by her parents and cried. She tried bind wounding them, but it was too late. They were gone.<br>   I knelt down and picked her up and hugged her. Both of us were now in tears again. The other members of our group followed us to Ariana's family's cabin. Zharden was carrying the wounded Halfling.<br>   Gaelan looked at Ariana's parents to see if there were signs of life. But there wasn't. He then pushed me away from Ari, and hugged her tight as ever. Those two hated each other with a passion, but now, that stage was put to an end.<br>   I looked around the room for a momnt or two, in which I found a note writen in the Dark Tongue. Luckily, I was able to translate. My eyes grew cold as anger flushed through my veins.<br>   &quot;They just wanted Ariana......but they killed everyone because of her absence....&quot;I whispered.<br>   Ariana looked up at me with her red swollen eyes and softly said, &quot;they killed these innocent souls because of me??What do I have that is of great value to them?Why me?!?!?&quot;<br>   Gaelan kept whispering into her ear that it wasn't really her fault, but that just angered her more. She pushed Gaelan away from her violently and ran. She wanted to get away from this nightmare. We stood there for a moment untill we walked out to follow her.<br>   This once bustling city was now a ghost town. For once I looked back upon its horror. I knew this day would be etched in my mind forever...a never ending nightmare.<br>   We searched for Ariana for days, seeing how Greater Faydark was a very big place.But finally, we found her near the abandoned Druid Ring. She was still crying and looking at the blood that stained her hand.<br>   She looked right at me and said &quot;They died because of me............because of me they died.&quot;<br>   I ran to her and hugged her. <br>    &quot;No my child, it was not your fault. You couldn't have known Ari.&quot; I said trying to comfort her. But I knew it wasn't helping.<br>    We camped there that night. Almost none of us spoke. We wanted to, but we refraind ourselves from it. Ariana sat away from us by her pet pegasus Sabine. She just needed to be alone.<br>   While everyone was in mid slumber, I was reading a book Al'Kabor had given me about the Profecy of Tunare. Normally I'd be researching more Wizard spells, but this other book interested me more. It seemed to me the Profecy of Tunare seemed to match mine and my traveling parties situations rather well. The drawing of the symbol of Tunare even matched Ariana's necklace. But I could be mistaken, I don't follow the ways of her goddess Tunare, but Quellious. I will write Al'Kabor about this in the morning. Hopefully, he can shed some light on why these evils are after us, especially after Ariana. <br>     The next morning we rose early so I could port us all to Nektulos Forest where Gaelan and ours guild 'Major' was to meet for a raid on Neriak. Ariana, luckily, was ready to go. She drew out a scimitar I've never seen her with before, because she alwaysed used her morning star. <br>    &quot;What is that and where did you find it?&quot; I asked Ariana.<br>    &quot;It's my mothers Naturewalkers Scimitar. I wasn't about to let someone not of family to steal it.&quot;<br>    I nodded my head and went back to researching my last spell until my spell book would be complete. But finally, it was time to gate.<br>  Everyone stood around me as I started my gate spell. I turned twords Ariana and saw tears well up in her eyes again. They we were on our way to our raid. Hopefully, we find more about this unknown man whom took part in the Kelethin masacre. <br>                     --Neriak Raid and the Unknown man--<br>                                (Will be posted at later date)<br>   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showPrevMessage?topicID=23.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showNextMessage?topicID=23.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.emailToFriend?topicID=23.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.threadControl?topicID=23.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=23.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm30">Veeshan's Peak Key<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm31">Fusibility Research<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Luclin Spell Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Luclin Faction Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Luclin Quest Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Luclin Item Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm39">MOB Resistance Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37>Wizard Tales and Chronicles</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
