Because their right&quot;--<br>
<br>
I don't dispute numbers because anyone can pull any number out of their arse and make it apply to a given circumstance. Some say MB does X amount, others say Y. Some say BS does X, others say Y. Your numbers are fine, because they are mostly unimportant untill you put them into a scenario. Which for you is always unbuffed, oblivious rogue, who is dumb enough to stand there and take it rather than play cat and mouse like a good rogue does vs. a fully prepared wizard with uber gear, full mana (cause all wizards are at full mana ALL the time... not). Now if we are going to make it a full comparisn (i.e. throw in Rogue's AA skills at same level), your comment's about BS having to be behind is null and void now. Chaotic Backstab AA ability lets you stab from any side. Now combine that with Duelist ability. Hmmm, any side, quad base weapon damage, backstabs. Now throw in the haste gear, attack someone and tell me after you get the jump on them the first volley of attacks (like how your wiz vs. rogue is when &quot;sneaky&quot; wizard jumps, the poor defensless rogue... role reversal time... Oblivious wizard vs &quot;sneaky&quot; rogue now). Ohyes, I can see my Damage shield getting blown off in one hit and taking damage. If you cant get 2 hits to land on a surprised as hell wizard (who is wondering WTF just happened)., you deserve to die. NO WAY CAN THE WIZARD SURVIVE THIS TYPE OF ONSLAUGHT. Wow! I have maybe, at best half life after one sucessful attack. And you have 14 seconds of discpline left if I am not mistaken. Combined with your chaotic stab you should have time for it to refresh at least once, if not 2 or 3 times with proper haste... Wow, if you get 2 or 3 hits in right away, wiz is dead. Much faster than the 6 sec &quot;instant death&quot; (as you call it) MB. Yes, you might miss enough to let that wizard slip away. Chances are the same that MB won't kill you either. Now I have to wait 2 hours and 24 minutes for it to refresh. You on the other hand wait 30 minutes (29 at level 60), find another wiz (or torment the one that got away) and try again... and again... and again... and yet again before MB is back. Yep, fair and square there. See, I don't have to dipute numbers or anything. You take very limited circumstances (wiz full mana, buffed to the gills with every buff under the moon of Norrath), so I will rebut with an equally innane circumstance of everyone does everything their class can do while enemy stands with a thumb up their bum (crying &quot;poor me! your overpowered cause your not a sure kill for me anymore! No fair! Too much challenge! Your risky to attack now!&quot;).<br>
<br>
<br>
--&quot;So you suggestion is its ok to make a class so powerful in pvp that no solo player has much of a chance? Because people can group lol? Your advice being either hide among friends or run in fear pffff or wait C, hope mr MB wizzie has more important people to fry than me. Nice choice.&quot;--<br>
<br>
See above rebutal and statements for most of this stupid statement. Any griefer that wants to ruin other peoples day, will, it happens (with many different classes at many different levels). Get over it. To be honest, if I go against someone who IS level 60, and has gathered enough xp to level from 51 to level 51 six times at least (5 for MB, and 1 for mental clarity requirement to get MB), and I haven't, I expect them to be superior in raw power (not neccessarily player skill, as that is different). Level 60 anyone vs level 52 anyone, level 60 should win 99% of time unless OOM, low on hp's...... So not unbalancing by that much.<br>
<br>
--&quot;Would you be ok with a skill that allowed rogues to do a 6k backstab that never missed? No matter how few had the skill would this strike you as bs? I think so.&quot;--<br>
<br>
<br>
Hmm disc of deadeye. Every attack hits if I understand it correctly (I could be wrong but I am willing to be corrected and admit I don't know EXACTLY how this disc works. Unlike you who have HEARD how all wizzy spells and fights are. If not still hit with every attack, with haste and low delay weapons, no channel for wizzy, wizzy have no life left)<br>
<br>
--&quot;The skill isn't balanced in pvp, verant admits that. Even a MB wizard thinks its overpowered. Not hearsay. Not people worried about their gear getting ganked but a player who has everything to gain from MB staying how it is in pvp. What's that tell you?&quot;--<br>
<br>
So all i have to do is find one person who thinks an ability is overpowered to justify everything I say... Easy enough. Level 60 Harmtouch vs level 52 wizard... death. gear lost (on gear loot server).. same thing happened, only much faster. level 60 rogue vs level 52 wiz, same effect... Circumstance is everything, quit whining, go to blue server if it worries you so much and you are having nightmares about it...<br>
<br>
--&quot;It's ridiculous and needs nerfing, period. However much it may look to you like a magic solution to all your current pvp woes (though ya know 60 wizards don't seem that weak to me but whatever)&quot;--<br>
<br>
Umm, yes.. level 60 rogues are weak. See first response at begining and above response. Yep all level 60's are weak. At least compare the same level to same level with same gear and same amount of disc and/or AA points. Really alters the facts a bit. More AA, means more powerful character. Period. With ALL classes.<br>
<br>
As for your pathetic response to splurt. Just as it can be dis-spelled to live through it, you can be buffed to live though manaburn. Except wizard has NO MANA (i.e. No gate, shadow-step, spells, DD's, Lure's) and has to resort to running (taken care of by dispelling sow, or having AA run skill) or combat (Hahahahahahahahahha! Yea, right.. miss. miss. miss. miss. You strike for 5 pts. miss. miss. miss. miss......).<br>
<br>
<br>
--&quot;Enjoy using it to gank 32k mobs.&quot;--<br>
<br>
And all the agro that comes with it against my mana-less self. Ok, You are right, not a single drawback to this tactict.<br>

<br>
From what I understand...<br>
<br>
Peacebreaker (high end guild on RZ) wizards mb does around 4k in pvp.<br>
<br>
Ascending dawn (highest end guild on RZ) wizards do around 6k in pvp.<br>
<br>
Individual people can of course be somewhat different than that.<br>
<br>
Next to refute your info about chaotic stab.  It lets you do a minimum bs from the front with no chance of double.  Minimum bs at 59 is 89.  It goes up to 120 at 60.  Not much of a pvp skill unless your oponent is backed into a corner. I'd rather not  waste a bs attempt. In fact vs casters a rogue doesn't get that much out of maxing their aa.<br>
<br>
They get to apply poisons faster though still not fast enough to do in the middle of a fight.<br>
<br>
They get to do a 120 (single not double) bs from the front.<br>
<br>
They get a small percentage more dmg via crits and slightly higher duel wield skill via aa. (should be between 5 and 10% and I'd bet more toward 5 personally)<br>
<br>
They get 10% more hp.<br>
<br>
They get to insta cure themselves once every 72 minutes (uber)<br>
<br>
Thats it.  Wizards on the other hand get a player DT and 2 get out of jail free cards that lets them gate off in 1/10th of a second.  Bet you can cast THAT faster than duelist kills and if you buy both of the insta gates you can do it just as often too.  Free loot and the ability to almost instantly run when things don't go your way. Among other things, fun...for you.<br>
<br>
Next deadeye is what rogues get at 54 and its far inferior to duelist.  Basicly you get 15 seconds of 1 and 1/2 x normal dmg.  It's awesome vs a snared person btw <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  But its useless unless your oponent is poisoned or is inclined to stand still and try to channel while you disc them (dumbasses in other words).  Completely. I never waste it on someone who is trying to kite. It does no dmg to speak of.<br>
<br>
Next how did I contradict myself by stating that one MB wizard had the opinion that MB was overpowered in pvp?  From personal experience.  I don't recall saying ANYTHING to the contrary.<br>
<br>
Next there is one hell of a lot of diffrence between needing to either mem a mid lvl dispell or keep a stock of pumice stones and needing full raid buffs to have a chance k?  Its ridiculous to claim someone is balanced because they can get a buff.  Might as well say nerf all melee dmg because the melees will be balanced with shissar. Please.<br>
<br>
In addition to that I never have 4k even WITH full raid buffs.  Let alone 6k.  So it remains an insta kill.<br>
<br>
As far as MB being nothing in a real pvp situation why don't you ask a MB wizzie if its nothing.  Maybe ask the PB wizzie who has I hear allready looted 3 dragon haste cloaks.  Then again maybe shes just that good.  Then again maybe not.<br>
<br>
Fact is no matter how well you play 60 people do get off 6 second spells.  I've seen wizards channel through a hell of a lot especially with skin up especially when the spell in question is classified as a lvl 1 spell as mb is.  Ever noticed its easier to get off a lower lvl spell?  Ever notice how much you channel gate(5 seconds) when a bash doesn't interupt, for example?  Oh but wait casting haste items going in.  MB will then be faster than current gate AND lower lvl.<br>
<br>
Fact is MB is horribly unbalanced and while finding joe blow to say its so the fact that verant says so means a tiny bit more.  It makes a 60 wizard into a pvp god whenever its up.  <br>
<br>
It goes beyond the normal realm of overpowering to let a single aa skill give a wizard a lure that is 6-8x as good as any before it without even taking into acount focus items.  Then to whine but but we're so downtrodden we NEED this. Ridiculous.  None of the bs you've spouted means much of anything.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself what kind of derision would the idea of pvp mannaburn have met with if suggested by a player.<br>
<br>
You would hear rational arguements about why thats too much and what really needs to be done instead.  If it didn't exist allready nobody would have entertained the idea that something this ridiculous would ever go in.<br>
<br>
Consider it that way and try to see it with the open mind you WOULD have had.<br>
<br>
Now we get hoards of low 50s wizards who find themselves worse off than pvp than once they were.  Getting the snot beat out of them by uber 60 melees.  They know nothing about melees or the limitations of same but they know that soandso with a primal smoked their ass in no time.  MB is the carrot dangled in front of their noses. Look! Here is the answer to all your problems!  Its a long road but after you get their you'll never have to feel inferior to an uber dope ever again cause you know with one tap of a button they can be dead at your feet!.  Fun? Yes.  Balanced? No.<br>

Yes, it came from the ass. Manaburn deals random damage. You are using the max damage. That would be comparative to a rogue on duelist quading and double backstabbing for maximum damage. Wich deals maybe 3k damage. Ouch, 1k less then manaburn?<br>

Chaotic stabs are also not capable of being doubled.  Hardly fatal there.<br>
<br>
I think the general feeling on RZ (as in 99.9% of the population) is that MB is way out of balance.  This is obviously a view shared with verant as per certain statements on castersrealm by a verant employee. &quot;...totally broken in pvp.&quot;  &quot;...slipped through the cracks&quot;  The first is hearsay but accurate.  The second is fact.<br>
<br>
As far as the dmg done by mannaburn.  Give me a formula and a dmg distribution as I have with duelist attacks.<br>
<br>
I'd welcome the info.  I am of the opinion however that it will almost always be a death touch even at the low end.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming since its a lure and clasified as a lvl 1 spell that partial resists aren't an issue except in freak cases.  So what your talking about is your manna x a random factor possibly reduced by the pvp dmg modifier possibly not.  I have a feeling that it will be fatal in most cases. <br>
<br>
Its not that difficult a case as there must be lots of mannaburners spread out over all the servers even if they are rare on any given server.<br>
<br>
All we need is a number of pve samples to determine both the range of the random factor and the distribution.<br>
<br>
Then we need to for a few pvp samples at least.  The purpose of which is to determine if it is indeed pvp reduced.  The easy way to do this is to look for a single MB hit that is too big for a pvp reduction to be in place.  For example if the random factor maxes out at 2.0 in pve(as determined above). A single case in which a wiz with 3000 manna MBed a player for 6k non crit would prove no pvp reduction existed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukainite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kainite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/8/02 7:29:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Gosh, this is fun..</span><hr size=1> --&quot;Next there is one hell of a lot of diffrence between needing to either mem a mid lvl dispell or keep a stock of pumice stones and needing full raid buffs to have a chance k?

<br>
I didn't claim someone &quot;needs&quot; to be buffed to balance. Merely made a braod statement that most, if not all 52+ characters, have a buff or 2 up at all times. Friends, allies, guildmates.... whatever. I presented my damage based arguement using YOUR own rules, but reversed who sat and did nothing, while being oblivious to what walked up, and failed to react to what was happening. I included AA skills that required the same amount of AA points or less than MB. Sitting with back to wall generally doesn't work well vs protection from BS. It is also impractical most of the time (unless I use the sit/stand bug to em-bed myself in wall, but that is a bug and exploit, therefor not usuable).<br>
<br>
--&quot;Next deadeye is what rogues get at 54 and its far inferior to duelist. Basicly you get 15 seconds of 1 and 1/2 x normal dmg. It's awesome vs a snared person btw  .

I never waste it on someone who is trying to kite. It does no dmg to speak of.&quot;--<br>
<br>
So you can use this against that 6 sec MB (or DT, as you call it). Gosh.... your right you are defenseless. Wait till i am 2 secs into casting and unload this disc. I don't know about you, but geting hit with 100+ damage per sec (easily done with duel wield and decent 50+ weapons and haster gear to get delay down to max of 10, I believe that is the number cap imposed by verant irregardless of percent haste cap) means I will live really long trying to cast, let alone use my channel skill. While we are on channel, yes, sometimes i take 300+ and still channel, but other times I take 30 and get disrupted. Here's a hint, use fast hitting weapons, rather than one big hit. Each hit causes some knockback effect. More hits equal more knockback, hence more disruption. Part of the reason wiz duels can channel through the massive damage is because of the afor mentioned statement.<br>
<br>
--&quot;Fact is MB is horribly unbalanced and while finding joe blow to say its so the fact that verant says so means a tiny bit more. It makes a 60 wizard into a pvp god whenever its up.&quot;--<br>
<br>
So if I find Joe Blow and he thinks rogue is overpowered my complaint becomes justified...? PvP god indeed.. Anytime you are forced to flee or worry, you cry foul. Nevermind the cost or consequences. And if you get a rep as a MB wizzy, guess who becomes the most hunted being who becomes KOS to everyone? MB wizzy vs hunting squad of 3+ members... ah yes I will use my mythical channeling abilities. There are consequences to all actions... MB has the highest.<br>
<br>
--&quot;As far as MB being nothing in a real pvp situation why don't you ask a MB wizzie if its nothing. Maybe ask the PB wizzie who has I hear allready looted 3 dragon haste cloaks. Then again maybe shes just that good. Then again maybe not.&quot;--<br>
<br>
And this one time, at band camp.... Please name exact cloak and exactly how it was done. I know very few mobs that I can find with less than 6k HP that drop a cloak with haste. If over 6k HP, then MB wasn't how she did it. And if it is a Dragon... well, need I say more about MB on that.....<br>
<br>
<br>
--&quot;You would hear rational arguements about why thats too much and what really needs to be done instead. If it didn't exist allready nobody would have entertained the idea that something this ridiculous would ever go in.<br>
<br>
Consider it that way and try to see it with the open mind you WOULD have had.&quot;--<br>
<br>
I do, hence in my examples, BOTH sides get use the same AA skill points. As for lower level getting smoked by higher level. It's called higher level for a reason.. (i.e. level 55 anyclass vs 60 anyclass.. I expect to get smoked. Leve 55 anyclass vs Level 60 class with AA skills maxed, I expected to get smoked in a spectacular fashion)<br>
<br>
On a side note again... hehe.. I dare you to dispell a splurt by yourself before it kills you as a Int caster. Isn't splurt a poison based spell? It also has like 10 poison counters before it is dispelled.... Wizzy's? please include how many times you have dispelled splurt before dying on your future posts out of curiousity... Yes, this has nothing to do with MB in your opinion, thats not the point, hence the &quot;on a side note&quot;...<br>
