I have often thought about their system and actually like it fairly well.  Let me try to summarize my understanding of it.  <br>
<br>
In general, no one rolls on an item.  The raid leader selects the recipient of a drop based on (1) Need for the Item (by class) and (2) Merit based on Attendance.  The raid leader keeps track of how many times a certain individual has attended this raid.  Whoever has need and has been there most often gets the item.  In the event that multiple players have need and have participated equally, these players roll.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Veteran Status&quot; is conferred to certain individuals.  My understanding is that if you need 2 items or fewer (say BP and leggings), you are considered to have &quot;veteran status&quot; and you will automatically get any BP's or Legs that drop. In the event that there are multiple &quot;veterans&quot;, these individuals roll for the item.  <br>
<br>
This system is clearly need based, so it should fit in well with our guilds' looting philosophies.  The difference is that luck of the draw is minimized and past contribution to (SGA) raids is recognized.  A further the benefit of this system is that it encourages attendance at our events.  <br>
<br>
A disadvantage to this system is that it places newcomers at a (comparative) disadvantage by limiting the number of pieces they are eligible to roll for.  If we find that we frequently need to enlist the help of a few individuals from outside the SGA for our raids (like Florie at yesterday's hate raid), it may be more difficult to attract them if we use this kind of system.  <br>
<br>
Well, let me close by saying that i am not the architect of the system and if certain details are not stated exactly as they are applied, then i would not be surprised.  However, the above system does make a lot of sense to me in addressing this issue.  <br>

<br>
I actually liked Heaven and Earth's loot system more, the raid leader (typically Evildoer, the GL) decided on who received any armor that dropped.  He would send a tell to each person that could use, find out what they were currently using, then make a judgement call on who needed the item the most.  No rolls were ever done, his decision was final, and there was no further discussion on the subject (i.e. no bitching and sending tells to the raid leader).<br>
<br>
There is a difference at high levels with gear even if it is just a few AC or stats better.  And most of the plane armor has resists that are needed eventually.  But honestly, I don't think SGA people really need to be concerned with minor improvements in AC or resists (we aren't taking Trak down next week, sorry to tell ya).<br>
<br>
All you really need to do is see a couple examples to get an idea on how messed up the current loot rules are.  First example: the first mob killed in Hate on an SGA raid is a cleric of inny that drops the cleric bp.  Should I really be competing with a level 46 cleric on a roll for it?  Especially if that cleric doesn't have any other EM armor, and I have absolutely no use for anything but the bp and legs.  Coupled with the fact that most likely, 5 more pieces of EM armor I don't need will prolly drop (if we clear most of Hate that is).  Second example:  I attend four Hate raids, staying the complete duration of each with no bp drops, the next Hate raid, a lvl 54 cleric in SGA attends for the first time, comes in late, stays a couple hours, and a bp drops.  Should I have to compete with them on a roll for it?  Seems to me the current loot rules would have a roll done in both cases.  If this is truly the case, what is SGA about other than putting together &quot;pickup&quot; raids.  And furthermore, what would be my incentive to join a &quot;pickup&quot; raid for Fear considering I already have the Girdle of the Diligent (the only cleric item that drops there).<br>
<br>
I was under the impression that SGA was about uniting the guilds and bettering each one by creating the ability to do plane and dragon raids without outside help.  Why use a loot rule system designed for a raid comprised of outsiders if that isn't what SGA truly is or wants to be? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umenniantheelder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mennian The Elder</A> at: 5/7/01 9:05:25 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvainne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/8/01 8:31:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http--braggarts.shareplay.com-pics-Wythe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Loot Rules</span><hr size=1> I have nothing but the utmost respect for all of you, and for that matter for the guildleaders of the guilds that use the merit system.<br>
<br>
I attend ToN raids sometimes, and I suspect I will never, under their system, receive a piece of armour. That is ok. I just like their members.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, if I wanted to be in a guild that was raid and armour and item focused to the extent that the larger guilds on the server are...well...I'd be in one.<br>
<br>
If we were one guild, and not--um 4 now? 5?--the merit system, the vet system might work. As it is, there are too many parties involved...we are many and that is our strength--that is also our weakness.<br>
<br>
The crises in the merit system comes down to this: you are rewarding people for playing alot, and penalizing those that don't. To an extent the high level game does this a fair amount itself...it is the nature of it, that for us to go to Hate someone needs to spend 20+ hours running the show, for us to continue to do high level raids, we have to have that level of dedication...that sucks, but one of the reasons we exist (I thought) was to share that burden, alleiviate it a bit by expanding the responsibilities, by sharing them with each other.<br>
<br>
We have a very high calibar of players, morals-wise. We have a decent amount of &quot;need before greed&quot; peer pressure that also reminds us at all times to put the good of the many before the one. I think that is enough. I think formal rules will cloud this issue enitrely. I think they will be abused.<br>
<br>
I dont see a practical way to apply the merit system in this case. I think the judgement calls are too complicated, and there are too many parties involved for there not to be misunderstandings.<br>
<br>
I realize that it would be galling to lose the last piece of planar you need to a random person that just joined the raid...but...PLEASE...I thought we weren't about loot.<br>
<br>
If our current policy is too much like pick up groups--hm...I'll cut to the chase:<br>
<br>
I am just saying two things here: one--I dont beleive merit will work in multi guild organization. And two: if this is why Hareq is leaving the SGA--and Amnesty--am sorta pissed--at both him and the rest of you.<br>
