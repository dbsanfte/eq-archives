I have to agree with Coren on the topic of the Lure spells not being given pre50.  It isnt needed and really isnt very mana efficient at all for those levels.<br>
<br>
On that note, I hope the rest of the wizard class tuning isnt a bunch of level 39 spells.  Don't get me wrong, Im glad harvest was added but jeezus, that was after I had already hit 50 and suffered without it forever.   The same for consussion.  There needs to be lower level tuning, but everyone will apreciate tweaks on the high end more in the long run.<br>
<br>
I don't really get the people saying Wizards are useless, and I hope we don't deteriorate all these threads to that.  Post 50 I think we do start to see improvements.  Just go out to Timm Deep and watch the wizzies quad kite raptors for hours on end and you will see what I mean.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, wizzies are one of the *MOST* needed classes for the uber mobs.  Try taking down Trak, Serv, Talon or Gore without any wizards.<br>
<br>
True, we may not have the most efficient, fastest casting DD's that we prolly should - but at least we can hit the Dragons and uber mobs =)<br>
<br>
Just go read all the whining and complaing by necros, droods and others that can't even touch the big mobs.   We need to choose our battles carefully here - lets try to get a concensus on what is the most broken and work back from there.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvalgavgaav.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valgav Gaav</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forum Apprentice</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>1/5/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>10:20:14 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">OK</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">My comment, is as its been said before. We are not a utility class like druid or shamans, we are a master of one thing (ok two, but is sight really a master of importantce?) And we do not, no matter what lvl you are excel above and beyond other classes. Ok so we have AE's, specific groups must be used, tactics and other assorted factors play a vital role when this is used, you cant just walk up to someone, hey lets ae..you'll die and so will the other. Im not going to get into an argument over cast times, down times, ect. they are all irelivant, what is relevant is our dmg and dmg potential. Right now we are on par with other classes. Is par good enuff? Considering we are the only int class with out a pet (of worth), among the other multiple downsides, why is it we are &quot; satisfied&quot; with being best, but only marginaly. There should be any thought or hesitation, we need to do damage, and we should do it better then anyone, hands down. <br>
<br>
I think the problem is, verant cant nerf us like other classes.. ok will go in to more detail.. Can they take hp? Well yes then can, but no one would play the class, we have little hp as is, equip not withstanding. Ac? dont have much in those regards either, therefor it to cant really be taken away. What can they take from us to offset the amount of Damage we should do? Thats the problem i think, but id be willing to bet no one up in that corpriate office will admit it. They have to have a pro/con reasoning for balance, but if a class has little, if you take that, it has nothing, so how do you better a class that cant be balanced by what their methods are... simply put, you cant. (not sure if that sounds right but its a generalzation)<br>
<br>
As for the spell lure spell lines, i have the new velious drop lure for lvl 44. And to be honest it has more uses then i first though. I normaly cast it first, just for the fact i hate watching a mob totaly resist my first spell. And yes even at that lvl mobs love to resist. NPC's of various types, guards (non newbie area), Sea furys and the like. All love to resist, and being  that our mana has to count it has earned a place in my 8 slots.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
All in all, id like to simply see our damage grow, nothing else, we are a speciatly class.. prove it and make us what we are supposed to be. master of damage <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> </font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#33333><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=coren>Coren</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forum Apprentice</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>1/5/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>10:31:57 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: OK</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Full agreement Valgav, the only problem, and I think in that huge ramble I failed to really say this, for Verant to make any sweeping changes to really increase our ability to deal damage to a degree where it's signficant, would pretty much destroy the balance of the game in it's present state in so many ways.  Therefore, what I've sort of been trying to do, is suggest ways that damage could be increased, ways our overall effectiveness in doing damage could be increased, without hurting game balance.  There's several specific issues which I think could be fixed easily, which I've touched on, and Grimstaff has explained in some detail.  What I'm concerned about though is the &quot;Big Picture&quot;  ie. Where does a wizard fit in with all these shifts in the game, and where should we fit?  If you just simply increase our damage to make us versatile for Velious boss mobs, suddenly anything in Kunark becomes child's play (a group of wizards dumping lures into Trakanon is very much a fearsome thing already).  Verant has to keep that in mind when they consider any possible wizard enhancements.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#000000><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forum Channeler</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>1/5/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>10:39:33 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: OK</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Regarding Lure Spells for lower levels: Gullerback is lower than level 50, as is the EXG in Solusek.  Further, there are some monsters who just have high resistances, and a Lure might be handy then.  The fact is, even if they weren't as useful as they are post 50, it makes sense to have them earlier (just like it does draught spells) just from a concept point.<br>
<br>
But they made a mistake.  By giving a Lure spell below level 50, they blew a hole in thier &quot;post 50 is not more powerful spells, it is just more control and more excellence for the class&quot; argument.  I think Lure should start fairly high (level 39 is fine, then a cold one at 44, and a magic one at 49) but Draught type spells should start at level 20.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#33333><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=coren>Coren</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forum Apprentice</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>1/5/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>10:57:11 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: OK</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Yeah I can see where lures pre-50 would be nice, I have no disagreements with ya there really, I guess my opinion is just that the impact lures would have pre-50 would be minor enough that it's not a necessity compared to other things that wizards *need*.  I do admit, my posts and opinions deal for the greatest part with the high level game, and it's not because of being high level, it's simply that I think for the large part, wizards don't really need much work until the upper levels.  Maybe something I should have brought up, one of the major setbacks for us, is mob hp scales exponentially the higher their level, where as wizard damage scales more linearly (relatively speaking) so in the high level game, mobs just &quot;outgrow&quot; what wizards were designed for, especially in single group settings.  Meanwhile, the cleric Complete Heal effectively scales up as much as necessary (I hope people can see the 'analogy') <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We are all really disgruntled because we sit on are butts constantly medding and thinking about what the other classes are doing to the mob. Watching the hitpoints, looking for the next opportunity to land another nuke.<br>
Just to have it totally resisted and taunt as if it had hit for full, now we wait a few seconds for the agro to build on the mob, and we sit back down on are butts and med some more. Next opportunity comes to nuke, we hit for full, and watch the hit points fade on the mob, just alittle bit and then some more and take a short stop, not entirely sure if all that damage was us or the 3 tanks hacking away on the mob. So we sit some more to get that mana back as soon as possible, then all a sudden you see the mobs hit points go from 25 health to Full hit points, and notice down in the water a few feet from your camp another mob swim by and completely heal your target. Then you take another look at your mana bar and are disgusted. While Jober the mages friendly pet mindlessly continues its routine of stunning, or rooting and double attacking for 50 points.<br>

First off,they have haste items why not mana reduction items!?! be able to camp like 5 - 10% mana reduct items (which will make us a lot better off) and then have some Uber Items drop off really tough drops (like 15 - 25%).<br>
          I can see about limiting the wizards nukes so they dont KS and all but what about some little buffs like a Double damage buff and 1 - 10 or 1 - 15 nukes do double dmg,would be exactly like the Ranger Self Proc buffs except it would help us do extra dmg with less mana. Or hell what about a buff (like mark of karn type) on your opponent that Will Dmg it for casting a spell,which imo would be great since it would hit boss mobs everytime they AOE'd and be able to make you effective against strong caster mobs,since we all know caster NPC's prefer to punch you for as much as your warrior Can Swing as burn there mana to nuke you.<br>
      Heh just Rambling About some idea's and have one more, Maybe Giving Tanks a Proc that made them proc something like 'enticement of flame' and be group only and only last while your in the group would make them Want Wizzies in groups again. Plus not only will we not mind while Tanks get uber powerful in melee but we will also be just as Able in dmg as the nukes that come off there swords would be from us =).<br>
    Oh Well just some ideas from a Sick_Lil_Wizard who cant fall asleep.<br>
<br>
<br>
      -P.S. Coren i respect your idea's and the Way you placed them immensly,Also the Fact your on my server makes me respect you even more because if i dont like your opinion will be a *Lot* Easier to discuss it with you so can convince you your wrong or in the uber rare circumstance im wrong (Never Gonna happen,hehe). Your Welcome to shoot me a tell anytime in game,always love to discuss my opinions and to here about new idea's for the wizard class (though the 100mana 1000dmg 1.0 casting time w/concussion effect nuke i heard someone mention made me laugh at how pissed every class but us would be,heh atleast i got a good laugh out of that idea as would all of VI).<br>

I think a lot of wizards tend to overlook how useful they can be via their root line of spells.  Granted, this has absolutely nothing to do with our main purpose, Direct Damage, but in many cases, Verant has degraded our position to just that of a crowd control PC.  I see a lot of wizards complaining that they are not group-friendly, yet fail to realize that by rooting mobs, they prevent enchanters and clerics from dying (among other things).  This line of spells is more group friendly than evacuate, imho, and can make or break a wizard in a group situation.  It may have no use in high-end encounters (ie, dragons), but I see many wizards complain about their lack of group-friendliness only because they focus on their DD output.<br>
<br>
I am not saying wizards don't need work on their DD capabilities (the removal of the 32k cap in SoV really hurt wizards)...I am only trying to point out the fact that wizards can be group friendly if they actually try.  Wizards aren't a one-sided class and shouldn't be treated as one.<br>
