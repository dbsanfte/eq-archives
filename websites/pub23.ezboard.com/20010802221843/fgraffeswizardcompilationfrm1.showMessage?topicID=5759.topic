<br>
I love Everquest. When I was 14 or 15 I discovered fantasy through books like the Hobbit and the Trilogy. I discovered it through games like Dungeons and Dragons. I discovered that I loved the world of Dwarves and Elves, Dragons and Wizards. While crammed into a friends bedroom with 5 others, rolling funky dice and imagining doing something amazing like casting a spell I would visualize how incredible it would be to actually stand with my friends and confront a dragon or discover an amazing treasure. In Everquest I have done just that. I faced the Dragon Fear, I faced the breath weapons, I watched comrades fall to their death and I watched those of us that survived kill the beast and reap the rewards. Thank you for that Verant. <br>
<br>
I remember getting this game and standing in awe outside the gate of West Freeport watching people running to and fro. I remember the first time I saw the stone bridge in the Karanas, or the windmills in Steamfront, I remember the first time I laid eyes on Felewith and Kaladim and remember how incredible it was to explore this world and to see so many wonderous things. Thank You Verant. <br>
<br>
I remember someone telling me that the griffon over there, something that until now I had only seen in pictures or in my own mind, would not attack me if I did not attack it. I remember standing amazed as I watched it fly towards me and not believing that we had reached a point in gaming that I could actually watch a griffon fly over me. I remember it attacking me and killing me in .00001 seconds. Thank you Verant. <br>
<br>
It saddens me to see so many people talk about balance, nerfs, epics, censorships and so on and so on and so on. I am just amazed that I can actually cast a fireball at a skeleton. I am just as amazed by it now as I was 2 years ago when I started playing the game. <br>
<br>
I have 2500 hundred hours of my life wrapped up in this character. I have leveled 4-5 times in a week (post 40's) and I have spent 3 months at one level (30th). Both situations were acceptable because I was able to play, I was able to cast, I was able to be an actual wizard. I wish people would quit posting about everything that this game doesn't have and look and appreciate at all that it does. I don't know how anyone can not be just as amazed as I am. As I said I have 2500 hours in on this toon. No video game EVER has grabbed that much of my attention, or been that big of a part of my life. Not to date myself to much but I remember the day Pac Man came out in the arcades so I can say I have seen a lot of games through the years. <br>
<br>
Speaking of being part of my life. My first day playing the game I met Tracy and Dan, these are their real names not their toons. Why is that signifigant? Because I have seen them through their dating, wedding, pregnancy and childbirth. These are REAL people that have had a profound impact on my REAL LIFE because I was fortunate enough to meet them playing this &quot;game&quot;. Tracy has seen me through several dating woes and I was ecstatic to finally tell her I had found the one. I have met hundreds of people that have made me laugh, pissed me off, shown me meanings of words like honor, friendship, loyalty, and generosity. My life has been enriched because of these people and this interaction. Thank you Verant. <br>
<br>
I was impressed when I saw Freeport 2 years ago, I was impressed when I saw ToV last week. Take time to step back and really think about this game and what you have gotten out of it. I know some people are negative by nature, they cannot see the good in anything no matter what. I cannot relate, I try to see good in everything. Coincidently I am constantly told what a happy person I seem to be. I only get one life, why wouldn't I try to be happy? Hmmm maybe it isn't coincidence. <br>
<br>
If you are still reading at this point I am truly amazed. <br>
<br>
To Graffe: You have given me a place to meet people that share 2 of my obsessions, Everquest and Wizards. I have found this to be one of the most enjoyable places on the internet to visit. Not EQ sites, not gaming sites, the who friggin net. Your site has stood out as a place of debate, thought, comraderie, laughter and friendship. Thank you for all that you and your moderators do. I know you must have a tough job to maintain something so spectacular as a &quot;hobby&quot; I hope that knowing how much it means to some of us out here makes it worth it. <br>
<br>
To the people that hate EQ: <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://verbalsabre.50megs.com/images/fingersmiley5.gif"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
To the rest of you: This is one mans ramblings, respond or don't. Flame or applaud. Think or don't. I just wanted to stand and speak, I think my 5 minutes is up. <br>
<br>
Remember when the K3\/\/l d00D5 tell you &quot;Ju Su&gt;&lt;oR&quot; tell them what I always say. &quot;I like bunnies, do you?&quot;<br>

But you nicely encapsulate my feelings. There are things I'd like to see changed (REALLY don't get the punishing nature of the Brainbite quest, for instance), but over all, I'm pretty happy with things. I'm not ECSTATIC, but that's OK, too, since otherwise I wouldn't go to work and I'd be fired. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxotttheevoker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xott the Evoker</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/26/01 5:33:45 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Me and my soapbox.</span><hr size=1> Wow...  well said mate...  <br>

One thing I have realized is that it really just depends on the person. You grew up D&amp;D, I did not, so casting a fireball does not amaze me in the least. Does that mean anything? No. I like to use the analogy that because of the way people go through their life they see things in a different light than everyone else. The analogy I use is that it is like looking at the stars from different planets. Not all planets have the same atmosphere so the sky is different from each planet. Each planet evolves (nobody start a creation vs evolution argument please...) ...anyways, each planet evolves differently than another. Some become polluted with volcanoes, some ice themselves over, etc. People are the same way, the grow up differently and therefore have a different place in the universe and see things differently than the planet next to them. This is why I get pissed when others knock someone else, just because they have a different view point ...because it really isn't their fault. Anyways, I digress...<br>
<br>
<br>
With that said, I do remember standing in Norrath for the first time and being amazed. I remember upgrading my computer so that not everything was in black box (old comp had crappy video card) and being even more overwelmed.<br>
<br>
I like exploring. Some people see that the best result is to obtain level 60 and get the best items in the game. The only reason I see to obtain level 60 would be to see parts of the game I would not of seen otherwise.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not always optimistic, nor am I always pesimestic. I am almost always in the middle.<br>
<br>
I think EQ is a pretty good game. Sometimes I wish I  had not of played it because it has been a big time consumer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have to admit, sometimes I just log on just to talk with the friends I have made and end up not getting anything accomplished in real life or in EQ. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Do I think it is one of the best games ever made? Nope. I would have to think real hard to put in Top 20, but like I said... I think it is good game.<br>
<br>
<br>
Exploring new areas always fills me with awe. Sometimes you sit and wish you could delete memories so you could feel that awe again ...then you think that you wouldn't do that for anything in the world. I have laughed many 'o times because of this game ...ok well, because of the acquaintences I have made in this game. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#E8D09F" size="2">You do not know me, but allow me to inform you of my code...<br>

<br>
It's good to read something like that.  I feel sometimes I lose track of what the game is like.  With all the politics and group hunting and dying in game and people telling me wizards suck, I sometimes forget the good stuff.<br>
<br>
I remember the first wizard I made a High elf.  I walked out side into the Greater Faydark forest turned around and was in aww at the front of the town with the towers and all.  Even more so though I remember my first journey to Crush Bone.  It was at night.  I remember cresting the hill and dipping down into the vally.  As I was doing so I saw the hill side in front of me going up to a big hole in the side of the hills, with orcs standing gaurd, and the large fires burning.  That and so many other things.  <br>
<br>
It's kind of sad how other things about the game, the meckanics of it, the trying to find groups, the class prejidice, the nerfing and other things have realy taken away the magic of the game for me.  <br>
<br>
Hopefully when the role play server comes out I'll be happier.  Roleplaying with others is one of the reasons I bought this game.  Sence most people don't role play, the thought of roleplaying went out the window for me.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uquuasi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quuasi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/26/01 11:17:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Me and my soapbox.</span><hr size=1> 3 months at one level? try 7 months at 55 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><table width="180" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0>

 I grew up like you with pen and paper roleplaying, and playing this game has brought the world alive to me, sure the world has its flaws but overall this is a great game and by far the computer game I have played the longest so far <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Great post and I too still feel the same way I did when my level 1 dwarf jump rolled off the big hill in front of Kaladim and died from the fall.  &quot;WTF&quot; I thought, my character rolled himself to death?  I still get those warm fuzzys even now from when say, a fetching Othmir Maiden lets me look at the special place under her tail!!!!   Ahh what a wonderful game!!!<br>

<br>
<br>
When i see post like your's it brings me back to the days when i was in Beta and played a Wood elf ranger and spent my time in Faydark trying to understand what was going on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ....i remember the times when there were no signs on 90% of the buildings in Kelethin...no bank sign, no vendors sign..a few of the guilds had signs but that was all and it was great just learning what was in the city let alone what lay beyound the tress and the forest and it was nice when someone would walk up to me and ask if i could help them find the bank,i would take them to the main lift and show them how to find it when they needed to come back later, it made me feel good to help others..it still does(and no i don't mean them pesky beggers :P ) and i never turn down a /tell asking for advice or some info on where to find something no matter how busy i am.<br>
<br>
We players make up Everquest, the game is just a way for us to interact with one another and i think thats one of the main reasons that we keep coming back because we enjoy one another no matter how annoying some of the people out there can be we still enjoy the interaction with others from all over the world and Everquest gives us that chance to meet others like ourselves and hopefully make some firends..much like Graffs boards here, we may all have a different opinion on some things but we enjoy that, we enjoy agreeing and disagreeing with each other or sharing ideas and thoughts..thats why i find it sad that some have missed what the game was really made for and that was to bring others together and to meet new people in a world they enjoy but to each his/her own i guess <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Sorry for rambling...i just wanted to give my opinion on what i saw Everquest to be to me.. Great post and thanks for helping me and others I'm sure remember what the game is all about..we all forget from time to time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

After reading it I was reminded of my first days as an Erudite wizard, getting lost and confused in Erudin.  <br>
<br>
Here are some of the things that stood out to me.<br>
-Walking into the darkness of Tox forest thinking this was the whole world.<br>
-Riding the boat for the first time and admiring the view and sounds as it makes its way to Qeynos.<br>
-Seeing a Hill Giant for the first time and thinking 'Man, will I ever get to kill one of those.'<br>
-Meeting a ranger and then a rogue 2 hours later at level 19 who I've grouped with eversince 22 levels later.<br>
<br>
But the most breath taking of all... Making that first trip to Kunark, to meet my rogue and ranger friend, from Butcherblock and seeing Lake of Ill Omen for the first time at level 20.  The beauty of the ruins with hills and a big lake in the backdrop made me wonder about how beautiful a place such as ancient Greece once was. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugraffe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Graffe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Site Pyro</font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/27/01 7:06:55 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.graffe.com/graffe_cast.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Me and my soapbox</span><hr size=1> Verbalsabre, you have captured many of my feelings and have written them beautifully.  Countless times I have told people that EverQuest is the only game that has held my attention for this amount of time (I'm going on 2-1/2 years now).  That alone has to say something about it.  The game has it's faults but if you were to weigh the positives versus the negatives, you'd take quick notice that the positive side would be resting firmly on the floor.<br>
