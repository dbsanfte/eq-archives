It involves one member of a caster class (in this case wizards, but that's not the point) comparing attributes to another class, and then complaining about a lack of balance.  Subsequently members of the compared class reply with either a well thought out post, or (more commonly) a flame.  Example:<br>
<br>
Wizard A, &quot;Mages get comperable nukes as us wizards, and at level 34 even better!  Plus they get pets, DS, etc.  Aren't we the DD masters?  Well this proves that we aren't balanced!&quot;<br>
<br>
Mage A, &quot;No, because my pet is often a liability, and my nukes are more often resisted.  You get Lures to compensate, plus you get ports!  Fact is, we can't get into groups like the Enchanters with the CC, Clarity, etc. and they get pets!  They are group gods!&quot;<br>
<br>
Enchanter A, &quot;Excuse me?  My spells are magic based and resisted like crazy!  In the high MR Uber Mobs, I can't land a thing!  And don't get me started on the worthless pet we get!&quot;<br>
<br>
Okay, you get the idea!  Does this sound at all familiar?!  Part of the problem is by game implementation of the classes.  The way I saw the casters when I started was sort of like a tree model.  We all start out fairly similar (the trunk so to speak) but as we advance in levels, each of the classes would specialize in their art and become very distinct from one another (like the outermost tree branches).  This is not the case in EverQuest, and while I think it hurts all of the casters, in my opinion the wizard class took the brunt of it since damage spells are so easy to come up with and hand out.  Personally I don't want to do damage.  If I did, I wouldn't have chosen an enchanter (I feel this class has faired the best in all the blending and muddying that has happened).<br>
<br>
So why stand together?  Because in my not so humble opinion the casters are slowly being crushed by the melee classes.  Even the enchanters are feeling it with the super high resists of Velious.  Yes I know, we get group buffs so our presence is still desired, but I have tasted the power of CC and I don't want to let it go!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Since I don't play a wizard I can't imagine what it is like.  I would hazard a guess that the majority of people who bash another caster class haven't played that class in order to know what it is really like, and so base their opinions on numbers and/or seeing someone else play the class.  Okay, I'll get off the soapbox now (although the view is lovely! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  I hope we can get Verant to listen to our problems and not only fix those of the individual classes, but those that plague us all.<br>

someone says..Oh good! a Wizard..we should get some<br>
exps....guess what. Other group is tank heavy with<br>
a backstabbing rogue. <br>
<br>
It used to be...yes if you had a wizard in your group<br>
you had a good chance of sharing exps equally on a<br>
raid.<br>
<br>
Not the case now. I find I have to have a rogue with me<br>
in order to guarantee I get &quot;something&quot; out of the <br>
raid. The drops for wizards on the Plane of Fear are<br>
frankly..few and far between. Fright fingers come up<br>
empty most of the time..(well any time I've been there)<br>
<br>
At any rate, I now warn people in my raid group...if <br>
we're all casters..we will not be the exp group. We will<br>
be powerlevelling the tank group..basically.<br>
<br>
and OOM hehehe..always oom..in those places.<br>
<br>
but..don't sit down!! LOL<br>
<br>
I think those of us that have survived to post 50<br>
as wizards should be commended..its a long hard fight<br>
both physically for our characters..and fighting other<br>
people's attitudes.<br>
<br>
I had a high level tank say to me at a Fire Giant raid<br>
that wizards were a useless class..and why didn't I deleet<br>
my character. Heh<br>
<br>
I told him where he could put that idea..I was level <br>
50 at the time..<br>
<br>
I have 197 days played on my wizard char..she was<br>
the very first char I created when EQ launched...lots<br>
of time, love and energy invested in this character.<br>
<br>
Her birthday is March 17 1999...(my cd was late being delievered)<br>
<br>
So yes..I think we all deserve a pat on the back for<br>
making it this far..and making do with what little <br>

As I stated above, I don't play a wizard so I can only imagine the frustration you and members of your class go through when your only method by which to aid the group gets resisted time and time again.  Yes, high level wizards (and enchanters too but I'm biased!) should be commended for their hard work to get their class to where they are.  Thanks for your thoughts!

I'm going to bump this with an edit in light of the caster board.  Why are Magicians and Wizards fighting with each other?!!  If anything, they should be sticking the closest together since they are both suffering the most from the improvement of tanks.  Okay, let's all stand in a circle, hold hands, and sing Kumbyah!  Is that even spelled correctly?!! Well you know what I mean! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   LOL  Magic is Might!!!

<br>
<br>
Caster classes (int caster classes that is) have bacsically been pissed on since Kunark. We got some nice spells, al classes did, but the major upgrade, that was to the melee and wisdom casters.<br>
<br>
How much free mana were these classes given. Seems to me that every class post 45 BARRING the damn casters get easily attainable or purchasable free spell effects. Ok donals Breastplates are rare as hell.. And after they spotted how broken the JBB is they nerfed it's drop rate to hell, but there's still a zillion twinky shammies enjoying nuking every 8 seconds in every fight. <br>
<br>
This to me is where the game has gone very wrong. <br>
<br>
There are NO serious caster class specific drops in ACCESSIBLE Kunark.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile tanks got a massive AC upgrade ditching stats for it, but hey with a good shaman like who cares. And they got ice little enhancing soel effects to help themselves along a bit.<br>
<br>
The wisdom casters, once more get a bunch of free magic. Dammit clerics get a manafree ae, ok it's crap and who's really going to use it much, but why on earth they give clerics this???<br>
<br>
The caster upgrades in Kunark however were.... scarce. And being frank, not very effective either. We got more int and saves in kinda small numbers, and some pretty sparkly toys, but is this anything like the difference between Indicolite (or more important to those starting out) crafted and Cobalt. Or armour classes Fear/Hate drops and their Kunark equivalents.<br>
<br>
THe weapons increases at the same rate. The standard toy of the high level warrior (not talking uber stuff here) went from the 8/24 ssoy, to the 9/19 lamentation.<br>
<br>
Chanters got faster and better haste spells. Faster and better haste items began to drop not off just these few dragons and on hard PoSky quests.<br>
<br>
The net result, melee became the best way to deal damage by far. The only pure caster who really kept a grouping role was the chanter, and that was mainly coz the melee are hankering after their buffs, and hey mez is useful.<br>
<br>
The other caster classes from that day on are all kinda sitting on the sidelines waiting for groups that do not ask for tank/tank/rogue/cleric/shaman/chanter.<br>
<br>
So every now and then I'll get a job as evaccer, or as snare.<br>
<br>
Every now and then a mage will get a role thanks to CoH, and as there's no tank lfg and he kinda helps there a bit.<br>
<br>
And the necro, well they can kinda snare, and hey they can pump the cleric.... Guess the do damage too...<br>
<br>
Is this how we thought our classes would be seen when we started?<br>
<br>
This situation, just got worse thanks to velious. Now every caster class gets the shaft.<br>
<br>
And they gave us drops!!! be honest look at the plane of growth caster drops. Look at your old plane equivalent.<br>
<br>
How much better is it really?<br>
<br>
<br>
I know in the most part I would prefer the carmine.<br>
<br>
<br>
And the effects suck for the most part.<br>
<br>
<br>
For wizards they gave some attainable yet no drop Direct damage finally and it does a whopping 350 damage per 29 seconds. Ok it's hard to resist (like that's gonna help much in velious where on a shed load of mobs damn lure is 90% resisted anyway) and stops you from carrying out maybe your most vital back up role (that of Evaccer) for half a min per cast.  Seriously do we deserve that insult?<br>
<br>
And chanters, You guys get a rune 4 with no mana (sounds good!) but it eats a damn peridot. Same problem as our hate staff... basicaly it sucks too.<br>
<br>
The necro robe is kinda handy for those failed raids, saves them a bunch of mana then... and better than their duck stick effect no doubt.<br>
<br>
Sorry can't remember magician ones... you guys happy with it?<br>
<br>
I dunno I'm kinda sick of being a second class citizen here. Tired of raids where I know there is nothing that will drop that I could even vaguely use. When Velious came out I remember seeing caster drops that looked good (unlike Kunark where I remember distinctly an abscence of them barring the drachnid thxyl for ages).<br>
<br>
Trust is there's no change. We got no real upgrades in velious, a few pretty embelishments and utility spells.... Oh and chanters got a way of making tanks even more silly hard (Werewolf is frankly obscene). But for ourselves. Same old story.... There's some nice caster stuff out there. Too true. But is it really fair to have to Complete Veeshans Peak for our class specific breastplates in Kunark, whereas everyone else only has to do Trak?<br>
<br>
This to me is the heart of the balance issue. It is totally screwing with the lower level game, thanks to the droppable nature of this armour and weapons. There are a million tank twinks out there every day who can happily solo all the way to 30 with no help whatsoever, from the daft kit they have. The longer the game progresses the worse this will get it's not hard to get the stuff to twink and mainly cobalt warrior, just takes time.<br>
<br>
Sorry to rant. But had to put my all in here. Ok I find trouble sympathsing with a class that while I spend 3 hours plus hoping a group somewhere in seb wants me (aka a friend turns up). I see nothing but requests for you guys... Hey that's how we should all be, I sit there kinda jealous like often enough admittedly. But I remember chanters when they sucked... I remember them being the leppers of Norrath (you and rogues).<br>
<br>
I remember verant actually fixing you guys.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope they fix the rest of us..<br>
<br>
Not just wizards, mages and necros too.<br>
<br>
And stop you poor folks from being nothing but haste/clarity dispensers in Velious.<br>

<br>
In response:<br>
<br>
Hey, it's okay to rant!  I also want to emphasize that as I have already stated, enchanters are fairing the best in my opinion.  I in no way want any sympathy from anyone.  Every problem I am currently having is felt by the other three Int casters ten fold (these being resists and equipment issues).  My main problem is that I will often see what I stated above.  Some class complains about not being as effective as another caster or not getting a spell like another caster.  The compared class then lashes back.  This helps no one because the real issue (exponential increase of melee power) is lost in the flames.<br>
<br>
I whole heartedly agree with your complaint about group friendliness.  Why is it that most of the classes are forced to be so limited in their play style if they want to group?!  Velious Example:<br>
<br>
Wizards:  With the high MR Wizards are forced to use lures.  With the high HP of the mobs not much damage is done before the Wizard needs to med.  Can evac if things get ugly, but clerics nullify this with their rezz.  Therefore, a Wizard's role is to scratch the surface of a mob!<br>
<br>
Magicians:  With high MR Magicians can hardly land anything on the mobs.  High HP eliminate what little usefulness their DD spells do.  Stronger mobs quickly kill pets, while any pet that exerts its own will (ie. is feared or poorly controlled by Magician) is a liability, and so is not welcome.  Summoned weapons are not useful.  Damage shields can at least be used, but aren't that effective (not to mention Druids have better ones).  Magician's role is Call of the Hero and Damage shields.<br>
<br>
Necromancers:  High MR mobs hurt Necromancers like Wizards and Magicians.  Have the same pet problems as Magicians.  Necromancer's role is mana battery!  (Oh how the mighty have fallen, this must be a sick joke on VI's part.)<br>
<br>
Enchanters:  With high MR, Crowd Control isn't possible.  Pet is even more useless than Magician and Necromancer's.  Enchanter's role:  Haste and Clarity casts.  (I feel like a drug dealer)<br>
<br>
Granted this is Velious, but I think it is good to use BECAUSE it so strongly brings out the fact that all four have become limited to one or two purposes despite the great variety of spells each class could use.  Furthermore, the only reason Enchanters fair so well is because we support the tanks and clerics.  This role is fine by me, but it leaves the other three which are much more damage oriented in the cold.  This is why I feel casters should stand together.  Right now Enchanters are fine.  However, at the rate things are going we will be reduced to a luxury class, and finally not wanted.  Better to stand with my three caster class brethren and nip it in the bud rather than have no one left to stand for me.<br>

Verant is trying to balance something, that under the principle of the D&amp;D type game, was simply never meant to be balanced in the first place.<br>
<br>
 I agree with the enchanters views on many things, but then again there are some i dont. One for isnatnce is the roughly stated we have utility spells. &lt;shrug&gt; Not picking on you, but like many classes they do not know what a wizard has. For instance do you know how many times druids, and rangers say &quot; Wizards get snare ?!? &quot; I'm sure other wizards get that alot too, seems to be even more prominant since i got past lvl 50. The biggest problem for our class IMHO, our true purpose is damage. Yet almost all casting classes are campareable. Nothing as far as our utility, snares, ports, ect cant be found in other existing classes. Wizards arnt a jack of all trades, not is our defining feature &quot; The Best &quot; . All the mathamatitions can crunch numbers all they want as far as ratios, but now matter how fast the damage is done, the damage still gets done. To say that if wizards cast times were longer, would effect us is incorrect. We have only one way to do damage, and if verant made a change like that we would have to do one of two things. Stop playing or just keep casting a long cast, ungodly mana using, way too long re cast spells. So that argument agravetes amny wizards, ok so we cast marginaly faster then other damage casters. Myself i say Big Deal. Marginaly is still marginaly. Heres a decent example. An Enchanter can do croud controll, and they do it better then anyone, hands down. Yes a necro can screaming terro for croud controll, and wizards can park mobs (assuming the park spells hold), and several other classes can do it marginaly as well too. But heres the kicker, the enchanter is &quot; The Best &quot; croud controll class in the game. Period. Its a defining trait. Other classes have their defining traits too, wether int or wis caster they all have them. (Admits it may be several types of spells that make that definition but its still there, i.e. druids master of transportation: Ports to everywhere sv the planes, SOW, and various Wolf Forms) But what does a wizard have. What defines them to where there can be no question can be asked of what our primary specilaty is. We are supposed to be (in theory) masters of magical damage and deffence. I'm not even going to go into the magical defence talks, for we arnt even the master of the formost said magical damage. That is a wizards main gripe. If it seems we bash other classes, i dont think we are, we are simply comparing. If we seem to be bashing, im sure everyone agrees that we apologize to the others, specialy other int casters. <br>
<br>
I do agree we are all feeling the heat from the better equipment melee classes are getting. But IMHO wizards are trying to get our first priority taken care of and thats damage. Enchanters, went through their gauntlet to get fixed, and finaly did, now they find that other things need to be fixed. As wizards we are still trying to get the first of those two things done. We are still catching up to the other classes. Sadly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Sorry if it seems like a rant or just a repeat of many others posts. But i feel many others still do not see the logic in the wizards complaints. I may have rambled a bit here, have alot on my mind, but i think i got alot of the main points across (hopes he did anyways).<br>
<br>
We all need to be re looked at (looked at for the first time for wizards) as far as how we stand versus melees, but our class has to get something done first to catch us up to the others before we can move on to the other problems we all feel as a whole (INT casters).<br>
<br>
Concerend for us Int casters, and Wizards,<br>

<br>
This does make a big difference since we don't need a healer, and may be the reason why the tanks are allowed to do so much damagee...<br>
<br>
...but I think that the flipside to this is the fact that we CAN'T take damage when we do our damage. What they did with the rogues is balance out the fact that they can't take hits quite as well as the warrior-types and give them an insane damage output in the 'right situation'. I think that's where they need to look for balance (and stop using useless things like a %10 better casting time to separate us from the other classes)<br>
