Fixed?  I think the term &quot;Adjusted&quot; would fit the situation better.  But I disagree with the path you are attempting to take.<br>
<br>
The Wizard's biggest problem, as I see it, deal with damage per second.  And most people attempt to generate this number with an equation like this (Max damage per cast / casting time + recast time + recovery time).  The problem I see with this is it does not take into effect med time, and can not be used effectively with AE spells.<br>
<br>
So I have tried a new equation (damage * number of mobs affected / CT + RT+ recover + med time)<br>
<br>
The old equation states Elnerick's Electrical Rending has a damage/sec of 189.  The new equation gives the same spell a damage/sec of 14, without any buffs strictly straight med by a level 60.  <br>
<br>
We all know melee are claiming damage/second numbers of 100+.  If we adjusted the damage in the new equation to get the d/s equal to 100.  The spell would now do 13600 damage per cast.  We reduce the mana on the spell to generate the 100 d/s.  Now we would have to reduce the mana by 93%.  This would allow the wizard to do 158,760 in a full burn of all his mana chain casting this spell.  Now if we adjusted the amount of mana wizards regen we can obtain 100 d/s.  It would only take obtaining FT items that would allow 330 mana regen per tick.  This option allows VI to keep full burn damage the same, max damage per spell the same.  But it allows wizards to become solo gods.  <br>
<br>
Therefore I submit to all of you that VI has their back against the wall when it comes to wizard balance.  As with all these adjustments it places wizards more powerful than the &quot;Vision&quot; allows.<br>
<br>
Possible solutions?  possibly hard code an adjustment in the grouping code that adjusts the mana wizards regen according to the number of people in the group.  This would eliminate the solo gods title.  Yet increase d/s.  <br>
<br>
I personally believe that wizards are damage dealers and need to be balanced against the other damage dealers in the game.  Even if those other damage dealers are melee.  But right now it is impossible with the current spell system in my opinion.<br>

That's why I don't give the exact number that's needed to boost us.  Also, as I mention, focus items, if they boost our damage output by a decent level WILL do the job in balancing the class. <br>
<br>
Now, I disagree with you on how fast our mana regen should be.  Yes, it SHOULD be faster, but our ability to pump out a bar of mana against a mob or mobs is balanced against the melee disciplines.  Add ot this that we are talking about the difference between inherant ability vs. ability caused by items(melees).  This is why focus items should be the source of a lot of the balance.<br>
<br>
A naked melee is fairly useless in any fight that gives experience.  A naked caster with spells is often able to handle mobs.  This is why simply boosting the ability of casters without having equipment being the key factor would only cause more problems.<br>
<br>
So, focus items reducing casting times, increasing damage, reducing agro, and increasing spell duration(such as roots, DOT spells, and even rains) would go a long way to solving our issues.  And to be honest, being able to do huge damage on one bar of mana without equipment would be a bit overpowered IF it were possible to do this without equipment.  I agree that increasing our damage/second is key to the whole balance issue, I simply see the need to have it be a function of equipment rather than any other method.  <br>

We have both brought up many valid point and a few shakey ones.<br>
<br>
I would like to address a quote from you real fast as it confused me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't understand how our ablitiy to burn a full bar of mana is balanced against the melee disiplines?  We have the ability to burn a full bar starting at level 1 yet melee disiplines start at level 51.<br>
<br>
I am just starting to dive into the fray on the inherant ablities vs item ablities.  I only see this as a real problem during the low level portion of the game.  Where as in the high end, items mean so much to all classes. With a naked wizard while they still have their spells their mana pool can be cut in half or better.  Yes a naked melee may be useless in any battle that gives exp.  The usefullness of a wizard is also drastically diminished.  <br>
<br>
Now as for Focus items.  I see focus items being similar to the 10/22 weapons.  There are a large number of 10/22 weapons in the game.  Some with stat boosts, and some with spell effects.  To clarify I see the focus items generating diversity for casters.  So the casters can customize their toon to meet the needs they see placed before them.  I do not see focus items balancing the wizard class.<br>
<br>
Like I stated increasing the damage/second is the only way I can see of increaseing the damage/minute and damage/hour.  I disagree with the idea that by increasing the damage of a spell by 20% or even 80% will increase the damage/second.  The down time, the meditation time is the killer.  When all our post 50 (single target) DD's average 320 mana a spell, it takes a level 60 (no buffs straight med) approx 75 seconds to gain that back.  <br>
<br>
Balance needs to be the first and foremost issue.  I don't want to be a god class.  I want to be balanced, needed, useful and welcome in a group class.  And the only way I see this happening is through adjusting the mana regen on wizards.  If that is done through hard-code, or items I don't really care.  I just don't want it done through buffs.  Because with buffs you have to be in the group to get the buffs and the biggest problem we have is getting in the group.  Once all the damage dealers have been balanced across the board.  Then that gives the Dev team a way to balance other parts of the game such as agro and item distribution.<br>
<br>
If they did look at this idea, and decided to implement it.  I could foresee a mix of items and hard code as the best way to go about it. <br>

I was talking more in terms of overall balance, if the focus items are implemented to balance us.  IF we were to be balanced long term, so that the damage we do with spells/second+mana regen time for those spells were balanced against melee damage output.<br>
<br>
So, the game is balanced, melees doing long term what a wizard does in a single nuke(with focus items to improve casting speed, and to add damage), and counting the regen time of the mana so the wizard keeps to the same general damage output.  Now, the wizard ability to cast down a bar of mana quickly is what I mean is offset by the melee disciplines.  Our regen time in this case would let us continue to keep up with melee damage output on an ongoing basis.  The melee &quot;spurts&quot; of damage would be used up and our ability to burn down a bar of mana is &quot;used up&quot;, so the balance is kept.<br>
<br>
I know the classes arn't balanced right now, we STILL don't have our focus items, so we can't even see if they balance us, but once they go in, if we find that melee disciplines and equipment are able to let them continue to outdamage us in the long term, things might be BETTER, but things will still be broken.  Wizard/caster damage output plus regen time MUST be balanced against melee damage output(that has no regen time).  We may need to push for more mana regen if focus items don't do it, or for a boost to the level that clarity provides, but that's for later and would be speculation about how good focus items will really be.<br>
