The cavet is that you need to kiss your Druid faction goodbye.<br>
<br>
Treants are deffintily the way to go for fast leveling in the 20s.<br>
<br>
I decided that I had my own ports and EVACs, so why do I need it.<br>
<br>
KFC is good, as is outer paw starting around 23 (that's when I started landing more than resists).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To date, only once has it been a near-problem.  I stepped AFK a for minute on auto and my oh-so-not-bright group leader nearly ran me head long into one (came back about 5 steps shy of Agro).<br>
<br>
<br>
The exp is VERY fast in LOIO, if you can get a decent group.  I've been in groups there, recently as my monk, that were pulling constantly..  Others that couldn't handle more than 3 mobs without down time.<br>
<br>

<br>
There's so much xp there to be had, it's great.  You can start at the mill and work your way up to sarnak groups at 23 or 24.  If you have good INT, at 24 you can quad with SoW and Column of Lightning... there's a great 4 spawn of gobbies, or you can pull 4 out of the snark fort if it's not too busy.  Just look out for sowed snarks... that's why gobs are really better.  this zone is the bomb, and will take you all the way to 30... which is when i moved to Frontier Mountains and did giant groups till 35... got me 2 forest loops and plenty of other items and made some good cash.<br>
<br>
Not to mention the Lvl 29 ports to Gfay and Tox.  Lots of people would rather port thank boat the trip back, so you can make some good pp there.<br>

Actually I popped it 3 times that day, but that is another story all together.  It is harder than heck to get a group at our level.  I went to Ill Omen at level 21 and fought at the gob tower for about an hour and a 1/2 and gained a full level.  I was in a four person group.  Bottom line in 4 RL days of playing, a couple hours a day, I went from 21 to 24+.  It is still hard to find groups there and there are constantly wizzy LFG in the zone.   There are also many calls for SOW'ers, healers, and melee.  Best way to play it I have found is to find a place to fight and then pick up the LFG people.  Easy to get SOW and Breeze here for free, too.  That's cool.<br>
<br>
***WARNING***<br>
Just put that force shock away since it is resisted most of the time here.  I used my lvl 16 lightning bolt and fire shock.  I mostly used my bolt because (and I guess this could be an exploit, but if they havent' fixed it by now they probably wont) if you stand on a hill when you shoot your bolt you will occasionally get a double hit with it.  250 Damage for 80 mana! Of course you will get aggro'd at that much but hey that is what your shieldskin is for.  Make sure you get to loot an occasional Sarnak - they drop plat but you wont see it if you don't loot them.<br>
<br>
BTW I was fighting at the giant fort in FM at 23, so you don't have to wait to go to FM if you are in a group.  But the hard Red giant resisted all my spells.  I even got to kite a white con while my group fought off two others.  Loads of fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urashakra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rashakra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/13/01 5:05:43 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Help please.....</span><hr size=1> I pretty much stopped grouping at 26 cause of the lack of desire for a wizzie... Not sure why...  I pretty much stuck to ice spells only for snarks... magic is almost worthless against them (force shock sucks, yes) and fire is resisted often.  cold is the way to go.<br>
<br>
I quadded all the way to 30 from there and grouped when i got an invite from the peeps that i had gotten to know by chatting.<br>
<br>
Honestly, that's the best way to get in a group in that zone.  Make friends...they'll tell you when there's an opening. <p>Rashakra N'Faria<BR>

I am having much better luck after 5 days in the zone.  I have made a lot of friends and maybe changed a few minds about weather wizzy's can benefit a group or not.  Last night I saw that a druid I had grouped with my first day was LFG.  So I gave her a tell, since my group was breaking up.  She said that she was meeting another druid in FM and that I could come if I wanted.  Great fun fighting the giants there. <br>
<br>
Of course, I died once but hey it's part of the game.  Why would a giant aggro on you when it is beating up your tank and you haven't cast a spell on them? I did do 400+ damage to his friend that was our current target, but I was well out of his aggro range (or so I thought).  Never had it happen like that before. Oh well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showMessage?topicID=101.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showMessage?topicID=97.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.emailToFriend?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.threadControl?topicID=104.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=104.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=104.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm31">Fusibility Research<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm11">Velium Chill of Al'Kabor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm6">Tome of Ages Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm30">Veeshan's Peak Key</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19>Soloing</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
