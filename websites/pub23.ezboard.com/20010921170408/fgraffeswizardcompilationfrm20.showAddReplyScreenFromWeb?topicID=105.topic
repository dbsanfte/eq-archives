The xp is tremendous.  I'm half-way through 45.<br>
<br>
Here's some notes for solo and multi-kiting:<br>
<br>
1.  Drakkel Dire Wolves in GD are now green and no longer worth my time or energy.  They are the easiest quad-kite going before level 45.<br>
<br>
2.  Ferocious Kodiaks in GD are now green, but Savage and above Kodiaks are still blue.  Hardly anyone bothers to camp the Kodiak caves and getting four can be fairly easy if you run into the cave and agro them.<br>
<br>
The Kodiak caves are near the Velk entrance.  From the dragon circle, run out the archway straight.  You'll find Kodiaks.<br>
<br>
3.  Elder Shardwurms in GD are solo-able.  I haven't tried an Ancient at 45, but at 44 I could not solo an Ancient.<br>
<br>
4.  The Coldain huts in EW just South of Kael Drakkel has Icefang the dire wolf and some ghostly Coldain (only at night).  Around these huts are tons and tons of walruses. <br>
<br>
The walruses are very easy to quad-kite with lots of open spaces around the huts to run.  They were mostly blue to me at 44 and a lot of xp.  Terrible loot.  <br>
<br>
Killing walruses will spawn the Ulthork Man-o-War at this site.  I could not solo a Man-o-War at 44 unless I got extremely lucky.  They resist a lot and have a ton of HP.<br>
<br>
5.  Ulthorks North of the bridge in EW are excellent xp and loot.  In fact, I find myself going back here all the time simply because the loot is so good.  I probably make 20pp or more on items and cash from each set of four Ulthorks I quad.<br>
<br>
Ulthork Hunters are now all green at 45.  About two-thirds of these green Hunters still give me xp, though.  The Warriors are all blue.<br>
<br>
Hunters and Warriors each drop Ulthork Tusks at about the same rate.  For every four tusks you can go to Chief Kalan in CS and turn them into him for a gem or item.  So far, I've gotten a Blue Diamond, Diamond, two Sapphire Necklaces (worth 132pp at vendor), a Jacinth, and a Black Sapphire.<br>
<br>
I'm hooked on the tusks.<br>
<br>
The Wooley Rhinos and Walruses in this area are tied to the Ulthork spawn.  If there are no Ulthorks, kill the Rhinos and Walruses.<br>
<br>
The Rhinos are blue and have a ton of HP.  I could solo one at 40, but it took all my mana.  At 45, I can multi-kite only two Rhinos.  <br>
<br>
Rhinos are *not* on any faction, so when they get to the critical health level, they stop following me in a group.  As a result, you must solo finish the Rhinos.  I must cast Harvest to kill both.<br>
<br>
6.  Wyverns in CS are terrific.  If you attack one and another is nearby, it will agro on you.  Wyverns have a bit over 3000 hp, so you won't be able to multi-kite them.  <br>
<br>
I've found pulling them down to the beach is the best bet for avoiding the drakes.  However, some of the Wyverns will gate back to their spawn point.  You will have to run up the cliffs and back to the Wyvern's spawn point to finish it off. <br>
<br>
I've found the Wyverns to be very heavily camped at times.  I've only killed about 10 or so and have gotten only one gem and that was vendor trash worth 37pp.  Wyvernd do drop cash and other items.<br>
<br>
If I get two Wyverns, I'll snare both, nuke one to death by kiting both, then run to the Wyvern tower and zone into Skyshrine to clear agro.  You must be Dubious+ with CoV to use this technique.<br>
<br>
I'm primarily hunting Ulthorks now because I'm hoping for another blue diamond from the tusks.  Some pulls I'll get two tusks.  Other times, I'll kill 20 Ulthorks with no tusks.  At 45, I could potentially quad Warriors and have a bubble of mana left -- IF I could find four Warriors (which I normally can not). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utegellan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tegellan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/9/01 3:33:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Spankda Updage -- Level 45</span><hr size=1>  Hehe gotta love your updates, they have a ton of good info for lower level wizards, that way i can always seem like the helpful knowing wizards when the lower level wizards I know ask me for good places to hunt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

These and Bic's guide last week finally convinced me to start quadding at level 36.  I started out with the single and double pulls in OT, but promptly moved to EW after reading Bic's guide and haven't looked back.  I've since reached 39 and have taken a break to enjoy my new-found mobility and work on some tradeskills.  So, thanks to both of you guys for your assistance and information; it's been most helpful.<br>
<br>
Now, for some questions on things that you mentioned in your post.<br>
<br>
1 - When can I go to CS to dump my tusks and how should I go about this?  I've heard it's very difficult.  My bank is filling up with them but I want to cash them in for gems rather than sell them.<br>
<br>
2 - How did you get dubious with Cov?<br>

<br>
Okay, some words on getting to Cobalt Scar.<br>
<br>
First, the pathway is from EW *through* Kael Drakkel to Wakening Lands to Skyshrine.<br>
<br>
In Skyshrine, you need a key to get to Cobalt Scar.  Ideally, you /ooc in the zone and some nice people group with you and take you.<br>
<br>
I did exactly that except I got my own key.  You get the key to Skyshrine in one of two ways:  Kill Zilgark Whisperwing or do his quest.<br>
<br>
I chose the death route.  It wasn't easy.  I got lucky and a couple of guild mates just happened to be in the zone and helped me.  Whisperwing is level 25 and not a problem to kill.  It's the guardians nearby that are the problem.  He drops the Skyshrine key.<br>
<br>
Okay.  You either have the key or you are grouped with someone with the key.  You go to this big room with a dragon statue in it in the middle of the room.  Take out the key and put it on your cursor.  Click the key on the statue.  You're now in Cobalt Scar.<br>
<br>
Getting through Kael is tricky.  Get a good map.  You will need to be invisible throughout the Kael journey.  It's very scary.  I've done it twice and both times were tense.  <br>
<br>
In WL, remain invisible and get the key to the WL dragon circle.  This way, if anything bad happens, you can always port back and not have to pass through Kael again.  <br>
<br>
Beware Woushi.  Some report he sees invis.  Some say he doesn't.  In all liklihood, Woushi will occassionally self-buff with see invis.<br>
<br>
Run along the zone line to Skyshrine.<br>
<br>
Get a good map of Skyshrine and go to the dragon statue.<br>
<br>
Get a good map of Cobalt Scar.  The tooth-key is on a big boulder in the middle of the dragon circle.  Remain invis if you're KOS to CoV.<br>
<br>
Once you have the CS tooth, you can destroy the GD and WL teeth.  This is Verant's way of making the number of soul-bound items below eight.  I only have the CS tooth and I port to GD and WL all the time.<br>
<br>
I did all of this by myself with just maps from eqmaps.com and the key that I got by killing Whisperwing with help.<br>
<br>
Cov Faction:  I got down to dubious by killing lots and lots and lots and lots of giants in GD.  Basically, by the time you are WARMLY with the Coldain, you are likely to be dubious with CoV.  For sure, by the time you're ALLY with the Coldain, you'll be Dubious with CoV. <br>
<br>
Note the only way to check your faction with CoV is to go to Skyshrine and /con the guards while not invisible.  You will not be able to shop in Skyshrine until you're better than dubious.  I'm not sure if Apprehensive is good enough.<br>
<br>
Wyverns in CS are on the CoV faction but killing them does *NOT* lower your CoV faction.  So, while they won't agro on me, I can kill them with impunity.<br>
<br>
I'm able to bank in Skyshrine with Dubious faction.<br>
<br>
The Skyshrine key is also soulbound.  I now have two soulbound items in my inventory:  CS tooth and Skyshrine key.<br>
<br>
Once you have the CS tooth you can theoretically destroy the Skyshrine key.  I'm keeping mine because I can now lead groups through to CS.  Likewise, I often zone into SS to heal up.  Then, I use the key to zone back into CS to hunt Wyverns.<br>
<br>
The safest place to meditate and go AFK is in the tower in CS that leads to SS.  However, there is a possibility of someone training Bulthar or Sirens up there and zoning themselves and leaving you to take the brunt of the beatings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uamankhann45.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amankhann45</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/9/01 9:47:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Skyshrine and CS</span><hr size=1> Wow, thanks for all the great information, Spankda!

One question for you - Where can I find a good map of Kael?  EQAtlas doesn't have one up yet.  Do you know of any other places to check?  EQMaps is now charging for access, and I'd rather avoid that site if at all possible.<br>

<br>
Only time I ever saw a shardwurm in GD, it handed my ass to me on a plate.  I don't know which ones are/aren't casters (or what type I had, someone trained it on me, it was blue so I tried to kite it), and I have horrible resists.  I couldn't get a nuke through it's faster-casting, interrupting nukes.  At 20% HP I hadn't hit it yet, so I ran outta range and gated out.<br>
<br>
The Ulthork warriors in EW are still blue at 47 (haven't looked at 48, I think they still are though), but I have to spend so much time killing greens to get enough of them that it's not worth the time to do them for exp.  I still find myself back there now and then for the tusks though.  I was quadding for exp here starting at around 41 (wish I had started sooner), and could quad the warriors then (200 int, maybe 30 or 40 in +mana).<br>
<br>
Walruses are just zone garbage for me now, but the wolly rhino's are blue, and not bad exp.  I quadded them a bit at lvl 45/46, but they don't stay together at the end.  Usually most of them would go to run mode at the same time, and I'd just root the one/two that would still follow me, and then nuke/harvest/med them to death one at a time.  If one falls out of the pack early, loop back with triple, root the single one and come back to it later after another AE on whats left.  This is also not bad if you have a partner.  There was a 35 druid here quadding walruses when I was doing the rhino's.  If he got an add he couldn't handle, or was oom at the end I'd drop and AE to finish them.  And when I was oom, he'd drop a nuke on the one or 2 rooted rhino's still left.  We were both getting solo exp, but it was safer and easier for both of us.<br>
<br>
I've been doing the wyverns in CS a bit now.  Compared to quadding the exp is quite slow (full bar of mana to kill one blue, or full bar to kill 4 blues, easy math), but is also easier and safer I find.  Being KOS to CoV I kite up and down the beach (othmir love me because of the ulthork quadding).  Lev and invis and run up the hill to find a nice target (and make sure no drakes are near), run off cliff and when a bit away hit the flux staff.  Easy going from there, I've never had a problem with getting an add.  I can't wait for 51, when I get a spell capable of quadding them with.  I think your estimation of their HP is a bit off though, I find them to be more in the range of 3500 to 4000 HP.  (stuff in the 2500 to 3000 range is what I look for to quad)  Also, they don't gate back to spawn point - they warp when they hit run mode.  If you watch their HP carefully and don't run out of spell range when they get low, I find they don't warp.<br>
<br>
Also, I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere here before, but I found quadding sarnak knights in OT to be great exp from 45 to 48 (as in good in 47 to get to 48, I think they may be too green now, may have to single-kite for a few lvl's as I can't find anything good now).  Seeing as they seem a relatively new idea around here, I'll put up a quick guide about how I do it.<br>
<br>
Note:  this may be dangerous if you are KOS to the goons, I am not.  But if you are careful you shouldn't have any problems.<br>
<br>
Starting at the SF zone/ramp (where I med up between pulls), run down to the road, and turn right - towards FM.  Follow the road down the bottom of that valley, pulling any sarnaks that are blue that you see along the way with the staff/something else.  Don't use snare to pull though, or it'll be broken by the time you get 4.  Chickens and cactuses run the same speed as the sarnaks if you want to include them in the pull, but they will drop out of the quad at low HP, and you have to kill them singly afterwards.  Tigers and rhino's are faster (tigers I can barely outrun with jboots, rhino's kick my butt to the zone), avoid aggro'ing them while pulling at all costs.  The path I follow while looking/pulling continues down the road (bottom of that valley, watching both hillsides) to just past the crossroad in front of FM.  Then I turn left (into the zone) over a little hill and the sarnak fort/ruin should be in front of you.  Run past this but leave some clearance, you don't want to pull anything from inside the ruin, though there are wonderers around the outside of it sometimes to grab.  Turning left more there is a large plain on the back-side of the hill that formed the valley of the road.  Following the back-side of this hill around (again, you will be in a small valley, watch both sides for sarnaks) you will come back to the small yellow lake in front of SF.  A quick loop around that lake and by then I usually have my 4 victims.  I usually like to pull them over the hill towards the outpost, and kill them in the large flat area there (hills mess with spell range I find) though sometimes I turn towards SF and kite around that lake.<br>
<br>
There are a couple things to be careful of when doing this.<br>
<br>
1. Rhino's will ruin your day, stay away from them.  If you get one and are close to the zone, zone.  If you don't have any sarnaks mad at you yet, stop and root it, then you can step back, snare, and single-kite as usual.  If you already have a train you'll have to take beats from the rhino (they don't bash at least, never been stunned by it and had the train catch me too) till you get far enuf from the train to stop and root the rhino.  Then you can pull the train off and quad them far away while the rhino forgets about you.  Zone to clear aggro completly before starting another quad though.<br>
<br>
2.  Sometimes sarnaks will have SoW.  If you get a SoW'd one in your group, treat it like a rhino.  But you can prevent SoW'd sarnaks from wandering the zone.  Head to that fort near FM, and one at a time slaughter ever caster in there.  If you invis, scout it out, and target the caster, then run out of spell range, and slowly get closer 1 step at a time so you are at max range you can cast on it through the wall and he won't bring any friends from inside with him (95% of the time).  I usually root him through the wall from max range, then procede to nuke him to death.  Often they don't break root before they are dead.  If they do I can get them re-rooted before they get to me, then snare them out there (don't want to use the AE on them when they are near friends, might hit extra's) and kite as usual.  Keep slaughtering casters till melee's take the spawns, and then don't pull from inside there anymore.  Casters only spawn as statics, and I only quad wanderers.  Usually takes me 1/2 an hour to an hour to clear the casters, and then I can quad for hours and hours and not see a single SoW'd sarnak.<br>
<br>
3. Goons.  If you're KOS, pretty self explanetory.  If you're not, stay away from them anyways.  They will latch onto your quad, and the last thing you want is to catch him in your AE.  I was so incredibly close to doing that once that I stay as far away from them as possible now.  I would have died there, but the goon happened to be on the sarnak I had targeted, and just before I cast the spell he killed the knight, and I got a &quot;you must have a target&quot; message instead of a mad goon.<br>
<br>
4. The large plain out by the fort, but back farther towards the pit where HS is.  Scorpicus's there are on VS faction (same as goons), so they don't bother me.  But there are tunnels under the plain there and I've caught ones that I can't see underground in AE's before.  Being harm-touched by something you can't see through 500 feet of rock really sucks.<br>
<br>
It can be dangerous at times (more so than quadding other things, say ulthorks), but I went through lvl 45 in record time (less than 10 hours of play time, prolly closer to 5 to 7 hours), and 46 and 47 were cake too (about 1/2 green at 47, though still giving exp.  Haven't tried at 48, though I expect them to be too green to be worth it.)<br>
<br>
Oh, and because this is my first post, I must take this opportunity to say that ez-board pisses me off.  I don't like having to register, and this board is more of a pain than most (eg. UBB has a nice simple registration).  And I wanna know who stole my nick.  I've never seen a post by Cova on here before (I've been reading for a long time, never bothered to register to post before), but it kept saying my nick was taken - and yes I registered a local user name.  Graffe, if your server can run ASP pages I'll port the forums I'm writing for some other things over to ya and give ya the source code and everything for free.  No ad's, very simple registration (enter name and pass, done.), and with the code you can do whatever you want with it.<br>

<br>
for most of my reall good maps.<br>
<br>
I learnd to multi-kite at The Overthere, so I would have to agree with everything Cova posted.  However, I left after I attempted to quad four Sarnak Berzerkers, and they were all SoW'd.<br>
<br>
A note on the Kunark Rhinos:  They run at a SoW equivalent to their level.  If you can get a 50'ish SoW on, you can likely outrun them okay.  I have not tried that.  I just avoided them completely or died when I agro'd one.<br>
<br>
At 45 I'm unable to fully quad-kite the Wooley Rhinos.  I don't know how you're able to do that, Cova.  Maybe you're better at judging the right nuke to finish them off individually. <br>
<br>
When I multi-kite Wooley Rhinos, I kill two.  I get both or just one down to stagger point and finish off the rhino with the most health with a final Conflag.  Then, I Harvest, and finish off the second.  At that point, I am completely and totally OOM.  <br>
<br>
I've tried using a smaller nuke than Conflag but with partial resists and all, I had to use two which was more mana inefficient than one Conflag would have been.<br>
<br>
Two Wooley Rhinos at 45 is pretty good XP.  About a quarter of a blue bubble or better.<br>
<br>
As a bonus, I get to intersperse killing Ulthorks and collecting tusks.  My last two sets gave me a 132pp sapphire neckace and a ruby.  I'm still looking for another blue diamond.  <br>
<br>
I've pretty much decided I'm not going to kite Wyverns until I hit 51 and get the next usable AoE.  They're just too mana inefficient and too slow XP wise.<br>
<br>
Rhinos will be blue for a long time.  They're blue to my son's 52 druid, so they're a good possibility for a while.  Also, I'm thinking quad-kiting in the DL may be a future choice.  I will also look at kiting in EJ up near the FoB entrance.  The area there looks flat and clear.<br>
<br>
I made a full orange bubble yesterday killing Ulthorks and Rhinos in EW.  I think that's pretty good for 45.  I may not break any records, but I know people who have been stuck in 45 for weeks.  I expect to be out of 45 in another day or so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uspankda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spankda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/10/01 4:13:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> A Note On Shardwurms</span><hr size=1> Per Cova's note on being owned.  A couple notes on Shardwurms:<br>
<br>
I've been able to solo Elder Shardwurms since 39 or so.  All Shardwurms seem to be casters with the ability to actually gate.<br>
<br>
However, Elder Shardwurms are easily snarable with one or possibly two resists, and I had the mana to kill them. <br>
<br>
The thing about Shardwurms is they have an incredibly large hit radius.  Unlike most mobs where they actually have to run close to you to hit your, Shardwurms can be far away and whack you good.<br>
<br>
They're just very big.  The difference between your casting radius and their hit radius is small.  So, just as you are able to cast, they're almost able to thwack you good.<br>
<br>
I've found sometimes it's better to root the wurms and nuke from the max distance than to let them come to you snared while you're casting that 6 second nuke.<br>
<br>
Ancient Shardwurms have way too much HP to kill solo.  <br>
<br>
Overall, the only reason to hunt Shardwurms now is they give xp and have very good drops that include spells and armor.  You'll want to hunt them for the loot with the xp as a bonus.<br>
<br>
For pure xp, go to EW.  For the best cash and xp combo, hunt Ulthorks.  For pure xp, walruses and rhinos, depending on your level.<br>

In fact, my entire guild has gotten rather tired of me complaining about them by now I imagine <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But you can do all of 45 in a day easy there once  you take care of the caster problem.  I see it as investing a bit of time to make the rest of my time that day worth so much more.  Once the spawns are setup the way I like, the zone is cake.<br>
<br>
As for the Rhino's, it's not easy to quad them, but it can be done.  Hmm..., I may have had clarity when I did it, which would have given me prolly close to 1/2 a blue bub (or more) of mana regen during the time it took to AE them into run mode, which would give me an extra DD for one of them.  Even though they are annoying to finish, I'm thinking they may be the best thing to quad at lvl 48, and when you clear them out, more ulthork warriors should spawn (usually not enough of these around to quad I find).  I also promised a guild-mate to teach him how to quad there (lvl 35), so I can get him to clear out the walruses, should be good hunting all around <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you're wondering, I use ... can't remember name, fire-based DD for about 250 dam as my finishing up nuke.  I keep conflag up as well for the odd one that has a lot of HP left while in run mode, or when something goes wrong and I have to single-kite something.  My flux tends to wear off while I'm kiting, so when nuking at the end I make sure to re-flux things then (don't matter mid-kite as CoF is magic-based, but I can see it causing me problems when I get PoF, will have to speed up my pulling somehow.) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20>AE Kiting</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
