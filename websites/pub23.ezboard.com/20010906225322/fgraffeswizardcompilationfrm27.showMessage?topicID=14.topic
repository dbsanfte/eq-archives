Hi all.<br>
<br>
Ennder here. However, I've taken a break from the carebare life and currently have a 12 wiz on Sullon Zek. Boy is it fun!<br>
<br>
I'm totally new to PvP. I was wondering if you could all brainstorm and tell me all the tricks of the trade. Good...Bad...and Ugly!<br>
<br>
I mean little things that PvP'ers do by nature that I wouldn't even think of...like certain hot keys, tactics ( water fighting), and others. Nothing is too small. I am a sponge that wants to suck up all your PvP experiences.<br>
<br>
Also, I have a few questions.<br>
<br>
1. are DoT's nerfed in damage like our DD's. It seems like they are not.<br>
<br>
2. Cancel Magic- will it cancel out magic based DoT's? or poison/disease?<br>
<br>
3. Pumice- see Question 2<br>
<br>
Anything at all will help. And I thank you all in advance for your help. I hope to bring honor to the Wizard class ( and kill lots of little doggies in the process)<br>
<br>
<br>

Honestly wizards kinda suck until our 20's (we get a nice boost at 29 with Yonder).<br>
<br>
In my opinion, pre 20's PvP is just random bullsh*t.  Lucky nukes, etc.  No real skill.  This isn't ENTIRELY true, but we just don't really start coming into our own until our 40's (44 to be exact).<br>
<br>
Low hit points, sucky ass DD's (compared to hit points/mana etc) - I remember the low level PvP as being more root/nuke and pray kinda deal lol.  A few shadowsteps/steelskins etc, but again you have like what?  250 hit points at level 12?  <br>
<br>
And at that level nobody has resist gear (at least nothing to write home about).  So there are just so many factors that just don't even get put in the equation that Pre-30 PvP is like kindergarten.  At 29 tho it gets really fun.  Yonder, snare, ports - things start looking up for us.  Becomes &quot;interesting&quot;.<br>
<br>
Could be wrong tho - it's been like 16 months <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anywayz some natural things - ya water is a good cover becuz they need a line of sight for spells - so if they are on land and u duck underwater they lose the line of sight.  Goes both ways tho.<br>
<br>
One thing I Can remember about low level PvP was that swimming skill was like uber hehe.  I used to do most of my teen-20s PvP in South Karana and darks would alwayz be swimming in the water to get away.  Ugh, it sucked.  Did my 30's in Kedge tho so maxed out my swimming and have been thankful many times in PvP becuz of that.<br>
<br>
Hmmm what else.  Lower level PvP isn't much to brag about really.  No timing involved.  No &quot;interrupts&quot; to mix in etc.  Everything casts so fast u dont have time to.  Your spells are pretty basic at that level which makes the PvP pretty basic.<br>
<br>
In regards to your cancel magic - it only works on magic based spells. <br>
<br>
And think of pumice as melee cancel magics.<br>
<br>
I used to carry pumice with me back in the day before they got nerfed.  (Used to be 5 charges insta-click and cast type deal).  Heh I can remember finding a dark and just goin click click click click click on that pumice to debuff the hell outta them in 3 seconds hehe.  But now it has a cast time sooooo that sux.<br>
<br>
Ummm let's see.  Basically at level 12, your only options are to root/nuke people.  Which is viable becuz on SZ, a new server, people aren't twinked just yet so their MR is prolly real sucky.  I didn't bother with PvP too much really until I hit 24.  Cuz our nuke at lvl 20 sux ass (it's an all or nothing nuke) but at 24 we get a nice one.  <br>
<br>
At 16 we get a LOT of nice spells (well for the level anywayz).  Invis, Bind Sight (I think), Heat Sight (for us hummies thats sweet),  Flamestrike (isnt that the DD at 16?? hmmmm I remember it being Fire Based)... <br>
<br>
Best advice I can give ya is to just do it.  Not to sound like Nike, but the best way to learn is by watching your opponents.  Remember the spells they cast, what they do, what they look like when they start casting, etc.  It will help.<br>
<br>
If you keep dying to a particular class find out why and resolve the problem.  If you consistently kill a particular class very easily find out why, and if u can apply this to other PvP situations.  <br>
<br>
Trial and Error is the best way to go becuz many people have varied preferences and PvP styles.  I like to sit there and go toe to toe with most of my opponents simply becuz I have the resists to do it.<br>
<br>
At 52 I stood toe to toe with a 52 monk in Uguk stuck in  passage and killed him.  3.0 sec spell Draught of Fire - I knew I could channel thru his hits and I did.   Bards I can channel thru usually as well.  Rogues ehhhh....usually not - plus I don't feel like them slipping a BS in.  <br>
<br>
However most wizards will yonder away etc and fight like that.  You just need to find your &quot;style&quot; and work on it.<br>
<br>
One good thing is at 16 we get Leatherskin - basically a damage absorber.  Nice trick is to Yonder, re-apply, then re-engage.  Pisses off most people <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One thing I will say tho is that PvP at those levels is FUN!  In the 44+ level range, most people become driven by loot and XP, so PvP becomes an occasional hobby or something.<br>
<br>
But pre-30 you just don't really care - you just play to have fun and that's what made the PvP back then so kewl.<br>
<br>
You didnt really give a rats ass about dying to a mob in PvP becuz it took like 10 minutes to get the XP back, and thats even if u didnt get a rez.<br>
<br>
But now, even with rez, u lose like 30 mins MINIMUM.  So u take less chances etc.  <br>
<br>
Anywayz, I'm rambling now, hope this helped some.<br>
<br>
Go read my other thread - it may answer some more of your questions.<br>
