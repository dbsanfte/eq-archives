Hmmm, just off the top of my head:<br>
 Kate Bush, Joan Armatrading, Tanita Tikaram, Janis Joplin, Melanie Safka, Janis Ian, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Stevie Nicks, Suzanne Vega, Melissa Etheridge, Nina Gordon/Louise Post, Björk, Cyndi Lauper, Juliana Hatfield, Lisa Loeb, Tanya Donnelly, Merrill Bainbridge, Tracy Chapman.<br>
<br>
As mentioned earlier Metallica hasn't done anything good since &quot;nothing else matters&quot;, and I'm not sure they will. They seem to gone ultragreedy and jumped into &quot;stuff the music, lets make as much money as we can&quot; mode, and just play off their name.<br>
<br>
I don't really get Tool.  They seem to be very <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> pop</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->ular, but then so were the (ick)Bay City Rollers, (ick)Culture Club, and (yucko)Air Supply (ptooi), and Abba and the Osmonds in their day.<br>

<br>
The argument was for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> strong</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> female SOLO artists- so we can eliminate all but Janis Joplin, Melissa Etheridge, and Bjork.  Melissa Etheridge will not be remembered in 10 years.  Bjork will be remembered but merely because she was different.  Nina Gordon/Louise Post died with Veruca Salt.  Lisa Loeb had a catchy single and died from the public eye.  Same with Tracy Chapman.  Cyndi Lauper... owes most of her success to the industry and cocaine in the 80's.<br>
<br>
Tool lacks the bubblegum qualities of pop bands- you may have lumped them in that category because radio stations play the same single on the radio every half hour for 3 months and it becomes very familiar.  Pick up Lateralus, SERIOUSLY listen to it twice through, and come back here and tell me you think the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukathatlafv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>KathatlaFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/13/02 9:50:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Music</span><hr size=1> Don't really like rock, or metal...<br>

<br>
 This thread is hard to decipher what some think makes a good band, is it the amount of records sold, amount of hit singles, longivity, breakthroughs, or talent of the band?<br>
<br>
 I am big fan of acid rock, band talent and creavity on stage, Im really surprised no one hase mentioned the Grateful Dead, and Phish. Neither bands are mainstream so you have to search for the music but both have proven they can produce good music for 2 decades, and the creavity during a live show the pure talent of the bands. Martin, Madeski and Wood have a lot of promise time will tell.<br>
<br>
 Some of the bands listed have great records but a live show is very rehearsed, rehashed from the night before, and in some cases lip sycned. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucorwwyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Corwwyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/13/02 11:43:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=92>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Music</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Anyone remember BEFORE Alanis Morissette (the first artist to take Liz's blueprint and run with it) how few women were singers in their own right, and how few wrote their own lyrics?

Those I listed were just off the top of my head.  There's also Sinead O'Connor, Hazel O'Connor(no relation), Nina Hagen, Patti Smith, Grace Jones, Toyah Willcoc, heck maybe even Suzi Quatro.<br>
<br>
What I'm saying is that I can think of heaps who wrote their own lyrics.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The argument was for strong female SOLO artists<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hmmm, That was a separate, yet mingled point in with women who wrote their own lyrics. Trying to answer all points with a combined list of examples, not all will fit all points.<br>
<br>
What do you mean by <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> strong</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> so we can eliminate all but Janis Joplin, Melissa Etheridge, and Bjork.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ummm, why eliminate those?  I guess I'll know when you let me know what you mean by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> strong</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Kate Bush's first 5 albums (and singles throughout that time) were all outside the studio mould, and a lot of her stuff will be remembered long after other artists are dust (who'd ever have thought Wuthering Heights would be a no.1 smash...).  <br>
<br>
You may be right about Nina Gordon and Louise Post. They certainly had a magic together that neither has yet realized solo, and also, Whiz's post was about solo performers.<br>
<br>
Lisa Loeb had a no.1 single with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Stay(I Missed You)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> back in 1994, and vanished from the public eye because she didn't have an album or followup release for a couple of years. Since 1996 though, she has had several charting songs (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I Do</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, for example was a top 10)...just without all the hype.<br>
<br>
Suzanne Vega is also a unique artist, with a minimalist approach, yet significant chart success and some unlikely winners (Tom's Diner, Luka, etc.) along with some more mainstream songs. Many kids will know the tune to Tom's Diner without having a clue who it was by.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Liz Phair didn't even enter the music market before 1992 (and her first recordings were 1991), whereas Tori Amos' first release was in 1980! (For the record Tori's first release was Baltimore/Walking With You.)<br>
<br>
So it's actually more accurate to say that Liz is singing in Tori's style rather than visa versa.<br>

Tori had 12 years to inspire a wave of female artists, and during that time we had ... well, we had Madonna, who will get her own chapter in the history of music, but who is almost certainly 100 percent non-affected by Tori.<br>
<br>
Now, you get &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; and then, in short order, you get Don Was, as I recall, repackaging former Canadian Tiffany Alanis Morrisette into an over-produced version of Liz -- even redoing her first single to make it more angry and bitter a la &quot;Fuck and Run&quot; -- followed by whatsherface with the single &quot;Black Velvet,&quot; the other whatsherface with &quot;Bitch&quot; and countless others. Suddenly, more than a decade after Tori, it's suddenly OK for women to A) have sexual urges that don't coincide with the wank fantasies of rocker boys and B) to tell guys to shove it up their ass if they don't like it.<br>
<br>
Yes, there were strong women before Liz, but maybe it was the American culture, maybe it was just the music biz, but the strong women didn't send out ripples that lead to anything. Yet the moment Liz does, suddenly, stuff starts to happen. Hell, I would go as far as saying that there would be no Pink, of all people, if there hadn't been a Liz. I guarantee you her producers and ghost songwriters own copies of &quot;Exile in Guyville,&quot; &quot;Whip-Smart,&quot; &quot;Juvenalia&quot; and &quot;whitechocolatespaceegg&quot; if Pink herself doesn't.<br>
<br>
Now, SHOULD previous artists have had that impact? You bet. But, for whatever reason, they didn't. And thus Liz, IMO, gets the credit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucorwwyn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Corwwyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/14/02 4:32:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Music</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Pick up Lateralus, SERIOUSLY listen to it twice through, and come back here and tell me you think the same.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Took up your suggestion, and just finished second listen to Lateralus(the album).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Grudge</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Reflection</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> seem the most listenable, yet even <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Grudge</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is spoiled somewhat by psuedometallica thrash guitar and voice thrown in.<br>
<br>
Disappointing, as I did hear a lot of potential on a few of the songs, (and I did like the 8 min or so format of many of the songs) but they just kept stuffing it up with commercial thrash.<br>
<br>
A shame, as the singer has a pretty decent voice, and the band can actually play...ummm, when they choose to.<br>
<br>
I think the only song completely free of that was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Reflection</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, but there they sing rather off key and out of tune, heh.  Somehow it still seems to work though (/boggle).<br>
<br>
Last, and least, track 12 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Triad</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->...htf did that get on the album. Felt like fingernails on a blackboard listening to that.  Brr r rrrr rr.<br>

It also feels somehow... I think the word I'm looking for is dead.  Albums like &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; were bursting with life; and while raw and unrefined, it's not like &quot;Morning View&quot;, which has a very over-polished feel to it.  I tried my hardest to find something to like about &quot;Morning View&quot;, but it seemed VERY overproduced.  Being popular's never been much of a factor in how much I pay attention to bands; I've LONG (ages ago) given up on MTV and haven't listened to the radio in about a year.<br>
<br>
A Perfect Circle was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> created by Maynard James Keenen; the band was formed more than 10 years before they released &quot;Mer De Noms&quot;.  Originally their plan was to have a female vocalist, but the story goes that Maynard heard the music they layed down and offerred his voice.  There are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> very</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> few rock bands, and even fewer successful rock bands, that use classical instruments aside from the violin; off of the top of my head I can pick off a clarinet, cello, flute and violin off of the album.<br>
<br>
Haven't had a chance to listen to Korn's new album, but their previous 2 releases have disappointed me so much I have little interest in it.  System of a Down is good, but VERY raw.  I think they'll be absolutely incredible in a few years.<br>
<br>
The problem with your analysis of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Lateralus</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> album was that you treated the songs individually.  As a whole, the album is stronger than any of its individual pieces; the music flows together with itself very nicely.  The guitar licks and transitions are fairly impressive as well.  And I'm curious as to what you mean by &quot;real&quot; offering by Tool (taerendur)- the influence of APC on &quot;Lateralus&quot; is very pronounced- you can't say Lateralus sounds at all like Aenema or Undertow, but I think it's a better album. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uclaudshadowflare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ClaudShadowflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/14/02 9:13:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.the-commune.com/forum/images/avatars/40.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Music</span><hr size=1> Oh, and a couple of points I missed in my last posts-<br>
<br>
Tori Amos is an absolutely fantastic artist.  I can't say her music is the kind that appeals to me, but I recognize she has LOADS of talent.  And on two cross-points... have you heard the duets she did with Maynard James Keenan?  It's rare when you get 2 voices like that in the same room to work together.  Wow.<br>
<br>
And yes, Limp Bizkit is trash- Fred Dust is too busy trying to promote 2nd rate rap artists to produce anything higher quality than &quot;Three Dollar Bill Yall$&quot;, which was, at best, a sign that there might be promise in Limp Bizkit.  If you saw them live before they broke open with &quot;Faith&quot;, their show had 20x the energy their shows do today.  Last I saw of them was the series of free concerts they did after Napster paid them $2 million to do it- they performed behind a steel cage and me and my friends spent the whole time booing them and getting stoned.  I (no bullshit here) had a dream last night in which I got kidnapped and brought to a Limp Bizkit show in a high school gym.  A skinny black rapper opened the show, and when Fred came out half of the place left.  I went, bought a christmas tree, changed into my gym instructor uniform for Halloween, and then the mayor of San Francisco got killed by terrorists. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uscylth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scylth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/14/02 10:08:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=99>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Liz Phair</span><hr size=1> I have to admit that I have not heard of her, so I may indeed suck.

I still wouldn't say they're all that original though.  Awesome musicians, great music....but not forging new ground.<br>

Another early-90's favorite was Janes Addiction.  I remember when I first heard that, it just totally blew my mind.  That was around the days when Metallica was real popular.....  nothing sounded like Janes at the time.  It was like &quot;God, what is this $h^%t?!&quot;  hehe.  <br>
<br>
Suffice to say all rock bands, whether they originate out of this country or not...they wouldn't be where they are now without the support of American audiences.  What do you think?  Could even the Beatles have been where they are without the acceptance of the American audience?<br>

KISS is a good show band, but that's all they are.  VERY commercial.  Dave Matthews Band- while I don't like them very much, I respect that they have loads of talent, instumentalists more so than vocalist.  Bon Jovi had his heyday, but whatever crap he's putting out now is rapidly cancelling that out.  CCR was Canadian IIRC.  I have to give a lot of credit to Buddy Holly, Richie Valens, and the Big Bopper for being early pioneers of a genre to become known as rock.<br>

I'm kinda shocked no one's came out to slam my suggestion that Smashing Pumpkins' later work was different or potentially influential- seems every time I mention SP someone comes from the woodwork to slam them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulimdul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LimDul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/14/02 10:24:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lava.net/~toasty/pictures/limdul.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rock</span><hr size=1> I didn't know CCR was Canadian.

Smashing Pumpkins was ok. I wouldn't say they were particularly groundbreaking...but maybe I'm thinking of an impossible standard. There was only so long I could take of Corgan's whiney voice. Then again, I can only take so much of Les Claypool's voice before my ears burst.<br>
<br>
As for woman lead singers, there's a lot of them I respect. I resisted liking female rock artists like Alanis and Sheryl Crow; but after seeing them live, I was impressed by their musicianship. But IMO, Hole set you women back a few steps in the rock genre.  <br>
<br>
Here's a band that didn't succumb to commercialism (sp?)...Sonic Youth. I don't know if they particularly drove any movement, but they get my respect for playing things their own way.<br>
