Behind me was a lake, which the leader of the gathered army told us not to swim in. Most of the orders he was shouting I casually dismissed - I'd been to Growth enough to know what not to do. A melody filled the air and I looked up to see a bard come up, with a sylvan protector after her. The warriors rushed out to save the bard as I continued rolling the sprocket around, while my familiar watched the fight with little interest. At last I stood up, after being told to assist in the fight. Unleashing two blasts of the fabled Draught of Fire spell, I sat back down. The space around me began to warp and twist as the protector summoned me to him. I heard a distict thud as the protector pounded on my protective skin. Standing up with little concern of the fight raging on around me, I began to cast Steelskin again... and again... and again. As the protector fell to the ground lifeless, I stood with no noticable signs of damage, except for a slightly depleted jasper supply. Turning around, I walked back to the hill where another wizard sat scribbing on a piece of parchment. As the raid rested, the bard had told us that two more protectors were near Tunare's treehouse. Quite a distance indeed. As a debate began on what to do, the other wizard stood up and said, &quot;Then let us bring the protectors here.&quot; When asked how, he merely pointed to a gaint tree in a distance and others began to nod their heads. Then they began to ask who would do such a thing. The wizard said he would do it, and before an objection was made, he ran off. Shortly after, a shout was heard and a tree began to move. As the protectors grew near, the wizard gated to safety. When he gated, one of the protectors began to make his way back to the treehouse. I ran off to repeat the trick. Eventually, the last protector came within range of the camp and was killed as I gated to safety.<br><br>With all the protectors safely... disposed of, plans began for taking down Treah Greenroot. As the final prepartions began, there were shouts that Treah was incoming to the camp. All sense of organization vanished as the groups scattered backwards. I remained sitting, not concerned. I was alone in the camp. People were shouting at me to move or I would kill them all. As the great treant was about to trample over me, he vanished. The raiders began to rub their eyes, questioning if what they saw was real. As the groups of people returned, convinced it was safe, I stood up and walked over to a slope of a hill. When asked how I knew, I only told them that Growth was not always what it seemed. As I sat, meditating, I could hear the sound of arcane magic swirl in the air as clerics began to cast protective spells.<br><br>I awoke from meditation to see the battle had just began. The raiders were tense, wondering what would happen if they failed. I watched the fight for a few moments, before turning  my attention elsewhere. I began to search my belongings, looking for that accursed golem sprocket. Finding it, I pulled it out and began rolling it in the ground again. Several clerics began crying out that they were running out of mana. Sighing, I stood up and looked around for the other wizard. I could not see him, but I could hear the sound of an ice lure being casted. Taking a deep breath, I began focusing. Draught of Fire upon Draught of Fire erupted on Treah's wooden body. His screams of agony pierced the air and the warriors closed their eyes from the blinding light of the Draught, and continued to swing. As the blindling light cleared, Treah's body was on the ground. Before I managed to sit down again, his corpse was already being pillaged for magical items. Eventually, the raiders found a shaman breastplate, much to delight of several shamans present. The leader of the army gave several hours of break. Eventually, one of the bards arrived, reporting the trek up to the waterfall was cleared. Packing what few belongings we brought with us, we made out.<br><br>As the party ran over a hill, spirit of some sort met our advancement with hostility. As the battle erupted, two Protectors of Growth arrived to aid the spirit. After the short, but furious battle, it was decided that a temporary camp should be set up. I sat down, slightly exhausted from having to run. I knew I didn't bring enough batwings. As I sat down, a strange presence flooded into me. I jumped up and looked down to see what was left of the spirit. A tint inside caught my eyes and I plunged my fist in to see what it was. Whatever it was, it was heavy. After some effort, I pulled it out. I stared at the item, a breastplate, asking myself what it was. As I turned it over, a musical note caught my eye. A bard breastplate. I annouced my findings and there was rejoicing. Before it was determined which bard would get it, there was a cry from creature. A deep, hallow, wooden cry. A cry of a treant. My head spun around and there, laying siege to the battered and tired party was Rumbleroot. My eyes snapped open as I heard parts of Elvish escape from his wooden lips. He had called others to join him. A great swarm of insects came upon us, nibbling at our flesh. Above the unearthly roar of the insects, I heard one word: Gate. Not waiting for a confirmation, I and other magic users began to cast our gate spells. As the warriors fell, Rumbleroot charged me. His great fist swung at my chest.  As it impacted, I was thrown from the ground into the air. Infront of my eyes, a swirling magical storm of arcane energy began to encompass my body. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Just a little longer...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I thought as I tried to keep my concentration. Eventually, the space around me exploded into a twisting vertex of arcane energy as Rumbleroot's hand reached down for me. The area around me began to warp as the vertex encompassed me... as Rumbleroot's hand grabbed my robe. Then there was only darkness. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  So... this is what is to be dead...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>A loud crackle awoken me. I stared out at the blackness. Slowly, it began to fade away and I could make the horde of insects still clinging to my flesh. Space exploded around at me as I arrived at my bound spot. I had managed to channel the gate spell. Nearby, clerics were quickly treating wounds that insects inflicted... but the insects ate away just as quickly. There was something I had learned once about insects that druidic creatures summon... as the memory floated back to me, I opened my spell book and began flipping the pages carelessly. Eventually I found the spell I was looking for. Annul magic. I casted it on myself several times, before I was finally able to rid myself of the arcane magic Rumbleroot had set upon me to attract the swarm. With the magic gone, the insects quickly dispersed. I quickly treated the others - but ended up destroying all the protective magics that were guarding them before ridding them of the druidic magic. As I sat down, exhausted from the encounter, I felt my chest be dragged downwards. I looked and there, still grabbing onto my robe, was Rumbleroot's hand. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Serves him right... I hope a gaint leaf grows to replace it...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>I closed my eyes and fell asleep, ignoring the chatter of the clerics and few warriors who had used gate potions to escape.<br><br>-Ikeya <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uikeya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ikeya</A> at: 1/1/02 12:44:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usangriaignatius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sangria Ignatius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/2/02 11:26:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Treah and Rumbleroot of Growth</span><hr size=1> LoL sweet.

'a ranger breastplate' and the like may be accurate in game, but from a storytelling perspective it needs some explanation. What distinguishes an item that can only be worn by certain classes? Perhaps this breastplate is less massive than average, with wider openings for the arms, to permit easier use of the bow? or something?<br><br>Just my few coppers of input...
