Uhm I made my point very clear.  Someone called wizards &quot;critical&quot; to raids.  I can't imagine canceling ANY raids for lack of wizards, save hate, air, and gore/hoshkar if you are low on people.  My guild has 3 ex-60 bane wizards that completely stopped playing their wizards to play monks, and two lower 50s wizards that now play a warrior/monk.  There is no doubt my guild is the better for it.  Mainly because they pull for us though :P  Every single ex-60 bane wiz in my guild concluded that their monks contribute more to the raid than if they played their wizards, even when not pulling.  I would have been a 4th ex-60 wiz, but I play both of my characters simultaneously.<br>
<br>
Sure wizards are great on bane mobs.  Are wizards critical in killing them?  I don't think so.  My guild decided to value rogues and monks higher when we were recruiting because those two classes will help kill the &quot;trash&quot; faster, will perform better on non-bane mobs (usually), and don't eat from the guild fund for pdots.<br>
<br>
Isn't anyone else mad about the pdots?! :P<br>
<br>
Well thats the opinions/observations of my guild and myself anyway.  If you want to flame me for my opinions, be my guest.<br>
<br>
Edit: I reread my post and I feel I was a bit too harsh.  Wizards are upgraded in value since luclin.  10% more damage from crits alone, FT items stacking, nice new DDs, and wizards own the hell out of new luclin uber mobs with insane hp, easily beating rogues with regular DD.  Wizards hold their own on raids no problem.  Its just conventional exp groups I have problems with :P <p>Torrid BrightFlame

I'm kind of disappointed how much this thread has been de-railed. It's not about comparison with other casters. We are the baseline, we need to correlate with melee. Then adjust other casters around us, much as they did with the melee balancing.<br>
<br>
On Etnu's evaluation of DB/GB, I have to disagree. He contends that other nukes are as efficient - this is simply not true as banes land for full dmg with no resists. Other spells have lesser ratios, and I defy you to consume a mana bar without a reasonable percentage of partial and sometimes full resists.<br>
<br>
Bleh anyway as about the 5th wizard in my guild still needing DB its a sore point. Farming an 8 hour place holder spawn in a high traffic zone, with a guild that is trying to prevent others getting DB around is just cruel. Frankly I think they need to look at this again, its worse than the cleric epic in some ways as you can't camp it, and you have to drag a group or two over to clear the spawns every 8 hours. Then if myga pops, you have to scramble whilst 3 other guilds mobilise next to you to try and engage first. I'd rather camp ragefire...<br>

There were several other solutions implemented such as high level mobs being able to summon players and mobs requiring you to be in melee range to land spells. There was even adjustment of the level range several times to account for legit targets nukers could be fighting (mainly on raids.)  The resist cap is a cap on exploiting safe spots but does harm wizards in groups taking on tougher mobs.<br>
<br>
A case can certainly be made that now with all the twink gear the level limit on resists is to small and should be increased but it is unlikely to be eliminated.<br>

All in all when it comes down to it you have my signature and support.  We can only hope that these kind of numbers will make VI look a bit closer at the wizard issues and come up with a solution that we can all live with.

<br>
Compromise that is very easy to implement.  Make more spells like Ice Spear of the Solist.<br>
<br>
1200 damage/300mana but has a recast delay.  As every sorcerer know ice spear rocks and makes a 60 wizard considerably more valuable to a group.<br>
<br>
Then make spells like this with lower damge/lower mana across all levels.  You have your group nukes, you have fast burn nukes, you have AE's, rains, PB AE's (they change jylls, they die) and I think life would be better.<br>
<br>
You can increase the groupablity of a wizard across all levels, without making him burning destruction machine.  The concept of ice spear was wonderful.  I dont know about hard core numbers but this would seem logical.  You want to burn a mob into the ground you pay for it, but for contributing damage to a group this would be ideal.  This makes wizards more groupable.<br>
<br>
In my opinon, we should not match rogues in damage over time.  That is all they do besides pick a lock and sneak.  The difference is in the ease of twinkability in this class vice the relative untwinkability of a wizard.  (Wouldn't you love to hook up a newbie wizard with a vermillion orb)  Ports get us groups, not by desireability for evacs but for making groups.  I dont walk into velks and just get picked up, but if I pick up group members I usually get into groups.<br>
<br>
Rogues can not AE.  Dont know how you AE but my AE exp is just incredible.  They would have to be primal stupid twinked rogues in ideal circumstances to make as much exp as I do AE, and that includes the occasional greedy wipeout.<br>
<br>
I will admit getting to 60 totally sucks but it does make it that much more worth it.  I am baised due to being 60, but I am proud that I earned it.  Very few 60 twink wizards.  Keeping it tough adds value to being 60.<br>
<br>
The mob issue, make some like gore.  Lure resist AE slow.  This will force people to use some more magic user types in battles.  As far as ToV, I rack in more damage than everyone (rogue, DS stacked MT, monk), I dont enrage sucide, I can avoid AE's.<br>
<br>
For pre-60 I feel for you.  Long road ahead but it is worth it until then.  I personally dont want to see a bunch of twink wizards and when I usually see a lower level wizard I know it is usually not a twink (unless some guild made a TL slave)<br>
<br>
<br>
Pentagarn Manastorm<br>
Sorcerer/Overburner<br>
Royal Norrathian Guard<br>
The Tribunal Server<br>

Not wanting to talk too much about other classes, if they do this, make /pet hold an ability at level 1.  Sick of seeing rampant pets killing group members.  I am not thinking of the best ways to fix a class, just the easiest.<br>

<br>
I am Playing a 34 wizard at the moment and have noticed these issues even at this low of a level, I like my wizard. I like being able to port around and snare beastiees but when it comes to damage... well lets just say it is unsatasfying in the extreme. <br>
<br>
I understand a exp groups reluctance to have me in a party as a wizard after all I can't do the damage that a secondary tank can do, I don't have the buffs of a secondary buffer, so basically I am there for uhm emergencies? I don't like the fact that my beastlord can solo blues and blacks for 8 or 9 mobs then sit and med for 10 minutes then go back to it. While my wizzie goes oom after each pull of one mob. I am not a twinked wiz by any means (int 162) robe of advisor and temp flux staff being my most notable items. I am told my int isn't high enoug for quad kiting yet so i have to single pull em. I agree that reducing mana costs will enable us to spread damage around more effectivly, my ultimate feeling is that as a wiz my only way to due damage is through my nukes I don't have a pet. or a flashy powerfull weapon. Andi def don't like my only way of doing offensive damage being done in two or three swings by a warrior. (at this level anyway) (and i can only do that damage for four shots, five with chanter). <br>
<br>
Now to those who say that wiz are balanced.... WAKE UP!!!<br>
<br>
This class is most certainly not balanced this class should be doing the damage of a warrior over the long haul, why? Because we can't take the damage of a warrior, we can't heal like a cleric or tank heal like a shaman or speed and clarity like a chanter... Beastlord now too, dish damage like a monk and rouge and provide extra tanking like the mage and necro. Wizards only have three things to contribute to a party. The ability to run away, The abillity to snare stun, and the abillity to deal damage. Of these what is the reason for having us in a group nine out of ten times?.. Damage. Dealing damage is what groups want from us nine out of ten times, and we let them down. Because Verant has not enabled us to acheive our potential. I am level 34 i can now nuke for hum 306, hum my chanter was doing 250 at this level. 56 point diffrence in damage output and comes with clarity included. would you trade that 306 points per mob for another tank that i can speed? OH wait escape.. what about that. Well as the old saying goes the best defense is a good offense. Personally in all the normal exp groups I Have been in i have been evaced exactly... ONE TIME.  By a druid. (with a right click evac staff of some kind)<br>
<br>
I started as a chanter so i have maybe a unique look on this, true chanter nuke is all or nothing, but my perception of Chanter was man my nuke sucks, I wish i could be a wiz and really nuke... Uhm well er seems I was wrong. My chanter still has there buffing role in a group at least.<br>
<br>
At least i can be a Wiz and port<br>

Even though I disagree with Armok about his underlying assumptions and therefore his conclusions, his research seems thorough and well-presented.<br>
<br>
This is mainly in response to MiteBe, who listed 12 'roles' for characters in a 6 person group.  His list, to me, epitomizes what is wrong with the PERCEPTIONS of the wizard class, even by other wizards.<br>
<br>
He lists three roles that wizards are generally put into:<br>
Snarer<br>
Evacer<br>
Damage Dealer<br>
<br>
Wizards certainly can and do serve in all three of those roles, and sometimes they even do all three at once.<br>
<br>
And a high-level wizard with his epic and a Staff of Temperate Flux can be a very good puller.  Not as good as an FDer, but at least as good as any non-FD puller.<br>
<br>
But the biggest role that a wizard can and should play in a 6 person group is this:  &quot;the weapon of last resort.&quot;  We are the ones, MUCH more than any other class, even paladins with LoH, who can save a party's collective asses, when things start to go wrong.  This can be as simple as taking aggro from an enchanter having trouble with the mob(s) that had a nearby caster mob buff their MR just before being pulled, or similarly rescuing the cleric who has gotten aggro.  It can even apply to more complex situations such as just too many little mobs around for the enchanter to keep mezzed w/o going oom, just nuke 1-2 down to a crisp and problem solved.  Sure, you may be medding the rest of the fight and into the next one to recover your mana, but you just enabled the group to do something they could not have done w/o you, even a much higher sustained damage dealer can not do what you just did.<br>
<br>
This relates to what I keep trying bring home to my fellow wizards.  Wizards are about FOCUSED damage.  Timing is everything.  When to nuke light and keep a full mana pull for when it is needed.  When it is needed, how to burn quickly, non-stop to get the job done.  This is one reason why I regard the Staff of Temperate Flux and its proper use to be sign of a really good wizard.  Not the epic.  Even mages, our closest competitors, can not hold a candle to wizards in this kind of situation.  Why?  Its not because they are less efficient, they are.  And its not because they get resisted more, they do.  But the BIG thing is that they are SLOW!  And they do not have the Staff 0f Temperate Flux to let them skip most of the 2.25 sec recast delay.   Many mages have trouble squeezing off more than one nuke in a fight, not because they would run out of mana, but because by the time they wait for tanks to get aggro and then land their first nuke, the fight is OVER before the second nuke can get there.<br>
<br>
That fast damage gives wizards a certain flexibility and enormous power.  If you are not using that power, then you really are not being a wizard.<br>
<br>
OTOH, I do agree completely that ALL casters have been getting the shaft and the disparity keeps growing with every expansion.  Luclin was supposed to be the expansion for casters.  I must admit that it seems that Verant got that PARTLY right.  The gulf between melees and casters did grow with Luclin, in my opinion.  But the amount by which it grew is less than it was for Kunark or Velious.<br>
<br>
That does need to be addressed, but I do not see that as a wizard issue, I see it as an issue for all casters. <p>Yugy of the Nexus</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/9/02 11:38:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=175>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> Hehe.. in my experience wizards can split mobs by really dying instead of just faking it.<br>

What makes you think a tank cant walk up to them and then beat them to death? And the damage diffrence between a wizard casting dd spells nonstop and a melee isnt as great as could be wished for. There is the added risk of root breaking and aggro making it mostly an advantage where there is room to snare and run. There is also no less then 6 classes with snare. Snare is usefull, and there are some other spells as well that are somewhat usefull. But other classes has other utilities as usefull or more so. So when it comes down to comparing a wizard to other potential group members so are damage the main thing, and that is somewhat lacking at many levels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvoldrak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Voldrak </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/10/02 1:32:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=177>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> IMO, Wizards are perfect on the dmg table wise. We dont need any increases there. Where we need something is in the utility spell section to make us more profitable to a group. Damage is all good,but lots of class can provide dmg to some point as well as other nice abilities. A mage can do decent dmg, but can also CoH peoples around etc.<br>
<br>
To make us more group profitable, wed need to have buffs or something. Well they simply need to change how the coding of one simple line of spells we have.<br>
<br>
The Okeils line of spells should not be a dmg shield, but a dmg add-on.<br>
<br>
You see more and more weapons that are now, lets say, 10dmg 20dly AND with something called: <br>
+1 fire dmg.<br>
<br>
Okeils should have been working like that from the start. For a small amount of mana, give the ability to melee to raise their average dmg by the number Okeil provides. Make them unstackable, where as the highest level one takes priority and well have a nice new group ability to help increase the damage output of a group overtime and a nice raid ability as well. <p>Voldrak Lightbringer<br>

This thread was moved by a mystery moderator to the class balance forum... which is probably where it belongs. Traffic on the general forum had dropped off quite a bit in the last couple days of it's residence there, and most of the posts were discussion of peripheral issues rather than the document anyway. I support the move to this forum.<br>

It has been a bit over a week since Scott forwarded the document to the live team. In order to not overwhelm the team with update requests, I'll ping Scott every other week with status. What that mean is that I don't have any status right now, but I'll ask next week <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samadhi BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Censor !!!</font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/11/02 10:13:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=179>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> I think it was Rombus.

I would like to comment on the addition of the new level 60 ice spell on test (1200 dmg for 350 mana) which is a 17% cost reduction. This is pure speculation on my part, but it may be the first of a line of more efficient DDs for wizards, which is precisely what I suggested as a key part of the remedy.<br>
<br>
Edit: More likely, this spell on test will never go live, and is put in to test the results of lowering mana cost of wizard spells. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarmok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armok</A> at: 2/13/02 11:13:40 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a> <b>9</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=201&stop=204>11</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=648.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=648.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=182><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=648.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=648.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=648.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=648.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
