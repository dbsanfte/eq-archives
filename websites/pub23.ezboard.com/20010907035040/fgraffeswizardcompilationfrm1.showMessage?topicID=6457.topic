Good reveiw or comparison to EQ.<br>
<br>
by Torred<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I am in on the DAoC Beta, just thought I would give my honest evaluation for anyone approaching the end of there time with EQ(like me).<br>
Just want to open up by saying that I have enjoyed EQ since beta, and I still think it is a good game. Having said that I have personally grown tired of it.<br>
<br>
I will do a comparitve evaluation of DAoC and EQ.<br>
<br>
Stability: This kind of seems like a large issue right now with the fiasco surronding AO, and the many people remembering EQ's early days. DAoC is 90% as stable as present day EQ, there is VERY little in the way of bugs and that I will give the mythic crew they have obviously written an EXTREMELY solid piece of code. EQ I consider to be the on the leading edge of stability in MMORPG, there are a few problems every now and then but for the most part can be counted on to be up 98% of the time.<br>
<br>
Everquest 9.5<br>
DAoC 9.0 (beta 4)<br>
<br>
Look: DAoC is the next generation of MMORPG, the look is there. The mountians are better, the sky is better, the water is better. SoL (shadows of lucian) will probably be comparable(but the minimum system requirments seem to suggest that SoL will not be a well made product as far as product-power ratio).<br>
<br>
Everquest 8<br>
Shadows of Lucian 9(based off of current screen shots in my opinion)<br>
DAoC 9.5<br>
<br>
Combat System: The combat systems are somewhat similar, there is the basic structure of tanks-healers-crowd contrl in DAoC just as there is in EQ. Although DAoC is somewhat more dynamic right off the bat, I really would only give a slight edge at this point. It should however be noted that DAoC combat is FASTER and far more hectic, it feels more like battle. Overall I had hoped for a bigger improvment over EQ but in the end it is an improvment.<br>
<br>
Everquest 6<br>
DAoC 7.5<br>
<br>
Magic System: This is DAoC's big hole, as far as I can see. There magic system sucks, it is not balanced in the least and is completely uninteresting. I never thought I would see the day when someone would reduce spell casters to the point where they were LESS interesting by far then melee based characters. One word ugly. I don't paticularily like EQ's magic system but DAoC's isn't as good.<br>
<br>
Everquest 7<br>
DAoC 3<br>
<br>
Sound: Not even in the same league, DAoC is 2000 tech lvl sound compared to EQ's 1990 tech level sound. If sound is a big thing to you then DAoC has it all over EQ.<br>
<br>
Everquest 4<br>
DAoC 8<br>
<br>
PVP: This is a rather tricky topic, PVP is really not something that turns my crank, I am no Quaker, just holds not interest for me. Having said that DAoC has the first PVP system I have seen that I have even CONSIDERED taking a part in. I don't consider EQ to be a PVP game so I can't really compare here. DAoC has a Realm based PVP system which means you can't PVP within your own realm. So you can litterally spend your entire time in a non-pvp enviorment.<br>
<br>
Everquest 2 (I don't consider everquest a PVP game)<br>
DAoC 9 (The only PVP I have ever seen that i find at all interesting)<br>
<br>
System Requirments: I really should mention the system requirments at this point, as givin to me a Pentium 266 is the listed minimum, and I can tell you right now that is WAY to low. When I saw that I pulled out my old PII 400, and I consider it unplayable at that speed. Currently at peek on the test server you see 750 people on and it gets chunky in the city with a PII 400. Since my game systems are so much more powerful I can't really say wht the minimum should be but I would guess somewhere around PIII 550 or 600 would be about right?<br>
<br>
Rating strictly for bang-for-your-buck power usage:<br>
<br>
EQ Currently 8<br>
DAoC 9<br>
SoL 6 (based upon what I have seen, and the nature of the product)<br>
<br>
Races: if you could be any race in DAoC in any realm I would say that DAoC would be a winner here. I think that both games did ok with races, nothing spectacular but passable. However I must say I hate the SoL models I have seen. Hair color/style/Facial features and height are somewhat adjustable in DAoC not AO but better then EQ. I do like EQ's classical fantasy slant and I do enjoy the roman philosophy in SOME of the races creation. I like the fat ogres basically. In the end a saw for me.<br>
<br>
Everquest 7<br>
DAoC 7<br>
<br>
Classes: I am not personally a big fan of the purely class based system, personally I think a mixed class/point system is the best by some distance. DAoC has such a system, and although not the best implementation of the system I have seen it is a far sight better then EQ in this. Having said that being limited in which classes you can be depending upon which realm you are in sucks, if you could be any class or race in any realm the game would be far more entertaining, this situation would simply make a EQ-style game that is simply better hands down in virtually every way. EQ has many class problems balance and otherwise I consider it to be both EQ's strongest and weakest point.<br>
<br>
Everquest 7<br>
DAoC 8.5<br>
<br>
Overall gameplay: DAoC has a very different feel then does EQ, I don't know exactly what it is per say but it feels different. Based upon that alone I would suggest trying it. Which is better?, DAoC is the next generation of EQ, most of the code that I am sure VI wishes they could have gone back and impelented from the begining(such as warrens loot) are present in DAoC in some form or another. One substantial difference that should be noted is the shift in phat lewtz philosophy, in EQ Dropped lewt &gt; Quested lewt &gt; character created lewt, in DAoC it seems at least Quested lewt &gt; manufactured lewt &gt;= dropped lewt.<br>
<br>
Overall Rating<br>
Everquest 8<br>
DAoC 9<br>
<br>
DAoC is not a game worth leaving your friends for(which game is) but if you and some of your closest friends are looking for a fun place to go DAoC does look like an improvment upon EQ in most areas.<br>

I just have one thing to say about DAoC, AO, and whatever else is coming out.  I'm no expert about the newer games, so take it with a grain of salt...<br>
<br>
My premonition is that the MMORPG scene will unfold just like the FPS scene, which I think was the last cutting edge gaming explosion in the evolution of things (and brought us the 3d engine feel eq has today).  And we all know how FPS games went.  Id was the pioneer, and they owned the scene for at least 2-3 generations (wolfenstein, doom, quake, quake2... some would argue quake3 as well, but other wouldn't, so there goes total dominance).  Now that the FPS scene has matured over a few generations, now other companies are comparable.<br>
<br>
I see the Current Everquest + Kunark + Velious kinda like wolfenstein, doom, quake1, and some of quake 2.  SoL will lie around the q2/q3 stage of the comparison.  It won't be until after the DAoC/AO/SoL competition... the next generation after... that other companies actually compete for real with the original leader.  Nobody can tell at this point, everything is unreleased beta and MMORPG are very hard to tell until a real community is in place... but this is my guess...<br>
