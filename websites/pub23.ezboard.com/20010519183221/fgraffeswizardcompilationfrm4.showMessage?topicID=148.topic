Wizards, I just wanted to post my thoughts here.  I play wizard, so I already know I’m not having as much fun as I should.  If you do play wizard, and have fun, I’m truly glad and I say “good for you.”  I do however believe you are in the minority.<br>
<br>
The VisionTM:<br>
<br>
1. Verant created a game where people pay money to have fun; If the game wasn’t, on balance, ‘fun” - a person would not play. <br>
2. Verant is a business which generates revenue from the receipt of fees charged to persons for access to the game, and these fees are paid on a monthly basis.  People have a right to make money in this world. And whatever else may be said, Verant has put out a fine product with tremendous entertainment value.   But see #1 and understand that a frustrated EQ client will be a nonpaying civilian soon enough.<br>
3. Leveling any character to say 50+, allowing for various skills of the individual playing that character, is still a long and arduous process (no PL);  This serves several functions, including pride in accomplishment and satisfaction of the player (see #1), but also supports #2 quite nicely.   “Money, is gooooood.”<br>
4. Verant created many classes, in theory balancing them all to assure that grouping would offer advantages over soloing.  Grouping supports the multi-player environment, and distinguishes the game from first person games, strategy games  and most shooters.  This gives birth to the first tenet of the Vision:  “Grouping is goooooood.”<br>
5. At character selection, not many of us knew what playing that character at 50 would be like.  We based our decision on various descriptions of the game, the classes, our experience at lower levels, and by observing higher level players, etc.  <br>
6. Few character classes are played in the same way, or are as effective in the same manner, throughout their lifespans – so a player’s assumptions in #5 above were doomed to be pretty unreliable;  Even Vernat didn’t know what the post-50 gaming experience on a full server was going to be like;<br>
7. Verant routinely identifies spells/abilities/weapons/proc’s which are, or could be, unbalancing (see #4).  Lack of balance, in Verant’s Vision, does not support grouping (for example an “uber” class who never NEEDs to group or one class which levels dramatically faster than another), and so lack of balance violates #4.  So this becomes the Second tenet of Verantism:  “Balance is goooood.”<br>
8. As a subset of balance, Verant actively supports a concept of risk versus reward.  The purpose of RvR is to insure proportionality, and is built into the code (so a level 50 cant level off of shadow wolves, good loot is typically well-guarded, death brings a bigger penalty to xp as a character matures, etc., etc.).   See #7.<br>
9. Verant makes ongoing changes to the game to ensure #1, #2 and #7 (and therefore #<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   are satisfied at all times.  Sure, it is a subjective process, but they do what they can for the most part.<br>
10. Players become attached to their characters, both through active customization, recognition of their persona/avatar by others in the game, and as representing vast amounts of invested time.  This is intended.  This is good.  It supports (see #1 and #2).<br>
<br>
So everybody is happy right?  Wrong. <br>
<br>
WizardRealityTM #1       As a post-50 wizard, it is hard to get into a group.   Why?  Let’s review four of the biggest inherent difficulties of the post-50 game.  I know there are many more - but these are the biggies:  1)  Mana regen is poor across all classes, and the amount of mana that higher level spells require is vast.  2) Stray MOBs and ADDs can kill weaker party members more quickly in high level hunts.  MOB management (a.k.a crowd control) is therefore critical.  3) RvR is no where as evident as in the death “penalty” post 50.  Over 50, death can erase days or even weeks of playtime.  4)  The vast amounts of experience needed to level means few will put up with group incapable of near continuous pulling, which requires constant damage-dealing.    <br>
<br>
Now all of these problems could add up to no fun, and as we saw above, fun = money.  But there is another way your money might not get to Verant’s pocket:  The game stays fun throughout, but it ends too quickly.  So the VisionTM depends upon you leveling slowly while searching for the next fix, be it a new level or item or whatever.    So rather than change the RvR structure, or mana regeneration rates, or MOB placement and experience tables (all of which are probably easy to code), Verant developed solutions to the above problems through a little creative imbalancing.  <br>
<br>
Now I know, I know, I claimed Verant fervently supports the “Balance is gooooood” tenet.  And they do.  But “creative imbalancing” was the only way to protect Vision #1 and #2 without making the end game too easy, so Balance was sacrificed very intentionally and selectively (more on this below).  <br>
<br>
So, enter our dear friends the enchanter (speeding mana recovery, and enabling crowd control), the bard (see enchanter), cleric (“Wow…you mean I died but there’s a spell that will give me almost ALL my experience back?  Can I get a “Hell Yeah!.”)  The massive damage MOBs can deal and constant party damage requirements have also given birth to the era of the meatshield.  Yes friends, that dopey little warrior and silly, pajama-wearing monk bugging you for ports and spamming the zone for trance sticks are now irreplaceable.   YOU however are easily replaced in any group. <br>
<br>
But what about nuking, you cry?  We are da mastahs, right?  Well, it seems we are the masters of single spell DD (kinda, sorta).  But damage over time and non-aggro damage win the EQ day.  Yeah, nuking is needed, but a druid can nuke almost as good, can buff and heal, same for shammies.  Necros can solve some mana problems (they are mana batteries on planes raids) and can add meatshields when you are short one.  They also are near constant damage dealers.  Same for magicians, who are basically portless wizards with awesome pets.   So there they are, the “B” team:  those classes which support the “stars.”  Like good bench players, they are not essential, but still desired.   Wizards do nothing that someone else can’t do in a group, and can’t do much of what is desired our of “B” teamers.<br>
<br>
Am I whining?  Nah.  Citing FACTs.  Disprove me Verant, I dare you.  Let Verant publish the amount of playtime logged by 50+ players, sorted by class.  Let them also publish the amount of time by solo, and then grouped.  Don’t think they have this ability?  Don’t kid yourself.  It isn’t hard to monitor and they should be doing it now, if not to spice up some memos to Sony about maximizing cashflow.  Spend less time sniffing out EQShow and more time doing market research like this to test your mighty Vision Balance.  Does anyone think Wizards aren’t going to be near the bottom of these lists?  Or are the class most often permanently /lfg?  <br>
<br>
WizardRealityTM #2.  Soloing is all we got 90% of the time (see WizardRealityTM #1), and we are “ok,” but not as good as others.  Remember “creative unbalancing”?  Notice Verant was VERY careful about this.  They didn’t want any of these unbalances (and let’s face it the class abilities mentioned above are awesome and VERY UNbalancing) to be SOLO friendly.  That would break the “Grouping is good” rule, which is the one they were trying to improve post-50 in the first place.   A chanter soloing has little need for mez and no direct way to become a soloing machine simply through using their own Clarity. A cleric won’t solo all the time simply because he can rez.   So if we wizzies were group-friendly (“B” team mind you – not a star), I wouldn’t care so much.  I didn’t pay all this money to solo all the damn time anyway, and hey, no one is supposed to solo easily, right? (see everything above).   <br>
<br>
Well OOPS!   So how do you explain druids? (a highly mobile and more resilient and self-healing wizard with DOTs and buffs) and a necro? (a multi-faceted killing machine who can heal himself, buff better and DOT for constant damage, and let’s not even calculate the damage over time and protection afforded by his boney friends).   Both can take down a 12,000 HP mob (say a Sentient Armor).  I can’t even get them to 1/3rd health.  Yet we could all be the same level.  What’s more, DOTs  and PETs decrease downtime.  Damage while medding?  HOW un-Vision!   Yet for wizards sitting on your ass all the time with no upside should be ok.  Especially while everyone else is soloing better MOBs (let’s not even talk about a Druid’s tracking) or group fighting in dungeons I’ve never even seen.    <br>
<br>
Is it any wonder druids and necros are a dime a dozen?  Isn’t this proof enough that we’re broken?    Wizard isn’t a challenge, it’s a broken part of the game we pay the same $10/month for.   Wizard’s should pay a reduced rate, because we get third class service. <br>
<br>
Don’t even tell me about how I should switch classes.  (see #3, #5, #6 and #7 under Vision). That’s why the class is so screwed up as of now.  Every wizard that quits gives Verant more credence to ignore us.  Face it brothers and sisters of the purest caster magic – we’ve dwindled to such a small number, I’m surprised we haven’t been patched out of existence.   <br>
<br>
So might Verant, what to do?   <br>
<br>
Fix us.  Make us group friendly again (assuming we ever were).   Much like what happened monks and rogues, you’ll see more newbie wizards running around if you do it right.  That will be your proof, the only proof.   Everything else is conjecture.<br>
<br>
Class balance.  I don’t know what you need to do to “fix” wizards, but ya know, that’s your fucking job Verant.  I already have a job, thanks.  And what part of my monthy fee goes to ongoing programming to keep the Vision alive?  Quatify it so I can get my damn money back.  I want a rebate.   And don’t point to Translocate, we should have gotten Call of The Hero.  Why should I give a shit that I can be forced to pay 3k pp to be a turnstile at the end of a three hour raid I can hardly participate in.  Harvest?  Yeah a third of a bubble of mana every once in a while.  Big deal.  Bonds of Force is the only thing keeping many of us not in Uber guilds alive.     <br>
<br>
I resent Verant making me into a whiney little wizard beggar at the gilded doors of EQ.   Just fix us, and stop the stupid insipid insulting holier-than-thou bullshit answers.  Or just delete the class - and give every account with a wizzie main a pre-rolled level 30 whatever in the class of the customer’s choice as compensation for beta testing an unrepairable bug.  Admit it, you can’t code the class right, and you won’t budge from your Vision.  So cancel us, it’s an embarrassment.<br>
<br>
Or do nothing.  And this seems to be where it all rests.  Well ok by me, because soon EQ won’t be the only game in town anymore - and you should stop acting like you are.  I’ve been beta-testing Dark Age of Camelot and let me tell you they have a ways to go, but you should be concerned Verant, very concerned.  And about Horizons and a few others to come.  Mythic is well aware of EQ’s shortcomings, and seems able to code around some of the stuff you simply can’t or won’t take the time to figure out (variable experience for unpopulated zones, individualized questing, better ways to deal with worldbuilding than creative unbalancing).   So sell your Shadows of Luclin, increase your polygon count and your new clients list.   Hopefully you won’t turn a deaf ear on them after two years like you have with wizards.   <br>
