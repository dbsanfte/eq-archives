Well, as seen in this log the rogue was running around alot with autoattack on and missed several rounds of attack due to that. It also shows where the rogue runs past the casting wizard, hittting backstab but missing the normal attacks due to bad timing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually I turned auto attack on when I apeared from my perspective to be in melee range.  Couldn't get attacks from some of those rounds thanks position lag.  Also sometimes you will miss a round of normal attacks circling for bs even if your good at it.  Attack round timer for me is 1.8 seconds and if you are off position in the .1 second that counts well ya miss a round.<br>
<br>
FYI if you didn't know which you apparantly don't you get a double msg when meleeing a runed target. Note...<br>
<br>
[Fri Apr 12 21:17:09 2002] You try to slash Voltaic, but Voltaic's magical skin absorbs the blow!<br>

[Fri Apr 12 21:17:09 2002] You try to slash Voltaic, but Voltaic's magical skin absorbs the blow!<br>
<br>
Since I only slash with my offhand and don't have triple attack let alone quadruple attack...I think you can see how that works.<br>
<br>
Point should be even when not chasing ghosts lag and hasted lures means not much time to smack around the wiz with no interuption to speak of while its on.  As far as not being able to yonder to reaply it...well shadowstep for my low sk and necro with only 3/5 the range seems to be almost a get out of jail free card in most outdoor zones just in and of itself although it can take a few tries, and this is even vs sowed targets.  You only need one good one.  You move while the recast dly is passing. It should be damn easy to back off enough to re-epic if you so desire.<br>
<br>
As far as backstab not being uses every second it pops up well sometimes your running around when it pops.  Sometimes it gets wasted with the bs &quot;too far away&quot; msg.  Sometimes the target turns and takes a stab instead. Sometimes your not in position for a bs when you catch up with them and in the 1/2 second it would take you to circle they take off.<br>
<br>
All skills have some limitations that keep you from doing totally optimal performance.  Including wizard spells and melee.  Melee is rather more subject to limitations than focused lure dds though...<br>
<br>
Are you offended by the idea that wizards are actually a good pvp class? Looking at the SZ top 20 I see...<br>
<br>
6 wizards<br>
8 druids<br>
3 necromancers<br>
1 ranger<br>
1 shadowknight<br>
1 rogue<br>
<br>
A more telling statistic that isn't shown would be the average points per member of a class in a given lvl range. Would love to have that info made available...<br>
<br>
See those stats?<br>
<br>
6 wizards<br>
8 druids<br>
3 necros<br>
<br>
Don't see any warriors or monks even represented at all do ya? Melee dmg is powerful but its pretty damn limited as far as actually getting kills or doing that dmg in pvp.<br>
<br>
Look at the classes that do show up and ask yourself why they do and why others don't.<br>
<br>
Sk disc ht (duh) makes it hard to just run around and kite and do hit and runs cause it owns people.<br>
<br>
Rogues have poisons vs people with poor PR and melee dmg.<br>
<br>
Rangers have ensnare.<br>
<br>
<br>
Monks given good gear have generally near as good or better pvp dmg than rogues via hard hitting 2handers and not needing to position themselves yet they don't show up. Why aren't they there? No way to make a caster hold still.<br>
<br>
No warriors despite their huge hp and bash.<br>
<br>
No pallys desite being impossible to kill with nukes with high end heals and LOH.  Root is too resistable.<br>
<br>
No Bards.  They kill too slow.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: Melees suck ass outdoors unless their target has restricted movement or is caught totally, utterly and stupidly offguard.  Even then the chance of finishing is not good.<br>
<br>
Indoors melees are good but subject to bs exploiting through walls especially by pet casters who can target zone wide via /pet attack /assist.<br>

Getting to the top list on Sullon Zek is all about running/porting around and killing people you find that are busy fighting a mob or simply low on health as alot of tactics not alowed on other pvp servers are used on Sullon Zek. The top 20 will be the the ones who spend the most time doing just that, and being moderatly good at it. Anyone who spends alot of time doing anything else then looking for new victims wont be on the list. Just killing people you randomly meet wont get you on any top list. The only thing this list realy shows is what class those who wants to do this prefers. Druids are the obvious answer with both ports and track. Even it had some meaning, then rogues are better in pvp then alot of classes and equal to rangers and shadowknights. The information gained from this statistics is far too insignificant to draw any of the conclusions you have. Just consider what if a rogue was now a position 21 and the 1 sk got out of the list. Then SK wouldnt even be in top 20 and rogues would be twize as 'good' as rangers. <br>
<br>

Interesting, why doesnt the log post say that you was suffering from lag then? This can easily be seen as a prime reason for any bad pvp result. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/16/02 5:00:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Those damn underpowered wizzies. *warning short log file</span><hr size=1> Znail, I don't know if you have ever pvped with a melee on a modem connection but it's really hard because you get a lot of ghosts, especially after people shadowstep.

<br>
FYI points are lost for deaths on SZ so that ranking is the people that are among the best at killing and avoiding death I'd have to assume.<br>
<br>
The number of melees in general on that list is to small to draw conclusions about relative position.  However the fact that all of the top end of the list and indeed almost the entire list is occupied by wizards, druids, and necromancers with the first 2 dominating the list and holding all the top end of it...does indeed mean something.<br>
<br>
The fact that the melees represented are all among those that have some method of effectively finishing the fight while those that don't lack representation seems to me to be relevant too.  If you don't think so I don't think I could put it any clearer.<br>
<br>
My point here hasn't been to say that rogues suck it  has simply been to put things in perspective.  Casters are not weak in pvp. All classes are stronger in differernt circumstances.  Wizards are by NO means weak in their element and in need of no sweeping across the board change other than a larger mannapool in some situations pvp wise.<br>
<br>
For all the supposed power of a warrior with hp such that a nuker doesn't have the mannapool to take him down there isn't a warrior on that list...<br>

I know this I went to SZ when it opened because most of my RZ friends had stopped playing (they were playing AO heh) but when they came back I returned to Rallos. FYI I was playing a warrior, because imo they are the best (read most useful) PvP class high end. Monks are pretty decent too.<br>
<br>
To answer you question: you get more or less 100 points when you kill someone in your level range and you lose 25 points when you die. You also get negative points if you kill someone 20 levels below you, or if you kill people many times in a short interval of time. The point system on SZ if fucked because of this:<br>
<br>
- a big points advantage for killing people<br>
- a small point advantage for dying<br>
- negative points also given when you kill someone out of range<br>
<br>
IMO there should be no negative points for killing peeps, and there should be a very harsh penalty for dying.<br>
<br>
The SZ point system gives a high advantage for people who kill a lot and die a lot, as opposed to people who never die: Never die, never kill you have 0 points. Kill a lot and die 2x more you get tons of points, thus I would not base my conclusions on classes that do not die in PVP based on SZ point table ranking.<br>

It means they kill a lot. You can't prove that they don't also die a lot by simply looking at the points.<br>

<br>
In SZ you get points for the kill. How often in regular XP groups do you see a wizard get the finishing blow? Quite often. Does that prove that the wizard does more damage than the rogue?<br>
<br>

<br>
Once again, don't die, but don't kill = no points. On SZ, I tood down Mezmoriah with my warrior when he was level 53 and me level 35 (solo). How many points for that? About 250. Take a level 40 druid to OT and kill the people XPing there for 50 pts per pop = lots of points.<br>
<br>
If you think that SZ pts system shows who are the great PvPers in this world you are wrong, and ask anyone about that on SZ and they will agree. SZ pts only shows (like everything in EQ) if you play A LOT. Play few, but play well and you'll be a nobody.<br>

<br>
No.  I was saying that if you in RL lived in a very wet environment you wouldn't remark much on the fact that it rained.  Some level of lag is a given on any type of connection because it takes a given amount of time for information to travel between your computer and the server and for info to travel back. This time is defined as lag.  I didn't say anything about lagging because the level of lag was no greater than normal.  Some noticable level of lag is very much the norm on dialup.<br>
<br>
To adress your next point let me go back to a few things you said.<br>
<br>
&quot;The point system on SZ if fucked because of this:<br>
- a big points advantage for killing people<br>
- a small point advantage(disadvantage I think you meant) for dying&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;IMO there should be no negative points for killing peeps, and there should be a very harsh penalty for dying.<br>
<br>
The SZ point system gives a high advantage for people who kill a lot and die a lot, as opposed to people who never die&quot;<br>
<br>
That makes a lot of sense there Aurore. In fact it even makes a lot of sense for RZ if you think about.  How many no drop wizards do we have that lose nothing in dying and gain hugely from the very same situation described above. Killing AND dying a lot.<br>
<br>
So whats shocking about wizards being on top of point gain and gain of loot on RZ?  Strong offense and weak defense like rogues.  Warriors with their huge hp have great defense but weak offense.  They don't die often but they wont be ahead point wise on SZ and much more importantly for the people on RZ thye will over time replace good gear lost to pvp with very little or nothing to show for it as far as pvp gains regardless of skill unless they chooses to gang bang pk with some casters. Is the grass really greener?<br>

<br>
That part made me laugh.  Ummmm My main hand is called an epic weapon.  It's called ragebringer...<br>
<br>
15dmg 25dly 100hp 20str 10 sta 10 agi 10 dex 20pr 20mr 10 dr The effect (worn) grants the wielder 40% haste (stacks with spells but not inate haste items) and 40atk.<br>
<br>
With 40% haste it is a 15 dmg 18 dly weapon. Thanx info.  What really makes me laugh is the fact that all the good stuff is low dly.  Lower than epic in fact. With delays generally ranging from 17-22. <br>
<br>
&quot;It doesnt mean offensive classes are generaly unbalanced. &quot; Did I say they were?  I said they were strong in their environments.<br>
<br>
The biggest thing pvp needs is for cheapo exploits and bs that real pvpers wouldn't touch allready to be nerfed without harming the legitimate tactics. Oh and to have certain AA skills get the hell out of the pvp environment.<br>
<br>
They then need to look at pvp intensely and fix some imbalances and ridiculousnous that effects all classes melee and casters included at different times and in different situtions.<br>
<br>
Then they need to look at the ridiculously broken item loot setup they have now and realize it is in need of major revision because skilless ganking, cheapness, and cowardice shouldn't be the best path to material gain (or point gain for that matter).  Its just bs.<br>
<br>
To claim that you need DT, exploits, or cheapness to pvp as any class is to bring grave doubts forward as to your competence as a pvper.  I would hope you would be in agreement with that.<br>

So the 25 delay weapon you had was a bit more what I expected then an 18 delay weapon, as most of those are pretty low damage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/02 6:08:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Pffffff</span><hr size=1> &quot;Ah, that explains it.

People and most people are the most cited sources of people that don't know shit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . FYI all the really good stuff has an unadjusted dly of 21 or lower.<br>
<br>
Vyremms fang 13 17<br>
Salendrilite(sp) dagger 13 18<br>
Massive heartwood thorn 15 21<br>
Mrylo dagger 15 19 <br>

Bloodbath 16 21<br>
<br>
To name a few<br>
<br>
&quot;I can figure out the effects of haste without help.&quot;<br>
<br>
You'd be suprised how many people even melees can't.  I kinda thought giving the actual adjusted dly showing precisely how fast I was hitting specificly once every 1.8 seconds was a useful way to put it.<br>
<br>
&quot;...and is mostly used by people that want to inflate their egos&quot;<br>
<br>
Excuse me, but how many people do you know that use the way they give weapon dly as a way to boost their ego?  Can you argue without just making shit up?<br>
<br>
Wizards have always been the favored pk class on RZ.  You've  never been the underpowered and under privileged step children of pvp.  You fit that image even less with focus items and AA.   If your concerned with twinks lvl up.<br>
<br>
People who spend their time in melee heavy exp grind groups think wizard dmg sucks.  People who do AE groups, quad kiting, and raiding have a different opinion do they not?<br>
<br>
People who don't play their wiz agressively, the kind of guys whose pvp vs melee experience consists of melees whacking them while their medding unawares and taking their lunch money think wizards suck in pvp.<br>

I wouldnt call one decent weapon with that delay many. And it would still be somewhat worse for pvp then epic. The rest of the list doesnt have anything to do with it at all (and I recognise all the rest), because close still isnt the same.<br>
<br>
Rogues have always been the favored pk class on RZ. You've never been the underpowered and under privileged step children of pvp. You fit that image even less with new weapons and disciplines. People who don't play their rogue agressively, the kind of guys whose pvp vs caster experience consists of casters nuking them while their wandering unawares and taking their lunch money think rogues suck in pvp.<br>

That makes a lot of sense there Aurore. In fact it even makes a lot of sense for RZ if you think about. How many no drop wizards do we have that lose nothing in dying and gain hugely from the very same situation described above. Killing AND dying a lot.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Practically all the PK wizards on RZ why? Everyone PVPs as they wish, I know that I do my best not to die, because that's what shows how good you are at PvP, and that's why I will gate / run if the situation is not to my advantage.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> So whats shocking about wizards being on top of point gain and gain of loot on RZ? Strong offense and weak defense like rogues. Warriors with their huge hp have great defense but weak offense. They don't die often but they wont be ahead point wise on SZ and much more importantly for the people on RZ thye will over time replace good gear lost to pvp with very little or nothing to show for it as far as pvp gains regardless of skill unless they chooses to gang bang pk with some casters. Is the grass really greener?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nope but if you just run around always in no drop gear then you won't lose anything, if that's your problem. The point is, if a wiz ran around with gear, he'd have lost it all pretty fast. That's why they run around with nothing, and get stuff when they kill people. Is it fair? No, but up to you to chose the way you want to PvP, be it by risking gear and having a slight advantage to using it, or by going no risk, and possibly losing some effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Are wiz the perfect PK-Ebay class? Yes I agree. Do wizards fit my view of balanced PvP, in so far as they have a chance against every class, no not at all. The PK-Ebay wizards are simply using the best tool for their ends (ie get loot off players regardless of the number of times they die themselves.<br>
<br>
This is quite a different discussion from the fact that wizards are good in PvP or not. I don't call dying 10 times and killing 1 monk and looting a fungus tunic a class balanced in PvP. I have my views on PvP; and Sullon is imo the best PvP server from the ruleset, because even if they are scoring points, those wiz are taking the deaths (albeit small with xp res but still) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ullyapakadeabn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llyap aka Deabn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/02 9:11:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pffffff</span><hr size=1> Aerimus wrote: &quot;Wizards have always been the favored pk class on RZ.&quot;<br>

Wizards are a favored pk class primarily because they can solo, and they can transport.  PvP class balance between skilled opponents hardly enters into it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/02 9:34:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Since when?</span><hr size=1> &quot;Rogues have always been the favored pk class on RZ. &quot;<br>
<br>
Since when? I know of exactly 1 non newbie pk rogue on RZ. You know what though?  He waited till upper 50s after good guilds helped him get good stuff to turn pk... <br>
<br>
Thought admittedly I have seen a bunch of uber twinked 20ish alts rogues pking if thats what you mean.  But I guess when you have gear 30 lvls above your actually lvl any melee becomes a god. A bunch of lvl 20s twink alts hardly makes rogues the pk class of norath...<br>
<br>
As far as wizards power vs skilled oponents what do you mean by that.  You mean you can't kill plate tanks and clerics because they have too many hp, that uber guilders kick your ass, or that you can't win a fair duel.  <br>
<br>
The first isn't all of pvp nor is the 2nd both demand their own precise solution not a blanket one, the last hardly matters.<br>
<br>
As far as there being no balance here well wizards are good at killing by suprise.  You might say that this is balanced by something of a disadvantage vs a prepared oponent.<br>
<br>
Any specific pvp problems that wizards may well face need to be described in detail and adressed by precise solutions.<br>
<br>
Which needs work there? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27>PVP Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
