It seems the zone wasnt fully popped, but I am not sure if this would have changed anything. The following are my observations and thoughts shared to help inform others:<br>
<br>
1) The zone was broken in the SE corner. Yes in the zone in building, but we all ran to the SE corner RIGHT AWAY. It appears that mobs are more likely to aggro around the zone in point then in the SE corner of the room.<br>
<br>
2) Everyone remained in the zone in buildings SE corner except the pulling team: Scout (rogue), FD puller (monk), Tagger (Warrior and main assist).<br>
<br>
3) The tagger pulled the mobs into the building and then we wasted them.<br>
<br>
4) The tanks worked the mob down to 70% to 80% health, and then the nukers vaporized them. Yes; because the pulls were so good even chanters helped blow mobs away.<br>
<br>
5) The raid consisted of 28 to start all in their 50s. My feeling is 4 teams, or 24 (all is their 50s) would be just as effective with less chance of causing unwanted adds.<br>
<br>
6) The main reason this worked is DISIPLINE!!! Everyone listened to the leader.<br>
<br>
7) The higher level chanter you can get the better! This is the most important class to have at high level for mezzing purposes.<br>
<br>
8 ) The Scout, Puller, Tagger team needs to work together like a well oiled machine.<br>
<br>
9) Raid leadership duties need to be delegated, so no one is overwhelmed with work. These are the positions I see and who should fill them: <br>
<br>
Raid Leader (The person willing to do this with the most experience and success) This person makes the command decisions which is the hardest job.<br>
<br>
Rosterman, who sets up the groups, and makes any changes to them (someone who the raid leader trusts to carry out this task, and who is not busy with buffing or in pulling crew).<br>
<br>
Lootmaster, who makes sure loot goes to the right person. This should be the only person asking for rolls and should send a direct tell to the person to loot the item they win. This person needs to have most of their attention on the loot calls and players rolls and should not be busy buffing or leading, or pulling. I suggest a mage, necro, or wizard because they med and blast mostly and are less busy then buffers and tanks.<br>
<br>
10) We are playing to have fun so occasion jokes in say or ooc are good, but try not to do it too much on muli-group raids. Spam can make things difficult.<br>
<br>
11) Chanters should stay in certain areas, spread out a bit from each other, to see the mobs for mezzing. Plus if someone is attacked by a mob that is not the one mainassist is attacking, this person can run the mob close the the chanter to mez.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well these are my thoughts. I am not telling you how to run a raid, just letting you in on my experience. I am not an expert, but I have been on a dozen planes raids and have led lower level raids.<br>

<br>
Ok<br>
So you are saying that you broke the zone in the SE corner of the zone in building not the SE corner of the zone.  There are a few strategies for breaking hate, some say zone in building some say SW corner and others say NE corner. The SW corner is what most of us have done in the past. I saw Elektra also refer to the SE corner and wasn't sure what she was talking about cause the SE corner of the zone in nothing but buildings close together and would seem to be a bad spot for a large group to fight without building aggro. <br>
<br>
As far as the Leadership postions you ideas are good.<br>
<br>

<br>
For example, at the last Fear raid:<br>
<br>
I organized, led it.<br>
Hareq lead tactics/master loot<br>
Telivak organized groups<br>

This needs to be done at every raid.  No one can do it theirselves.<br>

I was NOT condemming any raids we have done or how they were handled. I was NOT saying the SE corner of the zone in building (which is the SE corner of the zone) is the only or even the best place to break Hate. As far as splitting leadership jobs, Tekkang is right, that is the way we do it. I was just restating our method. The raid I was on did it differently and had some trouble with loot dispersal, IMO. One person was doing several jobs and confusion on loot occured.<br>
<br>
I was NOT saying we should break Hate in the SE corner. I personally think the SW corner, or the Arch just north of there is a better idea. My only reservation with the SW break is how do we get to the SW corner? We used to head out the the zonein building make an immediate right turn, run up to the top of the wall, turn right and run to SE corner, then turn right and run to SW corner, then turn right and run a little ways to just above the arch. The reason we took this route is to lower chances of aggro. Running along the top of the wall kept us as far as possible away from mobs. Everything I have heard makes me believe running along the top of the wall can aggro mobs above and lead to serious trouble. I think the current plan is to take the same route and run along the middle of the wall. This will require alot of displine and I am not sure we can pull it off. Also this brings us very close to the imps in the SW corner and if they see invisible I think we will aggro them. The middle of the wall run seems the best plan at this point; but maybe others will respond to this post that know of a better way?<br>

The prevailing logic on the SW corner these days is split into 2 camps, the run the middle of the wall and the run the streets to the SW corner. <br>
<br>
I don't care much for the running the streets idea if the zone is fully popped, deaths due to invis dropping and fearing could make the break in extremely long. We could, on the other hand combine methods. We could run the middle of the wall along the south and then skirt the SW Imp corner by running to the outside of that last building there. If attacked we could AE mez any mobs then run the clerics to SW and camp them out. This really all depends on having a rouge to scout the path. <br>
<br>
What I would like is for us to have a healthy and lengthy discussion about the break in before we decide anything. Pulling hate hasn't really changed much but the break in is gonna be the trick and I want to come up with a good strategy to minimize our down time upon break in. So keep the ideas comming.<br>

<br>
The SE corner of the zone in house is in the SE corner of the zone.  When I've been since the upgrade we did what Myriah had done where we zone in and run directly to the SE corner of that zoneing house and pack it into the corner.  During fighting, all casters STAY in that corner while tanks stay behind an imaginary line between the door and the SE corner.  Only chanters and tanks are free to run around to kill and spread out the mezzes.<br>
<br>
Once the pull team clears the path to the throne room, we moved to there and proceded to pull the rest of the zone as normal.  They key to survival was STAYING IN THE CORNER and for the tanks to never ever walk outside of the door of the zone in house <p>Elektra

<br>
When we clear this area we could attempt the other break ideas as if we just started. We then have a &quot;safe&quot; place in SE corner to CR if the other break idea fails. What do you think, or did Zenknight already says this?<br>
