I just turned 51 doing Cyndreela solo at the fear portal entrance.  It took approximately 3-4 Cyndreela kills to get 1 blue bubble of xp with my erudite wizard at level 50.  It took about 18-20 Cynd kills to fill one yellow bubble.  With her respawn time of about 5 minutes, it took about 1.5-2hrs to fill the yellow bubble.  To get through level 50 from start to finish this works out to about 8-10 hours of time spent.<br>
<br>
At 51, it takes about 7-8 Cynd kills to fill up one blue bubble of xp.  By doing the math, I'm looking at aobut 15-17 hours to get through this level.<br>
<br>
Are all the post 50 levels like this?  It seems like there must be better ways to gain xp...<br>
<br>
What tactics do you use to maximize experience?  and do you have any numbers to share?<br>
<br>
What kind of experience gains/hour/level are you seeing doing things like AE groups?  Single mob soloing?  Quad kiting?  &quot;Normal&quot; grouping?<br>

If you get four Blues in your kite then you get almost a full blue bubble off of half a mana bar so two blue bubbles per mana bar. Now compare that to the safer single kites or static spawns where you get 1/4 and in some cases 1/8 a blue bubble per mana bar. I am doing both even though multikiting is more fruitful I just cat seem to do in BW due to the sheer amount of wanderers and Tim Deep like I said being an very boring place. I am gonna try out Old Cynn in Feerott for a bit tommorow then head back into Tim deep or maybe back into CS. CS is very fun...

Indeed, 2 IC take her down, if open at max distance, she will never get to u.  Just sit closer to wall.

However, DL is a better place to hunt at 50. u can get constant supply of clarity,(i have jboot) and much more fun.<br>

For me, best exp was sitting in middle of sand area before the entrance to KC.  Use overhead view to med.  If I see anything blue to me while I have 3 blue bubble or more, snare/IC/IC/dd, med. If something wander toward u while u r lom, (usually don't happen much if u pick good spot), move a little out of way and med.  I have a steady pull of blue this way.

It went very quickly.  Just a couple things to add about the tatterback gorillas and scoriae hornets...<br>
<br>
Don't even think about messing with those things at level 51 unless you have an immense amount of +mana gear.  They will resist you a fair bit at 51 and have a ton of hp.  Stick with tottering gorillas, giant verdants, greater barbed/plagebones, cinder &amp; ember hornets.  Sarnak champs are also good if you can observe their movement first and make sure they aren't sowed (although this doesn't guarantee they won't be sowed by the time you finish your kite :P).  <br>
<br>
I was able to easily get a level per week soloing in BW.  That included time on the occasional raid, etc.  I went through 54 (hell level) in seven days just quad kiting and I wasn't even trying that hard.  54 was a joke for me.  It starts slowing down a fair bit at 55 as more stuff turns green but you can still do it if you know where to look. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=acranes>Acranes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/5/01 10:56:11 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Exp speed at 51+</span><hr size=1> This is how I break the Cynd spawn with her pet out:  Get all my buffs up, including a skin.  I place myself just to the right of the fake wall.  I creep up to her spawn area and target the pet.  I immobilize the pet and immediately target Cynd and run toward the perimeter as other skeletons do not roam there.  As soon as immobilize is back up, I root Cynd and let loose with 2 IC and she is dead.  I retarget the pet, 1 more IC and the spawn is ready to be camped.<br>
<br>
Then run up the ramp toward the fear portal being careful not to aggro anything on the way.  If you med to the right on the downward slope of the structure, she will not aggro on you on her next spawn.  And roamers won't see you.  I use Harvest and med and wait ~5 mins for her next spawn.<br>
<br>
When she next spawns, she starts casting her skin spell.  Wait until this spell is about 1/2 to 3/4 done casting or right when the green particles start gathering into her. She will then start casting her pet spell.  Start casting IC.  When it hits, temp flux, re-cast IC and she is dead all without aggroing on you.  The trick is getting the first IC to hit as she is casting the pet spell since she will do nothing while casting the pet and it takes a very long time.  I found that at 51, you even have enough time to get off a draught before the pet comes out if she partially resists.<br>
<br>
There are a few problems related to her spawn:  Sometimes people waiting to go into fear are hanging around her spawn area which will cause her to aggro on them.  In these cases I just blast her with IC, root, then IC again and ask the people to move out of her aggro range next time.  Also people running into fear sometimes train spectres to you.  So be ready.  If she resists an IC get ready to fight both her and the pet.  Keep a skin up.<br>
<br>
Overall it is a very easy kill and steady exp.  It was fine for me up until 51 at which point it has gotten extremely boring.<br>

I first scoped out the area and got accustomed to the layout of the zone.  After getting familiar with the beach and the spawn points of the wyverns, I decided to try the technique on one wyvern to get a feel for the quading procedure.  I got my shields up, diamond skin and levitate and ran toward the cliff from the beach toward the nearest wyvern.  I used the temp flux staff to pull him to the beach and cast BoF.  I used the temp flux staff to gauge distance and cast PoF until he was dead.  Even with partial resists I was left with a bit over a bubble of mana(Im lvl 51, with 196 int and little +mana gear).<br>
<br>
I medded up and pulled 2 wyverns on the next run and learned how to herd them close enough to get BoF and PoF to hit.  Even with a bit of difficulty, getting stuck on geometry and getting beat hard, both went down quickly and my xp bar had moved significantly.  On the next run I pulled 3 and was gaining confidence.  By the time this group went down, I felt extremely confident and pulled 4 on my next run.  All 4 went down and the experience was flying.<br>
<br>
During my stay I did run into a couple of problems.  First off, the drakes are such a pain in the ass.  Their aggro range seems to be ridiculously big and their AE spells hurt.  If a drake aggroed on me, I pulled them to the otters and had them do the work for me.  The other problem I ran into was when BoF was resisted by one or more to the wyverns.  Since the wyverns run at a fast pace, I would have to run for a while before I had enough room to recast bonds.  At that point, I would be so far from the original snared group that they would return to their spawn point.  Does anyone have suggestions for getting around this?  Its a bit frustrating pulling and herding the mobs together only to have them disappear on you.  One other problem I found was that when a druid was kiting and we crossed paths, once in a while but rarely, part of my group would go after him and Id have to reherd and bonds the group.<br>

Overall it was a fun experience.  Quadding is much more exciting than conventional soloing, and watching the xp bar jump in big chunks is very rewarding.  At lvl 51, my mana pool has not been a problem and I was gaining about 1 blue bubble of exp every 20-30 minutes.  As I get better at quadding, I can expect that I can maximize exp/time efficiency.<br>

Thank you to everyone on the board who have shared their experiences quadding.  Youve saved me many deaths and gained me lots of experience.<br>

Until about level 54 or 55 use Bonds of Force to snare them, after 54 use Atol's Spectral Shackles. I used Atol's since the day I got it, I really like the noticable speed difference over Bonds. It does fizzle a lot though, so to be on the safe side use Bonds. Once you get to the raptor islands in TD, head to the smaller island (it is noticably smaller, and it also has a ruined hut facing the chessboard). There is 1 single spawn across form the small island along with 2 regular spawns on the small island itself (One on the beach, one behind the hut). Refresh your levitate before each kite and begin. WHat worked the best for me is running close enough to the Raptor to aggro them, but far enough away so that they couldn't hit me and would fall in behind. Aggro the 3 raptors mentioned above like this, and run in parallel lines until they are grouped nicely. Cast whichever snare spell you decided on using and then begin AE nuking them. If one or more resists the snare, run far enough away so that you can resnare the one(s) that resisted. Once they are snared, move to a point where the 2 seperated groups of raptors form a &quot;V&quot; pattern, with you being at the point or tip of the V. This will allow them to regroup so you can snare them all again (This is important, it insures that allt he raptors stay snared for the same amount of time). Med at the rock wall farthest from the beach spawn and repeat the process whent hey pop again. Once you hit 54 or feel more sure of your abilities you can begin kiting the Vicious Raptor that spawns on the small isle, or if you want to you can move to a different isle and kite 4 different raptors.
