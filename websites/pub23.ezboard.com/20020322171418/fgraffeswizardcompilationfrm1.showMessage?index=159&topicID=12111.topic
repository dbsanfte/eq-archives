<br>
I've talked extensivly with GM's about these very issues.  Just becuase you've never seen them doesn't mean they don't exist, or arn't considered exploits.  And, in reality they arn't exploits, they are simply parts of the game that need to be fixed or tuned, but once a guild finds these issues, they use them to thier advantage to kill certain MOBs.  Verant classifies an exploit as something that gives the players an unfair advantage in an encounter.  The real debate comes in, when you try and decide weather the person or guild KNEW they were sploiting something.  When you get right down to it, it's all sematics.<br>
<br>
Allow me to give you examples of everything I've described:<br>
<br>
1.)    Pathing:  There are spots in ToV, SSra temple, Icewall keep, and countless other places where pathing can be abused or used as an advantage to kill MOB easily.  Alot of these issues I've seen fixed, but there are still some lingering.<br>
<br>
2.)  Aggro ranges:  Alot of this was back in the Velious days, but it still exists.  Tanking with Divine Aura was one of those great ways to kill rooted MOBs, that takes advantage of aggro range, becuase even though your wiped from the aggro list, its easy enough if you time it correctly with atone or something to make sure that DA person is the first on the aggro list becuase he's the closest.  This strat was used quite extensivly in killing Yelinak.  This was pre-cleric aggro fix.<br>
<br>
3.)  Line of Sight:  I'll be the first to admit that in it's current inception, this isn't an exploit.  I simply mentioned it becuase it was an exploit before Velious came out.  But, I would say using Z-axis to your advantage would come under this heading.<br>
<br>
4.)  Spell Loopholes:  Hmm, anyone remember the ol' CH spell loophole?  That's something alot of guilds won't admit too even though it made Phara'Dar quite easy.  Then again, I think I'd classify this as an AI issue more than anything.  Buff stacking sploits, yeah that was a great one.<br>
<br>
IMO, guilds don't go looking to exploit something, they simply stumble upon it, the only thing they don't do is report the bug, and then it becomes a *Sekret* strat.  But I guarantee you, once one person in a higher guild knows a sploit, it seems to migrate to other servers almost instantly, that's why VI clamps down on stuff the moment they know about it.  For the most part Verant has gotten rid of alot of possible exploits, but as long as new content is added there will always be bugs.<br>

So, yes...I don't like me or my guild being called moronic (implicit as it may be) by the likes of FK.<br>
<br>
The best part of all this, is that whenever Verant tosses something out there that requires more than MT/CH, people go off on how hard it is.  Amazingly, everything is either too easy (MT/CH) or too hard (any other strategy) in this game!<br>
<br>
FK, grats on twisting every word I say.  If you ever discover an original thought, come back and argue it.  <br>
<br>
p.s. My original post was directed at those who feel that everything is so easy.  The ones that never really had to suffer to figure stuff out because they read how-to's on message boards, stole from another guild, or had someone lead them and then have zero appreciation and show no respect for the work those people did.  FK has no respect.<br>

<br>
Certainly there are exceptions, no one ever said there were not. But the exceptions to the Bethude Strategy are almost all still based on the Bethude Principle of 'control aggro and you control the fight'. Ok, you have to rune and not CH, or you have to use multiple aggro concentration instead of single. Rotating aggro isn't that clever but it does require _discipline_ .. and MORE tanks. If someone tells me that most 'strategies' are not merely variations on a theme I will respectfully ask who they are trying to kid, themself or us?<br>
<br>
There are some few mobs where it is possible, practical, and better to chain stun, a few than can be kited, etc. But my contention is these are for the most part oversights by Verant, and the reason people don't want these 'secrets' to get out is because they know damned well they will be nerfed if they do.<br>
<br>
The observable truth is with a few exceptions VI does not like innovation. They like to control how many people are required to take down a mob, and DON'T like it when you figure out a imaginative way to do so. Generally they don't let it continue.<br>
<br>
I just think that the Bethude Strategy should not be so all pervasive. Personally I'd like to see half Bethude, and half various other things. Why can't we see a mob that _requires_ _pet_casters_? (there are instances where pet casters were the best thing.. NERFED) or a mob that _has_ to be bow kited?<br>
<br>
Granted there is only so much that can be done in a game like EQ, but for heavens sake.. it doesn't need to be the all Bethude Strategy all the time channel either.<br>
<br>
Also there is clearly some misunderstanding on the term 'zerg', probably some of it deliberate, but some people are using zerg to mean a blind rush, and some are using it to mean that part of the Bethude Strategy where the tanks are sent in. To me 'zerg' ing seems to appropriately mean a blind lemming rush, which is a 'strategy' that no one uses more than a couple times, (unless they are dense above and beyond the call of duty) so lets not associate 'zerg' with the Bethude Strategy, but more properly with the very first attempts of a new guild to take a big mob.<br>
<br>
People puffing themselves up because they watched a guild try to take a big mob for the first time and crash (because they DIDN'T study their forebears before the engagement) don't really impress me.<br>

Rombus,<br>

&quot;You asked to provide examples of strats that go against the standard MT/CH idea... I said I couldn't give them to you for specific reasons.&quot;<br>
<br>
You are confused. I never asked that. As I said I conceded you would find it very difficult to provide such an example. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>

<br>
Seriously though, I am sure you have a couple of things you know that do deviate from the Bethude Principle, Rombus, but I submit that the reason you try to conceal is not because you _really_ fear the competition, it's because you fear the cops. No you may not likely be labeled 'exploiters' because you have a good rappor with your gm's, but the risk of nerfing is always there. I will further submit it is not even greed, it is just the fact that if more people find out, more people will do it, and it will come to the attention of the powers that be with predictable results.<br>
<br>
But I think if you are honest, you will admit that one of the main criteria (perhaps not only, but main) of whether a tactic needs to be kept on the QT or not is it's lack of conformance with the Bethude Principle.<br>

Who would respect you? You sound like the very sort of player whom I would go out of my way to avoid at all costs, both in-game and in RL.<br>
<br>
I respect people like Graffe for providing class and community sites like this.  I respect people in game who are consistently amusing, good natured, or helpful; I've even been known to respect the occasional roleplayer;  I respect players who I play with who know how to play their class well, and I have quite a bit of respect for many of the competant guild-leaders I've met.  <br>
<br>
However, I personally don't have any particular respect for a guild merely because they are first to do a zone or first to figure out how to do a zone.  Don't get me wrong.  Grats to them, WTG! Great acomplishment!  <br>
<br>
It's merely not an accomplishment that ranks a guild in my mind with the people I mention above, because, at the end of the day, it's an accomplishment that will be emulated by vast numbers of EQ players eventually.  Those players will take various amounts of time to achieve their goals depending on their playing priorities and how much time they can devote to EQ.  But, if X-guild who is the first to break X-zone were to vanish from existence, and no record remain of their accomplishments or strategies, guess what? it wouldn't make any difference.  A hundred different guilds would work out strategies that work.  Unlike the people whom I mention above whom I do respect, people whose contribution to EQ is (in terms of how it effects my gameplay) unique, the contribution of any particular self-styled uber-guild on the game is negligible.  <br>

<br>

<br>
The biggest problem with this theory is, guess who gets watched the most on any server? A lot of the large guilds assume they have the server GM watching what they are doing and listening to the guild chat, and it isn't that bad of an assumption, as it does prove true quite often. Not only that, but in some cases if they have a questionable tactic might even run it by the GM beforehand. I can tell you from experience that your basic assumption here is faulty. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

<br>
The guild classifies the tactic used as proprietary, and forbids dissemination of said strategy. Those who post in violation of this policy face the possibility of guild removal. Whether the strategy itself is original or actually relatively widely known is beside the point. The US government has a bazillion documents stamped &quot;classified&quot; even though much of the material contained in those documents is relatively well known. It is easier to just have a blanket policy that covers everything than to systematically analyze each strategy. Rombus and others, by not sharing strategies, are merely fulfilling their guild obligations, and they are entirely justified in doing so.<br>
<br>
As for the specifics of the alternative VS strategy:<br>
1) all warriors of level 54 or below duel and are reduced to low enough health to land crippling blows<br>
2) pull VS<br>
3) warriors alternate activating their mighty strike discipline. It's best if you can have multiples with it up at the same time.<br>
4) Everyone else joins in the fray from the outset.<br>
<br>
Since crippling blows automatically stun, VS is perma-stunned and never gets off his life tap (or any attacks, for that matter).<br>
<br>
Note the characteristics of this strategy:<br>
- there is no main tank<br>
- there is no agro management<br>
- there is no complete heal order<br>
- as long as the rest of the guild can do enough damage in 20 seconds or so to get the kill, it's almost a slam dunk.<br>
- this strategy does not work very well on virtually any other boss mobs<br>

Nah, I'm want Bethude to get all the credit he deserves for his innovation, his gift to EQ. Remember, he wants respect above all else for his strategic genious and I think he deserves it!<br>
<br>
&quot;I can tell you from experience that your basic assumption here is faulty.&quot; - Qaman<br>
<br>
I am not sure you got my assumption. Do you disagree that if the supposed 'non-Bethude' based strategy were released, it would be copied, used a lot and attract bad attention, with the inevitable result?<br>
<br>
I am absolutely certain that certain guilds have their chat monitored from time to time, and I also know that some things are allowed as long as they are not too visible. When they become visible...<br>
<br>
Jeepers how can people so completely miss the point? It's not that there are not innovative people! No one ever suggested this. Nor has anyone here disdained the achievements of the pioneers. The point is innovation is squelched when discovered. Strategies not based on the Bethude Principle are not in the vision. Look at PBAE, as long as it was hidden away in dark secluded places where it wouldn't upset too many melees everything was fine. When it happenned in the grey and people SAW it .. OMG something caster centric, WHAM goes the nerf bat. And alas not just in the grey. Same thing re quadding there, long as it was raptors in the boonies of tim deep, no problem, but casters doing it IN THE OPEN in front of god and everybody, SLAM goes the nerf bat.<br>

Armok,<br>
<br>
Yep, that is very clever. But it is one case. Further the prescribed Bethude Principle based chain rune (with disciplines as available) works too.<br>
<br>
And I would not be suprised to see that strategy nerfed at any point. Especially now you made it visibly public<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Again, don't miss the point. Which is not there cleverness does not exist, but it is squelched.<br>

<br>
More often than not, guilds keep tactics secret becuase it's a sense of accomplishment.  Contrary to what you've been posting there are Creatures in this game that require a little more finesse than just Main Tanking and Complete Heal.  There are things you are totally forgoing here, such as:<br>
<br>
Resists<br>
Positioning<br>
Spell usage (Complete Heal isn't the catch all for every encounter)<br>
Timing Spawns that surround a given MOB<br>
Aggro Range<br>
Getting to a specific Location<br>
Doing certain things to Spawn a given MOB<br>
Timing<br>
Pulling strageties to get said MOB alone<br>
<br>
See, there are quite a few things that could make up killing a given MOB.  Oftentimes there is a specific order in which you need to apply debuffs in order for a slow to land, it's stuff like that makes a difference.  <br>
<br>
Another part of the reason is that if guilds just gave away strats for given MOBs, it cheapens the game, becuase EQ should be about challenge, and challenges don't come from reading a message board for strats.  Personally, I think higher level guilds are right to not post tactics, becuase it preserves the game.  It sounds cheesy, but it's true.<br>

Which is just proving my point that you are using it as a subtle personal attack. It is still uncalled for.<br>
<br>
&gt;I am not sure you got my assumption. Do you disagree that if the supposed 'non-Bethude' based strategy were released, it would be copied, used a lot and attract bad attention, with the inevitable result?<br>
<br>
Actually, I do disagree with it. Your assumption that people don't want to show any differing strategies for fear of it being nerfed is false in most cases (it may be true in some, yes). Do you think if there was no danger at all of a strategy/tactic being nerfed they would be released? The answer is, no they wouldn't. Competition at the upper levels is pretty decent, and giving a hand up to other guilds is not something you want to do as this just increases the competition.<br>
<br>
&gt;Jeepers how can people so completely miss the point? It's not that there are not innovative people! No one ever suggested this. Nor has anyone here disdained the achievements of the pioneers.

<br>
We aren't missing your point, we just think you are wrong. If they wanted to nerf PBAE as a tactic, they would nerf the spell not a zone. Same thing with quadding. I can think of a number of things that would make either untenable, but they haven't been done. Other than some balancing of zones themselves the spells work the same as always did. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

<br>
&lt;cue predictable joke about me being impressed easily&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm in the unenviable position of agreeing partially with both sides of this argument, coming in late as I have. I've read both sides and it seems that some people are saying &quot;everything can be MT/CH'd&quot; while others say &quot;nuh-uh, there are a few mobs you can't&quot; and it goes back and forth with no-one really listening to anything anyone has to say - maybe because there doesn't seem to be any respect for other people's abilities?  I dunno. Like someone else said already, there's what, 400,000+ people in this game. When you so blindly adhere to your own viewpioint without taking into consideration the knowledge of anyone else do you mean to tell me that you think that you're the smartest of all of those 400,000+ people?<br>
<br>
I for one know that I'm not the best wiz in the world of Norrath, and that it's quite likely that there are alot of people out there that know a hell of alot more about wizzying <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You can extend that statement to raids &amp; say that I know I know x/y about raids, where &quot;x&quot; is what I know, and &quot;y&quot; is all there is to know. There's probably alot of people out there that know about 100x/y, so hey, who am I to assume that the way I think of doing something is *the* way to do it? <br>
<br>
I'll pretty much agree that most things you can MT/CH rotate, but there are some things that it looks like you at least have to change the routine a little on. One example already given is the Dain. He pingpongs all over the shop, even when you pull him &quot;properly&quot; and then let an MT get aggro. All you seem to get if you try that is alot of dead people and an MT zapped away from the fight :/<br>
<br>
Just from my own very limited experience I see that even with the mobs that you can MT/CH on alot of the &quot;tactics&quot; in a fight refers to what you do before you actually engage, such as positioning, how to pull, etc. Sure, you might see them as extensions of the MT/CH idea but as Vulp said using the chess metaphor the minitiae of alterations to the original idea are normally what get the job done in the more efficient manner. Sure you can throw yourselves at it and come through with the plain vanilla MT/CH, but if you use a bit more intelligence on the setup and timing of things whilst using that method, customising certain aspects of the known strategy to suit the mob then you'll probably come out alot worse for wear, or perhaps get the mob down quicker than you would have if you had not, or perhaps be able to do it with less people present.<br>
