<br>
I know this is only on test, and may not go live, but I am left wondering why the hell anyone chooses any class since all the classes are slowly becomging the same. Virtually any class can duplicate the abilities of another class through either spells or equipment. I dont understand what decisions a player is left with.<br>
<br>
Why can a warrior turn invisible via cobalt greeves?? He is a warrior, stealth is not his bag -- having lots of hps is the way he gets out of a jam, not by hiding! <br>
<br>
Why would a Shaman be able to heal to this extent (keep in mind that I play a shaman). Shaman already slow the best in the game -- they are proactive healers, not reactive. It should be that if you need a shaman to heal you, it is too late  <br>
<br>
Why do priest classes get spiritstones?? It is nice to gate sure -- but if you wanted easy travel, you should have playeda wiz or druid. Transportation should be their specialty.<br>
<br>
The whole point is that each class should bring someting unique to the table which makes them desireable. In my mind this was already done. Druids have a wealth of spells which are useful (even on raids - Soe, limited healing, ports, some damage). If the only thing a druid could do is quickly get people in and out of raids, that would be enough to warrant them coming!<br>
<br>
Some people complain that they are not wanted on raids -- this is also bullshit. Is your guild telling you that you cannot come on the raid becuase you are useless? If this is the case, then you need a new guild! Do you feel the grass is greener in some other classes yard? Visit any class board and you will find all whine equally when it comes to this topic. To date I cannot think of one class that I would not have a use for on a raid or in an exp grind group.<br>
<br>
BTW -- this game is only fun when it is hard. And, it should be hard at all levels of the experience (not just 50+). All the changes in the last year have been akin to discovering the cheat codes -- sure they make the game easy, and that may even be fun for a day or two, but it certainly isn't going to keep you coming back for more.<br>
<br>
In closing, if you have a problem with your classes' abilities -- learn to deal with it, or play something else! I am so sick of people who suck at this game complain that the game does not do enough to let them succeed.<br>

<br>
You won't NEED clerics to have a group; oftentimes, because my group is unable to find a cleric we have to give up for the day.  However, clerics have better heals, buffs, *and* they have rez, which will still make them STRONGLY desired in a group.  The new heals only heal up to 2250 or 75% of someone's health, which means that on any typical high level tank (not uber gear- let's say 4500 hp), this is only a half heal, for the same mana it costs a cleric to cast a complete heal.<br>
<br>
I wish people would stop running around screaming in terror about a change before they actually thought about it and realized how it might have a very direct benefit for them.  Complete Heal broke the game.  Maybe now they're doing something to try and fix the gap it caused. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaryoch.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aryoch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/21/02 9:49:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1404.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CH on test to Druids and Shammies.</span><hr size=1> Your point is well taken, except that as it stand at this moment, for most exp grind groups, we did not need a cleric anyway.  A shaman slow and Shaman/Druid heals were more than sufficient to do many of the grinds in seb, chardok, KC and other high level gridning zones.  Many clerics complain already that their class is boring to play in these zones, becuase with the large AC/Hps most tanks have, heals are not as frequent.  If clerics already have a hard time getting exp groups, this is going to marginalize them further.<br>
<br>
There is a flaw in the design, in that many people find clerics necessary for an event, but there is a shortage of clerics -- so instead of making the cleric class more desireable to play, they are going to give the clerics skills to some other classes which are more popular, and will become even more so.<br>
<br>
I just think that the weaknesses of a class are as interesting as its strengths -- and when we learn to live with (and work around) the weaknesses, we become better players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uclaudshadowflare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ClaudShadowflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/21/02 12:24:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1404.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.the-commune.com/forum/images/avatars/40.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CH on test to Druids and Shammies.</span><hr size=1> This however opens up a lot of more difficult zones to be done without a cleric; like Cazic Thule (possibly), The Deep, and other zones where the common mobs hit for 200+.

<br>
I hear a lot of warriors complaining about this because Paladins/SK's could become better tanks. In most cases they can keep aggro over a warrior already. But with the addition of the abilities like block and being able to keep the dmg taken down it could be a true thing. This with CH for druids and shamans I think is good in some ways, but bad in others. (All we need now is those Dr00ds out there being the Main Healers in groups.)<br>

Some ideas are:<br>
<br>
* A cleric version of Chloroblast, making them the fastest healers in the game.<br>
* A group DA. Level 60 bards have it, so why not?<br>
* A rune type spell. What better way to make a healer more effective then to be able to prevent damage in the first place?<br>
* A spell that would provide reserve mana that could only be used for heals, like a manastone.<br>

Giving Druids and Shaman a limited doesn't HAVE to unbalance the game, although I agree with the previous point about druids - they already have too many abilities. <p>Baron Blither Aleracer,

I mean holy fuck! Is it just a matter of time before they start handing out spells to warriors? This is absolutely ridiculous and if it goes live I would more than likely quit playing this horridly addictive, time wasting, money sucking, bugged to all hell game.<br>

Why even bother with clerics now? Just everyone start a druid since they can do all but tank? All we need now is warriors that can KEI and we're set. Just need 3 classes for uber mobs... warrior, dr00d, and rogue.<br>
<br>
Hey VI, while your at it, why not give dr00ds DA and make it last about 10 mins and have it so they can cast and attack while it's on. Give them backstab too, that'll really eliminate all other classes in the game so you would have your most loved class running around slaughtering whatever they want.

Velious and Luclin have been designed around CH. This, added to the effect on their epic, made the cleric the central class in the game for all guilds. Giving a little choice for group/raid composition and allowing everyone to participate and guilds to raid even if they don't have the &quot;mandatory&quot; 6 clerics is a rather good idea... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umithrull.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mithrull</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.home.net/efitch70/usflag.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/25/02 10:20:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1404.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: CH on test to Druids and Shammies</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<br>
This view depends on whether one is illogically preoccupied with the limit set on Cleric CH, or whether they understand that the power of CH is relative to the targets HP. Suppose Clerics got a 100k heal at level 39. Would this change anything? Make Clerics more powerful or wanted. Nope. It's meaningless because so long as you're dealing with a number that is always going to be greater than the target's HPs, it doesn't matter in the least exactly how large the heal is. Forget about 10k and your silly 30% figure. Endeavor to find out what how much CH actually heals for IN PRACTICE, then compare it to a 3k heal.  <p>Mithrull 52 Channeler
