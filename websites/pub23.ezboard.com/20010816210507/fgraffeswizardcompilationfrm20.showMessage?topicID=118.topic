I might as well give a Spankda update.<br>
<br>
Spankda dinged level 50 last night in Cobalt Scar.  I've been killing Cobalt Drakes mostly with a few Wyverns whenever I can't find a Cobalt Drake to kill.<br>
<br>
When I first visited Cobalt Scar, I was certain I would never have the intestinal fortitude to try a Cobalt Drake.  The drake has an AoE DD that hits for up to 500 points of damage and dispells.<br>
<br>
All the reading on this topic of killing drakes suggested they have a spell casting range that's half or so of ours.  Yeah.  I'd say that's true.<br>
<br>
Anyway, finally I snared and rooted a drake and hit it with Rend at 49.  Ice Comet is a very bad choice for killing anything in Cobalt Scar that is an icy thingy.  Drakes and Wyverns are such beasties.<br>
<br>
Basically, it's snare, back up, root, rend.  If root (I use immobilize -- I tried paralyzing earth but there is no difference) breaks, back up, re-root, rend.  Four rends and a small nuke to finish.<br>
<br>
I haven't seen an overabundance of quest gems.  I got lucky early yesterday and found a flawed emerald and nephrite.  I've looted a number of spells including some mage spell named maelstorm, corpal empathy for necros, and three enticement of flames.<br>
<br>
I sold seven Cobalt Drake hides too. <br>
<br>
Okay. So, I single kited Drakes and Wyverns almost exclusively from 49 to 50.<br>
<br>
How'd I get to 49?  Well, I multi-kited Walruses and Ulthork Man-O-Wars in EW at the Icefang huts just South of the Kael entrance.  Location is NEG 8000 POS 3200.  I have it memorized because I also TL people from there all the time.<br>
<br>
Or I did.  I've left EW for now.  I found I'd quad four walruses and get a few man-o-wars to spawn and some druid would be killing the man-o-wars I just caused to spawn.  Of course, I was OOM and meditating during this time.<br>
<br>
However, there are blue walruses there at 48 and I had a full quad of blues at times at 47 and 48 both.  If you can't find a blue walrus there is always a mammoth or wooly rhino nearby that's blue.<br>
<br>
Blue walruses here have a healthy HP.  I would often have to run ahead of my snared walruses and cast Harvest to finish.<br>
<br>
I'm in no hurry to leave Cobalt Scar for now.  I can single kite the Wyverns and Drakes for a while and I'll be collecting the quest gems.  The gems are rare, but I had a couple guild mates join me yesterday afternoon and two more dropped.  <br>
<br>
I just run up and down the upper area there.  If I agro another Wyvern, because they do help each other, I snare both and nuke one, then zone into SS.<br>
<br>
I've had one Drake and the other agro'd too.  I simply left the first rooted in place and snared, rooted, and nuked the second to death then zoned.<br>
<br>
I can kill a drake with two full blue bubbles of mana left.  I can kill a wyvern with two and a half left.<br>
<br>
I haven't tried anything in TD yet.  I don't plan to.  I simply am not going to a place I can't be bound at.<br>
<br>
For group XP, Sirens Grotto and Velks Lab are good places.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwandork.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wandor K</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/24/01 10:59:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Spankda Update -- Level 50</span><hr size=1> Get a wizzy friend and quad the wyverns. You pull and nuke 5 or 6 times, then your friend runs along with you and finishes the pull. Its a good idea to run the same route everytime so you know where you should be running to, the last thing you need is to split the pull. You should both be left with about 30% mana after a good pull. Killer exp and a way better chance to get gems.<br>
<br>
At 51 you can quad solo with Pillar of Frost.<br>

I really do love reading these, they're full of great information and its nice to see your progress throughout the levels.<br>
<br>
I'm level 45 right now, and am testing the waters for a few of the areas you and others have recommended to quad-kite.<br>
<br>
Dreadlands - I spend a lot of time here, mainly because there's lots of spawns and many enchanters and druids for clarity and SoW.  I mostly single kite drolvargs and cockatrices, they seem to give decent XP for their level.  Have to be careful with with the drolvargs, their faction means that you can easily add in more than 1 when single kiting.  Haven't tried quad-kiting anything yet because of the variation of spawns.  (Hard to get more than 1 of the same type of monster)<br>
<br>
Overthere - Very good for single kiting, quadding is a bit more difficult here.  Tried the Sarnak ruins for a few quads, but it seems that most of the ruins spawned both berzerkers (green at 45) and knights (blue at 45).  I'd rather not have green cons mixed in if I can help it, so I resorted to single kites instead.<br>
<br>
If you can find a blue con succulant, they're one of the best kites you can do in the Overthere.  Very easy to kill and decent XP and loot.<br>
<br>
Eastern Wastes - Haven't gone back here yet, it was too difficult to sort out Ulthork warriors from the Ulthork hunters at 44, and on my server (Druzzil Ro) the area is heavily camped most of the time.  Might go try the walruses near Kael, just to see how they con at 45.<br>
<br>
I'm stubborn in the fact that I will only quad if I can get 4 blue con monsters of the same type.  I know this can cut down on the number of quad-kites I can get in, but for now I'm happy with single kiting with the occasional quad.<br>
<br>
I would love to go to Cobalt Scar and try they Wyverns, but my SS faction is at threateningly now and I don't have a CS key yet.  If I can make it over there, I'll give it a shot.  (Wouldn't mind turning in the many tusks I have in the bank, either, just to free up the room!)<br>
<br>
I'm open to any suggestions any of you might have, particularly Spankda since he's been my inspiration for getting to where I am today.  Without his updates, I doubt I could have gotten this far already!<br>

Can't remember which.<br>
<br>
I didn't know 51 was a hell level.  It is.  First thing I did was inscribe and memorize Pillar of Frost and grab four wyverns.  My first quad in 51 was four wyverns and I got half a blue bubble for it. <br>
<br>
I can not stress enough how wonderful Pillar of Frost is.  Hits four critters for 755 per.  Granted, *ARCTIC* Wyverns are not necessarily the best target for PoF, but hey, it works for the most part.  I'm finding a lot of partials and full resists on PoF means I need to run ahead to get a Harvest for the final blow.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, I even have to use my Solist's Icy Wand to finish.  Icy being a key word here, it's not the best but it suffices.<br>
<br>
My big problem is finding four wyverns.  Most of the time, I can not.  At most, I can get three.  Hey, three works.  CS is heavily camped.<br>
<br>
Atol's Spectral Shackles rocks.  I've had wizards tell me it sucks.  It does not.  It does fizz a bit more than BoF, but not significantly.  Nothing I can't handle for sure.  The extra slow speed is awesome.  The extra time is even better.  I have yet to have had Atol's wear off before my final nuke.  What a refreshing experience.<br>
<br>
Draught of Fire is an incredible solo-kite spell.  With a 3.0 second casting time, I can use DoF to kite without snaring.  Yep, grap a wyvern, run ahead until the Staff says you're out of range, stop, pause one-thousand-one, one-thousand-two, cast, repreat.  I did this just for grins.  Snaring is always safer.<br>
<br>
Atol's seems to have a larger snare radius.  I've been in Sol B to get some items for my son's druid.  I've snared myself with Atol's about 8 out of 10 tries.  Not significant in a dungeon experience with a full group, but still painful.<br>
<br>
I did get a couple copies of Tishan's Discord via the FV quest.  I've been collection 50+ spells since my teens or earlier.  Mostly with nice guild mates giving them to me.  Only now do I realize how important these spells are.  Most of them that I had multiple copies of are very common Kunark drops. Hey.  I turned them in repeatedly for spells and finally got the much sought after spells including Abscond, Tishan's Discord, etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showMessage?topicID=124.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showMessage?topicID=106.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.emailToFriend?topicID=118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.threadControl?topicID=118.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=118.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=118.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm11">Velium Chill of Al'Kabor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm6">Tome of Ages Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm30">Veeshan's Peak Key</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20>AE Kiting</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
