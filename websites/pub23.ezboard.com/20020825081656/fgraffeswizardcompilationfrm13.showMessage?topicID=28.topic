It wasn't easy. In no way was this quest even the slightest bit easy. And if I screw up on the hand-in, I'm not going to do it again. But, if your crazy, and have a lot of time to spare...Rough Silver Chain is a great peice of &quot;free&quot; resist gear.<br><br>There's two specific parts that are going to interest people, so I'm not going to bother about anything else. The Coldwater Barracuda Livers and the Fresh Chunks of Wooly Rhino.<br><br>I spent only about six hours harvesting the barracuda's for the liver. I would go down to the loc's given by Mordrede7th in another post (+1222, +660 and +1170, +11), and kill all that I could find, then go to shore to single wyverns for 45 minutes before going back down. For those of you having a little difficulty for finding the Barracuda's, I would levitate before going down and bring my line of sight down so that I technically wasnt underwater, but could see under the water level as far as my clip plane would allow me. It's invaluable for Bloodgills, too. I would suggest getting J-Boots up before going down, too, along with Levitate, because if you do get agro from one of the sharks that hunt along there you dont want to waste the mana to deal with it; just run to shore and camp. And keep Yonder up in case you run into Sirens. Im not sure how the spawn table works, but I killed the small cobalt fish just to be sure they werent holding the spawn for Barracuda's. It only took a poke nuke, not too much of a waste of mana, and it might have saved a lot of time.<br><br>The Fresh Chunks of Wooly Rhino were nowhere near as easy as the livers. It's taken me a long, long time to get all four peices. I even memorized the Rhino drop tables, that's how long I've been doing this. My biggest recommendation is that, if your going to do this part of the quest, be low enough level that your going to gain experience from the Rhinos. It'll give you a reason beside the never dropping meat to go there. At level 50, most Rhino's conned light or deep blue, and I gained 3 and a half gold hunting here alone for the last little while. This is factoring in that Im accident prone and died an uncountable number of times while doing this quest. Over 10 that I didnt get rezzes on, and a bunch that I did. Had I not died once doing this, I estimate I probably would have gained a bar and a half of experience.<br><br>Eastern Wastes is a very easy zone to get lost in, so I'll give you my experience. Rhino's will spawn the most readily by the Ulthork pits at about -7100, 0. But because of the spawn cycle, eventually you will wipe out the Rhino population and be faced with a field full of Ulthorks. The best time to do this quest is when Ulthorks are being camped by some low 40's or high levels for tusks. Also, kill any Snow Bunnies you see. They go down with one Shock of Lightning and will probably save you a lot of time.<br><br>Rhino's dont <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> only</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> spawn here, though. Once you do inevitably run out of Rhino's, you can go hunting in other places. By the bridge to Iceclad (along-4500, -4000) and the eastern wall of the zone you can find the occasional roamer. Also, once I found three fairly close together right at the top of the ramp to Kael Drakkel (-6000, +3000). Finally, Rhino's will spawn along the general vicinity of the Ry'Gorr fort (-4100, +300), which was my bind spot and base of operations while I did this quest.<br><br>There's a difference between the Rhino's you'll find at the Ulthork's and the roaming Rhino's: the roamers are higher level, and thus have more HP. It takes two Ice Comet's to take down an Ulthork Fort Rhino, and three to kill a roamer. As far as I can tell, their drop rate is no different.<br><br>Some general suggestions for doing this quest. I'll mention the experience thing again; if I didnt gain experience from killing Rhino's, I wouldnt have done it. You'll be able to kill them faster if your higher level, but eventually your going to run out no matter how fast you kill them, and you'll be forced to kill place holders or look around the wastes at fm for half an hour before you can find a rhino. Another suggestion of mine is not to quad kite these things if you only have Circle of Force at your disposal. The nuke is just too low and when they get low HP, they'll scatter. I've been quad kiting since level 23, and it just wasnt worth it for me to quad these things. As I said before, eventually, you'll get them all anyways. My final suggestion is that you ask your guildmates if anyone needs Rhino Horns for their Coldain Ring quests. They're fairly rare (no where near as rare as the meat), and they'll probably appreciate the offer.<br><br>Well, I better hand in these peices now. Final words: this quest isn't going to be worth the reward if your sane. I'm different: questing for me is great, I love the challenge and there's nothing like a good quest. Half the reason I love the reward is that it's going to be very rare, as anyone in their right mind is going to avoid this quest like the devil itself. Good luck, wizards. <p><center><img src="http://evantine.homestead.com/files/evantine.jpg"><br><font size=-3><a href="http://www.geocities.com/knightsofthesilvermoon/Evan.html">Storyline</a> | <a href="http://www.graffe.com">Graffe's Wizard Compilation</a> | <a href="http://www.iron-tower.com/">Iron Tower</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uyaldin111.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yaldin111</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/11/02 10:09:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm13.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=28.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Goes Faster</span><hr size=1> It goes MUCH faster if you quad rhino's by the Giant Fort near the orc fort, they pop readily near loc 0 0 (jail) and finding 4 isn't a problem specially if others are hunting ulthorks.
