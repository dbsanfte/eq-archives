Both banes ($$ /wave pp) are scribed.  I've got my epic, I've been there, and done that.<br>
<br>
Here's what it comes down to:  those who say wizards are underpowered DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE CLASS.<br>
<br>
We're not even remotely close to underpowered.  Between concussion and the epic skin, I can do disgusting amounts of damage (like more than a 60 rogue using duellist) and never be aggro for more than a few seconds.  We can quad kite, we can crowd control, we can evac, we can stun (which is hugely valuable, when used properly), and all the rest.<br>
<br>
Melees do more damage than us ONLY when you're talking about sustained damage rate over a period of several hours.  But in terms of mob-must-die-right-now-no-questions-asked damage, nobody can even come close.  And OMG the bane spells.. everyone used to believe rogues were the key to velious uber mobs, but lemme tell you, nothing puts em down quite like a bane.<br>
<br>
To you young wizards out there who read the whine posts on this board, just be patient, put in your time, and get yourselves to level 60.  Trust me, it's well worth the effort. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/5/01 8:58:36 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/grim3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Day, Same old Whining</span><hr size=1> Good to hear you believe Wizards are not underpowered when they are level 60 with both bane spells, the epic, and concussion quests done.

When it's all said and done, and I get a group that works well, something ALWAYS happens where i have to burn if we're together long enough.  And I LOVE it.  I picked a wizard because I wanted to kill stuff.  I wanted to be able to go FLASH and there's nothing left but a corpse.  2.5 seconds, dead MOB.  I actually go back to Blackburrow and do train cleanup for fun just for that reason every now and then.  knowing that I'll always have that ability to kill something fast, I'll be here till lvl 60... if EQ doesn't shut down before then.<br>

I don't think it's that wizars are underpowered, however...it's that tanks get so twinked now-a-days that wizard damage at anything under level 60 is no where near comparison.  And since I am a casual gamer, I really don't think that I'll ever hit 60, get my banes, and raid everyday.  Hell, I'll be happy to make it far enough just to see the Planes.  I just wish Verant would make it a little easier for the casual gamer.  I know that would throw everything out of whack, but I have a job, school, and a life outside of my PC.  I can't afford to play 4 hours a day.  Heck i'm lucky if i get in 4-5 hours a week.  I don't want an uber damage upgrade, i don't want a pet, i don't want group buffs.  I want to be able to play a little at a time and not be totally surpassed by someone who can twink the hell out of their alts because they have 30 hours a week to blow off.  (i'm sure it sounds like i'm asking for a nerf, but that's not it either...i'm not sure how to fix this whole scenario with out nerfing something somewhere)  oh well....maybe when SW: Galaxies comes out all this class balance BS will be gone.  And fun will be the main focus for people, not damage/delay...not efficency(sp)...not who has what uber weapon...FUN <p><font color=#3399FF>Maylor Conornis<br/>

It's a bit easier to level, so you level in fewer hours of gaming, but because you're limited to a number of hours per month per account, you're probably going to level no faster in real time compared to the people who play 30 hours a week.<br>
yes, I did jsut make this up now. <p><br>Aniar Orrenson

anyway grim is right and you are right in some ways<br>
<br>
the epic is really good especially with manastone(notasgood)/ manna robe (uber!!) the stuns are good evac is good and whatever else you mentioned and so far the only thing i havent done  is ae grouping so i know how to play this class other than that so can u explain to me why i cant get into a group, and dont say some stupid shit like well group with friends/guild cause i already know that or cause you overbrun/dont know hwo to play your class. unless u consider sitting down in (insert dungeon here) LFG for a few hours <br>

Well, I just leveled my warrior to 60 and basically retired my 60 wizard.  Wizards suck.  For a little more damage, wizards give up everything else.  In many cases, wizards dont even outdamage warriors better yet rogues.<br>
<br>
No, I am not a newbie.  I won my servers wizard botb.  I led a top guild on my server for over a year.<br>
<br>
Yes, I wish wizards were balanced.  I argued for it and I still think there is hope if they actually make caster items in the next expansion.  Until then, I will play my warrior and have fun.<br>

<br>
It may not SEEM like a huge upgrade, but going from previous draughts to draught of ice IS a significant upgrade(in Kunark, not Velious).  683 damage for previous draughts, 726 damage for draught of ice per cast.  It REALLY adds up if you cast 4 times since it's the same mana and casting time.<br>
<br>
<br>
But, there's other issues than those mentioned earlier in this thread.  If you sit in OS shouting for a group, and DON'T give up, and keep trying, you will find that the more time you spend there, the easier it becomes to get a group as you level up.  If you give up, go off soloing, then come back and expect to get groups, forget it, it probably won't happen.  If people know you, and from experience know that you are a wizard that is a benefit to your group, you get groups easier and easier.  The problem is that most don't stick with it to let others know you can play your class well.<br>
<br>
Back before Velious, I went to OS at level 51, shouted for groups, and after a while, I started getting them within 30 minutes of my shouting.  Then Velious came out, and I went off to explore(I find exploring new zones more fun than sitting in one camp for 4+ hours).  A few months later, I went back to OS, and couldn't get a group because most of the people I had grouped with moved on to Velious.  I just couldn't get a group.<br>
<br>
So, I got annoyed, and stuck it out, explored some more, got guild groups here and there, and explored some of the other zones in Velious.  And again, I found that I wasn't getting groups, until I just decided to stick with one zone, and NOT hop around.  As the people in each zone get to know me, and my play style, I get groups easier and easier.  They KNOW that not all wizards suck, but they have seen too many wizards who cast once, twice, or three times, then sit down, and don't make their presence KNOWN.  I'll burn down a mob or two(and they see the mobs drop quick when I do), and I'll med out on others.  They can feel and see the difference I bring.  It's about perception, and letting others SEE that we add to a group.<br>
<br>
What's better, doing 2k damage to each mob you face, or 6k damage to every third mob.  The first will be more of a steady contribution, but the 6k will drop the mob, and make your presence FELT.  Who will they remember of these two when melees are KNOWN for their steady damage, and they can't see the damage we do with our spells.  They get disciplines, and we all SEE critical hits, and all the amazing damage output that discs can add over a short period.  Wizards are about amazing damage over a short period, but it's not seen when we kick it into gear, unless we make a point of it.<br>
