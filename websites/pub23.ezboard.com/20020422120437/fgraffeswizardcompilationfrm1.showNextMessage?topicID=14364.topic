Maullus Kaherdin of the Innoruuk server, Human wizard, currently level 13. I have been playing EQ for almost a year, switched servers once, characters quite a few more times, before I finally found _the character_ I like. I always believed myself to be a melee or hybrid player, until I started my wizard. There is nothing quite like it.<br><br>Thank you for enduring that, now I may continue on with the actual subject of the post.  I have done as much reading as I can on Wizards, on Graffe's and on other sites as well. I truly hope to be able to learn this class, and play it as well as possible, which is why I am asking the following question: <br><br>When, as in what situation, should Area Effect spells be used? I read the AoE guide on this site, and while very informative, it did leave me with a few questions that arose during actual encounters. For example, when is it wise to use a personal aoe? Or, when should I use a Rain AoE, as opposed to a single blast AoE? Should I try to root park my targets before AoE? When is it wiser to AoE rather than DD the target the MA is attacking? Should AoEs be used rather than rooting?<br><br>Ok, forgive me for the bombardment of questions.  Please bear in mind that I am still rather low level, so the situation in North Ro on dervs (for example), is probably quite different from Old Sebilis.  <br><br>Maullus Kaherdin <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoramon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goramon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/02 9:59:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15726.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Area Effect Spells </span><hr size=1> Due to the way the game is currently played, it is doubtful you'll use AEs much, however, to answer your questions...<br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When, as in what situation, should Area Effect spells be used?<br>For example, when is it wise to use a personal aoe?<br>Or, when should I use a Rain AoE, as opposed to a single blast AoE?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>Targetted AE spells are used for quadding.  If you have multiple tanks in your group, and one tank is on one mob, with no adds, and none mezzed, these can be used.  However, if you use it too soon, you'll get agro.  This takes some timing that you really just have to learn.  Note: if you're too close, these will hit you too.<br><br>PBAE spells are used for AE groups.  Please refer to example one for a regular group.<br><br>Rains can be used in the same situation as targetted AEs, but the same rules apply.  In my experience, rains are best used in open areas on single targets, as they generally have a better ratio, and split the damage across 3 waves, instead of 1 blast.  This helps with your agro.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Should I try to root park my targets before AoE?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>If you're using a Rain type spell, rooting the target prior to casting is a good tactic.  While not always reliable, it is necessary for the target to remain in place for all 3 waves.<br>In the case of regular AE spells, rooting is not necessary if you're managing agro correctly.  On a side note, root parking 4 targets prior to a single shot AE, or PBAE will not only waste a TON of mana, but root will never hold long enough for it to matter anyway.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When is it wiser to AoE rather than DD the target the MA is attacking?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>I assume by this you mean a Rain type spell.  If you're handling agro well, a rain type spell will generally give you a little more &quot;bang for the buck&quot; than a single shot DD.  However, if you need the target dead - now - use a DD.  They cast faster, and have a MUCH faster refresh than rain spells.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Should AoEs be used rather than rooting?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>I assume you mean, instead of root parking the mob, should i let them all come then use AE ?  It depends on the group.  If it's a multi tank group with no chanter, yes, let them all come.  If it's a single tank group with no chanter, root parking is generally a good idea, and AE is NOT.  If it's any group with a chanter, they'll be handling it.  You generally won't need to root, and you certainly won't be using AE's.<br><br>Now, once you get into AE groups, all these rules are basically null and void, but, I won't bother with that ;)<br><br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ps:  it's 1am, i'm tired, and hope i made sense...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <p><br><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=113364" target=new><img src="http://divinusvirtus.freeservers.com/sig.jpg" border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uhippolytahelios.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hippolyta Helios</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/02 2:47:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15726.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Area Effect Spells </span><hr size=1> I'm trying to be brief, but mostly failing...<br><br>RAINS<br>At your level, I seem to remember that the rain spells were pretty darn good. But later on, the risk of getting a resist usually outweighs the better mana-to-damage ratio. Then again, sometimes you find a mob which just seems extra susceptible to the type of damage your best rain does, so, I think they're worth occasional experimentation.<br><br>POINT BLANK<br>They're impressive when you have enough targets, but you have to work to make them useful. I found that I didn't usually just &quot;happen across&quot; a situation that they'd be good for--I had to make those situations happen. But if you can get 6 mobs around you (and live through 6 mobs trying to kill you!), they can be amazing. I'm sure you've heard all about AE groups--they won't come for quite a while, but you there are occasional uses for PBs long before 50.<br><br>COLUMNS/PILLARS<br>I never go anywhere without one loaded. You should calculate the damage-mana ratio of your best DD and your best column when figuring out when to use what; but, often, a column will even win over your DD on only two targets, and it will get impressive on three or four.<br><br>Personally, I use AEs mostly to start a root-park, like this:<br>1) Pull of 2-4 comes in;<br>2) I wait a very short amount of time, just long enough that I'm pretty sure the main target will stay with the tank;<br>3) I fire the AE and immediately press escape to clear the target window;<br>4) One add hits me, and I root it... I back off, hit escape, root the next one, and so on.<br><br><br>The real short version is: Keep trying different things, and you'll find out what works for you. Usually, you'll want to talk to your group about what you're going to do so they aren't surprised. But, um... sometimes, you might want to NOT tell your group, so that they don't get all overexcited and think you're going to get them all killed. ;D<br><br>--Lyta<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujadrax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jadrax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/02 4:35:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15726.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Area Effect Spells </span><hr size=1> My AoE story.<br><br>First AoE i ever cast was in BB on some goblins, it was a piller spell. The group watched as all 3 goblins left the tank and came and killed me. I remeber when riding the boat back to get my corpse thinking that this did not seem a good plan. ;o)<br><br>Later on, I am level 18ish i think, in HH pass killing orcs. Some pasing wizardgod (must have been some over 30 type, had an SMR and everything.) tells me use your PBAoE on the orcs, and zone if you nuke to soon....<br>(NB: at this point i am nuking mobs as soon as they are pulled, the whole agro thing hasent really been explained to me yet, and wont be until i meet a level 50+ wizards alt in rathetear at level 20ish.)<br>So i am nuking the main mob, waiting a bit and then letting rip with my PBAoE (after i look up what the hell one is.)<br>It rocks, we are ripping through the orcs. I am going from hating AoE to loving it in a few hours.<br><br>I am level 30ish. i know a lot more stuff now, agro management is my art and craft. We are doing Giants in FM duoing them with a pally friend. My damage output needs upping, and i am going to try something new that i ahve only read about. I scribe the rain spell. I kill many Giants.<br><br>Of course, when you start getting the 50+ spells your world changes.<br>Tears of Druzzil (I STILL don't have Solsek yet /cry) rocks, the resists on it are noticable, ut it is still well worth usng once you find mobs velnerable to magic. (The Hole, Chardock, The Grey, Geonids in WL, Sents in WL.)<br><br>The 50+ PBAoE spells change the game totally, i havent done that many AoE groups but they are a total blast. (literally)<br><br>I don't Quad so i cant comment on the pillers, but people seem to like them.<br><br>And i nuked some rats in the warrens with al'kabor to check it still only hits 5 mobs past 50.

Best situation is a pull of 2, 2 tanks in group each taking one. In that case you can hit each mob twice. Very situational but nice to mem for some groups.<br><br>Cloumns/pillars - really nice for quading starting at 34 (see AE kiting forum). In xp groups it can be useful at low levels in unorganised groups, as when 3-4 dervs are pulled together with no chanter around. Wait a bit and cast, with a little luck you'll finish one, get aggro from healer to save the group, and maybe even survive. Not so efficient but fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>PBAoE - can be used as described above with a nice spell interrupt touch and more aggro on you.
