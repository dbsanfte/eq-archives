Second, where are you getting these 90% numbers from?  Sure, most of the time a group without an enchanter will scarf one up...  But enchanters don't grow on trees.  Ok clerics and warriors do kinda, but still, while you sit there getting no experience waiting for a perfect group to get set up, other people less concerned with being in the optimal group are having fun and getting experience.<br>
<br>
If you have skilled players, you can make lots of different combinations work, so long as you work together.  <br>
<br>
1.  Groups needn't have 6 players.<br>
2.  Groups <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> need</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> only one thing:  Damage.  They also need protection, usually this is tank/cleric, but anything that can keep you from getting killed is all you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> need</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
3.  Amendment to #2:  You also need mobs to kill.  A good group selects an appropriate hunting ground.  An inexperienced group of level 51's should not be trying to go deep into Sebilis.  You don't always have to hunt in the same place.<br>

<br>
Wizards are not geared for exp with respect to some other classes.  We're not able to solo effectively until 29, or at least I wasn't -- I tried, often.  And in a group, we're just not geared towards kill kill kill.<br>
<br>
As they say, the best defense is a good offense.  A tank to hold the mob, a cleric to heal the tank, a chanter to cast mana regen and serve as emergency croud control, and then 3 rouges forms a very strong offensive.  Wizards won't fit into that &quot;damage&quot; orientated group (at least nearly as well as say, a monk) simply because we're not long lasting.<br>
<br>
So either we accept this position, or we fight for better nukes / mana regen / mana efficiency.<br>

Most people aren't going to hang around a &quot;gimp&quot; group like this, like or hate it, people want max exp for their time. I can't see how you can even argue that one. And if they do hang around, the chances are very good that it's because they have nowhere else to go or nobody else to group with. <br>

<br>
You are correct, that numer IS most likely artifically low. Port around a few lvl 45+ dungeons, ask each group if they have an enchanter and get back to me on how I'm wrong there. I'm sure I'll be waiting a while. I make my own groups most of the time and the first thing people ask me is if I have an enchanter and a cleric yet, followed closely by, &quot;do you have a tank?&quot;. When I look to join a group the first thing I look for is an enchanter. If a group invites me to join, is going to be full with me in it, and we have no mana regen/haste, I'm going to weigh every possible alternative before joining that group. I'm sure I'm not alone there.<br>
<br>
 And the issue isn't whether we are effective in these situations, it is our desireability in the &quot;optimum group&quot; that we are talking about here. People don't start out looking for gimped groups, they will build the most efficient group they can first and foremost. So if you want to debate me on this point then show me how in most peoples minds a wizard is a viable pick for this kind of group. I'm interested on what server this mentality of accepting second best without first trying to win the race occurs as I am sure it must be quite the eutopia.<br>
<br>
So what do my above points imply and what effect does this have on us? Simple really, we aren't ever going to be a #1 choice for most groups in our current state. We might get the occasional pick up group but the chances of us being picked over a rogue or other high damage melee are slim. The point that is going to get us picked for most groups is our ability to snare and for this slot we compete with some 5 other classes. Perhaps once we see the full effects of the new sol skills that might change, but it's still going to require most of to travel a very long road to get to the point where we are a top pick.<br>
<br>
P.S. Don't bring up friendship and getting to know people as the answer because when we're talking about the issue of wizards getting groups, or not getting groups for that matter, we are talking about pick up groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucduckman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cduckman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/16/01 4:10:21 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Group a Wizard for Crying out Loud (Cleric's perspective</span><hr size=1> I don't know, sometimes &quot;fun&quot; pickup groups are the best for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
For instance, I hunted Treants for most of my 20's (damn evil trees!) in the NE corner of SK.  I'd rather be with a funny, talkative group than with an exp grind group much of the time, depending on my mood.<br>
<br>
<br>
One time, we had a chanter, two wizzies, and a tank in the group.  Needless to say we could burn both twees down in 20 seconds flat or less (with a 26 and a 28 level wizzie).  Regardless, we just had our chanter charm one.  Dueling treants!  While I know this isn't that inefficient (added about a min to the spawn time), the point is that we weren't going after the exp.  We had a great time.  That's what we wanted. =)<br>
<br>
That group was a lot of fun -- a lot of very funny people.<br>
<br>
/shout Tired of allergies?  You think that green crap in NK is the plauge?  Hell no!  It's tree pollen!  Come burn a tree today, the tree group needs more! =)<br>
<br>
<br>
Not to mention that I've made friends that way -- that I still talk to. =)<br>
<br>
<br>
Some people play this game purely to explore and see things and have the experience of getting new abilities.  Some people play this game due to, in a large sense, social reasons.<br>
<br>
Some like it mixed.  I'm one of them.  I want my new spells, but spending 30 minutes laughing while your group makes jokes and places bets on which treant will win is priceless.  Not to mention getting a few friends out of it in the process. =)<br>

..<br>
&quot;Most people aren't going to hang around a &quot;gimp&quot; group like this&quot;<br>
<br>
The people that leave the &quot;gimp&quot; group are no longer getting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  any</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> experience.  How does zero experience come out to be max xp for the time?<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to argue that you should forgo getting fast experience in the name of fun and friendship.  I am saying that having an optimally configured group is not something you can count on, and a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  good</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> group with a &quot;sub-optimal&quot; configuration can get more xp for their time than the war/clr/enc/rog/rng/shm group that sucks.  <br>
<br>
I wish I could find that elder death bunny post from Razamatazz Pizazz again.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Port around a few lvl 45+ dungeons, ask each group if they have an enchanter and get back to me on how I'm wrong there. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->What 45+ dungeons?  The Hole?  Oh wait, there are no groups in there, everyone is sitting LFG at the zone in Karnors and Sebilis.  Velkators?  It's funny.. there are groups on the groung level fighting over spawns while trying to optimize their group for a fast constant-pull situation that won't happen in the overcrowded zone.  I was this group once:  War/clr/enc/dru/mag/rog  Enchanter had to leave, and we added a wizard and our pull speed stayed the same, but now wee were killing much more quickly.  The group with the wizard was much more suited for that particular situation.<br>
<br>
What other 45+ dungeons?  Sol B?  Well, there are some monks soloing in there.  They don't have enchanters in their groups.  There's a mage in there soloing too.  Oh hey, it's me farming teal mobs (Killed 11 of them in less than 30 minutes.. which was cool since I was only logged on for about 45).<br>
<br>
Sebilis?  Most groups probably have an enchanter or a bard if they're moving in.  I won't disagree that enchanters are probably the most powerful class in all of kunark and the old world, but it's not because of clarity and haste, it's because of mez.<br>
<br>
Listen, I've played my mage to 55, and been in groups of all shapes and sizes.  Some have been successful, some haven't been.  One thing I can say for sure, however, is that an enchanter is not a requirement for getting a lot of xp in any situation, nor is having an enchanter/cleric/warrior a guarantee that things will work out well.<br>
<br>
Getting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  some</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> xp right now is always better than getting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  none</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> right now in the hopes that you might get into some perceived theoretically optimal group later on.<br>
<br>
Lets say that that &quot;gimp&quot; group of 5 averages 35 kills an hour, and groups for three hours.  They get 105 kills in their three hours.<br>
<br>
You wait around for a better group to form up, and an hour later manage to get into heaven.. that's right, the purely optimal melee xp group.  Your group has a false start, because the &quot;gimp&quot; group is already entrenched in their camp spot.  But eventually, you manage to settle into a good grind and pull off 50 kills per hour for the next two hours for a total 100kills.<br>
<br>
So, lets look at those three hours and see who has gotten more xp for their time.<br>
<br>
Group 1:<br>
<br>
7 kills per hour, per person.<br>
<br>
You over the same period of time:<br>
<br>
100kills/3hours/6people = <br>
<br>
5.5556 kills per hour, per person.<br>
<br>
The &quot;gimp&quot; group that is going at the sluggish rate of 35 kills per hour(compared to the uber 50 kills per hour of your optimal group) came out ahead of you, beacuse you sat around waiting for a better group.<br>

From a Rogues perspective Wizzies are a great addition to any group, provided you can convince your group of this. Wizzies (at least on my server) have complained so much that people don't like to group with them. Luclin seems to have changed that. You NEED a caster in Maidens eye, mind worms MoBs have ungodly Armor class. Fully Buffed/hasted (255str Dance of the Blade, Epic haste, bard Haste) with an atk _well_ over 1200 I was missing 1/2 the time on worms, those times I did hit where usualy well below normal damage. Our second Rogue left and was replaced by a Wizzie, made all the difference in the world. We started moving through them like, well damn it, I can't think of anything right now!. <br>

Actually it's the combination of four of the five most powerful factors in high-level EQ combat: slow, haste, clarity, and mez.  (Healing is the fifth.)  Best haste in the game, best clarity in the game (bard clarity is more points / tick, but show me the bard who hits <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> every single tick</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->), second best slow in the game (and not second by very much), and by-far best crowd control in the game.  They'd never do it at this point, but IMO a it would be a large boost to game balance to take one of those four factors away from enchanters and give it to another class.  If wizards, for example, had clarity, while enchanters could only mez, slow, and haste, wizards would be much more likely to get in groups (while enchanters would be no less likely to), though the downside would be yet another &quot;required&quot; class in the fabled optimal XP group.<br>

Hence, as I said:<br>

Yes I understand, I am not either. I'm attempting to outline the attitude people have when they are in fact trying to build a good exp group.

<br>
Actually, I think the above poster made the best point about this issue. It's not any one ability of enchanters that make them so wanted in an exp group, it's the whole kit and kabootle of what they can bring to an exp group. Having said that, I want to make clear I am not saying enchanters should be nerfed in the least. 3 years after release is not the time to start a nerf of that magnitude. My point still stands, however, enchanters lock down 1 of the six available slots of a potential exp group 90% of the time.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And if they do hang around, the chances are very good that it's because they have nowhere else to go or nobody else to group with.&quot; <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yes, it happens... you get into situations where you don't have a cleric to rez you and an enchanter to mez your adds...  imagine that... are you going to cry about it or make the most of your situation?<br>
<br>
You want wizards optimized for the XP group...  Well, too f'n bad.  There are only 6 slots in a group.  If I wanted to play cookiecutterquest I'd write it myself and play it with my friends... but you know what?  It would suck because it would lack depth.  Optimal xp groups are boring, I utterly hate them.  I do like getting in a good and powerful group that can accomplish its goals, regardless of its configuration. Frankly...  for pure xp purposes I really have not seen the need for a cleric, in the right spot, a group with a good AC tank can easily have a druid using regrowth/skin as the main healer.  The extra damage the druid can deal via damage shields makes the rest of the group kill a lot faster.  Regens are keeping up the healing so there is never any downtime, and the group can slaughter blues like you wouldn't believe.  You know what?  I have seen a group like that before.  I don't remember what all the classes were, but what I remember was<br>
<br>
1.  Druid - main healer<br>
2.  Shaman - Haste/slow/pet/?<br>
3.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Necro</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - crowd control<br>
<br>
I don't remember what the rest of the group was, I think it was 3 of monk/rogue/wizard/mage but the druid claimed that it was hands down the fastest Sebilis xp he has ever gotten.  That's right.  No fucking enchanter.  No clarity, subpar haste, but because those &quot;sub-optimal&quot; classes actually tried to play their class their way rather than pretend to play a prime class they rocked.  The group probably would have sucked if the druid tried to play like a cleric, or if the Necro tried to play like an enchanter, if they were the kind of people that think the best way to build an xp group is with a claritied cleric complete healing an enchanter hasted warrior.<br>
<br>
Wizards are a powerful class.  Due to the high end melee item situation, and the mid-low end twinking problem, wizards seem a bit maladjusted at the moment.  However, what makes them powerful(the ability to do a large amount of damage quickly) isn't needed if you never do anything exciting.  The xp grind is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ONE SMALL FACET</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of this game.  If you want to be optimally tuned for the most boring way of playing the game, for gods sake don't play a wizard, you will never be happy with him.  Wizards will never be tuned to the point that they'll have a lock down for every group in the game.  It's basically unfair that enchanters have that now.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Yes I understand, I am not either.

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I'm not sure what you are saying here but you can check out this site for a good guide to the plethora of options and hunting grounds available for this level range.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->So, patronizing now are we?  I am quite aware that there is a range of hunting grounds available.  I also (though haven't played since luclin) notice that pickup groups don't tend to form in many of the viable 45+ zones, I pointed out the hole.  If people were really concerned with getting optimal xp, why aren't there more groups there taking advantage of the huge xp bonus the zone has?  On my server, the people that try to form their groups based on some formula can't usually handle the hole anyway, so I guess it's just as well.<br>
<br>
I mentioned velks because we were in a situation in that dungeon in which a wizard was the best possible choice for a group.  There was plenty of downtime for the wizard to med, but the actual fight length was probably only about 25-30 seconds or so, which is pretty good for a mid/low 50's group.<br>

Second, I honestly think people are very much mistaken about how much more optimal one group configuration is over another when it comes to class...  When I'm in a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> good</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> group that is looking to add members, we usually look at things in this order:<br>
<br>
1.  Level<br>
2.  Reputation<br>
3.  Class<br>
4.  Guild tag<br>
<br>
When I'm in a crappy group, it's because they took a badly equipped 51 warrior over a second 55 rogue because &quot;we need a tank.&quot;  Great.. the 51 warrior can't tank much better than the 55 rogue, and can't do any damage to boot.  I respond to things like this so often because I get sick and tired of having groups suck because people make stupid decisions based on this idea of an optimal xp group for all situations.<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm trying to say is that class is such a minor factor, that the fact that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> wizards</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> don't fit into this one ideal mold isn't something people should be so concerned about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ul1nd4r4.showPublicProfile?language=EN>L1nd4r4</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/17/01 2:31:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Group a Wizard for Crying out Loud (Cleric's perspective</span><hr size=1>   Wizards, druids, any caster that relys on nukes or slow DOTs to deal damage is nothing more than an xp leech in a typical tank/cleric centric group.

This translates to more mobs dead in less time.  If you want less experience, if you want to waste your time then invite a wizard.<br>

No harvest here. <br>

I agree it's no secret why there are so many druids and not enough clerics or enchanters to go around...but it's far from dull as you put it. Here's the thing: Some players have limited time and can't log on for seven-hour sessions, so a lot of players choose solo-capable classes. You play EQ for entertainment, and LFG is boring. In what other game is your entertainment so reliant on the availability of groups? <br>

<br>
Just try to think out of the box.<br>
<br>
We have roots, stuns, snares, (with epic self rune), and because we had to live for such a long time with aggro control there is no other class out there that can manage the aggro better.<br>
<br>
So what can I do? I can crowd control, or help other caster with roots. Same with stuns. Your chanter will love you when he gets beaten to dirt and you help him with a stun so he can get his mez off. Or the cleric that get beaten for a cheal. Cleric dont have to have an eye on the wizard because of bof. They just love us because they dont have to buff us up with symbol.<br>
<br>
And than sure nukes. When possible i use 1 rain and a nuke on the target, thats about 2.5k dmg in 6 seconds?<br>
<br>
We got now FT items, our familiar, bof, natural mana regeneration C2 and what not else. My mana bar is filling faster than i can nuke and i love it (with about 3.700 mana)<br>

Little story to just show how some people do think.<br>
<br>
Was in KC with friends....<br>
<br>
1) A monk<br>
2) A ranger<br>
3) A cleric<br>
4) A mage<br>
5) A wizard<br>
6) and me....<br>
<br>
That's right you are reading this correctly, 3 casters! The xp was rocking...then the cleric had to go, so we started looking for a replacement....got one, he show up, we grouped him. His first question was, <br>
<br>
&quot;So, what do we got?&quot;<br>
<br>
We all told him our lvls/classes...<br>
<br>
After he was given all the info, he disbanded...<br>
<br>
We asked &quot;Why?&quot; He said, now get this....he didn't like heavy caster groups, cause of the down time, and that he would have to heal us(casters that is). We was amazed at this to say the least...So, we started looking again, and got a shaman. He shows up, asks what we got, now we are wondering what he going to say? We tell him, and he goes, this blew us away...<br>
<br>
&quot;Cool, this will be more of a challage, I like groups like this, more to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
We, to say the least, was dumbfounded...and went on for another couple of hours grinding out the xp...and we never ran once. Root/parking adds, pets on adds, and we was in the RCY, with pulls from the LCY, and sometimes somethings from trains.<br>
<br>
<br>
So...my point is...you DO not need the 3 &quot;Main&quot; classes to have fun, and get xp. Work with what you got. Never give up, never surrender...fight the good fight...and all that rawrawraw crap...this is a GAME, if your not having fun(and xp grinding all the time, and powergaming, etc...is not fun in my oppinion) then why play?<br>
<br>
Never give up the fight for class balancing, but, don't let it keep you from having fun either.<br>
