Actually you do. Legally, and practically.<br>

The court has ruled that the government has no obligation to protect you.<br>

Realistically there is no way the police can get to you in time to save you from an aggressor.<br>
<br>
Legally and practically there is only one person with the obligation to protect you.<br>

You.<br>

Eschew that responsibility and you are at the mercy of happenstance and the will of others.<br>

Allow your family to die and it is not the governments fault.<br>
<br>
It is yours.<br>

Take responsibility for your life. Be a pacifist if you like, but then don't whine when your daughter is raped in front of you.<br>

The bad guys won't be obeying your gun control laws.<br>

Everyone I ever dated I bought a gun for. They won't die when it could have been stoped.<br>

&quot;As has been said, the majority of gun crimes occur because ordinary people have access to a firearm at the wrong time.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
As has been said yes, but not backed up, Gemlin has posted some good links. Go see the facts.<br>
<br>
&quot;And maybe, just maybe, people wouldn't be as likely to get themselves killed by some idiot who assaults them at gunpoint if they didn't have the false confidence of a gun in their hand.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Wait either guns are a threat or they are not. If they something one can only have 'false confidence' in, then why are they worthy of being controlled?<br>
<br>
The truth is guns work FINE. A automatic sidearm with 'safety rounds' hardly has to be aimed, even a paniced firing of a dozen rounds is very likely to have ONE hit which is all you need to knock an assailant down and for you to get away.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gun control, or lack thereof, has nothing to do with the Holocaust. Don't be an ass by using the murder of millions of innocents to promote your pet political agenda.&quot; - Torcer<br>
<br>
Lol it wasn't just Germany. Gemlin listed SOME of the history of gun control. I suppose you think it is coincidence that populations with arms don't tend to get oppressed by their governments and that it was ones that were disarmed that were the subject of purges? Like I said how much fun would it be for the Chinese police to go and dissappear a dissident if they had to risk getting shot each time?<br>
<br>
Torcer, you facts 1-4 do not address the issue.<br>
<br>
No one is shocked to find that guns are used to kill people<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
However the point which you are using those facts to defend is that removing guns will make people safer, which the evidence of countries like the UK and Australia refute.<br>

Put your money where you mouth is if you believe all this.<br>

Here we go: Berretta Model 92 used by the US Military as their primary sidearm, 9mm High Capacity Magazine(15 rounds).  High Capacity being defined as anything over 10.  I believe you Could find 20 round magazines for that particular weapon.  Also available for Civilian Purchase through normal channels(even the High Capacity magazines can still be purchased, Just not manufactured).  THIS is the Type of weapon he is talking about in his article.<br>
<br>
The M60 7.62mm machine gun is a lightweight, air-cooled, disintegrating metallic link-belt fed, portable or  tripod mounted machine gun with a cyclic firing rate of 550 rounds per minute.<br>
<br>
These are two entirely different classes of weapons so you quote from the article talking about how if a Person would have had a 15-20 round Semi-automatic Pistol they MAY have had a chance at coming out better(Note I said MAY as did the article), and now you claim he wants everybody to be carrying around 18 pound(not including amunition) Fully automatic Belt Fed weaponry?<br>
<br>
<br>
But please, answer just this One question, Why can't you own one if you want one?  Are you a criminal?  Are you Insane?  Do you have thoughts of hurting yourself And/Or others?  If the answer to all of those is NO then what is the problem with you owning this particular weapon?  Because you are afraid you MIGHT do something bad with it?  Has nothing to do the weapon.  If you mistrust yourself that much please seek professional help.  Or is it simply because NO one NEEDS it.  <br>
<br>
Well no one Needs alcohol either, you going to make that illegal too to protect me from myself?  Already happened didn't work.<br>

You will need mug shots taken, finger prints, and send off 200 dollars to the FBI for a criminal background check. You also need to fill out a form and have the local police chief/sherrif/marshal, etc sign. You will be allowed then to purchase a Class 2 firearm.<br>

What the assault rifle ban did, was make it so that a FULL AUTOMATIC assualt rifle is cheaper than a Semi automatic version.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 5.

<br>
<br>
Ever been to Canada, sparky? Guns aren't prohibited, they're controlled. I'm Canadian, but I guess you didn't realize that. I've owned firearms legally, and I've destroyed them. We even have our share of idiot gun nuts like Smartypus, who's also Canadian. His collection of firearms is perfectly legal.<br>
<br>
The difference is that guns are a lot harder to acquire in Canada, and that concealable and repeating firearms are illegal to have. In other words, no handguns, and no fucking machine guns.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as free speech goes? We've got much freer speech than you guys, buddy. You want an example, go read the editorials that get published in &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot;. There's some nitwit religious leader from Ottawa who's been publishing essays on why the Taliban and Al'Qaeda are good. Ever wonder what your FBI would do to somebody that published something like that in the US?<br>
<br>
Did you know that Canada has an active Communist party that runs in federal elections?<br>
<br>
Did you know that Canada has more religious and ethnic diversity than the USA?<br>
<br>
Did you know that the UN has rated Canada the best country to live (based on social freedom and rights) in every year for the last 4 years, and that we've been in the top 3 every year since the mid '60s?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you honestly believe that because I don't own a gun, my government is going to suppress anything I say? You are kidding, right? If I wanted to, I could stand on Parliament Hill at noon on July the 1st with a megaphone, and shout out about how Jean Chretien is a jackass. They wouldn't arrest me, either. Do you think they'd let you stand on Capitol Hill at noon on July 4th and shout the same things about Mr. Bush?<br>

The point isn't that the *current* Canadian or American governments might suppress anything you say.  The point is that some future government might try to, for whatever reasons.  Ultimately, the time might come where Canadians or Americans might have to fight their governments.  And if the citizens don't have guns, it's going to be a much harder fight.<br>

This is a meaningless statistic if the UN and I differ on the criteria for what makes a country &quot;best to live in&quot; (and we do).  Canadians work under a staggering taxload to pay for all of the social programs that the government funds.  I would consider that a huge strike against Canada.  Canada continues to redistribute the most federal funds to a province that consistently holds the rest of the country hostage by threatening to secede.  These things, among others, put Canada much further down the list of desirable countries to live in on my scale.  So only if I share the same point of view as the UN is this statistic at all meaningful.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Brahma Atman

&quot;. The law, which took effect Dec. 1, requires all three million gun owners to be licensed, and every one of the estimated seven million rifles and handguns in Canada to be registered. Sales or gifts of easily concealed pistols are banned, though current owners can keep the ones they have, and officials are given broad discretion to deny licenses and to search homes for weapons. &quot;<br>
<br>
Thats right...you cant even purchase a concealable piston.  If you have a gun, you can be banned from having them just for no reason by a government official.  They dont have to give you any reason, especially you asshole.  No license no gun, even if the government cannot give you a reason to deny you one - they just feel like it.<br>

&quot;Meanwhile, the Saskatoon Star Phoenix is under attack from the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission for publishing an advertisement that consisted of Biblical verses on homosexuality and a cartoon figure depicting a circle and red slash -- the universal symbol of something forbidden -- superimposed on two men holding hands. Likewise, the liberal Toronto Star is currently under investigation by the Ontario Human Rights Commission for allegedly violating the ban on discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin in the Ontario Human Rights Code, by refusing to publish a lengthy letter to the editor by a former president of the Canadian Polish Congress, Toronto District.&quot;<br>

Yep, looks like the provincial governments of Canada is investigating some newspapaers, since they are not conforming to what the government deems politically correct.<br>

&quot;The Supreme Court in Canada will rule on whether a Christian college that disapproves of homosexuality may train teachers for Canadian public schools.<br>
<br>
The case involves Trinity Western University (TWU) and the British Columbia College of Teachers (BCCT) in 1996 and may set a historic precedent concerning religious freedoms in Canada.<br>
<br>
The teacher-training program at TWU, a Christian school 20 miles east of Vancouver, was first denied full accreditation by BCCT in 1996. BCCT said TWU's stance that homosexuality is a sin amounted to discriminatory practice. BCCT warned that even though the program met all academic qualifications, teachers trained at TWU might discriminate against homosexual students.<br>
<br>
In September 1997, the British Columbia Supreme Court ordered BCCT to approve TWU's application for accreditation. BCCT appealed, and in 1998 the British Columbia Court of Appeals found again that BCCT's decisions to deny TWU accreditation &quot;reflect an error in law and are factually and patently unreasonable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Guy S. Saffold, TWU executive vice president, says the Supreme Court ruling holds a great deal of significance for religious institutions in North America. &quot;This case is about Christian people's religious right to maintain their beliefs and not be excluded because of them,&quot; Saffold says.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you can't train teachers because you disapprove of homosexuality, can you be a teacher if you disapprove of homosexuality? Can you be a doctor or a lawyer or a judge?&quot; TWU expects a hearing date in the fall of 2000 or early 2001.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bottom line...yes there is free speech in Canada as long as your views are in line with the governments.  Screw you if yours are not in line with the governments.  You will be investigated, discredited, discriminated against by the government, etc.  because you hold different views.  Doesnt sound like diversity or openmindedness to me.<br>
<br>
Well...next time think before you post.  But somehow your previous post shows your probably incapable of that.<br>

The only possible reason for you to want a concealable firearm is to perform a criminal act. If you are not intending to break the law with your firearm, you don't need to hide it. That, in itself, invalidates your argument.<br>

So, you openly admit to wanting to propagate hate literature against a group in society? What is it about anti-gay literature that's so different from anti-black, anti-jew, or anti-suffrage/women's lib literature? At its fundament, there's absolutely no difference between them, so why are you so quick to defend one group while you're not defending the others?<br>
<br>
We're simply defending the rights of homosexuals and other individuals under our charter of rights and freedoms. Canada is progressive that way.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">read it here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Two very important sections in that charter that you clearly haven't read....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 15. (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 24. (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

<br>
Read the above two quotes from the Charter of Rights and Freedoms again. The bottom line is, in fact, that free speech in Canada is guaranteed, as long as your free speech does not infringe on the rights of other individuals.<br>

<br>
it seems that the person i was 'discussing' with couoldn't talk without personal insults ect, sorta sad <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
this person decided  that guns are bad because guns kill people and children<br>
<br>
my only response was people killed people, adn lots of things kill children, esp irresponible adults, its sad but its not an impliments fualt, its the adult's fault<br>
<br>
and as to why would i want a concealable weapon? to protect my family and myself<br>
<br>
just because some one would like to cary a gun, doesn't mean they like to advertise it<br>
<br>
why would i want an assalt rifle or other such weaponry?<br>
its one of those CYA things...what if  we are forced to defend ourselves because of extenuating circumstances? <p>Illegal javascript event tags or url parameters detected.</p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4>Rant Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.7<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
