<br>
The first time I was asked to join Relentless Ascension (before RA and HF merged into what is your current guild), was a few days after Khlore dinged 46 in Sol B. The most recent time was a couple of months after you joined, when Kolasie /tells me &quot;I'm not going to stop spamming you until you join my guild.&quot;<br>
<br>
You're damned right &quot;I could go there but I don't really want to.&quot; I'm loyal, maybe to a fault, and I'm quite happy where I am. If you think it's a front, ask Eonwe or Kolasie if they ever spoke with me recently about joining FE. I'm proud of working my way up from wiping to moss snake caliber encounters to cleaning out Dain, KT, Yel, part of North wing, and assorted other IV/RoO/etc stuffs in a single day. I'm quite secure knowing that I watched the majority of the players on MT grow, including the majority of your guild members, and I know exactly where I stand and what kind of player I am. If anyone's jealous, it's you obsessing over my picture. Obviously I'm not self-conscious about it, or you wouldn't have the URL, einstein. And have you taken a look in the mirror... ever? The searing irony of your fat ass attempting to ridicule anyone's photo is worthy of a rant in and of itself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uunclemustardhat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>UncleMustardHat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/5/02 12:26:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1354.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Annoying ass rotations..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> FCFS is the best way. it rewards those that try, are determined and diligent.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There are many guilds that will kill a big mob, just because they can.  They're &quot;raid&quot; guilds, that's practically all they do.  It doesn't matter that all their wizards, mages, etc. have their epic; it doesn't matter that they all have Velious or better leggings.  They're going to kill VS because they already killed Cursed, HP, IV, Rumble, Emperor Crush and Lord Runnyeye.<br>
<br>
How about guilds that are the first ones there, but get leapfrogged?  &quot;Thanks for drawing that drolvarg's attention, we'll take it from here.&quot;  This is especially a problem with MB teams; yeah, I'm sure they could've cleared to Trak by themselves.  The people holding off Prot/Tola just weren't quick enough.<br>
<br>
The problem here is that people are racing in the first place.  Very few mobs present any challenge for the raidforce, even a half-assed raidforce can do tons of &quot;big&quot; encounters.  This leaves *anyone* who is not under the direction of an experienced leader out in the cold.  Wanna learn/see/do big stuff?  Sorry, gotta leave that gimpy guild and come with us. <p>-----<br>

/laff  You are frelling clueless.  I have only been in a raiding guild for a short time, but i can assure you, no one is itching to go kill VS just because he is up and everything big is already dead.  People have better things to do with their time (*cough* get more AA *cough*) than kill a mob from 3 expansions ago out of boredom.<br>
<br>
I am so glad i am on Veeshan where there is no stupid rotation.  If you want a mob you damned well mobilize and go get it.  You don't whine about how it is your &quot;turn&quot; or how you &quot;deserve&quot; a mob.  You just send a call out to your friends and go for it.  If someone beats you, you suck it up and try again the next time.  I was in a tiny RP guild for a long time.  There was no way we could field a force large enough to complete anything harder than the rogue epic, and even that required help from our friends in other guilds.  Did i whine about how all the uberguilds were not playing fair and letting me get my epic?  No i lived with the fact that my guild was not advanced enough to do it.  The friends in my guild were more important to me than any virtual staff.  When you play basketball do you get free points when you can't make the hoop?  Jeebus.<br>

/boggle.  Of course you need an experienced, reliable raid leader to successfully raid.  They don't grow on trees you know.  The organization and leadership is what makes a good raid force, not sheer numbers.  If you are in a low powered guild, of course you will never see the &quot;big stuff.&quot;  That is the way EQ is designed.  The choice you make is YOURS.  Do i want to stay here in my &quot;gimpy&quot; guild (this is the choice i made until there was literally no one left in my previous guild) with my friends, and recognize the fact that my guild is not as capable as others, or do i want to tell them it is time for me to move on, because i have things to do in EQ that won't get done with them.  You can't have it both ways. <p>Luxum Aeturnum {Cestus Dei}<BR>

Inny has two guilds that have killed Emp Ssra and 3 more working on it. One of the emp killing guilds recently returned to NToV for the first time in months to try and get Ancient spells. Do you honestly believe that they have nothing better to do then camp VS just to kill him because they can? These types guilds do things for a reason. Granted you will have members that farm but they exist on every server and in every guild (to some extent).<br>
<br>
FYI, to get into VT sometimes they have to kill RC. Do you think they are going to wait a several hours for some sloth rotation guild to get their ass into gear and kill it? no.<br>

nice, &quot;if's&quot; and &quot;but's&quot;. Did you read what I said? Most guilds respect when you beat them or you cut a deal. Those that dont and try to KS usually never get very big because their rep is in the toilet.<br>

why is racing a problem? because things aren't handed to you?<br>
<br>
no offence but you dont know what your talking about. Your argument is based off of sepculation on the worst case senerio. Let me give you some truths... There is a mid-level guild on Inny that killed Phinny for the first time. They recently started doing PoF/PoH and most of the members are low 50's. This guild is lead by a pretty sharp lvl 52 pally and they will go places. why? They dont wait for their turn to get better, they make it happen. 3 months ago my guild could barley kill kunark dragons. now we are farming broods and killing Tormax/CT/Statue. why? we didnt wait to get better, we made it happen.<br>
<br>
If a guild wallows whos fault is it? the guilds or the servers because there was no rotation to feed them loot? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucamrael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>camrael</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_yellowspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/5/02 7:40:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1354.topic&index=25>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Annoying ass rotations..</span><hr size=1> We have a calendar system on Bertox for Fear, Hate and Sky that actually makes:<br>

1) People have fake guilds so they can book the plane for more than 1 x 24 hour period in a day.<br>
<br>
2) Forces people who play a lot but who need a fear epic piece (Shaman, Warriors, and Enchanters) to wait up to a year (which in a game that will only last 4 years is wrong) to even see their mob<br>
<br>
3) People sneak in and get their epic pieces, some get caught, most don't<br>
<br>
4) The planes are so old and outdated that the uber guilds would simply farm their epic pieces and lower guilds could get fear armour anytime they wanted...<br>
<br>
5) Finally, the calendar system also means some guilds don't take their slots, and stuff pops and stays up longer than it should meaning less named mobs over time.<br>
<br>
I can see sometime this year the calendar system going away when 5 major guilds say enough is enough. <p><a href='http://www.avvisione.com'><img border="0" src="http://www.avvisione.com/members/cam.jpg" alt='Click to visit Avvisione.com'></a>

Perhaps it is simply that everything in this game worthwhile is surrounded by the fact you need 6-60 people to get most of it done. I guess that is one major flaw about this game that has always bugged me, to get anywhere or most anything you are unable to do it alone. Guilds are a good thing for sure, but I would like to see more things, except baking and tailoring, that a player could do on their own.<br>

Now.. we won't leapfrog you, and if you were there first and are trying the mob for the first time, you'll get your shot, but if you screw it up we're going to kill it first then help you rez.  (At least this is how we've always done it).  <br>

Also, when it comes to sharing spawns it really helps to be in good standing with us.  Instead of &quot;wait for you to get your chance, then we move in and kill,&quot; we'll quietly move out or offer assistance.<br>

I'll also say that killing 5 bosses in a day doesn't happen too often.  I mean, you go read Tritons website and it seems like they are going around ganking bosses 24/7, but it really just seems that way because a weeks worth of news is typically condensed into a single story.

<br>
Epic mobs on rotation are just headaches. Rotations between the few guilds that want to do ntov and all agree theres no point to going in when 2 clones and every flurry drake is spawned work.<br>
<br>
FCFS will get the dominant guilds their items first (the most dominant shouldnt even need the items any more, twinks getting vs are few and far between, and if you leave shissar up for a few days, its your fault if we go in and get him for a main) and leave the rest of the spawns to the other guilds.<br>
<br>
Rotations make survival of the fittest to survival of who can be less bored. It probably makes for fewer targets for the guilds who are not in the top tier, forcing viable targets (kunark dragons, trak, vs) to be set to a certain guild, who would more then likely only get one kill a year unless they got lucky. <p><div align="center"><i>Play to win.

Well I do.<br>
<br>
Just because YOU don't recognize a guild does not mean it does not exist.  Aven thoroughly checks out the guilds and there is a wait time while he makes sure that the guild does indeed exist.  The calendar system has worked well from day one and it gave the up and coming guilds chances they would not ordinarily not have.<br>
<br>
It gets removed then it removes ALL chances for those guilds to go and have a shot at their armor and epic pieces and it will be far worse than ragefire on Bert currently is.<br>
<br>
Be very careful what you ask for. <p>Alyssandra Blackthorne, 60 Wizard<BR>
