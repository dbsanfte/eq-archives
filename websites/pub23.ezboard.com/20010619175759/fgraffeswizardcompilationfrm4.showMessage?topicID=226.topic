It's possible I guess, but what happens to the class that we displace?  A group can only hold 6 players.  If wizards become better than one of the preferred classes now, what is that class to do?  <br>
<br>
Let's play with the board's favorite for a sec, the rogue.  What if all the sudden VI comes along and gives wizards uber mana regen and better nukes so that now we can outdamage rogues in a standard exp group.  Now group dynamics swing to our favor and we all get groups rather quickly while rogues struggle to get into any groups because they have been stealth nerfed by our sudden increase in power.  I mean, using the regular board arguments, why have a rogue when a wizzy can do as much damage, needs little healing, can evac out, and do crowd control in a pinch?  What exactly can a rogue do without a group?  Nothing...  Pretty much it for them.  This same scenario can be played with a number of other classes that really can't solo.   If wizards/mages/necros/druids come and displace them, what will happen to those classes?<br>
<br>
You think being a wizard is tough now, what would you do if you couldn't solo high greens, let alone blues?  That's pretty much what you'll be doing to these displaced classes.  There will always be a finite number of groups on any server, this creates a finite number of possible spots in these groups and allocates a total number, again finite, of players who can gain exps that way.  Replacing classes that don't solo well or can't solo at all with classes that can will effectively stop any chance those classes have of gaining exps.  This will cause lots of attrition in those classes and really make the balance of classes much, much worse.  <br>
<br>
Does this really sound like the right way to fix wizards? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uronos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ronos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/23/01 2:54:00 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on grouping...</span><hr size=1> Interesting point.<br>

I look at what VI has done so far and feel it will never happen and once they are balanced to what one likes then another will say they are not. Its an endless cycle. Personally I, if I was designing the classes I would take the base line model of a warrior and strip everything down to that. Then go and define each class. Build them to that. Once built test them then once fixed say this is it, here they are. Let them play it for a week or so, then offer a class change to those who want it.<br>

This then creates a spiral of increasing abilities to maintain group attraciveness.  So you make wizards more group friendly, able to dish out damage like a rogue with little down time.  Now rogues and warriors get displaced in group, so they have to solo.  So VI has to increase melee's ability to survive a solo fight.  If they increase their damage, they'll once again displace wizards.  So wizards will have to be upped.  If they increase melee defensively, then clerics get displaced, because tanks don't need to be healed often.  For every action here, there's a reaction.  <br>
<br>
Pretty soon you will totally lose class interdependency.  Of course, this is the only way to make all classes equally desired to groups.  EQ isn't setup like that at all, and never will be.  VI likes having clerics and tanks depend on each other.  Being able to solo isn't part of vision, so it won't happen.  <br>
<br>
As a few of you know, I'm part of the DAoC beta and they do things a bit differently.  All classes can solo in DAoC.  This makes grouping a snap.  The classes aren't all in the game yet and the combat system is still being worked on but the corner stone that makes it work is the ability to take care of yourself in a fight.  I really can't see EQ taking this approach this late in the dev cycle.  So if you are really serious about having groups all the time, make a cleric or chanter or get DAoC when it comes out.  Waiting for VI to make your wizard the must have class for a group won't, and probably shouldn't, ever happen.<br>

Nothing could be further from the truth.  What you need to do is design them and the game in such a way that you can have real VARIETY of class abilities in a group that will be useful, attractive, and fun.<br>
<br>
Everquest is about killing an endless parade of different shaped creatures.  To that end, there are only so many ways you can make a class kill things and help others kill things.  Thus we end up with 14 classes, of whom only about 4 really are that great at the game, and the rest sort of fill out slots in the roster.  It is a fault of Everquest that cannot be repaired because of their terror someone might, just MIGHT get advancement or experience or money without butchering something.<br>
<br>
That said, however, you CAN make adjustments to classes to make each one more group-friendly.  The balance must be understood in the light of another post I did about in- and out-of-combat utility.  Being great in combat can be so useful it negates any noncombat ability while still being a good and attractive class (Warriors).  Being wonderful out of combat while having virtually no ability IN combat makes you trash (Rogues before fixing).<br>
<br>
Soloing is something people are going to do with whatever they can however they can.  It is a fact that Verant I think FINALLY has come to grips with.  Even Rogues can solo, I have done it with mine, its just hard and slow.  The fact that someone can solo has no, absolutely NO bearing on their grouping balance.  It is a separate issue to be dealt with separately.  The fact I can get xps without a horde of people around me doesn't make me better than another class who cannot do so.  It makes me DIFFERENT, and while the ability is attractive, the way to balance that is to give the other class abilities that are attractive other than grouping.  This does NOT mean that it has to be soloing.<br>
<br>
For example, Enchanters are probably the poorest INT caster class for soloing, stories of charmed chains of monsters or not.  However, that isn't a problem for the class because they are superior in grouping AND have many non-combat, non grouping abilities that make them attractive anyway.  That is the focus and the way Verant needs to go.<br>
<br>
Quite honestly, adding almost ANYTHING to a class makes it solo better.  Ask the monk with 75% bandage and feign death.  Ask the rogue with snare poison and instill doubt.  Ask the paladin with stun and fear.  The fact is, people are creative and come up with wonderful new tactics.  Ordinary GMs, at least good ones see this and go &quot;wow, that's cool!&quot; not &quot;damn the exploiting bastards!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
So adding any ability that MIGHT make a class solo better shouldn't be even a medium concern of Verant for balance, the primary concern should be how enjoyable it will be, how well it fits the game, and whether it is unbalanced in terms of raw power.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, that whole interdependency thing is a pile of reasty crap.  Tanks depend on casters out of combat (ports, invis, binds) and casters sometimes depend on tanks in combat (tanking).  But tanks don't need casters at ALL in combat (non healers), and casters don't need tanks in combat really (kiting, etc).  The fact is, Verant had a vision that was weak on paper and destroyed rapidly in actual gaming.  They have got to shake loose from this idea.<br>
<br>
Personally I think the best way to BUILD a game is to make everyone able to solo if they want.  There are a host of good reasons for it, and despite Verants paranoid antisocial fantasies, people WILL group even if you don't hammer them over the head to force them too.  In fact, if you feel the pressing need to see people group, the way to do it is to encourage people to do so with benefits in grouping, like xp bonus, rather than forcing them to. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www,kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg BORDER=0> at: 5/23/01 12:15:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uberylshadowhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beryl Shadowhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/23/01 7:29:17 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.unlv.edu/faculty/engstrom/images/bcard.jpg WIDTH=149 HEIGHT=175></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on grouping...</span><hr size=1> Well, now you see what I'm saying, Grim.  There's no way VI is ever going to make every class more or less equal in and out of groups.  Anyone out there who continues to hold onto the belief that somewhere down the road there'll be a patch that gives wizards a free pass to group is delusional.  The second wizards become a group's favorite some other class who used to be a groups favorite will scream they were nerfed and have to be fixed.  We don't play the game in a vacuum, anything that makes wizards better in group makes some other class worse.<br>
<br>
This all leads back to the things I always say.  Verant isn't going to make wizards any more attractive to a group than they are now.  So wizards have to play smarter and by our own rules.  Form AoE groups and quad-kite until you make 60.  AoE groups are very addictive, people will come back for more.  Keep at it long enough and you'll never have to look for one, they'll form up and come looking for you.  They used to hound me when I didn't start the AoE group up.  Rombus' guild was especially bad about chasing me down for AoE, heh.<br>
<br>
You use that term a lot, Goanad.  I don't think it means what you think it does.  Anyone who thinks that it's right to fix wizards by making another class suffer is a class &quot;A&quot; jerk.  You sure that's the position you want to take?  If you can't see what's wrong with your line of thinking I think I know why you can't get into groups and it has nothing to do with playing a wizard.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www,kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/24/01 7:24:20 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/grimtoo.jpg  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on grouping...</span><hr size=1> Well, since Verant is, as we speak, testing something to make Wizards more group-friendly, I'd say your contention that they'll never do so seems unlikely, at best.<br>
<br>
&quot;There's no way VI is ever going to make every class more or less equal in and out of groups.&quot;<br>
<br>
The problem is, I never said they had to.  Just that they had to make everyone equally attractive to pick for a group, and that combat/noncombat skills had to be considered differently.  Teleports are a really nice noncombat skill, but they do NOT make up for lacking in combat (say, if Wizards had Enchanter-level offense and teleports).  That's the thing to keep in mind for them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoanad.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goanad</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/24/01 9:25:50 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on grouping...</span><hr size=1> I use that term alot in conjunction with you because everytime you open your hole you are apologizing and making reasons for VI justifying where the Wizard class is and why we can't possibly be justified in wanting a change in the status quo. <br>
<br>
You are an extremely biased apologist. From your uberguilded, level 60 perch, you pontificate to the &quot;peons&quot;(ie, anyone lower than you) about why they need to just shut up and take it in the kiester from VI. <br>
<br>
As a matter of clarification Beryl, I never have mentioned that I have a problem getting groups. I don't experience problems in finding a group because people I befriend know my characters as being charitable and helping in nature. I'm the chanter that goes zone to zone on my travels giving breeze, and soon clarity, to anyone I see free of charge. Sure, I set up shop now and then to take donations, but by and large, things like that are free. I play my wife's druid on the computer next to me and I'll sow people for free if they need it-no questions asked. <br>
<br>
So Beryl, don't go painting me, or anyone else, as a social misfit miscreant unless you know it for a fact. <br>
<br>
In the great final analysis it really does bug you that &quot;iv'e got your number&quot; and I see you clearly for what you are-an apologist. <br>

Sometimes VI does make a good change for us, lures, harvest and banes being notable.  I know you've waited a long time for this, too, so good luck.<br>
<br>
Now on to Goanad's post.  I'm sure you're just the nicest guy in the game.  I just haven't ever seen you post a friendly thought, so it could just be a coincidence. <br>
<br>
I'm not a VI apologist, I'm a wizard zealot, although you might not be able to see the difference through that VI hating haze.  I think wizards are a great class, always have.  I knew that everytime I logged on I could get good exps unlike many other classes.  I've always told VI what changes I'd like to see in the class, and they actually did some, but I never let myself get hungup on them not implementing something I wanted, I'd just play and have fun with the spells I had.  I wouldn't have played the game for 2 months, let alone two years if I wasn't having fun.<br>
<br>
You think you know how you should play your wizard.  I know how I should play mine.  The fact that I play mine in a much different way than yours, in fact a way you probably never have tried, and got to 60, in and of itself might make you want to look at what you are doing.  If you don't enjoy your wizard and I enjoy mine so much, what do you have to lose by changing?  Your misery?  <br>
<br>
It's not pontification, it's education, there is a difference.  I didn't just start talking about these things this week, I've been pushing wizards to change how they play the game since I was a level 30-something back in '99.  You don't have to quad or AoE group, but don't tell me that's the wrong way to play.  Both are the best ways to play the game, for fun and advancement.  Many wizards now use these tactics to great effect and more try them everyday.  So there just might be something to them.<br>
<br>
Wizards aren't getting ripped by VI nearly as bad as they are by ignorance.  The posts about rogues doing more damage than wizards alone should tell you that.  The day that three rogues, a cleric, a chanter and a bard can kill every mob between the seb zone out and chef's in under 60 secs, then you can say they can out-damage wizards.  The fact that people still cling to these ignorant beliefs are what keep wizards out of groups.  Why do people still think this?  Because half the wizards are in here saying the same stupid thing!  You have to stop playing the game the way the melee play it, afterall you're not melee, you're wizards.  You have to start getting people into AoE groups to see the light.  Wizards can't shine if the people playing them don't show the other players what we can do.  We even have a forum now discussing the who, how, and where's of AoE grouping, but I swear to god, some of you still won't go read it.  Why?  I have no idea.  Maybe it's just easier to sit on your butt waiting for intervention than to get up and go try something new that works.  <br>

My hottest flames go to the apologists. I really don't think those folks really care much about the class at all. That's the bottom line. Why else would you want to have constructive criticism cease? They certainly do. <br>
<br>
Believe it or not I understand what you are saying completely. You are trying to get wizards to see that there is both entertainment and a challenge to playing your wizard in a manner different from the norm. I've read many things you and others have had to say about AOE and Quading and my only input on that is that it shouldn't be used as an excuse for VI not to fix us so that we can stay on an equitable keel with respect to mainstream play and tactics. Remember, not everyone is so inclined, as we are, to analyze and pursue creative problem solving to reach the supposed wizard nirvana that you and others have written about. They just want to sit down when they get home from work, find a group, shoot the breeze, kill some stuff, and not be called a uncreative dullard because they can't put the time into becoming a creative tactician like you and I can. <br>
<br>
You know, and to cut this short, if we could get VI to move &quot;an inch&quot;...and I mean really do something substantive for wizards, I think we could move the attractiveness for wizards the proverbial &quot;mile.&quot; But time and again they have insulted Wizards as a class and used pitiful tactics of placation. If they could find it in themselves to do some real relationship improvement with our class, then you'd find more people willing join the ranks of &quot;Wizard Zealots.&quot; <br>
<br>
Right now....we have to see what Graffe and VI have been talking about with respect to making the class more group friendly. IF it's real and not another act of insult or placation, then perhaps things will improve. I hope so. I really do. <br>

Wizards are supposed to do huge amounts of damage compared to warriors, but based on the better and better items given to melee classes, that's no longer the case.  <br>
<br>
If the spells we were given were upgraded with each expansion, and there were rare-drop spells that were as rare as the uber-items are, then there wouldn't be a problem. For every uber weapon and piece of armor, there should be a caster spell that drops that does for the caster what the item does for the melee.  That's all, we don't want vendor sold 5000HP DD spells, but we DO want to see spells that do for us what the armor and weapons do for others.  <br>
<br>
Oh, they get a haste sword?  Then why not give us DD spells with a 2 second casting time but the same damage?  Oh, there's a 40 damage, 30 delay sword that procs?  Well, now there's a 3k damage spell that drops that costs 500 mana.  Something like this is balanced.  Something that Verant doesn't understand.<br>

<br>
Maybe make Wizards at least EQUAL to Rogues? Heh? We were supposed to be the masters of damage. Now we became the Masters of Teleporting and resists and fizzles and trying to avoid death... our own death.<br>
<br>
I don't get you? So because Rogues have to get into a group we have to pay threfore? I don't agree.<br>
Make Rogues and Wizards as reliable and the group can choose whom, they need more.<br>
If they have already and evacer snarer, the'll choose the Rogue. If they want a Nuker, Stunner.. a BURNER, then they'll choose the Wiz. Because both should be balanced against each other.<br>

   Is Beryl right on this point?  Well, maybe, for her, she is.  Maybe she doesn't rely on pick-up groups.  I've grouped for most of my wizard's career, but reputation isn't everything when it comes to getting into a group.  Whether she wants to admit to it or not, it's also the WIIFM principle (&quot;What's in it for me?&quot;)<br>
<br>
    As can be gleamed from reading these boards for all of 5 minutes is what a wizard usually brings to a group is added downtime and it's this problem that needs to be adressed.<br>

Make wizards just as attractive as rogues to a group.  Half the groups choose wizzies, half choose rogues.  What are those rogues that would have been in the wizzy groups going to do now?  Unlike wizzies, they can't port out quickly to look for another group or go solo some decent exps.  They either take a long walk, beg a port, or risk dying solo with a lot of down time for some marginal exps.  <br>
<br>
So what will the rogues do?  Cry nerf.  Now VI has to either make rogues viable outside normal groups or nerf us back out of those groups.  Ideally, we'd say make rogues better outside the groups, like wizards are, so we can all be happy.  Trick of that is, how to you improve them without wrecking the new found balance in group?  Make them harder to kill outside a group, they will be harder to kill inside group and make them more attractive than us again.  Give them more offense and they become more attractive in group as well.  See the problem?<br>

<br>
If a group needs a mana independent damage dealer with high AC and decent HP, they will take the rogue.<br>
If they need the Nuker and Evcaer they will take the Wizard - knowing that he has to med from time to time.<br>
<br>
I don't know, i can imagine Rogues AND Wizards in the same group.<br>
<br>
I don't think we should step back in favor for the ROgues. that isn't our role, never was and hopefully won't be in the future. Atm tho, it is our role. Even a group in Sebilis will most likely (if they don't do PLA) take the rogue over the Wiz. Constant, fast and massive damage.<br>
<br>
Again, i think WIzards and Rogues can coexist, even if Wizards would get a moajor upgrade.<br>
<br>
At the moment we are the step child to give Rogues a reason for their existance?<br>
<br>
That's a little too much imo.<br>
<br>
No Rogue would suffer if they would improve Wizards to make us more attractive to groups again.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
<br>
On the other hand and watched from a very different angle:<br>
<br>
Beryll touched a wound point somewhere. The cash flow point. There were allways more people playing Meleers than certain casters. (Note: i said 'certain' caster, not casters in general.) I am pretty sure Verant has some marketing analysis runnig as well out there. And those analysis will tell them, that a lot of people prefer to play Meleers than Wizards. Of course it's a spirale. Casters are so unattractive atm, that for sure the melee option looks by far like more fun.<br>
<br>
Did you note that certain classes get constantly, patch for patch, expansion for expansion major upgrades while other classes are left behind? Verant is playing a dangerous poker game imo, to increase their cash flow. This never ever leaded to something good in the past and won't do any good in the future. Other companies are aware of the mistakes Verant made... Be sure of that.<br>
<br>
What i want to say... in lack of time and money investment to make the game better, to improve the game mechanisms and balace, - what is the easiest solution? The cheapest? To let some class bleed in favor for other classes. Some not so much desired class. And that are we... the Wizards.<br>
An easy fix for other classes and we are paying... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/unatanmagus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Natan Magus</A> at: 5/26/01 4:32:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www,kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/26/01 8:22:58 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/grimtoo.jpg  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on grouping...</span><hr size=1> Here's the difference: Rogues will be consistent, long term damage.  I have no problem with being outdamaged OVER A LONG TIME because my job isn't do to huge damage forever.  My problem is being outdamaged quickly because my job IS to burn fast.  And rogues can easily do this for two reasons:  Need to conserve mana and need to control aggro.  Since a rogue not only is able to withstand more punishment than a Wizard but they have a built in 'concussion' effect (from level 1 with some races) to protect themselves.<br>
<br>
Verant can fix this, of course.  They need to ensure Wizards have the fast damage edge in a group while Rogues have the consistent and long term damage edge.  This isn't that hard to do, but they have to look at things they really don't want to at this point.<br>
<br>
And I agree that Wizards should focus on AE as much as they can, we have more AE than straight DD blasts.  There is a problem here too though... we have huge unpleasent gaps in our AE and it just isn't easy to get groups to do this Beryl, as you should well know.  Sayin &quot;just AE&quot; is nice and easy but its not enough.  And certainly you shouldn't mock nor impugn people who try to get other things done, should you? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uberylshadowhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beryl Shadowhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/27/01 3:27:51 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.unlv.edu/faculty/engstrom/images/bcard.jpg WIDTH=149 HEIGHT=175></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Came out kinda long...lol</span><hr size=1> Not at all, Grim, like I said up above, I hope you get a good grouping change for wizards.

I know how well played wizards can really make a difference and how much fun they can be to play. Maybe not everyone was made to play one.  Hard to say.  <br>
<br>
Yeah, Natan, that's a old observation I made a long time ago about the reasons behind some of VI's class balancing.  Let me flesh it out even more for ya.  If you get rid of all the solo classes, overall levelling speed drops off.  If you get rid of all the porting classes, overall levelling speed drops.  Keep classes from grouping they'll level slower.  If you keep players from levelling fast, they'll play and pay longer.  As bad as it might sound to players, it makes the bean counters at VI/SOE happy and they make all this possible.  So, yeah, I think that does play into some of the changes.  <br>
<br>
Now, on to your wizzy &amp; rogue living in harmony stuff...that's not the point I'm making here.  Let me try it a differnet way since you keep thinking I'm saying wizards v. rogues, and I'm not.  If VI decides to make wizards group friendly by giving them healing/buff spells like a cleric or crowd control/buff spells like a chanter, wizards would displace one of those two classes.  No matter what class I displace, they can't find a group, since there are a finite number of groups.  So they will have to find something to do without a group.  Now the question is, what can these folks do without a group? <br>

While I don't adhere to this, your theory would mean at that time we ruined the party for some other class by being more group friendly and working great.  I don't see that, I didn't see that, and I don't think its true.  Wizards were displaced in groups in the last year or so by people realizing that they didn't A) do what people thought they did and B) add as much to a group as other classes.<br>
<br>
There are already classes hurting bad for groups and play solo post 50 and I think THEY need work too.  Such as Paladins, they are pretty cool til the high 40s then they don't really fill any niche.  Magicians are terrific til the 50s then it starts to fall apart because Verant got cute with their pets and actually WEAKENED them according to most reports.  Necro pets got grotesquely more powerful (have you SEEN a rogue pet at work??) but Magicians got summon cake and a gating pet that cancels snare on the monsters.<br>
<br>
Basically what I am saying is this: fixing Wizards is my particular wish, but that doesn't mean other classes don't need work.  The fact we can solo doesn't mean we shouldn't be fixed, becuase I don't believe we'd displace anyone in groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/useifshadowfist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seif Shadowfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/5/01 7:04:39 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Some thoughts on grouping...</span><hr size=1> Both sides are well argued and I'm glad I read them all.<br>
