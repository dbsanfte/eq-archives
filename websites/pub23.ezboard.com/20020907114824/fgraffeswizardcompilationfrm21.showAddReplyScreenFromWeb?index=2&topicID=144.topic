<br>
1. The most important thing for a wizard is to *ALWAYS* stay close to the chanter.  By AE'ing you are generating a lot of aggro and if you are in between the chanter and the mobs you will also get proximity aggro.  Even if you are within range of the chanters stuns it is possible for mobs to be on the far side of you out of range of those stuns.  They will go to town!  So stay as close as possible.  Jyll's spells actually have a good range on them so you don't have to be in the middle of the pack provided they're &quot;stacked&quot; well.<br>
<br>
2. YOU have the best tool for bringing a scattered crowd into a tight &quot;stack&quot; to make everyone's jobs easier.  The Jyll's line of spells have a built-in knockback effect that over the course of a few AE's can move mobs a good distance.  It is important to realize that they are pushed not backwards from the direction they are facing, but simply in the direction YOU are facing.  So pick a corner to pull to, jam the chanter in the corner, and face the corner when AE'ing.  F9 out if you want to look around.  This will allow you to pull mobs into the corner instead of pushing them out from it.  This packs them tighter instead of spreading them out.  It also brings them closer to you and the chanter instead of pushing them away so you don't have to chase them around or worry about mobs going out of range of stuns or AE's.  If you do not have a corner or at least a wall to push mobs against, you can balance pushes against other AE'ers and the chanter to avoid lengthy migrations.  (Chanter stuns also push, but not nearly as much as Jyll's)  <br>
<br>
3. Corners are your chanter's best friend.  If your chanter(s) can get their buttocks wedged firmly into a corner they become much more resistant to interrupts since they won't have to worry about correcting for mobs that are pushing them.  This means you can pull larger trains with a single chanter.  <br>
<br>
4. Get between the mobs and your chanter if you only have one.  This lets you take some of the proximity aggro off the chanter and effectively tank for him/her. Yes, the chanter probably has a crapload more AC and HP than you because most members of their profession concentrate on that more than mana items.  However, YOU will take much less damage tanking for a chanter that is getting constant stuns off then you will take when your chanter is getting interrupted by mobs that could be hitting you instead.  This isn't a big deal when you have 2 enchanters however.<br>
<br>
5. On group composition:<br>
Druids have okay AE's.  They're a lot slower than mages or wizards, but will do in a pinch.  Clerics actually have a okay line of AE's too that are NOT limited to undead mobs.  For example the level 59 AE does over 600 damage with just a 1 second casting time.  The recast is atrocious however.  I AE'd for many levels without ever grouping with a wizard as an enchanter so don't assume you can't get by with other classes.  The number one underestimated AE class is bards however.  They have PB AE DoT's that can actually wrack up a ton of damage if a battle lasts a while.<br>
<br>
Warriors etc. make decent pullers, but by far the best pullers are the ones with some form of invulnerability spell.  Cleric's can do this at any level and are ideal for longer pulls since they have multiple invulnerability spells they can use to do longer pulls.  Necros can also do this, but must be really agile to survive once invulnerability wears off.  Paladins get one 20 second invulnerability spell at 55 and can do the job.  Bards get a group invulnerability song at 60 which is invaluable.  An invulnerable puller can absorb HT's and make huge trains in one pull.  <br>
<br>
A lot of unlikely group combo's can AE, so don't be afraid to try things out.<br>

<br>
1. Don't start nuking untill all mobs are under enchanters stun control. Give some time for enc to chain stun and get every inc mob under control before nuking. Esepically if there're caster mobs in the pull since they will take a longer time than melee mobs to arrive. Early nukage might cause you to be oom before all pulled mobs are dead.<br>
<br>
2. Tell the healer to concentrate more on the enc in group. Yes, even though we do all the damage, the enc will still out taunt us. And beleive it or not, if enc goes down, then everything will be lost.<br>
<br>
3. If you plan to pull more 8+ mobs, then better take 2 enc instead of 1, 3 resists in a 15+ pull is enough to stun the enc and break his chain stun. And again, when enc is down with 15+ mobs, we won't even have time to cast evac.<br>
<br>
4. Bard is good not only for their AE dot but also their AE slow. This will make it easier for the pure casters when some mobs resisted stun and starts pounding on them. Also their AE slow song has snare effect, this makes them good puller in most dungeons. However, they definately need to do multiple step pulls becuase of their lower than warrior hp and no invulunary spells.<br>
<br>
5. Besides corners, tight corridors are also good for gathering and packing mobs. Just have the wiz stand at both end of the mobs after they're under chain stun and pack them to the middle with our PBAE spells.<br>
<br>
6. Be prepare to die as accidents will happen.<br>
<br>
P.S. Best experience with PBAE group that I have consists of 2 wiz, 2 enc, 1 clr, and 1 bard. Clr for their group heal, hp buffs, and res. Bard for their pulling, mana song, and AE slow. 2 enc are better than 1 to keep everything under stun cntrol, and backup even if one dies. 2 wizard of course are for grinding through mobs for exp, loots, and glory <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukoveadlarhune.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kovea DLarhune</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/3/01 6:49:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AE Groups for Sorcerers</span><hr size=1> nothing in the game gives me quite the thrill of pb ae groups. for the classes that can participate its an entirely new dimesion to their class. i know a few cleric that were very skeptical about the whole idea and by the end of the night were pulling the biggest trains they could find and unleashing the 'useless' spell upheaval <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
the enchanter must have 3 stuns up ~ keeping the mobs controlled through stuns is what the ae group is built around. the level 52, 44 and i think level 20 color line of stuns seem to be the most effective. most of the ae groups that struggle seem to miss this point as the enchanter doesnt realize they need a third. from my experience (and it also depends on the level of the enchanter) one enchanter can control about 16 non summoning mobs. with the addition of a second enchanter it makes about 8 more manageable or higher level mobs. to emphasize <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> ENCHANTERS MUST HAVE 3 STUNS UP</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> or you are just going to be doing cr.<br>
<br>
pulling ~ da is very nice to have for the puller and in my favorite place for ae , howling stones, being able to absord all the ht is very important. i suppose just about any class could pull but unless its just a few mobs at a time to stack up using ae mez it isnt as effective. paladins (56?) bards (60) and clerics all are perfect for pulling. having the healer pull isnt much of a risk once they are back in camp with the enchanter permastunning the pull. if you are going to use a tank in the group make sure they get on the highest level/most dangerous mob in the pull.<br>
<br>
soloing/farming ~ with the epic rune or manaskin its a very effective way to clear greenies. even without the stun only 4 can attack at once so if you can find a spawn of 3 or 4 aggro a bunch of others and drag them into the middle of the set spawn. there will be a lot of interrupts but should be able 8 to 10 at once pretty easily if they have around 1600 hp. with the same type mob aggro shouldnt have any problem with runners as thy will stay after you unless only one is stll standing. for those of you working on faction for chardok in droga its a great way to solo but be careful with the number of mobs that ht you pull <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
one of the nice things at the time i was doing a lot of ae groups is that they are perfect for the underutized areas of high level zones. howling stones is great. and if you dont have a rogue but have a higher level exp group head to the east wing ~ gflux up onto the roof over the zone in and then levitate across. the karnors sewers are perfect for ae and with the changes to chardok i bet could do some impressive things in there. and if you really want people raving about wizards a single enchanter and wizard in a regular grind group in necropolis can easily handle the beetle traps for a nice boost on the exp bar. have fun! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umadleon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Madleon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/8/01 6:06:42 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://tyr.marietta.edu/~clanht/ho/fig/taxi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: AE Groups for Sorcerers</span><hr size=1> great advice guys, keep them coming. Can never share enough tips when it comes to PBAE groups as one person on the wrong page can muck up the whole run at it. <br>
<br>
As for the new zones in SoL, I have spotted some prime real estate for PBAE groups. Haven't tested it yet but definately test out Fungal Grove and The Grey, both zones have blues to 60s with low HP mobs and plenty of mobs to train. Especially the Grey, one puller sowed could easily pull 60-80 mobs with one trip around the desert.   <p><center><font face="System" size="-1"><a href="http://www.packetlost.com" target="_blank" name="Ho'Style"><img src="http://www.packetlost.com/ho/eq/luclin.jpg" border="0" alt="Mad's Toons"></a><br>

<br>
A mage will not do as the 2nd caster, their spell does not recycle as fast as a wizards for AE.  They will make an excellent 3rd caster and have a score of other functions to really help out like CoH, mod rods for epic wizards, damage shields and pets.<br>
<br>
Cleric/Paladin pull.  DA/DB rule for pulling and highly recommended way of getting the mobs to camp.  Once in camp it will be hard to lose agro.<br>
<br>
Epic Wizards or Runed wizards are VITAL.  If you dont have an epic, bring lots of dots.  While the rune is up, it is considerably easier to channel through.  I have tested this extensively and unless the mob has a nasty bash you will most likely channel through.  Think of it as you are the main tank, call out AE time, control the party.<br>
<br>
If the enchanter dies you die.  Runed and fully buffed.  Aego if possible.  Do not damage shield the enchanter!!<br>
<br>
Discuss the route the puller will take.  Best way is to run to a pre determined pull spot.  Only AE on 10 or more or it is just not efficient for mana reasons.  Mez, get more and remez until you get the tight group.<br>
<br>
SOW/Jboot the puller.  Another good reason to have a mage, he can CoH the puller in after he zones and jboots/SOWs up.<br>
<br>
Advanced Techniques:<br>
<br>
Everyone in the party turn off all graphics, /showspelleffects off.  One nice Winds of Geild and you can lag yourself to death.<br>
<br>
CE the puller prior to grabbing mobs.  When the mobs come to the group, CE/Torpor/Heal over time the enchanter.<br>
<br>
If you are real confident of the pathing, send in a pet or fear a mob into a crowd.  Tricky as the worst possible thing you can do is have a staggered train.<br>
<br>
For a single mob, paladin stun &gt; enchanter stun due to the damage.  If you accidently pull a boss mob, have the paladin go to town on the boss and solo tank/ chain stun until the fray is done.  Paladins also have wave of healing as an added bonus.<br>
<br>
Decession is wonderful with a CoH mage.  Allows the puller to be anyone.  You send the puller to zone, get Sowed (spend the money on the potion) and CoH the puller back.  You dont have to depend on a druid.<br>
<br>
60 wizards and a semi staggered pull, start off with winds of geild.  The reason is HUGE damage as a taunt.  Takes a little practice in timing but 1200hps of damage single shot will keep the mobs off the enchanter everytime and the range is huge for this spell.  It is a mana hog and has no use after the inital pull due to cast time.  If you mez park all mobs open up with this spell.  It will bring the mobs closer to you and away from the enchanter.<br>
<br>
56+ wizards are key to a good group.  Supernova is not practical and if you have a 55 or under wizard just wait for the refresh static pulse.  59+ if you are AEing velk's lab as the cold AE is more resisted.<br>
<br>
<br>
Luclin AE spots so far:<br>
<br>
The Grey<br>
<br>
Fungus Grove if high enough level.<br>
<br>
I will be attempting with a group of 60's and three sorcerers to AE maidens.  Umbrous Toilers seem like good targets to AE and easy to pull trains.  Substitue paladin/cleric puller for bard.  Not sure how it will work and will post results.<br>
<br>
Good luck.  Once you start AEing you will continue to find groups for nice experience and nice loot.  There is nothing like watching 20 yellow messages flying across worth of exp.<br>
