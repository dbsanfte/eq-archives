I actually like comparing mana and health (though the analogy is flawed), but for both to have the same effect on downtime, ALL healing spells would have to be removed, to be replaced by regen spells only.<br>

What good does it do that some classes can not contribute to fights or groups? Would the game somehow get more interesting and richer when everyone played a tank? What good is a fragile damage dealer class that does mush less damage than a tanking class?<br>

If you are worried that you are no longer a God in the game who gets all the fun and loot you should not be worried of less fortunate classes but the fact that everyone and his dog will be playing YOUR class eventually. <p><hr noshade size=1><font size=1><b><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14465">Ragbert</a>    / <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14471">Camembert</a>,

I feel that usually tanks in your usual exp spots..seb, HS, velks, do not need a healer.<br>
<br>
When was the last time you seen a tank in these areas lose more the one or two at the most, bulbs of life during a fight?<br>
<br>
Lol, how often do you see tanks 'soloing' in velks and seb? very often..<br>
<br>
Sorry, I'll have to agree with dryfft on this one. <br>
<br>
Of course, seb used to be a low/mid 50's zone but with AAxp its turned into a 59-60 zone.  low/mid 50's would need a healer there probably..<br>

Yes, you have demonstrated your inability to grasp this simple concept. <br>
<br>
Imagine there is a group of 3 warriors, 1 cleric, 1 rogue, 1 wizard.  (simple group for a simple example)<br>
<br>
1 warrior stands in front of the mob.  This warrior takes damage.  This warrior has a function of taking damage.  This warrior is in need of healing powers to maintain this function. This warrior also deals damage.  <br>
<br>
His ability to sustain damage dealing is, of course, dependent on his ability to stay alive.  Just as much as a wizard's ability to sustain damage is dependent on his ability to stay alive.<br>
<br>
This is why rogues are not selected to be the class that fulfils this function.<br>
This is why wizards are not selected to be the class that fulfils this function.<br>
This is why Warriors are normally selected to fulfil this function.<br>
<br>
The other 2 warriors, wizard, and rogue are all standing behind the mob.  They are NOT taking damage.  They are all dealing damage.  They do not need healing powers in order to deal this damage.<br>
<br>
They do not need healing powers in order to deal damage any more than a wizard needs healing powers to deal damage.<br>
<br>
However, a wizard in this situation will not be able to sustain damage output when mana is gone.<br>
Yet, the above 2 warriors, and rogue would be able to.<br>

Three, really:<br>
<br>
1)  Soloing;<br>
2)  Raiding;<br>
3)  Pick-up Grouping.<br>
<br>
     Casters need balancing in the third.  The reason, as others have stated, is that they are unable to sustain damage over time in a moderately equipted group with a moderate pull rate.  IOW:  the most common &quot;ock-up&quot; group in EQ.  These are the groups that most EQ players will exp in.  <br>
<br>
     The &quot;Heal&quot; argument.  Remember, we are always taliking about the ability of a GROUP to sustain damage over time.  So rather than state that &quot;a warrior needs heals to do damage&quot; or a &quot;wizard needs heals to do damage,&quot; the correct statement is &quot;A GROUP NEEDS HEALS TO DO DAMAGE&quot; over a sustained period of time.  <br>
<br>
     Which brings us to the real question for a pick-up group - which combination of classes will allow the longest and fastest sustained damage over time - IOW the least down time.  The answer is that the most mana effecient combo is the Warrior/Cleric.  This is far more effecient, from a sustained damage perspective, then Warrior/Wizard.  <br>
<br>
     The next question, what 6 classes will allow the greatest sustained damage over time in a moderately equipted moderate rate pull group?  I submit to you, that you build around the &quot;Heal&quot; mana effecient Warrior/Cleric Nucleus.  You add a Chanter for mana regen and Crowd control.  After all, the mana regen will help the Cleric heal over a longer sustained period of time.  So now we have our core three classes, now what?  Number 4 should be a SOWer/Snarer/back-up healer/Debuffer.  Number five and six should can be interchangeable, but should be melee &quot;Damage dealers&quot; for optimum effeciency.  Monks, Rogues and Rangers work nicely here.<br>

<br>
This exact same thing could be said of wizards.  When the tank doesnt get heals, the wizard gains aggro and dies.  Therefore caster cobat depends on receiving heals.  Remeber we are talking about *group* situations.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the easy way to look at this is to seperate out &quot;tanking&quot; and &quot;damage dealing.&quot;  Tanking is a utility along the lines of snare/mez/root etc.  These are used to prevent the party from taking damage (or in this case doing all the damage to a single target that can take it best). This requires heals.  <br>
<br>
Melee damage does not require any heals to do by itself, just like caster damage.  However caster damage is limited by the mana bar, melee damage is not.<br>

<br>
Whereas I think that Dryfft simply enjoys getting a rise out of people (:P) he makes a valid point.  The tank that isn't taking damage doesn't ever need to stop swinging.  Once the caster is OOM though, it's sit city for them (unless they wanna melee).<br>
<br>
The best way that this would have been resolved from the beginning is to have melee's much more dependant on something that isn't easily healed.   The stamina bar issue has been mentioned in this thread, and I believe that would have been a great way to go in the beginning.<br>
<br>
Of course, it's too late to change any of this now.  But something that Verant could change is the rate at which our mana is replenished.  Thereby keeping us in the fight.  I suggested a mana healer type class in another thread, and people said that would make the game unbalanced.  But I say that would finally make the casters once again balanced.  Only by having our own limiting attachment to the mana bar lowered can we hope to get back into the grouping game.<br>

<br>
I do not need a healer for myself EVER.  The warrior, monk, and rouge all need to be near the mob to do damage, so at least one of them will get hit.  They don't all need to be healed, but they are all dependant on the tank who does need to be healed.<br>
<br>
I certainly think that some balancing needs to be done here, but like I said before; If we could put out the same dmg/sec as a melee, then why would anyone ever play a melee??<br>
<br>
I would get in a group with six wizards.  We could keep the mob rooted and blast it to hell.  Plus, when I was done fighting I can gate home, or bind myself, or whatever.<br>
<br>
You HAVE to consider all of the advantages of a caster when you do the balancing.  Clearly damage is the most important, but being able to do damage from a distance, being able to do damage very fast, being able to port, etc.  All of these things have to be taken into account.  Maybe a solution would be to increase our dmg/sec, but remove our root spell (this is NOT what I want, but it might then be reasonable for us to match a melee in dmg/sec). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarmok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Need a log parsed?</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/02 8:30:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=53>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do casters need balancing?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I do not need a healer for myself EVER.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
While this isn't the most preposterous claim I've read on this board, it comes close. I suppose you do not need a resurrection, EVER, as well? You've obviously not fought anything that can summon... well, at least hard enough to carry your weight. Keep your claims in the realm of plausibility and the rest of your commentary will be taken more seriously.<br>

Others have addressed the fallacy of this argument earlier in this thread, but I'll try again.  Lets take the group above (warrior, monk, and rogue), and a hypothetical fight with a single mob lasting 60 seconds. Over the course of that fight the mob in question does 900 points of damage, spread evenly between the 3 melee characters. Now, replace the monk with a wizard. Assuming the wizard does the same damage as the monk did, the fight will still last 60 seconds, and the mob will still do 900 points of damage to the party. Assuming the wizard avoids gaining agro, the damage will be split between the warrior and the rogue at 450 damage each. At the end of the battle, the same amount of healing needs to be done. Adding a wizard to the party does not result in a party with a lower healing load. Sorry.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If we could put out the same dmg/sec as a melee, then why would anyone ever play a melee??<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You could make a convincing argument if you replaced &quot;melee&quot; with &quot;rogue&quot; as rogues have little other utility, but Warriors, Monks, Shadowknights, Paladins, Rangers, and Bards all have other skills they bring to the table (utility) that is just as important (if not more so) than &quot;root.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uactinicpercussive.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Actinic Percussive</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/02 9:06:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/rommel/actsig.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do casters need balancing?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Now, replace the monk with a wizard.

While this isn't the most preposterous claim I've read on this board, it comes close. I suppose you do not need a resurrection, EVER, as well? You've obviously not fought anything that can summon... well, at least hard enough to carry your weight. Keep your claims in the realm of plausibility and the rest of your commentary will be taken more seriously.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
No, I have not ever fought anything that can summon, so I am speaking based on my level of experience.  Perhaps &quot;ever&quot; was to strong of a word.  I should have said &quot;as long as things are going as planned.&quot;  I will sometimes need to be healed, just as sometimes a full group will be wiped out.  My point was that I don't have to plan on having a healer.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
At the end of the battle, the same amount of healing needs to be done. Adding a wizard to the party does not result in a party with a lower healing load.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I never said it did.  You are assuming too much from my statement.<br>
<br>
You seem to think that I am disagreeing that casters need balance.  I am not.  I am saying that our balance can not be based solely on a dmg/sec comparison with a warrior (or monk, or any melee).<br>
<br>
Would it be fair for warriors if they put out equal sustained damage as a wizard yet they were not able to..<br>
-increase their damage rate as they see fit<br>
-gate back to their bind spot after dyeing<br>
-solo<br>
-evac the group<br>
<br>
I realize that the main focus of balancing is based on what each class brings to a group situation.  But these other abilities do matter.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I do think wizards, and all casters, need balancing.  I agree that a big part of that involves increasing our dmg/sec.  I just find it hard to believe that you cannot see any of the advantages of being a wizard. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uoxoxoxoxox.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Oxoxo Xoxox</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalRainbow.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/02 11:04:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www2.swmed.edu/libraryis/eq/wizsig4.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Why do casters need balancing?</span><hr size=1> Its too complicated for you Dryfft, lets try again.<br>
<br>
Someone has to tank in an XP group and a raid.  If it is an XP group and the tank doesnt get a heal he dies and then everyone else dies.  Tanks cant do damage because they are dead.  Thats pretty easy to understand so give that a little whirl on your little mouse wheel.<br>
<br>
On a raid you have rampage, enrage, missmanaged aggro, main tank switch for defensive, and cast AEs.  If your secondary melee dont get heals they die and you lose your DPS and cant kill the mob if healers dont go first.  Then you have dead melee that are not doing damage as a direct result of not getting healed.  I know its difficult, but try to breathe and go slow, it will come to you eventually <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarchilkracker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Archil Kracker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/11/02 12:10:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ....</span><hr size=1> I dunno about you people, but I don't have a very stable connection, so when I quad..( and god do I hate doing it...)

<br>
Sure, we get snares, aes, and insta damage spells<br>
<br>
But I'd like to do as much damage as a warrior/rogue can and not have the SAME liability as them. HPs.<br>
<br>
So... yeah, wizards need heals just as much as warriors do, just not the same spells (ie.. CH)<br>
<br>
I know im not uberly experienced with a wizard, which is why i look to this board for advice...<br>
<br>
But I still remember starting my wizard when bonds of force wasn't a snare....were we uber godly solo'ers back then? ...not really, I saw an actual need for wizards pre-kunark. after kunark, we just got left in the dust =p<br>

The problem is that melee's have been &quot;mudflated&quot; for three years, while casters have been given practically no upgrades. I find myself using mostly the same spells that were available when Kunark was released, while melee's would laugh at Kunark weapons.<br>
<br>
In early EQ, wizards were invited to groups because they were among the best damage dealers in the game. I remember EQ in 1999 when I was playing my shadowknight. Getting a wizard in the group was like the highest luck you could get in orc groups in highpass hold, since fights would go so much faster (and not to mention, KSers could usually be outgunned). <br>
<br>
So yes, casters need some serious balancing. Not just pathetic changes like decreasing the amount of bonechips necro pets use when summoned (last patch change), but real changes that increase casters' damage output considerably.<br>

When did all meleers become tanks?<br>
<br>
Monks and rogues aren't considered tanks yet they do the most damage.  Monks can actually tank OK if need be.<br>
<br>
Wizards, magician and necros primarily fill the same role as monks and rogues.  Of the three, wizards do by far the least damage outside of level 60 on certain raids.  Anybody who brings &quot;utility&quot; spells into the arguement can show me how much mana a grouped wizard spends on utility spells vs. damage spells.  The ratio is not even close.<br>
<br>
As for soloing, monks who are currently giving rogues a run for their money in high level damage, are able to bind wound up to 70% at 51.  Plus add 3 points per tick to hp regen with Natural Regeneration.  Don't forget Mend.  I don't know if First Aid stacks with their natural bandaging bonus but if it does they could bind up to 100%.<br>
<br>
I think what's happened to alot of longtime players of Everquest is like the old story about how to cook frogs.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You know, you don't put them in when the water's boiling hot or they'll freak and jump out of the pot.  Put them in when the water's still cool and by the time they notice they're getting cooked it's too late to jump out.<br>
<br>
At some point between EQ 1.0 and Kunark, Verant quietly decided that since casters have so much utility(LOL compare a bard's abilities to a wizard's utility sometime) that meleers should do more damage.  By -gradually- phasing out damage casters as damage dealers, Verant was able to lessen the outrage than if they had made the change overnight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=710.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=710.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=710.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=710.topic&start=81&stop=84>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=710.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=710.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=710.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=710.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=710.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=710.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=710.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
