You know what? This game is all about efficiency. It is plain and simple, it is a melee based game. Anyone who supports the meleers, i.e. Clerics, who are very efficient at assisting meleers are in demand. Enchanters, who augment meleers and dictate a fight, are in demand. Druids and Shaman also round out meleers are in demand. Necros can augment healers and cast pets (more meatshields), along with mages, therefore useful to meleers. Plus Mages have potentially one of the most useful spells in the game with CoTH, again, useful to meleers (and DS's).<br>
<br>
Wizards have a few things to offer meleers, like our stuns and dd's (and a stacking DS, LMAO). In places, like Velious, not only do the mobs have more hps, they also have high MR, so our stuns become less efficient. PLUS, where the hell is our 57 or 58 atun, the impossible one to find? Also, with the resistances our non-magic based spells are also hitting for less, so what do we do? We get lures, which are BULLSHIT IMHO. Lures do nothing less than make us less efficient as casters. We are supposed to be the efficient nukers, to augment meleers because we can't buff or heal or sow or clarity. They take longer to cast, do less damage and are less efficient in damage. We also have Bane spells, what a crock of crap. We not only have to quest for them, we have to be level 60 to use. What kind of BS is that? That makes all 1% of Wizards more useful in VERY limited situations, plus do you think a group wants to shell out cash for our regents to cast it?<br>
<br>
Without efficiency, we are not extremely useful, therefore folks want us when we are efficient, and that's when combat is about to begin or it's over to take meleers where they need to go next to kill. Thanks for the new TL's, VI. This way I can make cash for my alternate, that assists meleers more efficiently.<br>
<br>
<br>
I wish I had the patience to write more, and all folks could even pay attention that long, cuz this would be one HELL OF A post.<br>

Hate to break it to you, but in Velious Mage and Necro pets = little more than armed, wet pieces of paper. When things hit for 400+ and Rampage/Flurry a pet goes down faster than a.....well, nevermind. The game is about efficiency, yes, but it is also about fun. Ask any Mage or Enchanter or Shaman is they actually ENJOY themselves on these big raids. I'm pretty sure the answer will be no. Enchanters and Shamans have been reduced to buff dispensers, most of their class defining abilites are useless in the big fights. Enchanters will C2, Gift of Brilliance casters and Rune/Speed tanks, then they're pretty much done. They may get to throw in a Tash or 2 if they're lucky, but other than that they're just 1 more person. Shamans have their HP/Stat/AC buffs they pass around (Ever seen a shaman break down because of his buffing duties and how mundane/maddening they are? Not a pretty thing), then after that they Malo/Malasini. If they're even more lucky they get to recast slow about 40 times until it sticks, sometimes dying repeatedly in the process. And Mages, well a Mage's job starts and ends at CoH. They may cast a few token pets during the fight, but other than that they're glorified intra-zone teleportation (and you people whine about US being taxies).<br>

<br>
The Markar's Discord spell has had it's drop rate increased DRAMATICALLY, you can easily find this off of the Sebilite Juggernauts in the area surorunding Trakanon's Lair. It's a pretty nifty spell, long stun and decent ratio.<br>
<br>
AS for your assumption that Lures are, quote: &quot;BULLSHIT IMO,&quot; you must have very little idea what a godsend these spells have been for us. Would it be nice to have our regular nukes hit the Velious uber-MOBs? (Which in some cases they do, although these instances are limited) IT would be nice, but it won't happen. Lures allow us to hit pretty much ANYTHING in the game. The ratio isn't great, but it's not crap either. It's about the same as some of our pre-50 dd's, and can still allow you to get 10-12 of them off on a full bar of mana with C2 (From the lovely buffing Enchanters). The Bane spells are not the best spells int he game, but they are definitely very nice. The best mana/damage ratio of all our nukes with no resist check, they allow us to do LARGE amounts of damage in a short amount of time. The peridot cost is negligible at the level and game stage you get these spells, most if not all guilds will pay the price for the peridots. These spells are great for the fights they were designed for, mainly the HUGE HP Velious fights. Kland/Zland hardly count, with our regular Lures we can do significant damage to these 2 dragons. The Bane spells are designed for the upper tier fights in Temple of Veeshan and vs the large Giants like Velkator. The main probelm I see with the Bane spells is the faction system. It should be entirely possible for a Wizard to get both of these spells without massive faction work. As a Kael-alligned Wizard I have my Dragon's Bane, but I should still be able to get the Giant's bane to be used on the non-Kael giants.<br>

You must be referring to Lower Guk or Sebilis, because in most places of Velious Mage pets are about as useful as a level 40 Ranger =)<br>
