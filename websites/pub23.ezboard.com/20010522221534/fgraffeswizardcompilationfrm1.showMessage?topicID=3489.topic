I personaly find dueling a great deal of fun, and like to find ways to exploit the weakness of other classes to my advantage.<br>
<br>
Warriors and Rogues: <br>
<br>
Stait out melees, I find these two the easiest to defeat. With no special powers, we can shadow step right around them. Typical spells I use are as follows:<br>
<br>
Invis<br>
Shadow Step<br>
Bonds<br>
AE Rain Series<br>
Primary DD<br>
Tishans<br>
Root Series<br>
Skin series<br>
<br>
Rangers, SKs, and Pallys:<br>
Hybrids are typicly a little harder, but are still easy to confuse with shadow step because they rely on melee for the majority of damage. Pallys require you to make them you LoH, med to full, and start again. For the most part we can outlast them in the long run as our mana regen is faster then their HP regen, and their spells require lots more mana then ours do. The invis trick wouldn't work well with rangers because of their tracking, but then rangers die fairly easily.<br>
<br>
Shadow Step<br>
Cancel Magic series<br>
Primary DD<br>
Skin series<br>
Bonds of Force<br>
Rain Series<br>
Invis<br>
<br>
Casters:<br>
Clerics, Druids, Shamans<br>
I've never dueled on of these guys yet, I'd imagine clerics with CH would be almost impossible to defeat unless we could get the final nuke in before the CH goes off. Druids and Shamans do the Sow thing, but I bet our level 16 bolt spell could force them to come coser or die at a distance. Invis Wouldn't work with druids after 20 because of tracking.<br>
<br>
Mages, Necros, Enchanters:<br>
I've never Dueled these guys yet either, I would be interested to hear what works best on these guys.<br>
<br>
Wizards:<br>
In a wizard duel it's all about the resists, and interupts. If your resists are higher then his you are at the advantage, otherwise Magic based DD with a knockback can turn the tables. If you can get a Tishan's to stick, you'll have enough time to hit them with Nullify Magic, this can cause dramatic turns if you knock out resist spells or skin spells. I personaly, if I have enough of an advantage, like to finnish with Gravity Flux (esp since I just got it, awsome spell to finnish with style).<br>
<br>
Skin spell<br>
Main DD<br>
Elemental Armor<br>
Tishan<br>
Shock of Lightning<br>
Nullify Magic<br>
Gravity Flux<br>
Rain Spell<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, has anyone noticed that Gravity Flux and Rain spells have very low resist rates in PvP combat? <br>

Them trying to nuke you down will probably be just as ineffective as you doing it. Just harrass/med. Whittle them down and be patient.<br>

I used to play a level 52 wizard on a PvP server (Vallon Zek).<br>
<br>
The biggest advantage your class has over other caster classes is you get unresistable DD. The only class that comes close is Necro with their unresistable lifetaps. So use this fact to your advantage, and get some resist gear. With platinum/blue diamond jewelry and some other good choices, you can get well over 100+ in all resists. Before you think further about what tactics you're going to use against other classes, first try to understand the full implications of what 100+ in every resist means.<br>
<br>
First of all, because you have 100+ SV MAGIC, you will resist any root/stun/snare/darkness-type spell practically EVERY time. In other words, you're completely free to exercise your maximum mobility. The only spell that can still alter your movement is the near-unresistable level 59 enchanter spell Rapture. (Gravity flux, by the way, is extremely resistable in PvP.) You will also heavily resist any other status effects. This includes everything except certain spells which debuff resists like Tashan and Malo and are unresistable. (Even so, the 45 point deduction of Malo is nothing against a wizard with fully maxed saves.)<br>
<br>
Second, with 100+ SV FIRE and SV COLD, you will heavily resist everyone's DD but your own. Cleric, druid, shaman, necro, and magician nukes will all be doing 10 points of damage to you nearly every time, while enchanters won't land a single nuke. With manaskin and manasink on, this means practical immunity to all non-wizard nukes. (Bigger nukes like ice comet might still do a noticeable chunk of damage every once in a while.)<br>
<br>
Finally, with 100+ SV POISON and SV DISEASE, 90% of all dots become useless - you will resist them every time. Shamans, for instance, won't be able to dot you at all.<br>
<br>
So what spells are going to hit you? Here's a list of the only remaining damage spells that can pierce through your resist gear.<br>
<br>
Splurt<br>
Winged Death (and its predecessors)<br>
Pyrocuror (and its predecessors)<br>
Vexing Mordinia (and its predecessors)<br>
Lifetaps<br>
Lures<br>
<br>
Splurt is a level 51 necro dot which does 1600 damage over the course of a minute and a half, for 237 mana. Winged Death does a devastating 1287 damage very quickly for 350 mana. Pyrocuror is a long-lasting fire-based dot that does 1998 points of damage. Vexing Mordinia is a deadly lifetap dot whose offensive side hurts almost as much as Winged Death. Among the lifetaps, Deflux is the most dangerous, this one delivers and heals 330 points of damage in just 3 seconds, for about 200 mana. And then we have our own lures, which give us a fighting chance against classes who have these spells.<br>
<br>
So what do you notice when you look at this list? Everything except the lures and lifetaps are dots. Furthermore, ALL of them are easily dispelled using Nullify or Annul Magic. Before you hit /duel, leave an open buff slot at the top of your buff list, followed by several crap buffs to keep your important ones from being accidentally dispelled. When you see your opponent casting, say, Winged Death, start casting Nullify/Annul Magic on yourself BEFORE the dot hits. If you time it right, the dot will disappear right off you doing absolutely no damage whatsoever, as if it were a pitiful enchanter nuke that got resisted. It doesn't always work, and when it doesn't (especially in the case of this dot), you're going to get hurt before your dispel gem refreshes again. To solve this, simply mem BOTH dispels, Nullify and Annul magic, at the same time, so you can switch back and forth between them (i.e. instant recast). Now that the druid's dots are being dispelled and his nukes resisted like crazy, he's doing hardly any damage to you at all. You, on the other hand, have lure damage up your sleeves.<br>
<br>
Lifetaps are more difficult to deal with, especially Deflux, an unresistable lifetap universally dreaded by all non-necromancer casting classes. Given a stand-still cast-out fight, a modestly equipped necromancer chain-casting Deflux will out-tap EVERYBODY. Lifetaps like this one are what make necromancers so feared in duels, and on PvP servers. But lifetaps have one fatal flaw, and you can exploit it. They are useless against Manasink, a buff unique to us wizards. They damage you through your skin, but they don't heal the necro. Not for a single point of damage. In fact, if you stack Manaskin (or your epic effect, if you have it) with Manasink, the necro will have to cast Deflux at least 5-6 times before he can start healing himself. By that time, he's dead from three lures. Say he wanted to dispel those two skins off you, so he could tap you. Remember those crap buffs under the empty space? If you played it right, you'll have a lot of them. See invisible, heat/chill sight (they stack), enduring breath (fingerbone hoop), even o'keils flickering flame - the necro must dispel ALL these before he can heal himself. The process will be even slower if you keep clicking jboots after each dispel. By the time he's dispelled the skin off, he's dead, from 3 unresisted lures.<br>
<br>
Druids, clerics, and shamans are trickier. While they don't have any spells like yours that do unstoppable damage (i.e. they can't kill you), they have insanely efficent healing spells that will ruin your chances of killing THEM. There are two main ways you can get around this. Shock of Lightning, and psych-outs. Shock of Lightning, the level 12 wizard DD, will always knock your opponent back a full 2 feet unless it's fully resisted. Unless their channeling is good or they are using a fast spell, like Remedy or Chloroblast, they will get interrupted, and before they're finish attempting their failed spell, you can hit them with another lure. A cleric won't get a 10-second CH off. Some high-level PvPers learn around this and take a step forward after being hit by SoL. This increases their chance of channeling the spell. A possible way around this is to face *diagonally* away from them, so they'll be knocked back diagonally, making it harder for them to step forward. But I never tested this. The second main way to get around these classes is to use psych-outs. This means trick them into thinking they can kill you, refraining from breaking out with your lures until the end of the fight. This is hard to do if they see you're resisting their nukes and dispelling their dots and such, but do whatever it takes to get a druid or a shaman to waste all of his mana trying to kill you, and he might not have enough left to heal himself once you shift into offensive mode. One thing to realize is that lures are inefficient in PvP, they do only 403 damage compared to their normal 640, which is their one weakness that balances their deadliness.<br>
<br>
If the cleric or druid is prepared, you won't win. A cleric/druid might try to jump in and melee you, in which case (even though they both suck at melee) you would theoretically lose.<br>
<br>
Against pets, just root them. Smart mages and necros will dispel their pets, but there are ways around this. Use some right-clickable items like the Bracer of the Hidden or the Fingerbone Hoop to buff the pet up with crap buffs before you root it. The necro/mage will be dispelling those crap buffs, instead of root. The Staff of Temperate Flux is also useful for this, since it instantly inflicts a dispellable status ailment. Enchanters have a bigger dispel for their own pets, but with the flux staff, bonds of force, and more right-click items, the tactic works theoretically the same.<br>
<br>
Against melees, it's an entirely different game. If you play it right, you will win, but if you do one thing wrong, you lose miserably. Melees, especially at high levels, hit HARD. The key to winning against melee types at all levels is Shadow Step. Learn how to dance around in close quarters against a melee type to avoid getting hit. (Mouse-look together with strafe-left and strafe-right is good for this.) When their back is turned, quickly sneak a Shadow Step before they notice. (Have it hotkeyed next to your strafe-left, strafe-right keys so you can hit it quickly). If you step 2 feet away, keep dancing and try again. If you step far away, sneak in range and hit them with a lure. Another tactic is to use the terrain: stand behind a sand dune if you're in the desert, and hit them while they aren't looking. If you can't see them, they can't see you. (Indoors, hitting a melee type with a spell from a completely different room is called &quot;line of sight exploiting&quot; and is frowned upon by PvPers.) Another thing you can do to trick people (if you're using draughts), is to run diagonally over a hill, but then turn the other way and cast a draught. They'll stop confused to look where they are before they find you. That usually allows you the time to get off a free draught. If they're a warrior with HP gear, you might not finish them off, in which case you will need to shadow step and invis yourself. You med faster than they regen HP, unless they are wearing a regen tunic. If you're fighting a shadowknight with a pet, quickly dispense of the pet by casting a couple draughts, or if you get the jump on them, an ice comet.<br>
<br>

While their offence is weak, they can render you harmless with ease.  <br>
<br>
At lower levels they'll just mana sieve you, and it's a matter of resists and your mana pool that determines whether you manage to kill them before you run OOM.  Once you're OOM, they can keep you that way and just wear you down with a pet.<br>
<br>
At the highest levels (59+), they'll just rapture you and then sieve you dry.  Rapture is unresistable in duels.  An enchanter only has magic based nukes and it's very easy to get your MR up to the point where they can't touch you.  However, it is highly difficult to keep that chanter pet or (worse yet) a charmed mob off of you when you're OOM, unable to sit down to med, and being sieved occasionally so that you can't even count on standing regen to get you enough for a root.  (A good enchanter will have cast resist magic on their pet so you'd have to debuff it before having a good chance of rooting it anyways)  <br>
<br>
I haven't seen a strategy that works against an enchanter who knows to use Mana Sieve.  The ones that want to debuff (i.e. Cripple, weaken, etc) you, fear you, and otherwise do other resistable things will be cake unless your MR is too low.  <br>
<br>
If it's any consolation, while a competent enchanter will beat a wizard almost all the time, they have extreme problems with meelee classes such as warriors.  Without a suitably strong NPC at hand to charm, they're in a world of pain.<br>
