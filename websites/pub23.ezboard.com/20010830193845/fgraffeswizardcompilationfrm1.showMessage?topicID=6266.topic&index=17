(not a rant!)</span><hr size=1> I enjoy quests and think they can be fun, I dont enjoy taking redicoulous amounts of time to complete something.  So what if everyone gets item XXXX, if its valuable enuff that every one and there dog is going to be hunting it why put us under terms were we have to sit for 50+ hours to get the item?  It's lame.  If someone is the appropriate level they should be able to get an item without to much difficulty, yes some challenge but reward versus time and effort is a problem in this game.  Right now im stuck on the prayer shall quest becase its to difficult to compete with all the tracking druids stealing all the griffons in EW.  I can't find griffons to fight and they never drop eggs for me when I do find them.  <br>
<br>
I really wish they would change the amount of time it takes to do some quests.  I love this game and it is fun but at the rate things are going I may give it up just becase it takes too long to do anything.  Ya I may be a little impatient, but come on verant, reduse the time on things.  So what if your purposely trying to keep people in the game to make money by making it take forever to do anything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/useverinewolfe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Severine Wolfe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/15/01 4:44:30 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.clan-donald.com/screenshots/severine.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are Quests Fun?

I had fun doing Staff of The Wheel also... I had Skinn and he knew what he was doing, so that made it fun.<br>
<br>
I spent most of my 40s questing, which explains why I am ready to get my Pheno's but I haven't done it, and why I wont go on a Kedge Raid to finish my epic and why I never even started the Coldain Prayer Shawl quests.  I also quested armor for alts so at the moment I am sick to the eyeballs of quests.<br>

I think Sevvypoo will sit out questing for a good long while.  If I never speak to another NPC it will be too soon. <p><table border="3" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#000000" width="398" height="190">

Personally I find the quests boring. Hell I don't even read the text most of the time.<br>
<br>
I like the results though at times.<br>
<br>
What can I say, buffers full of inarticulate prose doesn't do it for me. /shrug<br>
<br>
One thing I've always wanted to know is what the original FA quest was that Brad wrote and no-one found that alledgedly worked. I'm going to ask him in ask Brad in fact - only just thought of it and it would be an awesome opportunity <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Cassius Runeblaze &lt;Avatars of Discord&gt;<BR>

And now I carry it once again for an instant recast item (it too does not need to be equipped to use) for those mobs that require it (Dozekar). Flux Staff? Still hotkeyed like most every wizard. It has been my friend for going on 2 years. Runescale cloak? Still carry it for DR/PR gear.<br>
<br>
7th Shawl. Most cherished possession because I made it myself and put in all my spare time on it. Quest. many parts were fun. Some were not.<br>
<br>
It is Everquest afterall. <br>
<br>
Staff of Wheel? A right of passage for all young wizards. Loved the quest. Died many times acquiring it many moons ago.  I wish they would make a quest involving you to turn this in to someone. It is past its prime for the most part.<br>
<br>
Tumpy Tonics. 2400 of them completely got me from beginning of level 48 to ding! 49 (It was actually faster than hunting I believe and I just couldn't WAIT for Ice Comet) That is where I also became a master brewer (135). Hey I like quests I said!<br>
<br>
Quests are what you make them. If you approach them like work, then they will seem like work. But somehow the reward, no matter how small, is always gratifying for a quest you did.<br>
<br>
And the BEST part of being a wizard is that we can do SO many of them solo (way before other classes can solo them) unlike other classes.<br>

(not a rant!)</span><hr size=1> I am in agreement with most posters here. I enjoy quests immensely, as long as I don't have to sit at a camp forever hoping for a ultra-rare spawn.  One reason I haven't done much for my epic is that 1) I don't have the patience to wait for phinny/vs to pop on their long rotations (I understand why, but it's still ridiculous) 2) I don't belong to an uber guild and will never be able to beat them to these spawns.  Everytime Phinny pops, one of the uber guilds is usually there w/in 5 minutes, and 30 minutes later, Phinny is toast.<br>
<br>
The quests I enjoyed the most were the Temple quests.  SoTF was a truly fun quest, that my friends were able to help me with, and was able to get it in a few hours. At lvl 52, I still have my acumen mask and runescale cloak on me.  Once I get something better, I will replace them, but I have yet to get or buy better.<br>
Staff of Wheel quest was truly great. I did 8/10's of it solo.  And had a cleric friend help me w/ the hand in L guk. we ran to the camp ITU, then he threw up Divine Aura, while i grabbed the rod and evac'ed us.  The other part I did w/ a friend, was the Lake Rathe (I hate that ONE gobbie that sees invis...grrrrrr).  I died several times doing the rathe and oasis one, just cause of those gobbies, but it was worth it.  I did that quest 3 times. 2 times for the runes, and once for the actual staff and identify crystal.  I kept that staff until about a week ago, when some friends got me the sorcerous bowl and book of obulous.  If you are pre-49ish, and turn in the staff and crystal for the runes, you get really, really good exp for them. Plus you have the runes to make Ice Comet!<br>
       Lately, I have found myself doing quests for my twinks (ranger, enchanter, mage), and having a blast doing those too.  My chanter now has most of the incandescent items, and my mage has 3/4 of the focus items.  Quests are a great break from the grind of leveling, and with a wiz, i can farm pretty much every zone in the old world with relative ease. Probably one of the biggest reasons I don't level as quick as others, is that I always need to keep the game fresh for me, so I do a whole bunch of different things just to have fun with the game.<br>
