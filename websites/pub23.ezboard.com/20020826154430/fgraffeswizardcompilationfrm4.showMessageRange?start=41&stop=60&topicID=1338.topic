There is a problem with your example.  To transfer enough mana to give the cleric a CH would require about 25 seconds.  So unless the Cleric warned you in advance he was having mana issues your ability to transfer mana would make no difference.<br>
<br>
Heck if the mob is slowed I could stack Theft, Shadowbond and Pact upon the tank for less mana and keep him alive just fine against standard XP mobs.  For less mana and still do damage to the mob.<br>

<br>
1st of all Mag's in no way is indicative of the necromancer community , we love a good debate and for the most part very dedicated to our class (can be whiny sometimes but what class can't).<br>
<br>
2nd There has been a lot of talk over the years about twitching being seen as derogatory , BUT most Necromancers will do it when needed . The most commonly accepted viewpoint was that Necromancers were a damage dealing class from day one and are one of the few if not only class that undergoes such a radical about face as the game progresses. Necromancers started out from level 1 as a damage dealing class and then in the post 50 game became more of a support class . Many Necro's over the years have adamantly and vehemently opposed that .<br>
<br>
3rd Part of the bitterness in the Necro community was when a high level Verant employee said that what had happened to Necromancers was &quot;Working as intended because Necro's had to pay for their power at some point in the game &quot; . That rubbed alot of people raw . <br>
<br>
4th The biggest bone of contention for necros is that there just isnt as much room in the end game for multiple Necro's. <br>
Have one wizard at a fight boom he blows stuff up , have 2 wizards at a fight and boom they blow up 2 times as much as the one . Add a 3rd wizard and Boom blow up 3 times as much , (I'm sure you see the progression here ) . Whereas with Necromancers, 1 necro , GUILD say OMG did you see how much Damage necro_001 did , add 2nd Necro , GUILD says wow did you see how much necro 1 did , and necro 2 was sort of cool . Add a 3rd Necro GUILD says wow did you see how much necro 1 did , 2 was sort of cool , why exactly was the 3rd necro here again (it gets worse the more necros you add , whereas it only gets better the more wizards you add ). <br>
<br>
Btw this is not meant to be a moan session was trying to bring a lil sense to a WAY OVER DRAMATIC presentation from one of my kindred Necro's<br>

The reason for this is that we ALL know that for most raids (99.9% of them anyway) Wizards are needed and I don't think that anyone will debate that. However I did NOT create my Wizard so that when I hit level 50+ she could be everyone's raid bitch. Yes, raids are fun (even if you loose exp and walk away with nothing) but they aren't going to get you to your next level. So lets get this rant back on track and talk about <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> grouping</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->!<br>
<br>
Ok, I won't get into how <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> feel the game should have been designed to begin with, but instead I will point out a number of key problems with our class. The first and most glaring problem has to do with perception. With the exception of my guild and my roommate, I don't think that anyone that I have played with really knows what it is that I bring to a group, and even then they don't usually group with Wizards unless its me. This is because in truth they know what it is that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> bring to the group. I'll explain.<br>
<br>
EVERY class that can cast a spell can nuke; and before you start saying that Wizard's nukes are faster, do more damage, or use less mana, I'm not done yet. As a Wizard when you join a group as far as anyone is concerned (even your guild and RL friends who know you real well) the only two things you bring to the group are nukes and teleports. So ask yourself If you are in a group with a warrior, and enchanter, a cleric, and a druid (you are the cleric) are you really going to be looking for a wizard when you can have a mage who can summon items for the casters, and who comes with their own tank that won't need healing. Or perhaps a rogue or other melee type. Wizards are at the bottom of the list (right behind Shadow Knights another favorite class of mine).<br>
<br>
Other players see us as being a very redundant class created specifically for raiding and soloing. Though we all know this to be false, there's really no reason they should not think as they do. If you were to take away a druid's or a shaman's or a necro's nukes you would still have a very good class for any situation. Take away a mage's nukes, and you still have a great summoner. Take away a clerics nukes and you have... a cleric. However, a Wizard <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> her/his nukes, take ours away and you have a taxi, and now that our blasts aren't getting any bigger (from 51 - 60) no one sees what we are doing for the group unless we get a crit.<br>
<br>
Ok, yes, I can solo, and yes, I am needed on raids; but who wants to spend their EQ life soloing and waiting for raids? 3.5 of the casting classes can heal, most can buff (or summon items that act as buffs) and all casting classes (even rangers!) have nukes and in many casses they are equivilent to ours in terms of damage. Since damage is all anyone else really cares about, there really isn't a point it compairing mana or casting time. Sure when someone sees me chain casting Draught of Fire on some mobe that has just ripped a whole in my robe they are extremly impressed, but not so much so that they want me in a group. Why? Because the same thing that makes us who we are (at least at 51+) is the same thing that makes is a liability <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> hard fast nukes!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Sure, I know that many of us know how not to get into trouble (without our Epic or <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> uber</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> gear) but the perception is out there.<br>
<br>
I personally don't know what at this point could be done to fix it, but until it is I will only play my Wizard when my roommate needs a teleport (and since he's dating a druid I'm sure that won't be too often).<br>
<br>
*wow! this ended up being much longer that it was supposed to be. sorry about that everyone.*<br>

It's all situational.  However, I am not going to just stand there and wait till I need to twitch.  The cleric gets what I have left.  If I chain casted my sorry ass nukes, and only have 30m to give ya, too bad.  I gotta learn to manage my mana much better if that happens though.<br>
<br>
If the group wizzie wants mana so he can do more nukes, well, he better be going for exp on the kill or else it isn't happening.  Typically, I don't twitch anyone other than cleric or group healer during a raid.<br>

Many necromancers have enough trouble getting into pickup groups and on raids in large part because of ignorance and here he is adding to it. I'm going to leave off the child molesting comments they are just too insane to even being to address. <br>
<br>
What I want to talk about is necromancers and grouping. If you think for one second that necromancers, at any level, are useless in groups then you haven't learned your class and tried it. There are many things that a necromancer can do and if you are reasonably intelligent and have reasonable knowledge of our class you can be of great use in a group and on a raid. No I'm not going to go into detail it would take too long but if anyone doubts it or wants to discuss it send me an email at asparkygirl@aol.com. <br>
<br>
Mags find a group and learn how to play, then you might understand.<br>
<br>
About twitching, it is obviously a touchy subject among necromancers and I will not speak for anyone but myself. I have no problem twitching, on occasion when it is really needed. I do however have a huge problem with it being the only reason I'm asked on a raid or into a group.<br>
 <br>
I will very rarely twitch in a group and its only if someone is dying and the cleric is oom I will twitch enough for a heal then I suggest that the puller stop pulling and the cleric sit on their ass to regain mana like everyone else. There are way more useful things I can be doing with my mana and if the group is too slow I'll go solo. It's not my fault if people can't manage agro, their mana or the speed of the pulls. Being a twitch bitch is just too boring.<br>
<br>
Now on a raid if I can't land spells or lifetap the crap out of a mob then well then twitching gives me something to do but I will not do this in experience groups there is just not reason for it. <br>
<br>
The thing I object to the most is the close mindedness of many people and of their refusal to accept that there might be other things, like causing several K in damage during a long fights, that we can do a lot better and much more efficiently than throwing away more than half our mana while giving it to someone else.<br>
<br>
And yes I realize that in most fights the mob doesn't really stay alive long enough for my dots to work to their full potential but then again, there are places where they do and I do have other options.<br>

<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> If you were to take away a druid's or a shaman's or a necro's nukes you would still have a very good class for any situation. Take away a mage's nukes, and you still have a great summoner. Take away a clerics nukes and you have... a cleric. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You see here I have stated just some of the things that other classes have to offer groups that do not incluse nuking. A dead mob is a dead mob. It doesn't matter to most groups out there if it dies in 20 seconds or in 10. All that matters is the groups readyness to move on at the end of the fight or at the end of a number of fights. Now is most situations, I can keep my mana at the same level or higher than the cleric and still do pleny of damage.<br>
<br>
When the puller says, 'Can we take 6...? Cause... um... well... I'm coming back with 6.' Most people in the group are thinking evac whereas I'm thinking, 'I know I can kill 3... and they should be able to keep me alive long enough to finish off the rest...' So when the mobs show up and the tanks engage them; at some point during the fight the ranger (or whoever) says,' what happened to the other three that I pulled, I simply say, 'I killed them.' At the end of the fight I'm totaly Out of Mana and the cleric usually has about 40 and everyone is pretty healthy.<br>
<br>
So what's the problem here? The problem is at the end of that fight I announce that I am Oom and the cleric says 40% the tanks are thinking to themselves that I am pretty much useless and wondering why they didn't get hte druid. Its all about perception. They don't actually see what it is that I'm doing for them (unless during that fight I land a crit).<br>

My AoE nukes are crappy for the level (don't have Al'Kabor's and can't find the *^^( runes for the other level 16s) but I've been able to save us from overpulls through careful use of aoes and rooting mobs of the group's healer.  Yeah, I go OOM, but I have not had anyone express any disappointment in my damage output or mana management.<br>

<br>
Seems while the Cat's away the Mice will Play.<br>
<br>
Still on your Knees Ladies?<br>
<br>
Gets rough down there doesn't it?<br>
<br>
Check our Class Board. Haven't been a 37 for a LONG time. I just never bothered to update my SIG.<br>
<br>
Something you Ladies don't seem to understand is this:<br>
<br>
TWITCHING Divides Our Class. Others have noticed this. The Wizard asked the Question WITHOUT PROMPTING on my part (see Page 1). I have ALWAYS been a Militant Mecromancer. This just didn't fall out of the Blue.<br>
<br>
I'm NOT the only Old School. Just the LOUDEST. Getting rid of me might very well make you happy but what do you do about my Brothers &amp; Sisters? Someone else will come along &amp; what do you do then? Start screaming again?<br>
<br>
You might also keep in mind that NO ONE on our Class Board was able to prove that I &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ANYWHERE&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Lied to the Wizard about ANYTHING. Trying to discredit our History &amp; I will point you right at the Archives every time.<br>
<br>
This leaves you with Shooting the Messanger.<br>
<br>
That never works because the Message is still Laying there in Plain Sight. This is like fighting ideas.<br>
<br>
You can always rip into me here or anywhere else but when you do the Lurkers just MIGHT start asking &quot;He IS a pain in the Butt but WHY are they acting like he murdered the Pope&quot;?<br>
<br>
You also can rest assured that I'll never lay back &amp; just take it.<br>

The vast majority of us do not support his views.<br>
<br>
Also in his statements that necromancers are useless in raids and in groups, please remember that he is level 37, he has never been on a raid or in a high end group.<br>
<br>
Oh and to the original poster of this thread ( Heh I am sure the issue is moot now =p ), If youre a twink, pick up a solists icy wand and some sow potions, that will make your early solo career MUCH easier. <p>WC3: <a href=http://www.battle.net/war3/ladder/data/PlayerProfile.aspx?PlayerName=ickhor&Gateway=Lordaeron>Ickhor</a> Lordaeron US-West<br>

Thank you but you might be burned at the stake for it. I cause trouble in my Class &amp; alot would like to see me walled up in a Cave. Which leads to the Intresting Question of what would they do when the Next One came along?<br>
<br>
Mid 40's (as an Officer in my Guild I'm required to go on certain Events. Tonight a fool pulled the ENTIRE KING ROOM on top of us. I may go back to Soloing as if you set up you EXP Camp correctly you atleast get to keep your Level).<br>
