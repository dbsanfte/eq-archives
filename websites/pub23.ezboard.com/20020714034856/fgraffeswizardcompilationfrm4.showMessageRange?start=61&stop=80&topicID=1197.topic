First - some very funny shit gets posted.<br>
ie when they call Seru unkillable (then scratch it out the very next week)<br>
<br>
Second - like it or not FoH does beta test... and VI does listen to them.  They get to the content first.  They can see if it's broken or not. (rather them then me wasting my time)<br>
<br>
Third - FoH has sodomized my cat.  <br>

Fouth - if Furor can see that the Emp has a fucked up loot table and it can potentially benefit me if VI changes it.  GREAT.<br>

work on PR? What the heck are you talking about?  The way FoH churns through new content you think the VI employees who troll their webpage care about the profane way in which they convey information?<br>

Some people like the fact that they don't have to be eloquent in online forums....all of this 'FoH hate' unless it comes from the fact that they ks you, train you constantly on veeshan etc...is just bullshit.<br>

Hi, i've never met furor, but because foh keeps killing everything first and then makes comments like 'yep yep, our cack is the biggest' it's obvious he's an asshole...yeah...right....If you don't like it, don't go to their fucking page.<br>
<br>
The irony here is a few of the 'parry mods' and stuff he asked for showed up in later loot from VT...heh, the VI employees read the FoH board to figure out how to design loot, that's what should be bugging you guys, not the fact that Furor beats you all to new mobs and rubs it in your faces maybe?

<br>
I think most of the &quot;hate&quot; here stems from comments made by FoH members.  I also think it's clear that Furor is an asshole, but that doesn't particularly bother me because I won't ever have to deal with him.  <br>
<br>
Your contention that everyone who hates FoH must be a sore loser is obviously bogus.  I'll never be anywhere near a high-end guild.  Hell, my bard's still in partial lambent and my guild is only now almost done with HoT.  I don't care about ub4r l3wtz or serverwide firsts and I'd wager that many players feel the same way.<br>
<br>
FoH members have made one thing entirely clear, however: they want no changes that change the endgame.  That's succeeded in pissing a number of people off, particularly since Verant's developers do indeed seem to listen to them.  When discussing focus items and caster balancing in general, the most common reaction from people who've experienced the endgame is &quot;Wizards need no help.&quot;  When confronted with pre-60 wizards who feel underpowered in many situations, the response changes to &quot;Sorcerors need no help and levels before 60 don't really mean anything.&quot;  A few people claim situational weakness, ignoring the fact that a few simple changes would greatly improve the playing experience for people who HATE soloing but aren't really wanted in a group.  This is generally followed by an irrelevant argument over xp efficiency (not everyone cares about getting to 60 or leveling quickly).<br>
<br>
Now that focus items (I'm not arguing that they're an effective method of caster balancing) are out, the same people who felt that they needed no boost aren't interested in seeing said foci on the players who feel underpowered.  No, it has nothing to do with keeping the lowbies down, but it does serve to (again) piss people off.  Let me quickly remind you how this might look to a lower leveled caster: citing risk vs. reward, progression of equipment upgrades and the fact that wizards are balanced at 60, a relatively small group of players is saying that they should be the only ones getting the &quot;good&quot; focus items.  Understand why some people are annoyed?<br>
<br>
No, I'm not trying to start another argument over FIs.  I personally disagree with Verant's implementation and hope that something is done about it soon.  I'm just explaining how the thread started by Furor when mage summoned FIs were released might have served to annoy lower leveled wizards who feel underpowered.<br>

Life is full of irony if you're stupid.  Of course Verant's devs are going to listen to FoH suggestions when it comes to tuning loot and no one resents them for that.  As I said before, most don't care about the serverwide firsts either.  It's the attitude that only the endgame matters that annoys some people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=raistinfoh>Raistin FoH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/02 10:47:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1197.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> lmao</span><hr size=1>  I have no clue where you people get &quot; The kids play 60 hrs a week!1&quot; and other bullshit.

You're absolutely right.  No one (besides a significant other, perhaps) should give a damn about how much time another person spends playing EQ.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, who needs to think about it?  It's generally acknowledged that being in an &quot;uber&quot; guild requires a greater time commitment than a casual gamer is willing to make.  Are you really trying to claim that a MAJORITY of active FoH members play only 18 hrs/week?  I call bullshit on you!<br>

And here we come to the crux of the post.  Obviously, everyone who has said anything against FoH or its members must have penis envy at 12.  Petty shit?  The only ones mentioning penis size and animal rape are FoH members and friends.  To me, that sort of rhetoric is infinitely more petty than anything said by Onail who was, after all, only going by the comments on your webpage:<br>

<br>
2nd - As this isn't an Anti-FoH thread i assume that the hat fitted perfectly for you. By the tone of your post the thread really must have gotten deep on you.<br>
<br>
3rd - Actually i do work all day from 7:30 AM - 12:00 AM<br>
and then 1:30 PM - 5:30 PM, and after i get out of work i go to college from 7:00 PM - 10:30 PM, and only then at around 11:00 PM (if im not to sleepy) i play EQ until 1:00 AM or so and thats why  my necro who was created on february 2000 is still level 49. <br>

4th - Anyone willing to hit the reply button read this post carefully and see that there is not a single attack to FoH's. And to Raistin i only posted what i felt while reading his very flamed post.<br>

At least im &quot;hiding&quot;(as if i had other options to talk to you) behind a message board and not being what i am not behind EQ.<br>
<br>
Oh oh... i just reminded that once Milaru told me that this is the rant board and you dont have to make sense in here, just have fun and blast away. Based on Milaru's comment(wich i agree) i will consider 5% of the Army part of the post.<br>
<br>

ps: I went to army for one year here in Brazil, actually all Brazilians that hit the age of 18 must attend to army and only the ones with phisycal problems or disease or bad stuff are dismissed from service.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uluxum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 10:15:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1197.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bulls eye!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Anyone willing to hit the reply button read this post carefully and see that there is not a single attack to FoH's. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

No, this post was about an acidic Furor comment on the poor drop rate of Garrison's!  Just because some people with a chip on their shoulder over some players they've never even met hijacked the thread to make useless judgement calls on the relative value of those people they've never met's social lives, does not mean that is what the post was about.  Pay attention!  You want to talk about EQ addiction, hit that new thread button and don't use made up assumptions about players you don't know to prove your points. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uonail2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Onail2 </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 10:33:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1197.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ok</span><hr size=1> I mentioned in a post on the other day that the post about him dieing swiflty blah blah was the only attack, sorry i forgot about it on my last post.<br>

Furor = Treatment Won't help. Thats my sarcastic opinion on someone that surely waste most of his time in EQ or doing stuff for the game. <br>
<br>
The post was about the spell dropping, i agree, but i am not sure if you noticed that the post was HIJACKED and now it is about ADDICTION..(hmmmm maybe it is about bitching now lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). So as the post got moved to Rants forum and people changed subject it would be easier for you to start a new post about the spell dropping the bringing this one back to the first topic hehe.<br>

The whole problem here is that people like you are sitting here acting like you know how much Furor plays, whether he is an addict and needs help, blah blah blah, has no life, blah blah blah.

I don't know if it is a valid way to consider that, but AA points can tell how much someone plays. I am not attacking him , just saying in a rant way that he might be addicted to the game, i sure can't say that i know it but i clearly stated before that i was giving MY OPINION.<br>
<br>
And now i rest my case. I got enough of this crap and im tired of trying to show people that there is life beyond EQ. I don't even know why the fuck i care. I think it is a Brazilian thing, we are really friendly down here, maybe its the weather, not sure, but oh as many here say, WHO THE FUCK CARES. I hate selfish people.<br>

His profile is very impressive and you bet i would like to have a character like his. The only problem is that i would have to give up on a lot of things in my life to dedicate to EQ...<br>
<br>
Well, give up on life or hope for EQ to be around in about 20 years from today <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

When I started playing EQ, sometime around Nov or Dec of 1999, Furor was already level 50 and had been for some time. <br>
<br>
Given the amount of time he's been 60, I would hope his profile is impressive and as for AA points, If all you had to do is get AAXP every time you logged in, you would probably have a butt load of them too. <p><Br><b>Castwell Fizzlebuner </b></br>
