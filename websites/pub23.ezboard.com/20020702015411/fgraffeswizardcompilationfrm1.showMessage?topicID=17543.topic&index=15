A few things I wanted to point out about your method of calculating % uptime.  The assumption in your calculations, which is perfectly correct for 95% of the situations if that wizards 'do' damage even when not engaged in a fight.<br>
<br>
I agree that while pulling mobs, very rarely should a good wizard ever be at full mana, but you also have to consider if you are trying to consider uptime, 2 hours spent with a consistent 50% uptime, are very different than 2 hours spent with 75% uptime, with a half an hour break in the middle so clerics could get lunch, paladin had to change his son's nappy (don't laugh, happens a fair bit with a friend, hehe) so wizards probably cease benefitting from downtime after 2 or 3 minutes.<br>
<br>

<br>
That being said, soon as I finish the cabbage quest, I will be parsing more results with my warrior. My idea is that in constant pull groups, the uptime will average 80%. This is supposing that you always have enough mobs to pull, which happens on the server I play on.<br>
<br>
I calculate DPS on my warrior by counting the time spent in combat ( = the time between me hitting autoattack on, and turning it off) and the time spent at camp (this is given by the log) and dividing it.<br>
<br>
I do not think that the 'general uptime' formula proposed is a good way of measuring uptime. For one thing, the number of people in the zone is going to vary, some groups might be better than others. The formula proposed is merely an approximation of the average uptime for all the people in the zone. I understand now why figures proposed are so low. General uptime is probably much higher than 50%, provided you have a good puller. I will also parse logs pulling a mob once the mob is dead. (this gives 70%uptime imo)<br>
<br>
I'll post my results here in a bit (prolly bout one week)<br>
<br>
<br>
Filastil (and Armok): I think the reason that the DPS goes down when uptime goes up is an artifact of Armok's wizard algorithm. I also do not agree with this. For me, when uptime increases, the wizard damage should stay constant, with the value : best DD damage / mana cost * (manaregen per second) The only reason this value could go down would be if at some point the wizard is full mana and has no mobs to use his mana on.<br>
<br>
I believe that in Armok's calculations, the (manaregen per second) goes *down* when uptime increases, to take into account the fact it is harder to med. I think that this is exxagerated, and that manaregen per second should be remain constant in calculations, regardless of the uptime of the group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufilastilapplepie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Filastil Applepie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/14/02 6:17:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17543.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> I agree that it has to be an error in the formula.

<br>
I take logs also. And my assumptions are just as valid as the 'uptime calculation formulas' given here. Let me elaborate further:<br>
<br>
- For me, the TDPS that a wizard can do is directly proportional to his mana regen, ASSUSMING that he never is full mana and just hanging around (I will assume this in the rest of the discussion). I also assume the wizard does not have a nuke item (I have a Velious nuke robe but well they are not all that great. That being said I do use mine from time to time). This means you can dump a mana bar on a mob then med ten minutes, or you can dump a spell on a mob and med 30 seconds staying virtually at full mana (for 'gameplay reasons, it is of course better to stay around 60 mana, in order to give yourself the possibility to regain more mana up if longer downtime occurs.)<br>
<br>
Having said that, you are *never* going to exceed the TDPS you will get medding all the time, and just standing for 4 seconds and casting.<br>
<br>
Your group does not need 'downtime' in order to let you regain mana. If you are low, then simply meditiate through a fight while your friends pound on the mob. Sure you are not contributing for this fight, but by medding you are regaining mana in order to contribute to your overall TDPS, whose value is the formula I gave in previous post (best dmg / mana cost * (mana regen per second)<br>
<br>
It is *possible* to meditate while a group fights a mob, you seem to imply this is not the case, but believe me I've been doing this for a very long time. From what you say Grim, I seem to feel you have an 'aggressive' casting style, while I might consider mine to be mostly 'moderate', and I do exactly what I have explained here when I am in an xp group : I will med all the time, regardless of whether mobs are in the camp or not, and I will cast if I am over 60%. If a mob has high life, then I will wait a bit (med some more) before blasting, so that after my blast I will be able to sit and not draw aggro. If I do draw aggro, then I will stand up again (thus losing it) and I will cast another spell or 2 to end the fight, so that I do not lose time standing and *not casting*. For me, if I am standing, I must be casting, or else indeed my manaregen per second is going to decrease. I could elaborate more my tactics in a different thread on how to 'maximise' my efficiency from the meditation / casting point of view, which are of course much more complicated than what I just described, but this would be off topic.<br>
<br>
Finaly, Armok's 'research' is based on logs, but it is provided by FORMULAS that he calculated, taking into account a lot of parameters, but are *not* the results of parsed logs at 30% uptime, 50% uptime etc... (unless I am mistaken of course, but this is what I understand the 'spreadsheets' to be), so I think that my propositions and questions are valid for a 'scientific' point of view: he proposes a model, shows the results his models give. I do not disagree with this very 'scientific' way of presenting things, but I find some results surprising. Since he has not completely detailled all the model (although some has filtered out now with the uptime values model for instance), I can only *assume* what he *might* have taken into account in the model (such as reduced mana regen when uptime goes up) in order to account for the results that his model predicts, and I *argue* against these assumptions.<br>

<br>
Elementary mathematics show that if I regain 20 mana per 6 seconds (imaginary figures just bear with me) and I have a DD that costs 200 mana and does 600 damage, that means I can cast 1 DD per minute. If I cast more, I will go OOM, and then I will have to med for 1 minute in order to get enough mana back to cast 1 DD. My TDPS will be 600 damage per minute, thus 10 DPS  *REGARDLESS* of the number of mobs that my group will have killed in that time. If in 1 minutes time my group can kill 10 mobs, my TDPS will be the same. If in 1 minute my group can kill 1 mob, my TDPS will be the same. The only thing that changes is the TDPS of the members of my group.<br>
<br>
However, with extremely low uptime, if you ever get full mana *THEN* your TDPS will be going down.<br>
<br>
So to sum up my assumptions and conclusions:<br>
<br>
Assumptions:<br>
- you can always med<br>
- the only time you are standing is when you are casting<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
- manaregen per minute is constant<br>
- when uptime goes up, wizard TDPS goes up and hits a limit of damage/cost*(mana regen per minute)<br>
<br>
I hope you understand what I mean, I am not simply tossing around words lightly, I have logical ideas to back them up. you seem to assume that meditate time is proportional to downtime I *strongly disagree* with this, due to my personal experience of aggro and meditation in 'xp' groups.<br>

<br>
First off, Aurore is correct on a couple points:<br>
<br>
1) Wizard damage output (TDPS/DPH) is not truly a straight-line graph in the real world, indicating an error in the forumla.<br>
<br>
2) The model by itself is not a proof, and real world results will vary from the predicted values.<br>
<br>
Lets look at #1 first:<br>
<br>
There are two errors in the mana regen formula (which Elasto pointed out assumes 50% of combat time (uptime) is spent in meditation). Those errors are at the low end of uptime, where the wizard in question would spend a significant amount of time at FM (the death of wizard damage potential -- I wonder how many frogs are alive today because of time I spent auctioning in Faymart). At some point, the model is pretty accurate (Mean Value Theorem): If you are unable to sit because of agro, you won't be able to nuke either, or you will throw in a Concussion <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> and casts of concussion which allow you to sit and meditate secretly find their way into this part of the formula</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. At the high uptime side of the equation there is another error, because my formula does not account for entire fights where the wizard sits out to med up. The final curve should thus be something like a sideways (and mirrored <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) 'S': At the very low end of uptime, it quickly falls off to zero, in the middle the trendline is slightly downward (because of missed meditation opportunities due to agro), and at the far right end it levels off or has a slight upward trend. One of the main reasons I grabbed the middle portion of the uptime range (30-70%) is that it lops off the two ends where error would be present.<br>
<br>
I offer anyone here to come up with a mathematical model for this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ... note that accurately accounting for mana lost to FM is very difficult to measure.<br>
<br>
Others have also pointed out that the formula breaks down when downtime is experienced when play for the group just stops for an extended period of time (15-30 minutes, for example). To be honest, I have not seen much of this at all in any of my play (especially in pickup groups), as most times when this happens, one player goes off and the rest keep grinding, or they are replaced.<br>
<br>
Finally, as Sildiven pointed out (and Aurore later agreed): Wizard damage output very quickly reaches the maximum potential (where you aren't losing mana to FM). From my logs, I would guess that this would be somewhere in the 25-30% uptime range.<br>
<br>
Now for #2:<br>
<br>
The model is definitely not a proof. In fact, my initial reason for making the spreadsheet was for the graphing capability, because without pictures, face it: I'd lose 95% of my audience (hell, I lose 60% of them even with pictures <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) But then, once I got the basic chart, I played around with some forumlas to model the damage, and the rest is history.<br>
<br>
My goal was to follow the scientific method, and to be fair, I only got halfway there.  <br>
Scientific method:<br>
1) observe data<br>
2) derive a model to predict future results<br>
3) collect more data and compare to prediction from #2<br>
<br>
I did step 1 &amp; 2 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My model is not 100% accurate, but it's probably somewhere in the 90% range. There really isn't much room for additional damage, given the proper inputs.  Here's the wiggle room:<br>
1) I assume spells are 90% effective (rest is lost to fizzles, resists/partials, and corpse nuking)<br>
2) Meditation forumla (when not using click nukes)<br>
3) Right click nuke efficiency<br>
<br>
Right click nuke formula is much trickier, and it depends on average fight time and click nuke activation time (for example: you won't get many Velious quest robe nukes in when the fights last an average of 20 seconds), but at least it takes the meditation issue out of the equation. I plan to start another thread to illustrate this formula in detail (primarily in hopes to get more click nukes added and fix for the gawdawful cast time on the velious quest robes).<br>
<br>
I should also note that on the original topic of computing average uptime it may be that my logs have an inherent flaw: the observer effect. Groups I joined tended to have lower downtime because high uptime groups wouldn't select a wizard anyway. This did not apply to some camps where we ran out of mobs, but I mention it here anyway.<br>
<br>
Back to the original topic: calculating average downtime. The formula I gave actually is a mathematical imperative (as opposed to the statistical speculation present from my charts), but using it to calculate average uptime in a zone will almost certainly over-estimate it because it is much more likely to measure uptime potential than actual uptime. For our purposes, however, over-estimating uptime is fine (since my theory is that average uptime is much lower than most expect).<br>
<br>
For those interested in calculating uptime from logs, picking uptime reported by a melee parse is actually very good (and better than counting time when mobs are in camp) because it gives the actual figure that melee must use when computing their damage output. Since the goal is to compare melee damage output to wizard damage output, this uptime figure will give the proper value for the graph.<br>
<br>
Note that my subjective observations on uptime surprised me: it was much lower than I expected in frantic groups (60%) and much higher than I expected in boring groups (35%). This, and the fact that actual recorded results for extended camps tend to be far below 100% is why I am such a stickler about this.<br>
<br>
A couple other points to wrap up:<br>

<br>
I can say that recently I have started to figure out how to stay productive in +60% uptime groups (the same group that I have done exp with exclusively for the last 3 levels and 8 aa points) by casting constantly (mana robe+epic). When I started joining this group (60 cle, war, enc, mon, rog, me) I was only lvl 57, and I was CLEARLY getting power leveled by my friends. It almost broke my heart to see that they were doing several thousands dmg per mob when I had to cast between 1-4 spells per mob (usually snare at least). I know that constant dmg is what is required in a grind group, and I also see the benefit of landing the 1200 dmg ice spear when a mob is enraged, so there is some benefit from on demand dmg vs constant.<br>
<br>
After I got my epic, I noticed that I was more free to nuke because I did not &quot;waste&quot; the clerics mana by requiring a heal. (kudos for me that the last log file I did was for about an hour and a half, and I only got 1 heal during that time) I also noticed a marked improvement from fighting in Seb/Chardok to fighting in CT where I sit on my horse! I LOVE CT for grind groups now. I also noticed a huge increase again when our monk lent me the Mana Robe that she purchased. On my last trip to CT, I was sitting on my horse, using a mana robe, and staying between 70-85% mana constantly (would nuke down to 40% if I knew we would be taking a short break). With that situation I went from nuking once per fight (pre horse and mana robe), to nuking 3-4 times per mob (using Ice Spear exclusively for efficiency). If I got summoned, and still had agro, I would cast concussion, but otherwise I would just mana robe off my epic skin until ice spear refreshed or I had to refresh epic (usually I would refresh epic after another ice spear though).<br>
<br>
I do believe that having a right click nuke that is efficient would increase our ability to do grind groups and be much more productive to the group (as opposed to what I do in Seb right now by getting out dmg'ed by a 57 SK by 20% not including all his dot's/proc's). Right click nukes, IMO, are the single biggest boost for casters because they provide a constant DPS regardless of mana pool / mana regen.  <p>Cryptix Fractalshot <BR><b>Veteran Crew</b><BR>

<br>
<br>
Most of my personal theoretical delvings into wizard balance have been entirely geared to quantifying this idea. Generally speaking, the relative worth of damage dealing is proportional to the DPS the group is taking at that time, neglecting whatever one time damage the mob might do before it gets mezzed or slowed or root parked. A wizard has the ability to save his damage for when the group can reap the most benefit, such as nuking when 2 unmezzable mobs are in camp, or when the enchanter is busy and can't slow the primary target, or burning down that illis froggie.<br>
<br>
However, this assumes a healing constrained situation which apparently does not always occur in practice. I haven't done the work on it when healers are generating a surplus yet, so I can't say what would happen in a non-healing constrained group. While the phenomenon would still appear, because the less healing the cleric has to do the more he can nuke, I would expect it to be less pronounced than in the healing constrained situation.<br>
<br>
Fast burning can cause some benefit beyond this too. The enchanter/shammie may be able to forego casting a slow on a mob that the enchanter burns away, giving them additional mana to spend on other things; every slow I don't cast means about 1800 extra damage for the group (though I have an Iceshatter, so I'm hardly your typical enchanter... but I would expect similar if not greater things for the aggressive shammie). I'm sure others can think up some additional situations too.<br>

I dont think I have yet seen an example on this board of a supposed 100% uptime group that wasnt in this zone. Near endless amounts of mobs that, at one point, were so easy that melee could solo them.

I must say I have not taken logs about uptime on my wizard because I find it very hard to judge, but as I say when I get back to playing my melee I will be getting some more data. It must also be possible to get some data from other level 60 melees who like parsing.<br>
<br>
I think this is the phase where the 'theretical' results are being compared to the empirical ones, so we are doing point (3) at the moment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't really think you can say FG screwed the high end game, I think it is just a game that helps melees out, and that is not a bad thing in itself. However, it would be interesting to have logs on melee uptime in places like Sebilis where you are actually crawling around also.<br>
<br>
New idea here : I think that we agree that *in general* (this means disregarding what happens for very low or very high values) wizard efficiency decreases when wizard uptime increases (without a nuke item), so interesting parsing for wizards means that we don't need to parse melee uptime, but wizard uptime. This can be done by making a 'sit' hotkey where you say '/g sitting' /sit on and a 'stand' hotkey where you '/g standing' /sit off. This would make it possible to calculate the actual time spend by the wizard medding. In the meantime, the melee uptime should be calculated (by using the simple time in combat / total time method) and we could make a table to see if there is a correlation between high MELEE uptime and high WIZARD uptime. My claim (which I do not have anything to back it up yet) is that these two uptimes are roughly independant. The claim others make is that wizard uptime goes up when melee uptime goes up (due for instance to the meditate aggro factor). I believe that the procedure I propose would be able to give interesting and novel results. Bear in mind that to do this, you need to have a melee friend who is ready to /log the data in the same group as you and parse it.<br>

Uptime connotes a time when you're actually doing something. A melee is meleeing exactly when he's experiencing uptime.<br>
<br>
What do you actually mean by wizard uptime? Time the wizard spends medding? The time he spends casting? The time he spends medding or casting? <br>
<br>
It's quite clear that the time a wizard spends medding and the uptime of the group are not independant. Specifically, a wizard is always medding during downtime, but the wizard is sometimes medding, sometimes casting, and sometimes standing to avoid aggro during uptime... so it is clear that wizard med time / overall damage / time spent casting is a statistic dependant on uptime.<br>
