Scream for nerfs or improvements for your class and justify your position based on one hybrid class that has overpowering spells.<br>
<br>
If you bring up wizards to a point where they are &quot;balanced&quot; with a decently equiped lvl 60 sk with HT up.  You will create more issues than you solve.<br>
<br>
If you nerf all melees based on how powerful a sk is you will again create far more problems than you solve.<br>
<br>
If you want a general nerf or a general improvement you must justify why this is a good thing overall and adress the new issues that will occur based on your change.<br>
<br>
I know no specific suggestions have been made so far in this thread though I'm still waiting for the often heard cries of &quot;Nerf melee dmg!' and &quot;No more spell dmg nerf!&quot;<br>
<br>
But this thread is entitled how do you fight melees and yet has become a discussion of how fubar sks are in pvp.<br>
<br>
Its important to note that all melees are NOT in the position of the sk or even close.  Any suggestions that are made after this point either need to be sk specific or take a larger view. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=whirln>Whirln</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/3/02 8:18:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> How to fight an SK / Nerf issues</span><hr size=1> Ok i'll start by saying that what your reading is absolutely correct.  Currently in pvp land the king is the SK.  A close second would be the Epic Necro / Mage (in my opinion).  Necro's can dot and just evade the SK.  If the SK fights the Necro's pet, more dotting will ensue and in a short amout of time the SK is toast.  Mage Pets are nasty... add similar DD's to a wiz and you have a powerful combo.  <br>
<br>
To fight an SK as a wizard you have to use your lures and alternate in a fast casting spell like Drought (pray it hits).  Skin has to be up, and you need to try and gain the advantage with first strike and stay above them with Levitate.  SS if necessary (i mem 2 Shadow Step and yonder that way if you launch a dud that doesnt get you far away, you cna immediatly re-cast).  If you cant get out of his mele range find a corner and wedge yourself in there.  That way he cant interrupt your casting.  Not real sure what you can do vs HT and his other mean spells but pray.<br>
<br>
How to fix us in pvp.  Undo the 60% nerf that they put on casting damage.  If VI removed that stupid nerf in the first place we might not have needed MB for PvP.  There is no nerf on the dot's damage, no nerf on mele damage, and the nerf really only affects Wizards.  If they undid the 60% only damage from DD spells wizards might be able to beat an SK, although it would still be very very hard. Just my suggestion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uusrbinperldashw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>usrbinperl dashw</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/4/02 4:36:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to fight an SK / Nerf issues</span><hr size=1> I haven't played PvP in a loooooong time, but when I played on Rallos I had access to several characters, either my own or shared.  I played SK, Enchanter, Wizard, and Necro.  The SK was just impossible to nuke to death with just one caster if he was near full HP.  The only time I died in PvP as the SK was when a Wizard, Cleric, SK, and Warrior all attacked me at once, and even then I almost made it to the zone line.<br>
<br>
I didn't really PvP in the sense that I fought players who attacked me.  If I was leveling and someone attacked me, I usully conceeded the fight and headed for the zone or gated.  It's not wise to fight if you don't score the first strike (unless the other player is very incompetent and you know you can win).<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I PK for hundred of hours in High Keep and fought many twink melees with a Wiz/Enc/Nec.  Unless I had a caster partner, I never tried to take on a melee unless he was down to around 30% HP.  Best thing to do is team with an Enchanter and have them Cancle Magic, Tash, and Blind.  Then have the Enc keep alternating blind and root while you stand back and nuke.  A blinded melee is worthless, but a blinded caster can still cast if you know what you're doing.<br>
<br>
But like I said, that was a loooong time ago and I don't know how much things have changed since then. <p><CENTER>

The nerf is 2/3 or around 66% not 60% btw.<br>
<br>
2. Dots ARE nerfed I have verified this by having my necro dot himself and comparing dmg done (adjusted for natural regen) and compared the dmg done with the dmg listed on eqcaster.<br>
3. Highkeep is full of heavily twinked lvl 20ish to 30ish people.  I don't really consider that a good test.<br>
<br>
4. No balance decisions should be made based on low to mid lvl pvp with casters facing heavily twinked melees. If balance is achieved between casters and twinked low to mid lvl melees what position do you think the rest of us melees are going to be in?<br>
<br>
5. No balance decisions should be made based on uber equiped players.  Most of us arn't and will as above be in a very poor position.<br>
<br>
6. No balance decision that will effect ALL melees should be made with one overpowered class in mind.<br>
<br>
Did you ever see my idea for spell dmg reduction tables? It goes like this...<br>
<br>
Each table would describe the dmg reduction percentage for that class depending on what class they were facing.<br>
<br>
Each class has a table for each lvl range.  1-19, 20-28, <br>
29-38, 39-48, 49-54, 55-60 might be an apropriate break down for int casters giving them an updated table for each 2 tiers they go up in spells. <br>
<br>
To give an example...<br>
<br>
-------------------WIZARD TABLE 49-54--------------------<br>
DMG REDUCTION VS Wizards         X%<br>
DMG REDUCTION VS Magicians       X%<br>

<br>
Heres one idea if you want to kill a melee indoors. Nuke him once, laugh at him and zone out get him where YOU want him.  If you piss him off enough he will follow you.<br>
<br>
If the melee has no signifigant means to regen health like a velious bp you can use hit and run tactics to run down their hp from max range without giving him a good chance to follow.  If used successfully you must really engage them before they drop too low in hp or they will just back off and head out.<br>
<br>
Ok opinions here... A 60 wiz even without AA isn't really weak.<br>
<br>
60 spells make a difference.<br>
Epic skin makes a substantial difference.<br>
Uber channeling at 60 makes a huge difference.  <br>
<br>
At least from my experience fighting 60s it seems its no longer a matter of can I keep them from casting, I can't without bash.  Its a matter of can I take them out fast enough to live through it.<br>
<br>
Bind in bizaar junk buff yourself fully then buy aego.  Port to the location that you wish to pvp in.<br>
<br>
Keep all neccesary mage focus items on a corpse when you log off if you can.  For pvp vs a pure melee you mainly need dmg focus range and haste.<br>
<br>
Aquire your epic and keep it up.<br>
<br>
Get a coldain ring or use a shaman ds potion. Its expensive (around 40pp a potion) to get the good stuff but it gives you a 31 point ds at 60)<br>
<br>
Put 2 insta clicky buffs in your first 2 buff slots and refresh them if dispelled.<br>
<br>
Don't annul a pure melee unless you have good reason to think hes buffed.<br>
<br>
For gods sake don't try to root them, not even that ghetto cold root.  Its futile unless they are a retard.<br>
<br>
Put on hp/ac (more hp than ac 30% more hp directly translates into 30% more dmg you can do and live) gear over everything else.  Maintain at least 70-100mr though just in case.  Maintain additional situational resists if neccesary.<br>
<br>
You will need +manna stuff for uber melees and plate tanks but for the low hp melees don't sweat it you could probably kill them with lures with the manna you have naked.  Get HP up.<br>
<br>
Don't be a dipshit and interupt your own spells when you would easily have channeled.  When not being bashed 60 wizards channel to a godly extent.<br>
<br>
Don't sit their and get pummeled through the  full cast time.  Move around and kite but don't be a wuss.  Especially if you have aego and epic skin + hp gear.<br>
<br>
Find a strategy in the middle and don't be afraid to take some damage.<br>
<br>
It might help you learn how to move better in pvp vs a melee to play a low lvl melee char.  I know playing a caster a bit effected how I fought them.<br>
<br>
Even indoors you potentially have a pretty free range of motion and can use levitate, position and in zone gate to your advantage.<br>
<br>
Example: Nuke gate to a nearby hidden point run out and nuke them again from behind repeat.<br>
<br>
Example: Levitate across the bridge area near the zone to Great divide in thurg.<br>
<br>
Example: Open the doors leading out to great divide inside thurgadin nuke the melee run through the doors closing them as you run.  They take time to finish closing and open again.  Use this time to nuke the melee.<br>
<br>
Don't stick around if you get jumped inside.  Always take the initiative and jump them first. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=atmas>Atmas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/16/02 9:51:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re</span><hr size=1> Yeah I can basically just say use lure if you got it.  Hopefully your channeling is good enough so that you can cast under being hit.  Yonder or shadowstep in areas that it is appropriate.  Skin ofcourse if you have it is very usefull because it absorbs life tap damage and gives no health to the Sk.  Thats real important because they have to pause to lifetap and it gives you a chance to get a free cast off.<br>
