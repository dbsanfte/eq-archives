I know they will get tossed around here like a tennis ball.  Even if VI does look at them no action will be taken on their part.<br>
<br>
I will list my ideas according to my idea of their priority.  And yes everyone will have different priorities and opinions.<br>
<br>
1)  Allow Wizards, and other casters, greater access to mana regen items.<br>
2)  Allow all casters greater access to class specific loot, which helps the caster.<br>
3)  Place even more level restrictions on loot. <br>
4)  Reduce the level of aggression generated by all our spells.<br>
5)  Reduce the mana cost of all our spells.  <br>
6)  Create more items such as Icy's soloist wand.  It has a low casting time and decent damage.  AND don't make they drop from the most difficult mobs in the game.<br>
7)  Allow our spells to grow in damage for many more levels.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Reduce the casting time of many of our spells (mainly pre-50).<br>
9)  Redesign the Rain series of spells to only have ONE resistance check.<br>
10)  Either explain the initial ideas behind the Al'Kabor line or remove the line for more PBAEs and Rains.<br>
<br>
Now starts the explanation section:<br>
<br>
1)  Allow Wizards, and other casters, greater access to mana regen items.<br>
Mana is the bread and butter of the classes discussed here.  So increasing the mana regen on these classes would go a long way to increasing the damage output and also groupiblity.  Melee classes are able to get haste items with greatly increase their power as early as level one, as long as they have the cash.  Casters have to wait until much later (post 50) to get a much smaller benefit.  Even if there was an item that gave 100 mana per tick, down time would still hinder Wizard performance in Exp groups.  After a full burn a wizard would have to wait 3 mins at lave 60 with 255 int to get back to FM.  We all know there will never be a way to get 100 mana per tick.  Plus melee Haste items do not take up a buff slot while all mana regen benefits do.<br>
<br>
2)  Allow all casters greater access to class specific loot, that helps the caster.<br>
I know caster loot has been look upon as a low priority in the past.  Why because casters get spells.  Well that was fine pre-expansions.  But now that melees get disciplines, AA points, and with the elimination of the 200 hard code on Int.  All the casters need more loot, and not only the loot off Uber Mobs.  But also make the loot meaningful, for instance why would a wizard want a piece of equipment that gives +25 mana post-50?  Considering most of the wizard spells post-50 have a mana cost of 200-500 mana.  What’s 25 extra points?  Also why give wizards class specific gear that has a lot of Sta post-35?  Oh it’s nice to have extra hps but when our AC is so low those extra hps are useless.   <br>
<br>
3)  Place even more level restrictions on loot. <br>
There is NO reason for a level 30 warrior to be allowed to use a Wyrmslayer and a Centi long sword.  Especially when a wizard of similar level is restricted to only using damage spells which were created prior to any expansion coming out.  This created a Vicious circle, which VI will never be able to keep up with.  If a level 30 is able to use these weapons it unbalances the classes.  Then once the character gains levels they want new weapons, which VI creates to keep the upper level game interesting, which in turn unbalances the upper levels.  Because the new items are in the game they start ending up on the lower level characters as well.  So basically the casters have been unbalanced on purpose in an effort of keeping EQ with a player based economic system without any constraints.<br>
<br>
4)  Reduce the level of aggression generated by the entire wizard DD and epic spells.  <br>
I see no reason why when I am on a Raid with 15 melees each doing 70-90 points of damage per swing, 3-4 swings per tick.  My one draught spell can cause enough aggression to any mob, for the mob to come after me.  I have seen on many occasions melees Crits hitting for 350+ and still the mob can come after me.  I feel the spell Concussion was a cop out.  They threw it in as an after thought, because it does not solve the problem.  It only takes up a spell slot. <br>
<br>
5)  Reduce the mana cost of all wizard spells.<br>
Wizards use the most mana.  Why because our spells on average have the highest mana cost out of all the casting classes.  The 3 casting classes that have the lowest mana cost per spell also have mana regen buffing spells.  Enchanters, Shaman and Necros (no offense was intended). <br>
<br>
  <br>
6)  Create more items such as Icy's soloist wand, which have a low casting time and decent damage.  AND don't make they drop from the most difficult mobs in the game.<br>
When a caster is out of mana they are effectively useless.  Especially the wizard, because wizards have been given the added responsibility of Evac.  Therefore if a wizard is responsible for evac they now have even less mana then any other caster.  Items that cast DD/Dot spells will allow for the caster to remain part of the party/game.<br>
<br>
7)  Allow our spells to grow in damage for many more levels.<br>
From a role-play perspective I do not understand this one.  From the good old days of AD&amp;D spells grew in strength as the caster grew in level.  In EQ VI has made a whole new series of spells, throwaway spells.  Currently once a caster makes a new spell level they then spend the next 20 mins scribing spells and moving the old spells to the back of their spell book to never be used again.  I have suggested in the past that spells increase in power propionate to the mana/damage of each level.  That will increase the usage of older spells while not increasing the power of newly gained spells.  For instance a 49th wizard has a mana/damage ratio of 2.8.  My suggestion says that all the wizard DDs for that wizard at that level should have a mana/damage ratio of 2.8 all the way to level one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Reduce the casting time of many of our spells (mainly pre-50).<br>
Why are casters forced to wait 6 seconds to cast a damage spell when a single melee will out damage the caster before the spell even lands. <br>
<br>
9)  Redesign the Rain series of spells to only have ONE resistance check.<br>
These spells have the potential to be very useful.  Given the innate dangers already incorporated into the game concerning these spells, i.e. gaining aggro from a mob 2 stories above or below, low range, will the mob move, and high mana cost.  I don't understand why these spells must have a spell check for each wave that hits a mob.<br>
<br>
10)  Either explain the initial ideas behind the Al'Kabor line or remove the line for more PBAEs and Rains.<br>
Since the player base has not been able to figure out a reason why this series of spells was forced upon the player base since EQs conception.  Other factors in the game have really made this line of spells useless.  For instance the absurd increase of mob HPs, the inability to hit a mob if you cannot see it.<br>
<br>
Basically what I am thinking is that casters may get a little bit of relief here from VI.  It will be nowhere close to what it needs to be.  VI would have to change their whole way of thinking about casters for us to be balanced once again.  VI's Philosophy of casters get spells so they don't need equipment, weapons, resistance gear, or special abilities.  Has gone on long enough.  Casters are so far behind in the balance curve that I believe VI will have to restructure their whole spell system to accommodate any real balance between the casters and melee.  Since release I feel there have been some small improvements in the balance, but nothing great has been accomplished.<br>

Luclin has MANY more Flowing Thoughts items, and the problem I have with the current supply is that they did not add more flowing thoughts items to the rest of the game.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, Flowing Thoughts items will stack, up to a maximum of 15 mana/tick.  That's not bad, and doesn't take a buff slot(can't be dispelled), and stacks with the other mana regen spell effects.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, pre-Luclin, we had these available only from:<br>
Cazic Thule<br>
ToV named mobs<br>
Coldain Prayer Shawl 7(runed coldain prayer shawl)<br>
<br>
That was it.  On Luclin, it almost seems that most boss mobs(the level 60+ ones) all have a chance to drop a flowing thoughts item.<br>
<br>
I agree that the mana cost on spells is a bit high, which is why spellcasting mastery(Arch AA ability) is so good, it improves our chance to make a specialization check, which drops the mana cost on our spells.<br>
<br>
Crits are also good with the AA abilities, but I agree, why should we need to spend AA points for something that should be considered a normal ability?  In all fairness, wizards should get an inherant spell casting fury at lower levels as a part of class balance.<br>
<br>
For casters with an int(or wis) over 200, we should get what melees get, the ability to ALWAYS be able to cast a spell, though perhaps with a longer cast time(50 percent longer to cast the spell?).<br>
<br>
As it stands, we have downtime if we group or not, so why not balance us so that we get the same perks that melees get that ALLOW them to continually swing that heavy sword?  Why shouldn't we get crits with our spells without needing to spend AA points?<br>
<br>
Now, if this is asking too much, even dropping the min level on spells between 10 and 20 levels worth would also solve many issues since we are always mana limited.<br>

<br>
Actually fixing casters needs to be something that's done across the board, not for the limited part of the population that can take down the THO, or Rhag' or Arch Liche or whatever. FT1 items (which can't stack with themselves) should be more obtainable for more 'normal' wizards, if they're going to be consider class enhancing/fixing.<br>
<br>
I tend to agree on generic 'wizards can crit on spells allatime' idea, much like warriors can crit. The problem I see with it is that casters aren't as easily directly comparable as melees. Warriors were the baseline everyone else is compared to. I can't think of any easy way to compare casters. If anything, it'd be something like 'mages are DD baseline. Wizards are supposed to be able to do 120% of mages in DD' sort of things, much like 'warriors are baseline. Monks do this much more, rogues situationally do this much more'.<br>
With casters, you can't rely on damage, because of utility spells and what flavor of damage it is (pet, DD, DoT), special effects added to the damage (stunning, interrupting, debuffing), or mode of the damage (bolt, single target, rain, 4 target aoe, pbaoe). The different caster classes each have strong suits and weak ones, and might be the baseline for DoT single target, or something... but drawing the lines for that would be really subjective. By the way, wizards aren't (or shouldn't be) baseline for ANY form of damage. Wizards, from description and design, exceed the baseline across the board (faster damage, better efficiency, efficiency in pbaoe, etc).<br>
