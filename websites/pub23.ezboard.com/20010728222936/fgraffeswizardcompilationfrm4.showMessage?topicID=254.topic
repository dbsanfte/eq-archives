<br>
STFU.  You should be ELATED that your guild <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> needs</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> you.  What can't you understand?  You should feel honored by the fact that you make raids happen by getting everyone to where they need to be.  Enchanters are crack whores, necros are summon corpse whores, and clerics are just rez whores too then.  You should pride yourself that you have this ability that is truly a necessity.  Not every class has one of those.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> a wizard says, &quot;I hate translocating people!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
OK, get a clue here.  YOU ASKED FOR THESE.  You asked for a spell to send somewhere without having to go there yourself.  And now LFG wizards roll they eyes when they get a TL request because they just don't feel like it?  God damn.  If it bothers you that much, say you'll TL for a fee.  Its *not* that big of a deal to med up the 225 mana if your lfg or just auctoning.  This was supposed be a relief to your class and you turned it into a burden.  These spells make wizards MORE VALUABLE to the eq community!!  And you take it for granted.<br>
<br>
It's one thing to complain about tells from newbies who want you to translocate them to fay they're in everfrost and  you're in dragon necropolis....  <br>
<br>
but it's something else to complain about the actual spells.  Verant did something nice to you for once.  They gave you a new ability that made you more desired. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uetheon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Etheon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/9/01 11:31:14 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/erichq2/penguin.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards Stingy with ports / TL</span><hr size=1> I hope you dont play on innoruuk. <p><body vlink="#0000FF" alink="#0000FF">

<br>
   One or two wizards asked for this through 14 class-balance threads, and so far, only *two* suggestions have been implemented. (Rain spells no longer hit pets, and the bane spells, when they could have added something more nicely.)<br>
 <br>
   You are the type of person we are complainign about. No, we don't *want* to translocate you.  It's not our duty to translocate you if we're not busy either, it's a priviledge not a right. If you don't like that we're charging, find someone else who isn't or go bug a druid.  It's not time to lecture wizards because Verant got something wrong.   It's what wizards want to be wanted for,a nd that's not being an uber-taxi.  No one in their right minds started a wizard for this.  Let me clear this up for you, Wizards = damage dealers.  Good, have we got this yet? If not, go away.<br>
<br>
   Here's a guide: If you are a friend, or a guildmate, you will get free translocates and teleports.  If you are on a corpes run or a cleric, you *might* get free translocates, if I don't know you and you're being nice, I expect platinum.  If the attitude in your post shows when you're asking me, you'll find my vengeful streak come out and I'll be doing my best to make sure y ou walk *everywhere*. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umarktodd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MarkTodd</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/01 12:52:43 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards Stingy with ports / TL</span><hr size=1> Anyone else smell troll stench? <p>Merkus Stormcrow (40, High Elf, Mostly Retired Wizard)

My wife and I play side by side on two seperate PCs and accounts. We ALWAYS are together when playing EQ.<br>
<br>
She's a level 39 Barbarian Shaman.<br>
I'm a level 45 Human Wizard.<br>
<br>
In an eligable hunting zone here's our average for tells(per hour):<br>
<br>
Her...2 tells asking if she wants to join a group, 2 drive-by's looking for a SoW.<br>
<br>
Me...5 tells looking for taxi service.<br>
<br>
(Keep in mind this is AVERAGE, some zones are quieter, some are FAR worse.)<br>
<br>
Is there anything slightly annoying about my groupability as a wizard here? No, not to me, I have many close friends and don't do pick-up groups.<br>
<br>
Do I see something wrong with the wizard class groupability as a whole? You bet.<br>
<br>
I can't pretend to speak for other classes, I don't play them.<br>
<br>
Now as to whether I find recieiving tells from strangers looking for a taxi annoying or not? Damn straight I do.<br>
Nothing irks me more than to be involved in a tell conversation with a close friend and have my replies misdirected by some stranger tapping me via /tell for a ride.<br>
<br>
I have NEVER in my 2 years playing time sent a tell to s stranger to request ANY service, buff, rez, SoW, or anything remotely related. Not once.<br>
Reason? Simple...I don't like intruding on what I consider someone else's private space uninvited.<br>
That's right, a /tell is like a phone number. <br>
I don't call strangers at home to bug them for my own selfish gain. And I won't do it in a game either.<br>
(Children don't often understand this concept, although they probably will someday...usually after they have children of thier own. Although some never do quite &quot;get it&quot;.)<br>
<br>
I will quickly give anything possible when asked by a friend in-game, including my life to save them.<br>
But I owe &quot;NOTHING&quot; to inconsiderate strangers invading some else's privacy in order to make thier own game easier.<br>
<br>
If you don't feel this way, that's YOUR right. Wonderful, give it all up however you see fit.<br>
But DON'T get all bent when you send me a tell and receive a polite 'No' or no reply at all.<br>
 And for chrissake, PLEASE don't send me further tells attempting to argue the point or sweeten the deal.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, you only shed a poor light on yourself by coming to a wizard forum with the opinion that this class (as strangers) owes you anything in-game. And offering coin does NOTHING to make tells to strangers any less inconsiderate.<br>
Same holds true for any &quot;wizards&quot; that engage in this same behavior towards other classes.<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
Double-speak and rationalize all you like, it's simply self-centered poor manners.<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
Yes this game is social, but then again...so is Burger King.<br>
Does this mean you want strangers coming to your table and sitting in your lap while they eat, or asking you to go get them another order of fries?<br>
I doubt it.<br>
<br>
Picture yourself sitting with a few friends on a sunny afternoon, fishing at a public park. Now...I come along and interrupt you by whispering in your ear, offering $10 for your fishing pole, and another $10 for you to give me a ride to town in your car so you can buy bait.<br>
I'll bet nearly ALL of you would look at me like someone hit me with an &quot;idiot&quot; stick.<br>
<br>
/ooc, /shout, and /say have a public purpose. <br>
/groupsay, /guildchat, and  ESPECIALLY /tell are NOT public.<br>
<br>
In-game ettiquette? Yes, there is such a thing, same as in the real world.<br>
<br>
Happy Gaming,<br>

<br>
While you are long gone and either banking or logging we are still translocating. Then there is the matter of link dead people or afk people or the ones you are waiting on to get ressed before you can leave.<br>
<br>
How about making 5-6 trips through sirens grotto evacing people and coming back for more and spending a hour or so getting everyone there while you are already fighting mobs? Thus of course securing your place in the last group made because you are the one of the last ones to the raid since you are porting everyone. And 5 mins after you are there woop someone else just logged on and guess who needs a ride? Yes thats right the wizards get to be punished and miss that part of the raid because some dumb non-caster cant get to a port spot on time.<br>
<br>
I have been playing a wizard since beta and never once did I intend on being a &quot;port whore&quot;. I made a wizard simply because almost every other game I have played involving this many classes the wizard in the long run always did the most damage at the higher levels. I dont recall asking for translocate spells.<br>
<br>
When and only when you have played a wizard to level 60 will we even consider your opinion. Frankly I dont know why you would be stupid enough to come post some dumb shit like that on this board. We all know our roles in our guilds without your stupidy. <br>
<br>
I suppose you have never complained about your class either?<br>
<br>
And to sum it up, I am sure it was some dumbshit like yourself on my server who was in east commons selling these same translocate spells we are suppose to use on you.<br>

First you brainless wonders, the first of the TLs aren't until 39.  WC DOES NOT HAVE A TL AT THIS TIME!!!!<br>

Second, Verant decided that Druids required more immediate access to Freeport..<br>

WIZARDS DO NOT GET WC PORTAL UNTIL 39!<br>

So when I say &quot;No, I can't port you to WC&quot;...  Believe it!  If I could, I'd simply say I'm too busy now.  As it stands, when my wife wants to go to FP, we have to make the dangerous run through Nek.<br>

Now this is totally assinine, but completly irrelevant.  The Gods at Verant know all.  There for young wizards are bent over regularly through out their lives.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
<br>
A port costs 300mana (about 1 bubble for me).  Unless you are providing a Clarity, that will take me 3 - 5 minutes to regain.<br>
<br>
Plus 30 secs to get your lazy ass grouped with me.  Often times 5 minutes resending LOCs since you can't be bothered to get yourself to a Spire/Platform.  1 minute to get confirmation as to where you are going, and then 45secs to zone.<br>
<br>
Then I get to wait for your sorry lagging ass zoned in, and hope you don't stiff me.<br>
<br>
I figure a single out of the blue port for a stranger costs me 12 minutes of my time.  Fucking right I expect compensation.<br>
<br>
Not only do I expect you to throw some plat my while (though I'm not a tight as druid who won't port without the minimum fare), but I expect you to speak in something approaching proper english.<br>
<br>
I don't care if I have to shout for a french/english speaking bi-lingual if you seem to be making a genuine effort.<br>
<br>
D00dz get nothing from me but contempt.<br>
<br>
And may the Gods have mercy if you are rude.  I sure as hell will not be.<br>
<br>

<br>
What pisses Wizards off is two fold:<br>
<br>
1:  The VI announcent was worded in a way that said &quot;We have evaluted the class, and you are now the masters of arcane transportation.  He are your new spells, you are balanced&quot;.<br>
<br>
This was quickly restated into a more intellegent statement, but left a bad taste in all our mouths.<br>
<br>
<br>
2:  STUPID SHITS LIKE YOU!<br>
<br>
Our ports are there to serve 2 people.<br>
<br>
Us<br>
<br>
OUR groups....   The ones we KNOW we are going to be hunting with.<br>
<br>
Not 'Our Guilds'....   Who are just as likely to have us port everyone in, set up groups (of which we get in the last one), send us back up to pick a late comer, and hve them fill our slot because XXX class is more valuable than a Wizard.<br>
<br>
Imagine how you would feel.  A little childhood mediphore (sotra, bear with me)..<br>
<br>
Spend an hour of your time, getting ready for a ballgame, picking up friends because you have the biggest car.<br>
<br>
Being the 'last kid picked for the team', and then being <br>
told to drive to a friends house, drive him over, and then sit on the sidelines because 'the teams would be uneven'.<br>
<br>
Why?  Well, you have a big car, it's your job.  You should feel honored that your friends want you around at all.<br>
<br>
But you can't play in the game.  You can't share in the victory or the defeat.  Because you aren't apart of the game, you didn't earn any rewards that may come forth.<br>
<br>
Basically, you're shit out of luck, bacause you have a big car.  What else do they need you for.<br>
<br>

you say its no trouble, and most time i agree if im sitting on my ass in commons i will tl anybody unless they demand it, but i expect payment, now its as if wizards shouldnt be paid cuz we dont have to zone?<br>

i know other classes are bothered by their special talents as well, but i didnt make my wizard to be a port bitz, and thats exactly what verant has made me. personally im gonna move to AO pretty soon so i dont really give a rats ass what verant decides to do with the wizard class, they have dissapointed me enough already<br>

<br>
First, while I don't have to go on the ride with Translocate, it does cost mana and takes time to get you to me, get you in the group, make sure where you are going, cast the spell, and disband the group.  So this isn't a matter of a few key strokes.  In fact, the way some people type and apparently can't think, it can be very challenging to even get them to get to where you are and figure out just what the hell they want.  Now, if I am in the middle of negotiating a trade for that Stick of Smacking Really Hard© in the bazaar in East Commonlands, I don't have time nor inclination to talk to you about a translocate or get your silly behind to my side so I can send you there.  I'm busy.  Respect that a little.<br>
<br>
I'll port people when I can, and I never charge, but don't act as if this is some sort of entitlement for you to get a port.  It's not.  Mana isn't free, we don't have mend and bind wounds to zip us back up full tout sweet.  Don't get surly if someone wants money to cast their spell, that's their right and you can always say no and walk.  People used to do that.  I did until level 20, I never got a port.<br>
<br>
Oh, and if the new translocates go in the game?  You best have a stack of the reagents on you, because no Wizard is gonna buy a bunch just to send other people away. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=254.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=254.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=254.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=254.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=254.topic&start=101&stop=117>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=295.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=294.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=254.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=254.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=254.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=254.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm11">Velium Chill of Al'Kabor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm6">Tome of Ages Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4>Rant Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
