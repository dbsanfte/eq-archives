<br>
Of course they do, you are comparing a rogue/warrior to a wizard in their optimal setting.  Compare them to a wizard in our optimal settings, AoE group or quad soloing.  In AoE groups exps come 2 to 3 times faster than normal groups and everything dies before the rogue or warrior has inflicted 5% of it's total damage.  Quad solo wizard kites and kills all four critters doing 100% damage.  The rogue and warrior served as lunch by the four critters.  Really makes it look like something needs to be done for warrior and rogue damage output doesn't it?  <br>
<br>
What wizards need to do is stop playing the game by the other classes rules.  If you don't know how to quad kite or AoE group, learn.  Once you get a chanter, cleric and tank onboard with AoE, they won't want to ever do normal grouping again.  AoE and quad kiting are the most fun you'll ever have in this game, I promise.  Sitting around with 3 tanks, a chanter and a cleric blows.  So go level, and quit trying to come up with reasons why you suck.  You suck becuase you are lazy and unimaginative, not because VI made you that way.<br>
<br>
The only real problem I see with wizards are Velious mobs and the new gods.  Those uber mobs with more than 32K hp should all be affected by bane spells.  Once VI thinks about it and gives us Dain Bane, God Bane, and fixes the other two to include the other SoV 32k+ mobs we'll be fine.  So get to work VI, now! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urombusmindspire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/01 12:42:13 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://wots-signatures.hypermart.net/rombus/sidepic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This board always crack me up...</span><hr size=1> Couldn't agree more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR>

We have Rune events and medic stations all the times.  What about setting up sessions to teach wizards who do not know about or do not feel comfortable about how to do it just what needs to be done. It could be done in say Q Hills or Commons for the lower levels of Karana for the higher ones.  These places are mostly clear and flat.  Get a couple of Druid/Shammy friends to come along to provide the SOW's and give them pointers on what they are should and should not do..<br>

I thought the same way you did B. I am in a reasonably big guild and have been for a while. I have not had to find pickup groups. I played the PL soloing game to get my levels up to fight the big stuff... It is great you play that way. I see you have an epic and a Kael robe too so would assume you are in the same situation.<br>
<br>
When was the last time you went to sebilis looking for a pickup group? When was the last time you were LFG for over 3 hours? I actually did this because I was tired of quadding raptors or soloing (it is not how the game was designed by the way or wizzys would have been given SOW like druids). I was amazed at the responses I got (or lack thereof) while trying to get in a group.<br>
<br>
That being said, I believe lots of casters have that problem with the exception of chanters. Mages and Necros have the same problem in looking for a group. Unless you can make melee people better, they don't need you. Medding = downtime and we add to that.<br>
<br>
I agree wholeheartedly with your assessment of the banes but honestly, I would rather they lower the resist so that we can hit them with our regular nukes. That means mages can nuke, necros can cast, and druids can nuke too. It also makes hybrids more useful since they can land damage spells. It also solves our mana issue to a degree since with Sunstrike I can almost do as much as with Banes. Get rid of the melee range requirement. It is silly and has no place. If they want to make it a half range or whatever then that would be fine. This would solve many of the velious issues.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is that while you and I might not have these specific problems due to our circumstance, many wizzys do. They should be allowed to voice their concerns just as well as you do without suffering the insults and being told they don't know how to play their class just because they do not have the same guildsupport or playstyle you do. <br>

<br>
Because on my server there's not an abundance of Chanters/Clerics to just pick up and run and do an AoE group somewhere. <br>
<br>
They already have groups, they are already getting exp, and lewt...From the minute a chanter/cleric logs on they have about 2 to 4 tells for groups. (heh usually one from me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
So how do you combat the lack of resources to do an AoE group? <br>
<br>
Ok so you go Quad kite.. good idea.<br>
<br>
Doh! Every zone I can quad kite in is overloaded with the ever amazing and all powerful Dr00ds!!<br>
<br>
Now what?<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to bash/flame you Beryl, but you come off as if as soon as you log on you get 5 tells begging you for an AoE group OR you just randomly pick from the hundreds of LFG chanters and clerics to start a group.<br>
<br>
It's not like that on most servers...<br>
<br>
So that is why you see the post's and messages you do. Do you really think Wizards don't try to do what you suggest?? Its not that we've never thought of that or tried it... its because when all else fails, we have to resort to /LFG ON and hoping for a pick-up group. AND THATS WHEN we experience how pathetic our use is to a group that has a Rogue/Warrior/Monk in it.<br>
<br>
Does that make sense?<br>
<br>
If it's as easy as you say... please tell us how <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

They have all of 5 wizards, under their requirements, they need wizards and shamans 52+, clerics and enchanters 54+ and everyone else to be 56+.  Reason being, wizards are the most uncommon class on the server.  Yes there are wizards, but many of them stop early on or around 52.  <br>
<br>
AoE grouping is almost impossible for me to do since I am the only high lvl wizard in my guild and one of 3 in our alliance.  Pickup wizard AoE groups are dangerous since you need to work as a team and finding an enchanter willing to risk it for pickup is almost impossible.  Would I do AoE grouping? sure I would, it sounds like fun.  Can I do it?  Not in the forseeable future.<br>

As far as learning how to quad goes, it's not hard to practice.  If you have BoF and CoF head out to SK and practice kiting aviaks.  Leave the egrets alone they run faster than the others.  Fire up your boots or get sow, get three or four to chase you, make a wide circle to group them up, run straight out from them ranging with cof or flux staff, when you get out of range, turn and cast cof, rinse repeat until they all dead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucolossusa.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Colossusa</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/01 1:52:23 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://gucomics.everlore.com/coolstuff/sigpic_05.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Plat Holes?</span><hr size=1> Myztic -  <br>

For those of you who say soloing is boring, I ask you this: Do you really believe sitting in the SAME room for hours on end pulling the SAME mobs over and over again waiting for some rare spawn to pop is really that entertaining? If you answer yes, I'd seek professional help <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><P align=center>

If I am in a group even camping the same spot, I have 5 people to chat with and laugh with and get to know. If I am soloing and not in a guild or they are not on then I get to chat with....the raptors? Many people like to group and chat because that is the appeal of Everquest. Otherwise there are many first person games that could serve your interest.<br>
<br>
No professional help needed thank you.<br>

I have a 56 cleric I log on sometimes and I laugh at how many tells I get, not for resses but for groups. I was in FV the other day not anon and got a tell from someone in sebilis to come and group and they would even pick me up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I don't know many enchanters that have trouble grouping.<br>

On Lanys there's hardly a moment that goes by that when I do a /who all 50 60 ENC LFG or (Cleric) that I get more then one return.<br>
<br>
I don't disagree with you at all Samadhi, about quad kitting or being able to move around at will, etc. <br>
<br>
But the fact remains that MOST of the time the circumstances are AGAINST the Wizard, no chanters, no clerics, no open area to q-kit in, or all of them full of druids, or whatever. <br>
<br>
When your not needed in a group to begin with, the odds are stacked against you. <br>
<br>
I was making a point that it is not as easy as Beryl said it was from her message... <p><img src="http://home.kc.rr.com/darkwhispers/images/nizz_sig.jpg" width="360" height="210" border="0"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samadhi BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/01 2:11:44 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This board always crack me up...</span><hr size=1> ((If I am in a group even camping the same spot, I have 5 people to chat with and laugh with and get to know.

<br>
People in the zone? Friends? Guildmates in the RARE chance you're in a guild? I usually have more people to talk to soloing than grouped. Sitting in the same spot for hours on end loses it's appeal VERY fast, no matter how many people you have to talk to. Soloing you aren't restricted to the same 6 foot by 6 foot space, you can move around if you want. I don't know about you, but I didn't sign on this game to prepare myself for a life in a cubicle, thank you very much. If you like grouping that's fine, people shouldn't act like it's the best thing in the game and you'll wither and die without it. <p><P align=center>

But is that Verant's fault?  Is it something verant needs to fix that there aren't enough enchanters on server X? At some point, players have to take responsibility for their situation.  We can't blame verant for everything.  Hell, there's not enough bards on my server but I don't see that as Verant's fault.<br>
<br>
Nizzdal, keep looking for other spots.  I play on a very busy server and I was able find spots that weren't overrun with druids.<br>
<br>
Yaldiin, use two wizards and a mage for aoe.  It works fine.  If you talk to those other wizards you might be surprised to find that they want to do aoe just as much as you do.<br>
<br>
As a rule of thumb, I can tell you which wizards are happy and which are not simply by what they do with their time.  If you aren't using some form of aoe on a fairly regular basis, the chances are good you hate being a wizard.  Doing single target xp groups is a death sentence for wizard morale. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uberylshadowhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Beryl Shadowhawk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/01 2:30:14 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.unlv.edu/faculty/engstrom/images/bcard.jpg WIDTH=149 HEIGHT=175></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This board always crack me up...</span><hr size=1> Oops lots of replies while I was explaining quad, let me do the same for AoE.  Nobody begs you for AoE groups, you make them yourself at the start.  It takes work to get folks to try it.  But once you get them hooked it's all they will want to do.  Half the group is wizzies, so that part isn't too hard.  Seems wizzies always looking for a group or are you all lying in all these posts?  Now you have three wizzies and need three more, one tank(doesn't matter, they are just pulling), one cleric, one chanter.  Between the three wizzies they should be able to find the other three without much trouble and if they are miles away, go get them.  Explain to them how it works, it's all timing, AoE nuke, AoE stun, rinse, repeat.  Best mobs to use this on are melee types, so AoE in areas that have a lot of melee.  Do your first pulls near a zoneline until you get the timing down.  Soon as you have it figured out (it's not hard) you can go anywhere.  When the tank, cleric and chanter see the exps roll in, you won't have to look very hard next time you want to group.  Actually have had three AoE groups working in the basement of Karnor's before, killing the entire basement spawn in 30 secs.  Was the best time.<br>
<br>
Now here's a news flash for Fant since she asked:  I DON'T WANT A NORMAL GROUP IN SEB OR ANYWHERE ELSE, EVER!  Did you not read my first post?  Stop playing the game by VI's rules and get smart.  I wouldn't look for a group in seb for 3 minutes let alone 3 hours.  I'd look in seb to make an AoE group for about 30 secs.  If no wizzies hanging out, I'm off to quad kite.  <br>
<br>
Let's simplify this a bit so everyone's not lost in the dialogue.  You can stand around for three hours and hope to get into another boring group in seb who will be wishing they got a druid instead of you the whole time.  Or you could just spend an hour figuring out how to quad kite and having a blast making 2 to three times the exps as the group.  Or you could spend the time getting a few other lonely wizzies together and some of their friends and go learn how to do AoE and forever change how you look at your class.  So how do you want to spend your 3 hours? <br>
