Recently I have experimented a bit, and as far as I can measure it, every single mob in SF runs at the same speed.<br><br>....<br><br>here we go... dug up my old post:<br><br>Skyfire Mountains. Suicidal drop-zone. Hellish landscape. Venomous beats in every direction. Creatures that blast fire... poison... nullify magic...<br><br>Very little competition for mobs.<br><br>And... surprisingly... good quadding, if you have the skills. I tried quadding there after reading about it on the aoe kiting forum. It worked out really well.<br><br>The zone actually has a nice combination of dense and dry spots. So with a little exploration you can find a nice quiet spot to pull to, with a large reservoir of mobs to draw from nearby. Now all you have to do is avoid grisley death!<br><br>Grisley Death comes in the form of the chromadrac population with their painful dot/dispell combo. But be not afraid. They have short range and are in fact good quad targets when you get used to them. They won't dispell you unless you really screw up and get into melee range - but there's a fair chance you might catch a dot.<br><br>With my shielding up I have about 1200 hp. The dot ignores manaskin and goes straight to hp, but it only does about 400 hp damage, so I can eat two dots and live. Which means I can afford to eat one dot and continue quadding in relative safety. Usually if I eat a dot, I only eat one. I've only had to abort a chroma quad once in my memory.<br><br>The drakes are also casters, but they only cast piddly DD, and again at short range. They move at the same speed as the chromas, so you can pack them and quad them easily. Speaking of which, that's a rule of thumb in this zone: if it has wings and flies, it's in the 'slow' group of quad combinations. Everything else is in the 'fast' group - including wyverns, sperm (devourers) and wurms.<br><br>Let me take a minute to talk about wurms. Contrary to all advice I've heard, wurms are good quad meat - they're just tricky. Wurms and wyverns are quaddable at 54. Period. Mature wurms and wyverns are a very hard quad if you lack KEI, but I have done it at 55.<br><br>People say the problem with wurms is their reach. But that's not really the problem directly; even with their long reach you have plenty of space to snare them and nuke if you hit from max range. The problem is they have a very short chase radius. So if you get a resist or a miss (and it is hard to pack these guys) then you can't keep running and snare the rest because the pack will separate and now you're in trouble. Now you have 4 very large, angry creatures running in different directions, and you are faced with a perplexing geometric problem; you have to position yourself in the midst of the fleeing crowd to regain aggro, and the long reach of the wurms means there is zero margin of safety in any direction.<br><br>There is a simple solution to this. If I am quadding wurms and I fudge the snare, I run laps, wait the snare out and try again. Sure it costs 2 minutes, but it works. Once the mobs are snared, I resnare often - usually twice to four times per quad. With mobs this hard to wrangle, you can't afford to let the snare drop. But let me assure you, seeing 4 mature wurms hit the dust together is very rewarding, both in terms of pride, xp(very nice!), and most importantly, the fact that it's 4 less wurms to get in the way of the 'easy' meat; devourers and wyverns.<br><br>Devourers are the best meat in this zone, imo. Sure they're in the 'fast' group, but they don't cast and they have short reach. And they have few hp. If you can get a pack of wyverns and devourers, you're on easy street. If you get more than 4, no worries. I no longer even snare these mobs; they can't catch me in the time it takes to cast. No snare = no pack management hassles. Very nice. You just need a nice clear stretch to run them on.<br><br>All things considered, Skyfire is more challenging and dangerous than CS, and the mobs have more hp. It probably doesn't have as much raw quadability as CS. But if when you account for the time wasted waiting for spawns in CS due to overcrowding, well... Skyfire is my new home.<br><br>further notes:<br>1) Skyfire won't make you cash rich like CS, but it drops a ton of spells.<br><br>2) Really do bring KEI if you intend to tackle the 'tough' mobs; mature wyverns/chromas/wurms fall into this category, as well as skyfire drakes. &quot;Old&quot; wurms are even meaner than &quot;mature&quot; but I've yet to try one in a quad. And never leave home without your focus items - particularly the earring for mana conservation. You'll often spend a full tank to quad here, and every bit helps.<br><br>3) You will need bat wings. Trust me. You will also need jboots/runspeed. Chroma dispell is usually avoidable, but if you get caught... you need something instant and refreshable. They don't take American Express. I'm considering buying some sow potions as well, to push my advantages, but jboots/runspeed is a necessary backup.<br><br>4) I use Bonds of Force. Atol's is more expensive to cast. I also use the original flavor 'root'. But use whatever works best for ya of course.<br><br>5) one of the hardest things about quadding in skyfire is simply the way the mobs are animated. Chromas and drakes fly, and it is very hard to judge range on a creature which isn't connected to the ground -- especially on hilly terrain. Of course one uses the flux staff to judge distance, but with no other frame of reference, it's kind of like flying on instruments only. It takes some getting used to. <br><br><br>......<br><br>a while after I posted this, the allure of skyfire slackened a bit for me. I went back and managed to catch CS when it was empty once, and the xp was indeed better - a quad of blue wyverns takes me one bub of mana at 55. With KEI, the only time I med is while I'm looting... but... realistically... most times if I try to hunt in CS I spend 10-15 minutes just accumulating a quad of solid blues. The place is an absolute disaster nowadays... at least on Vaz... it only takes about 3 players to wipe out the wyvern population of the entire board. And there are usually 12.<br><br>So. Skyfire may not be as good, but it's still better =)  and it's a helluva lot more exciting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=setch>Setch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/15/02 11:01:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=480.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> one last tip</span><hr size=1> One other tip regarding the wurms - I've gotten a bit more experience since I wrote the guide.<br><br>I said the best thing to do if you break a quad is run the snare out. Well. This is true... Sometimes.<br><br>But I have found that if there is only one creature unsnared, I can usually take one orbit around, head back past the pack, and gain enough of a lead on my chaser to root him, without losing my wurms. At that point, of course, you just snare the offending mob and then tap him with a draught to break his root.<br><br>But if I have more than one mob unsnared, or the pack includes chromas, then I generally still just run laps. It isn't too fancy but it works.<br><br>Btw - If you're wondering why I didn't tell you about my specific quadding grounds, it's because I'm evil.

I dont have a staggering mana pool, 3600 without buffs, aprox 4k with buffs.  I am going to try and get all the way through 59 in SF, ill report back on 59 XP later.<br><br>A few observations about quading in SF.<br><br>First, the round up:<br>Pulling and round up is the most difficult part of hunting here, one has to be selective about the choice of targets.  My personal favorite is the Wyverns and the Devourers.<br>The ideal quad for me would be 3 mature wyverns and one elder wyvern, I always try to get one Elder per quad, after the other 3 drop I have just enough mana to make the elder go into run mode and then I can safely harvest to finish it.  I wish I had enough mana to quad elders, but it would take about 15 casts of PoF, that would take an amazing mana pool &amp; the best buffs, I have duo-quaded elders with another wiz.<br><br>Where to Quad &amp; Med:<br>I have found a few nice spots to quad, one is along the shores of the big lava lake, there are very few mobs that path through the lake.  Another good spot is along the rim of the volcano that is the entrance of VP, agene there is very limited pathing here, BTW one can safely med sitting on top of the VP entrance near where it connects to the volcano, there is NO pathing here, I go AFK here all he time and have never been bothered.<br><br>One last though regarding the Z-axis and range of spells<br>We all know the pain of having variations in elevation eat up our spell range, this can be very frustrating when you can see clearly that the mob is in range but keep getting the out of range message.  Use the Z-axis to you advantage and turn the tables on the mobs.<br>In order to use the Z-axis to full advantage one must set up the proper conditions.<br>This trick works very well in SF due to the rocky terrain, this works best when you are trying to snare the quad after the round up (I never snare till I get all 4 mobs grouped) <br>The setup is like this, you must start casting when you and the mobs are on the same level, thus negating the effect of the Z-axis before the cast. Here is the trick, set it up so that there is something like a drop off or rocks between you and the mobs(like a lava river, or some form of cliff.  So that when you start the cast the mobs are within range and no Z-axis effects, when you stop to cash the mobs are in range, but during the cast the mobs drop off or raise elevation (which would normally bring them out of range due to Z-axis deferential), but sense the spell is already casting, even though technically they have moved out of range the spell will still land. In this manner one can increase the casting range of any spell, and reduce the chance of getting hit while quad unsnared fast moving mobs. This works very with a little practice and one can even quad without snare if done right<br><br>Hope this helps<br>Have fun quading in SF<br>I have found a new home<br><br>Nusun Starweaver<br>59 Wizard of Relavare<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=setch>Setch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/30/02 8:07:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=480.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quading in SF</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> SF is a XP gold mine, shhhuuussss, dot tell the druids.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I concur.

So we can afford a few visitors... just don't go shouting it from the hilltops =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umyztic.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MyztiC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/2/02 8:14:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=480.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Quading in SF</span><hr size=1> At 56 I'm quadding nearby wiz platform on South wall and I always have KEI.<br><br>Usual kites have regular wyverns, skyash drakes and sperms. Occasionally I also take a mature wyvern or skycinder drake, but I try to avoid those. Reason for this is simple, 75% of lowbie mobs are dark blue, and only takes about 40% mana to do to quad. With the amount of available mobs, the breaks are short. Cinder and mature kites take about 70% mana, so the med up time is longer.<br><br>I tried the North wall behind VP entrance, it is nice, smooth area. But I had hard time finding low level mobs to kite. Elder wyverns are fun, but takes about 120% mana to finish a kite of four of them. And med-kiting is not my idea of fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Skyfire is fun. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=73401">-myz</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaspxidar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aspxidar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/5/02 3:00:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=480.topic&index=13>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Worst part about Quadding in SF?</span><hr size=1> No place to Fish <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://www.mistakenid.org/images/aspsig.jpg"><br /><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=164977" target="new">Asp's Gear</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=265860" target="new">Qatzen's Gear</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucarneab.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Carne AB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/6/02 1:53:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=480.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Worst part about Quadding in SF?</span><hr size=1> My mana pool is really small and it seems that these have quite a few hps for their lvl.
