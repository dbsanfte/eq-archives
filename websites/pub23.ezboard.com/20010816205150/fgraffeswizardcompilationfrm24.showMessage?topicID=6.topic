<br>
I wasn't sure it would help, but I'd been down to the goblins and I definitely wouldn't have survived if I'd got close so I wondered if wolf-form would help. It did.<br>
<br>
I'm guessing that the Lake Rathetear rod will be achievable with Enduring Breath and Wolf-Form. The Everfrost one shouldn't be too much of a struggle for me as I've heard of lower level Wizards handling the skeletons (or rooting them and gating out after grabbing the rod). Might Wolf-Form also help here?<br>
<br>
The only rod I'm likely to have major trouble with (apart from getting the druidly assistance) is the LGuk one. I'm guessing Wolf-Form isn't allowed indoors...? Invis vs Undead might be useful for me from a handy nearby caster (it is targettable isn't it?) Can you have both normal Invis and Invis vs Undead on at the same time? I hear the Vampire Bats aren't undead so see you and aggro, breaking IvU. Is &quot;the hand&quot; spawn camped very often? It would be nice to just stroll in there, grab the rod and gate out...<br>

<br>
Lake Rathe requires Enduring Breath.<br>
<br>
Everfrost might require Enduring Breath, depends on your swimming skill (100+ would cut it close).  You also have to watch out for Miragul (sp?).  He has a nasty habit of roaming around down there and killing anyone he sees.<br>
<br>
You cannot have invis and invis vs undead on at the same time.  You'll have to wait for some group to clear the hand room, then swim up and grab the rod. <p><BR><BR>

<br>
I know that the ones down at the bottom in Oasis see invis (they would have ripped my head off if I had moved close enough) but didn't con the ones up top... I just swam off and came back once I had wolf form.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming that whatever you say about the goblins applies to Lake Rathe too...<br>
<br>
And as for the hand room and &quot;just swim up&quot;... I guess I ought to get some better maps as I didn't even know there was any water near to that room. It looks a bit of a maze and I'm sure I'm likely to die very easily (possibly multiple times) trying to get this rod. I suspect I might bank everything before I try, although that's going to mean clearing out my bank a bit...<br>

<br>
Yep.  My own experience has shown that the ones that see invis are usually on the lower level of the tower.  The ones on top typically don't see invis (although, rarely there's one that does).  Just grabbing the rod shouldn't agro the lower level.  And yes, this applies to Lake Rathe as well.<br>
<br>
The hand room is definately unique.  The floor is a normal room, but there's a pool of water suspended in mid-air.  You have to jump up into it and swim to the top.  At the top is a ledge.  That's where the hand, and one undead frog spawn.  The hand is alive, and invis works.  The frog is undead, and invis to undead works.  However, you can't have them both up, so you have to clear at least one of them out first.  The rod is on that ledge too.<br>

This mostly coincides with my experience. I got lucky in Oasis, all conned indifferent, weren't buffed with see invis so in I went and picked it up no problems, however I know a friend that died there as they were buffed with see invis.<br>
<br>
Lake Rathe was an experience for me. I was lvl 31 at the time I did most of the rods. (I didnt know about the Wolf Form trick) I swam down, and there was the named NPC's there, Deep. 1 of the goblins was buffed with see invis, the rest were indifferent. At this point I said screw it, I could see the rod and just wanted to be done with the quest. Swam in, picked it up and started swimming away when goblin started scratching me. Next I know I got nuked real hard, and the death message was something about me being slain by wrath. Im not sure if it was another NPC or this is just the message u get from a spell. Pity I didnt have logging turned on at the time. Fortunately my corpse fell at the bottom of the tower and not on top of it. Came back, dragged corpse looted and gated.<br>

In everfrost I hade Enduring breath and a druid with me, but the skellies were very green to me at 24, we dropped them and gated out.<br>
<br>
Lower Guk Is basicly done 1 of 3 ways:<br>
1) Get a group and take the Bedroom, kill at Vamp bats, ITU and run to the hand room. Then fight the hand and _2_ ghoulies. <br>
<br>
2) Go to Lower Guk when it is heavilty camped and take advantace of the fact that everyone is waiting for stuff to spawn. Make sure the bedroom cleans out the Vamp bats, ITU to the hand room and wait for that group ti be in a fight. Grab the wand and gate.<br>
<br>
3) *The way I did it* Take a swig of Tequila in RL, Go to Lower Guk, wait till the bedroom cleans out thebats, ITU to the hand room. SWIM UP THE OPPOSITE WALL TO THE LEDGE AND FIND THE ROD VISUALLY. Know where you are going, I was not bothered when I was pasted against the wall opposite the ledge where the hand and his buddies are. When you have your mark, swim up the ledge side, jump onto the ledge and grab the wand. Put in inventory (have the screen up) and GET BACK TO THE WATER. Die, and repeat process except loot and gate. The dead body will sink to the floor below. <p>Ennya Orcsbane<BR>

As much as I think it's dumb for mobs to SOMETIMES see invis, this is the case here.  It's usually just the easy way out for some ppl because they get conflicting reports from others.  For me the Rathe ones didn't and the Oasis ones did.  But then again, I didn't see any shamans in Rathe and I did in Oasis.  Maybe it's like Perma with the casters seeing invis.  Just have someone pull the tower in Oasis (not too hard to do, since ppl do it on accident most of the time anyways while coming from the isle tower), and when in Rathe, con, con, con.  If the rathies see invis, either wait for a repop, or wait untill someone camps them, which i've heard happens now, since there's an epic quest item dropped down there.<br>

<br>
<br>
Not true. I'm convinced that whether they see invis is  random, at least in Lake Rathetear, perhaps Oasis as well. The Goblins didn't see me invisible in Oasis but I died in Rathe because 1 of the three at the top of the tower was scowling and blue while invis. I decided to just go for it and take my chances hoping to MAYBE get a Gate off in time. No dice, but I did pick up the rod and got some help dragging the corpse to shore. <br>
<br>
Just a warning. You might get a set of Goblins none of whom see invis and you might not. <br>
