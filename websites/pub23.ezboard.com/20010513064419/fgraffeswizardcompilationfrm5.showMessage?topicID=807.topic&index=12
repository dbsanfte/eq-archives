Which NPC it is, and the faction.<br>
  It seems pretty clear to me that the &quot;first&quot; Arantir is a combination of all the Shaman Merchant's quests, but with some different keywords (including &quot;hail&quot;).  This is probably for two purposes.  Clearness (since everything is supposed to go to &quot;Arantir&quot; but technicly the shaman chick IS Arantir), and faction.  The shaman vendor is based on the shaman guild faction, and thus every response/quest she gives is based entirely on that faction as well.  This is why a lot of people can't hand the ring/note in to her, but some can.<br>
   Unless they have done a radical new change in NPC code specificly for this quest, 1 npc can only give 2 responses to &quot;hail&quot; (or any single keyword).  One for insufficient faction, and one for sufficient.  It's possible that everyone is insufficient, and the bad faction message is actually the ring quest, but since you can gain truespirit a few places, this would be a bad idea (once you got high enough faction Arantir would suddenly ask for the 3 staves upon being hailed).<br>
  More likely is that the note (resulting from the bag which results from the skin) spawns an identically named NPC in the same spot, which is actually different.  You can see this behavior several places, most notable with Zordak Ragefire at the end of the cleric epic.  He's a level 60 (i believe?) merchant until you hand him the trigger item, then he instantly repops as level 55 and agro, he still has the same name and look though. (after you kill this repop a dragon pops, but that's beside the point).<br>
  Note that if this &quot;new&quot; arantir were the same as the old, and handing the note did &quot;change&quot; the message he gave you (or being the first to hail him) - he wouldn't just not talk to you if you didn't hand in the note.  Instead he would give you the ring quest he normally does when you hail him.<br>
  What about the other fellow though?  The one that said someone else hailed him first.  I'd imagine he didn't have sufficient faction.  Maybe he skipped parts of the quest, maybe he killed a key npc, maybe he did a thousand things, but recall that he never finished the quest himself.  The GM reimbursed him not with the pieces to turn in again, but with the final item.  Had he been reimbursed with all the pieces, Arantir would still have failed to talk to him.  I'd go so far as to wager that someone else had the cazic skin, bag, and then note, and he was trying a quest swap (hush hush, no one at verant has said this is an exploit, but if you bring it up too much they might decide to speak.. verant never speaks for players, they're either silent, or against).<br>
  So the point of this?  Is this just a wild goose chase, or can you use any of the information here?  Of course you can!  I'd suggest that should you aquire the skin, you hang onto those very nice mid-quest staves until several of your friends have all three staves as well (note that I said friends, as in people that wont try to screw you over :P).  Then get those poor saps to bump their truespirit faction to high hell.  I believe the only &quot;open faction gain&quot; portion of our quest is giving 1000 pp to camin.  That can be a bit expensive, but maybe you have some friends that ran the note loop back before the whole quest was shut off to fix these faction holes.  In any event, once they have high faction (don't worry about your own, you're doing this straight through and should be reimbursed if it fails) go turn in your note.  Make sure you hail him first, and turn in your staves.  Once you're done, have the others hail him and see if they get the &quot;give me your staves&quot; message as well.  If it works, your friends will be happy, if it doesn't, no one has lost anything.<br>
  You may also want to Con arantir (in his various incarnations) before and after handing in items.  If the note takes you from apprehensive to warmly, your friends would probably need warmly to procede as well.<br>

Just seems that verant knew about this as a potential problem with the shaman quest working like that, and I was figuring that with the quest being offline for weeks, that they wouldnt have left that loophole in there.  I'll continue to mull over the issue, and see if I can think of some problem, but... looks like Im stuck waiting for a skin agani.  *sighs*  I was sooo hoping I wouldnt have to.<br>

However, if one skin can be used to complete multiple staff turn ins, this would justify the previous claim of 2-4 weeks time.  In this instance, under perfect conditions, a skin would be used just before another was dropped, and all wizards with the staves at that time would be able to do the turn in.  This would reduce the limiting factor to the VS drop, which appears to be about 1 drop in 2-4 weeks since the patch.  The mistletoe powder drops insanely commonly.  It looks like about a 50% drop rate (I could just be lucky, but I never have been before).  The phinigel staff, even if pretty rare is still more common than the VS staff based solely on spawn time.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Granted, people aren't a trusting bunch, and until it's posted with a log somewhere that this method works, people will be wary that other wizards will steal their arantir turn-in.  Still, you should trust the members of your guild at least, and it should require only 1 skin per guild (provided you get the skin last, or save it til the end).  However... the wizards without the skin will definately need to pump their faction up.  I think there's a thread somewhere on here about doing that.  If all else fails you can always pay 1000 pp per loop and give potions to camin (or just give 1000pp stacks to camin if that gives faction).  So there's your uber guild part - go sell a orc hatchet for 200,000 pp (if a website says it, it must be true!) and you should be all set!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It would be nicer to get some first hand info about the turn in (does arantir despawn after you turn in the first 3 staves?  When you hail him, do you get a faction change like the efreeti in sol temple? What kind of con is arantir before and after the note hand in if you do the quest as it's supposed to be done?), but that doesn't seem to be happening.  Perhaps someone will read this and check it out - and possibly save their friends a few months camp time in the PoF :P<br>
