I saw a group of wyverns at the spire near the rings.  I see a cleric and a SK sitting nearby.  Thinking they are medding for single pulls I assume its ok for me to kill the 4 currently at the spire. <br><br>Afterward I then get a tell from the cleric that they are camping the wyverns at the spires.  I am told not to steal their wyverns.<br><br>I have been soloing in CS for a long time and I have never seen someone claim a camp on wyverns in CS.  There is better exp and loot for a highlevel cleric and a SK in many other zones.   I told the cleric this.  She did not like that answer and told me that such camps are standard practice anywhere.  Confused as I am I mention that if this were true then 3-4 druids could claim a camp in the entire CS zone.  She thought even less of this answer but said that I could do single pulls from the spire if I wanted. <br><br>What do you guys think?  I just decided to leave and do something else.  I'd rather not be on the blacklist of a high level cleric.  Maybe I convinced her to get exp elsewhere because I havent seen her there since.<br><br>Lathrim <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulathrim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lathrim</A> at: 1/21/02 1:02:17 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ughode.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ghode</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/21/02 12:47:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=282.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Camping in CS?</span><hr size=1> Heh i've had the same arguement with a shamen who claimed the 2 Wyverns bear the tower as her camp.

Not a day goes by that some n00b who could never have made it to CS pre-Luclin has just discovered the place and is offended that 5 people in the zone means there is little to kill. I've taken the hard line with them, I advise them there are no camps in CS thank you very much and there hasn't been for the many levels I've killed wyverns, drakes and otters. They also need reminted that its considered extremely bad manners to tag that wyvern that is chasing me, as that could be considered KSing.

That's different. I'm happy to share and make it work. But I paid my dues running thru Kael hoping Invis wouldn't drop, with sweaty palms and all, to get my WL key right before making a death defying run through Skysrhine (again hoping invis wouldn't drop). But these mid 40 babies who pop in LFG (/boggle) can just leave my zone for all I care. I can make VI's &quot;play nice rules&quot; work to my favor in this one.

So i just pull it and kite it underwater a few times and explain to them that the last patch extended the spawn time to 30 minutes.

I turned around and one spiroc was walking up. I ran back and sure enough a group of three were killing my spirocs. So I memmed IC real quick and KS'ed all three back.

I have always been very happy with the CS zone as a place to go to get some peace and some good solo exp.  Since the release of Luclin and the very BAD decision of verant to remove the need of the tooth to port there it is almost impossible to do, especially at peak times.  CS is and has always been a free for all zone.  There are no camps; at least not when it comes to the Wyvernn.  Furthermore, it is actually very dangerous to others for KOS ppl and ppl that just dont know about the zone to be running around there.  I had some idiot pull a Siren on to the beach the other day.  I suppose that person must have died.. Next thing I know a Siren is beating on me.  Charmed me once but i just barely managed to get away.  <br><br>Long story short Verant has managed to ruin an excellent zone that ppl more or less had to earn the right to get to before.
