<br>
This would have the effect of making pets more viable in that a root or snare wouldn't make them a joke.<br>
<br>
In additon the pet should be subject to the same degree of dmg reduction currently suffered by melees when hitting players effected by...<br>
<br>
The Speed of the player being hit.<br>
<br>
The difference in speeds between the pet and the player.<br>
<br>
In other words a pet with velocity (160% base speed) would have no trouble hitting an ensnared (44% base speed) player but that same pet wouldn't be able to do much dmg if both were moving at 160%.<br>
<br>
In addition the pet should get a free full dmg round when the player and the pet cross paths.<br>
<br>
This would have the effect of offsetting partially the gain in power provided by an essentially unrootable unsnarable pet.<br>
<br>
This would also nullify the extremelely lame strategy in which a mage or other pet user would run around while the pet melees the player.  The player is essentially helpless as they will not be able to hit the caster.<br>
<br>
Lets look at the implications...<br>
<br>
Pet vs caster.  Overall the pet is much stronger even with the dmg reduction because it can't simply be taken out of play with a few spells.<br>
<br>
Pet vs hybrid. The pet is stronger here I think because the dmg lost here to reduced dmg is less than the dmg gained from having a pet that can't be taken out of play so simply.  Any imbalance that arises can be fixed by tinkering with the melee dmg reduction/increase tables and the spell dmg reduction/increase tables.<br>
<br>
Pet vs melee.  The pet is weaker in this case due to the removal of the lamer strategy mentioned above however figuring the role of the pet in the overall fight is pretty simple here.<br>
<br>
The melees dmg is a dot that increases or decreases based on if the caster is standing still or moving and depending on how well the caster evades the melee.<br>
<br>
The pets dmg is a dot of the same type.<br>
<br>
Figuring if the dot is effective enough is simply a matter of saying that given the amount of time a caster must stand still to do a given amount of dmg will the pet do enough dmg to potentially kill the melee if the caster pvps as good or better than the melee.<br>
<br>
If the dot isn't effective enough any imbalance can be adressed by tinkering with the melee dmg reduction/increase tables and the spell dmg reduction/increase tables.  Either allowing the caster to do more dmg and kill faster or live longer.<br>
<br>
If more pet dmg is desired instead it seems possible to subject the pet to a variable dmg reduction based on who its attacking in the same manner as the melee to get the right amount of dmg.<br>

On blue servers you use your gear to level quicker and show off and thus the suggestions outlined wouldn't be apropriate but pvp is of primary importance on red servers.<br>
<br>
On red servers highly twinked players which are now very common make a mockery of pvp with those without that lvl of twinkage.<br>
<br>
The most important items balance wise for pvp are weapons, haste items, and regen items.<br>
<br>
Of secondary importance are the resists which were adressed in another suggestion which was to put a lvl based cap on all resists regardless of what gear you wear.<br>
<br>
We can actually go a bit further and add a hp cap too based on lvl and class.<br>
<br>
These changes are not designed to prevent players on red servers from aiding their alt chars to a reasonable extent or from having top of the line gear FOR THEIR LVL.<br>
<br>
In other words a lvl 20 sk with 800 hp 70 to all resists, with neither haste nor regen wielding a centi war spear (20 30 2hander) might be considered within reasonable limits.<br>
<br>
However a 20 sk with a tantors tusk (50 60 weapon from ww) 1200 hp 150 to all resists wearing a fungi tunic and a COF would be considered totally unbalanced. <br>
<br>
Thus the weapon, the cloak and the tunic would be restricted to a higher lvl.<br>
<br>
Thus hp would be capped and he wouldn't be able to get above say 800 regardless of what he put on.<br>
<br>
Thus his resists wouldn't go over say 70 no matter what he wore.<br>
<br>
Thus the well off high lvl player would be forced to equip his char in a manner more fitting for his lvl and compete on a more lvl playing field. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=seven>Seven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/28/02 9:25:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> re</span><hr size=1> thus<br>

<br>
In other words I only need to get 5600 hp to survive a MB from a wizard with mostly old world plane gear...<br>
<br>
Very comforting I only need aegeo, around 100 more stamina, 12 aa to burn on combat dur and full VT gear so I can get 125 hp per slot yay.<br>
<br>
God help me if he/she crits though.<br>
<br>
It is unbalanced because a MB wiz with full manna CAN kill 99% of players buffed or unbuffed by pushing a hotkey for gods sake.<br>
<br>
Real pvp design provides skill sets and classes that are BALANCED ENOUGH not perfectly balanced.  In other words there is a food chain but everyone has a chance.<br>
<br>
Good pvp is diverse and situationally unbalanced.  In other words  different situations and circumstances provide different advantages and disadvantages for different classes.  Skilled play should be required both to make use of advantages and to mitigate disadvantages.  The sum of these advantages and disadvantages should be such that pvp is challenging for all classes but neither impossible nor ridiculously easy no matter the match up.  <br>
<br>
I propose that MB makes pvp with every other class a joke when its in use.<br>
<br>
In general the more powerful the skill the more it should be balanced by limitiations as to which situations it can be used in, disadvantages, skill required to execute properly, increasingly effective countermeasures available to oponents.<br>
<br>
I propose that MBs current time limitiation is a joke, that it is usable in all situations, that no skill is required to use it, that no effective countermeasures exist for most classes, and that the disadvantage of using all manna is insignifigant when the battle is allready won and the loot taken.  Especially when the wiz can simply insta gate with a bit more aa.<br>
<br>
In general all pvp strategies should be to a degree situational and that countermeasures for any strategy should always exist.  The result of this kind of design is an interesting and changable pvp environment as its benificial for both parties to use a variety of strategies and counter strategies.<br>
<br>
When one strategy is overwelmingly powerful or useful above all others pvp becomes a boring and simple minded excercise in which both parties pick the &quot;obvious&quot; strategy and the outcome is just a math problem based on gear lvl class.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mannaburn fits that description.<br>
<br>
When one pvp strategy is overwelmingly powerful and lacks counters pvp for the user becomes ridiculously easy, lacking in challenge, and uninteresting, and there is little or no respect on the part of the community for the class as a result.<br>
<br>
For the oponent of such an overpowered char pvp is frustrating and lame because there is no excitement when the outcome is not only allready certain but beyond your ability ot effect and control.<br>
<br>
Again Mannaburn fits that description. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usollaiel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sollaiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/29/02 7:56:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Well, I don't see any sense in nerfing Spell output by 20-30% if resists aren't as well.. <br>

<br>
Spell dmg is nerfed in pvp for a very simple reason.  The game as a whole was designed with pve in mind and balanced with pve in mind.  Consequently spell dmg is too great for pvp. Thus its nerfed.<br>
<br>
I don't see how it follows from the above that resists also need to be nerfed by the same degree. <br>
<br>
&quot;Plus.. I don't feel sorry for any of the classes that eat a good manaburn  Afterall, the Melee has the upper hand by far already.&quot;<br>
<br>
What melees? All of them? I don't think so.  Maybe 60 pally/sk are overpowered.  NTOV equiped melee probably are.  What about the rest of us?  What about the fact that its unbalanced vs all classes not just melees?  What about the fact that the whole above statement is utterly flawed? <br>
<br>
Your saying melees are overpowered vs casters its fair to make one caster class grossly overpowered vs all melee, all casters, and all priests. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/29/02 12:20:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re</span><hr size=1> Ok, so spell damaged was designed for pve in mind.

This makes it immposible for the casters to get effective spells off without being resisted (their are some notable exceptions, but mostly HIGH level, such as some magic based DoTs like splurt, Winged Death, and Lures and such). The problem is that Verant's solution, while a good idea in theory to me, of suggested levels (making them not work well below them also) is so out of whack, it's retarded. They have the level restrictions on some things so high they will never get used, cause you can get something equal or better from an easier and lower level mob to fight somewhere else. <br>
<br>
Another idea is to cap resistances on a per level basis for PvP. But again that has inherent flaws (what is an acceptable level, and to whom is it acceptable). Suffice it to say, at level 15 vs level 15, root should not be resisted on average of 14 out of 15 times. If done properly it may alleviate some of the caster griefs with twinkage at lower levels in PvP (the damage cap helps balance the weapons a bit, in my opinion). The biggest complaint is as always, twinkage of melee far outweighs twinkage of casters (great I have 220 Int or Wis, does not help save me from getting spanked by similiarly twinked warrior).<br>
<br>
As it stands, PvP is about 60-70 (at least) percent gear based. Skill can only take you so far if you can't land nukes, or in melee you hit for 80's max and get hit for 150+ each pass (even out jousting 3 hits to 1, you will most likely lose with the lesser damage output). At higher levels some of this starts to change, but I think it only changes at the extreme high end (say 55+). And that is due to your level catching up to the gear (or ability to get some of the twinkage gear). Some classes are inherently flawed too (enchanter cannot lower MR more than a Shaman can..???) but that is another topic as always. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usollaiel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sollaiel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/30/02 10:20:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I think we all agree...</span><hr size=1> I have to agree there.. <br>

Level caps (like DMG cap) would be best.. After 50, those resists make a bit of sense. At level 13, they do not..<br>
<br>
And as for the Enchanter.. I agree 100%. Tash just doesn't do the trick at that level, considering how poorly enchanters nuke vs. other casting classes. <br>

Exactly what was melee damage designed for? &quot;<br>
<br>
Melee dmg was indeed designed for pve as well but it allready carries its own inherent nerf for pvp. Specificly in pve the melee range bug isn't an issue.  This weakens melees enough as it is.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cleric can't get a nuke through 98% of the time in PvP.. That's fair?&quot;<br>
<br>
Clerics are enourmously strong defensively.  They can outheal any manna based dmg dealer and outlast any duel wielder with ds (coldain ring or shaman potion) + heals.  Short of MB a high lvl cleric should be unkillable 1 vs 1.  Just their presence swings a group fight enourmously towards whichever side they support.  They shouldn't be very strong offensively.  That being so Judgement was still hitting me for 2-450 dmg through 190 mr the other day.<br>
<br>
&quot;Last night, my humble 10 Wizard couldn't get a nuke off on a Level 10 SK!&quot;<br>
<br>
My resist cap suggestion would fix that...<br>
<br>
&quot;Twinkage or no.. The resist system is fried..&quot;<br>
<br>
At low levels its friend purely because of twinkage.  Fix the twinkage aleviate the problem entirely for those levels. <br>
<br>
&quot;Even at 46, my paladin can't get root to stick on anyone his level.. How is that balanced?&quot;<br>
<br>
Roots/snares/blinds should be 100% resistable at high lvls with the apropriate resist gear.  Know why? Because roots/blinds/snares that weren't would be enourmoustly overpowered.  If your roots did indeed stick reliably at that point would any caster even stand a chance?<br>
