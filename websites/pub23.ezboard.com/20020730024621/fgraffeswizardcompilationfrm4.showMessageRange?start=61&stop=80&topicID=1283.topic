Yup, I don't think they were the forerunners of any significant change in rock music in their time.  To claim so, you'll have to count bands that were doing the same thing at the time like Megadeath, Anthrax, or Slayer.<br>

American rock and roll stallwarts are the individuals, not groups. I dont know if that is coincidence or cultural in some way.  Everything, and I maen everything that is considered rock today can be traced to 4 americans and the Beatles.  Chuck Berry, Elvis, Bob Dylan, and Jimi Hendrix.  Those 5 are way above the rest in influence and talent.  And I am being generous to Chuck and Jimi, because they each in their own way fundamentally changed the way the game is played.

Yeah, you might be right about the Stripes/Strokes.  System of a Down is pretty unique I must agree.  If we're going to get into modern day unique sounds I have to throw in Primus and Slovak-era Red Hot Chili Peppers.  <br>
<br>
But as much as I love these bands, I'd still have a hard time thinking that 20 years from now we'll look back and say they changed the music scene.   You got stuff that's really good but they never make it mainstream enough to influence the masses.<br>

<br>
To say that Pink Floyd doesn't belong on the list of greatest rock bands of all time is ludicrous.  Love 'em or hate 'em, they were the forerunners of electronic music.  No one even thought of the stuff they were producing back when they made it.  Many, many rock bands around today will trace their roots to Pink Floyd.  U2...  they owe a lot to bands like The Cure, but assuredly they added new influences to music.  Can't say I'm too big of a fan of theirs, but they were very influential (early in their careers until near the middle).<br>
<br>
Hoobastank makes me want to fucking puke.  They aren't doing anything different; they sound like every other 2 guitar 1 bass 1 drum band the industry has tried to push since 1997.  Linkin Park was an assembly band- they produce interesting music though and with some seasoning could be promising; but they won't be legends or even considered greats 10 years from now.  Their new record will get the shit promoted out of it; but that doesn't mean it'll be any good.... we'll have to see.  PoD... won't be greats, but people will refer to their work later as people who forged the rap/rock industry.  And as much as it hurts me to say so, Limp Bizkit will (maybe) be remembered for how they changed rap/rock early in their careers, but that will probably be forgotten as people will recall how they sold out and produced 2 crappy albums and a SLEW of crappy bands... and least they brought Staind to the forefront; another band that won't be remembered well 10-15 years from now but will be referred to.<br>
<br>
Korn... they borrowed heavily from bands such as White Zombie and Pantera.  They weren't that original; just warped around stuff that was already produced.  After their first album (forgot the name of it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) they created some interesting music (&quot;Freak on a Leash&quot;), but didn't change much that was already out there.  Creed brought Christian Rock to the forefront; and that is a god-awful genre to get started in, as you have so many people working against you because traditionally, it just doesn't sell.  There's a mess of Christian Rock bands out there, but almost none of them gain any sense of popularity.<br>
<br>
The bands that will make rock/alternative from the past 10 years?  Tool has a very good chance; Lateralus was one of the best albums produced in recent memory; I don't expect anything similar for a follow-up, and I don't expect a follow-up soon... but it'll be good.  Tool is one of the few bands with the brass to stand up to the music industry or the nod from them to do what they wish- so many labels try to rush out new albums from their bands so they can sell more copies so they can make more money- Lateralus was 5 years in the making, a LONG time for a band that hardly tours.  (A profit based system is not good for art at all.)  A Perfect Circle fits in there as well; very few people did what they were putting out and did it well.  System of a Down holds promise, but they aren't close to made yet; &quot;Toxicity&quot; was a great album but they need more.  Smashing Pumpkins will be most remembered for their earlier work (&quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, &quot;Melancholy and the Infinite Sadness&quot;), but I think many non-2/1/1 bands will refer to &quot;Machina: The Machines of God&quot; and &quot;Machina II: Friends and Enemies of Modern Music&quot; as influential albums- there are some truly amazing tracks on those (Machina II was released to 25 members of their fan club and can be downloaded from their website- members of the band have encouraged downloading Machina I but it remains illegal to do so).  Too bad hardly anyone bought Machina I. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Few bands have the guts to try something new when their old stuff pays so well, and I've got great respect for that.  (And before anyone gets on my case for my rant on Our Lady Peace's new album in THAT thread, their new album is new to THEM, but was released by Matchbox 20 about 5 years ago.)  Incubus HAD promise- S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is still among my all time top 10, but I don't even know what kind of crap they're putting out now.  Crap that makes girls swoon I guess; &quot;Make Yourself&quot; was a decent album I could follow and get into, but I just can't find myself enjoying this new album; too repetitive and has no original flair.  It sells though... so... *sigh*.  Maybe they'll change it up some with the next one, but I fear they have decided to tread the path so many other bands have.<br>
<br>
I'm struggling to find some bands that are still producing quality music these days, but it's hard.  A lot of very good music gets pushed to the background because it's easier to push lousy 2/1/1 bands with a catchy voice.  You turn on the radio to hear 10 Incubus wannabe bands, 10 Linkin Park wannabe bands, bands with a catchy lead singer but little musical talent, and Tool.  I don't like the direction the music industry is taken; whereas before the fans chose what we would and would not swallow, it's become a matter of (as I think Reel Big Fish put it), &quot;radio says it's cool, so I guess I'll believe it&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umacfudd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Macfudd</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/13/02 3:18:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=71>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Music</span><hr size=1> Good to see Tool mentioned.  They put on a great concert, and visited NZ twice within the space of a year, the number of big international bands that do that can be counted on one hand.  Thier last album taking 5 years to come out was due to contractual problems wasnt' it?<br>
<br>
The real big problem with picking modern influential stuff is that these days changes are brought about by marketing and the industry itself deciding what will and won't make it based on money.  When a company can go out on a limb with something innovative or churn out another teen in hotpants (male or female) and rake in easy money which does it choose?<br>
I gave up listening to the radio when I turned it on once to hear a line from the #1 song saying &quot;Motivate me, get me out of bed&quot; or something to that effect.  Seriously, if it's going to be bs, at least put a little damn effort into it.  When you have a band like Tool writing a song that follows the Fibonachi sequence, heck, I've had Uni lecturers refer to Tool song lyrics several times in poetry papers, I remain unable to comprehend how people keep buying trendyband/artistoftheweek01's first and only album.<br>
<br>
I give props to any band or singer these days that writes their own music, especially if they put decent effort into their music videos like Tool or Korn.  Here in NZ, one of the regular free to air channels plays music videos on Thurs/Fri/Sat nights after midnight.  Most of it, and every other music program on tv is basically all useless pop, but every Sat night, the top 10 is filled with great stuff, Pink Floyd, Tool, System of a Down, anything thats not pop basically.  The host for the section is an ex member of a 5 girl popstar group put together by a tv show and her whines each week for everyone to 'vote something good in this time please' are hilarious.<br>

The beauty of Tool is that there is a definite effort to make MUSIC, something complex and moving, not just boring single riff/beat/chorus crap that the likes of Linkin Park are spewing.  I am also really fascinated with the flexibility of Maynard's voice, he can be crooning some soft melody and then suddenly be near screaming and it never sounds forced or stilted or innappropriate.  To me there is a big difference between playing songs and making music.  Tool may never be considered a warranted addition to the list that started this thread, in fact i hope their popularity never grows to those levels for purely selfish reasons, (i like to be able to actually see the band when i go to a concert, not have to watch a giant TV set so i can make out which speck is which) but Tool really is a great band.<br>

Saw them again a few years later at the 3rd Lollapalooza and was really saddened at how much of their edge and stage presence was ruined by playing the large venue. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uclaudshadowflare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ClaudShadowflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/13/02 6:13:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.the-commune.com/forum/images/avatars/40.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Music</span><hr size=1> Primus dies at a large venue. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Seen em at a small radio show and at Lollapalooza myself, and the difference is staggering.<br>

And the delay in Lateralus was caused by Maynard's absence to APC.  While he was touring/producing with them, the remaining members of the band wrote the music; when he came back they toyed with it and he wrote lyrics to match the music.  One of Keenan's pearls of wisdom he throws out in the rare interviews he gives is that the lyrics to Tool's songs are nearly meaningless; he says it's the music that matters more.  Focusing on the lyrics to Lateralus and the music to Lateralus are quite different animals. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uluxum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/13/02 6:24:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Music</span><hr size=1> Heh he may think the lyrics are meaningless but i'd say far from it.  Lateralus has some very interesting Buddhist references to consciousness and the universe which i really enjoy.  The older albums have definite references to social issues as well.  The lyrics do have a poetry that stands apart from the instrumental parts of the music, and there is something really entrancing about the way he fits the rhythmn of the vocal line into the overall musical pattern of the songs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uluxum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/13/02 6:26:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Music</span><hr size=1> Heh and on a side note, Tool's videos totally freak me out.

I may be influenced to a degree by the fact that I did not really care very much for their sound, I will admit that.   I really think their guitar player was/is great though.  Sure they belong on a greatest rock band of all time list, it just depends on how long that list is.  It probably isn't right but when most people are asked to name a &quot;clasical&quot; composer, they will say Beethoven or Mozart.  Hunderds of years from now, people will still know the names Elvis, Dylan, The Beatles.  These other bands, while great, rightly or wrongly will not be. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uravensloche.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravensloche</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/13/02 7:17:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1283.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.v-d-p.net/files/dolls/ravendoll.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rock</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

Absolutely true.<br>
One of the problems with Rating music is that it is a subjective endeavor... everyone will have at LEAST a slightly differing opinion on what is good, what is influential, etc.<br>
<br>
...except new country. It just plain sucks, period, and anyone who disagress with that is a wanker. LOL<br>

I'll have to give them that. I saw them a couple times before Undertow came out and they just blew me away. I haven't seen them since but I am still blown away by their music. I am glad that they are moving forward as artists.. all their albums have been great athough I do wish they were more prolific.<br>
<br>
I've really just turned off my radio and started to rely more on word of mouth for good bands. Some good bands I've found recently are Medeski Martin and Wood (I've said I like that Jazzy sound) and G Love and Special Sauce. I always loved Morphene (some of the coolest, and spookiest, concerts I've seen) but I think they have broken up. I've also been enjoying bands like the Underworld, Orbital and the Chemical Brothers.. and I personally think that there is a lot of potential in techno (although there is a lot of potential for techno garbage too). I am really loosing my interest in almost all radio rock.<br>
<br>
Now this is just my opinion so it doesn't mean much but.. Many of the bands that have been listed here recently sound like a bunch of cry-babys to me.. and that makes me feel old I guess. I just don't get it. Bunch of whiners. I think it was on one of Korn first couple albums that the singer even started to cry.. and he kept on crying for like two minutes. It's always suprised me that a musician can get well into their 20's and still whine about what their parents, or what the world have done to them, and not get bored as hell. I guess it helps them pick the pockets of all those angry teens out there though. Although I have to admit that I did hear a Korn tune off their new album (on the radio, LOL! I guess I still listen to it occasionally while driving) and I kind of liked it.<br>

It's hard to say who will be remembered from todays music.
