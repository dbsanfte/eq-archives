One suggestion might be to have different rules for BP/legs and other drops. That's actually how TON handles it for their Kael raids. Laurri keeps track of how many raids you have been on and keeps this updated on the web site. The person with the most raids gets the BP/leg drop with no roll. Other drops are rolled as long as you have been on one raid before(more or less). People on 1st raid cant roll on anything unless no one else wants. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvainne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/12/01 5:34:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http--braggarts.shareplay.com-pics-Wythe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: a suggestion, and a lil rant</span><hr size=1> /e agree Niema<br>

&quot;My idealistic hippieish wish would be for classes present to discuss amongst themselves if any major pieces should go to certain &quot;vets&quot; that would benefit more than they could. Perhaps unrealistic it's what we've for the most part always done in my little flock. I've seen members of all our guilds performing random acts of selflessness so it may not be as unrealistic as i think&quot;<br>

<br>
I have been on the same type of planes raids you have been on and seen the same things happen and have felt the same things for the most part. If we are holding an open raid then there is no way that we could possibly have rules like that. Everyone would have to roll. I maintain though that after one or 2 planes raids most planar ready people are up there for loot. We have had incidents, like in the last fear raid, where the TOE druid got her BP and gated out.<br>
<br>
Now as an example. Zombei and myself have gone to every SGA hate raid. The next raid comes along and we have a level 47 war that's brand new to the planes. If zombei and I have lost every roll in the past few raids is it really fair to either of us that we roll on the BP with the first timer. Zom has 3 hate raids under his belt, I have 7 or 8 under mine. At what point do we take that into account? Shouldn't the members of the SGA that always go in support of these raids come first?<br>
<br>
Another example. The last raid; boots, BP, legs, gaunts all dropped. I have the boots, I have had the boots for months. Unfortunately the boots dropped last so I had to roll on everything else except the boots cutting my chances of winning anything down more then the rest. <br>
<br>
This isn't really about looting something Phat to sell this is about improving your character in order to improve survivability in the future, when the SGA goes to do something else. This is also about taking care of the people that are always there, first. Planes raids can be trying on ones nerves. They are long expensive ventures at times and outside of the first few times one goes most people do go to the planes to get loot for their character/guild.<br>
<br>
If we go to the planes, I will admit I would rather see Zombei, Bslayton or Bamil get loot over some guy that has just shown up and is surfing pickup raids in order to improve his character. I have seen far to often that the people I speak of care nothing for who the go with as long as they get something out of it.<br>
<br>
Some point in the very near future we will have more members that can go to the planes then are neccessary to do them. We had 5 groups this last time that were all SGA and 50 plus. How do we tell our members sorry we have to many because Joe_an _uber _wannabe_01 wants to go, so you can't. There is a limitation to the number of people that can be effective on a planes raid before lag makes fighting unbareable. Fear is a big zone Hate is not, the SW camp and Zone in has somewhat of a physical limitation to how many can sit there. <br>
<br>
These are all things to consider when it comes down to loot rules. In a ideal perfect world enough armor would drop so that everyone could get something. The planes are just not like that. Also I don't want to slight the people that always go over the first timer that shows just to get loot. Sure he is welcome to loot but I think my friends needs come first as they are always with us in groups and on raids. I know you may think this is a uber guild attitude but to be honest it's the way I feel. The first timer will more then likely not go due to any rules like this but it will weed out the loot whores.<br>
<br>
On the flip side we could host an open raid once amonth that has a everyone roll policy in order to help these guys out and give them that chance. I personaly just don't want every raid like that.<br>

<br>
Now I also see that most of your feelings are more for open, everyone rolls raids, I fully agree, if the raid is &quot;open&quot; and anyone can come, then yeah, everyone that can should roll.<br>
<br>
When I slide into a raid with another guild I tell the guild leader &quot;I am here for fun/faction/fun/friends, if I happen go get some loot, ok, but thats not what I am there for.<br>
<br>
If I was main puller for a raid that I had spent weeks planning, researching, gathering proper folks together for, then I will expect a peice of the pie.<br>
<br>
This the difference, pickup/open raids VS planned events.<br>
<br>
Now Hareq, I respect you, I have sorely wanted to go on raids you have led, but was too low at the time, I still await a pickup raid on Saryrn Tavern posted by Hareq, don't care where or when, if I aint at work I be there!<br>
I still think many SGA members consider your opinion valid, and a nice unbiased voice, so please do not start withdrawing your posts.<br>

<br>
Look...do you realize how many people you are potentially talking about being involved in these raids?<br>
<br>
Who is going to keep track of who has what, and who got what?<br>
<br>
It's not a job I would wish on my worst enemy.<br>
<br>
I agree that the raid planners and pullers should get a piece of the pie: perhaps the option of calling a specific item, or cash loot, their choice. I don't think anyone will disagree with you there.<br>
<br>
But most importantly, we're raiding to have fun...right?<br>
<br>
Right guys? I mean...how much of a job do you want this to be?<br>
<br>
If you want to organize a small raid and set forth specific rules to govern it, there is no obstacle standing in your way.<br>
<br>
Again though I'd like to point out why I think the merit system wont work for us, the SGA, as a whole:<br>
<br>
1.) We are too large--administration nightmare<br>
2.) We were  formed as an alternative for the casual player to participate in raids...without havoing to attend them five times a week.<br>
<br>
In most cases I'd believe in a merit system. In the case of the SGA I predict it wont work. Be happy to be proven wrong though, but don't think I am. <p><b> ~The Nightblind Bard~
