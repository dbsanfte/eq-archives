After the 9th kill, shortly after the previous post, I finally got my GBS!!<br>
<br>
I am thrilled, to say the least!  Solusek Ro be praised!<br>
<br>
She was coming over the hill towards the ruins, straight out from the center of the ruins, at about 12 midnight.  <br>
<br>
On a side note:  the earliest I've personally witnessed Pyzjn spawn was 9pm gametime, and the latest was 5am gametime. <br>

You are full of shit and you know it and your also a prick for leading people on and then saying your not telling how cause it would drop the price of the GBS. ROFL! Next I would like to say after killing Pyzjn 6 times I got my GBS and I think I know why on the 6th time I killed her she had it. <br>
 HERES HOW...<br>
 Let her walk to the runes before you wack her. Yep, its that easy! Thats what I did this time and she had the stone. How and where dose she spawn you ask? Well I found that clearing all the skellys around the runes helps and every time I killed her she spawned down the road from surfall glade and then walked over that ridge/hill to the runes.<br>
  There is NO quest for her giving by the guards and no trigger!! she is random like all the other rare random spawns are and just take the time to camp them.<br>
 Hope this helps anyone tring for the item.

<br>
When I got my GBS, I was ready to log, but stood up for one last look-see.  And there was Pyzjn right in the middle of the ruins with pet!  I must have been asleep or something, because I was surprised to see she had time to make her pet without me hearing the cast.  She did not walk up to the ruins, or I would have seen her.<br>
<br>
I've killed her five times, twice in the ruins, three times walking to the ruins.  Only once did she drop the GBS while in the ruins.  I've also heard of others getting the stone without her being in the ruins.<br>
<br>
So, maybe there's a 10% probability of her dropping the stone <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  AWAY</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> from the ruins, and a 50%(?) probability of dropping it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  AT</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the ruins.  After reading most of the accounts of aquiring the GBS, most people just casually run up to the ruins, kill Pyzjn in the ruins, and she drops the stone.  There is reason to believe that she has a higher drop rate while in the ruins.  She doesn't drop it all the time in the ruins, but it may be significantly higher than while she's walking to them.<br>
<br>
The hard part is to convince others to let her walk to the ruins.  If she's anywhere away from the ruins, she's fair game to kill.  I've been sitting at the ruins and have had someone kill her while she was walking to them.  I heard her cast, then heard someone else cast.  And it wasn't me. <p>Xaxia Ataxia<BR>Erudite Wizardess<BR>Of the 23rd Pie<BR>Lanys T'Vyl</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxaxia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaxia</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://members.prestige.net/chosenofnorrath/images/xaxia.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 10/4/00 7:09:24 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaaeandarvie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aaeandar Vie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/6/00 4:57:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pyzjn Quest (Qhills)</span><hr size=1> Ok Drakos..<br>

first off...<br>
I didnt claim to know the quest to get her to spawn, but I know that there is one.  I talked to a guy that personally has one on every characters.  He told me that he wouldnt tell me the quest because I was in a guild, and he couldn't trust the secret with me.  However...<br>
<br>
He has said (along with at least 17 other people I've talked to) if you have the highest amiable faction with the Temple of Life and say certain keywords (dont know what they are) to the guards in Qhills, you can get Pyzjn to spawn once every 3 hours easily.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should read posts better, instead of jumping to quick conclusions.  Maybe then I wouldn't have to take time out of my day to respond to your jerk off behavior and remind you that this whole thread is a question into what people know and what they don't know about her spawn.  So, if you feel like you have to shoot off at the mouth and be such a big man flaming someone on a message board, I suggest you use a little more intelligence when doing it because you've only managed to make an idiot out of yourself this time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udrackos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drackos</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/7/00 12:05:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Can make her spawn every 3 hours?

<br>
Fact is, there is a much looked over quest with npcs in QHills that 'can' trigger her to spawn.  If you don't want to believe me then fine.  Fact is, I'm looking it up, and I'm willing to say that there is a quest that she's involved in.<br>
<br>
Verant and other sources say that there are a lot of quests that are hidden in the game.  Most are undiscovered, like the original FA quest laid dorment for monthes because no one was able to find the npcs or items.<br>
<br>
Whether the quest I'm speaking of does or does not spawn her, I've seen evidence to lead me to the belief that it is there.  There are key words, and weird intiquacies I'm testing out.  I'm getting a cleric friend of mine who has the highest amiable to the temple of life to try out the key words I've found so far.  I've found several quests in Qhills that no one seems to know the reward, or finish to.  I've asked lots of people, consulted many boards, and the people I've talked to who 'claim' to have made her spawn all say the same thing:<br>
<br>
The dead end quests in Qhills all make reference to her, varsoon, and tovax in one way or another.<br>
<br>
Like I said, if you believe me or not is up to you, but the fact is, I posted this topic to see if anyone who reads this board knows.  Call me a fool, but I'm still going to look.<br>
<br>
There is a trick to her spawn, and there is a reason she only seems to spawn for like 5 minutes at a time.  There is just something about her spawn cycle that is odd, and screams quest.  Whether the quest is there or not, you have to admit, its odd.<br>

Druids - BAH!  Theiy don't even NEED the intelligence bonus!  Anyway - I digress.  I wanted to ask about two things I recently heard.<br>
<br>
1)  Somebody recently told me that as of the latest patch, the GBS no longer drops.  I certainly haven't heard anything about this, and I'm a bit hesitant to believe it - he could have just been trying to steal my camp.  (camping her for so long makes you a bit paranoid of KSers, doesn't it?)  Does anyone know anything about this?<br>
<br>
2)  A few of you have been talking on here about some Pyzjn quest.  Personally, I'm of the mind that she's random.  HOWEVER - I recently found this post on www.everlore.com - now, we all know the problems with Everlore, and I usually don't believe ANYTHING I see posted there, but I found this rather interesting.  My Qeynos faction is trashed from killing treants, so I can't test this, but I figured someone on here might be able to.  If you do, I'd like to know how it turns out.  =)<br>
<br>
(the following is snipped from Everlore)<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
ok, ive camped the GBS many lonesome hours, i have never gotten it, but i know a way to make her spawn. my druid friend did this and it worked. its best if you have track, but if you dont its hard to do, find tovax, and dont let anyone, or any NPC's kill him, he is a very low lvl NPC, and is KOS to many other NPC's in QH, keep him alive long enough and he will walk to the ruins, he stands there for about 1 or 2 minutes then he disapears leaving only a bag, make sure your bound at the ruins, run into NQ, make sure its between 9pm-3am gametime, as she only spawns at night, find a guy named Roseager something he walks around the gates of QH, give him the item tovax dropped, he will say some dumb crap and GATE!!! because you got 4 possibilities, Tovax respawned, varsoon spawned, varsoon the undieing spawned, or The damn lil gnome spawned, i know its a pain in the ass, but it works, and as far as i know its the only way to make her spawn, plus on TZ they go for ALOT, like a frog crown and an smr, but thats resist gear, and you no pvpers might not understand the importance, when i get mine, im keeping that cant beat 10mr in the hands, with 9 int, but you cant hold stein of moggok and gbs to my knowledge, thought id let everyone in on a lil secret =P <br>
<br>
--------------(end snip)-------------------------------------------<br>

Hmmmm.... sounds interesting, but I question how much he actually knows about this.  =/<br>

<br>
I start many of new chars in the Qeynos area when a new server opens. One thing I have seen on Luclin, Lanys and Torv is that Pyzjin spawns alot more than it appears to on the more 'established' servers.<br>
<br>
That is probably a result of several things...newbies all over zone, so ph's are getting killed....no one can solo Tovax so they all avoid him and let him follow his pathing...lots of quests being initiated in the Qeynos, QHills, Surefall area...etc.,<br>
<br>
There are many 'tricks' in the game that are known by few players...things like getting Hasten to spawn, what ph's are for the AC, and so on. And no one who knows these will just show up on a msg board and post them for the world to see...Knowledge is power, the folks that successfully figure these out are not just going to give it away.<br>
<br>
The best you can hope for on quests like this is about 80% of the information needed...so research it the best you can on boards and such, then do it yourself and try a different approach each time and eventually you may discover it on your own. <br>

<br>
Your first point is a most common one.  After every patch, there are always those that will start a rumor that the GBS doesn't drop anymore.  It's due to frustration and lack of getting the coveted stone after many hundreds of boring hours camping Pyzjn.  Believe me, the GBS still drops.  I got one right after someone said that it didn't drop anymore due to a patch.  Lol.<br>
<br>
Your second point is an urban legend.  These types of things are common when someone likes to instill doubt and chaos into an environment that already holds a certain degree of longing to believe that the falsehood is true.  It stems from lack of knowledge or just plain stupidity.  I have yet to see ANY type of quest work to obtain the GBS.  And from the data that I've collected on Pyzjn, her drop rate, and her spawn rate, I've come to the conclusion that she is similar to the Ancient Cyclops that drops the ring for the Jboot quest.  Basically, the drop of the GBS is like the drop of the ring: they are not on a timed drop table.  Both drops are rare enough that they could be considered &quot;random.&quot;<br>
<br>
Those that claim that there is a quest have NEVER stepped forward to show its truth.  Excuses will be made that making public the quest would drive GBS prices down.  This is simply a cover of the cowardice that these people have.<br>

Someone on the morell has 3 of them and they said they did the quest.  And everyone who claims to have done the quest says the same thing:<br>
<br>
Special keywords to Qhills guards, and a return/delieveer quest.<br>
<br>
I only brought it up (again) to see if those who did have clues about the quest would post it.  I have enough evidence to say she is triggered, but I also have my doubts.  Its just the wizard version of lord grimrot.  Lots of theories, no real evidence.<br>

<br>
Not that I believe there is a quest for it, Moorpheus (in fact I have to side with Xaxia on this one, I think such a quest is purely urban legend), but you can easily get multiple lore items using mule characters and a little guild/friend help - you just can't have them on the same character at the same time.  When I first heard of the stone I went to check it out, and there was a high level druid camping her so I thought I'd watch and see how it was done - you know, see who he killed, if there were PH's etc.  Anyway, I spent the better part of the evening just watching and talking to him.  He already had 4 GBS's (he was farming them to raise guild money) all on various mule characters.  During the span of the evening he was lucky enough to get another, and no sooner did he have it than a guildmember gated in and took it so he could keep camping.<br>
<br>
I guess you can make a tidy profit doing this, but God only knows how you could camp there that long without going insane.  I certainly wouldn't want to - what a waste of good playing time.  I gave up before even getting ONE!  Not worth it to me to camp it, I'll get my bonuses elsewhere. <p><b>Arundel Pajo</b><br>

<br>
Also.. some new info:<br>
<br>
There is a way to get her to spawn jsut by picking which mobs you kill around the ruins.  I'm going to get the info from a guildie in the near future (we had a few raids today).<br>
<br>
Also...<br>
<br>
The ph for the ac in sro... &lt;drumroll&gt; the undead tower near the wizard spire.  That is no big secret.<br>
<br>
The ac in oot, well, if you cant figure that one out, you got problems.<br>
<br>
Teh difference with teh aC and Pyzjn... AC is very rare, with defined phs.  Pyzjn is rare with no definite ph.<br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
However, I'm not counting out the quest still.  There is just too much screaming quest here.  I mean, you just gotta look at the way she spawns... its not always at night, and its always jsut at od times.  /shrug  I spent 5 hours today just killing stuff, no pyzjn.  Everyone I know with one, seems to know a secret to make her spawn.  Maybe its not a quest, but its just a tactic.  The has a ph, same with varsoon, and we all know who is Tovax's ph<br>

I hailed Boondin. He conned amiable to me and I tried several times using different keywords to get him to 'open up', but was unsuccessful.<br>
<br>
The little gnome wouldnt say a thing to me. I was about to waste him and his pet with a single blast, but decided I'd wait and try again to get him to speak to me another time.<br>
<br>
Anyone else have any luck talking to him? There is a lengthy discourse over on Everlore supposedly detailing the story of Pyzjn, Pyzjin and Varsoon, but I'm starting to wonder if this is all someone's idea of a hoax. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urizzyndevoker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rizzyn DeVoker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/8/00 3:24:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Boondin Babbinsbort</span><hr size=1> Has anyone with a GBS found Varsoon and talked to him? Or is he KoS to everyone?<br>
I am just wondering, if the GBS is his black heart, and it is part of a bigger quest (or just the GBS is the final of the quest). Why not find Varsoon, hail him (if he isn't KoS), and say something like &quot;I have returned your black heart&quot;.<br>
I have not tried this, as i haven't seen varsoon, i have only seen pyzjin once (got kill, got GBS). <br>
Weither or not the GBS is part of bigger quest, or if in fact pyzjin is just a random spawn, with a random loot.<br>
And i am sure, no one will be willing to give the GBS back to varsoon, as they will be afraid to loose such a rare item.<br>
Just some thoughts i have had.<br>
