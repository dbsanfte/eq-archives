I'd really rather see them balanced through more spells or innate class skills, or a lower level AA skill tree for the 30-50 people<br>
<br>
How are current and future zones/mobs balanced with these new items.<br>
Focus items seem like a gameplay tuning nightmare because you either design them so their effects are minimal (not really contributing to 'balance', just giving the false sense they are) or they are made stronger which may make current/future encounters trivial and may have to be retuned or made harder had the items not existed which leaves you back where you started.<br>
<br>
Can you do 1 more quad on your wizard because you have focus items for mana preservation and range which helps keep you alive and avoid deaths better?<br>
<br>
Casters since the patch are now weaker if you consider the upgrade to caster npc's. If any caster class is now more in demand its going to be enchanters (like they needed more reasons to be picked for a group <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) to quickly mez/stun the crap out of any casters that get pulled so they dont mez or AoE the crap out of you.<br>
<br>
The same froglok ilis wizard people killed a week ago now tosses ice comets in their face and you still get the same damn amount of xp. Noone's bitching of course because they all think they are mad uber now with these new focus effects. The items are still weak if you compare a focus3 item to stuff like fungi tunic on a melee.<br>
<br>
There are some focus item effects are nice (reagent conservation 3 = less peridots used by my cleric) but I don't recall my cleric actually hurting for 'caster balance' like my mage and wizard are <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Some of the effects on the focus items i'm seeing are about as useful or as powerful as CHA on my warriors armor <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have to agree with others that they made too many focus types which creates a false sense of complexity and really screws with 'what caster should get this item' because people will weigh the focus effect more heavily than the other stats when in some cases it shouldn't.<br>
<br>
I think verant is trying too hard to come up with new gameplay/item angles and creating excess complexity where it is not needed that borders on tedious.<br>
<br>
An example of tedium being swapping in an rmb on my cleric whenever she uses symbol(for a chance at not using the peridot) because her normal bracers without the focus effect are better for normal use.<br>
<br>
Just some rambling for someone that wants a good reason to un retire her wizard and mage that doesn't revolve around focus items<br>

They are only one aspect of caster balance, not the end-all of it.  The particular issue they were trying to address with focus items is the disparity between the level 60 caster that spends a lot of time getting nice gear versus the level 60 melee who does the same.  A level 60 rogue with Ntov/Luclin weapons is *way* more effective then a 60 rogue with RB/kunark/velious weapons.  A level 60 wizard with ntov/luclin stuff is marginally better (although AA abilities help a lot, it still just rewards leveling pretty much exclusively). By putting these focus on difficult encounters, they allow casters to actually have something to look forward to.<br>
<br>
That being said I don't think the implementation is quite right.  I wouldve suggested using level limits and percentage differences.  The level limit would determine what level dungeon you would get it, and the percentage would indicate the difficulty of that dungeon relative to your level.<br>
<br>
So the low level, low percentage would be easy to get.  Maybe even put it on the newbie quests.  The higher percentage low level focus would then be put in dungeons. Thus, the low level who spent time collecting nice gear would actually be better off then the one who just tries to level as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
The same would be true of the higer level focus.  Low percentage would drop in seb/HS/chardok/velks/etc.  The higher percentage ones would drop off raid level mobs.  <br>
<br>
This is over simplified, I would do more then just 2 different percentages, but you get the point. <br>

I'm fairly casual in my playing myself, don't stress on the focus.<br>
Personally I think that adding in a few quests for higher level focus would be great, quests that don't require uber mob kills but lots of long slow questing.  Then everyone would be happy.  Everyone can access the focus stuff, whether they get it from a drop, EC or the long quest.  Your choice.  Only play an hour or two a week?  Then you have to decide whether to farm loot, level or sink a couple months into getting a Focus III item.<br>
<br>
That's what Verant says the big PoP quest will be like (barring the EC bit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) so I wouldn't be surprised to see a whole lot of focus items come out with it, including focus quests.  But most of all I would like to remind everyone, it's the first focus patch.  First, not last.  They will add more, and I imagine Verant is keeping a good look out for good ideas for the next wave of focus items. <br>

<br>
But if they are ment to balance casters they fail to do that.<br>
<br>
Everyone agrees that a lv60 wizard with all spells, AA and good equipment is already close to being balanced.<br>
<br>
Lower lv wizards and lv60 wizards without the best spells and good equipment need to be balanced.<br>
<br>
I mean some extra damage from lv51-lv60 would help and would be good balancing.<br>
The lv3 focus items will not help these players much.<br>
I´m not sure if they where ment to do that.<br>
But its not very strange that players that hoped they would are disappointed at the moment.<br>
<br>
The few dmg3 focus items(and with other good effects for wizards) that exist that are not no drop will of course be very expensive.<br>
Perhaps they will cost 100k. They will not be something that the average lv51 or lv55 player will be able to buy for a few Kpp.<br>
They will not be sold very often. Players that have them will keep them or they have friends that need them.<br>
<br>
It looks like these items are not ment to be common among lv51-lv60 players.<br>

What the fuck, who the hell is Verant to be telling me who I need to be friends with?  I have the most fun in this game by only hanging out with lesbian dark elf enchantresses, and now I have The Vision telling me I need to be friends with mages so I can be balanced??  Me and my friends should have access to every uber item in the game because I SAY SO.  And damnit, none of my lesbian dark elf enchanter friends have KEI yet, can they buy it at level 30?  I hear I need it to be balanced, maybe they can keep casting it for me.  The last time me and my friends and Jabobner tried to kill Rumblecrush because we heard he has some balancing loot on him, we died because those mean things in Maiden's Eye got us. This game is so unfair, it doesn't even let me save and restore when I die <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I wasn't going to respond seriously to this thread, but here you go anyway.<br>
<br>
Which. Part. Of. &quot;Mage Summoned Focus Items.&quot; Do. You. Not. Understand?<br>
<br>
The &quot;balancing&quot; part of these items is meant to be as common as possible.  Anyone, from a level 1 to a level 60 can ask a mage to summon items that, to a wizard, have the SAME effects that any of the &quot;uber l33t&quot; items have.  (Clerics, etc., different story.. thank god this is a wizard board and we can just ignore them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )  Hell, I destroy 3 items that have the equivalent of Spell Haste III, Improved Damage III, and Mana Conservation III on them every night (gasp!).<br>
<br>
What? +6 AC/+20 HP/+20 MANA not good enough for you?  Have something more uber for that slot?  Then no focus for you.  Does every melee have the ability to go ask a mage for a haste item that's equivalent to the highest haste currently on any item in the game?  No.  <br>
<br>
You can either be high enough level/in a strong guild/have lots of friends and get yourself a permanent focus item with good/decent stats, or you can kill brownie guards for 15 minutes each night and ask a mage to summon you an item.  You both get the same focus, and the same damage increase/etc. <p><br>

<br>
Was this meant for me????  Pick a dungeon - other than the 50 plus ones and possibly some on Luclin, chances are I've been there.  I've Fought Upper Guk, Lower Guk, Karnors, Nurga, Droga, Kaesora, Split Paw, Sol A, Sol B, Unrest, Mistmoore, Crystal Caverns, Skyshrine, Najena, The Warrens, Runnyeye(old - haven't been into the New one yet, need to go check it out one of these days) Old Cazic, Kael, Thurgadin, Velketors(sure not all the way back to Velk himself, but I've fought there), Tower of Frozen Shadow, Hell I've even been to Howling Stones once.<br>
<br>
Now the point of that extremely Long run on sentence - I don't play to &quot;Grind&quot; that to me is not fun, so I don't do it.  I play to explore, try new things - and I die Frequently.  I go places that people say are out of my level and fight there successfully - why, For the Challenge.  I group with friends and fight with them, Quest with them, Chat with them.  The point is I don't like the High level raids from what I have seen and heard.  18 groups, 1 group gets XP for everything - 3 people get to loot 1 Item, - Thanks not for me.<br>
<br>
I've also played pretty much every Class to around 30.  I don't think I would find the High-Level Game to be that fun.  So I don't do it, and stick with the Low-Mid level.  <br>
<br>
Does that answer your question Erelious?<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as an Accross the Board Spell Efficiency Upgrade - <br>
<br>
Wasn't one of the main Complaints of the Wizard Community the fact that we simply can't keep up with <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> TWINKED</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Melee's?  That our gear was Lacking in that it didn't really Increase our abilities other than a Larger Mana pool?<br>
In other Words we Had No/Fewer Problems keeping up with Untwinked Melee's?  Trust me there are still a few out there(Rare and Hard to Find, But still there).  So an accross the board change in spell efficiency like that wasn't really Needed in my mind - and would have done More harm than Good.  Wizards allready DESTROY Old World Mobs.<br>
<br>
So they addressed the Problem where it Most needed to be Addressed - Gear, and again - That's still not to say they're done with Balancing, Or even Adding Focus Items.<br>
<br>
Here's something to think about.  How many times in Patch Messages have you seen something that says - Hey we added some new Gear to Mob X, go check it out.  They don't do that because Mob X would get SWARMED.  They want you to Explore - Take Risks, Possibly die, and just maybe have fun.  Therefore isn't it Conceivable that they added some NEW items with Focus effects also?  The 150 spoke about in the Patch Message was just OLD Items that they revised.  So go out take a look around, Have fun.  Just maybe you'll find something New, maybe you Won't - but it doesn't hurt to look right? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/7/02 8:24:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1191.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grim3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well...</span><hr size=1> Rombus while I sympathise with the frustration about every single thing resulting in floods of complaints, and there's certainly something ironic about people complaining that the items they liked and were proud of before now &quot;sucking&quot; because they have a focus effect they can't use... there are some issues I hope Verant works on.<br>
<br>
The distribution is odd, there aren't many focus items out there that notably help damage casters - the casters most in need of help - and some of them are a bit odd in their level range and location.  I'm fine with swapping out items for effects, I lose some mana, gain some efficicency, etc... that's a great change.  I just wonder if some of the effects aren't a bit more common and easy to get as opposed to others.<br>
<br>
There is a good thread on this in the gameplay forum that covers some suggestions on how to make these work better:<br>

And perhaps the same will be true for new focus items if they will have the same difficulty/risk/reward ratio.<br>
<br>
I thought that ratio was ment to be lower.<br>
That the items were intended to be common among lv51-lv60 players.<br>
That a lv55 group with medium equipment should be able to kill a mob that can drop a focus3 item.<br>
<br>
Im not saying that summoned focus items are no good or that they dont help wizards and other casters.<br>
Of course they do.<br>
If I can find a chanter that an give me C3 it will also be a great help.<br>
And yes. I can afford to pay both the mage and the chanter for the help.<br>
<br>
To make my point clear:<br>
The focus effects added to items in the latest patch will not help the average lv51-lv60 player much.<br>
The same will probably be true for future focus3 items if they get the same difficulty/risk/reward ratio.<br>
<br>
Im not saying that its wrong. Just that this is the way it is as far as I can understand.<br>
