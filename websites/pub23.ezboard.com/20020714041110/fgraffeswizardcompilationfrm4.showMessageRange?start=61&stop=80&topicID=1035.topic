To propound anything else would be idiotic.&quot; - Eamin<br>
<br>
The UK propounded just that. They thought it was a great idea for Bobbies not to carry guns.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's highly unlikely that your average crazed teen is going to be able to walk into school with a knife and cause mass destruction.&quot; - Eamin<br>
<br>
First off there is nothing average about a teen that would walk into a school on a killing spree. They is a suprisingly uncommon.<br>
<br>
&quot;Guns are the only thing that keeps things like this happening.&quot; - Eamin<br>
<br>
Actually the Columbine kids had pipe bombs, which had they been employed are far easier to get into school, far more easily deployed around the school, and would have killed far more people with far less risk to themselves.<br>
<br>
Explosives and fire are much better means of killing large numbers of people. To the extent that guns are impossible to interdict, fire and explosives are much more so.<br>
<br>
&quot;Without guns, there would be no way to cause mass death, besides bombs and other explosives&quot; - Eamin<br>
<br>
There are other ways of course, but what is you point?<br>
<br>
&quot;The facts are: if people don't have guns, they will not only be less able to cause mass death (there are exceptions, such as September 11th), but they will be far easier to stop while they are attempting to do what little killing is possible for them.&quot; - Eamin<br>
<br>
That is not a fact, that is a syllogism. Which you have not proved. And can't because the premise is an impossibility.<br>
<br>
Regardless it is easier to stop shooting people than to stop a bomb after it has exploded.<br>
<br>
&quot;Running around in a school nunchucking people to death takes a long, long time.&quot; - Eamin<br>
<br>
This is why no one does that.<br>
<br>
&quot;A woman in a park being assaulted by rapists will be far more able to escape if the rapists don't have guns to shoot her with.&quot; - Eamin<br>
<br>
Most rapists aren't into necrophilia. The joy of rape is the terror and fear inflicted on the victim and the power the rapist feels. Rapists don't generally shoot their victims, and if they do it is after the event.<br>
<br>
&quot;And the rapists will be less likely to attack if they know that there is a chance that their victim can overpower them.&quot; - Eamin<br>

<br>
Explosives and fire are much better means of killing large numbers of people. To the extent that guns are impossible to interdict, fire and explosives are much more so.&quot;<br>

I wasn't talking about the Columbine kids, necessarily. I was talking about all the school shootings where guns were the cause of most of the injury. Guns in the wrong hands.<br>

&quot;Most rapists aren't into necrophilia. The joy of rape is the terror and fear inflicted on the victim and the power the rapist feels. Rapists don't generally shoot their victims, and if they do it is after the event.&quot;<br>

That's why they'd shoot her in the legs and not in a vital body organ.<br>

&quot;Exactly, Eamin now you are getting it If the _woman_ has a weapon in her purse the odds just shifted drastically in her favor. Criminals rarely have any interest in risking their lives, the mere display of a weapon will usually send them in search of easier prey. Guns save lives and deter crime all the time without ever even being used.<br>
<br>
The mere existence of concealed carry laws in ALL cases has lowered crime rate in states with those laws.&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe rapist wasn't the best example, as they generally use their strength to overpower the victim. I'll hand you that outlawing guns wouldn't help lower rape rates.<br>
<br>
However, outlawing guns would significantly cut down on plain old killings. Without guns, the criminals are forced to resort to other weapons. Resorting to other weapons significantly lowers their chances of succeeding with the crime, which will undoubtedly either deterr them from their course of action or enable law enforcement to apprehend them near the beginning of their rampage. Only explosives have more mass slaughter capabilities than guns, and for some odd reason less people are killed per year by explosives than guns.<br>
<br>
I don't feel particularly strong on this issue, but I will say that a country without guns = a safer place.<br>

<br>
<br>
Ever been to Canada, sparky? Guns aren't prohibited, they're controlled. I'm Canadian, but I guess you didn't realize that. I've owned firearms legally, and I've destroyed them. We even have our share of idiot gun nuts like Smartypus, who's also Canadian. His collection of firearms is perfectly legal.<br>
<br>
The difference is that guns are a lot harder to acquire in Canada, and that concealable and repeating firearms are illegal to have. In other words, no handguns, and no fucking machine guns.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as free speech goes? We've got much freer speech than you guys, buddy. You want an example, go read the editorials that get published in &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot;. There's some nitwit religious leader from Ottawa who's been publishing essays on why the Taliban and Al'Qaeda are good. Ever wonder what your FBI would do to somebody that published something like that in the US?<br>
<br>
Did you know that Canada has an active Communist party that runs in federal elections?<br>
<br>
Did you know that Canada has more religious and ethnic diversity than the USA?<br>
<br>
Did you know that the UN has rated Canada the best country to live (based on social freedom and rights) in every year for the last 4 years, and that we've been in the top 3 every year since the mid '60s?<br>
<br>

Do you honestly believe that because I don't own a gun, my government is going to suppress anything I say? You are kidding, right?

&quot;Outlawing guns&quot; simply says that you would be forbidding people to own them.  But that doesn't *actually* remove them from the hands of criminals or anyone else.  Guns can't be &quot;unmade&quot; anymore than, say, nuclear weapons can be unmade. (*GASP* Did I just reference that other Cloning thread?

<br>
As long as guns or the knowledge of guns exists in the worlds, people will find ways to own and use them.  This is true for criminals and is true for you and I.  If it's impossible to totally erase guns (and the tremendous advantage they give in violent confrontations) from the world, then the only reasonable option for those who wish to protect themselves is to also have guns.  <br>

The point isn't that the *current* Canadian or American governments might suppress anything you say.  The point is that some future government might try to, for whatever reasons.  Ultimately, the time might come where Canadians or Americans might have to fight their governments.  And if the citizens don't have guns, it's going to be a much harder fight.<br>

This is a meaningless statistic if the UN and I differ on the criteria for what makes a country &quot;best to live in&quot; (and we do).  Canadians work under a staggering taxload to pay for all of the social programs that the government funds.  I would consider that a huge strike against Canada.  Canada continues to redistribute the most federal funds to a province that consistently holds the rest of the country hostage by threatening to secede.  These things, among others, put Canada much further down the list of desirable countries to live in on my scale.  So only if I share the same point of view as the UN is this statistic at all meaningful.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Brahma Atman

There's a difference between outlawing guns, and controlling them. Eamin's said that in an ideal world, there would be no firearms. He's also been pragmatic and said that since that's unlikely to happen, he wants it to be damned hard to get a gun. I agree with him completely on that point.

I'm glad that you study the martial arts, Aurianne.  But if I'm standing 10 feet away from you and I'm pointing a gun at you, would any of your martial arts training be able to save you from my bullet?  I'm honestly curious if you know any techniques, since you might study some funky stuff that I'm simply not aware of.  Maybe you could fill me in on how your instructors teach you to win fights against people with guns?  In this hypothetical confrontation, the gun-wielder is at least 10 feet away.  Might as well make the gun-wielder smart enough to understand that a gun's primary advantage is range.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Just because I own a gun doesn't mean I want to solve all of my problems with it.  Just because I own a gun doesn't mean I will use it to perform a crime.  I agree that violence should be the last resort in conflict resolution.  But to suggest that violence *isn't* a way to resolve conflicts is naive.  <br>
<br>
As for &quot;hiding behind guns&quot; because I'm &quot;afraid to actually confront those who accost [me]&quot;, that sounds very much like a &quot;fight like a man&quot; argument.  Let's say that I'm not trained in martial arts, but I do carry a handgun with me.  If I'm assaulted, I should put the handgun on the ground and fight with my bare hands because I should &quot;actually confront&quot; them?  What does &quot;actually confront&quot; mean?<br>
<br>
I have tons of family in Ottawa, Aurianne, and I lived there for nearly six years.  I'm a dual American-Canadian citizen.  My parents are Canadian.

<br>
I know that if I were a panicked individual, or a criminal, pointing a gun at you and I saw you reaching for a gun in your pocket, I'd shoot. Without even thinking, I'd put a bullet in your head if I thought for a second that you were going to point a gun at me. That's the whole point I'm trying to get across to you: putting a gun in your hand makes you feel falsely confident.<br>
<br>
As for the range on a gun? Capitulate. They demand your wallet, so give it to them. I have defense techniques for disarming people with guns, but I can't control the Force and disarm them from a distance. If I absolutely feared my life, I'd try to get them to trust me enough to get close enough for me to disarm. But I wouldn't even worry about that, because there's never more than $20 in my wallet: I do all of my transactions through my Mastercard or Interac. I carry a cell phone, and can have both cards cancelled within 2 minutes of their being stolen (yes, I remember my M/C number and expiration). My life is worth a hell of a lot more to me than $20.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes. It is a &quot;fight like a man&quot; argument. Everybody should go through self defense training, at the very least. Having acquired high level belts in Jiu Jitsu and Tae Kwon Do, I feel far more confident in my own abilities than I did before I started, and have learned a great deal about how to deal with situations where I'm accosted. The point, however, is that you shouldn't fight at all, if you can avoid it. One of the first lessons any true Sensei of martial arts will teach you is that the martial arts are for use only when you have no other choice. Likewise, if you're mugged at gunpoint, you should let it happen. If you feel overconfident because you have a gun in your hand, you are more likely to attempt to bring down your assailant, and if you're at the distance you propose, he's quite likely to see what you're doing and shoot first.<br>
<br>
<br>
You seem to have missed the fundamental point of the 2nd paragraph that you've quoted, just as you all have missed my fundamental argument against firearms. So let me quote it for you.<br>

The case of a mugging is not really the best one to illustrate why gun-ownership advocates feel that it's important that people own guns.  It might seem far-fetched to you, Aurianne, but the whold &quot;defend myself against the government&quot; thing is really a primary motivation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<br>
Why can't that self-defense training be with a gun?  Let's say that I spend 5 years learning how to shoot a gun and how to use a gun in situations where I'm accosted?  To go back to our earlier mugging example, you mentioned that you have techniques for disarming an attacker if you can get close enough.  If I've trained in defensive gun use for 5 years, it's likely that I've learned ways to draw and use my gun in sneaky ways that an attacker won't expect.  Let's assume that such defensive gun techniques exist.  Would you deny responsible citizens the right to choose that form of self-defense?  Or does everyone have to make the same self-defense choices that you make?<br>

I assume that you don't feel overconfident in dangerous situations because you've trained yourself on how to handle them.  If I take 5 years of gun training, it's reasonable to assume that I will also avoid overconfidence in similar situations.<br>
<br>
If someone untrained in firearms use is overconfident in a dangerous situation and makes a mistake, it's exactly the same as someone who is untrained in hand-to-hand techniques making a similar mistake of overconfidence.  <br>
<br>
Even if a person *is* overconfident because they carry a gun without the proper training, any mistake they make will be their responsibility.  It goes back to this simple idea: just because someone is going to make an idiotic mistake doesn't mean that I will.  It is unfair to restrict me because of something someone else might do.  As I said in another thread, if someone use their car to kill someone they don't like, should you and I lose the right to drive?<br>

&quot;The Supreme Court in Canada will rule on whether a Christian college that disapproves of homosexuality may train teachers for Canadian public schools.<br>
<br>
The case involves Trinity Western University (TWU) and the British Columbia College of Teachers (BCCT) in 1996 and may set a historic precedent concerning religious freedoms in Canada.<br>
<br>
The teacher-training program at TWU, a Christian school 20 miles east of Vancouver, was first denied full accreditation by BCCT in 1996. BCCT said TWU's stance that homosexuality is a sin amounted to discriminatory practice. BCCT warned that even though the program met all academic qualifications, teachers trained at TWU might discriminate against homosexual students.<br>
<br>
In September 1997, the British Columbia Supreme Court ordered BCCT to approve TWU's application for accreditation. BCCT appealed, and in 1998 the British Columbia Court of Appeals found again that BCCT's decisions to deny TWU accreditation &quot;reflect an error in law and are factually and patently unreasonable.&quot;<br>
<br>
Guy S. Saffold, TWU executive vice president, says the Supreme Court ruling holds a great deal of significance for religious institutions in North America. &quot;This case is about Christian people's religious right to maintain their beliefs and not be excluded because of them,&quot; Saffold says.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you can't train teachers because you disapprove of homosexuality, can you be a teacher if you disapprove of homosexuality? Can you be a doctor or a lawyer or a judge?&quot; TWU expects a hearing date in the fall of 2000 or early 2001.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bottom line...yes there is free speech in Canada as long as your views are in line with the governments.  Screw you if yours are not in line with the governments.  You will be investigated, discredited, discriminated against by the government, etc.  because you hold different views.  Doesnt sound like diversity or openmindedness to me.<br>

Read the above two quotes from the Charter of Rights and Freedoms again. The bottom line is, in fact, that free speech in Canada is guaranteed, as long as your free speech does not infringe on the rights of other individuals.<br>

<br>
this person decided  that guns are bad because guns kill people and children<br>
<br>
my only response was people killed people, adn lots of things kill children, esp irresponible adults, its sad but its not an impliments fualt, its the adult's fault<br>
<br>
and as to why would i want a concealable weapon? to protect my family and myself<br>
<br>
just because some one would like to cary a gun, doesn't mean they like to advertise it<br>
<br>
why would i want an assalt rifle or other such weaponry?<br>
its one of those CYA things...what if  we are forced to defend ourselves because of extenuating circumstances? <p>Illegal javascript event tags or url parameters detected.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utorcerarcana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torcer Arcana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/12/02 3:44:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1>  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;Well, leaving aside the fact that it's in the CONSTITUTION,</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
     When you state that it is &quot;in the Constitution&quot; you are ignoring the fact that the wording of the Second Amendment is ambiguous, at best.  To say that the wording of the 2nd Am provides a right to bear arms is a legal conclsuion, and once again, such a legal conclusion is the job of the Supreme Court.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> we can't, any more than you can provide us with precedent saying you have a right to drink your coffee the way you like. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
     The Coffee example is irrelevant.  There is no Constitutional right to &quot;drink coffee,&quot; in fact Congress has the power to regulate Coffee under the commerce clause.  There is no real room for SC interepretation, because there is specific provision addressing Coffee.  In the case of the 2nd Am, there IS ambiguity regarding firearms.  If the precedent is there then you could provide it.  If it were there, I would not be arguing with you.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The SC has refused to hear any 2nd amendment cases in the last, oh, 80 years I think it is.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
   Ther fact that the SC has not exercised Cert and taken a 2nd Am case in 80 years indicates that it feels no real need to revisit this issue and will allow the lower court rulings to stand.  The SC exercises WIDE discretion in the case is grants Cert for and must not feel this is a pressing issue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Any ruling they made would EITHER require overturning the 2nd Amendment,</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The Court can't &quot;overturn&quot; an Amendment, it can only overturn legislation as violating a provision of the Con.  Amendments may only be repealed by 2/3 of the States.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> OR thousands of laws would be declared unconstitutional overnight.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If the Court decides that there is a 2nd Am right to bear arms, it won't have any problem overturning thousands of pieces of legislation.  At least it had no such problems in Brown and Roe. <p>Torcer Arcana - 60 Sorcerer - Brothers of Darkness - The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utorcerarcana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torcer Arcana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/12/02 3:51:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=80>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Are you trying to tell me that if guns weren allowed in airports, they'd still have used box cutters? /bonk Torcer</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

      Here is my real objection to the 9/11 example.  In the wake of 9/11 most Americans asked themselves - &quot;How can I help?&quot;  However, some interest groups, most noteably the Gun Lobby and the Anti-Drug lobby, asked themselves - &quot;How can I use the murder of 3,000 innocent Americans to further my own political agenda.&quot;  <br>
<br>
      When I see 9/11 used to promote a political agenda, any political agenda, I find it distasteful, offensive and insulting to the thousands of victims whose blood is being used to further these organizations political goals.  The Gun lobby is not the only group to do this, but I believe the previous statement is such a use of 9/11.  Americans realize that 9/11 has nothing to do with the Gun Control debate, so I say to both sides in the issue, don't try to make 9/11 about something its not. <p>Torcer Arcana - 60 Sorcerer - Brothers of Darkness -
