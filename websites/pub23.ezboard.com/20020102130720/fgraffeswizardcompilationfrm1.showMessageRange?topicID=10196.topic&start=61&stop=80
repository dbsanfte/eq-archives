I remember hitting 50 and going to Sebilis and spending HOURS LFG and getting nothing.  After two weeks of not a single group, I gave up and headed off to the boring grind of quadding raptors.  At least it was good xp.<br>
<br>
A month or two later, I dropped by Seb just to give it a shot again.  Raptors drop squat and I really needed a break.   A friend was in the zone and surprise, someone had just bailed.  I had a group!  Woo hoo!  I rush on down to the group and we grind for a couple hours.  During that time, in a group of 6, I consistently did 33% of the damage of the mob. I was only 16% of the group.  With our pull rate, I was able to more or less maintain this rate.  If that's not carrying my weight, I don't know what is.  Oh, and I evac'd the grp when we were done too and did a TL or two.<br>
<br>
I don't know if this is really the case, but I've long though that the main reason we aren't desired in groups is we lack buffs.  People, for the most part, can only look at things from their class' perspective.  Buff me and I'll be more powerful.  So a druid or shaman is viewed as superior to a wizard.  It's wrong and myopic and selfish to see it this way, but it does seem to be the case.<br>
<br>
The picture does change at high levels, though.  I'm 60 now and exceptionally well equipped after dozens of North ToV raids.  I was grouping in Fungus grove the other night.  We had a tank, a rogue, a shammy, a cleric, myself and some other class I can't recall.  We were dropping mushrooms at a pretty fast rate.  After some experiementation, I discovered that if I cast just ONE sunstrike on the mob, that I couldn't QUITE recover the mana spent on it by the time I was casting on the next.  Ice Spear seemed to be where I broke even.  1200hp a mob.  I knew at that point that I wasn't carrying my weight there. <br>
<br>
Sure, a tank needs a cleric or healer, but with a small amount of mana, they're a new tank again (hp wise) and they keep going and going and going.  Us casters know that mana is a whole different thing.  There is no CH for mana restoration.  C2 doesn't really come close.  Sure, our spells do more damage in 7 seconds than any tank can, but I've seen screenshots of a Rogue outdamaging me in those 7 seconds.  And they CAN get the CH to restore them to 100%.<br>
<br>
Verant has never understood casters and is incredibly afraid of them because you fear the unknown.  You'd think after 3 years they'd have a clue about it, but no.<br>
<br>
However, in most situations, the wizard is a very efficient group member, especially if you have a bard or chanter to boost their mana regen.  And then there's AoE groups...<br>
<br>
So, no, we don't totally kick ass everywhere, but then would that be fair?  While I didn't carry my weight in Fungus Grove, I can still do things at 60 to get xp.  I can snare when there's no druid or ranger around.  I can provide travel as well.  All that does add to the usefulness, as long as your damage output is still acceptable.  Oh, and when the entire party went LD except the cleric, shammie and I, guess who saved their bacon?  8 )<br>
<br>
We do ok.  Help a wiz out, they'll remember and return the favor, be it a mob you need to kill for a quest, help on your epic, or an emergency TL for whatever.<br>

Melees have rouges, but what do casters have as the equivilent?<br>
<br>
I'd always regarded wizzies as the hard class to play that did a ton of damage.  Even Verant said something of this nature, calling us the &quot;heavy artillery&quot; in the game.  Whilst it is true we can burn something down faster than anyone else, that doesn't fit the definition of artillery.  Artillery in real life, typically, takes a long time to prepare, takes skill in control and aim, and is vulnerable due to lack of movement.  I don't see wizards as that at all.<br>
<br>
There is no pure damage caster (not including pets, only the casters themselves).  We're the closest there is to a pure magical damage caster, and we can't sustain it.  This vision has drifted from what people generally see wizards as, IMO.  It seems that we should get long casting, very high damage spells, but instead we're more of a utility class than we should be, IMO.  And we're not even specialized at that.  Being a taxi is the only thing we do that is really uniquely ours, and druids have a lot of that ability (IE: no treehugger rings in Luclin [yeah I know ours don't work -- you get the idea], but they can port to common places and evac).<br>
<br>
It just begs the question: why no pure magic damage caster?<br>

<br>
Well, here's the core reason so many Wizards and others have an uneasy feeling about the class.  Wizards were designed by Verant to be a cannon that ports around, that's the concept of the class.  Other stuff was built around this, and the sight spells slapped on at the last minute with a 'seekers of knowledge' tag thrown on just to make it seem like a concept.<br>
<br>
Wizards are meant to be the front line casters, not support, not make others better, but to help make the monsters die.  Like the melee guys, the class was meant to be the artillery, the part of the strike force that makes a monster fall down rather than making the strike force function well.  But Verant, probably due to the power of wizards in beta, seems to have been frightened by the spectre of an overpowered class, and has always worked on the assumption that any change to Wizards that makes them more potent will ruin the game.<br>
<br>
So there's not just a few places, times, and opponents that will leave you with this feeling... that you aren't pulling your weight.  This doesn't come up for a tank, because as long as they are standing and beating the thing, they are doing their job.  They don't have a fuel tank, they keep rolling as long as they are alive.  When you have a fuel tank and put your damage out in slower, more potent bursts, when those bursts aren't working then you feel like you aren't doing your job.<br>
<br>
That feeling is shared by a lot of people.  The rise of Rogues in offensive power along with the melee gear poured out of the expansions has made an alternative to Wizards that seems pretty viable, you get the offense without as many drawbacks, plus a few bennies on the side (pick locks, etc).  Whether this opinion is justified or not has been discussed quite a bit, but the general opinion is that for many if not most levels, wizards just don't bring the bang to your group other classes do.<br>
<br>
The bottom line, though, is whether you play this game to max your efficiency and experience gain (to what end I'm not sure, its not a race) or to enjoy yourself with friends.  Verant has contributed to this hardcore bloodthirsty view, I believe, by making encounters increasingly require the most efficent, most lean, most effective team you can gather.  They did it to try to make things 'challenging' in the same way a video game increasingly becomes more difficult and more and more until you blew your quarter and have to stuff another in.  Since EQ has little to it, really, other than killing various different shaped things, the only challenge Verant produces is making the killing of these things increasingly difficult and costly to your group.  That's why Absor was salivating at the prospect of encounters that require over 50 people to win.  Thankfully in these kinds of encounters, wizards tend to have an edge, in that we have certain spells to make us useful.  Whether that will hold true in Luclin remains to be seen, its not always true in the previous expansions (monsters unbaneable).<br>
<br>
General good will and positive thoughts toward Wizards can't hurt, but the nature of the game, in my opinion, is weighed against this.  Unless Wizards truly ARE the kill machines that people look for, they won't really ever make that grade in the really lean, mean groups meaning to grind out xps fast and deadly.  These are the groups that hate the thought of one more person to share xps with because on their spreadsheet they have reached optimal efficiency as is.<br>
<br>
What CAN be effected is the rest of the player base, who without analyzing things sees Joe Level-50-in-2-days doesn't like x class, so they figure &quot;hell, that guy must know something&quot; and go along with them.  These people can learn that Wizards don't HURT a group, and since a good Wizard is probably one of the top players in the game, will actually HELP the group.<br>
<br>
Face it, this isn't a class that you keep playing unless you are uniquely driven.  Casual players fall by the wayside, Ebayed Wizards end up rotting on a plane somewhere while their owner tries to sell the non no drop stuff.  Its a hard class to play.  Some take terrific pride in that, so be it.  This does have a culling effect, however, and it tends to weed out the ones who run off to an easier class to level.<br>
<br>
I've never argued that Wizards need to be fixed because they can't get groups - I find that argument to be without any real merit for a wide variety of reasons.  What I've always wanted was for the class to reach the potential that Verant glimpsed but constantly shied away from.  Look at Bards, at Clerics, these are classes that are solid from level 1-60, with a place in the game at all levels, a great concept, and a well-executed plan.  The design is good, the ideas are interesting, they are just well-done.  Wizards had a good concept, a solid design, but they were gutted in Beta and the patched up job looks like a crazy quilt.<br>
<br>
Verant knows damn well the class isn't quite right, but the fixes they put on it are like adding turn signals to a blender.  Technically they can be useful, but that's not what the class is about.  That's why we got more ports, snares, and damage shields.  The CORE of the class has been almost totally avoided in terms of work, because making the class lean and efficient makes things die fast, very fast.  We've seen how much Verant likes that idea in the past.  They created a class that doesn't fit their core concept for the game, and since they can't just delete it, they've danced around it for 3 years with side issues and wierd ideas.<br>
<br>
What we finally come down to is this: Wizards aren't a lousy class, they aren't broken, and they don't suck.  They add to almost any group at any level, which is more than you can say for some other classes in the game.  And at least we get better post 50 (to what proper degree and consistency we can all discuss forever), and trust me many classes just don't.  Our Cleric's perspective isn't exactly accurate, but his heart is in the right place.  Why not add a wizard to your group?  What's the worst that could happen, you don't get level 51 by tuesday?  Whats the damn rush? <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukaziqueal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaziqueal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/15/01 7:21:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Group a Wizard for Crying out Loud (Cleric's perspective</span><hr size=1> I usually don't agree with you, grim, but that was a pretty good post and right on the money. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usanlear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sanlear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/15/01 7:25:07 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.fortunecity.com/roswell/price/12/ciruelo/ciruelo07.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Group a Wizard for Crying out Loud (Cleric's perspective</span><hr size=1> Well said (er...written) Grimstaff.

We need to be HANDS DOWN the best damage dealers in pick-up groups. I don't mean that we can kill things in two hits, that would be horribly overpowered and I think that's what Verant is trying to stay away from.<br>
What I want is for Wizzies to have the BEST damage per second in multiple battles. I think maybe huge, clunky nukes would serve this purpose, only with Draught-style mana efficiency and quad-Lure style casting times. This way, the Wizard is doing something very useful to the group by dealing out huge damage amounts, but Wizzies couldn't use a 24-second nuke while soloing (/imagines himself trying to solo a frost giant with this). This would prevent Wizzies from abusing their power for personal benefit.<br>
I'd make up mana/casting time/damage stats for my new &quot;several thousand ton meteor spell,&quot; but I don't have enough experience in this field.<br>
To summarize:<br>
We need Bane-style damage, Draught-style mana efficiency, and Robe-style casting times. <p>Eamin Whitefalcon <BR> Erudite Wizard <BR> Priest of Solusek Ro <BR> "My ego will smother your ego in its cradle"--Eamin <BR> http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=41988</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/15/01 9:26:41 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Group a Wizard for Crying out Loud (Cleric's perspective</span><hr size=1> First of all, very nice post Grimstaff, except that I might argue that some other non-wizard classes, maybe even clerics as you mentioned, are actually the classes that are a bit out of alignment.<br>
<br>
Jrathek,<br>
<br>
I don't quite agree with the way you've put some things.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It kinda makes me wonder -- If you look at any caster class, not a single class can really be called the damage class. Melees have rogues, but what do casters have as the equivilent?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Well, first of all, monks and rogues sort of share the Melee damage category.  Both have a small array of supporting abilities(Sneak/hide/poison, feign/mend).<br>
<br>
Second, I look at the four int casters and I see that three are readily capable damage dealers.  The Wizard, the Magician, and the Necromancer.  The Necromancer's ability to do damage is a bit specialized, and the necro has lots of other nifty tricks to pull that don't do any damage directly, so I would rule out Necromancers as a damage dealing class.  So that leaves Wizards and Mages.<br>
<br>
Both these classes seem clearly designed to be able to dish out damage.  <br>
<br>
Magicians have three primary sources of damage:  Pets, Damage shields, and Direct Damage.  Their pets and damage shields are top of the line, and thier Direct Damage is respectable, but doesn't appear to be the forte of the class.  They have less variety of direct damage(virtually no target AE's, a few rains and PBAE's here and there, and a fairly decent array of single target nukes).   Magicians seem to be the hybrid pure damage dealer.  Whatever kind of pure damage the situation calls for, the mage will be able to provide some, and eventually, it should add up to a solid chunk of a groups overall output.  At high levels, this role begins to change somewhat, as two particular summoning spells become more valuable(CoH and Mod Rod.. I've heard great things about the new mod rod, I need to get 56 and find the spell hehe), and their debuff spell becomes more important.  But Mages are still a class loaded with damage dealing potential and little else.  <br>
<br>
Wizards, on the other hand <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the pure magical damage dealing class.  Compared to other int. casters, even magicians, wizard utility is minimal at best.  Spells like root, stun, and snare round out the class and are much like the secondary abilities of the rogue and the monk because face it, wizards would be damn frustrating to play without those caster basics.  Wizards basically have two things to do:  Nuke and Port.  Look at the wizard spell list..  It is completely loaded with damage spells.  There are single target nukes of varying flavors and a healthy number of AE's, as Rains, PB, or targetable.  A couple spells are there just to let you nuke more, like harvest and concussion.  When it comes to combat, if you aren't called upon to snare, all a wizard does, basically, is deal magical damage and save mana for evac.<br>
<br>
I never really realized it until lately that I've looked at some of my casting logs, but as a magician I spend an awful large amount of mana on spells <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> other</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than nukes.  In a recent but short(45 minute) trip to the hole I spent about 60% of my mana on nukes, the rest went to damage shields, pets, Malosi and one cast of Call of the Hero.  When I look at a standard wizard spell summary, it's 2 to 5 different nukes, harvest, and concussion unless the wiz is snaring.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think you're wrong that there are no damage dealing casters, it's wizzies and mages.  And for pure damage, it's wizards with a comfortable, but not necessarily spectacular, lead.  Wizards are maybe not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> quite</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as singularly focused on damage as rogues and monks are, but they're not really that far off, especially when compared with other int casters.<br>
<br>
<br>
You make good points that wizards aren't really much like heavy artillery.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Artillery in real life, typically, takes a long time to prepare, takes skill in control and aim, and is vulnerable due to lack of movement. I don't see wizards as that at all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->But I don't quite agree with all of it.  I think that wizards take awhile to prepare(meditation), and take skill to control and aim(choosing appropriate targets and timing to avoid aggro).  Unlike heavy artillery, Wizards are vulnerable due mostly to lack of armored protection, which is a point you made.  <br>
<br>
I think of wizards as something like a bomber.  A mobile but vulnerable target with the power to take out important targets while others protect.  Have you ever played X-wing or TIE fighter?  Often, bombing missions will have the vulnerable bombers destroy the primary target, while the tanks and fighters keep the way clear.  <br>
<br>
Bombers = Y-wings, B-Wings (Wizards, Mages)<br>
Fighters = X-Wings, A-Wings (Rangers, Rogues, Monks)<br>
Tanks = Cruisers, etc. (Warrior/Cleric)<br>
<br>
Of course, wizards can double as Shuttles too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We're the closest there is to a pure magical damage caster, and we can't sustain it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'm not quite sure what you're getting at here.  Of course you can sustain damage.  It's not like you're issued a tank of mana when you log on and that's how much you get to use for the night.  A wizard can sustain damage depending on his mana regeneration rate.  Whether the rate of dealing damage is high enough is debatable, but it is definitely sustainable, should you choose it to be.  But then, you can also control the amount of damage you do over a specific period of time.  Sometimes you nuke harder, sometimes you lay off, and very often this kind of thing can save a group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This vision has drifted from what people generally see wizards as, IMO.

However, I do think it would be cool to have like, a 25 second mega blast with high damage and a good ratio.  But if you think of wizards as the bomber rather than the stationary artillery, such an ability isn't really necessary, although it could fit.  I really don't think wizards have too much utility..  One <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> can</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> take the view that the utility is a downside, but I prefer to think of the utility a wizard has(other than teleports) as merely options that can spice up the class, should a wizard choose to use them.  A wizard that isn't needed for snare, root, or stun can put 100% of his resources towards dealing damage.  What other caster does that consistantly?  A mage is the only one that comes close.<br>

<br>
My point was that I don't feel like there is anything similar to what Eamin is talking about.  Everyone has some form of utility or another.  And although Wizzies have special emphasis on nuking compared to anything else we do, we're still in the background.  We're backup, not on the front lines.  We're still not efficient.  I think this thread pretty much proves that.<br>
<br>
That's also why I said pure magical caster.  I don't consider pets &quot;pure.&quot;<br>
<br>
I mean mana =&gt; damage<br>
<br>
Not mana =&gt; pet / shield =&gt; damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Anyway, I think you're wrong that there are no damage dealing casters&quot;<br>
<br>
There are damage dealing casters.  Sorry if I wasn't clear enough on the following: Wizards are pure magical casters, but there isn't much UMPH behind that.  We're great tactical backup, and we have utilities to help out, which is awesome.  But it just isn't what I see a wizzie as: Frontlines howitzer, not backup bomber.<br>
<br>
<br>
And durnit, I completely goofed that artillery analogy.  I'm sowwy =(  I was refering specifically to damage, and &quot;taking time to prepare,&quot; which I see as spell casting time (and yes, medding, too! =) ) and I completely botched that sentence.<br>
<br>
BTW: TIE Fighter was my first game.  I just bought the Windows version of it for $9.99, and just beat it again. =P  X-Wing, XvT, Rebel Assault, and many many more are all under my belt. =)<br>
<br>
And I like your bomber analogy.  That's the way it IS.  And the more I think about it, the more comfortable I am with the way wizzies are now, so long as people would be nicer and let us into groups more often -- see earlier reply of mine.<br>
<br>
I'm just pointing out that Wizards aren't what Verant made them out to be at the beginning, nor the imagine I've ordained from every fantasy book, movie and game I've ever been exposed to.<br>
<br>
<br>
I said:  &quot;We're the closest there is to a pure magical damage caster, and we can't sustain it.&quot;<br>
You replied:<br>
&quot;I'm not quite sure what you're getting at here. Of course you can sustain damage.&quot;<br>
<br>
I mean we cannot sustain constant damage in the amount of a damage orientated melee player.  There are many logs to back that up, so I understand.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry about all the confusion, I apparently do not know how to write an organized post.  My mind is very random -- I guess I have A.D.D. =P<br>
<br>
My post:<br>
&quot;This vision has drifted from what people generally see wizards as, IMO.&quot;<br>
<br>
Insert clarification: It seems that we are not the damage masters as many think we should be.<br>
<br>
Continue:<br>
&quot;It seems that we should get long casting, very high damage spells, but instead we're more of a utility class than we should be, IMO.&quot;<br>
<br>
Insert elaboration:<br>
We're more utility in that we're &quot;backup,&quot; we don't sit on the front lines, we stand back and take out certain targets when needed.<br>
<br>
Continue:<br>
&quot;And we're not even specialized at that.&quot;<br>

Insert clarification:<br>
&quot;Many other classes have DDs and AEs similar to ours.&quot;<br>

<br>
I think, in some ways, the desirablity of classes in xp groups are memes (contagious ideas).  And I think it differs from server to server and from level cohort to level cohort (20's vs 40's vs' 50's etc).  <br>
<br>
On my server, at my level range, wizards are pretty much always welcome -- for all the reasons you mentioned.  <br>
<br>
Bottom line, I guess it's a matter of education and experience.  Lots of uninformed players never give wizards a chance, and so miss out on good wizard xp.  <br>
<br>
For those wizards who are having trouble finding xp groups, I just recommend you cultivate a small circle of people who are educated to our value, and stick with them.  <br>

The same holds true for melee and haste. What does this mean for a group? It means that enchanters, 90% of the time, will have one of those 6 group slots locked down. That leaves 5 remaining. You need healing and you need it to be efficient, that means slot#2 is locked down by a cleric 90% of the time. 4 slots left and we need someone to absorb that damage efficiently. Enter the warrior who locks down slot #3 90% of the time.<br>
<br>
What does that mean? 3 classes are used by players as the bare basic bones of the large majority of exp groups, leaving the other 12 of us to fight for the remaining 3 slots. <br>
<br>
Let's examine this skeletal group and see what it brings to the table:<br>
You have a player that can hold aggro while taking efficient damage while dealing good damage himself. You are able to haste that player, slow down the damage he takes, and up the mana regen of his cleric who has the groups heals locked down rather nicely. What do we need now? We need snare and damage. Who's the highest damage dealer that we could get for this group? Rogues, followed now by monks. We still need snare, what class would best fit this role and still add to the groups efficiency? Hmm hard call, you now have about 4-5 classes fighting for this one spot.<br>
<br>
The Ideal group that I would take to sebilis if I were an enchanter.<br>
1. me(enchanter)*I'm not really an enchanter, but let's pretend*<br>
2.cleric<br>
3.rogue<br>
4.rogue<br>
5.rogue<br>
6. shadowknight to tank/snare/out-taunt the rogues<br>
<br>
Look at it anyway you like, but the fact remains that some classes in this game are heavily favoured by verant for the exp game, and it's not our own lack of power that keeps us from groups, but rather it is the sheer overpowering of these 3 main classes for an aspect of the game that we are all forced to deal with... the exp grind. 3 of the 15 classes effectively lock down, far more efficiently than any others, 70% of what is required to advance in this game by the large majority of its content. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=10196.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=10196.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=10196.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=10196.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=10196.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=10196.topic&start=121&stop=122>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=10879.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=10840.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=10196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=10196.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10196.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10196.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Spell Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Faction Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Quest Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Item Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
