<br>
After the recent patch and the upping of MR of some mobs, my guild is at a wall. Given Kunark and the fact that we are predominantly Asian so play at off peak hours, we always kept the guild solid at being able to field between 24-30 level 58+ players and could take on any challenge. We killed Trak with 17. We have done as much as possible with as few as possible for the last 2 years and have a very tight group even though we have had the normal flow of members as people drop off.<br>
<br>
here is the problem. With Velious, we have to be able to field 40+ minimum for most ubermobs. With 2 active asian &quot;uberguilds&quot; that don't particularly get along (japanese vs chinese) there are not enough available pool of 58+ players to recruit to make up the difference. Add to that we have been playing with the same people for almost 2 years and throwing another &quot;guild size recruit class&quot; in the mix would destroy alot of the skill we have developed working together. To increase our average turnout by 15 people we would have to recruit at least 30 level 58+ people and then gear them out.<br>
<br>
It makes me mad that we have been forced after 2 years to practically double our size for the sake of progression. We have been able to take down the mobs that 30ish people can take like Zand, Kland, Velk, and almost Vindicator, Wuoshi etc but we will never be able to take the named in TOV, Sleepers, get to PoM, Dain, Tormax, Statue, Yelniak etc. <br>
<br>
We have hit a wall. I can already start feeling our once strong guild slipping away as people log on less and less knowing we can't &quot;progress&quot;. I know people will say &quot;just join a bigger guild&quot; or &quot;recruit more people&quot; or &quot;team up with other guilds&quot; but believe me when I say that at our playtime there are only 700 people on and our guild and the other Asian guild make up about 80 of the level 60s on at that time if all were to log on at the same time. There just isnt a pool for us.<br>
<br>
The only reason rant is so that there is some trace of &quot;what went wrong&quot; as I slowly ween myself off EQ. I always knew this time would come I guess, I just never figured what the reason why would be.<br>
<br>
Now Inny and CT which were possible for us (although damn tough) pre-patch have now been taken off our list of mobs we can realistically do. I thought there was hope when they said they were lowering the resistances of mobs to make all casters more effective and were going to try to keep encounters tuned to 30-35ish people. Then the server filters went in and the new patch have pretty much spelled the end of my EQ career.  <br>
<br>
Sigh.<br>

<br>
I admit that it is challenge to get 40 or more 60sh and geared people to same encounter and to perform as solid unit, but especially for off-peak players... it can be an obstacle instead of challenge. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If only their engine supported dynamic encounters... if you attack a mob00 with 18 peeps, it is tough fight for them but if you attack with 36 peeps, it dynamically adjusts and is still fight. /sigh that's just a far fetched wish.<br>
<br>
I can fully understand you Fasty, being former off-peak player myself. I remember times when Naggy was up and not enough 50sh people to even try to tackle him... seems like cycle is repeating itself for off-peakers. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The whole game is about grouping, a 6 person group banded together to have fun and adventure.  Then as time goes on you find there are more and more places you just can't do it with 6 people.  And as you go up levels there are fewer and fewer places you can do it with a regular group.  This change from the usual RPG party to a horde of army-like proportions willing to die repeatedly to achieve a goal is a real mistake on Verant's part.<br>
<br>
I can see having a FEW encounters like that... taking on a 'god' or a dragon.  But they should be a very tiny minority of encounters. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg" ></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/5/01 5:52:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Wall for groups of 30ish level 60s- Fasty's Twilight</span><hr size=1> Agreed, I play from Europe, and on a PvP server (that's the one at the top of the server list with noone playing on it) and the guild I am in, which is one of the 'high' level guilds, only musters about 20 people for 'raid' occasions.<br>
<br>
We have a selective recruitment policy, and we have the same problem. Some people are disgusted with the game since we can't 'progress' and that we refuse to recruit just anyone to fill in the gaps in our classes. (ie: we only have a  lvl 55+ mage since a few weeks)<br>
<br>
I'd be interested in hearing your tactics to take out Trakanon with 17 people, since that's about the number of people we can get together hehe, or knowing what sort of stuff you try to do with about 20 ppl.<br>
<br>
We have: <br>
<br>
60 ENC, 58 ENC<br>
56 MAG<br>
55 NEC<br>
60 WIZ<br>
<br>
60 MNK (epic)<br>
2x 60 ROG (epics)<br>
58 RNG (epic)<br>
2x 60 SK (1 epic) 57 SK<br>
55 WAR<br>
56 BRD<br>

We did the same thing we always did. Buffed up resists, sent in the tanks then sent in the nukes. Had 3 60 wizys there that could land sunstrike for full. Also left one mudman up so our 60 chanter could dictate it and send it in. Dictate last 48 seconds and trak never lasts that long.<br>
<br>
We did Klandiclar with 29 but it was tough and everyone was pretty much 60. Velk with 30 is possible but only with enough rogues and bane enabled wizzys (need at least one but preferably 2) The one thing that lets us be even reasonably successful on velious mobs is that we can field 6-7 level 58+ clerics and 5 or so level 60 warriors and 2-3 rogues/monks. Most of the wizzys play alts for those with the exception of bane enabled ones on a baneable mob. (I play a 56 cleric)<br>

Hope this helps,<br>

<br>
We've always cleared Tola after trak dies, he has 2 juggers near him, so I assume if you dictate a jug the rest will aggro and cause problems. Or are there some juggers a little further in, I can't remember well.<br>
<br>
I've always used lures, but does sunstrike land for full even if trak is not debuffed, or do you need malosi etc and druid fire debuff thing?<br>
<br>

But lately i've had the same thoughts, same lack of motivation and i am backing off from EQ.<br>
<br>
More recruitement means more stress, more raids to gear them out and for the current members, and more raids and stress means i wont be logging on as much. Not because of the raids, but because of the hassle of being 1 person in 50 and being stressed for 3 hrs while a raid is organised, executed while 2 other guilds are racing for the same mob. And then doing the same shit day after day by racing to yet another uber mob, for some stupid warrior weapon or plate armour item.<br>
<br>
EQ's high end game has pretty much driven me to lay off eq more and i can see in the short term me leaving the game, probably never to return. you either leave eq totally, or not at all because its that addictive it just sucks you in and wont let go. Playing a support class (ie, not a chanter, cleric or warrior, because those are the core classes) just holds less interest for me now that i am shuffled more and more into less important groups.<br>
<br>
If you do logon to Inny, give me a tell Fasty if you see me online. Havent noticed you on for a while, and now i've found this post it pretty much explains why.<br>

I definitely agree with her.. it just should not be necessary to coordinate 50 people to do ANYTHING in a game like this. This is supposed to be fun.<br>
<br>
If I enjoyed babysitting or office managent I would do that and get paid for it.<br>
<br>
I will be sure to ask the pointed question of any new game that comes out.. do they envision 50+ person encounters as being de riguer? If so I opt out. I won't do this again.<br>
