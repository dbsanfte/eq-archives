<br>
<br>
Well we did pretty well loot wise as far as the plane was concerened. We had a messy break in, the first an almost whipeout and the CR did whipeout, but we did recover and carry on. We were in the plane for about 12 hours.<br>
We did attempt to take out Maestro and almost had him. Do to some fast mez work by Niema, Mennian was able to log out for the ensuing CR.<br>

All in all not a bad raid. Our goal in the future is to be able to break the plane in 5 to 7 hours and then hit the second floor.<br>
<br>
Addendum<br>
A few people tho thank that helped out Like Troopers<br>
<br>
Bamil dealt with most of the group creation past the first 2 groups. He also took a sacrificial death to help with the CR and got nothing out of the raid loot wise. As always an inspiration of what a great player is.<br>
<br>
Niema and I spent most of the day on the phone talking strategy and tactics for hate and pulls, she taught me one hell of a lot about what can and can not be mezed easily and kept me sane since I had been up 24 hours in order to make sure we could get hate. She saved the day more then once and probably went through about 2k in peridots for runes to make this possible.<br>
<br>
Myriah for being very cool during some stressful situations and feeding me little bits of insight that helped alot.<br>
<br>
Mennian for running 2 CR's and brining the group back fast and ready to fight. He kept a cool head through the whole thing as some of us pulled our hair out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Milven for being the only Wizard through most of the raid and being very cool about porting all the reinforcments up.<br>
<br>
Mondoli awesome job pulling yet again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Nluamin from Celtica lead the pulling like a champ and even tried to refuse my offer of loot at the end. Wasn't going to happen but he did try. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Nluamin and Florie (Celtica) deserve a great deal of thanks for their help.  Honestly, I was expecting a much more difficult break.  With only two wizards able to get groups into Hate, we did quite well.  The most important thing to remember about raids, especially in the planes, typically there are a lot of deaths, and CR time is long.  I felt we pulled together pretty quickly, got back up there, and finished the break in without too bad a delay.  If you leave a raid with more experience than you started with, buy a lottery ticket, because it doesn't happen often.<br>
<br>
The only thing I think we truly need to work on is keeping the pulls more consistent.  I definitely don't think the pull group did a bad job (hey, I was in it).  It will just take a few more raids like this for us to get our act together and get comfortable with each other and our capabilities.  I also think having a second feign death puller would help with keeping things more consistent.  Mondoli and Nluamin did an excellent job of scouting and pulling.  Unfortunately, with only one puller, once aggro builds up and they have to /q out, there is considerable downtime that can be avoided with a second puller.  At least I think it is worth considering.<br>
<br>
Nice work all, grats on the loot, looking forward to Hate 3. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uswmaestrosheerwill.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Swmaestro Sheerwill</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/7/01 7:26:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Results of Hate 5/6</span><hr size=1> Grats everyone, and thanks for the BP, everyone did an excellent job.<br>
<br>
A few quick thoughts...<br>
1) Twice, I saw people on the raid getting quite offended by other people's suggestions, I even had a group member that left my group without notice because of this.<br>
If someone suggest something to you, it is best for everyone on the raid to do one of two things: take their advice for what it is: advice, and try it out and see if it works.... or: tell them you have already tried that/you know that won't work, and move on. Please don't assume the worst and think people are trying to get on your case, or trying to put you down.<br>
On this same note, I saw a few clerics getting rather angry when they were told it was best to use CH instead of celestial against Maestro... the response i heard from most was If you wanted to be a cleric why didn't you, and we use celestial to counter mob damage so we can land a CH... If a tank asks you to use CH instead of celestial, they most likely have a more valid reason than trying to upset you. In the case of Maestro, I know that when I am being tripled for 290 every 1.5 or less seconds, celestial healings 3 or 4 hundred hp every 6 seconds doesn't help much. This is most likely why others were suggesting to use CH.<br>
<br>
2) I just noticed this last night while looking up some of the loot we had received: Zombei was awarded the Indicolite greaves that dropped, and although nothing can be done about it now and noone spoke up at the time, I feel this was a waste of an item for everyone there... When we do a raid, we are there to improve the guild (or in this case the alliance) as a whole... if you look at the stats on the greaves Zombei had beforehand (RFV) and compare to the ones he received, there is a marginal difference (I would say they are of virtually equal value), whereas our other tanks (not including myself, at this time I had already won the BP) were still using crafted or worse...<br>
<br>
Crafted: ac 14 str 1 sv f c d 2<br>
RFV: ac 19 str 7 hp 30 NODROP<br>
Indicolite: ac 20 str 5 sta 5 agi 5 NODROP<br>
<br>
So what the alliance as a whole got from a pair of ac 20 5 5 5 greaves was a loss of 2 str and a loss of 30 hp, with a gain of 5 sta and 5 agi...<br>
<br>
What I would suggest in the future, using this case as an example, would be to have not let Zombei roll on the greaves, but guarantee him the first helm/bracer that dropped, as he still had crafted in these spots. It would help out the alliance as a whole most.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time, and congratulations to everyone on a great, and well executed raid, and thank you to Zenknight for going insane leading it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I think the RL (Zenknight) does an awesome job leading but we need to have some others take up some of the detail roles.  I got time to play, this was a total surprise to me, and wanted to attend the raid if I was needed.  Being that I was not expecting to log on and I was in Karnors.  I talk in guild and get told to talk to Bamil.  He says talk to Zenknight.  Zenknight was very busy, with just cause.  I could never get an answer as to me going.  I am not flaming anybody for the job they did, I know Zenknight he ROCKS, I am just thinking we should let somebody else on the raid help out these sort of things.<br>

<br>
The problem that we had yesterday was completely logistical. <br>
<br>
First Hate stones cost 250pp each depending on who buys it. What this means is that we want to maximize port ups to hate since each one requires 1 hate stone. Personally having laid out 1900pp for 9 hate stones that day I wanted to see people get organized first and come up in groups of 5. Knowing full well that I had to recoupe plat for the Enchanters, Clerics, other hate stone buyers(Holt got 4 more), puller and scout, not to mention keep a few blue diamonds for people to roll on I wanted to port people up as efficiently as possible. I took a complete bath on this hate trip. I think I got about 500pp worth of cash loot to cover the stones I paid for and luckily won a Blue Diamond. I probably won't sell the BD as I to would like some resist gear. The reason for the financial speash was this, we can't port just one person up per stone. People sent me tells all day long about wanting to come up but there was no way I could justify wasting one hate stone for 1 port up. In the future maybe set meeting times for interested people would be best as it didn't happen on it's own as I hoped.<br>
<br>
Secondly we had 1 Wizard to do the ports up for most of the day. In order for Milven to port up he had to gate out, have a hate stone on him get the person / persons that wanted to come up and port up. They then had to run to where we were camped around Roamer mobs and hopefully not train the camp or die in the process Causing us to stop pulling and CR them to the camp. Rez, buff, and group them takes time out of pulling for the entire group.<br>
<br>
So in essence it's yesterday it was hard for us to get people into hate unless they either were already grouped or we were at a stoping point to CR them.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if this was a problem but porting a single person into the middle of the raid was very time consumming and expensive. Would have loved to have had you there though.<br>

Just some small things.<br>
<br>
1.  Milven needs Translocate.  He was porting out with people, and porting in with people.  If he could have just Translocated people out this would have saved us a few thousand plat on stones.  On the same topic.  If people show up late, then they should bring their own Hate stone.  It's 250p, yes.  But everyone else was there on time.  I know not everyone can make it, but to expect someone to leave the raid, then come get you, then you run to camp, die, and raid stops so you AND Milven can get rez'd is asking a bit much.  I bought Milven Translocate after the raid.  I will absorb the cost, consider it my contribution of 3 hate stones.  I think it would be a good idea to make someone in charge of getting people to and fro the raid in Hate other than the leader.<br>
<br>
2.  You can not punish Zombei for having decent armor by not allowing him to roll on armor that IS an improvement, no matter how slight of an improvement you see it to be.  Zombei and I busted our asses killing dwarfs in Icewell to get him his legs and BP (as well as mine).  Are you going to say he can't roll on the BP either if it drops because his BP is better than crafted ?<br>

<br>
We certainly have many areas of improvement reguarding the taking of hate.I agree with mennian have multiple FD pullers would be a great asset allowing us to pull out the first floor in a manner wch doesnt leave us dragging behind enough to keep reencountering roamers. Not that I'd want us to actually make it to our revnant corner next time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Everyone did a great job and kept bickering to a minimum all things considered. We havent the numbers to allow us the luxory of breaks.Hence tempers flaired up a bit here and there but we all overcame the little sillinesses.Grats to all who won their stuff.

A verry special thanks and congratulations for a job well done goes out to my partner the Ebony Goddess Lady Myriah.At the beggining you though you'd have a partner givin out C2, then I deleveled on break. Yet you managed to keep us all with it while maintaining the patience of a saint.

Hopefully next time we will have back up for her ya know so she can take a minute to unwind.<br>

Sure Zombei and you busted your ass on the dorfs getting their armor, but letting him have the legs doesn't help us out much as a whole (relative to the other warriors getting them).<br>
I understand your point (I think) so I will try my best to address it... you feel that what we're doing is basically punishing him for having good gear, and quite frankly yes thats what it is... I spent many an hour in FP getting all my gear, and thanks to it I have among other things cobalt arms and gloves. I would never roll on the Indico arms and gloves unless they were going to rot... (nor would i do so for the boots, as I have RFV)<br>
Am I punishing myself? Yes. I could go to FP with my new indico arms and gloves, pawn off my cobalt, and have in the low 20s kpp to spend on some new piece(s) of loot. And I would probably do so if it was a pick-up raid, however seeing as this was an (almost) all-alliance raid, I feel the gear should be distributed with a touch of subjectivity.<br>
If Zombei's RFV legs had been tradeable, well then of course he should have gotten the indico, and simply handed the RFV down to whoever rolled 2nd highest or whatnot, but as it stands and like I said above, from a drop we as an alliance got with 20 ac 5 str 5 sta 5 agi, the net gain was 1 ac, -2 str, -30 hp, 5 sta, 5 agi...<br>
<br>
Did I answer your concern (doubt it) or did you have something in mind that I didn't cover?<br>

I was not asking to port just me.  I was asking when was the next group going.  I NEVER thought I would get a single port up.  If there were several people wanting to go I just wanted to know if I should even bother trying to get ready to go.

<br>
Your point is a very valid one. At some point in the future I hope that we have the insight to see that the stronger we all are as a group the better we will all benefit. It's nice to see that your looking at the big picture.<br>
<br>
Having said that using Zombei as an example is kind of wrong. Although I understand that he is a literary example. I had to argue with him before the first hate raid that he would loot the indo arms if they dropped. His point was he has cobalt there for he doesn't need them. He hadn't, at the time anyway, taken into account that some of the pieces have resists on them. No the arms don't but the boots do and great ones at that. If I had cobalt boots and was fighting a mob that did poison or disease, I would switch gear to get my resists up, hence loot the boots if I had cobalt as an example. Also what happens on a bad CR when we need to bring more tanks to get our bodies out. having 2 good sets of armor would save the day in a situation like that.<br>
<br>
Back to your point. I do agree with you that we should try and do less personal looting and more &quot;what makes the SGA stronger looting&quot; but we are not at a point in the SGA to even attempt to implemetent that. At the moment that is a philosphy of more team oriented guilds and all of us having come from smaller guilds where individual self reliance is key have yet to move in this direction. Someday it may happen.<br>

We had some tough moments but I think we all can agree that we handled CR like pros and that went far to cut down on the anxiety/stress that is caused when you are worried about the implications of TPW in Hate.<br>
<br>
We finally are equipping the Hate classes with planes armor. I think if you look at that list of people who won, for most it was their first piece. That is a nice collective step for us.<br>
<br>
Syrtic, I'm sorry you missed out on the raid, but I will echo what Zen said. From your end you have gotten some time to play and the raid is going on and you want to join, and Bamil and Zenknight are ignoring you. Believe me, we could have definitely used you and wanted you to join. <br>
<br>
However let me offer some perspective. Yours was one of about 400 tells I received all day concerning the raid (we were there for 13 hours). Half of these tells were from people not in the SGA and completely unbeknownst to me. During all this I am trying to pay attention to multiple mobs, where a mistake could mean a costly CR, be group leader, loot master, and basically the one getting every tell that Zen can't respond to from within the raid and out. Combine that with being up since the crack of dawn and trying to coordinate several CR's, setting up groups, and just the general stress that goes along with this kind of raid. If you could see my log you would see that your tell would have just spammed by my screen at the time you sent it. So it may seem as if we were slighting you or didn't care if you joined or not, but that is simply not the case.<br>
<br>
My suggestion in the future would be to continue to send multiple tells and do what you can to make it easy for the raid leaders (ie have a hate stone and be in S Ro with a group rdy to port). I remember receiving your tell now bro, and I feel bad, but please understand it was not a personal conscious decision that we didn't want Syrtic to join, that it was we were 8 hours into the raid and at almost no time was it not chaos.<br>
<br>
I think we all did a good job yesterday. I want to thank the group leaders like Kry and Swmmy and others that made my life easier by ensuring members were getting grouped properly and that the groups were set up correctly. Zen, you lead a great raid as always and you should be commended for all the work you have put in over the last week and our 2 hate successful hate raids.<br>
<br>
Well, we knew we could run a good Fear raid. We can now add Hate to our list. Let's continue to get armor for our classes from both planes over the next month and continue to set our sights higher (started on your Sleepers key's yet?? :P ).<br>

Always have, I just think several misunderstandings have led many people to believe I don't...<br>
<br>
To clarify a bit more:<br>
- I am a powergamer (that sounds evil to me in the context of EQ)<br>
- I am not a loot/exp whore<br>
- I play EQ for fun<br>
- Getting loot and exp IS fun for me, being a powergamer (but so is friendship, helping out others, and everything else most of you enjoy)<br>
- If you ever see me complaining or saying something negative, it is either sarcasm or me joking, I am a very positive person<br>
- It is impossible to offend me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That is probably why I offend so many people, because the things I say would not offend me, therefore I don't even consider the fact that they might offend someone else<br>

<br>
You're still penalizing Zombei and preventing him from improving his armor.  No matter how small of an improvement it is.  <br>
<br>
Using your theory, because Zombei (and again, I'm only using him as an example) had went out and gotten some RFV armor that now he's relegated to not improve upon it until every other warrior that's there that has crappier armor improves theirs first.<br>
<br>
At the rate in which new warriors would show up in Hate, Zombei would always be at the bottom of the list to improve his legs.  Everytime some new skirt wearing barbarian showed up with crafted legs, Zombei would be behind him.  <br>
<br>
Does this sound fair to Zombei ?<br>
<br>
And again, him and I camped in Icewell for about a month straight getting our armor.  We begged people to come, but no one would.  Ask Zenknight, he's been trying to get people there for weeks.<br>
