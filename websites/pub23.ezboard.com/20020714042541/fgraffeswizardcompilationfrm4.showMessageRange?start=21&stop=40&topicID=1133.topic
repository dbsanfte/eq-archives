<br>
Atheism is often accused of being &quot;cold,&quot; as if atheists were somehow incapable of emotions, just robotic Vulcans or something.  Very silly.  Disheartening?  Maybe, but just because you do not like a thing doesn't mean it is untrue.  I don't feel terribly disheartened; I don't have time for it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Invention of a rebellious society?&quot;  I wouldn't call it an invention at all, but the logical conclusion of knowledge and thought collected through the ages.  While non-believers may be in a state of rebellion against their particular, believing, culture, rebellion is hardly the point of atheism.  <br>
<br>
I'm very happy that my beliefs (and non-beliefs) are logically founded.  I don't think I could live otherwise.<br>

While the idea of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent being is a bit far-fetched, is it any more difficult to swallow than the idea that due to entropic forces the universe just happened?<br>
<br>
See, that's the fundamental question behind whether there's a God to me: was there a catalyst behind the &quot;Big Bang&quot;? Science, the last bastion of atheism, teaches us that nothing happens without a catalyst, that nothing happens without some force to provoke it.<br>
<br>
In my mind, there's no doubt that there's something up there that we either can't, or won't explain. Some force beyond our current level of understanding that acted as a catalyst for the Big Bang, and probably has the ability to interfere with the workings of the Universe as we know it. What's wrong with applying the name &quot;God&quot; to that force?<br>
<br>
What I would question, however, is whether this God is conscious of what it did/is doing: Whether there's intelligence behind it. On that level, I'm an agnostic. I don't honestly know. I've seen what could be described as divine intervention that is beneficial, and that which is detrimental. We could just be a science experiment, for all we know.<br>
<br>
But I don't think that really matters, either. The human mind is capable of incredible things, and incredible control over the body. Hypochondria is a psychological disease with physical effects that are created by the belief that you suffer. By the same token, the human mind is capable of creating health and happiness from nothing simply by believing.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter what you believe in, just that you believe. People who believe in a God tend to be happier, and they tend to be healthier. Whether this is truly because a God is intervening on their behalf or whether the mind is creating the euphoria is unimportant: The fact of the matter is that it's there. If you believe your salvation will come from God, Allah, Jehova, Jesus, or a Fish called Wanda, I simply won't enter into a debate to prove you wrong. I won't deny you of that belief, because I think it's good for you to have the belief.<br>
<br>
I will, however, question and at times mock atheists. This group often feels threatened by the idea of God and fights very hard to protect everbody from it. If God doesn't exist, though, then what are they afraid of?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On Organized Religion? Meh. Some people believe that they need to express their belief by spending 1/7 of their life in a Church.

And I've come to my own sort of opinionated conclusion.<br>
Throughout time people have pondered for answers to every question they could think of. To answer these questions, people created myths and legends and higher beings to &quot;believe&quot; in. Eventually science came into play. Science was the new way of explaining things and myths and legends were phased out, as we were able to better explain things.<br>
I think religion is somewhat lazy and simple. You focus the entire reason and answer to how and why you're on this earth into some higher power that controls it. It seems rather easy to just blame someone/thing else for the way things are, doesn't it?<br>

I haven't met many atheists who felt threatened by the idea of a god. My experience tends to show that those possessed of religious beliefs feel threatened by the idea of atheism.<br>

Umm...persecution by and destruction at the hands of those who feel their belief systems are threatened by atheists. History is chock-full of grisly examples of what members of a given religion do to those who believe differently. <br>

Actually, the Christians have used this line of argument for quite some time in the effort to demonstrate the existence of a god. Check catechism...the whole, &quot;Who made me?&quot; line. Causality is all well and good, but if there is something that doesn't require a creator I'm more comfortable with calling it the universe than Jehovah.<br>

<br>
Most of these deaths and wars are cause by people, for their own desires, who then use religion to convince people to support them. They so this because religion is such an important thing to people. If there were no religions, the tyrants would find something else to use, whatever would be the most important thing to people in that circumstance.<br>
<br>
Most of the religions I have studied (a little, by no means an expert here) abhor violence, and have a significant component equate to being selfless to others. Yet that part seems harder to use on the masses to get them all to get along. It is the easier road to use anything that supports hatred when trying motivate masses. It seems fairly easy (using history as my guide) for large groups of people to be manipulated into violence. <br>
<br>
I do not think Religion is to blame, it is just very important to people, and therefore a powerful tool to use and misuse. If there were no Religion, there would be other things used to cause the same distruction.<br>
<br>
For the record, I am a Roman Catholic, if that helps to add or remove credibility to what I have just written. <br>

<br>
Either way you look at the creation dilemma you end up with the same problem. Something from nothing. Big Bang? what was the catalysy? God? Who created him?<br>
<br>
I believe in the Big Bang. Makes sense to me. I compare it to how a life grows from a single cell into a complex organism. No real consiousness behind the growth, just chemicals. Maybe there was something or somebody who initiated the act of growth but I don't believe that if was a conscious being who got the ball rolling, they really know or care what is happening in our universe.. let alone our planet.<br>

What's wrong with applying the name &quot;God&quot; to that force?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This implys that there is a being up there in charge of everything and, like somebody else wrote, influenced. I just don't believe that this is possible. From my experience all we have is ourselves and each other. I have never seen or felt anything that would make me believe otherwise. This is not to say that I don't think there are many things we don't and probably won't ever comprehend.. it just means that the whole idea of a &quot;omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent being&quot; is just too far fetched for me to believe.<br>
<br>
<br>
The only way this would make sense to me (time to get a bit metaphysical I suppose.. LOL I guess that is what this whole thread is dealing with. Metaphysics) would be to say that God is in fact the Universe. That would mean that I, and you, and everything is part of God and that is why it is proper to give God labels like omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent because, by definition, the Universe is everything. Reminds me of a poem by Ginsberg.. I'll write it down a snippet here for y'all. Quiet now, poetry time..<br>

This poem rings true to me. What it means to me is that we are reflections of God (the Universe) and God (the Universe) is a reflection of us. We are both the creation and the creator. It is through us that God experiences itself.<br>
<br>

I only need to provide one example: Where did all of this come from? If you believe my physics books, Energy can neither be created, nor destroyed. So how did it come to be that all of this Energy is here? Where did the fuel behind the Big Bang come from? And what ignited that fuel?<br>
<br>
Science can only see that far. We have no way of knowing what happened before the Big Bang, and we never will. As a result, we have absolutely no way of knowing what was happening before this event. You might even say that we have to take it on faith that it actually happened....<br>

I don't really think it does dismiss God. There are some who believe that God is a divine entity, and some who believe that God is a state of mind. Perhaps it's both.

Maybe you're right. Atheists do vehemently push the separation of Church from the masses, though. They take *great* offense when Religion is put into school, and yet the religious, who vastly outnumber the atheists, don't really complain when it's removed. Those who are vocal tend to be the ones who fear something.<br>
<br>
But maybe you're right. I, for one, don't really like the idea that we're alone. I also don't really think that this deity is an &quot;eternal parent&quot;. Perhaps a progenitor, but I think that if it's still around it doesn't do much intervening. Maybe God's dead, or maybe God exists only in our minds.<br>
<br>
In the end, though, I don't think I'm qualified to judge the status of God. I don't think anybody really is, and I'm content to leave it at that.<br>
<br>
<br>

I'm fence-sitting on the matter, I know.

<br>
For the record, I am a practicing Lutheran, for whatever that may be worth.  I'm free to be a Lutheran and not interfere with you as you are free to be an athiest and not interfere with me.<br>
<br>
The question is thus:<br>
<br>
Suppose 100 athiests are put into one of two situations.  <br>
<br>
The first situation is a scenario in which they are the current victim of armed robbery and the perpetrator is considering pulling the trigger on them.  <br>
<br>
The second situation is a scenario in which they are involved in a military conflict (whether by voluntary service or through conscription) in which they are looking down the barrel of the enemy's weapon.<br>
<br>
My question is how many of the 100 athiests are either saying or thinking, &quot;Please, God ....&quot;<br>
<br>
Food for either interesting thought or uninteresting thought, but an interesting thought nonetheless.<br>
