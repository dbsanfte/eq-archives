(GM event on Veeshan)</span><hr size=1> Last night on a rather silent night for my guild. We heard a great rumor that the walls of Veeshan's Peak were shakeing. <br>
<br>
My first spot was the Dreadlands. There was reports from our spies that a Great Dragon was spotted near the Burning woods area. The dragon Phar Dar.  We looked around but could not find anything. <br>
<br>
We evaced to Skyfire and took a look around. There was something wrong. The ground shook many times. Lava  began to bubble. The walls of VP had started to crumble. rumor had it that Veeshan is mad about the slaying of her numbers. <br>
<br>
However in the middle of the Lava Lake the big one in the center of the zone we heard massive screams.  On a pillar above the Lava lake awaken from a deep sleep by the shifts in the land stood an aciant Monster.  He was the size of Wurm. However he was the same life as the bottomeless feeders.  He was black in color. He casted Massive Dispell and knockback. (thus throwing many into the lava Lake to thier deaths.) He casted a rain  spell that dropped fire on everyone.  After many minutes he began to attack everyone that had come to look. He was lvl 60 and we all fought back. In the end an Ice Spear  foun the mark and sent this beast to its death. I looked over the Body and found several spells, Demi lich, Dictate, Sunstrike etc. 4 essence emeralds, two Blue Diamonds and a relic sword &quot;A gleaming Basterd sword&quot;. This was the very mythical sword that was found on the first Lady Vox.  I called out with my claim of the object but nothing happend, it snowed for  five minutes and then it was over. <br>
<br>
/ooc I expected the sword to be an object that would have to be turned in to stop the events or something a little more involved. I have been on many GM events and was thinking hey maybe its my turn to get a title or item of power. For the Zone level, the mob level its location (middle of a lava lake) I expected a little more. However there was no talking and although the other items were of great value almost 70k in value. The sword was powerful by old world standerds but nowadays I would not give it to jojabber. I really wished it was for something more. Anyone else seen this event yet with an answer maybe I overlooked something.<br>

     But not in all cases... Alot of these &quot;encounters&quot; I think would be extremely easy if given the right rescources.. Like... Gorenaire, who spanked us with 36 people.. Take out a radom 6-7 of those people and swap them with lvl 60 wizards, and bam. Dead Dragon..   Dunno... <br>

     I can see some &quot;encounters&quot; being rough, and actually needing tactics, but not nearly even 50% of them...<br>

All of this takes many deaths - another guild just reading on how to do it cheapens both their experience and empowers other guilds who are not willing to take the time to learn all this, and creates competition<br>

<br>
Let's say that Ubermob Foo has X hitpoints, let's say it deals Y points of damage per second.  Further, let's say that it has special attack Z.  Let's also say that it requires A number of people, B of which must be warriors, C must be wizards, D are clerics, E, F, G, must be rogues monks and hubrid melees.  Further it requires pulling technique H, and you must kill mobs J, K, and L beforehand and wait in spot M for repops, pull, and kill.<br>
<br>
I count 15 unknowns.  Let's say that you wipe out 5 times trying to figure out the solution to all these unknowns, with attendand corpse recoveries, and rebuffs, and going again, and wiping out again.  Let's further pretend that it is a Friday night, and a club downtown is having an even that is going to be the coolest thing since sliced bread, and your girlfriend wants to go, but you spend all Friday night throwing yourself at this uber mob, and now your girlfriend is angry, and you aren't going to get laid for another 2 weeks, and you are going to have to buy dinner to make it up to her.<br>
<br>
You know, if it's costing me a Friday night to figure out the strategy to win, and if it's causing me to miss a cool party, and if I have to deal with an angry girlfriend and no sex for two weeks, I'll be goddamn if I am going to give the solution to you for free, just to have you camp the same mob and demand that my guild sings up for the mob on some calendar or what have you.  You go figure it out your own damn self and kiss my ass.  Phat Lewts require some sacrifice.  I am not spoon feeding you.<br>

What, the &quot;uber&quot; wizards don't come here to help people out? Go look at the library section, go to the uber-mob resistance chart. It took us time and deaths to figure those out, and we shared them here because it helps the wizard community as a whole. We're not on the same track Grimstaff, there is a difference between strategies and secrets that benefit WIZARDS and strategies and secrets that are developed to aid GUILDS and RAIDS. The things withheld from screenshots are thsoe that the GUILD developed so that they work more efficicently and win against X mob with less and less deaths. There is a difference between the higher level Wizards coming here to give hints and their guild keeping strategies a secret. The strategies you see ommitted and blurred out often took repeated deaths by 36+ people and numerous hours or even days to develop. Excuse me if the group that came up with those strategies doesn't want to go screaming and shouting about how they did it and what you have to do to repeat it. If they did so it would negate their effort and time and cheapen the experience for them.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/26/01 8:22:12 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/grimmy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: how?</span><hr size=1> Cheapen the experience?

You guys have an attitude that is fine for your guild, it works.  But its just wierd for most people to see how you act about a game, especially given your attempts to defend it.  You don't want people to know because it was hard to get.  That's basically what it comes down to, you don't want to share, you aren't interested in letting anyone know anything but the slightest bits of data because you worked hard to get them.  Mind you there might be other reasons, perhaps related to recent guild disbandings, which would be more defensible, but do you really see how that looks to people?<br>
<br>
Keep in mind here I don't have any particular desire to wake the sleeper, I don't like raids much (boring, 2 hours of setup for 30 seconds of fun, lots of dying whee thats a blast), this isn't about my desire to know things.  I just find that uber attitude so wierd I have to question it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samadhi BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Sorcerer</font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/26/01 8:52:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: how?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Mind you there might be other reasons, perhaps related to recent guild disbandings, which would be more defensible, but do you really see how that looks to people?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Nice little jab Grimstaff, were you trying to prove your point or just throw out a random attack with this?<br>

Wow Grim, that's pretty bitter! I'd hate to direct you back to the threads on whineplay regarding the Wizard epic that I started and the so called &quot;uber&quot; wizards kept going that got our epic changed. That would ruin your whole outlook that we're nothing but selfish look-out-for-ourselves evil manipulating etc etc etc Wizards!!<br>
<br>
I agree Grimstaff. Once (if) Bush gets the new weapons defense platform developed, we can go send the data and blueprints to the Chinese, Iraqis, and Zee Germans!!<br>
<br>
You don't spend time and energy working on something just to give it away for free. You don't work your life off to buy a house and then give the keys to a hobo in the street. Like anything else in life achieving certain things in EverQuest takes time and energy. If you still can't grasp the concept of people not wanting to lessen their achievement by just giving away the strategies they sacrificed developing, Im afraid your outlook on EQ is a bit skewed.<br>

<br>
Grimstaff, not everyone likes to deal with having neighbors, especially neighbors that used to be hobos.<br>
<br>
We have all the beginning junk spelled out for us. Where to hunt, what spells to use, how to do all the quests you want. I'm very glad that the top guilds are not blabbing about how to play the top encounters. I want to figure those out for myself.<br>
<br>
Sharing strategies you worked very hard to develop does not cheapen the experience for you, it cheapens it for everyone that hears it.<br>
