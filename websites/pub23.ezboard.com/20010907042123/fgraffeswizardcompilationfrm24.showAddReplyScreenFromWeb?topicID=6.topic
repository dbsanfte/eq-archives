<br>
I wasn't sure it would help, but I'd been down to the goblins and I definitely wouldn't have survived if I'd got close so I wondered if wolf-form would help. It did.<br>
<br>
I'm guessing that the Lake Rathetear rod will be achievable with Enduring Breath and Wolf-Form. The Everfrost one shouldn't be too much of a struggle for me as I've heard of lower level Wizards handling the skeletons (or rooting them and gating out after grabbing the rod). Might Wolf-Form also help here?<br>
<br>
The only rod I'm likely to have major trouble with (apart from getting the druidly assistance) is the LGuk one. I'm guessing Wolf-Form isn't allowed indoors...? Invis vs Undead might be useful for me from a handy nearby caster (it is targettable isn't it?) Can you have both normal Invis and Invis vs Undead on at the same time? I hear the Vampire Bats aren't undead so see you and aggro, breaking IvU. Is &quot;the hand&quot; spawn camped very often? It would be nice to just stroll in there, grab the rod and gate out...<br>

Lake Rathe requires Enduring Breath.<br>
<br>
Everfrost might require Enduring Breath, depends on your swimming skill (100+ would cut it close).  You also have to watch out for Miragul (sp?).  He has a nasty habit of roaming around down there and killing anyone he sees.<br>
<br>
You cannot have invis and invis vs undead on at the same time.  You'll have to wait for some group to clear the hand room, then swim up and grab the rod. <p><BR><BR>

<br>
I know that the ones down at the bottom in Oasis see invis (they would have ripped my head off if I had moved close enough) but didn't con the ones up top... I just swam off and came back once I had wolf form.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming that whatever you say about the goblins applies to Lake Rathe too...<br>
<br>
And as for the hand room and &quot;just swim up&quot;... I guess I ought to get some better maps as I didn't even know there was any water near to that room. It looks a bit of a maze and I'm sure I'm likely to die very easily (possibly multiple times) trying to get this rod. I suspect I might bank everything before I try, although that's going to mean clearing out my bank a bit...<br>

<br>
Yep.  My own experience has shown that the ones that see invis are usually on the lower level of the tower.  The ones on top typically don't see invis (although, rarely there's one that does).  Just grabbing the rod shouldn't agro the lower level.  And yes, this applies to Lake Rathe as well.<br>
<br>
The hand room is definately unique.  The floor is a normal room, but there's a pool of water suspended in mid-air.  You have to jump up into it and swim to the top.  At the top is a ledge.  That's where the hand, and one undead frog spawn.  The hand is alive, and invis works.  The frog is undead, and invis to undead works.  However, you can't have them both up, so you have to clear at least one of them out first.  The rod is on that ledge too.<br>

This mostly coincides with my experience. I got lucky in Oasis, all conned indifferent, weren't buffed with see invis so in I went and picked it up no problems, however I know a friend that died there as they were buffed with see invis.<br>
<br>
Lake Rathe was an experience for me. I was lvl 31 at the time I did most of the rods. (I didnt know about the Wolf Form trick) I swam down, and there was the named NPC's there, Deep. 1 of the goblins was buffed with see invis, the rest were indifferent. At this point I said screw it, I could see the rod and just wanted to be done with the quest. Swam in, picked it up and started swimming away when goblin started scratching me. Next I know I got nuked real hard, and the death message was something about me being slain by wrath. Im not sure if it was another NPC or this is just the message u get from a spell. Pity I didnt have logging turned on at the time. Fortunately my corpse fell at the bottom of the tower and not on top of it. Came back, dragged corpse looted and gated.<br>

In everfrost I hade Enduring breath and a druid with me, but the skellies were very green to me at 24, we dropped them and gated out.<br>
<br>
Lower Guk Is basicly done 1 of 3 ways:<br>
1) Get a group and take the Bedroom, kill at Vamp bats, ITU and run to the hand room. Then fight the hand and _2_ ghoulies. <br>
<br>
2) Go to Lower Guk when it is heavilty camped and take advantace of the fact that everyone is waiting for stuff to spawn. Make sure the bedroom cleans out the Vamp bats, ITU to the hand room and wait for that group ti be in a fight. Grab the wand and gate.<br>
<br>
3) *The way I did it* Take a swig of Tequila in RL, Go to Lower Guk, wait till the bedroom cleans out thebats, ITU to the hand room. SWIM UP THE OPPOSITE WALL TO THE LEDGE AND FIND THE ROD VISUALLY. Know where you are going, I was not bothered when I was pasted against the wall opposite the ledge where the hand and his buddies are. When you have your mark, swim up the ledge side, jump onto the ledge and grab the wand. Put in inventory (have the screen up) and GET BACK TO THE WATER. Die, and repeat process except loot and gate. The dead body will sink to the floor below. <p>Ennya Orcsbane<BR>

As much as I think it's dumb for mobs to SOMETIMES see invis, this is the case here.  It's usually just the easy way out for some ppl because they get conflicting reports from others.  For me the Rathe ones didn't and the Oasis ones did.  But then again, I didn't see any shamans in Rathe and I did in Oasis.  Maybe it's like Perma with the casters seeing invis.  Just have someone pull the tower in Oasis (not too hard to do, since ppl do it on accident most of the time anyways while coming from the isle tower), and when in Rathe, con, con, con.  If the rathies see invis, either wait for a repop, or wait untill someone camps them, which i've heard happens now, since there's an epic quest item dropped down there.<br>

<br>
Not true. I'm convinced that whether they see invis is  random, at least in Lake Rathetear, perhaps Oasis as well. The Goblins didn't see me invisible in Oasis but I died in Rathe because 1 of the three at the top of the tower was scowling and blue while invis. I decided to just go for it and take my chances hoping to MAYBE get a Gate off in time. No dice, but I did pick up the rod and got some help dragging the corpse to shore. <br>
<br>
Just a warning. You might get a set of Goblins none of whom see invis and you might not. <br>

<br>
On the gob towers, yes, there are definitely sometimes gobs that see invis, they are casters and they buff themselves. My Lake Rathe rod had one in the top of the tower, but it didn't agro on me as I grabbed the rod while floating past the window. Oasis, the rod was in the very middle, but fortunately there weren't any see invis ones in the tower.<br>
<br>
On the lower guk side of things, I was able to get the rod without agroing the hand by simply not getting out of the water. I've had one other person tell me the rod was too far from the water, but I got it ok. Maybe it spawns in different spots?

The middle of the column is filled with a floating pool of water, which I reached by running up the far wall of the room after you enter. Above the top edge of the water is the &quot;Hand Room&quot; which is essentially a very small ledge with an altar, the rest of the floor is made up of the water.<br>
<br>
It gets a little disorienting, but I believe that as you enter the room below, the hand is above and behind you. I may be very wrong about that though (adrenaline and all that), but I can definitely say that the Hand did not aggro on me, even though I had to surface several times right in front of him. The hard part is simply not stepping out of the water as you bob up and down. The safest course is simply waiting for the hand room to be camped, but that wasn't a satisfactory uption on Sullon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Regardless of campedness, if you stick to the left wall in the bat room and the right wall as you run past the big skellies (both of which see through invis vs undead) they should not agro on you. Then jump down to the left when you get to the bridge (you will take a few damage here, but this gets you onto the part of the www.eqatlas.com map that has all the straight lines) The very small and hard to see box with an 'x' in it on that same map is a pit that you can jump over, it is right after something that looked sort of like a bed of coals. If you fall down the pit, just climb up the ladder, and you will be just past the hand room hallway if memory serves. NOTE: there are two passages from the &quot;bedroom&quot; to the &quot;bat&quot; room, take the left one or else...<br>
<br>
Good luck! <p><img src=http://www.houselokri.com/banners/diedresig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uqorbeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>QorbeQ</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/28/01 12:01:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Staff Acquired! Plus Guk Information</span><hr size=1> <br>
Big story ahead... :-)<br>
<br>
I managed to finally get my Staff of the Wheel last night. And well pleased I am too - 204 int and looking good :-)<br>
<br>
As for the rod in Lower Guk... well... can you say &quot;awkward&quot;? :-)<br>
<br>
I decided to make myself a little stooge rogue so that I could have a poke around in there undetected... got my brother to port him over to S.Ro and legged it into Guk. Sneak/hide took a couple of times to stick but then I snuck all the way through to the hand room (aside - you don't *have* to drop down the pit near the room - the trap is easily avoided).<br>
<br>
It's an odd room alright. When you enter the room the ledge with the hand and &quot;a-n-other-spawn&quot; is above your head. If you go to the back wall and swim up there you're going to be as far away from the ledge as you get.<br>
<br>
My rogue spent at least 30 minutes in there watching things. One thing I found was that, when he first surfaced, the hand was waaay back at the rear of the ledge, a ghoul wizard was in the middle of the ledge and the rod was right at the front next to the waterline.<br>
<br>
Just out of interest, he grabbed the rod that was there, destroyed it, and then got out of the water for a look around.<br>
<br>
I waited for ages for the rod to respawn and didnt' see it. Then finally I noticed that the rod had respawned in a different place. There are at least five different spawn spots for it on that ledge. Some at the front, some right at the back.<br>
<br>
I can see that, if you were *really* lucky and the hand was right at the back of the ledge and the rod had spawned right at the front of the ledge and you still had Invis to Undead on then you *might* be able to grab it from in the water.<br>
<br>
However, after my recon mission with the rogue I decided that I knew where I was going and what I was doing so I collared a Cleric at the Upper Guk zone.<br>
<br>
He duelled me to death to make me naked and then provided Invis to Undead for me.<br>
<br>
I ran right to the hand room and, ignoring my initial decision to camp there and bring my rogue back on to check the status above the water, I swam up at the furthest point away from the hand.<br>
<br>
When I turned around to look at the ledge, the hand was swimming towards me and the wizard was firing up a spell. Doh!<br>
<br>
I swam for the ledge, jumped up, glanced at the places I knew the rod spawned, located it, looted it, stuck it in my inventory, jumped back in the water and then promptly forgot to even try gating. I died.<br>
<br>
I then decided that my level 2 rogue could help me out. I logged him on (he's still there, camped in the hand room!) and found my corpse sitting on the floor under the water. Hooray! A body with the rod on it --- now to get it out of there...<br>
<br>
Good old rogue dragged that body around for ages before finally admitting defeat and /ooc'ing &quot;How do I get off the level with the hand room&quot;?<br>
<br>
Many replies of &quot;you're screwed dude&quot; convinced me that there was no way back up to the zone line. Doh!<br>
<br>
I decided to leave my body right next to the place you drop off, hoping that with Invis to Undead my Wizard could get there and /corpse the body up top.<br>
<br>
Things became complicated when my brother's level-60 Druid and my friend's level 57 warrior and 58 cleric turned up to &quot;help&quot;. Invising us, the druid and I ran down to get my body. It had disappeared. The cleric at the zone line said something about my body being up there. Confused we dallied a little too long and my Invis to Undead dropped. Of course, I was fully kitted out at this point, having looted my main corpse.<br>
<br>
So now I had two bodies in Lower Guk. One with a rod for the quest and another with all my equipment on it.<br>
<br>
Doh!<br>
<br>
So, me, level 60 druid, level 57 warrior and level 58 cleric all hump down to the hand level again. I get a handy rez from the cleric's epic rez-stick and loot my main corpse. Phew - there's a relief.<br>
<br>
We spend a while hunting for my rod corpse to no avail. I gate back to Upper Guk and log my rogue on to retrace his steps to see where the body might be. Just before I camp they tell me that the warrior can target my corpse near where I left it but cannot drag it. They then go back to the zone and find that my body is also there - poking through the wall - and also cannot drag it (even though they were consented).<br>
<br>
Doh! My corpse is bugged!<br>
<br>
One &quot;wait for a reply to a /petition&quot; later and a GM puts my body nicely on the floor at the zone line. One rez later and I'm back together, most of my xp intact and the rod in my hands! Whoot!<br>
<br>
So, lessons to be learned...<br>
<br>
1) The hand may or may not aggro you when you surface - it depends on where he is on the ledge. I'm basing the &quot;not aggro&quot; on reports from others that he didn't aggro them.<br>
<br>
2) The rod does not spawn in exactly the same spot each time. Expect to have a quick hunt for it around the ledge. The five spots I saw were rear left, rear right (rear being right at the back), front left, front right and front centre.<br>
<br>
3) Follow the tried-and-true method of dying in the water, going back, looting your body under the water then gating out. You can't really put the corpse anywhere &quot;safer&quot; than the spot it drops from the water.<br>
<br>
4) While in the hand room my rogue saw undead frogloks come as far as the doorway of the room. Beware of this. If you are against the rear wall of the room (below the water) then they won't aggro but if you're any further forward towards the door I can imagine problems if ItU drops.<br>
<br>
<br>
So - there you go. Acquired my staff and star and now I'm a happy camper <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Thanks for the insight on the various spawn locations of the rod. That explains why I've gotten some mixed responses to the method I used. Guess I got lucky <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Using the rogue sounds incredibly useful. Unfortunately, I only have one account to work with, and Sullon limits us to one character per account. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://www.houselokri.com/banners/diedresig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm24>Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
