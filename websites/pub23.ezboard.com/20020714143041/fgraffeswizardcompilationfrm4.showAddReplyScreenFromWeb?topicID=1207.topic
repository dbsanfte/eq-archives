<br>
This just in!<br>
<br>
If you molest children, and you're a priest in the catholic chuch your punishment will be:<br>
<br>
1. They cannot call themselves &quot;father&quot; anymore.<br>
2. They cannot practice as priests anymore.<br>
3. They cannot wear the collar of the catholic chuch.<br>
<br>
Ok, for those of you that missed it, these pedophiles <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> are not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> being tossed out of the church. They are not being punished for breaking the law. They are basically saying that the priests are above the law, and that's my problem.<br>
<br>
I don't give a flying fuck if you think you're doing gods work, if you break a law, you deserve to be punished by the law. These fucking priests are not above us <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> normal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> people. They're just like you and I, except they're fucked in the head, and they like to molest children.<br>
<br>
Toss them in fucking jail, and let the prisoners deal with them. Every last one of them. I don't care if they're doing gods work. If gods work is molesting children, then I think all you religous types should rethink your vaules.<br>
<br>
Voice your opinions if you are a religious type person. I have nothing against religions. Well, I do against organized religion, but that isn't my issue. My issue is that we know these fuckers are guilty, we have evidence proving that they molested children, and yet we're completely powerless to punish these fucking bastards because they're priests.<br>

Man, our world is so fucked up, no wonder the aliens are staying away!<br>

Whoa... tone it down a bit.  I'll be the first to say I find the Catholic religion silly (while an agnostic myself, I've spent much of the past 5 years researching and studying religion, and I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> still</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> don't understand Catholicism), indirectly referring to all Catholic priests as molesters is a horrible thing to say.  There are thousands of priests who have strived to give whatever they can to their community, their faith, and their parish, and as a result of this scandal have had thier image tainted by the actions of a minority.  Please don't further the notion that the Catholic religion is all about raping small children, because it poisons the message of a worthy cause.<br>

I never said that. I said that those that are guilty shouldn't be above the law. I totally agree that the majority of priest are probably swell guys, but the way they're protecting the guilty ones, well, it really pisses me off.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but becoming a priest does not give that person diplomatic immunity. If they commit a crime in our country, they should have to pay the penalty. Simple as that.<br>
<br>
Toss them out of the catholic church, alert the local authorities, and let them deal with it.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but priests think that there is nothing besides god, and they also believe that if they're forgiven by another priest, then their sins are gone. That's total bullshit. It's called accountability. As far as I'm concerned, those that are protecting these sickos are as bad as those that commited the crime. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umissfoxfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miss Foxfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/02 3:22:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1207.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://gwynhyfar.homestead.com/files/hm9.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Priests... /sigh</span><hr size=1> Child molesters?

And before some of you jump to a defense of these people, some child molesters have actually lobbied for castration as a form of punishment. It's not a panacea because the sickness is in the mind, but removing sexual desire -- the real physical, visceral aspect of it -- in child molesters is something to be considered.

If that's not an indirect reference to calling all priests molesters, what is?  It's not a bunch of molesters enforcing punishment on the guys they trade kiddie pics with; it's several honest priests trying to deal with a serious problem amongst the minority in their flock.<br>
<br>
Yes, I think that the bishops and cardinals who tried to protect these wayward priests are just as guilty.  Yes, I think these molesters should have their balls cut off- and I don't mean in a nice way like castration, I mean with a rusty fork.

I will admit that would probably be interpretted as a blanket statement which is wrong. I just have this feeling that the incidence of child molesting is higher in the priesthood than it is in any other profession. However, since I have no evidence of this I'm not going to say that is true. After all, the very nature of being a priest will bring more attention to them which would only fuel the above statement. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukalkosshadowflame.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalkos Shadowflame</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/15/02 11:50:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1207.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> There's probably also a bunch of unreported child molesting issues with the Catholic church, too, keep in mind.<br>

<br>
Priests are NOT above the law.  If there is evidence, take them to trial, and let a jury decide.  I'm confused as to why this isn't happening.  Does it have something to do with US's separation of Church and State? (I'm Canadian.)<br>
<br>
As for 'everything being ok' once a priest goes to Confession...that only applies to his soul.  And I'm of the opinion that if a priest (or ANY catholic confessing a crime to his priest) is not required to accept punishment under the law as part of their penance, then that Confession is almost worthless.  God sees into the heart of man, and a few mumbled words are not sufficient to guarantee your soul has been 'cleansed', the penitent should prove their repentance by owning up and being accountable.<br>
<br>
Penance is defined as: a sacrament in some Christian churches that includes contrition, confession to a priest, acceptance of punishment, and absolution.<br>
<br>
What the Church SHOULD be doing, is requiring that as his penance that a priest confess to the authorities, apologize to his victims,  and accept lawful punishment (including being defrocked). Then said priest can receive absolution <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> for the good of his immortal soul</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and practice his faith while he serves his time.<br>

The separation of church and state in the US is intended to allow people to worship as they see fit; but we are also a country of lawyers (groan), making it difficult for prosecutors to compel the church to turn over documents relating to molestation within the church without already having substansial evidence.

Tossing people out of church once was the the worst punishment (and in the eyes of every church still is) there can be for a religious man. It would mean total loss of community ties, eternal damnation in Hell, and no possible way ever again on any rest for the soul.<br>
<br>
This is a Punishent not givven lightly, and is done after long thought. and by word of pope or archbisshop only.<br>
<br>
The cathilic church only removed the persons from priesthood. It is up to the Worldly laws to prosecute them for their crimes. this is not the job of the church, unless of course church and state in the US are one and the same like in alot of middle east countries. <br>
<br>
If this had not been a priest but some manager at a bank or some Librarian, The person would have lost his job too, same as the priest lost his job now. But the manager would still be able to have a bank account at that bank, and the librarian would still be allowed to lend books.<br>
<br>
So now you are all mad about catholic priests, well, I can start racists or other forms of discrimination to if I have to. I find it sicking that some people really do not think how they phrase there words and thoughts. Of course you can rant all you want, but do not start a hate campaign against a complete group based on the actions of one individual. <br>
<br>
The catholic church handles things the same was as it has done for over a thousend years. It is not something someone can understand without being a true believer, Like believing in the &quot;System&quot; . In their eyes the person confessed their sin and has to do their pennance. After that, it is over and done with for the part of the Human life the church takes care of, mainly the human soul. <br>
<br>
It is up to the Law, and I am talking about the state approved law, not the mob rule of pitchforks and flaming torches, to do the rest, prosecution and imprisonment. But nowadays people start getting their pitchforks and torches out to hang people alive whenever they have the chance, and then hang the neighbours too, and all people preaching for peace and reason, then they go on a rampage, ravage the town, rape the shops and burn down the women.<br>
<br>
Think a moment will you, before you start gathering the mob to put burning crosses in gardens, throw bricks through the glass windows of jewish shops, chop of the arms and legs of Hutu girls, blow up your car next to a israeli schoolbus, fly your plane into a building, throw a handgrenade in the local Gay bar on a saturday night, gangrape the 14 year old spanish girl from down the street, kill the nuns at the monastry because they also take care of the wounded rebel children, gund down your teachers and classmates because you only got a C minus, etc.<br>

the answer is simple. child molestation has a statute of limitations. and by the time most of these cases are reported (by children that have grown up and realize what happened) that period has passed, and the law can no longer do anything about it.<br>
<br>
the church has little control over it.  they can punish the offender, kick him out. whatever. but they cant send him to jail. and neither can the courts.  it has nothing to do with seperation of church and state.<br>
<br>
if your mad about priests not being sent to jail then you need to work at getting the law changed so there is no time limit on prosecuting offenders.  personally i dont see why there is a time limit on a problem that oftentimes isnt revealed for years.  it's not like a bank robbery. oftentimes no one even knows molestation occured till 20 years after the fact. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=teg>Teg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/17/02 2:38:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1207.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re:...</span><hr size=1> I'll start from the beginning.<br>

<br>
As far as I can tell, only one person has done that so far, and he was quite quick to apologise and explain hmiself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Tossing people out of church once was the the worst punishment (and in the eyes of every church still is) there can be for a religious man. It would mean total loss of community ties, eternal damnation in Hell, and no possible way ever again on any rest for the soul.<br>

<br>
I don't think being tossed out of the Church is that harsh anymore. In the 16th century excommunication meant be cut off from society as well as the Church, but in modern times, in most democratic countries at least, the state is independent of the Church, and being excommunicated wouldn't stop you from going down the road and buy a loaf of bread like it would have 500 years ago. The only real punishment that excommunication provides now is that you can't be a member as for church (as for eternal damnation in hell, if I believed in an afterlife I would tell you they'd already attained it).<br>
<br>
&quot;The cathilic church only removed the persons from priesthood. It is up to the Worldly laws to prosecute them for their crimes. this is not the job of the church, unless of course church and state in the US are one and the same like in alot of middle east countries.&quot;<br>
<br>
Granted, it's not the job of the Church to punish the offender, but it's also not the place of the Church to prevent the offenders punishment. He's still just as accountable for his crimes as he was before the Church forgave him, and the Church has no right to forgive him on behalf of the state.<br>
<br>
&quot;If this had not been a priest but some manager at a bank or some Librarian, The person would have lost his job too, same as the priest lost his job now. But the manager would still be able to have a bank account at that bank, and the librarian would still be allowed to lend books.&quot;<br>
<br>
No-ones trying to stop said priests worshipping god either. That is after-all what the Church is all about.<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course you can rant all you want, but do not start a hate campaign against a complete group based on the actions of one individual.&quot;<br>
<br>
Could you possibly exaggerate any more? The original post is about certain priests who molest children. It in no way blames the Church as an establishment, and it also seems completely rational to me. He's calling for the just punishment of criminals, last time I checked, that wasn't a hate campaign.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is not something someone can understand without being a true believer.&quot;<br>
<br>
That may be true, but it's also none of my concern. The Church is not the only entity the offender has wronged, and while it may forgive him, that doesn't bind others to. If I were a father, and my child was abused by a Catholic priest, would I be satisfied when the Church forgave him and he went unpunished? Hell no. Would you?<br>
<br>
&quot;Think a moment will you, before you start gathering the mob to put burning crosses in gardens, throw bricks through the glass windows of jewish shops, chop of the arms and legs of Hutu girls, blow up your car next to a israeli schoolbus, fly your plane into a building, throw a handgrenade in the local Gay bar on a saturday night, gangrape the 14 year old spanish girl from down the street, kill the nuns at the monastry because they also take care of the wounded rebel children, gund down your teachers and classmates because you only got a C minus, etc.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is probably the most insulting paragraph I've ever read. In just 7 lines, you managed to liken someone asking why criminals aren't punished for their crimes to 8 different racist/extreme/terrorist/mentally ill  people/groups. How you can logically derive bigotry from a call for justice is quite beyond me. That is of course unless you feel child abuse isn't a crime?<br>
<br>
In my opinion, these people deserve excommunication as well as imprisonment. Not only have they committed a disgusting crime, but they've broken an oath they took in the process. Unlike a bank manager or a librarian, they're breaking promises to commit their crimes, and in the eyes of the God they swore it against, if that isnt worthy of being cut off from the Church, what is?<br>

<br>
Secondly, if you looke at exactly how many cases we are dealing with you'd see there is a high rate of abuse in almost every other area of life then the church. <br>
<br>
Thirdly, the Catholic church is perfectly justified in asserting cannon authority over secular authority. If you claim to be christian at all, you seem to have missed that little clause about not judging others; that's God's place. <br>
<br>
Fourthy, what I find disgusting is the families of these victims. Can you honestly say if you're child were molested you would settle for quick cash? If so, shame on YOU. <br>
<br>
The very very very few priests who have done these acts more then likely have mental conditions that need to be addressed. My perfect solution would involve the priests being granted diplomatic immunity by the vatican (which can do so), and then having them recalled to Rome for trial. If the allegations are true, the priest would be offered forgiveness and then transfered to a monastic order to contemplate their wrongdoings. <br>
<br>
Now, as for the assorted sects of christianity in the US (baptists, methodists, etc) who are pointing fingers and feeling superior... don't. To me you are little more then heretics, who cannot even agree completely with each other. Those who do not understand the Catholic church do not understand christianity. The authority of christ was given to the apostles whom peter was chief among. Peter's authority, as the first pope, is transfered to each new pope who is infallible and inspired by the holy spirit. He who holds the Holy See and Throne of St. Peter is the earthly representative of God, and that which the Pope holds true shall be held true both in heaven and on earth. When Emperors supplicate themselves before your religious leaders and BEG forgiveness for their transgressions, when kings kneel for days in the snow pleading for papal mercy, and when the hand of god moves to protect your leaders, sanctify your church, or strike down the heretics of your religion, then you may be critical of the church. Until then, you are a heretic of the highest order.<br>

But that is just the problem here. According to the lore of the catholic church, they confessed their sins and saved their soul from damnation. This si the precise reason why in the late 1500's the church broke up in all kind of fractions. People were able to buy of the worst crimes.<br>

He is yes, but it is no longer a matter for the church. They handled the affairs their own, 50's styled, way. Now the church takes off their hands from the issue, it is up to the state to do the rest.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> No-ones trying to stop said priests worshipping god either. That is after-all what the Church is all about<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The person can worship god, but he will have to do it alone. he no longer has the support of the community, and he never again will.<br>

Of course not, no sane person would. But civilisation is build on the ruins left behind by the vengefull mobs. Nowadays punishment can be found through more decent ways then just venting your rage through violence and destruction. And that is what should be done here. And it is true that it is up to the Church to adjust to modern times and make the Priest confess his sins in public if this would benefit the public.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This is probably the most insulting paragraph I've ever read<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> Well thank you, I tried very hard to make it insulting, and also cover as many situation as I was able to in a short time. Each of these acts stirred up the emotions of almost everybody that heard of them.

But under the influence of others and because of the amplification due to this grouping, those acts were done still.<br>

There is nothing wrong with a call for justice, but sometimes there is something wrong with people comming to that call. There is much power in the man that has the ear of enraged people, I could have waited with my post and this thread had either died out, or it would have become a debate on punishment and who to punish when. I deceided to post now to prevent that. Already the first suggestion was made to Castrate priests the moment they accepted priesthood. Child abuse IS a crime, and nothing people that will suggest will make me think any other way about it.<br>
