I mean out of all the classes why did i chose a wizard? Oh yeah, thats right. The book that the game came with made it seem like wizards were the best class. It made it look like we could do the most damage, kill the most things, defend yourself when your getting attacked.. well after 52 f*cken lvls all ive got to say is WTF WAS VERANT THINKING WHEN THEY MADE THAT DISCRIPTION!!?? Why did they just go out and say &quot;Wizards do the most damage only by a few hundred damage, we die faster than you can say help and were as useful as a rock&quot;. Thats a much better discription than what they had. I mean at first i think being a wizard was cool because i never had to wait FIVE FREAKEN HOURS just to find a group and then 10 minutes into the group you say you have to camp! I have almost quit eq a few times already but if it wasnt for my friends and me keep on constantly thinking &quot;Hey if i wait a little more then eventually verant will fix wizards&quot;. What did verant do to 'help' wizards? They gave us o kelis flickering flame. Like im gonna be wanted in groups just so i can blow 115 mana on all of the tanks just to give them a 5 point ds. Then after the class balancing thing verANT had a chance to fix wizards, but no. What did they do? They gave us bane spells! Woopie 2k unresistable damage ON SELECT FEW VELIOUS MOBS. And better yet they cost a peridot per cast! To me 11pp for 2k damage is ok but all the mobs you can use the bane spells on have more than 200k hp!! WOOT if i had 2400 mana at lvl 60 then i could do 12k damage to it!! If i dont get killed after my first 3 casts!! <br>

I never read much into the &quot;masters of magical damage&quot; thing anyway.<br>
<br>
My husband has been playing EQ since Phase 3 or 4 Beta (can't remember at the moment) and his very first character was a wizzie he didn't get past level 12. His main is a Barb Shammie, and he's very happy with this class. (Don't ever ask him to help you create a character tho, he thinks everyone should be a tank... god the int points I wasted!)<br>
<br>
He tells me that when wizards were first created, at the very beginning of the game, the vision for them was different from how the class has evolved.  They were much more powerful much earlier in the game back then.  At low levels it was very hard for a wizard to outlive the agro it created, so many players quit playing them.<br>
<br>
Many wizards, from what I can see here, feel like we need to come out of the box creating massive destruction.  We are seekers of knowledge.  Anything you do is based on basics you learned at the very beginning, then repeating those basics over and over until it's second nature.  You learn and you move on to something new.  Each time you learn something new, you build upon the foundation of basics.<br>
<br>
The damage I create now is fine with me.  I try to time my casts so I dont cause the mob to agro to me as I have the HP of a gnat.  If it is all going to hell in a handbasket then I am usually the last one standing, chain casting as I go down.  Wizzies are there to help bring the mob down. We do cause alot of damage.  And, we are usually the killing blow.<br>
<br>
You didn't make a mistake.  You thought you'd get an easy ride and realized that wizards are all about learning. <p>Severine <BR>

<br>
But the thing that we learn, and learn till playing a wizard is second nature is probably the thing that bugs me the most. I mean what do we do? During a fight... Hit assist hotkey or f8, wait till mob is 60% hp, stand up, slam that ice comet/rend/lure of frost spell depeneding on what kind of mob was pulled, then sit down. Thats all we do. Almost other classes all do the same thing too, clerics stand up to heal, tanks stand up to taunt that mob and do damage to it or pull, chanters mez adds and clarity/haste, etc. Thats just why im so sick of this game. After the first few lvls you start getting the hang of the game, thinking at higher lvls itll be cooler. Its not. Im still doing the same thing i did back when i was lvl 18. All other classes are doing the same thing. <br>
<br>
That would be fine if theyre were actually real quests to do, or roleplaying, etc. But there isnt. All of the quests are mostly crap rewards that you can buy something 5x better with the money you could of made doing that quest. <br>
<br>
Maybe i wouldn't feel this way if i didnt have to wait 5 hours to find a group in Karnors or seb. &lt;Shrug&gt; After a while eq just starts getting boring, no matter how many twinks you make, how mANY different servers you start new chars on, itll all just be the same. Just random hack and slash to lvl and wait for your friedns to get on so you can transfer twink stuff. Nothing more.<br>
<br>
But im not going to give up this easily... my only twink is a lvl 22 monk, really fun to play, esp with 20pt hp regen permently =). But i rarely play him because i keep thinking &quot;gotta hit 60&quot; so im determined to not quit eq untill i drop dead of bordom or shadowbane/ao turns out to be much more fun that eq <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><body link="#000000" vlink="#000000" alink="#000000">

<br>
Sorry - but I find this quite humorous. <br>
<br>
I too started a Wizard based on the book when you got the game and since I have mainly played this type of class whenver I used to play D&amp;D, I felt confident that I had the mindset to play a Wizard with this game.<br>
<br>
I play a Human 51 Wizard. It is not easy. I am proud that I made it to level 51 so far. Will I go further - who knows.<br>
<br>
What I should draw attention to is that it appears that those that post on this message board that say they are &quot;happy&quot; with their Wizards say so because they come from large or UBER guilds and HAVE the resources to further themselves. They have ALL of the latest trinkets and if they need to get something - have the numbers in their guild families to be able to pull it off. Sure it may take some politicing within their guild to go to these places, but it is far easier. It that is all I had to do within my guild - I would be doing backflips through the Dreadlands.<br>
<br>
Face it - playing a Wizard is not a walk in the park. It is a continual learning experience. But once you get to 50, if you do not have the resources to aid you (large/UBER guild) you really are looking at a solo life should you want to progress further. Either that - or waiting for friends or pick groups at numerous zones around the land.<br>
<br>
The main issue is time. If you have ample hours and can play 6+ hours a day - sure - you will be happy with your Wizard and your UBER guild becuase you have folks that can aid you in getting the latest equipment and toys.<br>
<br>
Those of us that cannot play oodles of hours and tried, but could not get into larger guilds really have no choices or options or resources at our dispopsal.<br>
<br>
It's not that we HATE playing a Wizard, we love it, we are good at it, but the resources that are needed to support our class ONLY exist within a large/UBER guild. To have invested this much time and energy into a class only to be struck down post 50, due to lack of resources is pretty sad. This shows that there is something definately wrong with teh game mechanics.<br>
<br>
If you belong to one of these guilds and have access and opportunity to be able to get to obtain good equipment it can be difficult to see why folks are not happy with the class as you ASSUME that everyone can get the stuff you can. You may not fully understand why they rant and rave as you do not have the problems that they do.<br>
<br>
Well - hate to break it to you - but not everyone is as fortunate as you.<br>
<br>
Take me for instance. I am a casual player. I can play about 3 hours a day if I want to keep my marriage and good job. I belong to a small family guild and they are gradually leveling and getting to the point where we can start to think of doing larger things. The items that are needed at my level require multiple groups and a great deal of coordination as we cannot tackle these with just my guild. We would have to involve brother or sister guilds. A good example is the Phenocryst Focus. I am to the point in the quest of spawning the giants and obtaining the medallions. Can I do that?  Heck no. We do not have enough melee classes in our guild in order for us to take this on. So - I have basically given up on the quest as the only way I could possibly take it on is to organize my guild in addition to begging other guilds with high level melee classes to aid my cause. Either that or spend tons of money to hire mercenaries to aid me in defeating the giants. Money that I simply do not have.<br>
<br>
I have read others posts about &quot;oh how easy it is...&quot;. but you really do not understand what folks in small/middle sized guilds have to go through which you take for granted on a daily basis. Equipment like this is far out of reach for us and to throw the issue of &quot;well - not much is needed for balance&quot; is a mockery of anyone that is not in your position. I will kindly remind you that not everyone is or can get into an UBER guild. Not everyone is lucky or fortunate to be able to go to the places and see the things you can. Post 50 game sucks for mid to small guilds. Folks in this playstyle pattern have NO options with the exception of soloing or waiting several hours just to get the chance of a group in a dungeon where they can either get items or exp.<br>
<br>
It is easy to sit back in your chair and say that you put in XXX hours and that if you want these items you have to as well. What this does is put up a barrier that folks cannot overcome due to not being able to commit that much to this game. It is either that or leave. That is now the choice.<br>
<br>
Sure - I can start another class and level them up - but you know - irregardless of which class I choose - even one of the golden 3 - Cleric, Warrior, Enchanter, I know that when I hit 50, I will hit that wall again unless Verant decides to do something for those of us that cannot go further.<br>
<br>
The issue then becomes when do I decide that I want to give up on my investment in this game. If VI leaves things as it is, most folks in the smaller guilds will leave as the gap between them and the UBERs grows further and further apart. They have no reason to stay. The only reasons are their friends and the time investment in the char they have taken to 50. Mudflation adds to the problems for yournger casters as they find that even pre50, they become obsolete as UBERs twink out thier fledglings and quickly level themselves.<br>
<br>
Can you tell this is a hot button for me?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
One thing I think would make a difference and that is one of two things. <br>
<br>
1) VI decides to make some relevant changes. (not gems II)<br>
2) The possibility that UBER guilds will get more involved with their community.<br>
<br>
With #2, I have NEVER in all my time playing seen any UBER guilds hold events on my server. Never have I seen them come down off their godly mountains and mingle with the normal folks and actually do something to help those in need. <br>
<br>
Fact is most folks never have the chance to meet these people as they are always in places we cannot ever get to. I have met some and find they seem like nice enough people. Sure there are jerks in every society, but for the most part my interactions have been pleasant. It would be just nice to see them and actually have them do something for their community. <br>
<br>
Just like in real life, folks with power and influence do charity work and aid the rest of the people in their society. But I do not see these guilds helping anyone but themselves. <br>
<br>
So - think of this as a challenge! UBER guilds - I challenge you do work within your communities. Create an event and sponsor smaller guilds or people on your servers. Come down off your holy mountians and spend a day in our shoes. You may find it boring, but it will help bridge the bond and change the attitudes of your fellow Norrathians concerning you for the good. Folks will respect you - the respect you feel you deserve, but not out of envy, out of friendship. <br>
<br>
Without interaction with us, the attitude towards your guilds will only gets worse as VI continues to try and keep up the programming for your playstyle to the detriment of everyone else. Eventually, we will leave out of frustration and resentment leaving only new subscribers and you on the server.

Sorry to hear that you're at a roadblock bro. The only thing I can do with you is empathize. It's tough when you get up there in levels, and the gear that would be an improvent over your current setup is almos unobtainable due to time and guild resources (or lack thereof). <br>
<br>
If you see this post, drop me an email bro. While you know I like the Wyrms, I can understand where you're coming from in your frustration.<br>
