I've heard she can spawn from 1 AM to 4 AM, but I've just seen 2 AM.  She was much tougher the time she had the stone.  You NEED NOT clear anything.  NOTHING is her placeholder.  She is a COMPLETELY random spawn.  I did read that there are 4 spawn points in total for her; I can vouch for only 2 of them.<br><br>When she had it, I was sitting facing the west, was thinking about logging, stood up, turned, and there she was, right in the middle of the ruins.

You could go insane.<br><br>I'm guessing at this, but I believe that every night there's X probability that Pyzjn will spawn with Y probability of having the stone.  Also, each night is mutually independent of another, meaning that if she hasn't spawned for 100 nights in a row, there's still X probability she will spawn the following night.  There's not a HIGHER chance she'll spawn just because she's been on a prolonged vacation.  Akin to getting 100 heads when flipping a coin.  There's still a 50% chance of getting a head on the next flip.<br><br>Now, obviously, knowing X and Y would be good.  If I were to guess, I would say X is 10% and Y is 5-10%.  This means that the chance of her being there WITH the stone on any given night is 0.5-1% (1 in 100 to 1 in 200).  That's why this is the EQ lottery.<br><br>My advice would be to not camp the spawn, but ocassionally give the ruins a visit now and again.  Also, do this when the servers are less populated (between 3 AM and 7 AM).  Your chances do not increase when you sit there through 10 nights as opposed to just visiting the ruins 10 separate times. <p>Xaxia<BR>Erudite Wizardess<BR>22th Season</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxaxia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaxia</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://members.prestige.net/chosenofnorrath/images/xaxia.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> Edited by: 9/15/00 6:54:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usindarius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sindarius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/16/00 9:28:57 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pyzjn Quest (Qhills)</span><hr size=1> I think there's a PH somewhere....I spent one week before i got my first GBS. there is a a bear that roams and stops at pyz's spwan point every once and a while and stays there...also....wierd pattern i noticed one time was when i killed varsoon one night the next night pyz spawned that happened 3 times in a row.

Ok.. this is prolly going to be long, so bear with me.<br><br>One of the previous posters was correct in saying that there is a *LOT* of misinformation regarding that little gnome necro.  The one thing that I don't understand is why people think she is any different of a spawn than any other in the game.<br><br>I have killed her roughly 16 times, getting myself 3 GBSs.  I have spent upwards of 100 hours in QHills, camping her spawn. <br><br>Anyway...<br><br>I have heard a lot of people say that you need to kill Scruffy and Tovax to get Pyzjn to spawn.  No way.  Scruffy spawns instead of Tovax during the day.  I am totally convinced that Killing Tovax has *nothing* to do with whether Pyzjn spawns or not.  In fact, hes been up when she was.  <br><br>Varsoon is also not a PH, in fact, in my experience he is rarer than Pyzjn is.  Like I said, I have killed Pyzjn about 16 times.  I have only seen Varsoon about 4.<br><br>Also, regarding the whole PH thing.  Someone above said that they believe that she is a totally random spawn, and has no PHs.  Not to refute what they are saying, but I have to disagree.  Like I said, I am a firm believer that she is just like any other spawn in the game.  Namely, she is on a spawn list for a couple locations in the zone.  Each of these lists have a certain % for each MoB on that list to spawn.  Just like the AM in lguk, Djarn in SolB, etc.. etc.  Only difference here is that she is on more than one list, and they happen to be wanderers.  This is why people get some crazy ideas about her, because besides the ruins, not too many people ( if any ) know where else she can spawn.  So, if she doesn't spawn, killing what did will reset the spawn and give her another chance to pop ( hence PHs ).  It is quite obvious though that she will only spawn if it is during a certain time frame.  i.e.  6pm - 6am or whatever.<br><br>I am almost certain that she can spawn in 1 of 5 places.  I believe this for one reason.  I have seen her spawn at the ruins, as well as following 4 different paths to them.  If you are at the ruins, facing towards the lake where Hadden spawns, you'll see that rocky hill where trash walks down.  I have seen her come down that hill 3 different ways.  Each of them more than once as well, so I believe them to be set paths.  If you watch mangy rats during the day, they follow these paths that she would take.  Also, at night, if you see any wandering Dread Corpses, Putrids, or regular Skellys.. they follow these same 3 paths as well.  To me, this is another reason why I think those wanderers are the actually PHs.  One of those paths starts near the road heading towards Hadden, like a previous poster said.  The other coming from Surefall starts at the little tree right next to the road in front of the SF zone where the guards are standing.  I have seen her standing here.  I am assuming she had just spawned because as I was running to her a Dr00d came zipping past me with Spirt of Cheetah in full effect, no doubt she had just appeared on his tracking list.  Needless to say, I didn't get that kill.  No stone dropped, so it was ok with me =)   The forth spawn is to the left of the ruins ( again, if you are facing out towards the lake ).  One time coming down the hill, heading to the ruins, I saw her running.  She stopped, cast grim aura and summoned a pet.  Tovax does the same thing after he spawns behind that guard shack.  I am fairly convinced she had just spawned as well.  After that, she took about 2 more steps towards the ruins in the amount of time my DD took to go off =)<br><br>My advice to those that want to camp her, especially if you have competition for the kill, is to stay on the rocky hill in front of the ruins.  Kill all the trash that comes down, and she will eventually spawn for you.  If a dread corpse spawns in the middle of the ruins, where the giant rat or grizzly bear sits in the day time, kill that too.  Pyzjn will spawn in that spot if she pops at the ruins.<br><br>Also, load up your lv8 ice DD and your lv16 fire DD.  Lv8 DD is enough to kill any of the small stuff like Dec skellys, bats, fire beetles etc.  Lv16 DD will work for wolves and the larger bats.  The most important thing if you have competition though, Pyzjn as about 160hp.  Lv16 DD does 110, which is more than enough to secure looting rights and casts pretty fast, should you need to cast faster than that other person that is there =)<br><br>Oh, and another thing.  As to what times of the day she will spawn.  Out of those 16 spawns, earliest was 11pm, latest was 4am at the times I found and killed her.<br><br><br>Hope this helps...<br><br>Scherazade Sama<br>House of X'zzt<br>Lv47 wizard of Rallos Zek<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uscherazadesama.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Scherazade Sama</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/21/00 3:18:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pyzjn Quest (Qhills)</span><hr size=1> There is actually a couple great posts on Pyzjn titled &quot;Final Thoughts&quot; by Lividian of the 7th Hammer located here:<br><br><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3763">eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=3763</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br><br>Another good one on that page is by an anon, but titled &quot;Info&quot;<br><br>Lots of the rest is trash though.. just read this stuff.

It seems that most people are very &quot;hush hush&quot; about her to keep the price of the GBS sky-high.  Very annoying.<br><br>Anyway, I admit that you're technically right about the PH idea.

As for a purely hypothetical example, take the ruins spawn.  Probabilities of spawn are (pure guesses):<br><br>Dread    - 42.5%<br>Putrid   - 37.0%<br>Skeleton - 20.0%<br>Pyzjn    -  0.4%<br>Varsoon  -  0.1%<br><br>So, on average, for every 106 dreads you kill (42.5/0.4), you will get Pyzjn once.  So, there is not one PH, but many.  Other spawn points (not ruins) have the bear, rat, etc.  Because she is so rare, it's absolute luck if you get her or not.  Killing these PHs may speed up the process, but you could still be here for 100's hours on end with nothing to show for.  Or you could just log in with her smiling at you (or with you smiling afterwards).<br><br>I agree that Varsoon is rarer than Pyzjn.  I have yet to see him once, and I've seen Pyzjn 4 times now.<br><br>I haven't sought after this item for long, so it's good to see an experienced player post good information on it.<br><br>By the way, are 3 GBSs on RZ a record?! <p>Xaxia<BR>Erudite Wizardess<BR>22nd Season</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=celestialstarfire>Celestial Starfire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/21/00 1:47:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> This item is SO over rated</span><hr size=1> For Wizards this item is so over Rated...

There's a time to kill her if you want to be sure to get a GBS, and that is *not* when she's just standing around or walking around.  If you kill her then, the GBS is just random loot.<br><br>Here's another hint: Varsoon is involved.  Don't kill him hoping he is a placeholder.<br><br>A final hint: the GBS isn't just some random cool item Verant thought of.  It's part of a story.  You can find out the story from someone in Befallen.  If you know the story, the above hints will make a lot of sense.<br><br>OK, one more hint: some NPCs talk to other NPCs.<br><br>Keep in mind that Qeynos and Qeynos Hills were among the earliest zones Verant designed.
