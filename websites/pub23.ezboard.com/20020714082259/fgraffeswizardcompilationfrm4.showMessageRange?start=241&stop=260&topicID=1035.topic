Apples and oranges. The government cannot legislate whether a healthy diet can have an effect on your weight and lifestyle one way or the other. It can legislate the legality of certain methods of self defense.<br>

I think that you do have a valid point about FK's debating style.  I'm reasonably confident that there's a few lines from him/her/it in this (or another) thread in which he/she/it admits to smiling smugly in face to face arguments and enjoys exposing flawed debating styles.  I'm pressed for time or I'd find the quote myself.  Maybe when I have a bit more time...<br>
<br>
In the end, I simply favor great logical consistency and debate style over flawless civility.  I try to use both, but I understand that not all people will.  That just elicits a big shrug from me, unless the person is grossly rude, which I don't think FK has been.<br>
<br>
I don't think that FK will be offended by this mild critique, since I think I have a good handle on his/her/its basic personality.

No you got it spot on. Causation is too hard to prove. My burden is lesser. The people proposing gun control because it will reduce crime do have to show causation though. If not causation at a minimum strong empirical evidence. The statistics blow either of those out of the water.<br>

Lie. I did not insult Australia. I suggested that if Aurianne believed the US could do better than Australia with gun control with wide open borders than Australia that WOULD be an insult to Australia. Personally I am quite sure they are doing as good a job at gun control as can be done, and they had the perfect environment to try it with as insulated borders as can be imagined. That they are failing is not due to ineptness but due to the impossibility of what they are attempting. Someone had to try it, glad it was them and not us though.<br>

In any event if trigger locks are to prevent suicide then should we not also protect people from all other methods? For myself I would certainly OD on a nice narcotic.

<br>
Trigger locks for safety &amp; public good (is to) drilling for oil in some refuge to open up alternative fossil fuel sources, which may have some public good.<br>
<br>
The two don't correlate.  There is no private safety component to drilling for oil in an Alaska wildlife refuge.  Thus the straw man fallacy.  My position is not whether stopgap measures in general are good or bad.  My position is that trigger locks should go out the door when guns are sold and should be used whenever said gun is in storage.  You have already agreed with me on this.<br>
<br>
As far as the rest goes, I think you are mixing my arguments with Liquid's.  Let's review my posts.<br>
<br>
Extended background checks probably won't do much for getting handguns out of the black market.  Having exams to get firearms may be unpractical.  Trigger locks are goooood things, and should be required on all stored weapons.<br>
<br>
Yah, trigger locks should be required on all stored weapons, even if you don't have a kid.<br>
<br>
Rebuttal regarding points you'd made on child locks, asking for clarification in some places that I didn't see enough logic in.  Noting that Judge Dredd weapons don't exist and there's no timeline on them existing.<br>
<br>
Noted a flaw in logic and that you are a good debater who probably has no need for the threats and bravado you occasionally use.  Pointed out that statistics can be used on all sides.  I think this is where you started thinking I was preaching disarming the population.<br>
<br>
Offered information on ad hominem.  Made mention of not wanting to waste time in a statistics swap session and noted that after you offered statistics you did not draw a conclusion from them.  Restated my position that I believe trigger locks are relevant.  Offered a link to research and asked what it was you wanted researched.  Provided general utilitarian stance on benefits of trigger locks and noted that not everyone will agree.  Pointed out another logic flaw.<br>
<br>
Touched on a point Liquid was trying to make and offered a possible PhD thesis to a future social studies major.<br>
<br>
Restated my position on trigger locks.<br>
<br>
This post.<br>
<br>
I do think there are too many unaccounted or sloppily protected weapons in this country and that the black market has too steady a flow of firearms, but that's not what I'm working on here.  Look to Liquid for arguments on restricting firearms.<br>

NOTE you are NOT using straw man either because you are actually substituting values in logic that I used. This is technically proper. (as was my rebuttal) It is still flawed but for other reasons.

One you ignored the _rest_ of my case, and two the general case of stopgap measures being justified merely because no perfect solution exists is not sound, which is all I was pointing out.

If the state is obliged to protect us from suicide then it should be obliged to protect us from all the ways we can suicide.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Providing marginal protection from teen suicide by making stored guns less accessable is only one reason to be in favor of trigger locks on stored weapons, a position which you support.  Protection against accidental discharge is another reason.  Refer back to my brief discourse on Utilitarianism.  Deterring escalating domestic quarrels is another.  There are many.  But since we're in agreement in general on trigger locks there is no need to brainstorm on what all those reasons may be.<br>

My answer was that I am not addressing whether stopgap measures in general are good or bad.  Sorry, but I'm not going to let you redirect me that easily.  This is not a debate on the validity of 'stopgap' measures.  Have a little fire, Scarecrow <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Are you saying that although there is a reasonable measure available right now to make stored firearms safer, a measure you agree with, that it is better to wait for a 'more reasonable' solution that may or may not show itself at some point in the future?

Trigger locks are not your perfect solution, because biometric weapons, which don't exist, are better, making trigger locks a stop-gap measure<br>

Last but not least, you already agreed to 'compromise' and agree with my point.  The fact that the 'common ground' I cited above, which you agreed with, was my initial position is irrelevant.

5. In Canada, which people tend to think is a free country, and where guns are also prohibited (at least around the populated areas), the government prohibits &quot;hate speech&quot;, which really amounts to anything that doesnt agree with the governments views on things.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now if we change it to: &quot;In USA, which people tend to think is a free country&quot;. Would you consider this as an insult?<br>
<br>
Now if I said this as a foreigner, would you then consider this as an insult?<br>
<br>
I suppose I misunderstood you about your remark on Australia. I am sorry. (However, given your &quot;smugly&quot; debate style you really have to excuse me on that.)<br>
<br>
However, it is quite clear that you provided false evidence on the crime rate increase. There is really no weasel out of this one.<br>
<br>
At best, you can only claim that gun control did nothing to reduce crime. But saying it dramatically increased the crime rate is just outrages. I know you would ask me to provide evidence so here you are: <br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/research/hmonitor/stats/hvr.html">Australian Homicide Rate</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
That is an official Australian government site. So I suppose you can not brush it off as just &quot;ONE page from gun grabbers&quot;.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, could we please know where do you come up with all your information such as your original claim on Australia? Could I adopt your own style and simply brush it off as pro gun propaganda?<br>
<br>
<br>
About logic: I suppose you are extremely good at logic. (of course, that's your unsupported claim, we would have to ask you to back it up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Now it seem to be a logical claim that more gun in circulation might deter crime. (Again I am not sure how are you going to prove this point with real life data.)<br>
<br>
Why is it so illogical that less gun in circulation would result in less gun related death? (Sure, we can't prove this with real life data.) <br>
<br>
So your logic basically only apply to argument that benefit you?<br>
<br>
Lastly about opinion: Can anyone's opinion be quite wrong? I suppose if your opinion is different from mine, than it is quite wrong? This sentiment itself is what is wrong. I suppose majority of the wars started because people do not agree with each other? (Please don't ask me to pull statistic out for this one.)<br>
<br>
I did not initially flame you for your opinion on gun control, I flamed you because I think you were rude.<br>

It's amazing how you can twist the figure to whatever way you want. <br>
<br>
Please refer to this link:<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/facts/2001/sec3.html#assault">Crime Statistic</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Go down to figure 33.<br>
<br>
The gun ban started in 1997, now if you have a look at 1995- 1996 figure. <br>
<br>
Why did it increase? the criminal knew before hand that the guns are going to be collected in 2 year and started their activity early?<br>
<br>
For unarmed robbery, it was an upward trend from 1995 to 1997. It peaked in 1997 to about 1200 level and since stayed there.<br>
<br>
For armed robbery, it was an upward trend from 1995 to 1998.<br>
Peaked at about 1100 and since drop to about 800 level.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now is you claim that &quot;ARMED&quot; crime rate increased dramatically since the 1997 gun ban. Is that even remotely true?<br>
<br>
It looks more like that it was an increasing trend but stablized (for unarmed) and dropped (for armed) since the gun ban.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, why is it that you can not provide the link for me in the first place? Or like I said, you used pro gun web site exculsively for your quote?<br>
<br>
(note: assault seem to keep on increasing stablely. Like I said, at most you can only claim that gun control did nothing. Where did it DRAMATICALLY increase ARMED crime rate?)<br>
