Idiot:  HI CAN U TP ME PLZ<br>
<br>
(90% of the time I will just ignore these.  This time, however, I decide to be nice.)<br>
<br>
Me:  Yeah, but only if you can spell &quot;you&quot; and &quot;please&quot; correctly.<br>
<br>
(Now, most people at this point apologize and rephrase their request with correct spelling.  And why shouldn't they?  They are getting a free port out of the deal.)<br>
<br>
Idiot:  Oh, you don't like shorthand, huh?<br>
<br>

<br>
Idiot:  WELL THEN FUCK U I WILL SPEL STYUFF HOWERVER I WANT<br>
<br>
Me:  Allrighty then.<br>

/ignore idiot<br>
<br>
Idiot then continued to wander around the zone in for another 20 minutes before I left, presumably still looking for a port.<br>
<br>
Amazing.  All he had to do was type &quot;you&quot; and &quot;please&quot; and I would have ported him for free.  But no, he was just too proud of his d00dsp33k to allow it.<br>

People never cease to amaze me.</span><hr size=1> I probably met the dumbest player yesterday on Tribunal that I still laugh when I think of it. I'm helping a friend PL at the aviaks in SK when there's a /ooc for a TP to WC, and I wasn't doing anything that consisted in mana use per say, I decided to help him. It went something like this<br>
<br>
Sitting down and medding a DE necro runs up to me, and my friend.<br>
<br>
Clueless_01: /ooc Looking for TP to WC.<br>
(at this point he runs off)<br>
(5 minutes goes by)<br>
<br>
Clueless_01: /ooc Looking for TP to WC.<br>
Me: /ooc Come to Aviaks and I'll TL you.<br>
Clueless_01: /ooc Umm where are the Aviaks<br>
me: /ooc You were just there, you know the thing with the birdies!!<br>
Clueless_01: /ooc oh ok... so you'll TP me?<br>
Me: /ooc I'll TL you to WC yes<br>
Clueless_01: /ooc But you can't TL me, I'm a necro!<br>
Me: /ooc ?? So? what does that have to do with anything?<br>
Clueless_01: /ooc I'm a necro, you can't TL me<br>
Me: /ooc You're kidding right? TL is the same as TP except I don't have to go to WC with you.<br>
Clueless_01: /ooc Oh, umm ok, but you can't TL.<br>
<br>
(at this point he's found me and he's standing right in front of me, and he can't tell i'm a wizard. As if the robe, Staff of the Wheel, etc.. etc.. not to mention I have /role off so it says Level 45 Wizard)<br>
<br>
Me: /ooc Yes I can, how about you do a /who all Psihala<br>
Clueless_01: /ooc oh ummm <br>
Me: /ooc What does it say beside my name, come on, don't be shy.<br>
Clueless_01: /ooc It says Wizard<br>
<br>
(at this time, all 20 other people in the zone are in tears from laughing)<br>
<br>
Me: /invite Clueless_01<br>
<br>
Me: /ooc Well tell everyone by now, cause they sure will remember you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Clueless_01: /g how rude<br>
<br>
Finally I gave up and TL him back to Nek, cause just as the WC spell was going to go off, he wants to go to Nek. I should start a 'dumb' list beside my 'no port' list. Just so I can remember their names and laugh some more.<br>

I had a friend in the zone check him out to make sure he was for real... even contacted his guildmates to find out if he was really as stupid as he appeared.<br>
<br>
I am in SF and this person is in Butcher...<br>
<br>
Mondo_Stupid tells you:  Can you port me to bind?<br>
I tell Mondo_Stupid:  Uhm sure I am medding close to the zone.<br>
<br>
(Im figuring that it's a person who may not speak english that well, benefit of the doubt kinda thing)<br>
<br>
Mondo_Stupid tells you:  Uh, zone?  what zone?<br>
I tell Mondo_Stupid: The BW zone... you cant miss me, Im the high elf with orange hands<br>
<br>
 (remember to always flash your Ixi gloves, people will think you're juggling tangerines)<br>
<br>
Mondo_Stupid tells you:  Where is BW?<br>
<br>
(Ok I stop here and do a /who and find Mondo_Stupid is in butcher)<br>
<br>
I tell Mondo_Stupid: Sorry friend, I am no where near you.  Maybe you can find someone in GFay to TL you to bind.<br>
<br>
( A few minutes go by and I am blissfully nuking mobs in SF)<br>
<br>
Mondo_Stupid tells you:  Can you port me to bind?<br>
I tell Mondo_Stupid:  Sorry Friend, I'm a continent away, find someone in Gfay to TL you.  Good Journey.<br>
Mondo_Stupid tells you: I really need a port to bind... I need to auction some stuff, Im encumbered.<br>
I tell Mondo_Stupid:  Look, I can't help you I am in Skyfire on Kunark... where are you bound?<br>
Mondo_Stupid tells you:  GFay<br>
<br>
(OK at this point I am thinking this is someone pulling my leg, knowing how I despise people who pester me for ports, so I start checking him out... I have a guildmate in the zone and he tells me the idiot is sitting by the water looking as clueless as he sounds.  I then as several friends of mine in his guild if he's for real and they confirm my suspicions that his mother and father were first cousins or brother and sister)<br>
<br>
Mondo_Stupid tells you: Can you port me to bind?<br>
<br>
(By this time I am laughing so hard and my entire guild with me, and I think his guild at him that I can't stand it.  I actually fell halfway out of my comfy chair.)<br>
<br>
I tell Mondo_Stupid:  I'm really sorry I cant help you, maybe someone in your guild can.  I hope you get to where you're going.<br>
Mondo_Stupid tells you: Nobody in my guild has Port to Bind, they already told me.<br>
<br>
(At his point Im in hysterics and my children did set the date for the committment hearing... so I beg my friends in his guild to have mercy on me...)<br>
<br>
Mondo_Stupid tells you: oh NM someone just got the spell in a lotto and can port me... thanks<br>
<br>
At this point a druid ported a wizard to BB, they picked up the moron and the wizard ported him to GFay.  They told me they hadn't had so much fun since the necro &quot;Sow me dude&quot; thing.  I told them that the guy needed real help and suggested Hukt of Foniz werkt 4 me. <p><table border="3" cellpadding="2" bgcolor="#000000" width="472">

The idiot was in North Karana and expected me to port him to Great Divide, no promise of money for going out of my way, no nothing.  I've been getting more and more like this, and we arn't talking friends, or guild members, we are talking about level 25 people who I've never seen or even talked to before.<br>
<br>
Next time, I'll tell the person I'll port them, but since I'm not in the same zone as they are, it will cost them 500 plat just for me to port to where they are at to port them, but it will be free after that.  <br>

you tell stupid_dorf01: &quot;neither do I.&quot;<br>
stupid_dorf01 tells you: &quot;come on it will only take a sec&quot;<br>
you tell stupid_dorf01: &quot;so you want me to port you to gfay, then run back here to finish what I am doing, just so you don't have to make the exact same run I will have to if I port you?&quot;<br>
stupid_dorf01 tells you: &quot;i will give you 10pp&quot;<br>

Idiot_10000 tells you &quot;Hi, can you TL me plz&quot;<br>
You tell Idiot_10000 &quot;sorry, can't now&quot;<br>
Idiot_10000 tells you &quot;Please, I will donate&quot;<br>
You tell Idiot_10000 &quot;sorry, in full group and we are fighting&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;a few minutes pass and Idiot_10000 is standing right in front of me now&gt;<br>
<br>
Idiot_10000 tells you &quot;Hi, can you TL me plz&quot;<br>
You say &quot;sorry, no&quot;<br>
You tell your group &quot;afk one min, someone at door&quot;<br>
Idiot_10000 tells you &quot;Can't someone drop from your group for just a few seconds so you can TL me?&quot;<br>
Idiot_10000 tells you &quot;?&quot;<br>
You tell your group &quot;back&quot;<br>
Idiot_10000 tells you &quot;why won't you TL me?&quot;<br>
You tell Idiot_10000 &quot;I already told you 3 times, i am fighting, am group leader, group is full, and plus I'm MLing.  I am not going to TL you.  get it from someone else&quot;<br>
Idiot_10000 tells you &quot;I've never met such a dumb wizard that can't TL&quot;<br>
<br>
Up to this point I had been patiently and politely telling him no.  But that crap pissed me off.<br>
<br>
You tell Idiot_10000 &quot;I am GROUPED and FIGHTING!&quot;<br>
Idiot_10000 tells you &quot;then why were you just sitting there for a couple minutes not doing anything?&quot;<br>
You tell Idiot_10000 &quot;because I had to go AFK!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Then he kept trying to insult me by telling me I don't know how to port, TL, play a wiz.<br>
<br>
You tell Idiot_10000 &quot;why don't you WALK to GD and ask for a port at the portal???  There are porters going in and out of there constantly!&quot;<br>
Idiot_10000 &quot;I just came from there&quot;<br>
<br>
???  Zone into VL to get a port??? Ok, if a wiz is at the zone and LFG, no biggie...<br>
<br>
Anyways a few minutes went by, then the BEST part came:<br>
<br>
Idiot_10000 tells you &quot;Nevermind anymore, I found someone to port me since you don't know how to.  I got a druid to port back to GD, walk to VL and give me a port.&quot;<br>
You tell Idiot_10000 &quot;You mean you can't even run to the damn PORTAL RING?  You're going to make him come get you???&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point dead silence and never heard from him again.  Yet.<br>
<br>
OMFG!  This guy is the FIRST and only member of my IDIOT ASSHOLE DO NOT PORT LIST, which I swore I would never start...<br>
<br>
Note:  I do try and port peeps all the time if I'm available.  If I can't I politely tell them no.  Maybe I should just go /role and never port non-guild or non-friends ever again... <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=25290" target="Callaar">Callaar Chanecaaster</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=alphie>Alphie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/20/01 3:02:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> People never cease to amaze me</span><hr size=1> My favourite solution for those who won't go away is a nice TL to tox. =)  You won't believe how many click ok before reading /grin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uorvie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Orvie</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/21/01 12:46:47 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: People never cease to amaze me</span><hr size=1> I was just thinking...<br>
You know what would fix 99% of the problems we have with rude interactions from complete strangers that seem to think we exist to serve them?<br>
<br>
/ignore is a hindsight command, and doesn't prevent interruptions in play, so a better command is needed.<br>
<br>
Here's two new commands.<br>
<br>
/authorize [playername]<br>
/authorizemode [on/off]<br>
<br>
Simple reversal of the /ignore command, now you have to be on the list when the mode is active or the /tell is filtered out.<br>
<br>
There, now if you think it's unfair to be forced into /role or /anon because your friends won't be able to see where you are, you have a solution.<br>
<br>
<br>
OK, enough fantasizing...but it's really a shame that the playerbase general attitude has reached the point where something like this is needed.<br>
<br>
I try not to use /role or /anon for the exact reasons mentioned above, and in many areas during peak hours I am so horridly spammed by /tells when I enter a zone that I can't even use &quot;R&quot; to reply before getting another /tell from someone else.<br>
<br>
I'm making a wish here:<br>
 &quot;Please, oh PLEASE let all the little selfish twits run in droves to play DAoC and vacate EQ forever so I can play in peace with my friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dare to dream,<br>
