I used the information here as my primary guide.  I've gotten all rods so far except Lower Guk; this one I am waiting on a kind high level person to assist me a bit.  Anyway, I just wanted to share my experience and particuarly note that there were no sharks or sailors in Erud's Crossing (zone was completely empty of people too).<br>
<br>
Oasis - piece of cake if you can get wolf form from a druid.  Ask nicely and be willing to donate. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Unrest - Easy also, just run along the right side wall.  You might need enduring breath if you aren't comfortable with the location underwater.  I &quot;almost&quot; ran out of breath.<br>
<br>
Dagnor's Cauldron - This one was a bit scary.  I used levitate to find the general location and viewed underwater for a while.  I couldn't see the rod from the top.  I finally (with SoW for faster swimming) just dove for it and managed to find it against the wall.  Didn't have much trouble with lack of breath and was invisible; had no problem with aqua goblins as none were near.<br>
<br>
Qeynos - this one was very easy.  I went in from the north wall entrance and used my map from eqatlas.com to get to the shark pit.  No aggro problems of any sort for me (Erudite Agnostic).<br>
<br>
Highpass - this one is simple also.  I just invis'd myself to avoid orcs and gnolls and jumped in the water to get the wand.<br>
<br>
Lake Rathe - This one was easy, but the leg-work was in finding a druid willing to assist me.  You NEED enduring breath for this one and wolf-form is very preferable.  I had fish scales and 10pp (yes i'm poor) ready and was able to get a druid to assist me.<br>
<br>
Everfrost - You will need enduring breath for this one also.  I tried to go without and when my breath was at half, I turned around.  Once I was in the tunnel, I saw a Lich and his pet (both very red to me).  However, I just waited and they moved down the tunnel, finally going the opposite direction of the house holding the wand.  I was very nervous about the 3 green skeles <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I didn't have invis to undead.  I buffed up with damage shield, major shielding, and cold resist buff.  Once at full health and mana, I stood as far from the house as I could and used Lightning bolt on the skeleton I could see through the door.  He didn't move, however another popped on me from somewhere (not sure where).  I proceeded to bolt the skele in the house to death and then rooted the other one that was on me.  I then killed the rooted skele.  With one left in the house, I ran in and got the wand.  I rooted the other skeleton and used my remaning mana to gate out.<br>
<br>
Neriak - I simply used invis after I had explored the zones with a newbie dark elf.  Luckily, my invis didn't drop as I was moving to get the rod.  I then just gated out from the bank opposite the Priest of Discord.<br>
<br>
Erud's Crossing - I saved this for next to last as I was very nervous about the sharks.  I got all preped and read the guides and everything.  Well, I showed up and didn't see any sharks or zombie sailors.  Someone else I talked to hadn't seen any sharks either.  So I just swam down and got the rod.  Not sure if the zone has been changed or what, but this was one of the easiest to get.<br>
<br>
Lower Guk - Tried to find assistance last night.  I will try again tonight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I just wanted to share the adventures of a young wizard seeking his Staff of Wheel.  With a little help from others, this quest is very doable at 24.  Levitate is extremely helpful with certain rods (Dagnor's, Erud's Crossing).  I was invisible for basically every rod attempt, just as habit and a safety precaution.<br>

Major advice.  Do not take a friend along.<br>
<br>
I took a friend along thinking I'd need help with the 3 skele's.  Before I knew it, he was dead and soon found out that Lich killed him.  What the heck is this Lich guy doing down there anyway.<br>
<br>
Anyways I got the rod and killed the 3 skele's by myself and proceeded to drag the corpse back to the entrance.  Guess what, ran into Lich Pet, got blinded, dotted, nuked, and killed.<br>
<br>
It would be best for any other Wizards in the future to go down there alone.  Those skele's will drop well enough for someone level 24 or up.<br>
<br>
Get that rod and GATE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulordbug.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordBug</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/2/01 2:34:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: re:</span><hr size=1> &quot;What the heck is this Lich guy doing down there anyway.&quot;<br>

That's where he roams....  You have to be very careful getting this rod.  Might want to ask a tracker to check for him before you attempt this one. <p><BR><BR>

This quest is easy at level 22 i didnt even kill the skellies in the house.  I had a sow on so i ran in grabbed the rod and ran out and gated before they could get to me.  sure i took a few hits in the house, but big woop if you have a damage sheild and sow.<br>
<br>
Oh and the one in lower Guk it was a pain but doable, it can be confusing to find if you've never been there.  A nice paly (tons of clerics and paladins can be found here at peek times) invised undead me and showed me were it was.  once there i swam to the top of the water on far side of room, normaly you wont get agroed if you bob farthest side of room.  just make sure you dont swim up tell your at the back wall.  then turn around, be carefull the hand see's invis undead, and i have had the hand agro me when i was standing below the water on the ground level.  I think it was closer to the ledge then normal.  <br>
<br>
Ok the peice of the staff is on the ground near the feet of the other spawn in the room, an undead knight thing.  swim forward grab the rod and prepare to die, try and get as far down in the water before you die.  Now if you were smart and bound yourself at the zone point of L-guk you wont have a long walk ahead of you.  At peek times you can usualy find a nice paly or cleric sitting by the zone point meding or resting from fighting that can cast invis to undead on you.  then go back to spot same as before and select your corpse by looking up in the water and drag it to you.  also be warned there is a wandering undead froggy on the bottom floor wait tell he leaves the area of the hall while you do this.  he takes a minute or 2 to sikle through his wandering rought.  after looting corpse gate, you'll be at zone intrance and have the rod.<br>
<br>
Ok i must admit i died 6 times doing this and im sure the people in the zone where getting anoyed at my pattitions for invis undead, That and many were telling me i shouldnt be there at least tell i told the zone what i was doing then they all shut up.  now that i know how to do this i think i can pull it off if i had to do it again with one death, and with invis undead potions i wouldnt be petitioning for invis undead.  Of course you can always get a friend to help you and cast invis undead on you.<br>
<br>
Have fun =) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=artillis>Artillis</A> at: 6/5/01 1:34:16 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uezno.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ezno</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/posticons/eyes.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/5/01 4:39:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=279.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Staff of Wheel Quest Adventure and Observations</span><hr size=1> <br>
One thing should be added on the quest information page that I found rather annoying.   The Lake Rathe rod says to go to the &quot;first island&quot;.  This is the first island from the Rathe Mountains zone entrance, not the South Karana zone entrance.    I figured that out simply because it wasn't called Aviak Island (like we always called it back in the day) but thought the directions to it could be a little more clear since most wizards will probably be coming in from SK and &quot;first island&quot; is a bit misleading there. <p> <br>
