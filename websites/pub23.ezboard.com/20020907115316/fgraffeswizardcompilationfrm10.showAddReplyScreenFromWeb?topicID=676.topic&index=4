<br>
You realize the 1000 pt nuke you just outlined is bigger than our biggest lure? In fact your entire line of stone spells demonstrates (imo) a huge overestimation of lures.<br>
<br>
at 44 we can lure for 360ish<br>
at 51 our lure is in the 640 range<br>
by 60 it's 825<br>
<br>
If you wanted 'stone' to fall in line (~70% of wizard nuke) you would have to cut all of your numbers flat in half.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, maybe you are already factoring that in thru armor class... but the numbers you put up, if you actually got those numbers they'd be stomping our toes clean off =)<br>
<br>
As an aside, your stone series would amount to &gt;&gt; lure in pvp, particularly against casters since you'd have a good chance to land a full hit (1hb) and, by the mechanics of it, probably no 60% nerf. From what I've heard, mage versus wiz pvp is one of the few encounters in the game that approaches balance. This would **** it up right squarely =)<br>
<br>
And as Grim said, you already get pets. The only reason we get lures is because we have no pets. I really appreciate your respectful attitude, and I hate to dissagree with ya, but I don't think mages should be any more damaging than they already are. Look, there's already hideous class competition in the damage department. Mages are one of the FEW classes that can potentially get away from that, because you have a monopoly on a utility function (summoning). If verant would make more summoned items that were worth a darn, then mages would fall into favor without stepping on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anybody's</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> toes. Mages are the only class I can think of with that type of potential; every other class shares key functions with somebody else, and can't be tweaked without multiple levels of balance issues.<br>
<br>
What I would love -so- much more is if verant fixed pets and made more useful mage-summoned items available. Regarding pets, fixing the pathing would be nice, but even a quick hack to make the indiff to all would help a ton, right? It could be implimented as an alt skill or an enchanter buff if Verant wants to be particularly mean about it =/<br>
<br>
Regarding summoned items: You know what I want to see? Bet you can guess =)  --Summoned items with hideous big +mana!<br>
Maybe a summoned halo with like 400 +mana; rings, earrings, etc...<br>
Speaking of which, I'm still waiting for them to design a Tinkered: mana capacitor (back slot, backpack graphic) with like 500 mana, 15 weight and no other stats.<br>
<br>
And there is supposedly a &quot;summon peridots&quot; spell in the spdat now. If it isn't a mage spell, it damn well should be! Sure, it would require a few lines of hard-code, to make the summoned pdots no-rent (unsellable) but still work as reagents... but it would be so awesome! I suspect this spell would put the epic pet to shame, in terms of influencing group/raid desirability. And again, without stepping on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anybody's</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> toes. Indeed without really changing the balance of the game at all!<br>
<br>
How about a mage-summoned sword that procs a HUGE debuff to charisma? ie, the ultimate taunt sword?<br>
<br>
Now it's time for me to completely depart from the realm of the reasonable and dream a bit =)  no need for flames from anyone; I realize the following examples are probably bad ideas, but the mechanics of them might be used for something cool.<br>
...<br>
How about this for a mana-booster item/spell:<br>
mage spell (1.5k mana) summons a no rent item.<br>
<br>
the item is given to others on his raid; it has one charge with a 2 minute cast time to summon a second item, which is the actual mana booster. The mana booster is no drop, and has an instant 1k mana charge on it.<br>
<br>
The point of going thru 2 steps, is that it gives you a huge mana boost item which is tradeable but cannot be stockpiled. (the person recieving the item is forced to stop and cast for 2 minutes before the effect becomes available; after which the effect is instantly available at any time, but no longer tradeable) It would essentially allow the mage to give each person in his group/raid a 1k mana emergency pack.<br>
<br>
You could also design a similar non-stockpilable summons spell to summon a strong arrow (max arrow damage stat x1.5 or something). It would essentially allow a mage to give a single powerful nuke to each of his archers on a raid.<br>
<br>
It would be an awesome item to have, but it would probably unbalance high level encounters, and be no fun for the mage anyway... Summoning a bunch of mana expensive items at the beginning of a raid... yay. bet you gotta hate that... but... You are a summoning class. I have a gut feeling that the majority of your work will always need to come be before the fight starts. There may simply be no way around it.<br>
<br>
Sorry, I know that was a bunch of rambling on my part...<br>
But in short, please don't compete for damage. You're already pretty good at it; the best in some situations; and seeing as damage is a widely-competed racket, you are bound to get people riled up if you push for more. Mages have the potential to be a utility class which is valuable in its own right, without competing with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> anybody</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. That is a rare option, and I wish for your sake and for mine that verant lets you expand in that direction rather than choking the damage field any further. With the utility potential mages have, imo it would be a crying shame and a horrible waste if you were balanced by DD capacity instead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>(Title left blank)</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/10/02 6:50:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=676.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> still no lures</span><hr size=1> The answer is to make your pets more useful in areas where people don't want them now, NOT to give you Lures.

<br>
As for mana, well we currently DO have a mana boost item..mod rod Mk2. I always hand one out to everyone BEFORE a big fight takes place. Epic wizzies love 'em hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Even on no-epic wizzies, if they watch agro carefully, clicking a rod -300hp +220 mana can be a very useful trade. And in XP groups I've churned 'em out for wizards as well (use boots for nukes).<br>
<br>
Well unless pet aggro/pathing/ability to give NO ATTACK command are seriously addressed mages are really SHAFTED, and I'm sick to death of it. Sheesh, I LIKE playing my mage, but with this garbage about pets taking xp, and when you're lower level on raids doing diddly damage on mobs (even when higher when you can't use pet and on certain mobs) it gets really frustrating :/<br>
<br>
To give an example, Veeshan's Peak, no way in HELL would I dare use a pet in there *shudders at the thought*.<br>
Or when I was lower level in Hate, nukes would generally do about 200 hp thanks to resists, and I COULDN'T land a damn thing on clerics of Innoruuk for a long time.<br>
<br>
Casters have poor attack skills hence I thought that would be a good and sensible limit on the proposed *projectile* spells, I dont mind if damage is lowered, but we sure as heck NEED them. At the same time wizards need more banes/better lures.<br>
To point something out: wizards = masters of DD, right? So they would have developed far more nukes to deal with *specific* targets, wouldn't they? And from this...why dont' wizards get crit nuke skills from <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> low level?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It's NUTS wizards have to pay xp to buy what should be an ability you earn. Mages/necros should earn it later on with AA because we are not masters of nukes.<br>
<br>
As an aside, I debuff on some raids, was kind of nice when my wiz pal who was about lvl 51-52, said he loved having me around cause his resist rate was drastically reduced, so he could light up, hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Frankly I have little hope of VI fixing our pets, the latest *face screws up like Kermit* stuff from Absor has made things worse *sigh*<br>

I would much rather pets got fixed somehow, so that we can use them on ANY raid, but VI's atttitude lately...*grimaces*<br>
We've already pointed out making pets neutral would mean no AFk XPing is possible which should please VI, as well as help us.<br>
<br>
Don't know if you've been to TOV or upper islands of Sky, but they are prime examples of where pets are totally FUBARed. isle 7 has pathing that's just totally &amp;$^$£%!<br>
<br>
Want mana galore? get a 56+ mage, slap a hit point buff (aegolism etc) and regen on him, assign a healer to look after  said mage, he casts Rod of Mystic Transvergance, uses 1 charge, drop rod now with 2 charges..he gets healed as needed. This system=mana GALORE <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Wizzie with epic hsould have rod hot keyed, runs low..click, loses no hit points thanks to epic rune (wonder if Spell shield works in conjunction with this, hm??), and gains 220 mana per click.<br>
<br>
you are correct, mages shouldn't get much increase in our DDs damage, unless ALL casters got an across the board % increase, not really sure thats needed though, more FT items from non-uber mobs seems better in regards to all Int caster balance problems? Would like to point out that our nukes and pets dont' scale after 50, which is one of the big bones of contention. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>
lvl 44nuke = 600 hp, lvl 44 pets hits for 48.<br>
Lvl 57 nuke hits for 825 hp, lvl 57 earth pet hits for 60<br>
</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
That doesn't scale well does it? I dont know if wizards have a similar problem in regards of scaling up 40 to post 50.<br>
And I know some wizzies will point out lvl 34 nukes here, ahem ours is a bolt and I personally have no objection to wizzies getting upgrades, I'm all for it! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
On a point I made: Do you think wizards should get more lures/banes at various levels? To me it would seem an excellent way to address some wiz problems, and make the game more fun (rather than camp the FBSS for a melee, camp the archmage for a Froglock Bane, hehe)<br>
<br>
Your idea of summoned arows is good, would like to see that myself, say it procs a lvl 8 nuke or some such, hehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't see wizards as rivals per se, but as colleagues: you do it one way, we do it another, hence I was asking your opinion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have a gut feeling that increasing your nuking power is never going to properly compensate for broken pets and a spotty summons list.

On Raids If I could find a mage that would cast their Malo line of spells I would have a new best friend.  Problem is all the mages/necros/shaman that I have been raiding with have all forgotten about their debuffs.  Therefore reducing my damage ablility as well.  From what I have noticed while fighting without debuffs I average about 60-75% of my max fighting power.  With debuffs I am alot closer to 90%.<br>
<br>
You know as well as I do what VI will say.  &quot;Since Mages can't use their pets on raids, they still have debuffs, DSs and nukes.  Therefore they are still balanced.  We like the idea that mages have to change their style of play during raids.&quot;  Now if in game the balance is true does not seem to matter to them.  I think they only look at such things on paper.  Oh how I hope caster balance brings some changes, big changes.  I really hope Mages and Wizards benifit from these changes not just the triad.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urombusmindspire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Moderator</font></td></tr></table><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Verant's #1 Fanboy</font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/11/02 5:37:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=676.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/sidepic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mage Lures</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The problem is we OFTEN CANNOT USE PETS!!<br>
<br>
Where can mages generally NOT use pets? RAIDS. Please do not tell me we can, because generally we CAN'T (I have used pets everywhere bar TOV and ST, I know what I'm doing and I STILL can't or won't use pets in many raids).<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
There's almost no situation where you can't use a pet, if you know how to control it.  Brodie, Fuedar, and Maltily (Mages in my guild obviously!) always have a pet up on every raid with the exception of Ssra when we're moving.  When we get to the boss we're there for they get them up.  We have never had a pet train us anywhere.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Where do we meet high resist mobs usually? On Raids, yes?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Nope, not anymore.  At least on a majority of the mobs.  Obviously before the resist change patch went in there were problems, but since then it's virtually non-exhistant.  I know because I always try my trusty rend robe (mr based nuke) on every mob we fight.  Rend lands almost every single time.  Besides boss mobs fire and magic nukes will land on almost every standard mob found in dungeons.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> How would YOU like it, as a wizard, if on a raid you are told &quot;Oh no nukes, O'Kiels the tanks, TL and port folk in and out.&quot; Would YOU be happy? That's the situation mages face, and I for one am rather *** about it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well, our job is nuking and dealing fast efficient damage.  Your job as a Mage is to provide damage and raid utility.  You can't have the best of both worlds.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> mages, wizards and necros are the damage dealing Int casters, we've been screwed over for ages, I am merely proposing one way to help my class that's within reason. I don't mind the idea of mobs with high resists, I do object when we aren't given the means to affect them by using a different set of tools.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Check out the &quot;damage&quot; a Necromancer deals on raids, then come back here and see if that statement holds true.  Necros can only do extreme damage to mobs on long, drawn out fights... and at that they can only do it if there are 1-2 at the most there since their dots don't stack.<br>
<br>
Mages combat high resists with their pets which will hit anything.  See your pet as a lure-based DoT. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In any case one of the class defining skills of a Wizard next to quick hard damage was reliable damage (lures).  Personally I don't think anyone should have lures except Wizards and Abashi said awhile back that no one else would get lures but Wizards.  I wouldn't be totally against a level 60 Mage spell that did say.. 500 lure dmg for 350 mana or something.  <br>
<br>
Lastly you came here asking our opinion on what we thought about Mages getting lures and you got it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Don't get so upset when we say we don't like the idea.  I feel for you guys and I know you're not perfect but there are many other solutions than just giving Mages lure-based spells. <p><br>
