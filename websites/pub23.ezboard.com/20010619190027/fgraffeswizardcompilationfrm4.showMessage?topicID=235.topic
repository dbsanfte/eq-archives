<br>
I was sitting in Dreadlands the other day spamming the zone that i was looking for a group.  3 of my guild members who are not to much higher then me in level were near by in a group also.  I had even asked them to let me know when there was an opening.  well a few minutes passed and i was getting sick of waiting so i went and worked on my tailring skill and came back and gave a couple of the guild members in that group some tailor made quivers because i knew they wanted some.  I was low on mana so i sat there to med a little.  In there little group they had 3 warriors (2 of them guild members at level 45) 2 shamens (1 a 39th level guild member) and a 44 level wizard in their group.  <br>
<br>
one of my fellow guild members then asks me if im busy and i tell them no that im not.  then they ask if i can get a friend of theirs from commons and bring them there cuz he didnt know were that place was.  A red flag went up here.  But not wanting to cause any strife with my hesitation i said sure.  Heck i even like porting people at least then im feeling usefull.<br>
<br>
well i get this person and port them back to the dreadlands and take them all the way back to were my guild mates were  and they thanked me graciously.  soon i saw the other warrior in there group say good buy thanks for the group, and all that, and then left.  The open spot in the group was then filled with the warrior I had gone and gotten from commons.  <br>
<br>
So here i am in DL looking for a group then asked by some guild mates to go and TAXI anouther tank clear from commons to replace their warrior that was leaving.  they then had 3 warriors 2 shamens and a wizard again.<br>
<br>
I can understand there desire to want a BETTER group for getting exp.  But this was a low blow, I had to log after this happened i was so frustrated.<br>
<br>
Now someon tell me wizards are fairly balanced for groups and i'll show you one pissed off wizard.  Heck we're not THAT freindly of a group class, not even my own guild wanted me.  I see my self as a decent wizard i dont complain and i can hold my own with learning to balance mana usage with everyone else so im not holding people back.  But even still i have seen a group i was in do better without me then with me cuz they were able to pull faster, cuz they had a more reliable always there sorse of damage.  were as i am a sorce of damage that is only as good as my mana regen in comparison to how quickly they pull mobs.  when a group likes to pull 3-4 mobs at a time for fast leveing and the tanks are fully decked out to handle the hits with a heal now and then.  We wizards are quickly out classed cuz we cant afford to nuke even once on each mob to HELP or we run out of mana even with clerity.  At least this is what ive seen.  so groups would rather have anouther ALWAYS there sourse of damage like a rouge.<br>
<br>
Ok im done ranting, but man im upset.<br>

I guess i posted this mostly to RANT.  I had been looking for a group there was a slot opening in there group and they had me go fetch a tank for them from west commons to fill the gap.  I personaly think i could have filled it.  maybee not as well as a tank, but then thats why so many of us rant about our class being unfairly balanced isn't it, we tend to get picked last in many situations cuz other classes just do better as a whole in a group.  not all classes necesarly, but most.  <br>
<br>
I guess one of the main things I was trying to bring out in my frustration is the fact that it can be a pain for us wizards to find groups as many of you already know.  And the last thing i want people to think is I can't play my wizard effectively, far from it.  I gain exp quiet well and solo well and even group well many people have told me this.  But that still dosent change the fact that it's a pain to find groups.  Please don't view me as some player who can't play their class and is complaining about something that is their own fault.  Once again i state that i was merely using the situation to emphasise a point on class balance.  please foucus on whole thread not just the story.<br>

I think the first few answers to your post are so ironic.  You post a common themed story to a rant board to indicate why wizards aren't &quot;balanced&quot; and to share your (warranted) personal frustration.  You are dissed out of a group with your own guild because two wizards are &quot;too much,&quot; yet two shaman and three melee are fine.  Gee, I hear the dull thud of a point landing.  <br>
<br>
The point is simple, if balance wasn't at issue two wizards or two anything wouldn't be a problem, it would just be a different style of play.  Personally, with all the stuns and roots an extra wizard gives I'd say it's a push.  In fact what the melee probably didn't want is ping pong, where the wizzies could drop stuff while the melee cut at the MOB's backs.  In fact given the probablility of adds, including spiders, I'd have taken a second wiz in a second.  Dreadland MOBs hit very hard, and even three melee are gonna get walloped.  My guess is the shaman were pushed anyway with healing.<br>
<br>
Another melee was not necessary at that point, merely a manifestation of the melee-centric bullshit our two senior wizards have clearly bought into. /sigh<br>
<br>
So the follow up in the post is two senior wizards suggesting it's either a personal bias or &quot;wouldn't you want one more melee?&quot;  /boggle<br>
<br>
You TOTALLY missed the guys point and then ratified it.  No wonder we're so dysfunctional as a class.    <br>

<br>
I wasn't trying to diss him or whatever you thought, I was trying to comfort him and give him and answer as to why this occured. <br>
<br>
What are we dependant on?  Mana.<br>
What are Warriors dependant on?  HP and their weapons.<br>
<br>
Would you rather sit there, in a group, with no Enchanter or Bard, waiting for 2 Wizards to get their mana back?  Or would you rather have 3 Warriors hacking away at a target distributing the damage taken between the three of them?  Again, when I fought in DL with my Cleric and had a heavy melee group I almost NEVER had to heal because the mobs fell so fast and they distributed the agro between all them.<br>
<br>
The fact is, we're good in groups that can't provide mana regen to us.. but we can't perform to the best of our abilities where as a Melee can.  Verant has to do something to make us more desirable in groups w/o mana regen suppliers.. Harvest helps, just not enough.<br>
<br>
Sorry if you took offense to my post, it wasn't meant to be that way.  I shall retract it just for you, Covenant U. <p><BR>

So Grim, no need to get your knickers in a twist <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Read above, and you and Rombus will see the only time I used the phrase &quot;diss&quot; was to describe what Artillus' guild did to him.<br>
<br>
Samadhi observed that the first wizard didn't seem to have trouble getting into a group.  Sorry, that just seems to have missed the poster's point and is inadequate to explain his guild's behavior.  They had 3 wars 2 shammies and one wiz.  A war leaves and a spot opens.  They not only chose a war but made their guildie a bitch to go and get him.  So I guess Samadhi's point was that we can get into groups easy, but we just can't be in groups with our own.  But the more shammies and wars the merrier.  Silly me, here I thought we had trouble grouping.   Thanks for clearing that up.  In fact, Samadhi's point was less about explaining why they rejected Artillus than it was meant to be inflammatory, but hey, I've read alot of your posts, Samadhi, the self appointed &quot;anti-ranter.&quot;  Typical fare. <br>
<br>
As for Rombus (whose posts I often agree with and nearly always enjoy) I disagreed with your point, but hey it's just your opinion.  And mine is mine.  You suggested, Rom,  (before you needlessly edited your own post) that anyone in that same group would have naturally preferred a melee.  Even Artillus.  That's just plain wrong and I found it objectionable coming from a level 60.  Hey you MUST be good or you bought your wiz on E-bay <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Seems like a few others agreed with me on this.  Your post assumed that by taking in another wiz the group was doomed to sit around waiting on two wizards to regain mana.   Now in all honesty, I expect that thinking from person who only plays a melee, but hell YOU should know better.  There is absolutely NO reason that group would be unable to do almost continuous pulls with two wizards, if they are good and judicious with mana.  Sure if a Ravishing wanders by they are gonna mana dump, but I argue the group lives without a zone.  With 3 warriors somebody's gonna start making use of the shammies' sow, or take a dirt nap.  And if you don't think those shamen are gonna have to take a med break every so often you're kidding yourself.  <br>
<br>
MY point, not having missed anyone else's in the slightest, is that Rom so quickly drew the EXACT conclusion that keeps us from getting into groups.  <br>
<br>
I still find that disturbing.  And I stand by the posters's point becuase it's been my similar experience and it's just wrong.  I agree to some extent with the &quot;I suck&quot; syndrome, it's a vicious cycle.  You say it, you believe it, you won't group, your skills atrophy.<br>
<br>
So yeah I agree that guild has to go pound sand, but brother wizards let's get it together.  Making excuses for, or adopting, lazy melee thinking is weak and cancerous.  <br>

Sorry, that just seems to have missed the poster's point and is inadequate to explain his guild's behavior. They had 3 wars 2 shammies and one wiz. A war leaves and a spot opens. They not only chose a war but made their guildie a bitch to go and get him. So I guess Samadhi's point was that we can get into groups easy, but we just can't be in groups with our own. But the more shammies and wars the merrier. Silly me, here I thought we had trouble grouping. Thanks for clearing that up. In fact, Samadhi's point was less about explaining why they rejected Artillus than it was meant to be inflammatory, but hey, I've read alot of your posts, Samadhi, the self appointed &quot;anti-ranter.&quot; Typical fare. ))<br>
<br>
My point was that the other Wizard had no trouble in the group, and that they probably did not invite him based on personal reasons and not class reasons. <br>
<br>
Also when a group loses a member they tend to replace that memeber with someone of the same class (like Rombus said), they don't just go around and invite random people. If you lose a tank, you get a tank. If you lose a chanter, you get a chanter. I don't see many groups replacing a enchanter with say an SK, because they work with a set group layout and then want to continue working with that group layout. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the attempted personal attack by the way =) Very amusing.<br>

<br>
Not that they invited someone into there group other than you as a replacement...<br>
<br>
Rather, that they had you port them in, and then ESCORT them to the camp.  That is very poor behavior, and a bad way to treat someone who is supposed to be your ally, or even friend.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll grant them *some* slack, in that the guildies may not have had final word in group membership.  It is still inexcusable that they would have you port out, pick someone up, and then bring them right to their feet.<br>
<br>
I trust they didn't compensate you for your time.  It sounds like it was simply an expectation that, you are a guild wizard, and there for your duty to play taxi.  The druids are all too busy getting groups, or raking in the exp soloing.<br>

If I were you, I'd probably find a new guild.  Any true friends you have in the guild will understand, and not hold your move against you.<br>

Well Samadhi on my server groups are a bit more fluid than &quot;We lost a warrior lets get another,&quot; and when a party member quits it's more of a &quot;What new class would maintain a viable group.&quot;  As you point out, that rule probably doesn't apply to clerics and chanters.  A warrior for warrior replacement (out of three melee) in Dreadlands?  Nah, not crucial.  And grabbing one from the old world is a bit much, especially considering where the wizzie port in Dreads is relative to Karnor's. <br>
<br>
So I think you are really reaching here in your &quot;explanation&quot; of what might have happened.  But usually the obvious answer is the right one.  People assume a wizard can't keep up.  One wizzie?  Sure.  Two?  Now we're gonna slow down, no way!  That was the poster's point, plain and simple.<br>
<br>
So it was my opinion that you were being snide in the face of the poster's frustration and covered it up later in the thread by expanding on your so-called point.  It bugged me because I didn't believe you were trying to make a point, I felt you were being belittling.  It offended me.  I also find it curious that a guy who evinces such a profound distaste for &quot;whiners&quot; - you spend an inordinate amount of time trolling the Rant boards.  <br>
<br>
There is a lot of pity partying and gratuitous whining out there, and de-bunking it is fine, but I thought it inappropriate here.  An admittedly personal response on my part to a perceived personal attack on your part.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Maybe the warrior was a personal friend of the one of the group members, if not all of them? Maybe he had asked to join the group when they had an opening before the original poster? You don't know these things, neither do I. You cannot get the entire story based on his information, so it is ignorant to assume that it was based on class reasons, as 1 wizard was already in the group, which was my point if you bothered to comprehend what you read.<br>
<br>

If I wanted to be snide I wouldn't try to hide it, thanks for the concern though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Most of my posts on this board (all 20 of them or so) are because the thread was on another forum and moved here, or the post was interesting to me. You can call that trolling if you want, in which case there are quite a few trolls on this board. And yes, I do dislike whiners. There is a great difference between whiners (see hadalgo on General) and people who actually offer some ideas and discuss the class with some semblence of intelligence (Grimstaff and others).<br>
<br>
((There is a lot of pity partying and gratuitous whining out there, and de-bunking it is fine, but I thought it inappropriate here. An admittedly personal response on my part to a perceived personal attack on your part.))<br>
<br>
The difference was my first post was not intended to be a personal attack, I'm sorry you saw it that way. If I want my opinion of a person to be known I generally will state it right out. Enchanters are more the masters of subtlety, us Wizards go out and make things known =)<br>

I've posted the idea before, 1 tank plus 1 tank=2 tanks.  One wizard solo is around 9 tenths of a tank at many levels because of the downtime, but two wizards together are more powerful combined than the two tanks together.<br>
<br>
Generally, the moment you get turned into a taxi by your guild, it's time to leave and find a new guild.  The moment a magician gets turned into a CoH bitch, it's time for that magician to move on.  Every person should be treated with respect in a guild, with no specific class being more important than the others.  This is why casters hop from guild to guild more often than melees.<br>
