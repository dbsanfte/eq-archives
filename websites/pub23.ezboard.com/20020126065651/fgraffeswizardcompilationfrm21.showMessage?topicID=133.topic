I'm amazed at how few people seem to be interested in this as this is one of the most fun, most lucrative things I've ever done in EQ.<br>
<br>
We've only done this in Iceclad so far with Dire wolves.  We've put together PBAOE groups about 5 or 6 times now.  We have a stock of about 10 or 12 people, most that are &quot;veterans&quot; now and a few that are still green, but are wanting to try.  I think most people can't grasp what I'm telling them when I invite them to join us.  I think they immediately either discount what I'm saying as false or else what I'm saying doesn't register properly.  <br>
<br>
I say &quot;Interested in joining a PBAOE group?&quot; <br>
and they see &quot;join group?&quot; and they say &quot;nah, not right now.&quot;<br>
<br>
Some people get a more detailed description, depending on how many tells I have going and how busy I am.  I often send something like &quot;Interested in joining a PBAOE group?  It involves taking down 15 to 20 mobs at once.  It's great XP and lots of fun.&quot;<br>
and most people still see something like &quot;want join group?  Uber!&quot; and so they respond with that same &quot;nah, not right now.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'd hoped posting here would speed up recruitment.  But, regardless, we're doing just fine without.  We recruite slowly but steadily.  Most people have no concept of what we're going to do even though I explain it in more painful detail than this post once they join the group.  I'll type out a full page in groupsay and get a response like &quot;k&quot; or &quot;IC&quot;.  Then when I pull 7 or 8 mobs for a test run, the new guy flips out and starts running around in circles screaming &quot;on me! one on me!  Get it off!  Zone!  Zone!&quot;  Then after a couple of fights they give us a &quot;This is crazy!  Now I know what you meant by taking down 20 at a time.  Like, what else COULD I have meant?  Is there some dual meaning in &quot;we're going to take down 20 mobs at once&quot; that I don't see?<br>
<br>
I think we're comfortable with Iceclad now and we're going to move on to an area that's a little more dungeon-esque before we finally move into an actual dungeon.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Uuvin of Povar for helping me with this.  Uuvin is a level 60 druid who is, as far as I can see, one of THE FOREMOST authorities on PBAOE grouping and kiting.  I watched him solo about 20 to 25 coldain mobs outside of Thurgadin several times.<br>

Uuvin uses a mass snaring spell that druids apparently don't get until level 50 something (52 or 54?).  I had to interpolate and adapt the method slightly to suite lower levels obviously for my own use.<br>
<br>
With a druid partner, she and I were able to do about 20 to 25 dire wolves in one kite yesterday. Most of you will likely not believe this. It is a little time consuming. It took as long as about 2 or 3 quad kites WITHOUT using snare would normally take. The process is tedious to explain properly. Email me if you want a detailed explanation in the meantime. If I get a few emails, I'll probably just post an explanation. I'm also happy to give a demonstration to any disbelievers.<br>

I'm going to try and explain this briefly, but it's complicated.  I'll try and explain the reasons that this works and the reasons that you do the things you do using this method.  I should really post some diagrams with it, but I'm not going to take the time.  I'm going to use an example to explain it also.<br>
<br>
If you're afraid of dieing or if the chance of death turns you off to learning a new method, don't bother reading this.  If this applies to you, send me an email if you want to know my thoughts on &quot;people like you&quot;.  You also need to be familiar with quad kiting to do this.  Quad kiting teaches you to keep your mobs grouped tightly so that your damage spell hits them all.  You need to understand how to keep mobs grouped to do this.  Quad kiting also teaches you other important things that I don't want to go into detail on, like if you run too far away from your mobs, you'll lose them and they'll magically port back to random locations and regenerate at an outrageous rate.<br>
<br>
Note that you probably should not attempt this unless you are at least close to level 40.  I believe it would work at lower levels, but there is a higher chance of death.  You MUST take a hit each time you cast thunderclap using this method.  At level 42, I was usually between 60 and 90 percent HP after casting thunderclap and taking my hits.  At lower levels, you will have less HP and lower AC and defense, so you'll get hit more often and for higher damage.  That's what would make this more dangerous for you.<br>
<br>
I'm going to use IceClad for the example.  It's the easiest place for this as far as I've seen.  I've done this dozens and dozens of times successfuly in IceClad with just a shaman or druid partner each time.  If you want to do this at another area, you'll have to interpolate the method to suite your own needs.<br>
<br>
Start off by making sure you have your thunderclap spell.  It's a level 34 PBAOE damage spell.  If you don't know what PBAOE is or if you don't know how thunderclap works, you need to figure it out before attempting this.  Thunderclap is your most important spell for this.  It's really the only spell you need memorized to do this technically.  Now find a shaman or druid that's around level 35 to 45.  He needs to have Greater Healing, that's his most important spell.<br>
<br>
To start, you'll want to agree on a &quot;spot&quot; with your shaman/druid partner.  You both have to understand that that spot is where all the action takes place.  The spot I'm using in this example is on the South coast of the main island in IceClad.  If you start from the EW bridge, you face the bridge and turn left.  You're now facing the South coast.  Follow that coast until you come to a chain of islands that follow the coast.  It's not too far from the bridge and there's not a tree anywhere near these islands.  The approximate loc of these islands is around neg6000, pos6000 give or take a couple of hundred units.  If you follow the coast east until that chain of islands ends, you'll see that the last of the islands is much smaller than the others.  About 20 or 30 yards off the coast next to that little island is the spot.  Once you agree on the spot, you're almost ready to pull some wolves.  First though, you want to buff yourself up as much as possible and have the shaman buff you with shifting shield and agility if he has them.  Also be SURE to get a fresh SOW before you go to pull (that's right, you're the puller!)<br>
<br>
Now you're ready to pull.  You can start with 10 or 12 wolves if you're more comfortable with that, but theoretically, this method works just as well with 10 or 12 as it does with 50 or 1000 wolves.  The only thing that causes theory to break down into reality is lag.  With 1000 wolves, you would lag so badly that I believe it would be impossible to do this.  I'm on a 384 SDSL line, with a GeForce2 GTS and a 1.2 GHZ TBird, and I notice a bit of lag with 30 wolves, but it's not enough lag to cause any real problems.  So, start with how ever many wolves you're comfortable with.  I use a staff of temperate flux to pull.  I used to use the level 1 damage spell- I believe it's shock of frost.  If you're using the level 1 damage spell, you need to stop and cast on each wolf to pull it.  It's much slower than the staff of temperate flux.  The staff has a debuff spell effect when you right click on it.  The casting time is ZERO, so you can cast it while you're running.  This speeds up pulling in this method by at least double and pulling is a big time eater.  Note that you should NOT use proximity pulling in this method (ie pulling mobs just by getting close enough to them to aggro them).  I have tried proximity pulling and once you have 12 or 15 mobs, some will just start walking away as if they've forgotten about you.  It's very strange.  As long as you actually damage them or debuff them, this won't happen.<br>
<br>
So pull your dire wolves (we're using dire wolves for this example) and run them to the coast EAST of &quot;the spot&quot;.  Now follow the coast WEST toward your partner who is waiting at &quot;the spot&quot;.  When your partner comes into visual range, you'll want to do a circle around the wolves to round them up into a close group.  Stay WELL AWAY from your partner while you do this.  Once you have the wolves rounded up nicely, run along the coast toward your partner and &quot;the spot&quot;.  as soon as you're in casting range, your partner needs to reSOW you (he should reSOW himself when you say INC).  ReSOWing you will do 2 things that are VERY important.  First, it will obviously ensure that your SOW doesn't run out since you've been probably pulling for 10 to 15 minutes (pulling 20 and 30 dire wolves takes that long).  The other important thing it will do is it will cause the wolves to get mad at your partner since he is helping you and they're aggroed on you (mad at you).  You will stop just a little ways inside casting range of your partner (20 to 30 yards is a good distance, but it's hard to judge what a yard is in EQ).  When you stop, your partner is at the spot, you are 20 to 30 yards east of the spot, and the wolves are further east of the spot.  You, your partner, and the wolves form a perfectly straight line along the coast.  You turn around and face the wolves and your partner is now 20 to 30 yards behind you in line with the wolves.  So your partner reSOWs you the first round and he HEALS you every round after that if you need it.<br>
<br>
Here I will explain one of the fundamental reasons that this works.  Let me first say that you CANNOT do this without a partner even if you were to never get hit.  The reason is this:  Only 4 mobs will come into your melee range and attack you.  If 20 wolves are chasing you, once 4 have entered your melee range, the other 16 (20 - 4 = 16) will simply walk away and will not resume chasing you again until there are fewer than 4 mobs in your melee range.  This is an interesting part of the AI.  Your thunderclap spell will only hit mobs that are in your melee range (to the best of my knowledge).  So you can see why this would never work if you were solo (if not, read this paragraph till you do see).  Your partner druid/shaman stands behind you and pisses the wolves off by SOWing you the first round, and healing and buffing you each other round.  Now the 20 wolves chasing you have TWO aggro targets, you and your partner.  So when 4 come into your melee range, the 16 that would normally walk away instead begin chasing your partner (they're ignoring you because there are already 4 in your melee range).  This means that 4 are in your melee range and can be hit by thunderclap, and 16 are running through your melee range to get to your partner, who is standing behind you in a perfect line with the wolves.  That means you can hit the 4 AND the 16.  Your partner standing behind you forces the wolves to run THROUGH you and thus get hit by your thunderclap spell.  You won't hit all of the wolves every time.  But at level 42, I was able to hit enough wolves each round to kill them all without going OOM.  I did have to use harvest once in a while.  My int is only around 160 or so.  If you have to use harvest, your partner will have to get the wolves on him and kite them around while you run to a safe spot up the coast and harvest.  If you don't understand how this would work, keep reading and hopefully you will.<br>
<br>
OK, so we left off with your partner in the spot, you 20 to 30 yards east of the spot, and the wolves further east (down the coast).  All three points (you, partner, and wolves) form a fairly straight line along the coast and you are facing the wolves.  As soon as you came into casting range, your partner cast SOW on you.  Now the wolves are pissed at both of you and they're running straight for you.  Again, your partner is hiding like a sissy behind you.  This is the tricky part.  You need to begin casting thunderclap at just the right time so that the spell completes just about the time the wolves are on you.  It's a much faster spell than COF, be sure to adjust accordingly.  This bit of tricky timing sounds hard, but I assure you that I am not a video game prodigy and I was able to get this timing down to fairly consistent after only a few tries of the spell.  Note too that PBAOE spells need no target.  They radiate out from you and hit all mobs around you regardless of your current target.<br>
<br>
That is the basis of the method.  You could probably figure out the rest for yourself, but I'll finish explaining as a formality and for those going &quot;WTF?  Now what?  Now you both stand there and you're dead?&quot;.<br>
<br>
As soon as those wolves get to YOU, your partner needs to run his ass up the coast as fast as he can and not stop to look back.  You need to FIRST run away from the coast to get away from the wolves, THEN follow your partner up the coast.  Your partner runs up the coast and you run up the coast also, but you stay close to the wolves.  Eventually the wolves will forget him and will stick to you because he's so far away.  If your partner is a very good gamer, he'll know when there are no more wolves on him without stopping (turn and run backward quickly or F9 momentarily.  My regular partner actually hits 'i' momentarily because the inventory view shows what's behind you).  MOST people cannot do this though from what I've found.  The best thing to do is just tell your partner to keep running until you tell him to stop.  Toward the beginning of the fight, you won't have to run far because the wolves won't be too mad at your partner.  Toward the end of the fight, the heals will start to add up and the wolves will get angry at him.<br>
<br>
As soon as all the wolves are off your partner and on you, you need to run back down the coast PAST the spot and circle around so that you're facing the spot.  You run up the coast toward the spot just like you did the first round.  You partner should already be back at the spot by the time you're ready to INC the second round.  This time, when you come into your partner's casting range, he doesn't cast SOW, he casts heal if you need it.  If you have less than 90% health, he needs to heal you.  If you're above 90% health, I recommend a regen.  You get into position, form that straight line along the coast with your partner behind you, you facing east, and the wolves coming for you both.  You time your thunderclap spell, take your hits, and run your ass up the coast until all wolves are off your partner just as before.  You do this until all the wolves are dead.<br>
<br>
I died the first time I tried this and I haven't died since.  I've done this successfully about 2 or 3 dozen times with 28 dire wolves being my record (with Yano).<br>
<br>
Note: make sure that you run AWAY from the coast after your thunderclap goes off.  The wolves will have spread out in a bit of a line that stretches between you and your partner and if you run straight up the coast, you'll be running within that line of wolves.  You'll be running INTO more wolves.  You need to run AWAY from the coast first, THEN run up the coast after your partner, going slower than him and staying close to the wolves until they're all aggroed on you.<br>
<br>
Note:  If you cast too late, the wolves will hit you once and have time to hit you a second time before thunderclap goes off.  Wolves double hit, so you'll have 4 wolves hitting you for a total of 8 potential hits.  Then you'll get hit a SECOND time with 8 potential hits.  You don't want this to happen.  You only want to take 1 round of hits for each round of thunderclap.  It's important to be aware of the first time the wolves hit you and get away BEFORE they can hit you a second time.<br>
<br>
Note:  Stuns are a bitch.  They're very rare with wolves though and I've never been killed from one.  One stun brought me down to a little over a bubble of HP, but I lived.<br>
