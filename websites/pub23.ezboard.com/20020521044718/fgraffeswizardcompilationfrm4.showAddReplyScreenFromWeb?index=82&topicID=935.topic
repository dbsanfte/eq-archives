I read a post a bit back on another board.  This person said (in several posts) that as an Enchanter she felt that Dire Charm was way over-powered.  That's fine and good... until you look at her signature and see that her Enchanter is level 40.<br>
<br>
You really have no idea what the end game is like until you've experienced it first hand, that is the truth.  Obvioulsy there are some exceptions, but they aren't extrodinarily common.<br>
<br>
Seriously, a Level 54 Wizard telling me how the end game works and how much Lure of Ice sucks (yes, I had it happen) makes me laugh.  Until you have played in the end game you really can't know what's going on, especially when most of your assumptions are just that... assumptions.<br>

I didn't have the pleasure of reading Smarty's first post before he edited, but it I gather that it was regarding him posting negative comments on the Druids Grove feedback thread from Rich Waters, and those posts being deleted.<br>
<br>
The thread got hijacked fairly early on, about the 4th post down. That's how the whole discussion about druids came in. And that's why you see druid posting here defending their class. <br>

No one wants to play a class to 60, spending 100s of days playing and investing 3 years of time into their class to be told that all their effort is wasted, they get to suck now. Except maybe a few like Leopa.<br>

Hmmm. I posted on that first page shortly after that, and at that time, we were still discussing 50+ life in general. Message board threads aren't like a game of Tag, where touching home base first somehow means you get to set the agenda. And as a moderator of the Druid's Grove, Foxfyre absolutely understands that, but chose to ignore it here. She's a very small person, but I guess that's her problem.

Whizbang, this is the Rant forum, and if I post here, I don't have to be civil, but if Leopa is so crushed that I said she was an idiot, then she should stop frequenting the Rant board or grow a thicker skin.

This applies to the endgame. Notice she said &quot;50+&quot; to include herself in that picture, but she has a level 54 druid, so what the hell does she know about 59-60 gameplay? <br>

Again, this is true in principle, but not in practice. How exactly do you keep a 60 cleric alive with your 60th heal? I'm sure your 54 druid can tell us. <br>

Actually druids are still needed as backup healers for endgame encounters in raiding guilds. Second, this is your misguided opinion on game design because the devs on the EQ Live team don't feel this way and are currently assessing casters for game balance. So, in the end, the game designers' opinion is what matters to the player community.<br>

She said she had zero problems with druids going the way of the dinosaur 50+, so in essence, it is her opinion that 50-60, which includes the endgame, can be devoid of a class.<br>

I was justifying why druids should never get complete heals. I felt druids should not ask for complete healing when they need to focus on healing clerics and non-tanks (by this, I mean warriors in case you want to define that as casters). Complete Healing is a class defined ability for clerics. And as for healing a 60 cleric ... if the 60th level heal isn't working, then revert back to the 54th level heal, I guess! I have not had a problem thus far in healing a 60 cleric during level 54 and I do not have difficulty hitting the &quot;Please assist me in healing %T&quot; hotkey for other druids and shamans on the raid to pitch in if it gets to that point.<br>

Actually druids are still needed as backup healers for endgame encounters in raiding guilds. Second, this is your misguided opinion on game design because the devs on the EQ Live team don't feel this way and are currently assessing casters for game balance. So, in the end, the game designers' opinion is what matters to the player community.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I don't begrudge druids getting upgraded heals, but my ORIGINAL post did state we were overpowered. I listed all the spells we had. If VI took away our ports and tracking (or snare and heals), for example, we'd be a more balanced class overall compared to other classes. Not perfectly balanced, of course, but it'd be a start. If Verant intended for druids to be secondary healers, they should focus on that rather than give us all the other luxury spells we have. There's a lot of class envy with druids precisely because of that. Why are we deserving to be overpowered? Why should we continue to be overpowered all the way to level 60? We have all the spells we need at our disposal with the exception of clarity and summon corpse and rez. If we're gonna have all those spells, then I'm not about to advocate that more healing spells should be added at our convienence. An upgrade, sure, but not complete heal, no. The class is spoiled enough as it is.<br>

Your problem is that you assume druids want Complete Heal. In all the class talks up to draft 3.0 there has never been any mention, desire, or request for Complete Heal.

Pre-Kunark druids were intended as more than secondary healers. You need to go back and ask yourself why druids' skin line has never stacked with clerics' buffs, not counting the Symbol line. Where is the context for your assessments???<br>

First of all, where are you getting this moronic idea that the druid community is asking for CH? Go read the thread I linked earlier in this one, it's not on the list. Ports? Who gives a shit about ports? You don't evac out of raids, wizards are always doing transes, when I ask who wants ports out when a raid is over I get maybe 2-3 tells because everyone rather be transd to bind or to some wizard trans location. They don't factor into shit. They're a MINOR convenience.<br>
<br>
Fact is our heals are complete SHIT at 60, it's a battle just to heal casters. I don't care that you might think we're overpowered, I'm not flaming because your opinion is differant. I'm flaming because it's completely WRONG, and based off some assinine assumption that we want CH apparently.<br>

With the exception of Circle Of Seasons, and the Ro's line, druids do exist to heal and nothing else in the end game, and even most of the high end game, at least the one I played from 50-60.

I would very much like a list of specific reasons why druids are overpowered. Tracking means jack shit, SoW? It's an AA ability, and a VP sword, and a potion. Heals? HAHA Nukes?

<br>
See, thats the shit that I hate.<br>
<br>
I get tells from my level 59 wizard friends and you know what they say &quot;/cry wizards are useless until level 60&quot; <br>
<br>
Most of the time I want to respond with &quot;Shut the Fuck Up and stop crying your ass off&quot;<br>
<br>
If by level 45 you haven't realized that your chosen class sucks shit in certain circumstances, you are a goddamn fucking moron.<br>
<br>
I don't see Warriors going &quot;goddamn, my life sucks until level 60 because I'm missing that last Disc, and can't use aggressive&quot;  <br>
<br>
Druids are one of the most usefull classes in the god damned game.  <br>
<br>
And for those that are fucking illiterate, I did not say &quot;end game&quot; I did not say &quot;late game&quot; I said none of those, because I mean OVERALL, from 1-60.  Some classes are NOT raiding classes.  <br>
<br>
One of my friends had a 56 Druid, but he realized that he had more fun raiding and his class wasnt very usefull at raiding.  Did he go and spew bullshit on another classes boards about it? Fuck no, he started a Cleric, got his cleric to 30 and started a warrior on a 2nd Account.  He's played the cleric for a year, and the Cleric is level 60, and the Warrior is 58 (maybe 59 now).<br>
<br>
Every class has its faults.<br>
I'm not one of those people who bitch and moan because its difficult to get from level 1 to level 29 with a wizard.  Sure, I suggest changes, but I don't remember going to the druid boards and saying &quot;Fuck you, you don't understand my pain!&quot;<br>
<br>
Every class also has its 'unique' appeal (even if some of them suck)<br>
<br>
One of my close real life friends had a Mage pre-Kunark. He hit 50 before Kunark came out, and still felt somewhat usefull.  <br>
<br>
After Kunark came out he managed to get to 52 when he realized that his class had become something that he didnt want to play.  He started a Shaman, got to level 57, got his epic, and then real life caught up with him, so he sold his characters.  <br>
<br>
So heres the Deal: Don't fucking BITCH about your class being cum guzzling fuck-ups on MY GODDAMN BOARD, and I won't go post my thoughts on your shit-filled boards.<br>
<br>
You know where the goddamn exit is, get the fuck out. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4>Rant Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
