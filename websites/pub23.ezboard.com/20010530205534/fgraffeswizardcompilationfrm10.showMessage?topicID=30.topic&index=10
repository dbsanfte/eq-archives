You don't think wizards are needed for uber mobs???  What other class can land spells on them?  Just go and read the other whine boards and you will the see the necros and druids screaming about the fact that they can't hit the god or uber mobs such as Trak, Tal, Gore, Serv and the list goes on.<br>
<br>
I think we have to pick our battles carefully here.  What is the MOST important change we need?  <br>
<br>
-Fixing AE spells?<br>
-Bigger\better DD's?  <br>
-Faster Harvest or improved mana with harvest?<br>
-Fewer fizzles<br>
<br>
Perhaps we need to compile a list of issues, and then put up a vote on them.  Would be nice to see what everyone feels is our main set of issues that we are pursuing here.<br>

<br>
It also interrupts stuns, the maximum targets are 5, just five.  That's one more target.  None of that adds up to being enough, and every Wizard knows it.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;2. The clerics nuking for more at level 1 and 4. DROP IT.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Not going to.  Every level matters to ME, even if it doesn't to you.  If the level is so minor and insignificant than it doesn't matter if the damage is raised for Wizards.  This is poor design, and GZ didn't even know it was like this, it is a design flaw.  Either we do a full list of all bugs and problems or we don't, and I'm trying to compile a full list.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;3. The Cazic Gate- I dont know, but even at 24 I never had any problems with this spell, seriously. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Then you are the only Wizard in Norrath that was like this.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;4. The Mage DD at 34- Its supposed to be enough to last them till 44, they DONT get an upgrade at 39.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Sorry, but Magicians try this.  Look over the spell list.  They OFTEN get a bolt the same level we get DD, and they ALWAYS have to wait 10 levels for their next blast, its standard for the class.  ONLY at this level is the damage different.  Wizards should not be out blasted by any class with a single blast at the same level, its just bottom line.  This was a design mistake that Verant tries to cover up as if it was intentional.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;5. I dont know a whole lot about it, but you might want to reconsider the druid DD at level 4, because you admit yourself its highly resistable, only outdoors, etc etc.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Again, if it is acceptible for them to do that kind of damage, then why isn't it for us?  If they can EVER do a blast that big, then that damage is within the range Verant is willing to accept a class doing.  If any class would do that damage with a Direct Damage spell, it should be Wizards.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;6. Gravity Flux- who realy cares?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well I do, and most enchanters think it is truly bizarre.  Actually if you think about it GF has some tactical uses you probably haven't considered.  It has a HUGE radius and hits 5 targets, it is like an Al'Kabor spell.  Again if you really want a full list of issues, this has to be on it.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Oh and someone said that VI have explained how brainbite is a 50 spell at level 39 to help us with fizzle rates. This I don't buy as at 49 I don't have a problem with IC fizzling. I think some appologist wizard made up that excuse and then people latched onto it as gospel. I read a lot of the official boards and don't recall ever hearing this stated.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You are exactly right, someone defending Verant's position on Wizards (there are some to whom Verant's every act is golden) came up with this.  But its junk, by the time you have one bubble of experience you won't be fizzling the spells as much as you did at first.  One level is well more than enough, because of the way fizzles work (its based on your skill vs the maximum skill the level you get the spell and your INT).<br>
<br>
So its not a case of fizzles, its a case of them creating a quest and being unhappy with how people are too clever at solving their puzzles.  So they made it so hard nobody can get it at level 39 unless they go with a guild full of 50s.<br>

True it may seem something out of place to give enchanters an AE that wizards get a circle later, but really think about it, it's not a typical AE spell.  It has more of a 'reality warping' feel to it, which doesn't feel so out of place for enchanters, at least in my opinion, and it's not such a class staple type of spell that getting it at 44 instead of 39 disadvantaged us, so this is one I'm not so worried about.  <br>
<br>
(On an wild tangent hehe, thanks to the enchanter version being 39, their research for it was more easily obtainable, which mattered back when 44 and 49 runes were almost as rare as the cazic skin is now *grin* hehe, so it was the enchanters getting their version first that made the spell even accessable for me.

<br>
Ok, I know for a fact I have hit 6 targets with an Al Kabor spell before, this was very long ago, before I realized just how horrible on mana they were, but I used one quite a while when I didnt have any recent pillar spells, and I know I hit 6 targets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;2. The clerics nuking for more at level 1 and 4. DROP IT.&gt;&gt;<br>

&lt;&lt;Not going to. Every level matters to ME, even if it doesn't to you. If the level is so minor and insignificant than it doesn't matter if the damage is raised for Wizards.

<br>
This is the kind of crap that Verant has been talking about. Yes a lot of the company is ass backwards, and they need a lot of work, but for god's sakes, you get to level 2 in 5 kills, you get to level 4 in like 4 hours.  Yes, it woud be just a simple matter of going into the spelldat file and adding 2 or whatever to the wiz DD, but ITS NOT WORTH IT, geez you dont see the necros or shamans or anyone else coming up with stuff about levels 1-4, they arent worth it.  You really still wont accept it? Fine wizards are meant to be hard to get started, they have to work for their power blah blah blah blah friggidy blah.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;3. The Cazic Gate- I dont know, but even at 24 I <br>
never had any problems with this spell, seriously. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Then you are the only Wizard in Norrath that was like this.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I dont really appreciate you editing my comments as much as you did, taking out my explanation of WHY I never had any problems with it, but regardless, instead of asking them to actually move the portal and such, try a different approach at least, ask them to remove the 2 lizards that wander the tp pad area, or just make those 2 into broodlings or something.  Because they have stated that they cant (ok wont, same diff) move the tp pad because it has to do with rewriting the whole zone's geometry, which means a large download.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;4. The Mage DD at 34- Its supposed to be enough to last them till 44, they DONT get an upgrade at 39.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Sorry, but Magicians try this. Look over the spell list.

Wizards should not be out blasted by any class with a single blast at the same level, its just bottom line. This was a design mistake that Verant tries to cover up as if it was intentional.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
So the one time that they dont get a new bolt or blast we should tell them tough shit, your bolt from 34 will still be weaker? And still, honeslty, its 16 points of damage! If they were doing level 39 type damage with their bolt then yes I would agree, but I was never turned down due to a mage's bolt doing 16 more damage than me, this is the kind of nit picky crap that so few people care about that arguing about it makes you look like a zealot, you make many valid points, but when you argue for 3 points of damage at level 1, or 16 points of damage at level 34, it discredits you a lot.  And you still have to look at the bigger picture of cast time, hold time, etc, you cant only look at pure figures and extrapolate, your arguing that preachers cause alcoholism.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;5. I dont know a whole lot about it, but you might want to reconsider the druid DD at level 4, because you admit yourself its highly resistable, only outdoors, etc etc.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Again, if it is acceptible for them to do that kind of damage, then why isn't it for us? If they can EVER do a blast that big, then that damage is within the range Verant is willing to accept a class doing. If any class would do that damage with a Direct Damage spell, it should be Wizards.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Read above, preacher alcoholic etc.<br>
<br>

It has a HUGE radius and hits 5 targets, it is like an Al'Kabor spell. Again if you really want a full list of issues, this has to be on it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I have considered them, and at 39 GF does too much damage to actually Gflux jump your way around, you kill yourself way to fast.  And Gflux is horribly mana efficient unless somehow you get the mob to fall further than his starting point, which meas its really not viable for hunting or kiting.  Anyhting else I havent though about please tell me what uses for it I have overlooked.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Oh and someone said that VI have explained how brainbite is a 50 spell at level 39 to help us with fizzle rates. This I don't buy as at 49 I don't have a problem with IC fizzling.

<br>
<br>
This is partly my fault, I did not make myself clear. Whether another wizard actually started the &quot;rumor&quot; or not, the first time I heard it, it was news I believe on castersrealm, in one of those sessions where they cover like 30 different things.  I did not claim that I actually thought it should be level 39, even if they want to argue that it should be a very early level, then it should be like MAYBE 44, my point is Im trying to tell you what VI will tel you, so you can prepare a rebuttle.  I can see that you have, in a way, with your thing about fizzle rates based on skill, etc.  But, and I may be mistaken, but I believe at least on a minor scale, fizzles are determined slightly by the level of the spell.  This might only be on terms with how much dex effects proccing and such, but if it affects it at all, VI will be sure to point that out to you.  For the record Id love to see this quest be made doable to a 39, as Im 51 and still dont have it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this was and still is all meant as contructive, if albeit harshly worded, critisicsm. Yes my spelling and punction suck.<br>

I sat with the raiders in South Karana and grouped them up in a tight pile, all 8 of them in a bunched up area and cast every Al'Kabor we get.  I got exactly 5 hits every single cast, no more, no less.  That's how I know it hits 5 guys.  Gravity Flux does too.<br>
<br>
You seem to be willing to dismiss the damage differences, but you know what?  You are in the vast minority.  Wizards are supposed to be the best at DD, with nobody close.  Well, Verant won't make us the best with no rivals, but we sure as hell can fight to make us at least slightly better.  You want to discuss casting times and mana efficiency?  OK lets talk about ALL the issues then, throw in a Magician using ALL his best tools and us using ALL our best tools.  Now they out damage us in 1-2 casts at ALMOST ALL spell levels, are you happier?<br>
<br>
Again, if this was an issue for Magicians, it would be true every single level they get a bolt and we get a blast, that is not a valid argument.  Our blast should be higher than their bolt, bottom line, and these issues I will never, ever drop.<br>
<br>
Why?  Because the reason groups really look at Wizards isn't fast damage, we can't DO fast damage in 99% of the fights (you blast constantly as fast as you can do you?  Neither do any of us).  They look at things like evac and snare.  But we aren't supposed to be the class known for snaring and evaccing, we are supposed to be fast burners, nukers, the cannon.  <br>
<br>
What bothers me most is that even Clerics and Druids nod and say &quot;you got something there&quot; when I point out that if Verant finds it acceptible for someone to do that much damage at any point, then it should be ok for Wizards to do at least that much... since that is our specialty.  Yet you only seem to want to answer with wierd, cryptic non applicable analogies and dismissal as if it doesn't matter.  It does, every bit of it matters.<br>
<br>
So every single little baby step we take to make that more so is a step in the right direction.<br>
<br>
The reason I edited your comments is to keep the post from being 98028 pages long, not because I was trying to censor you.  I was putting the basic statement down and responding to it, its not like people can't scroll up and look.<br>
<br>
Regarding Cazic Thule, that is an option, probably better than moving the port (although I would still argue it is a retarded place to put a teleport - imagine how Druids would complain if their circle was dumped in the middle of Lower Guk or something?).  But the fact is, every Wizard who walks the planet knows that is a lethal, awful place to teleport into.<br>
<br>
The only way anyone can move into there safely is if they know ahead of time what is up, get very lucky, and have everything prepared just right.  That isn't how a teleport should work, is it?<br>
<br>
And finally, the fizzle rumor was started right here on Graffe's board and was answered by me, quoting GZ on fizzles the very next message.  Sadly though, people don't seem to remember that one, just the junk about it being higher level.  My opinion is they wanted it rare, and didn't want many Wizards having it.
