If you make it harder, a great number of those guilds that have a shot at this will no longer be able to complete it.  Also keep in mind that mudflation will occur, so you'd have to constantly retune it to make it &quot;hard&quot;.  When the cleric epic was first put in, the three main encounters were plenty hard.<br>
<br>
When the epics were first put in, a ton of clerics were stuck on Ragefire on E'ci, since there were plentiful public King and BW raids... we were often able to get 10 or so clerics their elementals done each evening every week or so, and regular king raids.  So the number of people that got their epics before the logjam, at least on our server, was pretty minimal.<br>
<br>
As for spawn numbers, all I can do is report what I see.  While Ragefire could spawn 24 hours or so after Naggy, he often wouldn't respawn until 3 to 4 days after that kill, so there was rarely a third Ragefire before Naggy spawned and started the timer over again.  It basically came down to 2 Rages per week, I've helped out on a number of camps and the average camp was 3-4 days each time.  Often getting 4 each week?  Man, you must have some weird mob timers on your server...<br>
<br>
As for Ragefire in 7 days in Skyfire... well, we've been making a push to finish off our cleric epics lately, and his spawn windows are turning out to be significantly less than 7 days from what I can tell.  May be luck, might not be, can't say for certain as I've only been messing around with the Skyfire camp for the last 2 or 3 weeks off and on. <p><a href="http://www.reconstructed.nu/profile.php?pid=119">Master Aledar Boomcaster</a><br>Sorcerer of <a href="http://www.reconstructed.nu/">Reconstructed</a>, E'ci<br><img src="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~bwa/bunnypet.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urombusmindspire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rombus Mindspire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Moderator</font></td></tr></table><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Verant's #1 Fanboy</font></td></tr></table><br><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif><a href=mailto:rombus@graffe.com style=text-decoration: none><font color=#FFFFFF>Contact Rombus</font></a></font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/02 9:39:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17942.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.tritonguild.com/rombus/sidepic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cleric epic</span><hr size=1> Fynal:<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I just disagree with Rombus stating that they did not decrease the spawn rate and saying that he is just as frequent. Because that is simply a lie.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Adon, first of all those quotes (and note the date... 02-11-2002) show a lot of speculation based on peoples initial reactions to the new Ragefire spawn.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the spawn rate was tuned a few times shortly after it was moved to Skyfire.  Oh, and just because I don't know everything about the Ragefire camp doesn't mean that I don't know as much about Clerics as I do about Wizards.  I can assure you that I know quite a bit about Clerics and have been playing one for a very, very long time... probably longer than yourself.  In fact, my first character was a Cleric and he was my main for a bit; then I switched to Rombus. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
As far as SolB Rage goes... as I said <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> EXPERIENCES I'VE HAD ON POVAR</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Ragefire was most certainly *NOT* a 3-4 in one week camp when it was in SolB.  Maybe if you got lucky... but that certainly was not common.  Typical spawn time on him was once every 3 days (and he spawned typically 24-48 hours after Naggy died as well it seemed).  Now in Skyfire the last four Cleric epics we've done we've gotten within 72 hours.  Another took like a week but it was because the server came down every day. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We had actually alternated between 5 different guilds doing the Skyfire camp in (get this, it basically says you're wrong) just over two weeks.<br>
<br>
To be honest there is really no proof pointing either way to show 100% that the spawn rate was infact decreased from its SolB form, so don't &quot;lie&quot; and act like there is.  Peoples assumptions != facts.  Oh, and I'm sorry I should have said in my initial post that his spawn rate didn't appear to change, not that it didn't.  On that same note you should have said &quot;Rombus you're wrong, I'm fairly confident it was changed&quot; instead of the childish replies containing &quot;What are you smoking&quot; &quot;you're lying&quot; and other unneeded insults. <br>
<br>
One thing I will say is that when it was initially put in I swear it was around a 24 hour spawn (i remember doing him daily at one point) and they played with it somewhere in between.  The SolB one that is, not the SKyfire one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> There is just no truth in what Rombus said about the spawn time. Maybe one day he will *gasp* admit he was wrong about something...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Maybe if you payed attention to these boards rather than just coming here looking for a fight you'd find that I admit when I'm wrong about something often.  When you can provide me with solid evidence that his spawn rate was decreased I'll admit I was wrong.  So far everything on Povar says it's the same as it always was except for maybe in the beginning. *shrug* or should I say *gasp* <br>
<br>
Adon, you need to work on your people skills, you come off as nothing but insulting lately.  I remember when you used to be a nice guy too, that's the sad thing.  Now all you like to do is pick fights it seems. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/unagrak.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nagrak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/26/02 10:04:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17942.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cleric epic</span><hr size=1> For what it's worth, Drinal is now using a 'list' system for Rage, and the current pop timer will tick over to 6 full days within the hour.<br>

I'm just glad I decided to play a wizard instead of a cleric.  If I had to 'hold a camp' for 6+ days straight I'd never have gotten my epic, as I work full time, and at least make some attempt at having a life beyond work and Everquest.<br>
<br>
I cannot give away my account password to others, so I'd just be SOL on a camp like this.<br>

I agree with the 'epics should be hard' folks, but I totally disagree with the Ragefire bottleneck and camp from hell.<br>

<br>
For instance, the Cleric Epic itself is a badly designed quest from the beginning.  If you look at the Monk epic for example, whats the monk doing in the Epic?  He's being a monk, duh!  he's pulling mobs, he has to split mobs, he has to wait for a powerful mob and pull it to his friends, they whack him and voila ... bubbles! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Ok, it's not quite that simple, but if you look at Monk epic from start to finish it's REALLY well designed and the entire quest seems to make sense, and in fact the monks are beginning on their Epic journey from the orc pawn they kill to earn their newbie headband.  Thats what should have been put in on all the classes.<br>
<br>
Whats a Cleric do for his epic?  Duo's with a druid in the underwater tower, solo's the Sol A goblin, the Ragefire battle itself is usually over so fast (now) that maybe one CHeal might go off, pretty uncommon to see RF live long enough for the MT to need 2 cheals, Ixiblat is really the same as RF only easier.  And King note... one fight in the entire epic that acutally required (note past tense) the Cleric to be a Cleric and heal people in an intense fight.  Now people can get ally faction though and coh all the way to royals or even possibly pull Royals out to a much safer area. <br>
<br>
<br>
As to the spawn, yes the spawn was a little wonky after they moved RF to SF from Sol B.  It wasnt going as intended and they had to play with it a bit, they admitted this at Fan Faire and kept at it until they had him spawning where they wanted him in regards to frequency.  Something people are forgetting though is that on many servers Sol B can be a twitchy zone, and when Rage was there, a server pop or zone pop (which for some reason about a year ago, Sol B was going down all the time it seemed) meant that Naggy had to be killed again and then the timer would start all over on RF.  So you could theoretically get 3 epics in a week, you could also go a week and half with no epics because of a buggy zone and the fact that you had to wait for a newbie guild or alts to kill Nagafen.<br>
<br>
Ragefire is triggered, Verant has always maintained that.  Problem is they consider the Vendor to be the trigger and once you hand him pearl you have therefore &quot;triggered&quot; the Ragefire encounter.  Symantics.  RF the dragon spawn may be triggered but RF the human vendor is still a meaningless timesink camp that could be triggered ala the little dorf in Hidden Oasis for Druid epic.  <br>
<br>
I agree with previous posters that the mark of the epics should be your part in the community (your guild) and your friends desire to come together to help you.  Ragefire should not be any harder than Wizard, Druid, Monk, or Rogue quests.  You think that clickstick is powerful because guilds can Zerg rush a mob? thats something Verant can deal with by tuning a mob so Zerg tactics dont work on him, (read Sontalak, not that they need to go to that extreme, but they have the ability to change mobs to make them stronger against zergling rushes) <br>
<br>
There are other issues with the Cleric epic as well but I feel that mainly Verant doesnt need to be quite so restrictive on the flow of click sticks.  L60 clerics leave the game too, maybe even more often than other classes because of the frustration with what can be a very stressful and unrewarding job.  Clerics are there to let everyone else have fun.  While everyone else is busy nuking, piercing, and slashing away having a blast, clerics are staring at a wall or trying to stay awake through the monotony and hit macro button #3 for cheal chain and praying lag doesnt make them late and they get blamed for a loss in a big fight.<br>
<br>
The original intent of this thread is valid, although the spawn timer issue has been addressed Cleric epic still boils down to a few meaningless camps and then one that has a history of causing nothing but trouble and strife.  You can argue that it's the players that create the trouble and strife but that doesnt do anything to address the situation that the PnP, the failure of GM's and Guides to take action when mobs are KS'd, the tactic of snare kiting vs first in force, and one long bottleneck after an otherwise easy path of progression through this epic have created the envioronment that griefers take advantage of.  Servers with lists that act with a sense of community have Clerics standing in line for a YEAR to get their RF battel.  Thats amazing.  <br>
<br>
I think there should be a second Ragefire in VP that is triggered with hailing him or handing in the pearl to a static NPC vendor, meaning actually triggered for real this time.  This VP version would allow upper teir guilds that have no trouble doing VP to go in and whack him, get their cleric epic done and get out.  It also validates the reason to get a VP key, puts guilds back in an under utilized zone, and gets some loots out to people that often go overlooked because melee's tend to not want to go to VP because they can get better loot faster from vastly easier mobs.  This alternative would solve a lot of problems for Verant in a way I think they would find acceptable.<br>

<br>
On first possible moment of Ragefire spawn:<br>
<br>
3 Guilds were sitting there in full force, 1 of them was able to do NToV with that Force, 1 of them was able to do HoT with that force and one was able to do Chardok King with that force.<br>
<br>
2 days later, one of the guilds were still there, a fourth guild had joined already and another had left. Zordak popped, died within 10 seconds, ragefire popped, died withing 20 seconds. The FCFS rule would allow the kill to those that first tagged the mob (about 4 level 60 shadowknights hitting the HT button to tag ) One guild got the xp from the kill, but due to some cybering for the GM the epic drop was placed on another cleric. <br>
<br>
This has been te situation for some time now, and it will continue this way on a server where a large part of the population is either reaching level 60 or is playing their 3rd alt to 60.<br>
<br>
I would think that in this situation, a triggered garanteed spawn in a zone as Veeshans peak, behind some named, would remove the high end guilds out of the race for this spawn. The cleric epic would either become the Ragefire/zordak camp or it would be getting a VP key for your cleric and enough help to go there. <br>

<br>
Ok, that's a good point. Maybe the problem of newer guilds competing against old guilds is worse on Xev because it's split. But doesn't Povar ever have new guilds form? <br>
<br>
Four Elements is a healthy guild. We're far from uber, but we've started tackling some more difficult encounters and we're growing all the time. If we only had to compete against other sub-uber growing guilds it wouldn't be such a problem, we have as much of a chance to mobilize for Ragefire as anyone else. Guilds like Harmonium, Sovereign's Might, and others however, are level 60 guilds that pretty much raid all the time. If Ragefire pops they're going to have more people online with nothing to do and likely to get there quickly.<br>
<br>
Right now one of our clerics is camping Ragefire. I fully expect that when Rage pops there will be some kind of dispute.<br>
<br>
No, that's not true at all. That's why you have a guild and friends. We have many Clerics who are mothers / fathers / students / whatever and they didn't spend their entire time sitting in front of the PC. They went AFK and left the PC on for hours at a time, they had their guildmates take watches, they had their trusted guildmates log them in to loot the piece when Ragefire did spawn...<br>

Well, any time an epic discussion starts (any epic not just cleric), two things are usually said:<br>
<br>
1. Epics are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> supposed</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be hard<br>
2. Not everyone is supposed to get an epic<br>
<br>
I agree with the first, but I think the second is arrogant and elitist.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<br>
I didn't say I didn't think it wasn't powerful, just that it isn't the most powerful. I mean, come on, for the time spent <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> on a game</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> bits in a database</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> it needs to be powerful.<br>
<br>
I agree the cleric epic is nice and powerful and useful to the guild <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> as a whole</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (which is why it's so desired), but it's not the game-breakingly powerful artifact that some people like to think it is.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
By what you've just said that means that no epic is powerful. Wizards can already rune, Mages can already summon pets, Necros and Druids can already snare, Warriors can already taunt and do damage, Rangers can already gain agro, Enchanters can already haste, Beastlords can already slow, Shamans can already DoT. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ok, here's my opinion of the epics:<br>
<br>
Wizard: On it's own, powerful but not uber. In the right situations (old world zone with a manastone) it's kind of disgusting.<br>
<br>
Mage: Yes mages can summon pets, but no mage spell-summoned pet will ever be as powerful as the epic pet (at least until planes of power <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). Mages with epic pets can do things that mages without epic pets can't. That's why I say it's the most powerful.<br>
<br>
Monk: Right click spell-haste in a hand item. From what I understand many monks feel there is no better upgrade to the hand slot for a monk.<br>
<br>
Bard: SSS allows bards to twist songs that normally require an instrument and still melee.<br>
<br>
Necro, Druid, and Shaman: Nice, mana free dots. But, at least in the case of Necros, not even their most powerful dots. Good epics, but don't really change the way they play the game.<br>
<br>
Warriors, Rangers, Paladins, SKs, and probably beastlords: Weapons with procs. Good weapons, but destined to be replaced.<br>
<br>
Enchanters: Similar to clerics, but only melee benefit from it, plus casting haste is not nearly as downtime inducing as casting rez.<br>

I had anticipated you saying those posts were out of date, so I included one from yesterday, June 26, 2002.<br>
<br>
Here is the thread from eqclerics. Your personal experience, by the way, != the truth, since there is a random timer.  The cleric community however, has learned the truth in the spawn timer.<br>
<br>

The week I got my epic from Ragefire, Aanja (Lumiere Divine), Myself (then Spirit of Fire), Haletma (SoF), and Hannem (SoF) all got our epics from one Ragefire.  It was quite common for a guild to raid naggy on server up with alts, then spend one hellish week knocking off 4 cleric epics with a 24-7 FG camp.<br>
<br>
This is no longer possible since 2 Ragefires in one week is now most common, with rarely 1 Ragefire per week and 3.<br>

<br>
<br>
one simple thing here PROVE IT.  you cant cause its a random spawn.  And please quit the bitching about spawn times.  Every epic has its bottlenecks.  Thats why they are epics and not Fine steel drops.  The only reason so many clerics complain about rage is cause for the most part the rest of the epic is a cakewalk for any good guild.  The spawn are all multiple trys per day.  <br>
<br>
Other epics.  Warriors- green scale what is it now 1 mabe 2 a week if you are lucky<br>
<br>
bards- white scale- due to recent vox changes got easier but still a pain<br>
<br>
monks- no real bottleneck all of it is fairly easy saving the rare chardok pipe from what i have seen<br>
<br>
druids and rangers nothing really too bad except stone from hate<br>
<br>
rogue- hands down easiest epic out there<br>
<br>
mages- try camping that damn pegasus in SK and then tell me rage is a pain<br>
<br>
SK- 30+ fear raids with over 50 golem kills and never seen that sk blade drop<br>
<br>
Wizards my bread and butter-  Try stating 3 broken golems were killed in a week.  it doesnt happen that is our biggest bottle neck we just dont complain cause the other 2 staffs are not easy to get either 36 phinny raids in a row before my staff droped.  yes that was 36 spawns in a row at average of 11 hour respawn.  i got lucky with VS got that one on my 3rd raid first times staff dropped.<br>
<br>
BL pali, and necro I have no real experience with so I wont comment<br>
<br>
<br>
point of all this is its a epic all of them suck and they are not made for casual gamers who play a hour or 2 a night a couple nights a week.  They are long boring camps that are frustrating and push to to the break of wanting to quit at times.  If you think the camp is too long or the spawn time is too slow..... then dont get it.<br>
<br>
And until you have hard factual data about the 6 month durration of rage spawns before and after the move dont make a open comment like you know for a fact it was changed its random.  mabe you are unlucky now.  I know before it was moved I sat in solb with my monk for a cleric friend for over 3 days and rage still didnt pop.  That was after waiting 2 days for naggy to go down that was 1 rage a week a far cry from 3.  At least you dont have to wait for naggy to die now and he is a guarnateed spawn that will not despawn.  (yes it happened to a raid on brell naggy poped as they were about to charge rage and everyone was sent to zone and rage despawned).<br>

Well, you said that a lot of people getting epics were alts, right?  That's not the case on Povar.  The majority of the Ragefire camps are still done by mains.  I'm not saying there aren't some alts who have done them, but it's mostly mains.<br>

I disagree, and I disagreed long before I had my epic.  Epics should be exclusive to those who want to work for it (that doesn't mean spending 6 days infront of a PC, but it doesn't mean running around triggering mobs either); that includes both &quot;uber&quot; and non-&quot;uber&quot; - it's an &quot;epic&quot; quest, it should be hard.  The problem you have here now is that something that's god-like for the mid-levels is a pushover for the &quot;ubers.&quot;  It's hard to balance this stuff with encounters so it leads to camps. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
My take on epics... the only ones that will never be banked are the Wizard, Mage, Bard and Cleric epics.  I think the only people in my guild who I see with their epics consistantly equipped are the Clerics (most have Blackstar or better though), Bards and Wizards.  <br>

Again, sounds like amazing luck, that's all and nothing more.  I personally have never heard of more than 2 Ragefires in a week with the SolB method except at the very start.  Have you ever heard of 4 in a week since you got yours before it was switched to Skyfire?  Can you show me proof of this?  Every single Ragefire I camped in SolB (except at the start) always seemed to timeout to a max of 3 days, a couple went over by a little and one went for a week.<br>
<br>
That thread you included shows nothing but people making assumptions by the way.  I'm basing my theory off of the past few months of Skyfire camping on Povar.  One thing I will give you though is that it does seem it's more possible for Ragefire to go over the 3 day mark (typical spawn time on Povar has been 3-4 days) in Skyfire even though it doesn't happen that often.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> This is no longer possible since 2 Ragefires in one week is now most common, with rarely 1 Ragefire per week and 3.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well then you've just proved yourself wrong I'm afraid.  2-3 Ragefires a week in SolB was the most common occurance.  Just because you had 4 spawn in one week doesn't mean that it was common, remember that.  You keep jumping back to that and you really shouldn't because 4 Ragefires in 1 week is (face it) VERY lucky.  I mean, there are 7 days in a week that means that you had about 1 Ragefire spawn every 42 hours.  Wow, that really is amazing luck.<br>

I agree with that. The problem I have is this: Let's say for the sake of argument that Ragefire spawns once every 3 days. It doesn't matter how good a player you are, how committed to the game you are, how good or well-connected you guild is, only <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> one</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> cleric will be getting their epic in that 3-day period. You could be god's gift to EQ playing since beta, but if someone gets Ragefire during that spawn time before you you're shit out of luck. And I think that's a piss-poor way to run a game. Contested rare spawns are just not good for anyone.<br>

<br>
Want to talk about racing a whole zone to a mob that you can not track, that has a random spawn location, that the cloak you need is the rare drop from it, and the person looting it wants 1000's of plat and a power level to level 46 to hand it in if they will MQ it with you, if you don't beat them to the spawn.<br>
<br>
So RageFire is a wait in an open zone, compair that to getting to Drake Island in the Plane of Sky.<br>
<br>
Usual time is 3 days to get there, no epic needs past the Spiroc Island but the magician one, but we have to do it, and get a raid force group to help for what as I said is usually 3 days at a time<br>
<br>
Phinny in Kedge, well as all the wizards here can tell you, the drop for the wizards staff is as rare as the staff drop for the magician, and if it doesn't drop you redo it 11-12 hours later. 30+ times one person in the thread mention, and I am sure there are worse cases as well.<br>
<br>
Triggered spawns? none for the magician epic, but we do have a ultra rare drop in SolA, many magician's spend days just after this one item.<br>
<br>
Asking to make the cleric epic easier? Compair it to the mage epic, or hell just compair their whole epic to getting a wizard staff from Phinny for sheer anount of time spent on one mob. True some are lucky to get it on the 1st kill, some 30+ times for nothing. At least in SkyFire you are earning experience as you wait.<br>
<br>
As for a triggered spawn, in the magician epic there is none.<br>

<br>
That is what the Ragefire camp is, a KS contest<br>
<br>
On Povar attempts have been made to support a list for some time now.  The problem is, guilds that don't have problems taking the camp in force have no desire to consider any such formalities and just show up for the kill.<br>
<br>
My guild's cleric has been on that list for months.  He started camping Ragefire two spawns before his turn to ensure his position on the list.  I am not in a super powerful NToV capable guild, but we do have three Mana Burners and amassed a large turnout when Ragefire spawned.<br>
<br>
Sadly, a much larger guild was interested in the spawn and showed up with THEIR Mana Burners as well.  Even though I landed my largest non crit mana Burn to date (9400+ dmg) we didn't get the kill and so all of our cleric's time was wasted.<br>
<br>
This would have been my guild's first cleric epic.  The other guild has several.  Explain to me how the design for this quest is maintaining some sort of balance?  I fail to see it.<br>
<br>
/gesture to all of you that just say &quot;oh well, your guild is the weaker one and therefore you don't deserve the cleric epic because it is so wonderful it needs to be rare, blah blah blah&quot; that is an attitude that stems from your ability to KS anything that moves and/or your apathy towards the situation because your guild already has at least one cleric that managed to complete the quest.<br>
<br>
Verant needs to decrease respawn times if it wants to maintain a loyal high end customer base.  Period.<br>

<br>
People aren't against the idea of working for their epics.  People aren't complaining that the quests provide encounters that are too challenging as far as the player vs mob aspect is concerned.  What people are against is having to waste countless hours waiting for one single spawn to pop, and compete to do the most damage to that spawn than other interested parties before it dies and/or after it gets it's memory wiped and is KSed.<br>
<br>
KSing isn't cool no matter how you look at it, unless of course you are talking about a PvP server where you can actually &quot;fight&quot; over the right to loot.  This is poor game design plain and simple. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uajilon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ajilon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/28/02 12:27:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17942.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: enough is enough</span><hr size=1> It's a lot more than poor game design.  It's outright disrespect to the players.  In a thread on the Safehouse, Kendric referred to epics and said in hindsight he probably should have added a &quot;friction point&quot; into the rogues epic like the other classes have.  Well, isnt that grand.  /rude VI (specifically the teams that designed and those that approved the implementation of the Epic quests)<br>
