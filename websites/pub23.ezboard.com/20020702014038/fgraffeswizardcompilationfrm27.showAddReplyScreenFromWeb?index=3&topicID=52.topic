I'd prefer to keep bitching about it till it gets fixed. It is broken. The fact that pvp is broken in a lot of ways hardly excuses breaking it further. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Somewhat true, but why not fix the oldest broken things first, like melee discs for rogues etc? But of course that wouldnt be to your advantage. I personaly think that if they do any special modifications for pvp abbilities, then all of those that are unbalanced in pvp should be affected. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/upickkpockket999.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pickk Pockket999</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/6/02 10:42:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am sick and tired of people bitching about mb</span><hr size=1> What is it with people comparing duelist to mb?

Wanding someone back doesnt change that you are already dead.<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The range is short, and it takes 6 seconds (kinda far from instant).<br>
<br>
<br>
The main reason there are compares to specificly duelist is that there have been a rogue trolling the board about mb.<br>
To make some real comparison between duelist and mb in a rogue vs wiz fight.<br>
<br>
Advantages with mb:<br>
-Range, mb has greater range then duelist.<br>
<br>
-golem wand, not needed for mb against rogue, needed against well equiped wizard for duelist. <br>
<br>
Advantages for duelist:<br>
<br>
-Reuse time, 29mins vs 144mins.<br>
<br>
-Disadvantages after use , loss of all mana with mb, nothing for duelist. A rogue can keep fighting, wizard needs to get away somehow.<br>
<br>
-Casting time, 6 seconds for mb, instant for duelist.<br>
<br>
-Golem wand, 6second casting time doesnt combine well with using a wand on the target before you cast. Rogue with buffs may very well survive.<br>
<br>
Wich one is best? Thats a matter of oppinion, but in no way is mb massivly more unbalanced then duelist.<br>
<br>
As a side note, if comparing to other abbilities then I would gladly trade mb for HT. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukalliel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalliel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.planetadnd.com/ikonboard/avatars/firewizard.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/7/02 5:53:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://kalliel.freewebspace.com/images/eq_test.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am sick and tired of people bitching about mb</span><hr size=1> LMAO, finally Verant gives us a spell that shows how powerful a wizard is supposed to be and everyone is all up in arms about it....( Im soooo scared, its not fair, its a DT)..crapola.

<br>
Heres the thing... <br>
Mannaburn = sure kill, 4k dmg in ghetto gear even buffed I don't have enough to survive it let alone the 6k non crit that can be done with good gear. Its not hard to get a 6 second nuke off at the start of a fight. While you can avoid it by running there is a difference between a rogue running with a wizard trailing and the opposite situation.  The rogue is fleeing, the wizard is kiting.<br>
<br>
Duelist = chance to kill, unless you get snared which you shouldn't if you are apropriately geared. You should never take more than 1 round of duelist dmg ever.  Its simply to easy to move and avoid that dmg for there to be any excuse.  For that round to be dangerous it has to include a backstab attempt because a few duelist melee hits wont do that much dmg (hint don't show your back), If the rogue happens to get this round + bs in your still talking about 0-2 backstabs and 0-4 swings.  Note 1/3 of melee hits miss vs even con players who don't wear weak cloth ac. Also note double bs goes off roughly 40% at 55 and I think not more than 50% later on due to double attack skill going up.<br>
<br>
This means that with 50% doubles you get...<br>
<br>
23% no landed bses<br>
55% 1 landed bs<br>
22% 2 landed bses<br>
<br>
Add to that the fact that bses unlike lures usually don't hit for full (just a guess here but I'm guessing average dmg unbuffed will be 450-500) and consider the fact that if it almost kills but not quite the wizard has a good chance to yonder outdoors.  If indoors you will likely be able to flee due to the melee range issues.<br>
<br>
All in all its a great way to kill people that...<br>
<br>
You catch sitting.<br>
You stick poison to.<br>
<br>
Both scenarios are avoidable.<br>
<br>
Other than that duelist like earlier rogue discs should make a poor weapon to use as an opener unless your in a tight space surounded by agro mobs with nowhere to run to.<br>
<br>
It should be better as a finisher though.<br>
<br>
Also you can't exploit kill with duelist through 3 walls. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umoffonfurryhealer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Moffon Furryhealer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/7/02 1:15:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am sick and tired of people bitching about mb</span><hr size=1> The reason we(meaning people from RZ) do not like Manaburn so much is that there are wizards that manaburn someone, loot, gate to nexus, go afk until it recycles, gate down, manaburn, etc.  You think that's what it was intended for?

Oh, what about a Manaburn in a Dungeon ?  This is advantage Wizard ?  Only if I saw you first and hide..<br>

Trying to land 6 + lures on someone to kill them is so much more difficult than any challeng a melee has in killing me quickly, it is not even comprable.<br>

If you nerf manaburn, you also have to nerf all the other inherent unbalances that exist in higher level PvP...and there are many, and almost all favor melee's..and then there is the HUGE unbalancing of Melee gear in PvP vs Caster gear in PvP...can you say Fungi Tunic ?<br>
<br>
The melee's that are crying about it are, well, just simply spoiled.  Their perception is based upon what &quot;balance&quot; was prior to manaburn..which was not balance at all.<br>

Yeah, being chased by a wizard trying to cast 6 second spells must be realy scary for you. Maybe if he gets ahead of you and start casting when you get in range, then you wont be out of range before it resolves. Only way you can get killed is if you turn on autorun and go afk.<br>

<br>
Thing is a wizard being chased IS kiting he can and will try to get space between you and cast draughts or lures.<br>
<br>
A rogue being chased is just running for his life because he knows if he stops and tries to put up a fight hes as good as mannaburned and dead. This is why moving to avoid spell dmg is less viable then moving to avoid melee dmg. You can move to avoid melee dmg 100% of the time between casts and still fight.  We melees have to stick it out and stay close and try to interupt or else flee.  Moving to avoid nukes is only a strategy to avoid getting nuked before you can close the distance and start beating on the caster.  Clear enough yet?<br>
<br>
&quot;It takes far less costly gear to get to 4k buffed then it takes to be able to get max mb for 4k (it doesnt always hit for max to so sure is not the word to use).&quot;<br>
<br>
Epic + crafted hp rings + dwarf quest + various items wont get me much over 2k unbuffed at 60 as a rogue and or to around 3500 with cleric, shaman, ranger hp buffs and I really think in a 1 on 1 comparison the former total is a lot more meaningful.  In a 1 on 1 fight mannaburn even with ghetto gear will basicly always kill me. Fully buffed by 3 different classes I'm still basicly a twitching pile of overcooked meat if I get mannaburned by someone not on a corpse run.<br>
<br>
Regarding miss ratio.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, like casters you mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
I was actually talking about the cloth that drops in newbie zones rather than the cloth that drops in saaaay PoG, 2nd floor of hate, dwarf city quest. Idealy your gear when fighting a rogue consists of AC and hp + enough pr to resist poisons. There is no reason why you should run oom fighting a rogue unless you use a lot of resistable nukes on a guy with high fr cr.  I decently equiped caster has enough AC that the miss ratio should be signifigant. This is just how melee dmg works. Only green mobs allow you to hit most of time.<br>
<br>
&quot;You may not know about it, but casters have this skill called meditation that requires sitting. &quot;<br>
<br>
Amazing simply amazing. Thank you for enlightening me boy do I feel dumb here I was assuming that casters were just a bunch of lazy sons of bitches who sat on their asses all day.  Well genius I have a few tips for you...<br>
<br>
-Med with your back to a wall.<br>
-Watch the zone list for enemies.<br>
-Watch for people comming near that may be hostile.<br>
-Go into 3rd person view if it will help you keep watch.<br>
-Keep see invis up.<br>
<br>
No caster will take a sitting BS duelist or otherwise when he is paying attention.<br>
