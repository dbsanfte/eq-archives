Seriously, it doesn't always have to be one or extreme or the other (no cloning or everyone is identical). Reality, as is usually the case, will end up somewhere in between the extremes.<br>

Every person wants the VERY best for their kid. Think of the huge social pressure for parents to make the best kid they can, give them the best start in life. People WILL get frowned upon and will feel like bad parents if children have traits that they neednt have had for a few years extra debt; think of the huge guilt they will feel at any advantage they cant afford to give the child they adore.<br>
<br>
Think of the huge pressure and expectations on the kid when they are told their parents spent $XXX,XXX creating them. I remember my dad telling me I damn well better get a good job after the money he spent on my schooling, and he meant it; now multiply that ten-fold. I can see a lot of hugely rebelious kids and split families over the pressure of debt and expectation.<br>
<br>
And as for the possibility of a dad or mom cloning themselves in order to make a 'mini-me', I can see huge psychological problems there for both parent and child, in terms of false expectations for both of them.<br>
<br>
Allow research to eliminate genetic based diseases sure, clone cells for the purposes of creating organs sure, but I think genetics to improve intelligence/prowess etc could create more social problems than it cures. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxisrene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xisrene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/02 6:22:54 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://xisrene.freewebspace.com/images/xisrenep.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OT:  Cloning</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

The specific application will make more of a difference to me.  <br>
<br>
BUT expect troubles ... when humans tinker (pardon to all gnomes present) with a complex system about which they have only the most fundamental knowledge ... there will inevitably be many unforeseen consequences.<br>
<br>
At a mimimum, I would expect the following eventually --<br>
<br>
1. new diseases and disorders until we discover that one of the genes governing eye color also influences certain immunities.<br>
<br>
2. fetal/infant deaths directly attributable to the tampering (offset somewhat by infants saved from certain death by the same tampering)<br>
<br>
3. Psychological shifts in society as man becomes increasing viewed as its own creator.  If the science ever became sophisticated enough, selecting options for your child as you would for your new car could have a significant impact on the whole experience.  I recently experienced the birth of my son and even in this modern age of medicine there survives an element of mystery that I appreciate.<br>
<br>
4.  As a pure layman, I take notice of the fact that as a percentage, the DNA of most life forms on this planet vary only a little.  However, the 2% of differences between a human and a dolphin (completely made-up percentage) seems to have a large impact on the outcome.  Thus, I would expect that after making a few modifications to some DNA -- every now and then -- you would end up with the birth of a life form that cannot properly be categorized as human.<br>
 <br>
In this sense, over time you'd expect that the human race as it exists today would be supplanted by minor &quot;improvements&quot;.  It seems that a species that engages in genetically altering itself will over time (perhaps a very long time) guarantee its own extinction.  I have not yet developed an opinion as to whether a successor species that improves (in some objective sense relative to its environment) upon humanity is a desirable thing.<br>
<br>
Please forgive any scientific inaccuracies, I'm merely attempting to parse through the general information I've acquired and form an opinion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Cloning - specific organs, yes, people no<br>

Genetic engineering - yes with limits.<br>
<br>
limits being that you would have to limit things like hair color/eye color/skin tone/personality as well as place limits such as &quot;IQ (haha) cannot be raised above 100&quot; (yes I realize that IQ score is pretty much a joke, its an example). I would assume that there would have to be a limit to how smart you could make people how fast before there was any problem.<br>
<br>
Also, if you are genetically altered before birth (which is what you're aiming at) then your children will also benefit, so Gattaca is unlikely unless we go from minimal engineering to 100% engineering in a couple generations.  The only flaws you would have to worry about would be genetic mutations and latent ones (trisomy 21).  <br>

Initially, Xisrene, it will only be the rich that can afford genetic manipulation of their offspring, just as not everyone could buy a car when they were first introduced.  But eventually the price will come down and there is the potential for genetic manipulation to be as affordable as cars are today.  Not everyone can afford them, but many can.

Assuming that a person isn't genetically modified against his or her will, then isn't it the responsibility of the person who is modified to accept any potential risks?  In the case of altering embryos, then the responsibility would lie with the parents of that child.  If the parent felt that the risk of an adverse complication was too great in relation to potential benefits, then he or she probably wouldn't have the genetic alterations.<br>
<br>
There is also the theory that there might be some peculiar link between, say, eye color and resistance to cancer.  This is a rigged example and not a good way to support any intuitions about genetic manipulation.  Of course no one would change a person's eye color if it would lead to increased cancer risk.  There is a definite risk of unforseen consequences in this kind of science.  There will be tragic mistakes made, as there are throughout the history of medicine.  But there's no reason to believe that changes to eye color, or any other change, will necessarily lead to some unforseen and negative event.  So to use that type of argument adds little strength to a person's p<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uluviahoodyhooo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luvia Hoodyhooo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/02 9:09:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> As was already stated above, the simple fact is that most genetic engineering will be cosmetic.  Why, you may ask?  Because people are shallow.  Oh yeah, maybe 5 percent of the people would actually want their kid to be smarter or faster or stronger.   But for the most part, the people that can afford the genetic engineering are going to want pretty babies.<br>
<br>
I'm pro genetic engineering for the simple fact that you can remove problems (diseases, baldness, hairy back etc...) that might cause the child trauma later in life.<br>
<br>
By the way, to the person that said you can't clone Hitler or Stalin.  I don't know a ton of info about cloning, but assuming you have enough genetic information, why not?  Or did you man that you CAN clone them, but that they wouldn't be the same person personality-wise?  The second one I can understand.<br>
<br>
This actually brings up another thing I've thought about often in terms of cloning.  How long would it be before someone with money loses their 14 year old child in a car wreck, and wants to have that child cloned?  I'm not so sure I'm for cloning in that case, because the parent would expect the clone to grow up into the exact (personality-wise again) child that he/she lost.  And that's not going to be the case most likely.  I can definitely see something like that putting a major psychological trauma on the clone.<br>

Yes, as long as we clone Tolkien, too<br>

Why the hell would someone want to clone a baby when there are legions of them up for adoption? It's just wrong.<br>

It's already here in crude form.<br>

If America is not involved some other country WILL take the lead.<br>

Do we want some other country to dominate the market for enhanced human beings?<br>
<br>
This is a big deal. This can change the world much more than 911.<br>
<br>
Is GOING to. Cannot be stopped.<br>
<br>
We just need to decide whether we want to see america eclipsed by a more vibrant culture or not. If we want to have some degree of control, or try to ban it forcing it to go elsewhere and be totally beyond our control.<br>
<br>
&quot;We can't allow that to happen. It's unnatural. And that is exactly why I'm so strongly opposed to the idea of designer babies.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Cancer is natural. Death is natural. Envy, jealousy, greed are natural, and are among the first social interactions children have.<br>
<br>
Fear of the unknown is natural.<br>
<br>
But this unknown is coming, like it or not. If America lets their fear of the unknown cripple them, the new, smarter, beautiful, healthy humans which ARE coming will NOT be americans.<br>
<br>
Then what will you do? Support genocide? Wipe out say Belize because it is a haven for geneered humans? And even if you were that evil, it would not make a whit of difference. The rich ARE going to have their superior children. It'll just move elsewhere because the market CANNOT be stopped.<br>
<br>
And any attempt at interdiction will merely drive up the price so that ONLY THE RICH WILL HAVE SUPERIOR BABIES. The gap between the haves and have nots will have widened beyond recovery. Social Darwinism will have become GENETIC REALITY. The rich will actually BE BETTER.<br>
<br>
If we can calmly look at this and take the bull by the horns and say for example ok, encouraging intellectual growth is ok but enhancing aggression is not, based on logical and ethical and not based on fear we can get through this.<br>
<br>
Look down the tunnel see that light? That's a Mac Truck coming. You can get in front of it or you can get on board and try to steer it some.<br>

If not the FDA itself, then some government organization will be responsible for ensuring a minimum level of health risks. Look how long it takes to get drugs approved for use in this country.

&quot;Creating&quot; a race of superpeople does not follow evolutionary principles, and it does not follow creationist principles, so neither Darwin nor God is happy with this. You'll need a new set of principles (or nonprinciples) if you seek to implement designing individuals.<br>

There IS something wrong with increasing every attribute of the cloned individual to godlike status.
