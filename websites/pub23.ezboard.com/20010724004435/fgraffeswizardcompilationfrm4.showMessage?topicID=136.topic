Somehow, this has gotten a reputation in some peoples mind of another guild on my server, called Random Acts...<br>
<br>
   I am sitting in Greater Faydark, meditating and fooling around, when I get a tell asking me, &quot;R U the leader of the Crimson Scholars?&quot;<br>
 <br>
   Naturally, I assume this is about joining, so I say &quot;Indded I am. Please don't use those abbreviations. What can I do for you?&quot; (This is also a roleplaying restrction he would need to follow if he joined.)<br>
<br>
    Him:&quot;Do u have a robe u can sell me plz?&quot;<br>
<br>
    Me: &quot;No I don't. Please spell out &quot;you&quot; and &quot;please&quot;.&quot;<br>
   <br>
    Him: &quot;geez, it's people like u who ruin the game.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    I don't see how. I'm not obligated to sell him a robe even if I had one.  The guild isn't about twinking or giving out equipment (at least among the higher level people in the guild it's not. We're not an uber guild either.) He came to ask me to sell him a robe I might have had, and when asked to use language that didn't irritate me, he has the nerve to say I'm ruining the game.  <br>
<br>
   Well, that's exactly the kind of the thing that ruins the game for me. Not everyone is a fast typist, but it doesn't take you much longer to type out &quot;you&quot; or &quot;are&quot; then to use the abbreviations.  I may still not help you, but I'm less inclined to if you're determined to show your stupidity to me.  Especially if you have been asked twice to stop...<br>
<br>
   This refers to only those who speak English as their first language, often foreign players learn these abbreviations from the lazy typists.<br>

I generally think that people who talk like that have the average intelligence of a crossbreed snail and orc. However, people grow accustomed to it, and some my my best friends irl who play everquest talk like that. It's just plain arrogant to demand that someone talks a certain way. If they're in your guild, yeah sure you have every right to make the rules, but don't force it upon people with your own assumptions. Ah well, there's not really a point to arguing this, it just irked me a bit.<br>

I often give away twinkets(tm) to players that could truly use them (i.e. elemental binders are great for that lvl 3 mage still whacking bats in front of Felwithe), but when I get hit with &quot;do you have anything a nub can use?&quot; I give them something that they can really use, advice. &quot;Something that you can use each and every day is manners, use them daily and you will be greatly rewarded in game, this is my gift for you&quot; For some, they get it, for others they go on ignore and I tend to not see them again. I am not the fastest lvler around, so I get to see alot of progress from younger wizards, most that I helped can now help me if I call on them, and that is the true power of this game, building friendships. <p>Full Mana,<BR>

It is not a composition. It is a way of communicating, and if you don't understand what is said, then ask again. This is more a chat based system. I don't feel like typing out though when you get the picture when I say tho. It is phonetic and faster.<br>

and I would have to say I have never met a person in game who had a problem with it<br>

When the battle spam is hitting my screen at high speed, I need both eyes on the screen<br>
so as to not miss anything, if using a few abreviations accomplishes this----then for all you<br>

Geez.. as long as u can understand it's good enough.  So let me see are you prejudice?? Just because people do not type properly you ignore them? I find that kinda mean.  Not everyone who play EQ speak english as their first language.  So in a real life sitiuation if someone walk up to you and ask you for direction but do not speak probably and you still understand you just gonna ignore them? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulenadaynastardew.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenadayna Stardew</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/01 10:58:49 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=c:\windows\desktop\lena.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: &quot;It's people like me who ruin the game&quot;</span><hr size=1>   You're missing the point.

   No, it is not &quot;good enough&quot; as long as you can understand it. I have to understand it, too.  If you think this always happens with such sentences, you need to think again.   It's a matter of courtesy and respect, which this person, since he was essentially begging for an item could have used.  (Please note neither respect nor courtesy are one of my strong suits, but this is one point I am consistent on). Yes, it does lower my opinion of your intelligence unless I've known you in-game or you're risen above me having that idea about you.     <br>
<br>
   Unless I'm mocking someone, which I've only done one time, I will say nothing about this in ooc, gsay or shouts, but I'm afraid tells are as close to &quot;personal space&quot; as something can be in Everquest.<br>
As for my guild channel, the rules of the guild prohibit it, and the offenders just get warned about it.  Most members are good about avoiding it.<br>
<br>
   People who didn't speak English as their first language were also specifically included from this, but at least they'll have the courtesy to tell you that English is not their first language.  Telling that they might not speak your langauage as a native speaker ins't hard either.<br>
<br>
<br>
    I'm also not an English teacher.  Anyone who wanted to comb through these posts could find run-on sentences, typographical errors and missing words.  This is one of my biggest writing problems, but I do make the effort to avoid them.   Have I been published in the past? Yes.  Do I hope to again? Yes.  Have I been paid yet? No.  (Yes, what I write is more heavily edited than ramblings on message boards.)<br>
<br>
     That should give a hint of the standing of my skills.<br>

<br>
I used to play with two friends of mine, they were father and daughter respectively and they were both very good players. However, if I ever needed to speak to the father, the daughter would literally have to get on the phone with her dad and have her tell me what he wanted to say. Some people are just *that bad* at typing and merely play EQ for the game, not a chat room. The few times I did get him to talk on his own accord he the sentences were very brief, often mispelled, and sometimes abbreviated. <br>
<br>
Understand that not everyone is as skilled a typer as you or I and that (although I don't agree) they're in your &quot;personal space&quot;, they don't realize they're in err. IMO, they're not. <br>
<br>
Ah well, just some words to ponder..<br>
