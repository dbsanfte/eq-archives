As of up to date, the only thing that the Research skill was used with was making of new spells. (Either by words, runes, or pages) This is common sense to a person using research. But after a point, the research skill disappears, never to be used again. This occurs with a person obtaining all of their 49 level spells. Some even stop it earlier because of the fact that other higher level characters in their own Guild can make them for him/her. Research should be a very highly used skill for a spellcaster and it should always be used to advance the skills of the caster even further. We can throw in more higher level spells that can be made via research, but this doesn't help the problem, since people are gonna use the same techniques of gaining the spells as beforehand. (other people who have the skill maxxed) So this is a trade skill easily tossed aside, living under the blanket of dustbunnies.<br>
<br>
So how do we fix this predicament. Yeah sure, the enchanters have the mastery of making enchanted jewelry to increase the potential of the stats of the wearer.  And the magicians have the abilities to summon items of power that were only bound onto the world of Norrath until the player expired of fatigue and left the world. But what about research? out of the game concept, the masters of wizardry, who spent their times learning and research the knowledge of Magic itself, was able to channel their focused energies and abilities into items of power.<br>
<br>
Research can be used to implement this. Given a new spell, channel item (wiz, mag, enc, nec), this spell would be used to ready the item to be made magical. We can limit the type of item per class (Ex: Class specific items), or even expand the classes the other pure caster classes but to a lesser degree for them since their research skill will be hindered by the non-use of research spells.<br>
<br>
Ex: One of the wizzies research spells is Enstill. We take the Channel Item spell on a staff (using basic example) . The staff becomes &quot;Channeled Staff&quot;. Now take the Channeled Staff, and the 2 research runes (Neglect &amp; Oppression) &amp; combine all 3 items into the research book. If successful the item can be called Staff of Enstillment.<br>
<br>
Now how do we balance this skill out: The most common way is like all trade skills: trivial levels. Certain spells on certain items would have a trivial level. Where as the 16th level research spells would be fairly common to be trivial at in Channeling items, where as the 49th level spells will have a harder time on succeeding. Also with this new skill, we can add extra research items to incorporate more spells and higher up spells past the 49th mark. Also ways of balancing out is use of charges on the items. You may say CHARGES, HOW DARE YOU!!!, but alas lemme explain this.<br>
<br>
Let's go with the example we used. Staff of Enstillment. If we use the basic staff found in the newbie area, or maybe a special staff that dropped with similar commonality. The use of Research to make the item would be say 5 charges. Now we take the same spell but channel maybe the equivalent of a bronze staff, it may have 10 charges instead of 5, but it is on a higher scale of difficulty to make and maybe have a longer duration on the spell. No if we take this same idea with maybe a very higher staff (velium for example) the charges can be brought up to 20.<br>
But if we use the charges idea, why would people pay for these items. There has to be some leeway with this. Would the item be useless after the charges go away. Maybe or maybe not. People use 10 charge sow potions, and keep coming back for more. But why, because the usefulness of sow is always needed. People may not like the idea of charges with enstill or other type of spells, but give a warrior trying to solo. Enstill may be something good for the user, kind of something that can be used to get away with easy.<br>
<br>
Another way people can using this skill is combining sets of runes to make double effecting or triple effecting items. The research book may need to be expanded to maybe 6 or 8 slots for this, but may be well worth it. give the same example. use boots instead of a staff. Channel the boots and combine in the research book Attraction &amp; Expulsion (Levitate), Neglect &amp; Oppression (Enstill) and the Channeled Boots. The resulting item would be Boots of airy grasp. The research skill on this item would be harsh, but add a perma effect of lev with 10 charges of enstill.<br>
<br>
Lastly on this, items that can be used other than runes that can increase durations,distances and other manipulations. Why do this? because common sense. In old tales of myth, the practicioners of magic used items like pentagrams, hearts of fell beasts, and other items of the like to increase the powerfulness of the items in which they were creating. They were considered as &quot;focus items&quot;. Means of channeling items into a more devastating power source. Items like these in combination of runes and the channeled items, produce more powerful effects.<br>
<br>
Just promise to read this and take it into concept. Remember this is Just an idea<br>

<br>
You could combine certain spells at certain levels, and get Held items that would add stats and whatnot.<br>
<br>
For instance:<br>
<br>
To make a basic Book, you'd combine your level 16 researched spells into a &quot;Apprentice Manual&quot;. Then combine your level 20 spells into a &quot;Advanced manual&quot;. Combine the two and you'd get a Book with stats that you could use/sell. The books you create would be used in the recipes of the more advanced books (like the Velious Quests), and should be class based (I.E. Wizards could only make Books for Wizzies, Necros would only make books for Necros).<br>
<br>
The idea behind making them class based is so you couldn't make too much of a profit on them. In fact, they could even be no-drop (yah yah, I know...).<br>
<br>
I agree research should be more of a class tradeskill like Alchemy. I just wish VI saw it that way. <p><center><br>Jarnin Fisheermann<Br><b>Disciple of Hate<Br><b>Rallos Zek</b><Br></b><Br>Grand Master Fisherman<Br>Master Brewer<Br>Master Chef<Br>Master of Begging</center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umdarkelf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mdar kelf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/24/01 11:54:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=503.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suggestive ideas on research skill</span><hr size=1> this would be great to have!!<br>
<br>
and as a side note, so that a lvl one cant have a lvl 60 wizard make all of this stuff, and twink, make it so that the item would work for some one of the same lvl, IE lvl 20 enstill stick<br>
would only work for those lvl 20+<br>
and since there are no runes for 12 and below spells they dont get items.<br>
<br>
Also, would be cool if we could make procing items, any one want a cracked staff of rooting? just take Rune X spell:root cracked staff and maybe a gem of some kind (the better the item, the better the gem) would be nice to make a FS weapon for a warrior with our lvl 20 stun on it.. <br>
<br>
and make it work on MAGIC items as well, like enchant some non-no drop items and give them some decent proc's...<br>
or make us some really nice no drop stuff (FS staff Effect:clarity any one?)<br>
<br>
