      I agree.  I guess its my fault for not being clear.  What I was referring to was this attempt (That is always made by both sides) to claim that history gives that party the only claim to Palestine.  This is usually done by selective quot9ing of history.  The truth is, both sides have historical connections to Palestine and national identify formed at roughly the same time for both the Israelis and the Palestinians.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Are you aware that attitude in Palestine is a recent thing?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
     Really?  Was it new when the Arabs went on a Pogrom killing Jews in 1920?  Was it new in 1948 when the Palestinians rejected the mandate and tried to destroy Israel?  Was it new when the Arabs tried to destroy Israel in 1967 or 1973?  I don’t know if we have the polling data to support or refute this, but it seems to me that the Palestinians have wanted to destroy Israel for a damn long time.  <br>

<br>
     Murdering civilians is “Fighting back?”  Perhaps, if they used the negotiating table rather than terror, they would have their own state already?  There is no need to “fight back” for what can be won through peaceful means.  They have been repeatedly been offered a state and have instead <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> chosen</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> violence and terror.  They choose to fight, not Israel.

<br>
     How typical.  Once again, the Palestinians allege that Israelis are intentionally killing Palestinians civilians.  There is ZERO such evidence that Israel intentionally killed anyone.  Sadly, the Palestinian terrorists hide amongst civilians who get caught in the crossfire.  I am reminded of the Palestinian lies about a massacre at Jenin.  The world jumped on Israel, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.honestreporting.com/Critiques/2002/35_jenin3.asp">the biased media reported the non-existent atrocity with no evidence only to find out that the Palestinians made it all up.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  The Palestinians murder innocent Israeli civilians every day, all you can do is make up allegations about Israel doing the same.  Most people know this is nonsense, yet we are still saddened that the Palestinian terrorists put Palestinian civilians in the line of fire. <br>
<br>
     Of course, maybe its not enough to just indicate that 19 innocent Israelis were murdered on Tuesday, 7 on Wednesday and <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.jpost.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=JPost/A/JPArticle/Full&amp;cid=1023716528177">four more today, including a mother and her three children.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  Real people are being murdered: <br>

But you know what, let's say you were totally right: What then? Exactly what are they going to accomplish. &quot;Survival as a nation&quot; isn't a game plan.

     In 2000, the Israelis agreed to give the Palestinains a de-facto state with 96% of the West Bank and Gaza.  This took an amazing amount of compromise by Israel.  The Palestinians would not budge and walked away from the table because they did not get everything that they wanted.  There is onoy one side that won't compromise, the Palestinians.  The only thing that Israel won't compromise on is its right to exist, and since the Palestinains want to destroy Israel, that is why there will be no peace. <p>Torcer Arcana - 60 Sorcerer - Brothers of Darkness - The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/20/02 4:23:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1215.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-side-01.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alan Keyes's tirade. . .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> only thing that Israel won't compromise on is its right to exist, and since the Palestinains want to destroy Israel, that is why there will be no peace.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->OK, so what happens next?<br>

<br>
While it is technically true that the bulk of the Founding Fathers were deists (Thomas Jefferson wrote a Bible he liked, which basically took all the miracles out of it and turned it into a gutless tract for a quasi-buddhist religion) that doesn't negate the fact that their Deism and world view was based on ... Judeo Christian principles.<br>

<br>
I've done this before in another thread, so i'll give the short version (w/o details) here:<br>
<br>
     Israel must separate itself from the Palestinians.  The &quot;fence&quot; is a sad statement, but a necessary precaution.  These people can't live together so lets accept that.  Suicide Bombers are not &quot;lone gunmen,&quot; they are educated, supported and equipted by a network.  The terrorist networks should be crushed with overwhelming military might.  Any re-emergence should be met with immediate, swift and effective action by the IDF.  <br>
<br>
      Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the PFLP do not exist, but for the sufferance of the government.  The Palestinian Authority (&quot;PA&quot;) has allowed these terror groups to operate and thrive in the PA territory.  Arafat et. al. have refused to use the 40,000 armed men they control to do anything about these terror groups.  The PA must go.  The PA needs a regime change or so much reform that it would in no way resemble what it is now.  That means the current group of Arafat and cronies need to be exhiled.  A real Government, one with a true &quot;monopoly on force,&quot; must be put in place in the interem. <br>
<br>
The end-goal is a democratic Palestinain state.  Once the territory is truley &quot;controlled,&quot; and terror groups marginalized, then there can be a Marshall Plan for the Palestinians.  education, social programs, infrastructure and democracy.  However, all of this presupposes that the terror groups are marginalized.  That can't happen until the PA goes away and the Arabs REALLY recognize Israel's right to exist.<br>
 (And yes, the settlers must leave the West Bank too, but only once the terror has stoppsed)  <p>Torcer Arcana - 60 Sorcerer - Brothers of Darkness - The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uclaudshadowflare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ClaudShadowflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/20/02 5:29:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1215.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alan Keyes's tirade. . .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> (And yes, the settlers must leave the West Bank too, but only once the terror has stoppsed)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So you're saying that Israel shouldn't budge until the Palestinians budge?<br>
<br>
Palestine does not have an army that could come close to fighting the Israeli army.  Their only means of effective fighting is by throwing bodies at the Israelis.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Israeli invades cities everyday; often innocent Palestinian civilians are killed.  This gives Palestinians an excuse to attack Israel.  Israel's government and military have yet to apologize for the killings of innocents, and try to block investigations of spots at which wartime atrocities may have been committed, like Jenin.<br>
<br>
Neither side is in the right here.  And I think it will take many more months of bloodshed before either side realizes that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Gnomus Originalus</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/20/02 5:31:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1215.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/whiz-side-01.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alan Keyes's tirade. . .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the PFLP do not exist, but for the sufferance of the government.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->For the record, Islamic Jihad and Hamas are both multinational terrorist organizations.

<br>
Great question.  I wish I had an answer.  I just think that we are very gullible if we think that there HAS to be a viable solution.  Sometimes, there is no good answer.  I think the same thing is true here.<br>
<br>
When people hate as much as these groups do, the only victory is in total conquering of one side by the other.  That cannot happen here because a) the world politic will hold Israel back, expecting its people to accept terror we would never put up with, and b) if Israel gets close to totally conquerring the area, it will cause a major regional conflict they cannot win without horrendous consequences, which is why a) is the case.  If things get bad, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and other nations will jump into the fray to keep that from happening.<br>
<br>
End game?  Ever see the end of War Games?  Sometimes the only reasonable move is not to play. <p><font face=impact>
