We all know that we suck on the sustained damage front.  Didn't really need to be opening up old wounds that were temporarily forgotten about from hearing the praise in the original post.

Sorry but the only people who can afford to have elitist attitudes are warriors, clerics, and enchanters.  The &quot;other side of the coin&quot; you were trying to enlighten us all with is what I hear in nearly every in-game conversation about wizards, on a lot of message boards, in a lot of posts on THIS board even.<br>
<br>
You're a monk, right?  Just how efficient are monks in a group?  Pulling they do pretty good, BUT a Grave Lord can feign and get back up 3 times before your FD timer resets... not to mention has spells to assist in pulling (darkness and fear are very fun to use while splitting).  Ah, but SKs require mana to Feign... that's ok since &quot;efficient&quot; groups always have an enchanter on hand with C2, and even though a SK's melee output is significantly lower than a monks he'll be too busy pulling nonstop to engage a mob anyway.  If you have an enchanter to mez then a warrior can just pull whatever he wants.  Monks do melee damage right?  But wouldn't a rogue fill up your slot and do quite a bit more damage?<br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
They way you talk about efficiency, I'm sure you don't play a nuker or hybrid class... they are sometimes very inefficient in powergaming, as any of them will tell you (I play both).<br>
<br>
Back to the original post... if SullahD was a hardcore powergamer, he would have NEVER posted his comments here.  His intention was to show that even though powergamers like yourself, Heich, have totally given up on wizards for exp groups that not everyone has...<br>
<br>
I just love it when people tell me that the reason I can't find a group is because I chose to start a nuker, so thanks.  Thanks for enlightening me about the way things work.  Thanks for ruining the only truly positive thread I've read all night while my server was down.  In conclusion, I'd just like to say **** you.

First of all, a few of my real-life friends play wizards in my guild, and I've helped each one with their epic weapon quests by camping VS, going to Kedge over and over and over again for that dreaded staff, and I group regularly with wizards in my guild or in pickup groups; I've played with the best and the worst wizards, yet I don't have to generalize and put down any class with comments like <br>

Err, Wizards can snare just fine. In fact they are usually more on top of things than a druid since they have fewer responsibilities.  <br>
<br>
to say it's fun to group with wizards for AE parties in Chardok or to clear Fear or to do any xp group. And Sullah, you didn't have to directly say that wizards were better or not; your post implied subtly that in your experience they were although that was your personal observation that you deemed necessary to post in the first place when talking about wizards. We can all make pro-wizards comments here without generalizing about other classes, and as for others saying &quot;F*ck you,&quot; that's pretty rude -- despite what you think, we're not trolling but were participating in a discussion in which I agreed that wizards are fun to group with and I had no problem with the class or any class. <br>

Miss Foxfyre -- Sullah is obviously experienced, at least IMO.  He plays a cle and a dru, both past level 50.  I'm guessing he's been grouped with plenty of both wizards and druids in his lifetime.  If his experiences are &quot;limited&quot; in your eyes, so be it, that limitation is based on YOUR experiences and what you've heard from folks you know.  That is also based on your interpretation of what he said, which is probably more general than what he meant.  He said &quot;too many,&quot; not all, but that is a general phrase.  It's all relative.  =)  Don't call someone small minded, just correct them if you feel they are in the wrong, and understand that we are not all laywers or english professors. =)<br>
<br>
Someone help me take my own advice.<br>
<br>
&quot;You came here to make a post that was preaching to the choir, and of course, you got your expected cheers for making pro-wizard statements on a wizard discussion forum.&quot;<br>
<br>
Fox, you see this as kissing up, or so that's how I interpret this last statement.  I, as well as others here, see this as a reassuring pat on the back.  When a friend is down, it's only natural to comfort him.  Thanks for making it look like a big brown-nosing contest. =(   I think that's why people might be calling you a troll, if in fact they're referring to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Heich -- You're obviously a nice guy, IMO.  That's clear from your first post.  I think what Sullah and many of us are saying is that powergamers seem to be in the vast majority these days, causing groups to not take wizards.  While nothing says that you are required to take a wizzie, when you don't, you disallow the wiz group fun.  Ultimately it's Verant's fault, but unfortunately they haven't fixed it yet.  It's actually gotten worse from what I've seen.<br>
    This is a large grey area.  Play for yourself?  Or give a little so someone else can have fun?  Personally, I think it's only human to help out the little guy.  This concept applies to many things.  It's being nice when you don't have to.  But that's me.<br>
     However, the choice is ultimately yours.<br>
<br>
&quot;Regarding having &quot;fun,&quot; I'm getting very sick of people who don't realize that there are actually people in the world that have fun by competing and being the best of the best.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just reiterating: fun for all, not fun for the Holy Trinity and their supporters. =P  When people say, &quot;come on, have some fun, play with a wiz,&quot; many are say that you should chill out, and let the entire group have a good time.  See previous paragraph.  That point of view comes from folks like wizzies and necros and mages. Not monks.  =)<br>
<br>
<br>
I figure that most folks calling you a troll, Heich, are saying so because you came back very defensively in your &quot;what is fun for you isn't for me&quot; post.  Go read it over pretending to be a wiz, it's brash.  Not that Sullah's wasn't, but yours isn't subtle about it.  Heich, your &quot;some people like exp groups&quot; argument is fine and dandy, but on a fundamental level contradicts Sullah's post, thus why people claim you de-railed it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Folks, in general, just go read this thread over a few times.  Try to put yourself in the other person's shoes, and I think you'll read things as much less offensive.  Heich pissed me off the first time I read his post, but I went back and read it all together and in context, and everyone seems to be handling this well.  My only complaint is that the topic did get soured, not only by making it look like a brown-nosing contest, but de-railing the whole argument together saying, in effect, &quot;deal with it, we like xp grind groups.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
That's a long pole.<br>

 As a 60 cleric I use my wizard in exp groups as a traffic meter.  If this certain mob is dealing enough damage that I am loosing more mana than is healthy ..I'll burn it down fast.  But if I know this other mob is dealing less damage and I am actually gaining mana ..I might not nuke so that my clerical self can get more mana.<br>
 I think for those of us that play two characters at once (there *is* a time and place ..boring exp grind in Velks-yes ..main cleric in Temple of Veeshan-no) that a cleric/wizard combo is GREAT!  I can play either from one computer (yay hotkeys) since I can watch hit points of group members and the mob at the same time.  <br>
 I am not afraid to let my wizard die if we don't need an evaccer; I won't let my group suffer because I play two at once(I think that has  happened once maybe twice tops).  But, my wizard has never suffered an unressed death so I can afford the 4% I dont get back from res.<br>

Indeed, it is you who are mistaken.  Unless your group is fine already(in which case you should not be adding more members regardless) The act of passing over a good wizard in order to wait for a different class is horribly innefecient and shortsighted.  <br>
<br>
Also, If you are in a crowded zone like velkators, you may get some stretches with nothing to pull.  Your amount of time spent in combat can easily slide down to about 30%, at which point a wizard will be much more valuable for damage than another melee.<br>
<br>
Wizards actually seem to compare quite well against melees before level 55.  Except for rogues, many of whom have their epics by 52, a wizard is competitive with moderately equipped warriors and monks for pure damage, and an equal amount of nuke damage can be much more valuable than melee damage.  Nothing is forcing the wizard to distribute his damage evenly over every mob, the only real limitation is aggro and mana.  On multiple pulls where crowd control is not possible, a wizard can easily cut your damage taken by 30% to 40% by nuking at first rather than evenly over two mobs.  When crowd control is possible, nukes aren't quite so dramatically useful, but they will still lighten the load on the crowd controller.<br>
<br>
That is dependant on the skill and patience of the wizard, and the confidence of the wizard if his group is a dumb group and asks him why he is not nuking at such and such a time.  And also, as you approach 60 and as melees continue to get better and better equipment, they seem to lose their ability to compete with warriors and monks for overall damage, and rather than thinking of it as a bonus that the wizard can go full burn, a full burn wizard is only slightly better than normal melee damage output.<br>
<br>
Early 50's a wizard can probably crank his dps in a short time up to 100-150dps or so.  Show me any other class except mage that can come close to that pre-epic pre-offensive discs.  It's at level 60 when the wizard has to go full burn just to equal melee damage output that they begin to be less effecient. <br>
<br>
Wizards add flexibility as well as damage to your group.  If you only look at overall damage done you will not see the true value of a wizard.  Therefore any claims of effeciency or lackthereof based purely on dps numbers are weak.<br>
<br>
I don't mean to insult, but you don't appear to have really considered the effect nukes will have.  You go on for quite awhile about meditation and how it limits damage.. but the thing is, if wizards did not need to meditate, wizards would unquestionably the best damage dealing class in the game by a huge margin.<br>
<br>
I'm not just disagreeing with you on the basis that people want to have fun.  Yes, players want to excel and that is what is fun for them.  But while one group operates at sub optimal effeciency while waiting for what they percieve to be a suitably effecient class, the practical group next door is outkilling/outxping them because they accepted the &quot;ineffecient&quot; wizard.  Sure, when the first group gets their perfect class, they'll have a short burst of optimal xp(at least, it will feel optimal to them) until one of their critical members leaves.  Chances are that they won't match the smart group that took the best of what was available rather than waiting on a better class.<br>

I was very upset last night, but maybe I'm the only one who hates when a positive thread gets derailed so bad by a few lurkers.  As for picking apart the final portion of my rant post... of course it was immature and rude.

Even the versatility of rangers can pretty much nullify the use of monks in general. Infact even a superbly equiped warrior can deal as much damage as a monk with no problems -- and they can tank. Efficiency has absolutely nothing to do with pulling. It's the killing speed that matters and shadowknights lack in that department but thanks for &quot;derailing&quot; my post! <br>
<br>
What was your point by the way? That monks aren't the greatest efficient class either? I realize that, but I highly doubt shadowknights can kill more efficiently.<br>
<br>
2) I've already explained the differences between efficiency of melee classes and casters, scroll up.<br>
<br>
3) This entire topic was based around Sullah downgrading other people to uplift wizards. Forgive me for standing up in defense for people who group rogues over wizards, if that makes me a troll then so be it.<br>
<br>
I played a 50 wizard pre-kunark on Tarew Marr, also played a 55 paladin post kunark, and eventually now I play a 60 monk and a 55 druid. None of these classes are greatly efficient. But thanks for stereotyping me as an &quot;elitist&quot; and a &quot;power gamer.&quot;<br>
<br>
I took offense to Sullah's stereotypical comments about druids and rogues. If you want to start a thread to uplift wizards that's fine, but don't do it by bashing other classes.<br>
<br>
I put in my original post debating Sullah's points (which you guys have apparently heard already, thanks for repeating that over and over) and suddenly boom, I'm a troll, and have this wonderful Velnariel guy with a superiority complex telling me &quot;F*ck you&quot; simply because I said wizards don't get grouped as fast as other classes because they're innefficient.<br>
<br>
Great thanks!<br>
<br>
In the future I'll remember to sit down in silence when people insult my classes, in fear of becoming a &quot;thread derailer&quot; and a &quot;troll.&quot; <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uheich.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Heich</A> at: 12/15/01 11:55:23 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utehutibloodstorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tehuti Bloodstorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/15/01 12:00:11 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.toddalan.com/~berglund/ikp_hao.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Group a Wizard for Crying out Loud (Cleric's perspective</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 3) This entire topic was based around Sullah downgrading other people to uplift wizards.

Although it seemed to go unappreciated last night) what Sullah was trying to say should have been interpreted as this:  <br>
<br>
Druids have so much to do watching hp as a back up healer, keeping track of buffs, sow requests, DoT's nukes, more buffs (which take a lot of mana by the way), and the possibility of evacs too that Sure! A snare might be missed here or there. They constantly have to switch spells in and out having so much to keep track of.  Wizards don't have all the buffing and possible healing to watch out for, or DoTs either.<br>
<br>
As for Rogues, and Wizards tending to be more literate and funny, doesn't mean to say Rogues are illiterate.  If that's your main discussion you should admit to taking a defensive stance on the entire topic instead of reading it for what it is.  Sullah didn't mean to insult all rogues saying that they aren't as TALKATIVE and funny, rather that the main composition of the rogue class is powergaming, to do that big end-game damage.  It's the easiest mindset of the class, wizards tend to have silly, goofy personalities because that is what is easiest to fall back to for us. Don't get me wrong, I know rogues that always put a smile on my face. But Wizards spend so much time in a battle not doing anything but meding and tend to say more stuff.<br>
