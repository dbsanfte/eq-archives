But here is what I think.<br>
<br>
If wizards are supposed to be the best at handing out damage, like warriors are for melee, why not give them more mana like warriors get the most hp? Makes sense that if you can cast more spells, you can put out more damage. Also, why not upgrade the damage on the spells 50+? I remember playing before RoK came out and was extremely happy to see myself getting a 1000+ damage spell. When I returned to the game, I get spells that do 640+ damage. Now, Im thinking, they say that these spells are not as resistable as those spells are. But, I see the same resistances as I did before RoK came out. I do not see any difference. Ice comet does 1120 damage while costing 400 mana. Drought of Fire does 648 damage while costing 215 mana. It takes me two castings of DoF to do 1298 damage while costing me 430 mana. Id rather just cast Ice Comet on the mob to save me time from casting 2 spells and getting the agro of casting it twice on him in a row. Raise the damage on the 50+ spells. It's just not fun anymore to see myself do such low damage to a mob.<br>
<br>
Another topic is the Epic. I really do not like the spell that is associated with our Epic. Why not give us a spell that does DD instead of a damage shield? Its supposed to be our EPIC. I dont want a stupid DS. I can just cast that on myself. I have no cares about buying Peridots. I wish they would change it to be a right clickable dd spell, maybe some spell that does 900-1200 damage. <br>
<br>
Those are my thoughts on wizards right now.<br>

I have suggested this before in my posts. If we are the warriors of the caster class then why shouldn't we have more manna then other casters? Same as warriors have more HPs then other melee classes right? I would much rather stay in the fight longer then be pacified with some lame spells at lvl 60 that are only able to hit a certain type of mob. What do we do before lvl 60? Stay un-useful? Our RoK spells should not have had less damage considering the HP's of the mobs we were encountering, with Velious it's even worse. <br>
<br>
I am out damaged by groups of warriors everyday. This has now become a melee class game. Wizards don't do much more damage then any other caster class in this game. I was the only wizard on a Trak raid last week and I went LD before the fight, Trak died and they didn't even miss me. Sad day when I see we are not even missed on fights anymore : ( <p>Deanara Darklager <BR>

If the mana pool were to be increased, the mana regen rate would have to be increased accordingly.  I think better efficiency would work best.  Here's a question for anyone who cares, I don't play any melee classes so I don't know, but are they soft-capped on their Strength, Stamina, etc. stats like casters are with Intelligence?<br>

<br>
This would go some way to satisfy &quot;a Thirst for Knowledge&quot; we all supposedly Posess...<br>
<br>
Main opposition to this would be Soloing potential and also the Unhingement of the Economics in the Game, as suddenly GEB's and other similar Items will become Wanted items again.... Intellince will become a high price commodity....<br>
<br>
Solutions? I would say that the regen shouldnt be activated until 50+ and should only be activated in stages... say 50-53: 220 cap .... 54-56: 240 cap ... 57-58: 260 cap ... 59: 280 cap ... 60: 300 cap<br>
Also, the Additional mana could be tied in with this, so U get more mana when U hit the new cap instead of getting 1 point of mana per point after 200.<br>
<br>
I personally think this is a Good Idea, maybe one we should put to Verant themselves... Before we do that tho, I'd like to open up the rest of this thread to ways of Limiting the solo benefits that come with the increase...<br>
<br>
Oh and to answer Akailen's Question, there is a cap, but its no nearly as noticable as the Wis-Int caps... My Rogue has been known to get alsmost 300 Str.... this VASTLY increases his attack rating as if there was no cap, he can also carry that much more stuff (no cap) and he can BS for an INCREDIBLE amount... But his normal damage isnt increased further (other than the fact he now hits twice as often with the better str).... Also although the ATK says ****/1000 U can actually exceed this.... I know that for a fact <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugarathta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GarathTA</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/6/01 3:09:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=254.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aggressors.com/images/Garath01.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My thoughts on Wizards</span><hr size=1> You cannot raise int above 255.  &quot;... almost 300 STR...&quot;?

<br>
I personally think all casters should have an Intelligence cap of 300 to 400 except wizards.  Why not wizards?  Because I think wizards shouldn't have a cap at all, or it should be some really insanely high amount like 800 or 1000.  If they truly are thirsty for knowledge, then they will quest for that knowledge.  As they gain more knowledge, the more intelligent they become!  The more intelligent they become, the more power they gain.  The more power they gain, the more knowledge they will seek in order to gain even MORE power.<br>

Thanks for the stat info.<br>

<br>
To Akailen: hehehe I ran the Caster's Realm mana calc with a figure for IQ of 999 (wouldnt let me put 1000 in) the mana my Wiz would have at this is 11906 /grin<br>
26 Full Casts of Sunstrike for 41600 damage and if mana regen was increased to accomodate Inc (and not leave us with 1 hour Down time) I'm pretty damn sure the Wizard that Thirsted for the Most Knowledge would be UBER... And Hey, Why not is my response, The difficulty someone would have in getting that ridiculose Int should make them UBER, it'll be a HELL of alot harder than some Melee Char getting a Wep from Veeshan's Peak or Scriping and saving enough money to Kit himself out in the Finest none-no drop armour money can buy. I frankly hope for at least a Mana regen of 80-100 per tick for that Int to... /grin-more <br>
with an extra 7 maybe 8 after casting, using the newly Built up mana. /sigh we can dream...<br>
Of course the spell will never work, s'just gonna be resisted to death (wizard death of course as he dies with a Full mana bar -only 2 casts) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=254.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=254.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=254.topic&index=6><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=254.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=254.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=254.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=254.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm30">Veeshan's Peak Key<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm31">Fusibility Research<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Luclin Spell Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Luclin Faction Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Luclin Quest Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Luclin Item Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm39">MOB Resistance Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10>Class Balance & Class Bugs</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
