Thats the reason why I have come here.&quot;<br>
<br>
If you feel this way Raistin you should form a thread talking about it. Armok put an amazing amount of thought and work into this--he doesnt deserve to get a rant because you are pissed about wizzie bitching.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, you really really really should watch you generalizations. I am lvl 50, and have been very clear since day one that I have always been able to get a group. Of course unlike others, I never argued that that consequently meant the class was perfect. Nevertheless, I love my wizard and gave up a 45 shaman to play him full time. <br>
<br>
It has been said over and over again, people who think there is room for improvment in the class dont neccassarily hate the class. And people who love the class don't neccessarily think that its perfect.<br>
<br>
I am really sorry that you have had problems with people posting here. I have found Graffe's boards to be some of the most thought-provoking ones I have seen on EQ. But we don't have to agree on that. My only point is that venting that here, in this thread, is an awful idea.<br>
<br>
There is plenty of whining that goes on on this board. There is also blind optimism--people who think because something works for them it works for all wizzies. This thread is neither of those though. It didnt deserve that post, especially given that you hadn't even bothered to read the oriiginal post. <br>

Before I do that, let me say that there is one point, not so minor that I do agree with from the original post.  Mudflation, starting with Kunark and continuing to the present has definitely favored the melees.  Yes, casters have gotten some improvements, but NOTHING of the order of magnitude that the melees have received.  But to address that requires considerable adjustments to all casters, not just wizards.<br>
<br>
As to the complaint that wizards have trouble getting into exp groups, I wrote the following in response to a post whose point that was since our dps is below that of a warrior, wizards were (and apparently should be) denied entrance to a hypothetical group of 5 seeking a 6th.  Later discussions, aimed at minimizing the 'utility' of a wizard, postulated a group pulling singles in a place with no risk of adds in any form and the mobs being pulled posed no real danger to the group as a whole.<br>
<br>
To that discussion I added the following, which I feel has some relevance to Armok's original post:<br>
<br>
===========<br>
<br>
The original point of this thread was upping wizard damage per second in order to fill the 6th spot in a hypothetical single-pull, experience group.<br>
<br>
Baelzharon has pointed out that single-pull groups are a wizard's least effective exp gaining option.<br>
<br>
I want to make two points here. But both of them can be summed up as the fundamental premise(s) are wrong.<br>
<br>
First, the point is made that wizards sustained damage per second (dps hereafter), is too low. I do not contend what the actual figures are, to me they are irrelevant. I know my power and am quite satisfied with it, and for the most part have been throughout my wizardly career. I only made 60 less than 2 months ago, so I do remember the earlier part of my career quite well.<br>
<br>
But again, the dps is irrelevant. It is a convenient number to use because with logs hard numbers can be obtained and good comparisons made. Unfortunately, for the coveted 6th slot in the coveted group mentioned at the start, the real number of interest is not dps, it is blue bubbles of experience gained per hour, and possibly, amount of loot gained per hour. Dps is a tool to help measure that and a helpful one, but you should not lose sight of the real goal. It is efficient farming, whether that be of experience or loot or both. This point was brought home to me when the 'utility' that a wizard brings to a group was being cited as something that detracted from our dps. True, using root, snare, evacs, do reduce the dps of the wizard being micro-scrutinized. But those same spells increase the dps of the whole group. Most importantly, they increase the blue bubbles of exp gained per hour. And that is the thing that should be the focus here, not dps. Dps as the primary goal is really a red herring.<br>
<br>
Consider just snare. And let's assume for the moment that you do not have your epic, so you probably do not want to snare early and deliberately gain aggro at the start of the fight. Fine. Cast it later. It has an immediate effect, small, but noticeable. If your enchanter, cleric or other nuker somehow gets aggro, the pet is slower to get to them. This makes it easier for the tank to find it, follow and if not reacquire aggro, at least kill it quicker. But the real bonus is at the end of the fight. The mob goes into 'flee' mode. It can't go anywhere because its low HP have reduced its movement rate and the snare zeroes it out. Now all the melees get to hack at it, from whatever angle they want, and it does not hit back. It just stands there and dies. Not hitting the melees means less healer mana used, means more and faster pulls. Also means you can do tougher mobs since that last little bit of the mobs HP is 'free' to the group. Forget about not having to chase the mob, forget about trains, evacs and CRs. Just getting those free hits at the end adds more to the group efficiency than the wizard being able to squeeze off another nuke.<br>
<br>
&quot;Familiarity breeds contempt.&quot; It seems to me that is precisely the problem in this discussion. Some wizards are so used to snare, that they do not see its value. And snare is not the only utility wizards bring to a group. I have only three RL friends that still play EQ. 2 play mages. Two of the three play mages. I asked both how much dps they would be willing to give up to get snare. I asked them if they would give up 5% (remember snare is just one of our utilities), both not only said yes, they BOTH volunteered, independently that they would give up 15%, maybe more, just to have a snare. You may not value snare now, but I submit that if VI took it away from us, possibly as 'payment' for the requested increase in dps, your attitude would change dramatically. I know I would be mad.<br>
<br>
To even argue over the dps of a wizard is to concede the argument to those who say we don't do enough. You are letting someone else define the terms of the discussion. In so doing, you let them stack the deck in favor of the point they want to make. Just say 'no', admit that wizard sustained dps is less than class x and move on. The dps is not a reason to keep wizards out of that sought after single-pull group unless you let it be one.<br>
<br>
Now for the other point. This whole discussion has centered around attempts to get the 6th slot in a group that will always single pull mobs, with no risk of adds, trains, wipeouts, etc. Just steady exp killing with minimal risk. And the proposition was you were doing this not for social reasons, not for loot, but just to get exp. Why would any sane, competent wizard ever do this? Yeah, I have done it in the past, but still. Wizards are designed to be flashy. Hell, I equate 'nuke' with wizards. When I talk about design here, I am talking about the way we are now, with Lures, Familiars, maybe FT items and no manastones. I am not considering the so-called 'original' design from over 34 months ago.<br>
<br>
Wizards excel in risky, dangerous situations, and in AE. We not only have the most mana efficient nukes, we have the most time efficient nukes as well. And then there are the afore-mentioned utility spells, root, snare, stun, evac. Where we belong is in high-risk, high reward places. Doing the stuff that gets the adrenaline flowing. NOT just sitting there, waiting for mob 243 to be pulled, waiting some more for its HP to get low enough to nuke withut aggro, and then maybe one more nuke. Then medding again until mob 244 has been pulled and damaged enough. If that was what playing a wizard was all about, even 25% of the time for me, I would be playing some other class.<br>
<br>
Before you dismiss my point out of hand, sonsider this. What role does a rogue have in an AE group? A shaman? A Beastlord? Not a reasonable request to have a rogue in an AE group? From a rogue's point of view, why not? AE is hands down the best exp in the game. And yet these classes are not just lower dps than other possible classes, they really have NOTHING to contribute. Before you get bent out of shape over not making as large a contribution in a really very boring and, for a wizard, inappropriate sort of group, have pity on the rogue who will NEVER see the inside of an AE group.<br>
<br>
Its not that your answers are wrong. Its that you are answering the wrong questions.<br>

Fynalwiz, Raistin is in FoH.  I'd say that gives him plenty of right to post his opinion :P  I didn't see anything in his post that was offensive.  We can simply agree to disagree with his opinion.  After all, this board is called &quot;general discussion&quot;, and if only one side of an issue were allowed to post, then it wouldn't be much of a discussion :P<br>
<br>
Yugy, just a quick couple of comments.  Yes, snare is a powerful ability.  However I'd say its usefulness in the single pull, easy exp encounter group is very diminished.  I've been in conventional (read: non-aoe) groups a couple times a week now since luclin, mostly in dungeons, and only casted snare a few times.  We simply didn't need it.  I'm not saying snare isn't great, just saying I for one rarely use it.  I don't even keep it memed as one of my &quot;default&quot; spells.  Best use for it is to stop SoWed mobs from running and quading IMO.  Even when I duo mobs in the grey or maidens or fungus grove I never snare, its just not needed.<br>
<br>
And to my dismay, I saw a ROGUE in an aoe group yesterday.  Not a crappy aoe group that couldn't kill very fast either (he was the puller).  Sacrilegious!<br>

Torrid, you are missing the point amd arguing against statements I never made. I am not even sure what you have a problem with. I never said we should only have one side of the argument. In fact if you read the thread from the start, I posted about the need for criticism of Armok's post. I also never said his post was &quot;offensive.&quot;  <br>
<br>
But his post isnt the other side, it is a rant against some of the things he doesnt like on this board. He admitted to not even READING Armok's post before hijacking it and going off. Sorry dude, I can't &quot;agree to disagree&quot; with someone attacking a post they didnt even bother to read.<br>
<br>
I can &quot;agree to disagree&quot; with Yugy's post. It doesnt side with Armok, but it goes beyond rhetoric and generalizations. There is a difference<br>
