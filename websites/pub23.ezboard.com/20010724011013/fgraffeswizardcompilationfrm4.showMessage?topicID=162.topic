Ice comet was the ultimate spell and we would be powerful. well now the levels go to 60 and from what i hear, 50-60 we are screwed unless we are in uberguilds. it doesnt seem right to have to struggle from 1-49 just to have 2 or so levels of power. Verant failed to balance the 50-60 game for casters and instead of balancing, we get our specialty changed from dd and ports to just ports. you think i want to pay 10 bucks a month just so i can port you?! now that translocates are going in we are going to get bugged more then ever (&quot;well you dont have to zone so port me now!&quot;). If the 50-60 game for wizards isnt super insane, then i'd like to hear it from someone who has such a wizard, wasnt a twink to begin with, and is not in an uberguild. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwizardzapinsommaz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wizard Zapin Sommaz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.allcanadiantrees.com/eq/icon.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/6/01 11:48:35 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.allcanadiantrees.com/eq/Zapin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> You want to know about the post 50 Wizard?  We can still be very good if you put yourself in situations where you can truly make a difference.  Drop rain on mobs in Kunark and the 2k or so damage when all waves hit (which is more often than only one or less hitting) makes a good drop on the mob's HP while still being mana efficient enough to blast away at most every mob your group fights.  Seeing health move makes us feel very useful.  Plus don't be surprised to find yourself on snaring duty since it is a must in places like Chardok and groups in the know will look to a Wizard for this since we have decent damage and Evacuate ability.<br>
<br>
The best fun of any group for any class is AoE grouping (imo).  I prefer Howling Stones, but it is a rush in any dungeon.  Once again this is where Wizards excel and exp flies in these groups even as you approach 60.<br>
<br>
Want to feel useless?  Go to Velious.  There is a bit of fun to be had in Cobalt Scar in the early 50s, but after that the pure mass of HPs on mobs will make you feel useless as your mana drops and the mobs seem barely dented by your power.   You must remain content having jobs like being the &quot;Evacuate taxi&quot; that gets your group through Sirens Grotto etc.  I have found my fire spells to hit nicely in Velious including Kael, but with so many HP, who would notice.  Even stunning casters gets annoying because often they recover their casting even when the stun is not resisted.<br>
<br>
Soloing is still an option for me at 58 and in burning woods I can still round up 4 exp giving mobs to kite without too much searching.  Leave that LFG on and I find that I get invited more now in the late 50s than I ever have before.<br>
<br>
There is not a class in the game that will not have some people bitching about the high end game.  I think the trick is to be satisfied in what you can do and go places where you can still be valuable.  We can bitch about the damage a rogue can do without the need of mana, but I think anybody playing a rogue for awhile will miss the versatility of the Wizard class before long.<br>
<br>
PS.  Any other Wizards approaching 60 still wearing a SMR or worse, or is it just me? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><embed src="http://www.allcanadiantrees.com/eq/Zapin1.swf" width="280" height="160" quality="best" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">

Wizzies have been saying this for as long as I've been playing the game, but somehow I grouped and solo'd my way to 60 in no time at all.  Grimstaff been bitching about wizards for about 2 years now, but I bet he even still gets groups =)  Finding groups is all about reputation.  Are you fun to group with?  Good at your job?  Help out folks when not doing anything else?  See we have a highly sought after ability.  Porting folks when you aren't doing anything generates a lot of goodwill for you.  I know clerics and chanters who have little to no chance of ever getting a group cuz they just aren't good in group.  If you think you might need to up your rep cuz you play a wiz, help folks out.  Who knows, you might make some new friends. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvortextwin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>VortexTwin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/7/01 5:47:54 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Anti-Wizard Rant</span><hr size=1> Holy Quadrangle?<br>

If you stop to rant, you prove how little you know.  The trick is to take the qwerks, the unfair dismissals, the awkward mechanics, and use them to your advantage as a class BUT DON'T give up the fight for improvements in the process.<br>
<br>
Different servers have different ideologies.  I happen to have a very good reputation on my server with the people who have taken time to get to know the abilities.  However, even a good wizard will have times where groups will be few to none.<br>
<br>
Yes, reputation is a big part of it.  But even reputation can't change peoples opinion that we are a replacable class in almost every aspect.  There is not one aspect that we have such efficiency that it would be desired above another class, other than major mob raids.<br>
<br>
I have never slowed the pace of proving my skills as a wizard but at the same time, I won't rest to watch Verant add these PoS additions.  There are ways to rant.  You don't HAVE to stop doing what you are doing.  Suggestions can be made without slowing down your performance in game.<br>

Just been hearing and reading way to much about how bad we are post 50. I didnt mind struggling through the lower levels as long as it led to something. Seems still like we struggle only to end up average (or soloing). Oh well. At 45 i find myself doing more crowd control then DD already so no probs with snaring when no druids around. I do have a decent reputation but at the same time, i dont play daily and dont level fast seeing as i spend alot of time in low level areas giving the kids damage buffs and rooting their mobs when needed. So the people i grp with and get to know tend to pass me by level wise. seems like when i am LFG i always end up meeting a bunch of new people with maybe one person in the grp i know (sometimes). Another question Zappin, is there anything you are really looking forward to when you level now? do the spells get much better then the 49's? i find a 300dd lure at 45 to be quite useless exept that it makes me look buisy when fighting high red mobs i cant snare, root, or dd otherwise lol. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utargonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Targonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/7/01 12:06:10 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *calms down*</span><hr size=1> The issue as I see it is that we don't scale well from 51 through 59, and that causes us not to be as functional as we should be in this range.  Why can't our damage increase at an even pace from 51 through 60?  Why does there ALWAYS have to be this: New spell, +5 damage, +5 damage, +5 damage, +500 damage type of improvement?  Through the entire game, from level 1 through 60 we see this, though pre-50 we only had 3 or 4 levels to wait when it came to damage increases.<br>
<br>
Let's face it, when mobs increase their hit points by 500 or more per level, does it make sense that we only do 5 additional hit points/spell/level?  now, give us 50 hit points additional per level as an upgrade in the post 50 game, and we STILL don't get to do more than 1600 damage/cast, but we do a decent amount all the way from 51 to 60.  <br>
