Only grouping I did was in Mtns of Rathe and once with a guild wizzie who'd lost his level to help him get it back.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, I've solo'd The Overthere doing single and dual kites.  Triple and quad?  Not likely.  As many times as I've tried, I've failed for more than two.<br>
<br>
I think the primary elements of multi-kiting are:  Your mana pool and the mob resist rate.<br>
<br>
Mana pool:  Level 35 wizard with 199 INT.  An INT of 200 would give me SEVEN more mana.  I still want 200 INT, but I'm not overly concerned about that extra 7 mana.<br>
<br>
MoB resists:  as I go up in level, they resist less.  Strangely, I've multi-snared blues and yellows and had the yellow take and the blue resist.<br>
<br>
I've found in a perfect world, if I had four mobs rounded up and my AoE snare hit all four the first try, I'd be golden.  This *never* happens.  At that point, I'm in snare-recovery mode.  I have to leave my snared friends and take care of my uncooperative ones.  That may require one or more BoF cast.  Again, I need to round them up.  Again, I need to resnare the bunch of them -- probably more than once because one will resist the resnare attempt.<br>
<br>
At this point, I'm now down to half my total mana for my AoE nukes.  Yes.  I can not finish them off.  Even with Harvest.<br>
<br>
My last kills last night were a dual-kite yellow and blue succulents in OT.  Both were nearly dead when I went OOM and snare broke.  They wandered separate ways.  I cast Harvest and took out the blue with my big nuke.  Then, I followed the crawling yellow for a while, sitting to med every few steps.  After about a minute, I was able to finish it off.<br>
<br>
This situation is fairly typical.  I'm thinking at level 36, I'll get more 41 more mana.  That's almost one BoF cast.  Then, mobs will resist less too.  At 37, it'll be better and so forth.  Perhaps by 39 I'll be able to truly quad kite these mobs.  In short, while I've learned how to recover from a resisted multi-snare and reform a tight AoE mob group, I run OOM well before I can finish them off.<br>
<br>
Oh.  It's always nice to have your AoE nuke mem'd before you start your dual-kite.  I forgot last night after returning from Mtns of Rathe.  The snare went off *perfect* but I had to sit and mem my AoE.  Resnare for insurance.  OOM early.<br>
<br>
Mtns of Rathe:  Not worth the effort.  Blue HG's are way, way too much work.  Plus, the place is camped by 45-50'ish folks looking for easy cash.  The hilltop had a 50 mage up there killing everything in sight yesterday.  Sure, I loved looting the 39pp, 80gp, 66sp, and 99cp off that one HG, but was it *slow*.  <br>
<br>
Not only that, my son's 35 mage and I went totally OOM on one blue giant.  These things have massive HP and hit hard.  His pet lasted about 10 seconds then we were rooting, nuking, etc.  <br>
<br>
Back to OT I went.<br>
<br>
BTW:  I became amiable to Venril Sathir yesterday.  Finally.  After tons of Sarnak Berzerkers.  I got that hammer that proc's Gate Overthere.  Put it in the bank.  Guess what folks?  Amiable to Venril Sathir means the Drolvarg Sentry's *inside* Karnor's Castle are *amiable*.  Yeah.  I visited the castle on my way back to OT.  Sat down at the feet of a buddy Drolvarg Sentry.  The undead in the castle are still ready-to-attack.<br>
<br>
So, basically, I get IVU cast on me, and I can wander KC at will.  Good for me to get my Concussion spell quest going!<br>
<br>
As a bonus, Gorenaire came by the KC entrance and was gracious enough to allow me to /con her.  She's indifferent.  As an added bonus, someone at KC offered 100pp for a port to Nektulos.  Hee hee.  I took her.<br>
<br>
Did I mention the GM took my last name away?  Spankda Draggons is against the rules.  My bad for /petition'ing to have Draggons moved to Dragons.  I got on the &quot;to do&quot; list.  I'm trying to think up a new name.  I may just remain surname-less.  Maybe Fizzlepoo.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxaxia.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xaxia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://members.prestige.net/chosenofnorrath/images/xaxia.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/13/01 5:58:42 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://members.prestige.net/chosenofnorrath/images/xaxia.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Level 35 The Overthere Kiting and Spankda Report</span><hr size=1> Wow, I give you credit trying to multi-kite in OT at 35.  I started kiting there at 39 and had so-so success.  On a 4-kite, I got at least one resist about every other time.  At 40 (a nice hell level to quad kite), resists were down a lot.  And just yesterday, I got through all of 41, and let me tell you, quad kiting becomes a truly wonderous and beautiful thing in OT.  Resists become nearly nonexistent.<br>
<br>
As an example of quad kiting, let's focus on the lovely spiked succulent.  They vary in level from 32 to 35, but let's assume all of them are 35.  Also, let's define the level &quot;spread,&quot; that is, the difference between your level and the MoB's level.<br>
<br>
At level 41, I found I could successfully snare my 4-pull about 4 out of 5 times.  At 39, it was more like 50%.  Here's a hypothetical table of snare success rates for one MoB and for snaring all 4 MoBs based on level spread:<br>
<br>
Spread-----One MoB-------Four MoBs<br>
6.................95%.................81%<br>
5.................90%.................66%<br>
4.................85%.................52%<br>
3.................80%.................41%<br>
2.................75%.................32%<br>
1.................65%.................18%<br>
0.................50%...................6%<br>
<br>
I realize that at 35, you are not going to be quad kiting spiked succulents mainly due to mana constraints, but if you were crazy enough to try it, the table shows that 94% of the time, you'd be running for zone.<br>
<br>
It's surprising that even at level 37 (spread of 2) where your success of snaring ONE MoB is 75%, you're woefully inadequate to snare the 4 (success is 32%, or 1-in-3).<br>
<br>
On a quad kite at level 41, I was getting one and a half to two full blue bubbles.  This is INSANE experience, and I actually sometimes feel a little guilty that we can do this, and that no one else can (besides druids, beh, but not as well).  If you're not doing this at these levels, YOU SHOULD BE!  It's probably time to move on to the Spirocs, but I'm having to much fun in OT.<br>
<br>
There is nothing better than dropping your Quad in front of a group of 38-40's.  They just drop their jaws in amazement.  Actually, it's beyond that, I believe they think they're dreaming.... <p><i><b><font face="ARIAL" size="2" color="#00FF00">

It only gets better. By the time you get 39-40ish, your snare success rate will be much better, your mana pool will be large enought for a few extra snares or resists. You will find that a quading wizard really comes into the power in their low 40s. Try the thorks in EW, this quad heaven and should get you to 44 or so. You will make a killing selling the velium weapons and thork armor to merchants. Be sure to keep all of the Thork tusks you get so you can turn them in later for gems in Cobalt Scar. Stick with it, the rewards are worth it. <p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-famliy: arial"><b>Wandor Kilbringer<br>Wizard of the 47th Conclave<br>Vini, Vidi, Nuki</b></span><br>

I'm almost level 37 now (less than a bubble away).  <br>
<br>
I'm able to dual-kite almost every time.  A couple of strategies have come developed for this level range. <br>
<br>
1.  Get three and round them up.  Snare.  Those that resist, run off and root.  Go back and get the two you snared and kill them.<br>
<br>
2.  Often, I end up having to finish the mobs one at a time.  With variable resist rates, I may end up with one snared mob almost-dead and stationary and another still chasing me.  They're now separated.  I must finish them off separately.<br>
<br>
3.  While re-rounding and re-snaring is good experience for me (not XP wise but learning), it wastes so much mana I can almost never finish off even one mob.  I did succeed in a tri-kite early yesterday but the last Sarnak Knight was wandering slowly away, unsnared, and I was totally OOM.  I asked an SK to help but the guards got him.  Ugh.<br>
<br>
4.  MoB speed is key.  I will never attempt Rhinos and Tigers.  I can barely stay ahead of the Tigers and the Rhinos will run me down with TBoots.<br>
<br>
5.  It's gotten easier to snare as I've gained XP.  <br>
<br>
6.  I've begun solo-kiting Sarnaks, Cocks, and Succulents without snaring them first.  Using my TBoots, I just run ahead until my Staff of Temp Flux says I'm out of range, stop, do not turn, cast nuke, run.<br>
<br>
7.  You don't need to turn and face the snared MoBs to nuke them.  Just get out of range, stop, nuke, keep running.  <br>
<br>
8.  The biggest single reason to stay at The Overthere is I'm Amiable with VS now.  Hence, I can sit in the tunnel-entrance way to the Outpost with two nasty guards on either side of me, go AFK for 10 min whilst I meditate, come back, dual-kite, go sit in total safety again.  <br>
<br>
Plus, when things really do go bad (like I had a Tiger agro on me and I had one bub of health left) I can run to mommy and daddy guards for salvation.  <br>
<br>

The resist rate is much lower, I have more mana, and I hit a tad harder.<br>
<br>
At The Overthere, I ran to some ruins and found three Berzerkers inside.  I snared them all and AoE'd them with ease.  I've tri-kited before, but this was the first really easy tri-kite.  <br>
<br>
I'm finding I may have to finish one, two, or even all three separately.  I did succeed in a full quad-kite and then saw the cockatrice slowly coming up from way behind.  Apparently, I had lost that by nuking it until it stopped.  I finished two at once, then the last but didn't see the birdie still undead.  I was OOM by then.  It ran to the guards.  Ugh.<br>
<br>
I've also begun not snaring and kiting for single kites.  I simply nuke, run until my staff of temperate flux tells me I'm out of range, run a bit more, stop, pause, nuke.  I don't even turn around.  I start running immedately after the nuke goes off.  This process saves me the mana I would have spent on a snare attempt.  That's half a big nuke.  I can usually squeeze out one last kill this way if I have two bubbles of mana left.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubicrius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bicrius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/20/01 2:02:02 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://students.hamilton.edu/2002/bschulte/eqpics/bic_gin_sm.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Almost 39</span><hr size=1> Do yourselves a favor... don't quad in OT, it's harder there and there are too many wandering mobs.
