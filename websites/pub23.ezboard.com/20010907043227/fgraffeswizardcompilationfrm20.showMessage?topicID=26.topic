I am a good, intuative player having solo'd for most his wizards life. I tried in OT on low blues last night... it went terribly IMO.<br>
<br>
No I did not die... but I had a difficult time rounding up 4 things to kite at once. I pull a couple via one of the level 1 (FAST cast, low mana) ice spells but before I could locate more to fill in the group I would sometimes get too far away from my following mob and some would drop out. (I thikn 3 are following and then when I get the 4th to add... only 1 is now behind me... wth are the others?)<br>
<br>
I did get a bunch together finally and cast BoF ... 3 snared 1 resisted. By the time I got the 4th snared, my mob had broken up and I couldn't round them all back up again. Pain in the @$$.<br>
<br>
Question on views. What view do you use for doing this? I am trying this in OT with plenty of running room. I am becomming convinced that unless I take mixed groups it will take tooooooo long to locate 4 of a common species to kite. Also is there a good area with a higher density of things to kite for my level? (level 40).<br>
<br>
I absolutely agree I need to take a big step back and practice on low greenies... but this first attempt was rather discouraging. I could have solo'd a few higher blues in DL and got MUCH more exp than I did last night.<br>
<br>
No I'm not giving up but some advice on views, how to handle resisters of snare while not loosing your mob, where to find an area with 4 things to kite within a reasonable distance of each other etc etc etc would be helpful.<br>
<br>
Final question, what about low blue cyclop's like those in Rathe? I am I dumb for even thinking it? They rarely resist anything to me... can't have much more HP's than some of the OT creatures... good running room to kite... etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
Advice please... I really need to get out of level 40 :P<br>

<br>
First put staff of temp flux on a general invetory slot and then hot key it.  2 reasons:  1) No mana spell that agroes even if it gets resisted.  2) you can cast wille running to gauge how far you are from the crts following you.  Once you get the tell you are to far away from your target you can stop and cast snare.  Usualy snare can we cast before you get the mobs on you.<br>
<br>
Find a spot were 3 or 4 mobs spawn close together so if you aggro one all will come.  If not you have to make sure the mobs keep up with you and this is a pain specialy if you need to look for mobs that are far appart.  <br>
<br>
Use F9 to change your views and keep track of what is following you. Once you see that 3 or 4 mobs are with you cast your aoe snare.  If any of them resist target those and stop to snare them. Once all are snared run in circles that way it will get your mobs grouped together due to pathyng. Once they are all grouped SNARE THEM again.  Because by this time your snare time should be running out. <br>
<br>
Once all snared cast your aoe try not to use rain aoes just the ones with green background the once that are one wave but multiple targets.<br>
<br>
Also quad kitting pryor to lv 51+ is almost imposible due to the mana dmg ratio of your aoes. Also bonds is very unreliable i love my lv 51 shacle spell and Piller of frost spell.  Once you get those 2 you can become a quad kitting fool. But you need jboots, staff of temp flux, Shacles and Pof.  Doing this without any of this is hard almost imposible and by the time you are done combined with downtime from oom and or death makes quad kitting a waiste of time.  So stick to singles until you get lv 51.   Hope this helps<br>

You merely need 4 mobs that have the same movement rate and are suitable for aoe (e.g., mobs that cast spells are bad).  I never aoe'd in OT so I can't give you a run down of what runs at what speeds.  I'm guessing that most of that stuff runs at the same speed except for the rhinos and tigers but you can experiment and figure it out.<br>
<br>
Second, get a staff of temperate flux.  It's the ultimate toy for quad kiting and the quest is very easy.  It generates free aggro, is instant cast, and makes for quick determination for whether your targets are in casting range.<br>
<br>
Third, you have to keep track of where your kites are.  You will periodically have to stop to make sure they don't get too far out of range and wander off.  Once you get a feel for it you will find it's pretty much second nature and this won't be a problem.<br>
<br>
Fourth, since you are just learning how to do quadkiting, the easiest solution for targets that resist your snare is to just root them off and deal with the remaining three.  Later on you can get more sophisticated and learn how to re-snare mobs that resist without losing your snared mobs.<br>
<br>
Lastly, you will not get the hang of this after one try. :P  It takes practice but I promise you that if you get really good at it that it will pay off in spades.<br>

Not true, I started quadding at level 28 when I heard about it.  Didn't even need snare.  Anyhoo, after you get Crcle of Force there's plenty of places to kite before 51<br>

25-30 - Goblins, Sarnaks, Skeles just over the hill from the backdoor in LIO.<br>

30-34 - Camped a static spawn.<br>

34-42 - Dire wolves in Iceclad near the iceflows / dragon circle.<br>
<br>
You can supposedly quad dire wovles till about 45, but that seemed pointless with the exp.<br>
<br>
I didn't need to snare at all for any of these mobs.  In fact taking the time to snare probably slowed me down (resists, rounding up, yadda yadda yadda).<br>
<br>
Even with wolves you have enough time to get out of range, stop, turn a little to avoid an interrupt, cast, then start running again before they smack you down.<br>
<br>
It's REALLY close though -- not recommended for the easily frightened or dial-up connections. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Hell you can outrun unsnared dire wolves WITHOUT SoW, so certainly you don't need snare if you are sowed.<br>

It does seem to help keep them grouped a little though.<br>
<br>
Also want to add my /disagree to Nords re not quadding till 51, it's good to do well before that. /agree to Nords re getting flux staff, it is invaluable.<br>
<br>
Also Danenel even if you get jboots, I wouldn't use them, too slow. Buy sow potions for quadding and use the boots for travelling.<br>

2. It should be your responsibility to make sure your quad kites are out of other people's way, and I never bothered to waste time and mana to make people feel more comfortable with what I was doing (since I never came near them).  This is really only a problem at lower levels.<br>
<br>
3. Why on earth would you waste good money on SOW potions when jboots work just fine?  For travelling, perhaps, but for 60 seconds of quad kiting and 10 minutes of sitting on yer ass? <p><img src="http://ns.iicanada.com/scott/pimp.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umacksin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Macksin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/3/01 11:14:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> JBoots vs Potions</span><hr size=1> There's a very good reason.

<br>
I'll check with my shamman friends, but I do believe the SOW potions work as a spell cast by the current level of the shamman that made them, while JBoots work as cast by someone under 20th level.<br>

Granted it is not needed for many mobs. Some mobs are just plain fast, like recently when I was kiting snow griffs for the eggs. But you're right for most mobs it's not necessary, I just like the comfort factor. Probably that's another reason I snare, I like the security of it.<br>
<br>
As far as people interfering, there's nowhere you can be sure of there being no other people. That's why this is a MMORPG not a CFRPG. You can reduce the risk of other people interfering but not eliminate it.<br>
<br>
At lvl 40 I find there are a LOT of people who don't know how to behave around quadders. (ie leave us ALONE) I hope this improves.<br>

J-boot speed is the lowest SOW in the game, if I remember correctly (equiv to level 9 shaman SOW).

As for bubbas.. last night, yet again... I saw a Druid root kiting elites. He came upon me, and he snared my last drakkel for faction (he didn't see me kiting the other 3) so, to be nice, I told him, look, just buff or little heal ME when I am almost thru and you can get faction for all 4 (we had the &quot;you had FOUR?&quot; discussion) I will tell you when, wait for them to be almost dead! So I gather them up, get them snared, and before I land my first CoF, he CHLOROPLASTS me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Of course two wolves veer off after him, so I just gated, and pulled elsewhere after that. He had to waste mana on four greens, and I wasted 5 minutes herding. So he lost out on easy faction all night long, (he was deep in a faction hole) but I can't quad around ppl that are unpredictable, even though he seemed like a nice guy.<br>
