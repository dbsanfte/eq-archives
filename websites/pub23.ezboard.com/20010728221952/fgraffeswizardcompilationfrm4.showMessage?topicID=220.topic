I would add that its probably because people are whinning about Wizards since 2 years that you feel a need to be disgusted by this class. Well I played most of others EQ classes and there is nothing wonderful compared to us. Its the all design of EQ that is weak, not the Wizard class.<br>

It does you guys NO HARM WHATSOEVER to live the damn thing for a few weeks to try and help us in the balancing issue. NO HARM AT ALL. The guy runs his own website and you don't pay him for it.<br>

I actually think it's just verant stooges that are posting this shit to be honest.<br>

Maybe you don't agree that we have been royally screwed but you are in the minority. Even with that - why can't you just let us try and get some class balance for a few weeks instead if saying &quot;No, I'm fine, I'm balanced, I dont want Verant to spend another 3 minutes on this &quot;. You are selling all of us with that not just yourself.<br>

This sentense resumes what I think about this Wizards issue. It looks like its a fashion to say &quot;we suck&quot;. I am sorry if I hurt ones sensibility but we don't suck. <br>
<br>
Why are you asking people to whine and whine and whine so more complains you have more chance Verant will look at you?<br>
<br>
I am level 48 right now and not ONCE I felt useless. I was able to solo, to quad kite and to find groups. How can I find groups? Well I play this game as it was designed for: making friends. When you have friends and develop relationships you have no problem finding a group.<br>
<br>
I went on PoH, PoF, PoG, Guk, Icewell Keep and some more and I never felt useless. Of course when casts were resisted I my used 44 lure. Its only 360 DD but I didn't say to myself &quot;god I suck&quot;, I was glad to help my party as best as I could. <br>
<br>
Maybe most Wizards are frustrated because they don't have the power they think they should have, like being super mega nukers and having all other classes bind over them on sight... I don't have this power problem and I rather enjoy the teamwork.<br>
<br>
Of course I am asked for TPs and its sometimes boring. I TP people when I want to. Sometimes I am open to help sometimes I am not. I know how to manage my way of playing. I don't think its worse than an Enchanter who crack all the way, or a Shaman who SoW all the way, or a Cleric who Rez all the way. Think about them too.<br>
<br>
And about the Graffe's banner... well you are right its his site...<br>
<br>
And to conclude, the most amazing but sad reply I often see when you don't follow the mass is when you are called a Verant employee. lol.<br>

It looks like its a fashion to say &quot;we suck&quot;. I am sorry if I hurt ones sensibility but we don't suck. &quot;<br>
<br>
Your right we do not suck, however we are far from balanced. At this point we are the most UNbalanced class in EQ. Can we get by with what we have, sure. The most common misconception by Verant is saying that the only problems wizards have is dealing with the high end ubers where we can not effectivly do damage to a 500k hp mob. The problems stem far deeper then this. Half of our spellbooks are spells we will never use, be the spells do not function as intended. They are not worth the cost to use them or have such limited function that they are not practical. Untill the issues are addressed the class will remain &quot;broken&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Why are you asking people to whine and whine and whine so more complains you have more chance Verant will look at you?&quot;<br>
<br>
No one said whine. However it is very apparent that we need help. The greatest way to recieve that is to support each other in various forms of protest.  Graffe added Taxi to the greatest wizard site in EQ. Me personally did not buy the new Translocates and will not PORT/TL anyone that is not in my current group/guild/raid. We all have our ways  to protest, the common theme at Verant is that do we think by adding more to a class such as giving us TL's do we think that will harm you? This is the line absor feeds us. Personally yes I feel it does. Because in the time it took them to develop TL's and add authorization boxes, real issues could have been adressed. Such as lvl 26-40 resist rates, adding a group function ability. It also added about 40% more tells to every one of us for hey can you TL me etc. It did nothing to make our life easier. The implementation was to answer the problem adressed at a previous fan fair.  &quot; Hello Vearnt I play a warrior, after raids when we are getting ported around to get to our home cities to restock etc, i have to wait 10 minutes  for people to load while I wait for my turn to get ported to my destination. Is there any way we can cut down on my &quot;down time&quot; Answer, verant makes Translocates to bind points and  spire locations.  This had nothing to do with helping us. It was however covered as a new function for wizards.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am level 48 right now and not ONCE I felt useless. I was able to solo, to quad kite and to find groups. How can I find groups? Well I play this game as it was designed for: making friends. When you have friends and develop relationships you have no problem finding a group.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is the problem, people want to level fastest they can, from 51-60 levels become tedious. People want to kill with the most efficancy they can. In Pick up groups or guild groups most will take a rogue over a wizard for sheer performance.  Being able to quad is a short answer and something the majority of wizards felt forced into because of  LFG.  I am lvl 60. I never had alot of the problems that face the majority of our class but to not understand and see what most of our class is being put through is being blind. <br>
<br>
&quot;I went on PoH, PoF, PoG, Guk, Icewell Keep and some more and I never felt useless. Of course when casts were resisted I my used 44 lure. Its only 360 DD but I didn't say to myself &quot;god I suck&quot;, I was glad to help my party as best as I could. &quot;<br>
<br>
You have yet to enter the area of the game where you become useless. Verant often uses the line that they are balancing our class issue of not being able to help kill LArge HP mobs  by giving us Banes at 60. Nopw yes banes do answer the problem with the deep mobs of ToV. However most wizards will never see them.  Take average guild wizard that considers Rumbleroot or Fayle in PoG a Super Uber. Both of the mobs above have 250-300k hp.  A wizard may do 9-13k damage over the fight. EVERY other class will out damage them. When your main role is to do damage this represents a serious issue.  Also what of the other wizards that are foeced to use poor inefficiant lures to get by on the mobs like this.  Its very sad. Verant has basicly stated that they will not adress the majority of the mobs  in EQ that the banes do not already land on.<br>
<br>
&quot;aybe most Wizards are frustrated because they don't have the power they think they should have, like being super mega nukers and having all other classes bind over them on sight... I don't have this power problem and I rather enjoy the teamwork.&quot;<br>
<br>
Its all about teamwork, however.  When a mage nukes for 5% less then us and has a pet that hits for 75 damage a round  do you consider yourself balanced? The old rule was that well most other classes can't land nukes on ubers, however with all the debuffs thease days  almost anyone can land a nuke with debuffs. Compare a wizard to any other class thats purpose is to do damage and you will see that the problem is that we end up far out balanced.  Druids at 59 have the strongest DD in EQ.  Its purchasable off a vendor.  Sunstrike is rare from ROK dragons etc.  I dont need a 4k nuke, I need my class to become more efficiant.  Even if we got diciplines that prevented mana use for 30 secons, increased mana regen for 20 seconds, self evac/ grp evac, bonus damage , unresistable disc it would be a start. Make lower level spells mana requirement go lower as you level so in time a lvl 34 spell may only cost half of what it did when you were 34 at 60. We are the ONLY class that depends soley on our mana.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Of course I am asked for TPs and its sometimes boring. I TP people when I want to. Sometimes I am open to help sometimes I am not. I know how to manage my way of playing. I don't think its worse than an Enchanter who crack all the way, or a Shaman who SoW all the way, or a Cleric who Rez all the way. Think about them too.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As stated before its not the problem that we have them, its when we got them and why.  Other issues should have been adressed before this crap was added. Thats the issue, I would use them and help others if they had adressed anything on our list. Balancing wont happen before  SoL. They will use the new balance to help sell the game and make them more money. <br>
<br>
&quot;And about the Graffe's banner... well you are right its his site...&quot;<br>
<br>
That it is, he is right to post this bit of dark comedy on his site. Its known that Verant employees frequent here. Its about time that they realize we are sick of the crap we are being fed.<br>
<br>
&quot;And to conclude, the most amazing but sad reply I often see when you don't follow the mass is when you are called a Verant employee. lol.&quot;<br>
<br>
You have a right to your view and opinions. Just as I have mine, however you need to understand that not everyone enjoys the mockery that we have become, you need to see why things are done and understand that despite the fact some of us crawled to the upper tier of our class. We have many flaws, many issues and  lots of us 60's do hope that verant will make it a tad bit easier on the next generation of wizards. Take a look and you will see there are not to many of them entering the world. <br>
