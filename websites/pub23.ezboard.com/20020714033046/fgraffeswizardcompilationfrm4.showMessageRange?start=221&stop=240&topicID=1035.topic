I don't think I'm making myself clear enough.  A driver's license is a piece of paper saying that the government allows me to legally operate a car.  The license is not responsible for my driving skills.  It's just a laminated card.  The fact that I have one proves that I've passed a driving test, but the actual license doesn't make a better or worse driver.  More driving accidents are the result of poor drivers, not poor unlicensed drivers.

Or it would cost ME a lot of money.  It would be really unfortunate if someone were in an accident and expensive surgery was required to save their lives.  It would be even more unfortunate if this person was unable to afford the expensive surgery.  I wish that the world were fair and no one ever fell on hard times, but that doesn't happen.  I would suggest that the injury victim would have to establish some kind of payment scheme to repay the cost of saving his life.  It would ideally be something reasonable that wouldn't put undue stress on their personnal finances.<br>

In cases of people who are truly poor and have no effective means of repayment, I would hope that a private charity might step in to provide assistance.<br>

The license is not responsible for my driving skills. It's just a laminated card. The fact that I have one proves that I've passed a driving test, but the actual license doesn't make a better or worse driver. More driving accidents are the result of poor drivers, not poor unlicensed drivers. See where I'm going?<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I'm not sure I do see.  There are people who fail their driving test and are not allowed to drive.  They can still physically operate a car, but there are penalties if they get caught.  Most people will not operate a car if they cannot get their license.  This keeps those who are cannot pass the test (the very bad drivers) off the road.  The idea is you have to show basic competence with the gun to get your license.  You have to show the license to get the gun.  I think maybe I'm missing something in your statement.  Please clarify if I am.<br>

I do not expect any such thing the government. The government has no business funding health care and treating accident victims.<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The point is that hospitals usually do not have time to verify health insurance before operating on accident victims (and they will perform life-saving operations regardless).  Of course the financial burden falls on the victim if he/she does not have insurance.  Many of the people who do not have insurance cannot afford to pay the bill.  It's not a matter of setting up a payment schedule, they bills are often too much.  You can't force someone to pay more than they have.  So, the burden falls on the hospital, and hence on the government.<br>

There is no need for federal regulations of this kind. Privately-owned airlines should be able to determine the conditions under which they wish to provide services to consumers.<br>

I think that since Sept 11, you will have a hard time finding people who agree with you here.  If the airlines did not fly over populated areas, I would agree with you.<br>

Let me go back to an earlier analogy/example.  It might capture what I mean to say.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Imagine a world in which cars exist but no one is ever required to get a license to operate a car.  We would still have bad drivers and we would still have accidents.  I believe that, like in the real world, the vast majority of drivers would simply go about their business every day without ever getting in accidents.  Some folks would probably go their whole lives without a car accident and would never have been licensed to drive their car.<br>
<br>
Those who are bad drivers and get in accidents would simply bear the same liability that bad drivers would have in the &quot;licensed world&quot;.  My point is that it's not too much of a stretch to think that the world would function as it does now if there were no driver licensing procedure or law.<br>
<br>
NOW are we on the same sheet?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I agree that you can't force someone to pay more than they have.  But if one person needs one year to pay for their surgery and another needs ten years, then that's just the way it goes.  As I said earlier, I believe that private charities would exist to help defray costs.<br>

If the true effects of the airlines' lax security were allowed to play out, then things might change.  The government has stepped into stop the billions that the airline companies have lost.  But airlines have suffered tremendous financial damage from their lax security.  It's unfortunate that the government has forbidden lawsuits against the airlines, since I believe that those companies whose planes were used should be held liable for what their planes did.  I think that if the airlines feared lawsuits from passengers that died due to faulty security (i.e. someone shoots someone on the plane), then you'd see better security.<br>

Gun control would still be unacceptable.  It's not that I have a particular fanaticism for guns.  It's that I don't think that the government should have the right to tell me what methods I can or can't use to defend myself.<br>
<br>
If the government is allowed to have it, then so am I.  Does this mean that I think private citizens should have F-14s with Hellfire missiles?  Probably not.  Should private citizens have light machine guns?  Sure, I'd be OK with that.  Speaking from the hip, citizens should have free access to anything man-portable that isn't explosive.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Brahma Atman Erudite Wizard Bertoxx</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/urhineheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rhineheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/18/02 8:59:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=237>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> For some reason, Anti-gun activists are generally more civil than Pro-gun activists in this thread (If you would like me to back this up, go count the personal flames and attacks made from each side in this thread.).

<br>
Brahma, you seem to be a very logical person with exceptional debating skill. Now why would you backup Faithkill's illogical arguments and attacks on other people? Just because he agree with you on the issue?  <br>
<br>
Here is an example:<br>
<br>
Quote from Faithkill:<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
&quot;Everybody should go through self defense training, at the very least.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Why? Because if they do not do so they deserve to be victimized?<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
<br>
What kind of argument is that? If I claim &quot;Everybody should have a healthy diet, at the very least.&quot;, are you going to say &quot;Why? Because if they do not do so they deserve to get fat and die a painful and slow death?&quot;<br>
<br>
A lot of Faithkill's arguments are extremely flawed, so why do you continue to back him up?<br>
<br>
You require Anti-gunners to backup their claim with evidences. Faithkill used the Australian gun ban in 1997 as the evidence to backup his claim that gun control will increase crime rate.<br>
<br>
I did a little check up on this and here is what I found:<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.snopes2.com/science/stats/ausguns.htm">Urban Legends Reference Pages: Science (Australian Guns)</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
My god, is that how you quote statistics? You quote the increase as NUMBER increase, not percentage increase of the population. In a growing country, of course the NUMBER of homicide would increase. The percentage of homicide has not really increased since the gun ban.<br>
<br>
If this is how you make up your evidence, this pretty much discredit all the other evidence you brought up.<br>
<br>
Finally, for the record, Aurianne's argument in general was a lot better than Faithkill's. More importantly, Aurianne was more CIVIL. There is no need to be rude just because someone else does not agree with you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubonegruel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bonegruel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/19/02 12:49:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=238>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Got to agree with Brahma on this one.

I've always wanted to be a surgeon, but Nooooooo!, the government has to step in and require qualifications and licenses.  I'm pretty good with a scapel, and have a fair idea of how people are put together, and I once performed reasonably complex surgery on a sheep (which would have been fine if my professor hadn't insisted it be put-down afterwards);... so I figure that I'm at least as competent as half the sawbones out there to perform small amputations and corrective surgery, maybe even a bit of cosmetic surgery.  <br>

Aurianne made a simple claim that self defense is a good thing that everyone should at least learn some so that it might help them one day.<br>
<br>
To me, Faithkill respond was a bit rude. But of course, that was my option.<br>
<br>
Does such a simple, non-provocative claim required such a harsh respond? Does anywhere in Aurianne's post even hinted that whoever does not learn self defense should be victimized? If not, what on earth was Faithkill talking about?<br>
<br>
Now, why does this simple claim have anything to do with legislation?<br>

Of course, it is my opinion that Aurianne had a better argument. Such as it is your opinion that Faithkill is better. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and no one's opinion is wrong.<br>
