Our monk split the warlord room and had the warlord pulled out from under him, but that's Karnor's for you.  It was some consolation that the group that stole our spawn was unable to handle him and ended up training him to the zone.  Somehow, our warrior was on the hatelist and got summoned to the zone, which is why there is a Call of the Hero listed in my spell log.  Our group was monk, mage, warrior, paladin, druid, cleric.  We had no chanter or shaman, and at no point did I ever feel we were in real danger.  The monk is an awesome puller, and we never had more than 2 or 3 mobs in the camp at once, and when we did the druid effectively used root for crowd control.<br>
<br>
It seemed to me that the primary limiting factor was mobs to pull, and time spent pulling.  I was low mana most of the time, but we never had to rest for mana at all.  One reason I want to post this, is that it was an enchanterless/shamanless/bardless group.  We had no haste, no clarity, no slow, and no mez.  We actually had people complaining that we were pulling the hands from skel captian while otm(no one else was pulling from there, the complainers were people sitting at the zone watching camp checks)<br>
<br>
I used the total pet combat time over the overall time to determine combat uptime for the Magician and the Druid.<br>
<br>
Overall camp time = 3079 (00:51:19)<br>
Camp time spent in combat = 1384 (44.95%)<br>
xp messages = 28 (average of 33 per hour)<br>

<br>
Estimates for damage shields and pet procs:<br>
<br>
~597 recorded hits from mobs.<br>
<br>
4 casts of Boon of Immolation(I think ~1,200 seconds, or 38% overall time).  If half of the DS time was spent in combat, a rough guesstimate says damage shields could have been active for about 65% of the hits, which is about 388.  It was a 25 point DS, so a guess of about 9,700 damage from damage shields.  (Also, there is some damage shield damage listed under magician nukes, since I was lazy and didn't edit out my own DS hits, which added up to about 250).<br>
<br>
113 recorded hits from pet procs.  Resist rates are completely unknown.  I believe the Max possible damage per proc is 104, so the maximum possible proc damage would be 11,752.  I have a feeling there is a fair amount of partial resists, however.  Given a 75% partial resist rate, the pets would have done 8,814 from procs.<br>
<br>
Here are the numbers adjusted for DS/proc guesstimates.<br>
<br>
55 Mag ... 59,378 ... 54.78 ... 19.28 (35.2%) (1084/3079)<br>

Preliminary conclusion would confirm what most mages already believe to be true, that is that we're fine in low-mid 50's xp groups.  One thing to note, however, is that an enchanter would actually have a mixed impact on relative value of the magician.  The mage would get clarity, which would increase the nuking portion of mage damage, but the pet would either not get hasted or be hasted for a net increase of about 5-6% more damage.  Slowed mobs would mean less damage from damage shields.  Mezzed mobs would make strategic nukes less important.<br>
<br>
Also note that, while overall I did significantly more damage than a typical wizard would be expected to do, the nuking portion only came out to 4.77 dps over time.  See actinic percussive's Dog Captian data with no clarity.  He was about 10.4 dps for a similar length session, their clarityless group averaged 41 kills per hour.  Armok's &quot;naked&quot; karnors log hypothesizes a level 51 wiz hitting 10.4 dps as well.<br>
<br>
Anyway, there are a few Karnors logs now posted here on the site, and here are the kill rates for them:<br>
<br>
My log(no haste/clarity) : 33 kills per hour<br>
Naked in Karknors(with c2) : 33 kills per hour<br>
Karnors eq. no clarity: 34.3 kills per hour (32 kills per hour after mana level control)<br>
Actinic no clarity : 41 kills per hour<br>
Actinic RCY Karnors with clarity : 39 kills per hour<br>
<br>
Anyway, I just wanted to point out that a group doesn't need clarity to work, nor does having clarity ensure a better rate of xp gain.  My theory is that levels, skill, and the ability to work together are far more important than whether or not you have haste and clarity.  Mez is powerful, but obviously not needed in Karnors. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uarmok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Armok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Need a log parsed?</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/2/02 11:04:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=603.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Level 60 shadowknight soloing in Velks</span><hr size=1> (copied from the general forum on 1/2/02)<br>
<br>
This is a wizard board, but I thought it would be important to show the effectiveness of high level melee classes soloing for experience, in order to compare it to wizard soloability. This shadowknight is level 60, and very well equiped (with primal 2hs and paladius axe from Vulak). He uses the primal until he procs avatar, then he switches to paladius to get the better damage output (it is a 51/42 weapon with an 80 pt proc). This SK logged about an hour of fighting (54:26 actually). He was engaged for 23:26, or 43% of the time. Average fight time was 94 seconds.<br>
<br>
lvl class ... total dmg ... dps ... total dps<br>
60 shd ... 89929 ... 63.96 ... 27.53<br>
<br>
Of his damage, 17481 came from spells (mostly procs and lifetaps, to keep himself healed).  He took a total of 25915 damage, and was only self buffed (meaning no clarity and no haste). Over the course of the log, he killed 15 mobs, or a rate of 16.5 mobs/hr (also 16.5 mobs/hr/person).<br>
<br>
I find it interesting to note that his kill rate almost exactly equals that of a quadding wizard, though the mobs he's killing are all deep blue and so will give better experience.  His risk factor is probably about the same as a quadding wizard because of his FD ability if things get nasty.<br>
