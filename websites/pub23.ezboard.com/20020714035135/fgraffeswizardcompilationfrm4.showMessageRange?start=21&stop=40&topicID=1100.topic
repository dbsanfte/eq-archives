So you get very contrived stuff, much of which could be written by the same 5 guys in some office somewhere and mailed out to band01 through band157.  The days of epic rock albums like Pink Floyd's Animals are well behind us.<br>
<br>
Don't feel bad though; pop, r&amp;b, jazz, and even gospel music are going through the same homogenization.  American culture mandates that every city has to have the exact same 50 chain restaurants and stores in the same generic-looking suburbs.  It's foolish to expect 'air play' music to be any different.<br>
<br>
Regarding the bastardization of your classic rock station, at one point the Sonys and Virgin Recordings etc. of the world paid kickbacks to stations based on playing time.  Not sure if it still happens, but I don't know why it wouldn't still be happening.  If I were a struggling radio station and I wanted to make a bit of extra cash I'd have two choices - bring in more listeners and amp advertising fees or cave in and take free money to put on what the big recording agencies tell me to play.  Pretty easy to see which direction your station went in. <p><BR>

Besides the political tripe that is involved with rock and roll, it's just plain fun. If you can't have fun dancing around to Supertramp or Boston then I feel sorry for you tiny man. Rock isn't always about breaking the rules, that mantle was given up to Punk Rock a long time ago. <br>

I feel it had more to do with seeing a music legend in the flesh, and knowing it might be my only opportunity to see a band of that caliber live, since nothing lasts forever.  Seeing Pink Floyd in concert was on my list of things to do in my lifetime and after spending nearly 24 hours in line at Wherehouse for tickets, I had done it.<br>

I realize that I should have clarified my earlier statement about not supporting rock n' roll. Soa llow me to do so: I don't support buying new rock. I won't pay more than $20 to see a good show. I do however patron clubs and support music on a local level. It is my experience that once money starts to figure into the picture, the heart of it all, the music, begins to die. And it's not a sudden death, its a degridation and its very sad to watch.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that musicians should be poor vagrants, making money off of music wouldnt be a bad job. But when you take something that has heart and soul and turn it into a figure on the billboard chart it corrupts the essence of the music.<br>
<br>
And by now, you should know that having major label sponsorship is not the end all be all of musical existance. Signing with a major label is not the only viable way to get your music listened to and appreciated.

I sure hope some working musicians are listening to this, because this is massively insulting.<br>
<br>
First off, musicians are in it to entertain people and to share their creations with others. The requirement that they have to be poverty-striken and share their music through Web sites or something is beyond strange, it's outright hostile to them. Why would you ask someone good enough to have people pay for them to do nothing but create music forgo that? Is working at Starbucks somehow a font of artistic inspiration that somehow Julliard has failed to notice?<br>
<br>
Is there a requirement that musicians can't actually take their talents and have a good and comfortable living from it? Why is it OK to make millions of dollars if you're born 7 feet tall and can palm a basketball and not OK to make millions if you're an amazing guitarist who writes soulful lyrics?<br>
<br>
And a major label is CERTAINLY the only way musicians ever make the sort of living other professionals do. I dated the daughter of a mid-level Atlantic seaboard rock star, and he worked his ASS off, touring four days out every seven with a child in high school and a house he owned in a DC suburb. The only way he could make ends meet was to have that record contract money -- he told me so. And the David Rose Band played big venues constantly. Should he have forgone having a family because he needed to live in a shithole somewhere with his muse?<br>
<br>
Do you have the same stipulations for authors? Should they be writing stuff they publish at Kinko's and are only seen by a few hundred people, or is it OK for them to get a publishing contract? And if it's OK, why is it OK for them? If it's no OK, why not?<br>
<br>
How about other creative types? Should we not have a film industry and just nothing but amateur films? Should we be boycotting the next Star Wars movie because Geoge Lucas is a zillionaire and making films that no film student could create?<br>

I actually do think that the rules should be simillar for authors. I think that most of the hogwash published is dumbing down America more that television is.

You never said diddly about &quot;big money music.&quot; But your last statement is pretty much what you said before. &quot;Money kills music.&quot; What the hell are you talking about?<br>
<br>
Are you going to say that the Beatles never produced anything worth a damn? That was the biggest money of its time, and even by today's standards is nothing to sneeze at. Was that music killed? Lennon made insane amounts of money for his solo work later on, which was intensely personal and driven by his own muses (no one else would have had Yoko's crap on their records otherwise). Please explain how money had killed John Lennon's music.<br>

Yes, there are crappy bands out there. There have ALWAYS been crappy bands out there. Fred Durst would be a no-talent hack whether or not he had a record contract. Surely, as touch as you are with the local music scene, you've seen that it doesn't take money to produce bad music. It's an independent phenomenon and as relevant as saying Fred Durst has bad facial hair, and that's why he sucks.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Sports are pure entertainment and physical ability.

It most certainly did affect his work, since his history plays were all about how swell his patrons' ancestors were and establishing that there was a proper line of succession. Terry Pratchett's &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; has a major plot element parodying exactly this. Of course, &quot;Henry V&quot; and the other history plays are amongst the most revered pieces of art in world history. And yet ... money was involved. You know what? Money doesn't make a damn bit of difference. Those terrible, horrible, wretched folks in every college's creative writing classes weren't corrupted by money. Because money doesn't make a damn bit of difference.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I have. And a lot of this is based upon the experiences of my family and friends.

Art wasn't some magical wonderful protected sphere until that villain Marconi invented radio. Art and commerce have been intertwined since the beginning. Deciding that money screws up art is willfully ignoring the facts, and is a cop-out excuse to explain why certain artists haven't made it, when the real reason is that they're unlucky, or maybe they just suck.<br>
<br>
Tell your family and friends to take an art history class. They'll find it enlightening.

<br>
It's all just typical of a culture that believes that money &gt; art. It's a deeper problem than just business and making sure people have food on their tables. It says something bad about our country when the majority of people would rather watch TRL than listen to something that has meaning. And I believe that money is the reason why things are this way.<br>
<br>
Money and trends are why major labels pick up and promote crap like Limp Bizkit. We already agree that they suck, so my question is &quot;Why do people listen to Limp Bizkit and not Stravinski?&quot; And my answer would be that it is because <br>
<br>
1: People would rather turn their brains off than have them stimulated by something meaningful. <br>
2: The reason none of this will change is because money, (ie: the motivation for any label picking up a band) has corupted the art by making a big label pass over something good, so they can rake in the dough on some no-talent crap like Korn, or Limp Bizkit, or Bush, etc...<br>
<br>
I can see this is getting out of hand, so I'l stop now.<br>
It's okay, we just have very different opinions on the subject. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
