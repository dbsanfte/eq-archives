<br>
This is probably going to get me seriously flamed, but I think it's worth saying anyway.<br>
<br>
I've been reading rant forums for a long time, even posted a few rants myself on the old EQ boards when I was a younger wizard. Pretty much any site that deals with wizard topics has one. And some concerns are valid: better mana regen would be nice; a higher damage cap would be nice; being able to get Concussion/Brain Bite at level 39 would be nice; a DD that does 2000 at level 59 or 60, not just to a few epic mobs in the game, but to any mob, would be nice and, I feel, appropriate. <br>
<br>
But after all the ranting, I'm happy being a wiz. No, I'm not 60 yet, so I don't know the woes of those last 11 levels. Maybe I'll hit 55 and retire to start a monk. But right now, life is good.<br>
<br>
I think the problem is that most people start a wiz expecting to do the most damage of any casting class in the game. We do if the fight is shorter than 15 seconds; after that, pet classes do. What most people don't realize is that to do more damage than we do already, the entire aggro system would have to be changed. You can't do more damage than your tank's damage + tank's taunting if you don't want to get hit (and any slack that concussion buys you). Pet classes get to do more in the long run because that aggro isn't directed at them. So if you want more damage, you're playing the wrong game, unless you like tanking. Reworking the whole aggro system would be practically impossible and would change the game so much that it wouldn't be the same game at all.<br>
<br>
Another problem with all the focus on damage is that many wizzes almost totally ignore their stuns. Markar's clash stuns for 8 seconds and does 200 damage. That's a good deal in my book. Combined with Tishan's clash you can come close to chain stunning. I was in Frenzy last night, and I stunned the entire fight, only nuking once at the end. The damage you can save your group is incredible with these stuns. Yeah, chanters get more stuns earlier than we do, but they also have a lot more to do in a fight, where we have the luxury of devoting our attention to that one mob. Use your utility spells; your cleric will love you, your tank will love you, and you'll be more useful.<br>
<br>
Then there's the issue of mana efficiency. I too would like to be a bit more mana efficient, but then again I have a chanter in my group in 99% of important situations. Casual soloing or grouping is... well, unimportant in my book. I can still get more experience soloing for an hour than most classes can get in a group all day. In deep excursions into hostile territory, when everyone *needs* the highest mana regen or everyone dies, if you don't have a chanter with you, you're dead already.<br>
<br>
Also, if you're low on mana and your group is at full health, DON'T NUKE! Let your cleric do their thing. Help them out with a stun here and there so they don't go from FM to OOM in ten seconds, and relax. Don't be a hero.<br>
<br>
Ok, now the dreaded topic: ports. I love my ports. Sometimes I gate around from continent to continent for no reason. I'm probably on of the few wizards that never charges for a port, either. If I have the time *and* I'm in the mood, I'll give you a port. That's maybe once or twice a day. I still turn down 90% of requests, even when they offer 100pp, or they say d00d I died in Oasis and I'm bound in qeynos, plz plz plz help me.<br>
<br>
Yes, in many situations people will take a res over an evac, and you could say that decreases their worth. But when some moron trains you, or your drunken tank pulls five right after your cleric says &quot;OOM!&quot; and your cleric has zero chance of living or camping, people want one thing: to get the hell out of there. I don't evac very much; maybe twice this month that I can think of. In that same time the local clerics have performed hundreds of resses. I still wouldn't give up my evacs. Not for a 2000dd, not for a wizard only clarity spell. A lot of wizards disagree on this point. That's just my opinion. Druids get evacs, nukes, dots, and healing spells. They're an uber class, no one's arguing about that. I still like my wiz better.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying our class couldn't use some tweaking. But other classes could, too. Rangers come to mind.<br>
<br>
If you're that unhappy with your wizard, play another class. That's a solution I know most wizards hate to hear, but let's be real here; if you hate your girlfriend/boyfriend, you dump 'em, even if you've put many months into the relationship (all of you married folks don't jump on me, it's just an example, heh<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ). If you hate reading Bukowski, stop buying his books. If you hate hearing me say the class isn't that bad, read another thread ;p.<br>

I think most of the complaints come from those over 50 exploring the lands of Velious; the length of the levels, the higher hps of the MoBs, the distance between port locations, etc...all starts piling up. It's easy to get discouraged.<br>
<br>
For *most* (avoiding a flame from Grim) wizards under 50 and roaming the old original continent, life is still grand.<br>
I encourage you to keep your head up though.<br>

I'll give you a bit of information about what you can expect from 51 through 55 since I've been dealing with the pain of it for long enough.  Corrections are welcome from any who disagree.<br>
<br>
51: Ok, you just got to 51, and you get this nice spell called draught of fire.  643 damage in 3 seconds feels amazing, all those interupts are gone, and on paper, this means you can do 1286 damage in 6 seconds, which is a nice little upgrade from Ice Comet, it's fire based, and the resist rate isn't too bad at all.  So, life seems good.  Spend some time and you get Atol's Spectral Shackles, and you now have a spell that works fairly well.  Many groups will accept you to replace that druid for snare duty.  Karnor's Castle is the best place in Kunark since the mobs don't have TOO many hit points and the experience is decent.  You will also find groups on many servers as a wizard in this zone, contrary to popular belief.  If there is room for you, you CAN find groups here.  A bit more time spent, and you get Tishan's Discord, a GREAT stun spell.<br>
<br>
52: You get your first lure spell, only does 640 damage, doesn't scale up.  Your draught spell from 51 does a whole 5 damage more per cast, while the mobs seem to have gotten an extra 200+ hit points from 51 to 52.  Lure also gets resisted by just about everything you'd want to use it on, so those spite golems in Hate will STILL resist 5 out of 6 casts(lure of fire at level 55 is only slightly better on these).  No additional damage this level.  But, manaskin will fully replace diamondskin, same reagent cost, and it has +1 mana/tick, which is nothing, but over time it's SOMETHING at least.  Now, the very big positive, Tears of Druzzil.  This spell will do 600 damage per wave, and if cast on a single mob, will do up to 1800 damage if all three waves hit.  It's magic based, and generally 2 waves will land.  Old Sebilis groups are hard to get, and Karnor's is still good experience at this level.<br>
<br>
53: Jyll's static pulse, 2 second PB AoE that does 495 damage.  All those green zones that used to be so annoying are now not even a problem.  A greenie jumps you, just cast this, and with a 2 second cast, it almost never gets resisted.  Aside from that, 53 doesn't hold anything.  Lure of frost still does only 640 damage, and draught of fire does 653 damage now.  Not too exciting, but it's better than getting interupted with a 6.3 second ice comet or rend cast.  KC is starting to get slow for XP at this point unless you move to hands or basement.<br>
<br>
54: Ok, an AC upgraded shield spell, and a magic based draught(voltaic draught), 658 damage on this one, same 3 second casting time and same 215 mana cost, magic based.  But, draught of fire does the same damage with the same exact stats.  Nothing to get excited about since mobs resist magic more than fire in 90 percent of all cases.  KC is really slow on XP now except hands or basement, so you begin to push for groups in OS, or if you are lucky, you may get into a Howling Stones group.  54 is a definate hell level, slow XP, and in general, it's not a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
55: Ok, a new lure, gets resisted a little less on certain mobs, more than on others, but in general, it's just fire based.  Same exact damage as our level 52 lure.   Draught of Jiva is the magic based draught, consider it like Voltaic draught, but it DOES interupt casting.  Same exact damage, cast time, and mana cost.  Improved invis from Velious is self only, but makes it less of a risk to run through certain zones like Kael.  Truesight is just a combination of chill sight and see invis.  It's nice, but nothing new.  OS begins to open up, you've hit level 55, so are a bit more accepted.  The places you will want are Ilis Jail or Myconid King since these are where the XP will be best.  These groups generally need to be selective about who they invite, since a single group member without the skills to work as a part of the group can and will get the group killed.  The next rain also comes at 55, but in OS, tends to get resisted more than Tears of druzzil.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some will note I've left the pillar spells out.  The reason is that except for AoE groups and &quot;green zones&quot;, the AoE spells arn't generally tolorated well in groups.  The mobs have a LOT of hit points, so crowd control is THE most important thing.  Now, one thing that many groups will appreciate is you risking yourself to save the cleric or enchanter in your group.  If you keep a skin up(manaskin, diamondskin, or steelskin), you can be confident enough that you can take a hit or two without getting in trouble.  Because of that, if you need to nuke-agro a mob to yourself to give the enchanter 10 seconds to cast a mezz, it's worth it.  Just remember to STOP casting, or switch to immobilize and concussion(for those who have it) to let the tanks get the mob back off you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Being a wizard means you need to use every bit of skill you have to not only stay alive, but to keep your group alive.  If you get into groups, and they see you helping with crowd control, snares, stuns, roots, and just working with your group, they not only mind if you sit out for a few mobs to med, but they appreciate you.  Just remember to tell them when you go under 20 percent mana because if you don't, and they pull a train without knowing it, they may expect YOU to evac when you can't.  Wizard group skill isn't easy, and learning what you can and can't do can take a LOT of practice.  Learning how to agro a mob just enough to have it agro you, but not so much that they can't get it off quickly is also critical.  Even at 55, there are a few times when I over-agro the mob, but thanks to concussion, the times are getting fewer and fewer.<br>
<br>
Final topic is Concussion.  This spell is CRITICAL at the higher levels.  At 54, when you run into problems getting groups(if you have that problem), that may be a good time to get a group together to get it.  My recomendation is to get a mage with CoH.  Duel the mage, and use gravity flux to get the mage to the top of the wall.  The mage can then CoH your whole group up, and the human skeleton camp is GREAT XP from 51 through 54.  Hell, you might want to do that camp just for the uncontested XP camp alone.  You will need a decent enchanter, but for a good XP camp, they generally won't object too much.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck.  The 50s are painfully slow, especially level 54, so the best thing is not to dwell on that pathetic 5 HP increase in damage per level, and just try to focus on working well in a group.<br>
