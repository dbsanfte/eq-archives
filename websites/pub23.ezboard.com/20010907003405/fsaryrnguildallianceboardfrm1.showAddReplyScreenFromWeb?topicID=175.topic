I for one have had a hard time getting to know the regular crews from each of the guilds in the SGA in the time since we expanded the alliance to 4 guilds.  <br>
<br>
Currently i feel like i DO know quite a few people in each of the guilds, but i also feel like i have put a lot of effort into it.  Im wondering how much of our membership feels like they are ready to expand the alliance again.  It would be interesting to hear comments from the rest of you.  <br>
<br>
I will admit that i was a little uncomfortable with the expansion of the alliance to 4 guilds, but that now i am quite happy that it occurred.  <br>
<br>
It seems to me that we need to come up with a list of criteria that can be used to help guide us in our decision to expand or not.  Perhaps if we examine whether or not the current union is fulfilling its purpose and meeting its goals that will tell us whether we should be expanding.  These are just suggestions.  <br>
<br>
Im somewhat curious to know which (if any) particular guilds are already being considered for inclusion.  It almost seems like we need to agree on a procedure to be followed to include a new guild before we do in fact add any more.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I would say that i am ever so slightly in favor of a little more expansion at the present moment.  <br>

<br>
If the alliance is found lacking in anyone of the following areas, we should seriously consider adding a new member.<br>
<br>
1. Planes Raid personal; especially clerics, enchanters, monks, and rogues.<br>
<br>
2. Raid leadership.<br>
<br>
3. Events for all levels.<br>
<br>
4. Trade skill masters. <br>
<br>
5. Participants for SGA events.<br>

<br>
In fact, the reason we have not added another guild at this time is the lack of unity (or rather everyone seemingly abstaining) for one choice.<br>
<br>
So... what needs to happen for &quot;someone to make a decision&quot;??? In this thread name who you would like to see added, and why. Over 10 different guildnames have been brought up at one time or another. To differentiate these guilds we need our members to make some choices on who they would like to see join us.<br>
<br>
I had asked that this be discussed on your boards with your members and a decision be brought back here. I haven't seen any decisions from any of the 4 guilds, so let's move that discussion here.<br>
<br>
What will happen? We will invite the selected guilds to join us on a few of our raids to be sure they are what we expected them to be. At that time they will be invited.<br>

As with any guild, not every single person in them, (or in SF, SG, Amnesty, etc) is my favorite---I only mention this because Holt, please have a caution before dismissing one guild out of hand. Whatever your slight was, I recommend reconciling it between yourself and the party involved. <br>
<br>
The arguement against adding more members due to lack of coherency is a strong one, I agree. Except, this is the thing: at its core the SGA offers the possibility to do something small guilds cannot do on their own---that is, raid. This idea is bound to be popular.<br>
<br>
As long as any guild maintains the respect and loot rules set forth by the SGA, I would hope that their members would be included.<br>
<br>
If adding more bodies makes more work, then we need to set up procedures to streamline this. Database with member lists, Periodic meetings between guild officials, a prodedure for greivances, etc, etc. Not everyone in all of these guilds will use the SGA. For those that do (and may all they be enchanters and clerics :P) set up strict guidleines and there shouldnt be any problems. <p><b> ~The Nightblind Bard~

For this reason i was earnestly looking forward to the possibility of having them added to the SGA... <br>
<br>
However it would seem that the last few weeks have not been kind to VC.  Apparently, this guild may be about to disband after a failed attempt to ally/merge with Travellers of Norrath.  I have been told that their GL left the guild recently.  I know for a fact that Elian, the officer who initially signaled their interest in the SGA is no longer with them.  <br>
<br>
It is unfortunate that this happened to VC, but it does bring out the point that crafting an alliance can put a guild under stress.  If this past weekend's hate raid is any meaure of success, it seems clear that the SGA has been a real boon to our guilds' memberships.  Personally, I greatly enjoy the company of my SGA brethren, so feel i must urge that we proceed with care.  It would be a tremendous shame to have our attempts to expand the SGA lead to its reduction or demise.  <br>

<br>
Ok, you asked for it.<br>
<br>
1.  I was under the impression that there was a representative from each guild in the SGA council.  This representative was to vote on matters concerning inviting new guilds.  I don't see how hard this is ?  There are only 4 guilds now, that's four representatives.  Who's abstaining ?  Who hasn't voted ?<br>
<br>
2.  The only guilds that I have seen post on our message board for membership are VC and IA.  They're the only guilds that I know of that have also joined us on raids.  I think there needs to be set dates posted that other guilds can see as to when we will be inviting others.  The way it sits now, VC and IA and whoever else applies has no timeframe.  To be honest, they've been more than patient now, as it has appeared that we have been ignoring them.  I'd like to see 2 guilds or 1 guild every 2 months.  Have a section where new guilds apply.  Our representatives vote on them, if there are 7 guilds in the queue, then they vote on the 7 guilds, giving them a value of 1-7, where 7 is the guild they want in the most.  You total up everyone's points, and the two guilds with the most points gets invited.  Two months later, we do the same thing.  This time the guilds that were on the waiting list start with a preset 5 points, and we do the process over again.  If for some reason 50% of the representatives deem that a guild should not be invited, then they should be informed of such immediately, and removed from the voting.  <br>
<br>
3.  I hear people saying that &quot;we're big enough&quot;.  When do we stop inviting people ?  My response to that is, why ?  The SGA is an alliance, it's not one big guild.  So what if we have 10 guilds in it ?  The WHOLE PREMISE behind the SGA was to allow smaller guilds accomplish things that they COULD NOT accomplish on their own.  It wasn't designed to be just big enough to do stuff on it's own.<br>
<br>
If the SGA is to become only so big then stop allowing other guilds to join, then the SGA has become exactly what I have attempted to avoid.  It will be no better than a larger guild that descriminates against classes and levels and size.  We'll be doing raids and not inviting friends.<br>
<br>
4.  People say we're inviting guilds too fast.  That they haven't gotten to know everyone else yet.  Do you know everyone in your own guild ?  I don't.  Does this stop me from treating them as friends when I see them ?  No.  Does this mean Amnesty is too big ?  No.  Have I met and made friends with a lot of new people because of SGA ?  Yes.  <br>
<br>
5.  Diadem will be getting his Epic here shortly.  I plan on setting up a raid to take out the General for this weekend.  That will push the total of Epics to two.  That's two more than I ever thought we would have by now.  Is there anyone else that thought the SGA would be so close to taking out VS or Trak at this point ?<br>
<br>
6.  Word has it that Hareq doesn't attend any raids that he doesn't lead.  Is this true ?  I think not.  Did I not go to Kael and help Malleolus ?  How about when I helped Holt on his KK raid ?  Zenknight's raid in Kithicor Forrest ?<br>
<br>
I think you're misinterpretting my intent.  The problem is if I attend a raid, then people expect me to lead it.  I don't want to lead every raid.  I want others to lead them as well.<br>
<br>
I forsee a time when Zenknight is leading a raid into Hate, and I'm helping lead several groups into Velks. Lab.  Across the world Boofa is leading a group to take out the Black Reavers.<br>
<br>
So far Krytog, Zenknight and Lingling have stepped up big time, and have led some very successful raids.  I applaud them on their hard work.  It is very difficult to lead a raid, and if you haven't tried, I suggest you do. <p>Hareq Ghoulslayer, 54 Paladin<br>

Hareq <br>
<br>
I don't thnk we have an issue with you comming on a raid and people thinking your going to lead. If that's keeping you from going to any of my raids then don't worry about it. Unless I know that you have more knowledge of a zone then I do your just a member of the team. Kith for me was different, I knew that your knowledge of that target was better then mine. So don't keep yourself from going because of that.<br>
<br>
The last fear raid worked like this. Holt had the idea. I initially lead the raid and got people there. I passed off the leadership mantel to Ling, Elektra and Henklin. They know the zone much better then I do, they know what needs to be done to break and pull. We shared the responsibilities and had a great raid.<br>
<br>
SO don't assume your going to mess something up by showing, being one of the highest level SGA tanks makes you valuable on all the raids.<br>

<br>
Not sure about the too BIG thing. It is possible to get too big in My opinion, but we should all discuss this. As a high level chanter I feel obligated to go on these high level raids, if there are four or five a week, there is no time for me to do the things I want to do. Will having more guilds in, mean more raids, mean that we are going to work our clerics and chanters to death?<br>

<br>
Hopefully adding more guilds also means more enchanters and clerics to fill the gap and give you guys more choice as to what raid you want to go to or to not go at all with no pressure. We currently have 4 planes level enchanters and 4 maybe 5 planes level clerics that I know of. We can always use more.<br>
<br>
<br>
Even as a warrior I feel your pain with this. I am constantly being asked to help with epics or raids or what ever and have little time anymore to level. In my case I need more envolvment from the other warriors to share the load. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We are building an organization that has met with great success in servicing the needs of our higher-level players.  <br>
<br>
I for one, do not believe that we are inviting guilds too fast.  Nor do i believe that the SGA is &quot;big enough already&quot;.  I have made a few attempts at leading small raids to various locations.  To date it has been difficult to get as many participants as i would like for the raids i have planned.  Recognizing that this is probably in part due to my inexperience with organizing raids, I would nonetheless probably have benefited from having a larger group of members to draw from.  <br>
<br>
I do believe that the SGA is a better organization because there is a stable core membership that communicates effectively across guild boundaries.  I know that the SGA is not a guild, but i still believe that it is a stronger, healthier organization because its members have developed friendships and enjoy spending time together.  I know that in my heart, i feel proud to be a member of the SGA, just as i feel proud to be a member of the Spirit Guardians.  I feel proud of what we have accomplished.  <br>
<br>
This pride and these friendships are important for the success of our raids and for the advancement of our members.  Please ask yourselves how much quicker you respond to calls for help from friend?  Ask yourselves how much closer you pay attention to the well-being of players you know and trust?  <br>
<br>
As Hareq points out, our successes (especially regarding epic quests) have come much more quickly than we originally imagined.  Certainly this success represents one indication of our readiness to move on with the growth of the SGA.  However, at the same time, this success should provide us the motivation to move forward in the right way, so as to guard against the loss of what we have already put together.  <br>
<br>
All things considered, IMHO it probably is the right time for the SGA to move forward.  But let's not put expansion ahead of the well-being of the existing alliance.<br>

In almost joining Familjen and being a member of Heaven and Earth for awhile I can tell everyone, without a doubt, there is always always a shortage of high level clerics and enchanters needed for the completion of epics and large scale raids.  Right now, almost every other day I am asked to help with someones epic (not entirely SGA, mostly friends from previous guilds).  If additional guilds are invited, without fully exploring their class makeup, the strain on the clerics and enchanters currently in SGA might greaten rather than lessen.  <br>
<br>
A couple raids a week is all I really care for, they aren't why I play.  I enjoy grouping with friends and exploring.<br>
With HaE, there were a minimum of three large raids a week, and during the offdays, I was either expected to gain experience so I could better help on future raids, or help people with their epics.  After six weeks, I was exhausted in RL and broke in EQ life from the constant expense of gems that never got reimbursed.<br>
<br>
In addition, epics are great, but seriously, I am not wild about helping every person get an epic, and I think a minimum level, maybe 55, should be set on when someone should be asking others in obtaining their epic.  Obviously some epics, such as the rez stick, are extremely important, and benefit the guild more than just an individual, but in my opinion, every person on the server shouldn't have an epic or it defeats the purpose.  I am definately not saying I won't help a person under level 55 with part of their epic, just saying it would be an exception and I am not going to make a habit of it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubamilbanebringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bamil Banebringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/1/01 5:14:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New Guilds</span><hr size=1> Hareq, thank you that is what I was looking for out of you.

<br>
Not sure where this is coming from. I talk to everyone and am at every event, and have never heard anything like this uttered. This is a ridicoulous assertion, you do more than your share for the SGA. On a side note: we are not Uber_guild_01, and do not require any attendance to any raid regardless of who you are. Raids are to be fun in the SGA, not a job.<br>
<br>
If you look back through the message board there have been no less than 8 posts regarding membership, not 2. I have personally spoken to officers in these guilds ingame, on msgboards, and through emails. I encourage everyone in the SGA to lookout for the good of the organization, this is your responsibility and it will further all of us by your commitment.<br>
<br>
As for leading raids you are right. It's a big job. I spent 13 straight hours Sunday in tell hell, dealing with every single issue that came up at both raids, and I wasn't the raid leader, so I can imagine. When I logged off I was physically and mentally drained, and I had 0 want to play. I have yet to log Bamil back on from that day, and probably won't until this weekend. Having an official title with some type of leadership stigma attached to it can be a big job. I thank the GL's and officers of our guilds for doing a tremendous job.<br>
<br>
Landy,<br>
<br>
I agree with everything you have said. This is my concern as well. Adding guilds and meeting new friends should be a great experience, however there are precautions to take. I like our organization to this point, and personally opt for a slow expansion rather than a constant influx of change. If we are going to do things we need to do them right.<br>
<br>
Anyhow... all that being said, you will be seeing a new member in the SGA shortly. I too think this is an exciting time for us all.<br>

<br>
I feel that we need to have not raids to gain loot, but instead scheduled raids to gain experience. Lets face it there are really only two things in this game that count and thats exp and loot. The rest is just emotional mumbo jumbo. So lets get some Icewell raids going and get some hole Raids going. I would personally like to see a new section on the message board for EXP-GROUPS. I sat last night in Karnors (that place is way to camped) and realized that I wasn't getting any exp here and that I wasn't around the people that I wanted to be around, namely the SGA members. So I logged off a very unsatisfied cleric. If we had a daily schedule just of people saying &quot;I am going to be at this place tonight getting exp, anyone want to join?&quot; then I wouldn't have been stuck in the dilema I was last night. <br>
<br>
Then again, perhaps that isn't the thing to do?<br>
I don't know the real solution of how to get with you guys, but I simply would like to group more with the SGA members. I am getting kind of burned out on this night after night of thrown together groups.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if the SGA was expanded to more guilds then there could be more of these exp hunts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bsaryrnguildallianceboard>saryrnguildallianceboard</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.entercasino.com/main.cgi?refererID=502600>What's your game?
