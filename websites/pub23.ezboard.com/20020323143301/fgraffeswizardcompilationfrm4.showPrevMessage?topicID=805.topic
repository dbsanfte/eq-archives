<br>
A little background:  I have generally been solo for the last 30 levels because I have very little time to play EQ and the patience to be /lfg for more than 10 minutes.  So a big item loot for me would be a gem in CS or maybe RyGorr stuff a few levels ago.  Unlike a drood I can’t track, so coming across a named in outdoor zones is a rare accident, usually when I’m already oom or running for my life.<br>
<br>
Last night in Sebilis was my first time there.  Got a great group with the help of my new guildmates and we went to what I understood was the disco room.  We were there a total of three and a half hours.  The cleric was ML-ing.  Now everyone was great at their job, chanter cleric me, a great wiz friend and two kickass SKs.  Fun night and almost two blues.  No complaints there.<br>
<br>
The item drops were about 8 spells (Gift of Zev, Cripple, Splurt, Yaulp IV and a few others I can’t remember), about 12 gems, 2 seb scale mantles, a Slime Covered Harpoon and a Donal’s Vambs.   Bear in mind the cleric already had Donal’s and one of the SKs, a level 58, said he’s always in Seb and therefore he was “out” on items aside from the 300 plat split.   Fair enough.<br>
<br>
Now I’m stupid, but I figured we’d roll on everything, Donal’s on down and folks winning something would have the courtesy to bow out of the next rolls.   Seems to me there was an item there for everyone except one person.  I’d have probably donated the gems to the cleric no matter what and given the spells (aside from need) to the one person who didn’t get an item - -  and we’d all be on our way.  <br>
<br>
That’s when the cleric does the following: Autosplits the plat (fair enough) gives me two gems, and one of the two seb mantles (the other going to one of the casters, I think).  She decides to give the Donal’s to one of the SK’s (a guildmate and great person), keeps the spear and God knows what happened to the spells.   <br>
<br>
Now don’t get me wrong, I’ll live.  But what ticks me off is the following 1) Just random stuff.  It takes only a few seconds and to tell you the truth, win or lose, it’s always one of the most rewarding parts of any good night dungeoneering.  When in doubt and particularly with people you don’t know, just random.   It’s a good policy that no one can argue with.  2) There is this blasé attitude on the part of some players, particularly those for whom grouping is never a challenge (sorry but it’s often chanters/clerics) which goes something like “Oh well whatever, it’s all junk anyway.”   Well pardon me, it’s not junk to me.   You’ll be back tomorrow night, I might not get in a quality Seb group for another few months.    It takes me several months to generate 7kpp in the bank from tailoring, porting and sharp trading.  Last time I checked no one was giving out resist gear.   On my server a seb mantle goes for 200-300pp, a harpoon +500pp and Donal’s nearer 1kpp (or more).  3) Lastly, and I can’t prove this one by last night, but I get the odd feeling sometimes that wizzies sometimes get overlooked on random loots because we aren’t Holy Trinity.    Like loot distribution is icing on the cake for us, I mean “Hey, just letting you group is reward enough” or the ever popular “You could always quad.”  Let me tell those few of you reading here who never have quadded, it ain’t that easy.  It also ain’t that lucrative.   <br>
<br>
I could as easily have lost every random and ended up with plat a few gems and some spells.  But I would have been happier.   I don’t think the way it was done was meant to disadvantage people, but when I ML, I feel that I’m just holding the stuff for the group.  Not that I should get creative cause I’m in a rush to log or because it’s all junk to me.  I believe in need before greed, but after that pretty much anything worth more than 50pp may be junk to you but I’m not that rich.  <br>

I personally much prefer the ML system as it is the only way i get loot because i am always medding.  I also am gifted with a tight knit guild group of trustworthy friends, and it is usually the guy in the chair behind me doing the ML.  (confuses people cause when he loots something he makes me type the stats while he reads them out to me hehe)  So there is always a fair split and we generally do a random to see who gets first pick and let each person pick what they want in the order determined by the dice, with extra spells going to the guildbank usually.  Unfortunately, strangers are often not so trustworthy ( <p>Luxum Aeturnum - Delharen D'Oloth <BR>

<br>
Before you think I agree with you, most guild based groups do Need before Greed (TM).  It's up to the guild leaders on how they want things handled.  In my guild, the leaders said that it is up to each group how they want to distribute loot.  But as a rule if someone has any interest in an item OTHER than to sell it, they should get that item.  If nobody needs an item then it gets rolled on by the people who haven't gotten anything yet.  Spells always go to the guild bank (not a 'rule').  If the group is in a very selfless mood, items nobody wants may go to other guildmembers or to the guild bank.<br>
<br>
Yeah it was kind of crappy that the cleric didn't say why they distributed the loot that way, but before getting upset about it you should ASK ABOUT IT!<br>
<br>
Of course, this only applies if the group consisted of mostly guild members.  You only said that guildmates helped you get into the group.  If the cleric wasn't in your guild, then keep on ranting. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12366>Galuvian Silvertone</a><br>

Fair enough question...<br>
<br>
I'm new to guild so I really don't know what the guild rules are.  Only three of the six groupmembers were in my guild, and not the ML cleric, so I don't think this was a &quot;guild group.&quot;   If the ML strategy described above were the guild rules, I wouldn't stay in the guild long.  I'd also have no right to complain though, as it would be up to me to know my guild's loot policy.<br>
<br>
The few times I've been in pickup groups I usually dispense with all the guild loot rule horsecrap.  If it's an all-guild group, fine, rules are rules.  If someone non-guild joins, I think all that stuff goes out the window and the group decides what is fair.  Even when 50% of the group is my guild.  This isn't rocket science as to how to be fair. <br>
<br>
ML is fine.  Just random everything that isn't needed.  I agree with Whiz that it's probably best to know rules going in, to avoid trouble later.   My group skills are rusty and I should have been clearer.  It's just that ML usually means (to me) one person loots.  ML doesn't have anything to do with distribution.   The group should decide or if no one is fired up about it /random is your friend <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for the &quot;it isn't worth looting (insert item name_001)&quot; comment.  Whatever.  That was the whole point of my post - it's your prerogative to feel that way but I don't feel embarrased to say it is important to me.  <br>
<br>
Some folks really don't care about such loot cause they have a steady loot stream from grouping/raiding (I say great for them!).  Still others wish to perpetuate the notion that they are &quot;above&quot; common looting cause they are &quot;uber&quot; (/yawn). These are basically people from category one with a touch of insecurity imho.   Again, whatever.  I'm not too proud to admit I expect to random treasure after risking my neck just as much as everyone else, and a few hundred plat to me is important.  Forget the items if it makes you feel better.  Let's assume we replace each item with it's relative value.  It was like seeing someone say &quot;1kpp to you, 300pp to you and you, I'll take 500pp and Oh, can I get a TL?&quot;<br>
<br>
Everyone has a different level of tolerance for what others perceive as &quot;beneath them.&quot;   Me for instance, I'd rather be in an xp group for three hours and get a shot at a Donal's to sell or give to my twink.  I'm prepared tell people it's important to me and I'm prepared to walk away empty-handed.   <br>
<br>
Others want to be all tricked out in the best gear an uber guild can offer, and are willing to be guild gimps to get it.  I feel that's beneath me, so I solo alot.  See that's what makes horseraces.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Gnomish Advocate</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/5/02 11:24:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=806.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/flappy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Master Loot Jerks</span><hr size=1> Ah, I misunderstood.<br>
