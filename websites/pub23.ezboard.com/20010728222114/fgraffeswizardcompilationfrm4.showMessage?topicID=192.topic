He always gives answers that don't even apply to the questions.  Most recently:<br>
<br>
3. Casters are totally mana dependant, melees are not totally attack speed dependant (their HP/AC is as useful as their damage output in tank cases) <br>
<br>
                      Not true. Casters are just as AC and HP dependent as<br>
                      anyone else. It's just that their hit points come in the form<br>
                      of melee classes and pets, in much the same way that<br>
                      melee characters draw their hit points from healers and<br>
                      their speed from casters. <br>
<br>
Umm....WTF?<br>
<br>
How do tanks being able to tank for us make us less mana dependant?<br>

Rangers were pretty screwed for a long time, most of us KNEW that, the same with Hybrids, but most of us just didn't FEEL insulted and angry about it because our main was a wizard, and we are getting screwed in different ways.<br>
<br>
We are focused on wizard problems because we play wizards, other people are focused on the problems of other classes.  Absor has never played a wizard SERIOUSLY, so can't understand when we complain.  No one can really understand us if they've never made a focused effort on playing a wizard daily, from level 1 through their mid 50s or to 60.  Until they try it(and not just boosting levels to see how it is), they will always be detached.<br>

I am thinking that in an open forum, live, where things like Vocal tone, volume, presence, facial expressions, etc come into play, he seems to at LEAST be able to control the attention of the people.  Even if it IS bs.  All of those qualities that you just mentioned about Abashi... Absor STILL acts like that even in front of the people who line his pockets.  It is more a comparison of the lesser of two evils.  Neither should be praised that much for putting together something that 90 percent of the programmers who play the game could do as well.  But I am not living my life as a programmer.  It is a side line.  So I will never waltz around with the &quot;I know everything&quot; attitude.<br>
<br>
And there is no reason to insult the opinion.  The facts are the facts.  Did I say he was straight foward all the time?  Or even REMOTELY all the time?  No.  But my memory of what I asked and what he answered is fine.  Please respect that like I respect your opinions.  Fine, you disagree, but is the remark necessary?<br>

Many many people get Absor and Abashi confused, the names are... well kinda similar.  I was commenting on what he said about Abashi, which I found amazingly incorrect.  I don't know Abashi in person, I think I know what kind of person he is, but its unfair to judge without having the experience.<br>
<br>
But the fact remains: the only exposure we have to the guy leaves everyone with a horrid taste in their mouth.<br>
