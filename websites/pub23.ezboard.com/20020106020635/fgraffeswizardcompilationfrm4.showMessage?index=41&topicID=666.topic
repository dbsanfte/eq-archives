 rombus: is a thread locking nazi who twists words and selectively ignores statements, and then locks/deletes that which he cannot argue.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
First off, I am not a member of the Nazi party nor do I have any Nazi-like qualities. I'm sick of being refered to in as a Nazi in any sense of the word. To those refering to me as a Nazi - I point a middle finger in your general direction. Grow up, please.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I locked 2 threads. One because of the MASSIVE emails I recieved requesting I do so (34 and counting...). The other one (which you brought on yourself) was locked because you avoided the locked topic and tried to start a new one on the same subject.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->im not stupid, i knew there was no way in hell that topic was going to last more than 5 seconds. i had hoped people would see it long enough for me to have a fair chance at responding to some of the responses in the locked one.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
SAYS WHO?<br>
<br>
here is a sample of your many quotes:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I don't even know why I'm bothering arguing with you. It's obvious your vision for Mages is to surpass Wizards (not to mention every other class in the game) and you can't accept the fact that you are a pet caster and a utility class, not to mention NOT a first class nuker. Hell, you're complaining because you can outdamage a Monk and Warrior but not a Rogue... who is really the one spewing the complete BS here?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
my vision is for mages to surpass wizards? in over all damage, YOU BET and only those ignorant of the game will disagree w/ me. <br>
mages (since you have a problem understanding me, when i say &quot;mages&quot; in this sense, i mean nukes, ds, and pet all as one) SHOULD be doing more &quot;total&quot; or &quot;long term&quot; or &quot;over all&quot; damage than a wizard, that is a fact. there is no reason to play a mage if a wizard can kill faster AND do more damage over all AND have more utility than a mage.<br>
<br>
oh and...UTILITY CLASS W/ A PET? wtf? <br>
is anyone reading this? please raise your hand if you think a mage is a utility class with a pet. <br>
maybe people who spend their time w/ a pathetic guild coth whore who throws their mana on the ground for useful people to use after they are done summoning the working classes somewhere might think that. but guess what? the eq mage is supposed to be MORE than that. <br>
throwing mana on the ground does not complete a class. summoning useful people somewhere does not complete a class. <br>
<br>
mages are an offensive class w/ 2 or 3 utility spells.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

translation:<br>
perhaps if you said nothing which was against popular opinion, more specifically MY OPINION, or at least didnt say it too loudly you might not have gotten the reactions you did. <br>
flocks of mindless lemmings who, like dogs, viciously attack anyone who may oppose you are an earned privilege, not a given right...remember that.<br>

 -asking for an upgrade to mage nukes isnt asking to nuke as well as a wizard. even more so when the mage in question REPEATEDLY says they do not want to nuke as well as a wizard, and never once directly said they wanted to nuke as well as a wizard.<br>
<br>
-asking for an upgrade to my pet isnt asking for a pet as good as an equal level melee. even more so when the mage in question REPEATEDLY says they do not want a pet as strong as a melee, and never once directly said they wanted a pet as strong as a melee.<br>
<br>
-mages SHOULD have far better long term damage than wizards. an overwhelming portion of my damage is &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;long term&quot;. wizard damage is purely fast. fast damage should NEVER be as &quot;large over all&quot; as slow damage, else slow damage is USELESS. furthermore, argueably only a ROGUE is more pure offense than a mage.<br>

Welcome to Graffe's WIZARD Compilation. In case you didn't notice this is a Wizard board and not the place to bring up Mage balance issues because frankly, we could care less.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
ugh... and ugh again.<br>
<br>
i never wanted to debate mage class balance here. was that thread called &quot;bitching about how mages suck&quot;? no it wasnt.<br>
<br>
i was dragged into it when i gave an example of mages as one of the classes who the system of &quot;progress and you are rewarded with power&quot; doesnt work for. <br>
