<br>
Second; we need to give the raid leader the benefit of the doubt. It is a very hard job to do. Sometimes it is not obvious why the raid leader is doing something, and we better be well informed before we blast him for his decisions. (Obviously I am at fault for doing this before, sorry)<br>
<br>
Third; I am a little concerned about the attitude &quot;SGA only.&quot; For instant on planes raids I think we should allow friends to attend, but that friend should have a sponsor who will be held responsible for their friends behavior. One person can kill everyone on a planes raid; so we need to be picky about who joins the raids. We also need some sort of rule about joining in the middle of a raid. Purely equipment raids like the GEBs raid are different. Everyone in such a raid should know and be reminded that the raid is to get an SGA member a certain item or items. Most high level people are aware of such things, but reminders help prevent hard feelings.<br>
<br>
Fourth; the raid leader cant do everything. It think we all should make sure the group we are in knows what is going on. For instance, after the raid leader explains how we are attacking hate, someone in out group should say; &quot;so we all camo up, zone in when BEN says GO, and then run straight in until we see fire wall and then head to the zone wall just to the left of the fire wall?&quot;  &quot; and if we get attacked we run a little to the left and die?&quot; (or whatever the instructions were) Then make sure our group members all respond; yes! I believe it is the responsibility of everyone in a group to make sure their group knows what is up.  So we if move, everyone in the group should be saying; &quot;were moving guys, follow Hareq to the east.&quot;  And when someone new joins a group make sure they know the loot rules. In the case that started this thread I think the members of the raid let Zenknight down a bit by not explaining the loot rules to tht druid; although I guess from what Cicotte said there was not really much time to explain.<br>

Which means, NOT just everyone who felt like showing up that so and so day can join us, provided that we are not lacking the key classes(Cleric, chanter) of course.  I don't see why SGA has to host a so called &quot;completely open raid&quot;.  It's a ridiculous notion.  Since when did any raid composed of 40+ people organized?  Since when did any raid composed of 40+ people considered fair?  <br>
<br>
Has people forgotten that certain PoF raid when people started to show up 4 hours into the raid just for loot and when Arch FDed and ninjaed that Umbral BP while everyone else went down fighting?  Loot, like it or not, is an aspect of the game.  How many SGA members you know will show up raid after raid if non-SGA members keep getting lucky and winning all the good items?  Hypothetically speaking, if you have 20 SGA member and 10 non-SGA members present at a raid, and the 10 non-SGA members end up winning 3/4 of the loot due to lucky rolls, how is that considered to be &quot;taking care of our own&quot;?  <br>
<br>
Yeah I know some of you may think that I'm getting close to the &quot;uber guild mentality&quot; but you know what, these are all perfectly valid points.  SGA, like any other guild entity, should exist to benefit its member.  Diplomacy and good relations with others is important but it shouldn't come at the expense of SGA members.  While &quot;SGA only raids&quot; may not be the thing for us to do, &quot;invite only raids&quot; should be.  After all, we have been, and always will invite those players who are friends of SGA to the raids.  <br>
<br>
One last item.  Everyone who have been to their share of large raids should know by now that &quot;open raids&quot; are;<br>
<br>
1. A good deal of the time, they are unorganized and end in disaster.<br>
2. Shady characters tend to show up and end up ruining the experience for others.<br>
3. Too many chiefs, not enough indians.<br>
4. Loot rules are rarely *acceptable* to everyone participating and of course, lots of complaints.<br>
<br>
These are the perfect arguements why NOT to have completely open raids.</font><P><P><i><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utelivaksk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TelivakSK</A> at: 4/17/01 7:47:18 am</FONT><br></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#6A74B4><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uholtthecleric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Holt the Cleric</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Registered User</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>4/17/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#FFFF00>9:23:51 am</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=17><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Reply</FONT></A></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Large scale raids</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">After reading all these post I am getting quite worried about the stability of our Alliances. It is seeming that we are no longer friends grouping to achieve a common goal, but instead we are reaching the mentality of the uber guilds. I personally will not be a part of such a thing. I have played this game since beta and have seen SO many guilds disolve. It seems that everytime a guild or alliance fades it doesn't explode but instead implodes in on itself. I am sorry to see that the heads of the Alliance are in dispute here and that they cannot stand together in one common agreement as to the looting policy and the simple playing nice rules. I feel that I am standing on a hill watching an empire crumble under its own disputes. Please let us put this minor thing behind us and move on and become even a stronger Alliance. <br>
<br>
On a side note:<br>
I agree with hareq about the cookie cutter responses from other guilds wanting to join the SGA. simple fact is we could use more people to some of the larger scale raids such as the planes.<br>

Open dragon raids are different because old world dragons are relatively easy and is at most, a 3 hour encounter with maybe an hour of actual fighting involved.  When I go on a long, drawn out, large scale raid, I would like to go with people I trust and can depend on.  That's the common ground between all guilds, large and small. <br>
<br>
You shouldn't have to tell people the simpliest of instructions like mezz/root the adds, mana pump the healers.. etc, during these raids.  They should know it already.  That's the problem with completely open raids, so many people show up whom you've never seen or played with before.  You don't know if they know their class.  You don't know if they're capable of dealing with the pressure.  Even more so, and I've seen this many times, some people just don't contribute.  Some players just sit around and don't offer any useful assistance to the raid, while just simply expecting to get to roll on loots.<br>
<br>
Sorry, I will no longer participate in any un-moderated, &quot;completely open&quot; plane raids because the probability of that raid succeeding is 50/50 at best with the new changes to planes in place.  I certainly do not feeling like going on a 6+ hour CR.  Just look at the past few open plane raids.

Since that time and having nothing to do with that incident that loot rule has been altered to support pick up raids. <br>
<br>
My anger was at the initial post and the facts as laid out to Hareq by his friend. That's all.<br>
<br>
As far as inviting people to events, the first planes raid we went on together was a pickup raid that I started and invited SG to. Hence the begining of a very nice relationship between SF and SG. I have to agree with Telivak that we should not hold completely open raids. Having done a few just as some of you have it's almost not worth the trouble and angst  to run them. My belief is that friends are always welcome and hell if we go to hate with no bard and bard armor is dropping I'm not opposed to getting one up there from where ever to get the drops so they don't rot.<br>
<br>
Another point is that we should be more concerned with the well fare of our SGA brothers and sisters then joe blow walking antonica. I can't believe that anyone would disagree with this. Should we exclued friends from raids no should we have open raids where groups of people we don't know come un invited, defintely not!  <br>
<br>
Why is this considered a uber guild mentality? All that go on a raid roll on loot or get loot if they need it SGA or not. If the notion that we want to take care of our own first and have managable raids is so against the lofty ideals of the SGA and forces people to leave that's just silly and not why I worked to get SF to join. This is a mutually beneficial alliance where we help each and go on raids together.<br>
<br>
How are we supposed to get all of this outside envolvement if we don't post our raids publicly which for the most part we don't. With fear people just showed up. Hate on the other hand is nice it takes to much organization and money to just zone in. So what do we do in fear when straglers we don't know just decide to show up, they zone in and run training an unsuspecting camp or worse yet run somewhere else and die then expect a CR. Is it our responsibility to allow these people to then roll on loot after they caused a group of 36 people delays or caused a whipeout? I say no! do we help them CR sure once where they died is cleared.<br>
<br>
Sure we can always take a few others with us but completely open raids are not what I thought this organization was about.<br>
<br>
As far as the cookie cutter responses the organizational stuff is still trying to be ironed out. I personally talked to the Daywalkers GL (after alot of bad timing tries for me) and explained that we need to have them come on some raids so that we can all get know each other. I think that should be first before we invite a guild in. Let's work together first and make sure we are all happy with the arrangment before tying the knot. That's what SF did before joining and I don't see a flaw with that philosophy. I do think we are in a postion now to invite Issuo in and Daywalkers after a few raids. <br>
