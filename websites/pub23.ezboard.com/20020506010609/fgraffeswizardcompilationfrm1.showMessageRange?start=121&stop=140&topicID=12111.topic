For content and variety, I don't see another game that comes close to EQ, and really don't know what you expect.  Do you want to kill mobs without nuking?  Maybe by running a Super Mario-style maze while nuking?<br>
<br>
It just sounds like a malcontent attitude:  there are things out there to do and challenges that haven't been met, while you kill mobs you have killed 100 times with twice as many people as you need.   On top of it all, we have a new expansion to keep us going, and still you complain about nothing new.   <br>
<br>
Just because some of you are proud and feel you have mastered the basics of raiding, lets see how well you do when you ARE challenged:  by lack of players maybe, LD, new mobs that you haven't seen and already discount...<br>

Yes, you can say EQ doesn't require strategy, but saying so because you have limited options doesn't necessarily back your argument one way or the other. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

<br>
Whiz, now you are being deliberately misleading, you know damned well what I meant by that, unless you stopped reading at that sentence. Just in case you DID stop reading at that sentence, and didn't read a single post counter to your rather interesting opinion I will restate.<br>
<br>
How 'strategic' is it to regurgitate the same tactic slightly varied over and over? You may call this strategy. But I call it tweaking. Yes, techinically, as Rombus stated one strategy is indeed still a strategy, but Dmitri is also accurate when he says it is more like execution than strategy. Certainly it is not iteresting.<br>
<br>
Gee, VS without a Cleric.. HOW CLEVER we will rune instead of CH.<br>
<br>
What resists does the mob have? Is it one that won't summon? How do I isolate it? Can it be nuked from out of melee range? What ae does it have? What kind of aggro does it have? How does it spawn? What happens when it despawns?<br>
<br>
Answer me those questions and I will craft a piece of genious strategy to defeat it that WILL work if there is discipline and sufficient numbers.<br>
<br>
And it will smell a lot like the Bethude Strategy.<br>
<br>
&quot;You asked me to give examples of my strats, that is asking for proof, is it not?&quot;<br>
<br>
Well certainly it would... except that I never did in fact ask that<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I don't see that is profitable to ask for an FTL drive for my car are cute little dancing fairies on top of my monitor either. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I assert that the 'strategies' are all variations on the Bethude Strategy. I do not diminish the variations. But the fact of the matter is it is the same theory used over and over tweaked a little bit. What dd to use and how soon? Can we do one tank or need several to hand off aggro? What debuffs are worth attampting? Is he a caster? Will he CH? Can he be pushed? Can he be stunned? (almost always not)<br>
<br>
Alas I can't ever invent the Bethude Strategy because Bethude already invented it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Bethude missed no point, his post's point was that people who say there is only one strategy have most likely not tried to do it a different way.&quot; - FK<br>
<br>
Rombus, wrong wrong wrong. Apprently you like to think everyone else are morons and sheep like Bethude does, but people DO try all sorts of things AND DIE<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The reason why everyone uses the Bethude Strategy is that it WORKS. This is evolution in action. Do something else, and die.<br>
<br>
Again I just think it wouild be nice if a little more cleverness were involved. A little variety. Some mobs that were not so melee centric.<br>
<br>
For the record I DON'T want to know your super secret 007 strategies. ONE they would show me wrong <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and TWO I don't think they exist.<br>
<br>
I know of a small handful of mobs that through various tricks can be handled with a minimum of people. I can only assume many people do. If those are the sort of 'strategies' you are talking about, that only work in a small handful of situations, then you are just making my point for me.<br>
<br>
The reason you don't want the information to get out, is because WE ALL KNOW that if VI gets wind of it they WILL NERF IT.<br>
<br>
Only raids using the Bethude Strategy are welcome in EQ. The rest of you will be found out and the nerf bat used sans lube until you submit.<br>

It is quite different than the MT/CH strategy, and was ingenious. I first observed it before I joined the guild, and it also differed from the more common conventional strategy I saw posted on this board, among others.<br>
<br>
As for the question of whether there is strategy in the game: of course there is. However, by far the majority of game play revolves around execution of strategy rather than derivation of strategy. I think that one of the main reasons there is so much dissent on this thread is that from a Wizard's perspective, there's not a lot of difference. We really have only 3 questions that need to be answered: <br>
1) When to nuke (usually 80%)<br>
2) Which nuke to use (varies)<br>
3) How best to manage agro between nukes (pacing, mob distance, etc)<br>
These same three questions need to be answered independent of the main strategy, and usually the answer is the same (there's not a lot of opportunity for creative play here). I can't think of a mob where the strat revolves around Wizard's getting agro (or if I did, I couldn't share it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )...<br>
<br>
Finally, I do believe that the game discourages creative play. As the Conquest incident demonstrated, thinking too far out of the box has dire consequences, which is imho very bad for the game. We backed off on one Ventani strat because our guild leader at the time thought it might be construed as an exploit... now that's messed up.<br>
<br>
Oh, and speaking of Ventani... there's a mob that Triton off'ed without using the conventional MT/CH strat. We used that basic strategy for the rest of ST, but failed against Ventani several times with the conventional approach before trying something different and freeing the sleeper. Even Triton tends to start with MT/CH strat first for new encounters. Let's be honest: it's the best strat at least half the time.<br>
<br>
... but it's not the only strat.<br>

<br>
There is definately strategies to use against different mobs, but once you know what strategy to use, you really don't have to think beyond that point.<br>
<br>
Yes, warriors and clerics are a key component to a LOT of raids, but you know what? They HAVE to be. They're 2 of the most boring classes in the game to play, and if they weren't needed for so much, there aren't many people that would bother playing them. Complete healing a single tank is pretty much the safest way through any encounter (the simplest strategy tends to be the safest since it's hard to fuck up ^_^)<br>
<br>
That doesn't make it the 'only way to do things'<br>
<br>
If I want, I could take a team of 50 manaburning wizards and own any mob in the game with  &lt; 500k hps (hell you could even do million hp mobs with that set up if you got lucky enough with your crits).<br>

I have yet to see any other strategies thrown up because guilds are afraid of people &quot;stealing their strategy.&quot; For the love of Ro... a guild is going to figure out your &quot;strategy&quot; or make their own eventually and kill the mob. You aren't doing jack by keeping your strategies a secert.<br>

TELL ME a different strategy. Show me! Lay it out so that even someone with my IQ can see the HUGE difference between MT-CH &quot;strategy&quot; and that one.<br>

Grimstaff: We've been over this before. Guilds do not release their strategies because of many reasons, foremost being competition in the high-end game. Every spawn is contested, and if you go around yelling about how you kill something, you will see less and less of that spawn. Another reason is time input into developing it.

Not much of an argument. You want to classify stuff as the same, so you find some way to fit it, and then declare it is the same. So any encounter where you have someone tanking (could be the enchanter) and he got heals (from the druid) falls under this idea.<br>
<br>
At its root, the main strategy in EQ is keep enough people alive so that the mob dies before everyone else does. Everyone guild I know uses this strategy. It is even more basic than one you mention in fact. And it has almost as much relevance too. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4380>Qaman</a><BR>

Alternatively, they are real, but are kept secret because as we all know anything that is NOT the Bethude Strategy is by definition an 'exploit'. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  In which case the secrecy is warranted, but merely proves my point:<br>

Classifying a bumble bee and a butterfly as insects can be done. Why? Sure, they are completely different specises, but they both maintain the same basic charactistics of an insect. Even if you have an enchanter tanking and being healed by druids does fall under the same idea.

Um, yes, they are. They're keeping everyone else from competing with them for the spawns. Competition, especially for really good stuff, and especially when you're facing someone on a more advantageous time zone or with more people period, is a Bad Thing.<br>
<br>
It would be idiotic of them to share this information, which is why, even though Apokk thinks their VS strat doesn't have to be kept secret any more, he didn't share it: It could well be used somewhere else (maybe where Triton didn't think to try it) and suddenly Triton would have two dozen more guilds competing with them for areas.<br>
