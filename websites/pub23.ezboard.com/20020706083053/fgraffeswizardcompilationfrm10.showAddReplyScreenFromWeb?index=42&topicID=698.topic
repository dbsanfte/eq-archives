<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If mages and wizards are both fast burn classes, and mages do more long-term, I don't really see much point to adding a wizard to a group. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Sure, there is a point to adding a wizard to the group.  Teleport, evac, snare, stuns, roots.  There's more to the game than damage, my friend.  Even so, don't foget that I stated clearly that I don't have a problem with wizards doing as much damage over a long period of time as a magician.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> First off, the very point of fast burn, has been pretty much broken down. As Grim mentioned, you need 4-5 casts to even see a difference in fast casting. If you chain-nuke like that, 1 of 2 things (or both things) will likely happen. You will get aggro and get pounded on, and/or you will be OOM really quick.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Nukes alone, wizards will do faster damage than a magician.  Aggro is a concern, however, at this level root and snare can prevent aggro from being a problem(for either class, wizard or magician).  Also, it does not take 4-5 casts to make a difference.  There is a difference <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> every single cast</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  It just takes 4-5 casts for the difference to become obvious enough for just about anyone to be able to see.  However, the point is moot, because if you're trying to compare fast damage between wizards and mages you're always going to have trouble because, as I stated, both classes excel at fast damage.  <br>
<br>
As for fast damage being worthless, that hasn't been proved true by any stretch of the imagination.  Convincing examples have been shown in specific high level situations, but not at all levels.  Situations where the maximum attainable spell DPS is around 150-175(and that's stretching it a bit) and the max melee dps is 80-120 or so.  At level 34 melee dps is probably between 10 and 15, while spell dps can easily get into the 40s and 50s.  Nukers can do 3 to 4 times as much damage as a melee over a short period of time at this lower level.<br>
<br>
The value of fast damage is debatable, as enchanter mez usually minimizes the need for it, however fast damage can make a lot of difficult situations easy, particularly if you're spending your 30s in Guk rather than Overthere.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Wizards are a nuking classs, it is all we have to do damage with. If we are not, and I actually believe this, the most damaging class in the game, then thier really is little argument for taking us over another class that does MORE damage but also has defensive skills. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Magicians do not have many defensive skills either.  From a magician point of view, wizards have more useful defensive abilities, such as snare, root, and the skin spells.  From a wizard point of view, pets are better defense than any of those things.<br>
<br>
My view is that the defensive abilities balance out.  If, indeed, pets are more useful for defense, they have their own drawbacks and it's really hard to make a direct comparison.  Until one side shows convincing evidence one way or the other, I'll continue to believe that niether class has a significant advantage overall when it comes to secondary abilities.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Mages have a pet. Warriors, rogues, rangers and monks all have more AC and skills, if needed, to avoid aggro. More than any other offensice class, the wizard totally and completely sacrifices defense. The reward for that should be terrifying, and unparralled. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Wizards have skins, snare, root, concussion, some stuns, and group evacuates as defensive abilities.  Magicians have none of those.  Instead, they have a pet.  Do not try to compare them unless you really feel you are capable of an unbiased comparison and have data to back it up.  Since I do not admit the ability to compare them fully, I will instead rule them out completely and consider them balanced until someone proves otherwise.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But [the reward for defensive sacrifice] isnt [unparallelled], furthermore there are many who apparently think it should be. If we are to keep finishing somewhere in the middle of the pack of damage dealers, there is simply no argument for this class to exist, except as TLers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I have quite a few problems with this statement.<br>
<br>
First, I have already disagreed that wizards sacrifice enough defense so as to be useless beyond nukes, at least when compared to magicians, so the foundation for this statement is weak in my eyes.<br>
<br>
Second, you claim to finish in the middle of the pack of damage dealers.  This vague statement is easily proved false.  All one would need is a log of a Luclin boss encounter.  In most any given fight at most levels, a wizard stands a very good chance of being the highest damage dealer, should he choose to be.  It is not until you get into a steady fighting situation where the only object is to kill as many mobs over a long period of time that wizard <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> damage</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> finishes in the middle of the pack, and even in those situations sometimes an ability like snare is more valuable than damage.<br>
<br>
Finally, a wizard is more than just single target nukes and translocates.  Aside from the aforementioned snare ability, which, though acquired somewhat late in the life of a wizard(29), is a very valuable ability, wizards have several different categories of AE spells.  Also, there are really two nuking classes in the game that are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pet dependant.  Wizards and Druids.  Since we are comparing wizards and mages, we must realize that Magicians are pet dependant.  If a magician cannot use his pet, then it will take a whole lot of damage shields to catch up to wizards.  For many people, the responsibility of a pet is not something they want to deal with.  If you're looking for a reason to have both wizards and magicians in the game, there is your answer.  Not everyone wants to be dependant on a pet, and not everyone wants to deal with the hassle of controlling one.  <br>
<br>
If long term damage really mattered as much as you claim, that is that the wizard class is useless because magicians are in the game, then why do wizards outnumber magicians?  <br>
<br>
Rhetorical question.  Just think about it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fast-burn, as a concept, is situational and certainly not needed in a group. If you plan to take away even that, then you remove the final, though creaky, argument for even having a wizard around.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'm talking about <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>ONE</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> class here, and that is magicians.  The ability to do fast damage is something that these two classes share.  One out of fourteen other classes that can equal your fast burn damage output doesn't invalidate wizards.<br>
<br>
When discussing balance, one must be very careful not to let ones personal bias and perspective cloud things to the point that by &quot;I want balance&quot; one really means &quot;I want to be the most powerful.&quot;  Fynal, you basically downplayed several wizard strengths and unique aspects of the class, and used a blanket comparison against all classes when, in fact, I was only talking about magicians.  When you do that, you're really not making a case for wizard balance versus a magician, you're making a case for wizard power versus everyone, and I don't think that was your intent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufynalwiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fynalwiz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/10/02 12:01:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=698.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages.... &lt;glare&gt;</span><hr size=1> &quot;Fynal, you basically downplayed several wizard strengths and unique aspects of the class, and used a blanket comparison against all classes when, in fact, I was only talking about magicians.

<br>
Re-reading your post and re-reading mine I see your part of your point. You are correct about snares and evacs (especially the recent addition) and thier utility in the group. I can also concede that it is very hard to make a concrete comparison about who has greater defensive skill.<br>
<br>
I still disagree about the fast damage thing. I think it's very situational, and quite frankly, I cant remember the last time I had to burn down a mob. As you mentioned there's usually someone CCing in the group, and if it gets beyond thier capabilities I am likely to evac--not burn them down.<br>
<br>
I am highlighting this because, this is what people say the wizard class is about--fast damage. That is the big difference between us and other damage dealers, allegedly. But aggro pretty much negates this as possible. Root and snare (especiallly root) are very unreliable means of controlling aggro should the situation arise that you need to.<br>
<br>
The situation you listed for damage is a raid encounter, I am assuming. Wizards certainly excel here. Unfortunately, there are many of us who still spend much of our time xping. When I am fighting in seb, karnors, or chardok, I am always toward the back when it comes to dealing damage over a long session.<br>
<br>
As for the diversity of spells you list, I use almost none of them in xping situations or on raids. Up to 52, I almost never used a rain a spell, even on single targets. Pillars and columns, I only used when soloing. PBAOEs, I almost never used. Half our arsenal is made up of AOEs, which have little relevance to the game for much of our career.<br>
<br>
For us, it always comes back to direct damage. This is our staple, our bread and butter. You take direct damage from a wizard, and you have a very gimped class. And yet for so much of our career, our DDs are well rivaled by other classes in the game. That is depressing. The minor advantages in mana and speed, just dont cut it. They arent enough to make us the true specialists we are supposed to be.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I get your point about over-exxagerating and downplaying. It was a bit of an emotional reaction to a statemtent about the most important things we have to offer. <br>

in terms of damage over time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
mages can short burn but it REALLY eats out mana, which is cool <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Personally I think that ALL casters need at least a +10% increase in nuke power. <br>
<br>
Wizzies +40% (mana ratios and damage output)  think thats nuts consider high end damage out put from melee. Whether by focus items or spell adjustments...  *shrug*<br>
A spell that casues non-energy damage, resists is by AC/stamina/dodge, causes an explosion centered on the mob, the non-magical explosion, crushing damage, is less efficient but hits *anything* bar incoporeal mobs or htose immune to blunt trauma.<br>
<br>
mages need our pets made non-kos, +1-4 levels for post 50 pets, damage for post 50 pets upped by +1-8 hp, fire pets given standard melee damage and lvl 30ish wiz spells, antifearless spell made undispellable, a magic resistant pet (we have FR, CR, DR, PR pets but not magic, which is a pest), summon companion made 1 sec cast, pet hold skill made a lvl 51 skill (currently lvl 59 class skill 6 points which SUCKS), and a nuke that summons a projectile damage is resisted by AC/dodge.<br>
