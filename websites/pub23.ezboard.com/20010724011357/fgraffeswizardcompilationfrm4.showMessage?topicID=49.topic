<br>
My guild was raiding Kedge, as a sort of expeditionary thing since none of us had tackled this dungeon before, and I got tell after tell for ports to GFay.  I sent out a guildsay tell people to gather ar wizzie ports for pick up (since druids were doing the same) and I would ferry and bind as I could.  We get everyone gathered and I get this:<br>
<br>
Guildee:  I need a pick up, had to handle some business.<br>
Me: OK, where are you?<br>
Guildee: Qeynos<br>
Me:  Can you meet me at the WK pyramid and then we'll pop right over?<br>
Guildee:  Sure!<br>
<br>
I get to WK pyramid and wait around then ask the Guildee for an ETA since the raid is getting started.<br>
<br>
Guildee: can you meet me in QHills?  I had to drop somethings off onto another account.<br>
Me:  You're kidding, right?<br>
Guildee:  No, it's gonna take me a few more minutes<br>
<br>
This person has SoW, I do not, but i go there anyway and pick them up get em over to Kedge (they got lost twice getting there) and then the person wants to take over and asks me if I really should be going along...<br>

Person: can you port me to kunark<br>
(do a quick /who on person- anon)<br>
Me: what lvl are you?<br>
Person: 15<br>
Me: I'll take you to the gfey and you can take the boat from BB<br>
Person: Why?<br>
Me: The dreadlands scare me- no one under 30 gets a port from me to there.<br>
<br>
Picture- group in gfey bleeding all over each other:<br>
Person: can I get a port to freeport?<br>
Me: No, just had to evac my group from a nasty pull<br>
Person: Oh? When will you be done?<br>
<br>
The worst place for begging seems to be the dreadlands. I had one person begging for me to run to karnors to get him (I was at the spires waiting on a friend). I could not seem to explain (to the lvl 51) that I was NOT sowed and that everything would aggro on me and that I was being selfish and not willing to risk death for how ever much he was going to give me.<br>
<br>
I was sitting in qeynos waiting to do a character transfer for a guildmate- at this point I think I was bound in iceclad (or pretty far) I had a lvl 3 begging for a tp to tox- I asked him why he didn't just take the boat over- he replied that he didn't like boats... now with the time he spent begging he could have ridden the silly boat. &lt;sigh&gt;<br>
<br>
On the other hand- unlike other characters I do not and will not set a price for tps. I consider what ever they chose or can afford to give to be a donation.. and tps for CR's are free &lt;lol&gt; of course whether it be for for the poor player or the kind cleric  <br>

Since I am the only wizard in the guild (30+ people too, Nobody plays wizards) I got to port the whole damn guild. After many many stops and trips to karnors for evacs we got the raid under way. Took over 2 hours to get to that point. We get deep into kaesora and people have to start leaving. Thank god for a 57 mage who could COH me back down.

The ones where they try to grab you from another zone is irritating.  Not so bad if they come to you.  <br>
<br>
The other times it irks me is when people ask for ports less then 2 zones away.  (eg. asking for a port to Nek from WC)  I have little patience for that, being I remember a time nobody had ports yet and we had to walk everywhere.<br>
<br>
But some folks are learning...if you tell them you're busy, most folks will accept that.<br>

Er... why?  I do still open up shop at Karnor's sometimes to do ports &quot;for donations&quot;.<br>
<br>
As for crossing Dreadlands, that's simple and safe.  I do still suggest Levitate (you do stock bat wings right?) and SOW/JBoots.  There's usually at least one druid at the druid ring in DL (east of wiz spires) too.  The only time I've ever been attacked was in the ice tunnel.  Beyond that, I just run right down the middle and straight to Karnor's.  If you do it right, you can get on top of Karnor's too (nothing to see, but it's fun).<br>

Snow dervishes pop through the walls there all the time. I assume frost giant scouts could be at the portal too, but I've never seen one right at the portal in 40-50 trips there.<br>
<br>
The two primary dangers are zone-lag (I zoned in with 2 bubbles of health left and a dervish beating on me one time thanks to zoning lag... thank goodness I had Steelskin up or I'd have zoned in with half a bubble =P) and group members who insist on stopping to fight whatever jumps them (which means you get to fight half the dervishes in the zone, it seems like =).<br>
<br>
...err back on topic...<br>
<br>
My favorite port request ever was when I was in EK talking to some small guildies, watching them whack gnolls, etc and got a tell from a guy (in zone) who needed a port to NK. I told him that NK was one zone away and he replied that he REALLY needed a port. I just about fell off my chair laughing....<br>
<br>
(It turned out that this guy actually DID need some help, because he'd been killing Muddites in the Gorge and collecting the clay... he was *crawling* and would have died if a gorge hound or something caught him on the way to the vendor...hee hee. I got him a strength buff from a guildie. =)<br>
<br>
My least favorite ports are the ones where you drop what you're doing because it's an EMERGENCY, port one or more snerts wearing gear you've never even heard of before, and then get zilch for your trouble. This used to happen to me a lot; I've fixed it now, though.<br>
<br>
Anyone who cannot spell the word &quot;you&quot; when asking for a port is automatically denied. My clientele is now MUCH more pleasant (and much more likely to pay me something for the lift).<br>
<br>
Snert: plz u port me 2 NK plz?<br>
Me: Sorry, I'm busy!<br>
Snert: ur not ur sittn ther<br>
Me: Sorry, I'm busy!<br>

I got a tell from someone<br>
once..I was riding the boat to Freeport. He was on<br>
one of the islands in OOT. He wanted me to come port<br>
him. I said I can't cast..the boat is moving. He says<br>
jump off the boat. I said NO. lol <br>
<br>
Sometimes I get the impression people figure I'm just<br>
sitting around picking my nose..waiting breathlessly<br>
for a tp request. NOT<br>
<br>
I do things for newbies sometimes..help them out if<br>
they're not being pests and begging. What happens after<br>
though is this...they /tell me..for instance..I'm in <br>
Dragon Necropolis..we're in the middle of a big CR<br>
dragging bodies out of that rat tunnel. One of my <br>
newbie friends../tells me to ask if I'm busy. Hehe I go<br>
yes..I'm busy. Then I explain to them ..what I'm doing<br>
and no I can't run and port them to GFay. <br>
<br>
Had a newbie message me once..wanted me to come<br>
get him in Lake of Ill Omen. Had to explain there are<br>
no tp spots there..and I wasn't going to run around<br>
and look for him. <br>
<br>
What ever happened to taking the durned boat? I took<br>
the boat for ages til I had tp spells..why can't they?<br>
<br>
Either that or message someone thats in the same<br>
zone as they are ..instead of bugging me..when I'm in<br>
some zone like Western Wastes..or Dragon Necropolis.<br>
I'm positive when they scroll thru the list of wizards<br>
that they don't take note of where I am..or ..they<br>
don't have a clue how dangerous an area it is..that<br>
I'm in.<br>
<br>
Wish people would use their brains...<br>

Go to pick up a guy in Inno Swamp. I happened to be bound in U Guk by the dead side zone in so I gave him two options. He goes for L Guk. But I'm sitting there and he doesn't know his way in.<br>
<br>
I always get lost getting out (in is cake) cause I always gate out. I tell him to Go to S Ro. He goes to the zone. He doesn't zone into S Ro so I zone into the swamp telling him to stay put and you guessed it, he finally zones into S Ro.<br>
<br>
I keep telling him to zone into swamp again (I zone slow) and he's asking me where I am. Finally he yells DON'T MOVE I'M ZONING IN in guild chat. 20 minutes later and in a bad mood I'm finally being summoned by a golem like I should have been :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub87.ezboard.com/uaarani.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aarani</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/20/01 3:26:31 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm NOT a Bleepin Taxi!</span><hr size=1> Here's a couple of my favorites.<br>
<br>
I was in a group in Dalnir over the weekend and there was a shadow knight who was getting grief from his family to get off, but he wanted to stay on to level.  Ok, fine.  Just before he had leveled, we lost our monk.  The monk had taken a wrong turn and ended up getting killed by the Overseer.  The Shadow Knight dinged and wanted me to teleport him out right that minute because his family was yelling at him.  Now my group has to do a CR and I teleport him out and there are only 3 people to do it.  I just found it amusing that his family giving him grief wasn't enough to make him log before he dinged, but he had absolutely no patience for a very quick (believe me it was) corpse retrieval for a group member.  We got the corpse and teleported out to DL and now this guy wants us someone to escort him back to the Overthere.  Now this guy has time to spare again!  /boggle<br>
<br>
Another time I was trying to help a friend of a guildie get to DL.  I was hanging out waiting for another guildie and I wasn't planning on being on very long since I had plans in RL so I figured what the hey.  I teleport this guy to DL and he asks me how to get to the Overthere.  I told him I'd run over with him since I needed to change my bind point anyway.  This being my first time through DL, I die in the tunnel.  Ok.  No big deal.  I tp back over to DL and try to drag my corpse only do die again by 2 drolvargs.  Now by no means is this story to rant about the guildie's friend.  Yes, this was my own fault, but I needed to set the stage for what comes up.  A couple of other guildies (one of them being the one I was waiting on in the first place) come over and help me get my corpse.  The rest of my guild was in the process of helping the guy I had tried teleporting in the first place since he made the mistake of trying to help me when I died the second time.  <br>
<br>
Now at this point I am about 30-45 minutes late for my RL plans.  I go over to EC with the guildie I had been waiting on and I get a tell for a tp.  So I tell the person that I am sorry but I am busy and desperately need to camp.  They start giving me grief saying that they can't understand why I can't tp them and then camp.  Boy was this guy's timing bad!  I explain to him that I have just died twice, had to get help doing a CR and am 30-45 minutes late now for my RL plans.  He took the hint and left me alone.  <br>
<br>
I hate getting tells for teleports.  The only time I haven't minded is when it's been more humorous.  Like the time a guy needed a teleport out of Thurgadin because he fell off the bridge up front and was stuck in a hole for 45 minutes.  I didn't get any money out of it, but I did get a good laugh. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And my guildies say that they wish they had this ability so they could make money doing it.  Boy, they don't know what they are wishing for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub87.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=aennyilofkarana>Aennyil of Karana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/21/01 3:08:15 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm NOT a Bleepin Taxi!</span><hr size=1> Or ... how bout this one? You're on an alt character and a friend asks you to go pick up a friend. I was in unrest with the wife of a former guild mate and good eq friend on my 15 bard and she has her 13 cleric hoping to get her lvl so she can load up those nice new spells.<br>
<br>
I tell the guy to let me know when he's there, or close. I get a tell he's in 'the tunnel' (DL). So ... after a couple of mobs I tell my cleric ally to sit by the zone and med, but be careful and I'll be back.<br>
<br>
Get to DL, (with my wiz) no sign of this guy ... send him a tell, no reply. Looking up his name, he's gone from FV to Burning Woods. Thinking maybe he's lost I camp the wiz, and go back to my bard. No cleric ... she had been jumped by a train and never made it (three steps to the zone.)<br>
<br>
I'd forgotten how tough it is to sit with that darned book in my face! hehe ...<br>
<br>
Two hours later, you guessed it, the guy is still in BW hunting. No good deed goes unpunished, but this time a friend got hurt and I could have warned her of the train since bards don't need to look at the book ... well hardly ever, lol. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub87.ezboard.com/uronos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ronos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/21/01 4:10:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I'm NOT a Bleepin Taxi!</span><hr size=1> I cant remeber where or who was asking but I finally got word from a GM on teleporting people to tox or some other out of the way place, as long as they dont specify where they want to go.<br>
<br>
Seems the ranger I did this to on Tallon Zek petioned me for abuse/harrassment. After he killed me and standing over my corpse as I looted asked for a ride out of Kunark. So memmed Tox and ported him out luckily I zoned faster than him and gated out.<br>
<br>
Just make sure IF you do this that no angry killer kobolds are about because that could be considered training.<br>
