<br>
Then I built some friendships and the world changed dramatically, but i still remember being worried if I could actually afford my next set of spells, or hell, buying stacks of food and water..I used to dread having to go to the merchant.<br>

<br>
I remember how rich I thought I was when I turned in 12 bandit sashes at 13th level. <br>
<br>
I remember the day muffins and milk didnt really cut it anymore.<br>
<br>
And I definitely remember literally NOT being able to afford all my 8th level spells. I was running around naked because I had lost my robe somewhere along the line (I actually thought I looked pretty cool!) And a &quot;GOD&quot; (20 something Mage) comes up to me and says &quot;Can I inspect you?&quot; and I said - &quot;ok&quot;, and kept on fighting. The next thing I see is a staff in my trade window. He said &quot;Here take this - its better then what you have!&quot; And he gave me a Runed Totem Staff! I was so excited I had to log out and call my dad (who also plays BTW) and share my good fortune. <br>
<br>
Thats when my dad told me he had lost everything because he went in with a group to Crushbone, and they &quot;dissapeared&quot; on him. He had wandered around inside trying to find his way back out and died. Neither one of us thought it was even possible to go into CB and get his corpse back. &quot;I lost ALL - buddy&quot; he kept saying over and over. <br>
<br>
God - we were such n00bs! Every day was a new adventure. By the time I dinged 12 (like 5 weeks!) we had about 8 regular friends that we played with every day. The first time I went to Qeynos I was 12th level and we split into two groups and made the journey overland. We nearly died when we were jumped by a griffawn in EK, as we came down the ramp. I was never so happy to zone in my entire life.<br>
<br>
I can't imagine a real n00b asking for ports at 6th level, but i suppose it is possible. We never bothered HIGH LEVEL (over 20th!) people because we didn't want to appear foolish, and we wanted to pull our own weight.<br>
<br>
By the gods! Those were good days!~<br>

I waited about 2 minutes when he came back and there it was in the trade window &quot;A runed totem staff&quot;. He clicks on trade and gives it to me. I was totally shocked and was really grateful. I then asked how he could afford it and he said he had a &quot;high&quot; level character (24).<br>

~#Begin Flashback#~<br>
Man, a port was a spell on a list so many levels away you could hardly imagine.<br>
<br>
If you traveled, you prayed someone there was high enough to cast bind.<br>
<br>
You quickly learn to remap the attack hotkey off the letter &quot;A&quot; from then NPC short conversation. (And you still laugh your ass off to see someone else do it and know they yes, they are a new player)<br>
<br>
You went to Runney Eye and cast 'Eye of Zomm' and ran it around freaking people out.<br>
~#End Flashback#~<br>
~#Begin Today#~*growl*(wrong character)..*sigh*<br>
soandso tells you ''<br>
*wait 15 seconds*<br>
soandso tells you 'Can you help me?'<br>
<br>
I'm just amazed at what they think you shoud do, I had someoen want me to drop everything, gate to WC, and TL his friend to bind. Gee willy Beaver, I'm afraid I'm porting guild to a raid and you'll just haveta get bent.<br>
<br>
I got my warrior Goldenpaww to 25 and when I needed to get from LoIO to somewhere to train, what did I do? OK, I shouted for a port willing to pay first, then took the boat when I didn't get a response.<br>
<br>
If I die with him, I loot up and fight to regain the exp. I laugh when I see low lvl's beg for a rez. I only wish I could lvl as fast at 54 as my war does at 25. A lvl in 3-5 hours is so nice.<br>
<br>
The problem is so many help these people the begging is rampent. People should put there foot down and stop helping beggers and the ilk we all hate but are around because PEOPLE HELP THEM!<br>
<br>
Personally, I've only helped those that don't ask for it.  <p><Table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

&quot;Wizards like you.......(you know the words)<br>
LOADING PLEASE WAIT!<br>
Welcome to GNID<br>
You can't memorize this spell, you are TOO LOW YOU NOOB!<br>
DOHT!!!!!!<br>
/shout Need a port to x, for CR, please.<br>
wait 5 mins<br>
rinse, repeat shout<br>
<br>
Finally, someone sends me a tell<br>
Soandso tells you, &quot;come to kel bank&quot;<br>
You tell Soandso, &quot;you can port me?&quot;<br>
/who Soandso<br>
(50 Warrior) Soandso(guild tag) gfaywder<br>
Soandso tells you, &quot;no, but, i'll give you 10pp, to pay someone to take you to x&quot;<br>
<br>
Go find Soandso, get the 10pp, thank him profusly<br>
You tell Soandso, &quot;when i get the money, i'll pay you back&quot;<br>
Soandso tells you, &quot;no, what i want instead, is if you see someone needing help and you can help them, in any way....do it&quot;<br>
<br>
Need less to say, BEGGERS get nothing....but, people willing to learn, get all the help i can give them. I get equipment i don't need(and family characters have better[sometimes, hehe]). I past that out to people.....lvl 1's in felwithe running around going where's this place, where can i find the guild hall...NOT CAN I GET SOME STUFF OR MONEY FROM YOU? I especilly love the warriors who walk up and go, &quot;got any extra stuff?&quot; I'M A FRICKEN WIZARD, I DON'T CARRY EXTRA EQUIPMENT ON ME, LET ALONE MELEE SHIT!!! And any extra melee shit I have gets pasted out in the first 10mins in zone, since I don't have the room in my bank.<br>
<br>
Those people that I help out(buy their lvl 1 spells, give stuff that to a 56 is crap, but to a lvl 1 is the most uber shit they have ever thought to ever see), go on a thanking binge, and &quot;i'll pay you back, honest!&quot;<br>
Can you figure out what I tell them?<br>
<br>
That's right.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you see someone, who you can help, in any way possible for no other reason then to help them? Do it!&quot;<br>
<br>
Maybe if more people....Helped one another, the servers might have alot less assholes, and alot more people worth getting to know.<br>

I told him he would die, but he was insistant.<br>

So, I ported him. Stayed grouped so I could watch his life bar drop, but he went LD about 2 minutes later.<br>

Never heard from him again. ^^ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uinkiewiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Inkiewiz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/5/02 10:45:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=796.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Newbies and Ports</span><hr size=1> My first port (on my main at level 23), I felt like I was flying.

I think I probably got a lot of the gifts that I did because I never asked.  (And, well, maybe 'cause I was a half-naked female.

Got a Flowing black robe at about lvl 24-26, was soo friggin uber, i was so happy.   SLowed down my lvling around that time, and bought a staff of writhing a few month later for 500pp when they were still selling in the 500-1000pp range.  Same price as gatorscale sleeves and some other stuff.   I remember casting my gate to cazik shortly after i gained lvl 24 becuase I wanted to get there and see if i could get some of the rubicite for my SK.  Died about...3 seconds after zoning in, actually got a gm to answer my petition and rez me at the wiz spires there.  Then he took me safely to the zone in.  Very nice GM's back in the day, at least from my point of view.  I made the boatride/run from Tox forest or qeynos to Gfay or unrest many, many times without the use of ports,  I certainly expect the noobs of today to do the same.<br>

I had traveled to far and exotic places (steamfont) once, and even took the boat to far off freeport to sell some batwings. I wanted to goto qeynos because I heard of an earing quest and a ring quest I could do for some nice items. I carefully looked over maps trying to find where I should go. I thought the karanas might be too dangerous for me with the hill giants rumored to be there, so I made the choice to goto tox and take the boat from erudin ( I had always wanted to see erudin anyway) to qeynos. I found someone to take me, who refused my money. And I gated back to felwithe after I got my earrings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/unadiar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nadiar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/6/02 8:14:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=796.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.nadiar.com/pics/sigico.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Newbies and Ports</span><hr size=1> I couldnt afford my level 8 spells and this drove me insane.<br>

I levelled him to about level 17, then started Stumpey.  At that time, the Paladin had never had a port.<br>
<br>
Stumpey first asked for a port at level 2.  He was born in Ak, but wanted to go to Freeport because he hated all the hills.  Someone directed him to the Gfay spires, and he politely asked for a port.  No one responded, so he hooked up with a someone running toward  BB and ran with them.  Got an escort from a nice dwarven warrior to the docks (thank God he was there, I got attacked several times).<br>
<br>
Took the boat to Freeport and grew up.<br>
<br>
Stumpey never had a port until he turned 20 and got his own gate spells.  A nice guildie allowed bought me a copy of one gate spell (to Faymart) and brought it to Kunark where I was hunting (she was coming anyway).  <br>
<br>
Boy was that a rush.<br>
<br>
I have to admit, I hate walking now.  But I really think that travelling far with no ports is a needed right of passage in this game.  Newbies can walk. <p><font face=impact>
