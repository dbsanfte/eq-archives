<br>
&quot;You know, there's other ways to protect yourself than to brandish a gun.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Martial arts is just not a practical means of self defense. The criminals WILL have guns, (as they do, even in Canada) in many situations the only way for a victim to survive is to be armed.<br>
<br>
&quot;As my coworker puts it, &quot;the feeling of need for a firearm is a sign of cowardice.&quot; You think you need to hide behind a 9mm barrel with 17 magnum hollowpoint rounds in the magazine because you are afraid to actually confront those who accost you, and you are not confident enough in your own abilities to realize that there's far better solutions to conflict than violence in any form, even that implied by the presence of a gun.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
This is purely assinine. A CRIMINAL using a gun may be a 'coward'. However is not the job of a woman walking home from work to be brave and 'actually confront those who accost' her. Victims do not ask to be in that situation. Victims do not have to subscribe to your idiotic assertion that cowards deserve to be victimized. Not everyone deludes themselves that they will be fearless when confronted with death. Until it's happenned to you I think your implication that YOU would do so is uninformed and delusional at best and horseshit at worst.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well. So be it. Have you fucking guns, children, but kindly keep the damned things out of my country.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Canada doesn't need to protect their own liberties, they know the US will not allow a rapacious nation on their border and they know they can always flee to the US.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just because I own a gun doesn't mean I want to solve all of my problems with it.&quot; - Brahmin Atman<br>

<br>
&quot;Do you think you'll be able to draw a gun fast enough for them to not realize what you're doing and fire?&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Well since every state with concealed carry laws has reduced crime apparently the CRIMINALS think that this is the case, or at least it is not worth the extra risk. Whether this is the reality or not is rather moot, since even the increased risk of you being armed is enough to deter many criminals.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that if I were a panicked individual, or a criminal, pointing a gun at you and I saw you reaching for a gun in your pocket, I'd shoot.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Yes but this isn't how it usually works. The criminal must needs approach you first. Giving the vigilant time to prepare.<br>
<br>
Certainly being armed is not make you impervious to crime, it never has. However it is absurd to think being armed doesn't help your chances.<br>
<br>
&quot;I have defense techniques for disarming people with guns, but I can't control the Force and disarm them from a distance.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Well if you can control the Force why don't you just take over his mind from a distance and make him give you his gun? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I absolutely agree that Jedi Training &gt;&gt; carrying a sidearm, but most of us do not have enough midichlorians floating around in our blood for that to be practical. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&quot;Everybody should go through self defense training, at the very least.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Why? Because if they do not do so they deserve to be victimized?<br>
<br>
&quot;there's far better solutions to conflict than violence in any form&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
History proves you wrong. It turns out violence is the only option in some circumstances. Else why do you practice martial arts?<br>
<br>
&quot;The only possible reason for you to want a concealable firearm is to perform a criminal act. If you are not intending to break the law with your firearm, you don't need to hide it. That, in itself, invalidates your argument.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
LOL. Despite this being patently preposterous, I only need one counterexample to disprove this. But I will provide tens of thousands. The examples provided by all the people that carry legally licensed concealed weapons for self defense. <br>
<br>
And commit no crimes.<br>
<br>
Further there is good data on people with concealed carry permits, obviously, and the people with them have drastically lower crime rates than the population at large.<br>
<br>
Both BY and AGAINST them.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, you openly admit to wanting to propagate hate literature against a group in society?&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
He never said that. Don't be an ass.<br>
<br>
&quot;We're simply defending the rights of homosexuals and other individuals under our charter of rights and freedoms. Canada is progressive that way.&quot; - Aurianne<br>
<br>
Progressively censoring the minority in favor of the majority. Rock on wit yo selves.<br>
<br>
&quot;However, some interest groups, most noteably the Gun Lobby and the Anti-Drug lobby, asked themselves - &quot;How can I use the murder of 3,000 innocent Americans to further my own political agenda.&quot;&quot; - Torcer<br>
<br>
Lol, this is so backward. It is the gun grabbers that used 911. Basically this has been a heyday for that abombination of politics, 'the law and order liberals'.. the baby boomers grown up, the fiscal liberal but social conservatives.<br>
<br>
Yes the drug interdiction gang has profitted but so have the gun grabbers.<br>
<br>
The NRA is acting proactively against popular support for degrading civil liberties in favor of 'national security'. They may not succeed.<br>
<br>
&quot;Gun ownership limit should be 25 or older.&quot; - Eamin<br>
<br>
I have no problem with this, but then 25 should be the age of majority. Well actually I do have a problem with this because it would be an unworkable law, just like setting the drinking age at 21. What bufoon figured out that piece of genius.<br>
<br>
&quot;2) Cars are not used to PURPOSEFULLY kill people.&quot; - Eamin<br>
<br>
Incorrect.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just out of curiousity, what absolutes did the authors of the Constitution believe in? As I recall, the only thing they all agreed on completely was the existence of God.&quot; - Raufaan<br>
<br>
Franklin was an atheist, among others. I don't think they completely agreed on anything except that invoking the divine couldn't hurt but might help.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is such a common argument, and it is incredibly flawed. Have you ever heard of amendments? The constitution can be changed. It was intended to be changed.&quot; - Liquid<br>
<br>
Yes but it has not been.<br>
<br>
Further if you read the writings of the people in question (federalist papers, anti-federalist papers, etc) it is clear they thought the right to bear arms and further the common excercise of that right was necessary to ensure a free state.<br>
<br>
&quot;...... but I doubt any one of them considered that in the future &quot;arms&quot; would include automatic weapons that can be concealed in a pocket, can be quickly reloaded, are accurate at reasonably long range, and which (in short) give a single person the potential to quickly kill large numbers of people.&quot; - Bone<br>
<br>
Well I don't know if the machinegun was imagined by this point, but I am sure they could have understood the concept if it was. And I am sure they would not have thought that the _government_ should have exclusive right to such weapons. The POINT was to keep govt honest.<br>

Lol, you asked me if I knew, apparently YOU don't.  The constitution provides for the impeachment of justices, which has been used.<br>
<br>
If a justice were to be so onerous that the president and 2/3 of congress all agree, bing gone justice. That this does not happen often is partly because getting those numbers is hard to do and partly because they were already vetted up front by the legislature.

The burden of proof is equally heavy on all participants in any discussion, thanks.  Theorizing that it would be impossible to undo a revokation of the 2nd Amendment doesn't mean anyone else has to prove his case more effectively than you.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I certainly didn't mention revoking the 2nd Amendment.  I got involved in this discussion when Grim started talking nonsense, and only intended to point out how ridiculous his position was.  I personally believe that people should have the right to own any gun they want because, frankly, it's possible to purchase anything if the price is right.  I reject your arguments, however, because I simply don't believe the authors of the Bill of Rights would agree that all guns are equal and necessary for the continuance of our freedoms.  That's just my opinion as derived from my reading of various documents and point of view.<br>

That's just utter bullshit. Arming yourself does nothing at all if the criminal is going to shoot first. If anything, reaching for your gun provokes them to shoot first.<br>

Yes but this isn't how it usually works. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The criminal must needs approach you first. Giving the vigilant time to prepare.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Certainly being armed is not make you impervious to crime, it never has. However it is absurd to think being armed doesn't help your chances.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The bullshit continues. You state that martial arts aren't a viable form of defense. You then say that for a gun to be effective, the criminal needs to approach you. Ok. When the criminal approaches you, the martial arts become an effective defense.<br>
<br>
I can categorically guarantee you that fighting unarmed gives me a better chance at surprising you than reaching for a gun. If you're approching close enough to take my wallet out of my hand, you're close enough for me to have you semi-conscious on the ground before you know what hit you. It's undisputable fact that people move faster when they're unencumbered, and that speed is an extremely important factor in surprising your opponent.<br>
<br>
Further, your use of the word &quot;vigilant&quot; provokes images of vigilante justice. Perhaps this is your intent, but you should also realize that vigilante justice is one of the main things that the gun control lobby is trying to prevent.<br>

<br>
Interesting rhetoric you're using here. Do you not think I'd be censored if I were to start publishing statements like &quot;all niggers are thieves and should be preemptively thrown in jail&quot;? (incidentally, I do not feel this way, and want to apologize in advance to any who were offended by the wording.)<br>
<br>
I fail to see how that statement is any different from the statement &quot;all fags are evil and going to hell&quot;. It's not. So why impose a double standard? Is it just because the african people have more numbers and are a more powerful force to fight against? If you would defend the blacks against the above, you should do it for the right reasons: it is the product of uneducated and uninformed presuppositions based on stereotypes. Well, so, too, is the statement about homosexuals, and they're entitled to just as much defense from the general public.<br>
<br>
So forgive me if your attempt to argue that point is dismissed out of hand, but perhaps you should actually make a valid point. <br>

You're a retard for this one. Canada's liberties and freedoms are protected by the fact that we're actually liked and respected in the international community. We prefer to let our actions and achievements speak for themselves, instead of bluster and interfere. A method of achieving respect among other nations that doesn't brew seething hatred, unlike the American foreign policy.<br>

Y'know, it would be a stronger deterrent if the criminal could see the Glock 17 by your side, rather than take the chance that you don't have a gun.<br>

The only reason for you to want to hide your gun is if you intend to do something for which it shouldn't be known you have a gun: when you expect interdiction and don't want your opponent to know you are armed. How many situations can you think of where this is the case? I want a list.<br>

The purpose of martial arts is a preventative measure, not so that people who don't do it can be victimized.

Well I don't know if the machinegun was imagined by this point, but I am sure they could have understood the concept if it was. And I am sure they would not have thought that the _government_ should have exclusive right to such weapons. The POINT was to keep govt honest.<br>

Machine guns have been around since the mid-14th century. They were practically useless until Gatling made his gun in the mid-19th century.<br>
<br>
More realistically, they probably thought that machine guns would never work, given the state of the technology at the time the document was written, and as such didn't need to include provisions about them.<br>

<br>
As for why I participate in martial arts? It has nothing to do with wanting to beat you up, and never has. I'm a martial artist because of the discipline it teaches me about myself, and because of the physical fitness and endurance it teaches my body. I've also attained a great deal of flexibility as a result of my training: how many people do you know who can kick a target suspended 6 feet off the ground without jumping? (Side kick or roundhouse, if you know what those are. I'm actually reaching a plateau of 6'6&quot;, and that's a result of my physical size, not my flexibility.)<br>

<br>
In any event. I don't think it's all that important: I live in a country where we have gun control, and I've realized with your help that there's no point in trying to debate a topic like this with somebody who will dogmatically defend their position without any basis save the propaganda of one organization. If you think the NRA is telling you the whole truth about guns, I've got a nice stretch of land in the Florida Everglades for you, real cheap. <p><center><embed src="http://rkroll.magma.ca/aurie/aurianne.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#FFFFFF width=430 height=65 wmode=window

You're looking too hard to make your point, Aurianne.  The spirit of the 2nd Amendment is that the simple citizens of the U.S. should be armed in case they need to rise up against a tyrannical government.  It's unlikely that the founding fathers would insist that citizens only fight with the weapons that were available in the late 18th century.  The 2nd Amendment doesn't have the &quot;right to bear muskets&quot;.  The founding fathers knew that firearm technology would progress past muskets.  So it became the &quot;right to bear arms&quot;.  I think that the fathers wrote &quot;arms&quot; precisely because they meant the term to be flexible.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If the spirit of the 2nd Amendment is to provide for defense against a tyrannical government and that government has machine guns, then the citizenry should have machine guns too.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to address an unwritten bias (and a seemingly irrational one) in your posts, Aurianne.<br>
<br>
You seem unable to accept (or even countenance) the notion that a person might own a gun (or lots of guns or big machine-guns) and not have a desire to use it in a criminal manner.  Just because I buy a gun doesn't mean that I'm going to do something horrible with it.  If I buy a car, it doesn't mean that I'm going to get drunk and kill someone in an accident.  If I buy a car, it doesn't mean that I'm going to go on a cross-country road-trip from NY to LA.  <br>
<br>
I say this in the spirit of constructive criticism: your stance against liberal gun laws seems to be overwhelmed by emotion and irrationality.  It's based on a horrible perception of human nature that paints humanity as savages.  There is an extreme distrust of human nature and human freedom.  As a Canadian citizen, it simply surprises me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Brahma Atman Erudite Wizard Bertoxx</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubrahmaatman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brahma Atman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/02 7:39:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> Raufann wrote:<br>

The burden of proof for any argument is based on the strength of the argument.  If your argument is making a very strong claim (&quot;The Sun revolves around the Earth&quot;), then you have a tremendous burden of proof over a milder claim (&quot;Some albino cats have a greater risk of hairballs&quot;).<br>

Again, you say that there are no circumstances in which you might consider that the citizens of the U.S. might be able to overthrow the government, despite the fact that there could be as much as a 25:1 manpower advantage of citizens over the military.
