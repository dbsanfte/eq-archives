But I took some time to try and see what the connecting phrases are.  Here's what I've found.  Please feel free to add to the story.<br><br>- Petel<br><br><br>Rough Silver Chain / Captains Nalots Triple Strength Rum<br><br>End result: Rough Silver Chain, LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM NO DROP, AC: +5, Magic Resist: +5, Fire Resist: +5, Cold Resist: +5, Poison Resist: +5, Disease Resist: +5, HP: +30 Mana: +30, Weight: 0.3. Classes: Cleric Druid Shaman Wizard Magician Enchanter Necromancer <br>Races: All. Inventory Slot: Neck<br><br>Note: Most of the info on this quest can be found in many EQ sites. Ive just added my notes and some general text so you know what the quest is all about. Hopefully, I will add pictures and locs so this will be a full quest outline. <br><br>This quest starts in Iceclad Ocean, in the Pirate Gnome outpost. The whole pirate outpost is kinda cute. If you poke around, hailing and talking to gnomes, you will find that they set off on a great adventure to be Pirates. Alas, their ship was wrecked and they are stranded in Iceclad Ocean. One of the pirates made a map and lost it (that's another quest). Some gnomes are really into playing pirates and like the idea of shouting 'Arrrr' with every sentence; some are really fed up with it. In any case, it seems that a marvelous brew, Captain's Nalot's Triple Strength Rum is missing.<br><br>Here're some of the conversations that go around<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Relit'<br>Relit says 'Oooerrrr. Avast yer bilge, uh, brain. How was that, Traboh? <br>Traboh sighs. 'Keep tryin', Relit.' <br>You say, 'Hail, Traboh'<br>Traboh says 'Arrr. Blast yer bilgewater brain! Can't ye see I'm guardin' this unsavory wharfrat? Shove off, mate! <br>Relit says 'Hey! That was great, Trab! That sounded real authentic-like. <br>Traboh grins. 'Did ya really think that was good? I've been practicing my arrrs.'<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Tsilos the Swabby'<br>Tsilos the Swabby says 'H-hi. I'm Tsilos. I'm a swabbie. That means I get to swab the decks. We don't have decks any more so they only let me run paths in the snow. I get to make lots of lines here and there so the other guys have nice places to walk on. It's not a bad job, except for the yelling. <br>You say, 'what yelling?'<br>Tsilos the Swabby says 'All the shouting and ordering. It makes me nervous. I get a little scared when everyone is yelling. <br>Captain Nalot says 'WHAT?! Codsarnit boy! This be a pirate camp. Ye best batten down those matches and learn ta be tough or ya ain't ever gonna make it! <br>Tsilos the Swabby shivers. 'Y-yes Cap'n. I'm tough. I'm a t-tough pirate..'<br><br>Go to the docks on the same island (+5068, +697)<br>You say, 'Hail, Masurt Dok'<br>Masurt Dok says 'That's me name, me job too. 'Masert ub da dok,' as a mate once called me. Course I was the bosun at the time, and we weren't at a dock, but he was drunk. Captain Nalot's Triple Strength will do that to ya. <br>You say, 'What is Captain Nalot's Triple Strength?'<br>Masurt Dok says 'Aye. A better rum I never had. Warms the stomach and brings a tear to yer eye. Our leader, Captain Nalot, used ta make it. Can't find any ingredients in this ice clad hell, though. <br>You say, 'what ingredients?'<br>Masurt Dok says 'I'm no brewer, mate. Best ask the Captain.<br><br>Note: Nelet Durzit and Rendap might be stuck in the water under the dock, so if they're not at the docks, duck down under and look for him.<br><br>Rendap says 'Arrr. Swab me ports and shiver me starboards! Another mainlander, eh? Come closer, laddy, I can't sees ya too well. Arr, that's better. If ya came fer frostbite, frozen pants, and an empty stomach then ya came to the right place. Plenty o' sights ta see here.<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Nelet Durzit'<br>Nelet Durzit sneezes and wipes his hand across his nose. 'H-h-h-i.' <br>Rendap says 'Nelet don't talk much anymore. All this cold really gets to 'im. <br>You say, 'what cold?'<br>Nelet Durzit talks through clenched, chattering teeth. 'Y-y-yeah. C-cursed cold. Sh-sh-shot of gnomish pirate triple strength rum's all I need ta fix me up, Rendap tells me. N-n-nilham lost it all, though.'<br><br>If you listen carefully you will find that Nilham the chef is in the brig for losing the Triple Strength Rum'<br><br>Adisson Stubblechin says 'Don't be thinkin' I was forgettin' ya, Nilham, ya spotty-faced salt licker. Remember, ya tell us where ya put our rum, an' we let ya out. Otherwise, ya have ta stay here!<br><br>Go find Nilham the Chef.<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Nilham the Chef' <br>Nilham the Chef says 'Ahoy, Petel . Welcome ta the brig. I didn't get ta the 'B' section of my piratisms manual so I'm not sure what a brig is but I'm guessin' it means 'really small place without enough food or water.' So, ya here ta stay or just visitin'?<br>You say, 'i am here to stay'<br>Nilham the Chef grins. 'Not sure what ya did ta have ta stay but take a seat. There's a good starin' wall right over there. Don't hurt yerself with excitement.'<br>You say, 'what piratisms manual?' <br>Nilham the Chef says 'Aye. We all got a pirate grammar manual from the good cap'n. We were supposed ta learn how ta talk like proper pirates from all the books Cap'n Nalot read but I never had time cause I used ta be the cook and was too busy. That's really the only bad thing about this brig thing really. <br>You say, 'bad thing' <br>Nilham the Chef says 'I don't have anythin' ta read. No books here at all. I don't mind bein kept in here cause I don't have ta cook or work anymore but it'd be great ta have somethin' ta read. I still wanna learn more words. <br>--- I'm missing some text here ---<br>You say, 'What cat?' <br>Nilham the Chef says 'That was a nasty cat. I dun think it was after us, though. I think it just smelled the fresh chunk of wooly rhino jerky I had. It didn't do anythin' but knock us over. I guess that's what it likes, walrus. After it knocked us over it slipped away towards the bridge island like a ghostly mist. I'm thinkin I saw a glimmer in its maw while it was runnin off.'<br><br>It seems that the 'nasty cat' snatched something from Nilham the chef. Actually, it took the key to the rum box containing Captain Nalot's Triple Strength Rum. The 'nasty cat' is the level 60 Mist Panther south of the lake at the entrance to the Plane of Growth in Wakening Land. Clues to its whereabouts can also be traced from the Gnomish deserter in the Great Divide (see below).<br><br>Go to Eastern Wastes. Kill wooly rhinos until you get four &quot;fresh&quot; chunks of rhino meat. Note that it must be 'Fresh'. The normal rhino meat is not what you need. You can also auction for it, since it's neither NO DROP nor is it LORE. If you enter the Eastern Wasted from Iceclad Ocean, turn right and follow the water till you see Ulthork and Rhinos. That's the best place to hunt them down. Rhinos are all green to level 56 and can be easily quad-kited. The fresh meat is somewhat rare; I got 1 in 8 kills.<br><br>Once you have four fresh chunks of wooly rhino meat, head off to Wakening Land and find the Mist Panther. He is a beautiful white cat. If you are KOS to him, ask a kind Druid to cast Wolf Form on you.<br><br>--- I'm missing some text when hailing him ---<br><br>Give the 4 chunks of fresh rhino meat to the panther and you'll find a broken golden key in your inventory.<br><br>Mist panther jumps at you and snatches the meat from your hand. It runs away from you and feasts on the other side of the water. As it runs away you notice a small shiny object fall from its mouth.<br><br>Head of to Coablt Scar and find the named Othmir Qargy Scallopgobbler (-804, -415 - the sea shell house closest to Skyshrine zone in)..<br>You say, 'Hail, Qarrgy Scallopgobbler'<br>Qarrgy Scallopgobbler sets down several large crustacean shells covered in foreign runes, then extends his large, coarse hands in a gesture of friendship. 'I am pleased to see friendly visitors to our villages. I am the head craftsman of the village. The crustacean shell armor worn by the warriors of our village was crafted by me and by my apprentices. I will craft other materials as well when they are available.' <br>You say, 'what crustacean shell armor?'<br>Qarrgy Scallopgobbler says 'It takes awhile to make each piece. It has to go through a long burning process to clean away all old meat and dirt. Then it needs shaping and etching with runes. <br>You say, 'what long burning process?'<br>Qarrgy Scallopgobbler says 'Usually I use a mixture made from the livers of barraccudas. Their liquids are very strong and make good burning liquid. If you want some you need to bring me two barraccuda livers.<br><br>Get two Coldwater Barracuda livers from coldwater barracudas in the bay in Cobalt Scars. Easiest way to find them is have an Enduring Breath spell cast on you (or use a Water stone from a friendly magician, or an EB item). If you port into CS, from the dragon ring, turn right and hit the beach. Follow the wall along the beach. There is a pop of 3 Coldwater Barracuda. They have roughly 700-800hp. If you're a Wizard (/wink), just use one of your pillar line of spells to kill all in one shot. Livers are semi-rare too and are NO-DROP.<br><br>Give Qargy the two Coldwater Barracuda livers.<br>Qarrgy Scallopgobbler slams a knife into the various livers and squeezes out all of their various goos and juices. Eventually he seperates a bit of it and pours it into a protective bladder. &quot;Excellent work. This good catch. Here, you have sack of ooze. Its good for burning things off or etching metals. Thank you for your help.'<br>You now have a bladder of acidic ooze.<br><br>Now, I have no idea who originally solved this part of the quest, and I have no way of finding how the hell he came up with the solution. Nonetheless...<br><br>Go to Wakening Lands. Forage Fresh Tree Sap. Random forage chance. This will have to be done by a forager and multi-quested with you (if you are unable to forage) due to the sap is a NO DROP item.<br><br>Go to Thurgadin and find Pythic Urson. He is in the bar in the back area next to the mines. He needs a mixture to clean his boots. <br>You say, 'Hail, Pythic Urson'<br>Pythic Urson turns and looks at you. 'What?' He goes back to drinking his ale and resting. <br>You say, 'what ale?'<br>Pythic Urson says 'Its a fine Coldain ale. Good for quenchin yer thirst after a hard day of minin. The ales name doesnt matter cause ya wouldnt be able to hold it down anyways. Har har. <br>You say, 'mining'<br>Pythic Urson says 'Aye. Mining. Im a miner. Thats a hard one to put together eh? Yer about as sharp as me hammer and as quick as the mining crud on me boots. <br>You say, 'crud'<br>Pythic Urson says 'Mining crud, thats what I said. Mixture o' velium dust, mud, and whatever other junk is left on the floor after I be minin. Hard as a giant to fight off me boots. <br>You say, 'boots'<br>Pythic Urson says 'There used ta be a mixture we used ta clean off our boots but that was when we had more warriors ta get ta different places. Now it aint possible so the crud just keeps buildin up on me boots. <br>--- I'm missing some text regarding Pythic Urson's cleaning mixture---<br><br>Give Fresh Tree Sap and bladder of acidic ooze to Pythic Urson. In return, you will get a portion of his boot-cleaning-mixture -- the bottle of Dissolving Liquid (looks like a SoW potion). <br><br>Pythic Urson laughs at you and then takes the sap and bladder. He mixes the two together and then adds something from a small pouch he carries. With a quick sizzle he pours some on his boots and the crud melts away. 'See that? Didnt do anything but get rid of the crud. This stuff is great. It doesn't burn your skin or valuables. Here ya go, ya can have the rest.'<br>You gain party experience!!<br><br>You now have bottle of dissolving liquid, LORE, NO DROP.<br><br>Go to the Great Divide. <br><br>Find the Gnomish Deserter (-3928, -567, +794), who is at the very top of the mountain in the middle (the one that has the wurm tunnels). Better have levitate cast on you in case you slip.<br><br>You say, 'Hail, gnomish deserter'<br>gnomish deserter smiles at you and nods congenially. 'Hullo there. Nice ta meet ya.' He moves to shake your hand and then seems to remember that his hand is currently frozen to a very heavy, very solid hunk of metal shaped somewhat like a box.<br>You say, 'why are your hands stuck?'<br>gnomish deserter says 'Erm. Well ya see. One day I was on guard duty and a huge white cat knocked me over. It looked like it was running away towards the bridge island. Anyways, I fell into the water. I guess I passed out because next thing I knew I was over near the gnolls laying on top of this huge box. It's then that I made the decision.<br><br>You say, 'what decision?'<br>gnomish deserter says 'To leave. I'm really tired of this pirate stuff. Captain Nalot said it was gonna be great fun and an adventure but all I've seen is alot of biscuits, slush water, and guard duty. So I'm here. <br><br>You say, 'why are you here?'<br>gnomish deserter says 'Yup. This isn't such a bad spot. It's nice and peaceful. I can see for miles and every once in a while someone like you drops by to talk. There's no guard duty and I don't have to say 'Arrrr' anymore. That really starts to hurt your throat, you know. The only problem I have anymore is my hand frozen to this box. If ya find a way to fix it let me know.<br><br>You say, 'what box'<br>gnomish deserter says 'Huh? Box? Where's a box? Heh. I don't see a box.<br><br>Give the bottle of dissolving liquid to the Gnomish Deserter<br><br>gnomish deserter grins and pours the ooze on his hand and the box. You hear a burning sizzle and then the box thumps onto the ground. 'Ow! Ow! Take it! Hah. I never thought I'd get rid of that piece of...'<br><br>You should now have in your inventory a locked rum box.<br><br>While in Great Divide, kill Dire Wolves, too. You need 1 High Quality Dire Wolf Pelt. I got one after 25 kills. <br><br>Go to the gnoll village by the Tower of Frozen Shadow in Iceclad Ocean. Give the snowfang gnoll named 'Errgriz' in one of the tents the High Quality Dire Wolf Pelt. <br>Errgiz starts to cut and scrape the furs. He growls softly as he works and his master watches his progress. 'Grrr. Much too small. I fail. I not ready to work on my own. Sorry to waste your time. Here, take what I made. Maybe you can find use for it.'<br><br>You now have Wolf Fur Earcovers, LORE, NO DROP.<br><br>Go to Sojan the Sleepless (+4541, +1276) in the igloo in the gnome pirate village in Iceclad. <br>Sojan the Sleepless stares at you through bleary eyes. 'I get enough conversation from my wife. If ya want water or biscuits, buy em! Otherwise, leave me alone!'<br><br>Give Sojan the Wolf Fur Earcovers.<br><br>Sojan the Sleepless stares at you and then laughs before putting on the earmuffs. As he moves around, blissfully protected from noise, a fine chain slips from his coat. 'Hey! Look at that! What a fine chain. It looks familiar but I can't tell how. Oh, well, you can have it. It looks like it could be used to fill gaps or if needed to repair another similar metal object. I can do that if ya ever find need.'<br>You should now have a fine metal chain. <br>Give Sojan the fine metal chain and the broken golden key and get rum box key back. <br>Sojan the Sleepless puts a tiny eyeglass up to his eye and studies the key and chain. 'Aye. This looks like the perfect metal to fix this key. Gimme just a moment.' He uses fine and minute tools to pick and push the chain and key over a fire. 'Ha! Don't say I ain't never done anythin' for ya. There ya go, Petel .'<br><br>Go to Captain Nalot in the igloo to the North. <br><br>Captain Nalot squints at you through one eye, the other covered by a metallic eyepatch. 'Garrr. What `ave we here? Another beller yellied land blubber eh? By the looks of ye someones mudder didnt know when ta throw a bad fish back. HAR HAR!'<br><br>--- I'm missing some text here ---<br>Give him the rum box and key, get a bottle of Captain Nalot's Triple Strength back. <br>Captain Nalot says 'Land ho! That be me rum! Where did ya get that? Ah nevermind. Gimme those things. Just a bit of a turn here... and a pick there... and a twist... and shes unlocked, har! Here, take a jug. It be the least I can do fer ye. We'll be havin a party tonight lads! <br>You gain experience!!<br><br>Go to the docks on the same island. <br><br>Rendap says 'Arrr. Swab me ports and shiver me starboards! Another mainlander, eh? Come closer, laddy, I can't sees ya too well. Arr, that's better. If ya came fer frostbite, frozen pants, and an empty stomach then ya came to the right place. Plenty o' sights ta see here.<br><br>You say, 'Hail, Nelet Durzit'<br>[Nelet Durzit sneezes and wipes his hand across his nose. 'H-h-h-i.' <br>Rendap says 'Nelet don't talk much anymore. All this cold really gets to 'im. <br>You say, 'what cold?'<br>Nelet Durzit talks through clenched, chattering teeth. 'Y-y-yeah. C-cursed cold. Sh-sh-shot of gnomish pirate triple strength rum's all I need ta fix me up, Rendap tells me. N-n-nilham lost it all, though.'<br><br>Give the rum to Nelet Durzit. Get the Rough Silver Chain in return.<br><br>Nelet Durzit greedily swigs rum from the jug. After a few drinks, he starts to gag and make faces. 'Oh, geez! Rendap told me this stuff was strong but this tastes like clockwork grease! It burns but now I feel - ugh.' Nelet doubles over and passes out on the ground. As he falls over, a small silver trinket slips out of his pocket. <br><br>Rendap points and laughs as Nelet falls over. 'That'll put hair on yer ears, boy. Suck it up.
