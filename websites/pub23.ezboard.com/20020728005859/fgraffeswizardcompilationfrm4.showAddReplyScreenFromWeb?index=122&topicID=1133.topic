Because the books are the core of every religion, there is no way to validate the religion unless you have first validated the books. It is highly unlikely that the Bible or Qur'an are completely made up, and I myself do not believe that, but until you have unequivocal proof that your book of choice is the official Word of God don't run around converting people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umelcar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>melcar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/21/02 11:53:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: and so do i</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  until you have unequivocal proof that your book of choice is the official Word of God don't run around converting people. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

The thing that makes Christianity so different is we proclaim that our Messiah was risen from the dead.  Remember Jesus is God in the flesh.  Why did God become man?   To personally identify with our pain and suffering.  He went through everything we will ever go through and fulfilled the law of the OT<br>
<br>
I will defend Revelation by saying this.. In revelation the book speaks of a One world government.  May I say that is where we are headed my friends.  Just check out the United nations and whats going on in the Middle East.  I think I heard of a world court where war criminals will be carried to trial.  The chip implants which carry all your info around that can be placed in your right hand or forehead.  They carry all info about you including medical history etc...<br>
<br>
Just those 2 truths out of that book are accurate.  IN the future we will have a one world government it's so obvious and out there.  <br>
<br>
As far as a man being responsible for the light he has seen is very true indeed.  Yes I can give scripture and will post it as soon as I can find it.   Can't remember the exact chapter and verse but Paul said it in one of his letters and that is good news.<br>
<br>
When I have looked all this stuff up I will post it ASAP.  I usually don't do debates just seemed this one would help someone who was reading with there faith and belief system.<br>
<br>
Salvation was made easy for us all but some organizations make it seems kinda hard.  Remember everyman is held accountable for himself and for the things he/she has seen and heard.<br>

<br>
Untrue.  A previous poster mentioned a criteria which would be suitable for him.  In any case, if you have an omniscient deity, it would know the requisite evidence, and if it wants us to believe, it should present it.  You have not presented any sort of incontrovertible evidence.  Quite the opposite, really.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The thing that makes Christianity so different is we proclaim that our Messiah was risen from the dead.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Heroes and saviors that sacrifice themselves and then are risen from the dead are not that uncommon in mythology.  Such themes predate Christian belief.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Remember Jesus is God in the flesh. Why did God become man? To personally identify with our pain and suffering. He went through everything we will ever go through and fulfilled the law of the OT&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
But isn't your deity omniscient?  This is what we are told, and if so it can already identify with our suffering.  When did Jesus experience pregnancy and childbirth?  Really, he didn't experience that much at all.  I'm not sure what you mean by fulfilling the law of the OT.  Jesus defied it on occasion (compare the picking corn &quot;sabbath discussion&quot; scene with Numbers 15) and didn't qualify to be the fuilfillment of Messianic prophecies, so not sure where you're going there.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Remember everyman is held accountable for himself and for the things he/she has seen and heard.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
And evidently they are accountable for things they haven't seen/heard, and shall pay eternally for it.<br>
<br>
As for Revelation, I don't think the UN qualifies in any way as a world government; quite a few nations (including the US) are opposed to that level of authority, and I don't see it happening.  Cheers,<br>

<br>
Of course every man is responsible for their own life (or light as you call it.. if that is what you meant. I am not sure). I don't really need scripture because it is obvious. I am happy with my life. The things that might bother me at this point I can change myself.<br>
<br>
Although I am sure this will add fuel to your fire but.. I have no need to be forgiven. I've lived my life and I am proud of the life I've lived. No complaints here. I do not need saving.<br>
<br>
Religion and faith are facinating (especially faith. I don't understand the concept of faith at all). That does not mean that I feel any need to include it in my own personal life.<br>
<br>
<br>
To slightly change the subject.. I want to say that I can really dig Jesus' style. Everything he said was well thought out and would lead to a better world I am sure.. if it wasn't so confused by the people who came after him. I do not accept his divinity. He was a historical figure. The problem, IMHO, is that he was made into a myth by his followers. Trying to make him larger than life. You have got to separate the myth from the man. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uphuongmasters00.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PhuongMasters00</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/22/02 3:34:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=127>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ask and you recieve</span><hr size=1> Here are the scriptures you all requested concerning many different issues.

Give me scripture and I will be happy to explain even giving you scriptures to back up the scripture that you say is wrong or confusing.<br>
<br>
Luke 8:18 describes interpertation of what you read in the gospel.<br>
<br>
Luke 10:10-17 speaks of him healing on the sabbath which was unlawful but I want you to read and understand why he did it.  Jesus also might I add was without sin.  Therefore fulfilled the law in Deuteronomy.  Remember you had the Deuteronomy code and the Law of Moses which these rulers in this day cherished the Law of Moses.  Remember also these men were religious and hypocrites &quot;putting heavy weights on men&quot;  and failed to carry the burden themselves.  Remember the woman who committed adultry and he said &quot;He who has no sin cast the first stone.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Luke 16:19-31 is a good parable concerning where you go when you die.  Remember also read this and understand.  It also speaks of someone not believing even if the dead came back to tell about the gospel.  Remember read and understand not using intellect Luke 8:18 explained about reading and interpreting.<br>
<br>
Mark 13:10 is what proves that if you have not heard the gospel there is no way you can be held responsible if you have not heard.  God gives everyone a chance my friends.  Also in the stewardship parables you see that when much is given much is expected and to whom has little then little is expected of him.<br>
<br>
1st Thessalonians This scripture backs up much of Revelation itself.  Also when Jesus spoke about the end times it backs up Revelation<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I will comment on the UN again.  You all ever wonder why there is so much controversy in the Middle East?  It's all in the gospels my friends the answers are in the bible itself.<br>
<br>
The UN maybe small now and the things might not be that major to you but I see what it COULD be and what it WILL be in the future.  Everything you see now is just a seed soon that seed shall grow up and you will understand the fullness of what I am saying.<br>
<br>
All these countries get together to decide that fate of another country.  <br>
<br>
Revelation 13:11-18 speaks of the one world leader.  Pay close attention to verses 16 and 17.  Also in Revelation 17 the entire chapter is important.  Pay close attention to verses 3 and 4.  To help some out a bit mountains are symbolical of kingdoms or nations.<br>
<br>
Daniel 7 This entire chapter compliments the scriptures I gave in Revelation.  Pay close attention to the last beast Daniel saw it's the same beast in Revelation that came out of the earth.<br>
<br>
Here is some clear evidence backed with scripture.<br>
<br>
Lastly Romans 1:18-32 explains why everyone is held accountable for what they know.  The first few verses 18 - 20.<br>

You have NOT produced a single SHRED of evidence my friend.  You have only produced a recount of your magic internal FEELINGS about your &quot;relationship&quot; with God.  Which isn't a problem, it is the nature of the unknowable after all, but it ain't evidence by a long shot.  The Bible itself is dubious evidence at best due to its metamorphosis over the years.<br>

I have no problem with your faith man, indeed i admire the strength of your convictions, and i'm glad you found something to turn your life around.  My biggest problem with Christianity is this &quot;our's is the only path, the rest of you are going to hell&quot; nonsense.  And you only continue to prove my point.  I accept that the Christian creed can lead one to an honorable life.  I also accept that other religions and teachings can do the same.  And i still fail to understand how you can beleive that your benevolent God would summarily damn so many just based on the place or time of their birth, not on their deeds at all!   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umandari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandari</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.nc.rr.com/prismites/icon1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/22/02 8:02:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=129>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.nc.rr.com/prismites/icon1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ask and you recieve</span><hr size=1> &lt;&lt; Jesus did in fact fulfill the law of God.

<br>
In the gospels (sorry, don't recall chapter) Jesus and his disciples pick corn on the Sabbath.  The Pharisees point out this violation, and Jesus responds, &quot;The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.&quot;  This sounds fair enough until you check out Numbers 15:32-36.  A man is picking up sticks to make a fire to cook his meal.  He is caught and brought for judgement.  The Lord commands Moses to put the man to death, and so he is stoned as God commanded.  I see no difference between Jesus' corn picking and this man's stick picking.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Luke 8:18 describes interpertation of what you read in the gospel.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
All 8:18 says is, &quot;Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.&quot;  This says nothing of interpretation, other than that you should be careful how you interpret it.  Weak advice at best.<br>
<br>
BTW, this follows 8:10, &quot;And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.&quot;  Jesus says this several times.  He speaks in riddles so that only his followers (the elect?) will understand.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Luke 10:10-17 speaks of him healing on the sabbath which was unlawful but I want you to read and understand why he did it. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No, 10:10-17 speaks of Jesus stating that the cities which did not politely receive he and his disciples would be destroyed along with their inhabitants, even to the point of being &quot;thrust down to hell&quot; (10:15).  Jesus says that Sodom got better treatment than these cities will have (so much for &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; and &quot;turn the other cheek&quot;).<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Jesus also might I add was without sin.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Says you.  Personally, I find condemning entire populaces to damnation because they wouldn't politely receive subversive religious fanatics pretty despicable.  Jesus lies in John 7: 2-10. He tells his disciples he will not be attending the Feast of the Tabernacles in Jerusalem then later goes in secret.  Some biblical versions include &quot;yet&quot; or &quot;not yet.&quot;  These &quot;emendations&quot; are in place only to prevent Jesus from lying; they are not included in early scripture.  Jesus also demonstrates hypocracy in ways too numerous to add to this already long post.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Remember the woman who committed adultry and he said &quot;He who has no sin cast the first stone.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
She still commited adultery and should have been dealt with in accordance with the Law of Moses.  Nowhere in that law were provisions made regarding the moral status of the judges.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Luke 16:19-31 is a good parable concerning where you go when you die.&gt;&gt;<br>

The parable shows a rich man dying and heading to the torments of hell while a diseased beggar heads to heaven.  Primarily this parable shows the &quot;infinite love&quot; of God in action and the true theme of the Bible, found in almost every book: Obey or suffer.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Mark 13:10 is what proves that if you have not heard the gospel there is no way you can be held responsible if you have not heard. God gives everyone a chance my friends. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
13:10 just says &quot;And the gospel must first be published among all nations.&quot;  This doesn't prove much of anything, especially in light of other verses.  But let's look at a couple other things in mark 13.  13:20 tells us &quot;And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.&quot;  God chooses his elect beforehand (being omniscient). John Calvin loved verses like these, as they supported his belief in predestination.  Also, we have verse 30, &quot;Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.&quot;  This statement, that the end will come within the lifetimes of the disciples addressed by Jesus, is repeated elsewhere in the Gospels and by Paul.  Obviously, this prophecy hasn't come to pass (unless you're a preterist).  Apologists claim that &quot;generation&quot; (Grk, genea) somehow applies to the Jewish people, but this is not what the word means, and nowhere in the bible does genea stand for anything other than its common definition.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I will comment on the UN again. You all ever wonder why there is so much controversy in the Middle East? It's all in the gospels my friends the answers are in the bible itself.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;Controvery&quot; is not at all limited to the Middle East.  We happen to notice it more for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the tendency of certain very religious people to extirminate other people as a demonstration of faith.  Why is there so much controversy in Kashmir?  It's all in the Upanishads, my friends.<br>
<br>
Revelation, as previously mentioned, is open to all manner of interpretation.  However one is supposed to work out its meaning, I'm pretty sure that &quot;not using intellect&quot; is a poor method.  Daniel isn't any better.  It's easy to tie the images presented therein to empires contemporary to the 2nd century BC author (who attempted to write as the 6th c. BC Daniel, but didn't fare so well on the history).  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Lastly Romans 1:18-32 explains why everyone is held accountable for what they know. The first few verses 18 - 20&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Romans 1 is great.  If you ever want biblical support for the murder of homosexuals, here is what you've been looking for.  Verses 18-20 tell us that even those who don't receive the gospel are unexcused, since &quot;that which may be known of God is manifest in them.&quot;  Thus, ancient native americans had god in them, but are condemned to eternal hell because they chose not to pay attention.  &quot;For the wrath of God  is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men (1:1<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .&quot;<br>
<br>
If this were true, we would expect people with no contact to Judeo-Christian teachings to spontaneously develop beliefs strongly tied to those teachings.  This has never been shown to happen.<br>
<br>
Taking all of the above (and so much more) into account, i consider Christian theology deeply flawed, Christian beliefs morally bankrupt, and Jesus to be at best an average example of a good person (but with a great PR team).  Honestly, the best that Christianity has to offer is not original to Christianity, but was prevalent among societies saturated with Greek philosophy, such as the Gentile societies that were Luke's target audience.<br>

<br>
You actually are taking things way out of context here.  <br>
<br>
So you feel that the woman needed to be stoned if the law says she should be stoned.  Jesus once again came to fulfill the law so that we might have our sins forgiven.  My friend you are in fact guilty b/c the evidence of God is found in all places.  To a man in a jungle knowing of a creator but not knowing how to reach him &quot;Remember Acts&quot;  God had someone go to preach to him then he got baptised.<br>
<br>
Your human intellect won't get you there.  Can't earn your way into heaven nor buy your way into heaven.  You have to remember When was daniel written? and When was revelation written?  Both men saw the same creature and they have never met.<br>
<br>
Each gospel is written by diffrent people yet the compliment each other.  These days you can't get 4 people to do what they did and still be completly accurate.  My belief is the bible is the God breathed God inspired word of God without error.  I will continue to believe it.  <br>
<br>
In your lifetime I promise you shall see God's mighty hand move.  Actually my work here is just about done as far as posting goes I have given enough evidence and answered clearly.<br>
<br>
You have to understand that IF God right no wanted to wipe out America and everyone he would be just to do so b/c he is God and can do what he wants.  God is Holy bottom line.  <br>
<br>
The law was given so that we could see just how sinful we actually are.  There is no way any normal man could fullfill the law God had to fulfill it himself.<br>
<br>
Let me also point out that I haven't seen another other religious organization heal anyone at all.  Haven't heard of it or read it anywhere but the healing Jesus did is well documented in other places besides the bible.  <br>
<br>
So say what you must but I choose to trust God and believe that the word I have given to you can do 3 things.  Fall on the soil of your heart and grow.  If you have a harden heart as stone fall on the stone of it and Satan snatches it away so you don't get understanding.  Also could get lost in the thorns and weeds choke it out.<br>
<br>
I have no books to sell I am also not asking for money.  I have nothing to gain by typing here could have just looked and kept going but decided to reveal some things to ya.<br>
<br>
To comment on what you saw in Numbers here are some points remember I said you must have understanding.<br>
Why didn't you mention the rest of it in Luke.  It's Luke 6:1-11.  Read the whole thing that you might get understanding<br>
<br>
I am sorry I should have broken down Luke 8:18<br>
<br>
&quot;Becareful therfore how you listen.  For to him who has (Spiritual Knowledge) will more be given; and from hom who does not have (spiritual knowledge) even what he thinks and guesses and supposes that he has will be taken away.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is really broken down there that is actually very good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Also read Mark 10:1-12 that is a rich section when he is instructing on marriage and divorce.<br>
<br>
I do have Luke 10:10-17 incorrcet misplaced a scripture in my study notes sorry it was like 4 or 5am when I was typing some stuff.  I will search for another good example.<br>
<br>
Also to the comment that Jesus condemned my friends God always extends his love first.  God is Love yes but he is also a God of Justice.  He is God and can do what he wants when he wants.  You just fail to realize how hostile people were then.  People were so full of zeal you would be killed for preaching the Gospel.  The Roman Empire killed Christians much like Hitler killed Jews.  The Crusades was zeal and foolishness also.  They used religion as a cover up to have an excuse to lay to waste thousands.  Much like Islam does and is doing.  They believe America is the devil and ther ultimate goal is to wipe out Christianity that is hardcore truth.  <br>
<br>
I read articles on how Christians are killed in Islamic countries and how they are killed in China.  Just for holding a bible you can be executed actually you WILL be executed.  A woman selling pancakes to afford enough money to just get a bible to teach her family.<br>
<br>
More scripture here:<br>
<br>
Acts 8:26-40<br>
<br>
<br>
Also I hear alot of people saying &quot;Well you don't have to go to church you can just pray at home.&quot;  Try this one Hebrews 10:25<br>
<br>
Judgement 20:11-15<br>
<br>
As far as John 7 goes you still have to read and understand.  Read the ENTIRE chapter 8P then you will get the point.<br>
<br>
Lazarus was a begger and died of hunger b/c this rich man refused to feed him and didn't have compassion on that man.  Would you have feed the begger?<br>
<br>
Election or free will?<br>
<br>
Here goes don't get lost now.  God gives you the faith to believe in Him.  God knows who will believe and love Him if given a chance to believe.  Yes he knows that and still gives everyone a chance my friends.  Right now all who read this are getting a chance to a.Believe or b.Not Believe<br>
<br>
If it were that easy my friends God would just put a yellow stripe down the back of everyone who would believe and every preacher would just run down the streets and pull up shirts too see who is a saint or sinner.<br>
<br>
Once again you are misunderstanding what the man is saying in Romans.  I will just pray and hope you get an understanding before you leave this planet.  Might I say that mans knowledge is foolishness to God.  I agree.  Everything man touches becomes corrupt.  We have destoryed most of our planet polluted the sky and water.  We are the only thing on this planet wrong.  &quot;Entire nature screams for the day of redemption.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I will leave by saying this God is not here to ruin you but to help you become well rounded in all aspects of your life.  My friends God reserves the right to tell all of us how to live.  He is Holy God and reserves the right to do as we wishes.<br>
<br>
If you still refuse I have done my part.<br>
<br>
Love to all and Thormir my friend I feel you have some other issues to deal with in yourself.  Only God knows them.  He stands and knocks at the door and will only come in if you answer.<br>
