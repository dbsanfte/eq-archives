If you want to reach x figure of dmg over time why not increase manna regen instead?  Increasing the full burn dmg by a large amount would imply rebalancing high lvl encounters especially those with banable mobs.<br>
<br>
One problem you may see with that type of suggestion is the desire not to devalue the flowing joke items that are allready dropping off very high end mobs even if adding substantally better manna regen items in substantially easier encounters would be a good thing for class balance.<br>
<br>
If you do feel the need for clickable dmg items it would be of substantial benifit to you as a class and to the eq game world as a whole that these items not be usable below the lvl range they are intended to be used it.  <br>
<br>
Making them twinkable would simply lead to wizard twinks and greater inbalance vs non twinks especially in pvp. <br>
<br>
Currently the rogue class is besieged and diluted by a legion of twinks. Why? Because its easy to put a high lvl weapon in a low lvl rogues hand and do unbalanced dmg and lvl easily. Do you really want to see something similar happen to wizards if they were made a viable and desirable class in exp groups due to the changes you desire comming into being? Do you really want to hear discussions that go like &quot;My lvl 20 wizard roxors! he can nuke for 200 dmg with his rod of pwnage! No way man he suxors mine can do 300 with his kaboom uber stick!&quot;  Wait on second though maybe the kool doodz will stop playing their rogue twinks /cheer!<br>
<br>
Regarding &quot;up time&quot; a near 100% uptime group is quite possible. Example...<br>
<br>
Best exp group in my opinion is monk warrior rogue rogue enchanter cleric.<br>
<br>
How do you get near 100% uptime with this group? Simple.<br>
<br>
First you have a monk chain pull groups or single mobs as you prefer to the waiting group.  Chain pulling implies that the puller will leave to pull more mobs before the group finishes the current pull and will have the new mobs there shortly after the first pull takes a dirt nap.<br>
<br>
Your warrior gets on a target and taunts it.<br>
<br>
Rogues and monk assist the warrior.<br>
<br>
Enchanter mezes the rest then slows the target.<br>
<br>
Cleric Cheals as neccesary when the warrior drops down to 40% hp healing the warrior several thousand hp each time.<br>
<br>
Cleric clicks pog or velious quest legs if neccesary and if they have em when not chealing or medding. This is about a 100 group heal.<br>
<br>
Rogues and warrior click pog or velious quest bp between kills this is around a 90 hp heal every 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
Monk regens via fungi tunic, iksar regen (if applicable), mend, occasional celestial heals, coldain ring (if they have it) while pulling said monk should have run speed 3 allowing them to take very little dmg on the pull as they can outrun the mobs easily.<br>
<br>
Realize that almost all of the dmg taken here will be by a high lvl warrior tanking 1 70% slowed mob at a time and getting healed in an EXTREMELY effecient manner.  Then look at the fact that 60s can gain alt exp by killing high 40s mobs that are still dark blue and see how much downtime you have.<br>

I welcome feedback from all sources, even Rogues who play on PvP servers.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you want to reach x figure of dmg over time why not increase manna regen instead?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Increasing mana regen is also a reasonable solution. However, increased mana regen affects all spells (including snares and AE spells), while targeting the efficiency boost at DD spells allows for a more precise balanacing effort without unwanted side effects such as improving the ability of wizards to quad kite.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Increasing the full burn dmg by a large amount would imply rebalancing high lvl encounters especially those with banable mobs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Reducing mana cost for spells and adding right click nukes do not increase full burn damage rate at all. It would increase the effective mana pool of wizards when attacking a single target, but I'm not aware of this being a balance issue at the moment. If Banes become unbalanced, then it would be reasonable to leave the mana cost alone or give a smaller cut in cost than for other spells. For GB, however, agro is usually the limiting factor, and it's already close for DB on some of the longer fights, so I suspect that reducing the mana cost on these spells would have very little effect on the end game.<br>

Erm... right click items already work this way... They do not activate if the user is not of sufficient level. This is one of the main differences between melee twink items and caster twink items.<br>

The problem with twinks is very pervasive in EQ, and is not an easy one to solve. What we are striving for here is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> balance,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and for lower level wizards on mature servers, balance is sorely lacking, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> especially</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in the PvP realm.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Regarding &quot;up time&quot; a near 100% uptime group is quite possible. Example...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
While this is a decent plan, practical experience has shown that it does not attain 100% uptime. The highest single group uptime I've seen was around 70%, and it is more common for fast pull groups to achieve closer to 50% uptime. This came as quite a surprise to me as well, but the logs provided me with some surprising evidence (including how much action there was in a &quot;slow pull group&quot;). I would love to be proven wrong, and be supplied with a log from a single group of 6 where kill rate was anywhere close to 100%, but I haven't seen one yet.<br>
<br>
... but your illustration of the perfect single pull group helps to underscore our point:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Best exp group in my opinion is monk warrior rogue rogue enchanter cleric.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Why no wizard? The answer is well known, and is why wizards are in need of balancing: the Wizard will not be able to keep up with the pulls. Reducing mana cost of DDs and adding more right click nukes will help to address this issue and will at least make them viable. We are not asking to supplant rogues as the kings of sustainable damage (don't worry, your position is secure). We are just seeking some balance between melee classes and mana classes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uthediscoinferno.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The DiscoInferno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/15/02 11:57:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=188>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> instead of upping regen (which verant seems to loath the thought of) Why not just put in the damned focus items?

Btw as far as pvp on mature servers.  Low lvl wizards do quite well when not fighting twinks.  The practical solution for pvp twinking is to give weapons a lvl limit on a pvp server.  Every twink lvl 6 warrior with a lamentation would scream in anger but in in the end it would be a good change for pvp servers.<br>
<br>
I will log my next experience group, even if it isn't the best possible group I'm betting on more than 70% uptime.<br>
<br>
I believe whatever change is neccesary should be in the form of gear (as suggested by others before) rather than being handed out for free in keeping with the spirit of the game and balance between players.  Items that reduce the cost of evocation spells by a fixed percentage wouldn't be too bad.  Btw what sort of group should wizards be balanced in, the 30% uptime one or the 70% one?<br>
<br>
One more note on logging and comparing dmg.  If in the course of trying to achieve your best possible dmg you draw agro frequently you will not be taking an accurate log.  One problem I have with casters in general is agro especially when people have the badly mistaken idea that their expience bar matters in a raid setting.  This is what happens in a raid setting when a caster overnukes...<br>
<br>
All the rogues loss the chance to backstab until everyone repositions, this cuts their dmg by around 30%.<br>
<br>
All melees lose several rounds of melee while people find the  mob and engage again.<br>
<br>
The MA loses taunt and more importantly can no longer hit the mob till he finds it and engages it again resulting in even less agro on him and even more chance of the next nuke by anyone sending the mob running around after the caster.<br>
<br>
Basicly overagroing as a caster can be like casting an AE slow on your entire raid.  It's my impression that bad ping pong in a large group of people fighting player sized mobs cuts my dmg by at least 50-60%. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/16/02 2:54:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=192>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> One more note on logging and comparing dmg.

<br>
1.  That a wizard pushing his dps will draw aggro frequently.<br>
<br>
2.  A mob aggroed on a wizard automatically ping pongs.<br>
<br>
Good wizards on a raid will not draw aggro &quot;frequently&quot; and when he does, he'll either draw aggro just as the mob dies(often taking zero damage) or he'll be in melee range so the mob does not ping pong.<br>
<br>
Ping pong can be good sometimes too..<br>
<br>
The other people that are all trying to get xp are the melees, and will often conveniently ignore commands to reposition a mob getting dangerously far from the camp.  That's the time when you drag the mob to a good spot using aggro.<br>
<br>
Of course this doesn't work well on dragons and bosses and such... but honestly I've never had a problem with people trying to get xp on those mobs.  It's only the trash mobs that don't matter anyway that has everyone gunning for xp.  <br>

The only reason I bring it up is because I have encountered on several occaisions players that don't invite nukers into groups because they assume that nukers don't know how to control their aggro..  If you want to judge classes based on the worst common denominator player then what is the point?  Monks who don't wait for the call to assist.  Rogues who don't use evade.  Main tanks wielding a slow two handed weapon when they should be using high taunt weapons.<br>
<br>
I think that making a post that just assumes a bad wizards leads to more assumptions that wizards are generally bad players, and is one reason people don't invite them into groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujarnin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/5/02 4:24:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=195>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.interofficenetworks.com/demo/doh/jarninface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fixing wizards: my recommendations (long)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> players that don't invite nukers into groups because they assume that nukers don't know how to control their aggro.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now we get to the nitty gritty! I totally agree with this 100%. Every time I get into a &quot;discussion&quot; with a melee (doesn't matter which melee class) they always tell me that casters don't help exp groups. Reasons?<br>
<br>
1. Casters act like they have something to prove. They get into a group and start destroying everything pulled, and in a few minutes, they're either dead from aggro, or they're oom and medding through the next three or four pulls. <br>
<br>
2. Most exp groups want classes that have the least amount of downtime possible, because it increases the amount of exp gained over the same timeframe.<br>
<br>
3. Wizards don't contribute anything other than damage to a group. While that is a good thing, when it comes to casters, most melee-centric groups would like to have the &quot;utility&quot; spells that casters have. Since we're obviously the least utilitarian of the casters, we have nothing but our damage to offer.<br>
<br>
4. Most melee classes <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> hate</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to sit around waiting for a caster to say 'Full Mana' so they can kill something. In fact, I have heard horror stories of Melee lead groups which have disbanded casters as soon as they said OOM, and then invited them back when they have mana.<br>
<br>
In short, melee classes have held the reigns on exp grouping since Kunark came out. They don't like to take orders from casters. They don't like to wait for casters, and they tend to only include the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> essential casters</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in their groups.<br>
That is why we're more than welcome on Raids, and why we're shunned from normal exp pick-up groups. <p><center>

One problem I have with casters in general is agro especially when people have the badly mistaken idea that their expience bar matters in a raid setting. This is what happens in a raid setting when a caster overnukes...<br>
<br>
All the rogues loss the chance to backstab until everyone repositions, this cuts their dmg by around 30%.<br>
<br>
All melees lose several rounds of melee while people find the mob and engage again.<br>
<br>
The MA loses taunt and more importantly can no longer hit the mob till he finds it and engages it again resulting in even less agro on him and even more chance of the next nuke by anyone sending the mob running around after the caster.<br>
<br>
Basicly overagroing as a caster can be like casting an AE slow on your entire raid. It's my impression that bad ping pong in a large group of people fighting player sized mobs cuts my dmg by at least 50-60%. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I will admit it I have done this in a Raid setting.  With the exception of pinging the mob.  I have a real problem being on a 8 hour raid going after yet another melee weapon.  And not seeing exp at least, one an hour.  I have NEVER seen a melee switch weapons so that exp could be spread arcoss multi-groups on a raid.  Not every fight on a raid is a life and death situation.<br>
<br>
I am in a guild that raids every night.  I am very familar with the way a raid works.  Since we raid every night our Tanks, and Healers are leveling a lot faster than the rest of us esspecially the wizards.  Our wizards level 2-3 times slower than any Tank class.  The only way our Wizards/ Mages/ Necros level is through soloing. &lt;Yawn&gt;<br>

<br>
For my data points, I took several logs, mostly in Kunark and Velious. They can be found here:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessage?topicID=603.topic">pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffe...=603.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
I do not have data points for the various melee classes at all levels or equipment levels. What I did do is take values from logs of rogues at 51, 58, 59, and 60, and do a linear interpolation to cover the ranges where I did not have actual data (including most of the levels pre-50). At 60, I used 100dps, which is lower than some of the rogues on Safehouse are claiming, but was the value I measured with Benton, a 60 rogue from Triton while we were doing the Myconoid King camp. In order to account for haste, I cut this value by half, giving a raw dps of 50. I then added an estimate for proc damage at 8 dps at 60 (proc dmg estimate is 3 dps for 55-59). This gives an unaccelerated raw dps of 58 for a 60 rogue. Adding 100% haste (item + buffs) then doubles this to 116 dps. Again, this is lower than what some rogues have been claiming on Safehouse, but if anything my proc damage estimate is on the high side.<br>
<br>
If you have some logs you'd like to summarize and post to the above thread feel free, though I'm pretty much done with my research at this point, so I can't promise I'd incorporate the results -- though the spreadsheet is available so anyone with the desire is welcome to tweak it and make it better. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uthediscoinferno.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The DiscoInferno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/11/02 12:04:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=199>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.cdc.net/~mjunky/temp/mage.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Comment about raids</span><hr size=1> Focus items better not be +evoc and crap like that.

<br>
We don't make the people around us better.<br>
<br>
As a melee class, would you rather have the caster that can increase your ac and hp, speed your attacks, etc. allowing you to do YOUR job better, or the caster that does more damage than you?  Would you rather have the caster than can slow, debuff the mob, etc. allowing you to do YOUR job better, or the caster that does more damage than you?  Would you rather have the caster that can heal you, allowing you to do YOUR job better, or the caster that does more damage than you?  <br>
<br>
Everyone wants to shine, and grouping with classes that make YOU more effective is more fun.  Makes you feel more powerful, more important.<br>
<br>
I don't know if there's anything to this, but people tend to be a little selfish when looked at as a whole, and it seems plausible, in my opinion.<br>

<br>
I just finished reading all 10! pages to this thread, and I wanted to make a comment that may be useful in your arguement.<br>
<br>
First of all, I'm 100% in favor of right click nuke items. They very effeciently smooth out the DPS curve, while not being overpowering.  (assuming of course there are sensible lvl restrictions)<br>
<br>
The primary objection to this however, is that according to the &quot;Vision&quot; wizards are a burst damage class and not a sustained damage class.  As such, VI may reject any arguement that attempts to improve wizard sustained DPS.  They may argue that wizard balancing should only consists of tweaks to burst DPS.  I do not believe this is fair to the wizard class.<br>
<br>
Pre kunark, wizards were by far the masters of burst DPS.  And even today, wizards retain this title, but the margin by which they do has decreased considerably.  I'm not talking about druid/mage nukes here... I'm talking about burst melee DPS.  Consider things like duelist for rogues, and archery AAs for rangers, and it is clear that they can now do very significant burst DPS. A rog/ranger with top end gear and uber haste can pump out some very serious DPS in a short period of time.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not advocating that they nerf melee, but VI has allowed the roles of the classes to become blurred.  Melee can now do significant burst DPS, while mainting excellent sustained DPS.  All wizards are asking for is the same favor.  Wizards want to be masters of burst DPS, but also wish to do reasonable sustained DPS.  In my opinion, it is only fair for VI to consider this in light of the changes made to melee.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't think this particular arguement has been made before in this thread.  I am argueing that wizard sustained DPS should be raised, not because they need it to get xp groups, but because similar changes were made to melee in burst DPS (where they were weak) and now wizards want changes to sustained DPS (where they are weak).  In short the melee changes allowed melee to become weak wizards DPSwise, and now you are asking to become weak melee DPSwise.  Again, it seems only fair.<br>
<br>
Before I get flamed to death, let me say that I play an enchanter as my main.  I have played both mage (retired) and rogue (retired due to wrist injury).   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a> <b>10</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=648.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=648.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=202><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=648.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=648.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=648.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=648.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
