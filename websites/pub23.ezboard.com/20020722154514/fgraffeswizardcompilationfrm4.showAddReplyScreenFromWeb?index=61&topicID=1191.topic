Rhombus, Sam, Froz, etc. all believe their damage output is more than sufficient.  What's the point of &quot;balancing&quot; them?<br>
<br>
If caster balancing is intended to have any impact whatsoever (other than inspiring the current tableau of &quot;whiny lowbies&quot; vs. &quot;uber-in-blinders&quot;) it really should affect the group that has consitently complained: pre-60 wizards with average equipment.  As has been stated previously, it makes NO sense for a 50+ wizard to use pre-40 spells just to take advantage of level 2 focus.  <br>
<br>
Let me quickly restate something: no one is asking to be handed anything.  No one wants level 3 foci with uber stats dropping off orc pawns like candy, but is it really unreasonable to want 50+ camps with REASONABLE drop rates that can be done by one group and result in foci with crappy (or no) stats?  The uberguild cry for appropriate risk vs. reward would be satisfied and the casual gamer would gain a much-needed boost to group efficiency. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/upalaziousfrydaddy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Palazious Frydaddy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/8/02 3:14:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1191.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: well...</span><hr size=1> Thats kinda my observations about the caster balance.<br>
<br>
~Before Luclin Situation~<br>
<br>
60 Wizards w/ bells and whistles felt they didnt need balancing.  Nuke robes rock!<br>
<br>
&lt; 60 Wizard were the ones who needed an upgrade.<br>
<br>
~Luclin came out - NEW NUKES!!!~<br>
<br>
All I'm going to do is laugh at this one.<br>
<br>
~Luclin came out - Enter the FT Items ~<br>
<br>
60 Wizards w/ bells and whistles found that their crack team of 4-8 balanced groups could take on mobs and fill their satchels with FT Items.  Even get up to 19FT+ off of what they consider 'easy' encounters.<br>
<br>
&lt;60 wizards who could scrape up maybe 30 people to raid with, levels 50-60 could not do these encounters and where left with doing the Shawl quest for FT1 and later when Cazic Opened saw that there was some FT3 boots that was actually possible for them.  Out of those not in the tier1-2 guilds on my server I know of 2 60 wizards who have these.  Only seen one for sell....laff.<br>
<br>
Result: The 60 wizards w/bells and whistles grew stronger.  The Wizards who need the upgrade got little.<br>
<br>
~ Enter Mage Focus Items ~<br>
<br>
60 W/ all the bells and whistle are with mages handing these out from the moment they get on.  They'll always have a mage available. <br>
<br>
&lt;60 wizard - Seeks out Mage.  Hopes the mage decides to play in their guild that day so they have these items.  Or is force to 'create a corpse' every time they log to save the items.  Hell, I'm level 60 in a guild who at optimum raid time might have 35 54-60 level members on.  Several times we raid without mage items for the simple fact is one of our 4 mages arent on.<br>
<br>
~Result~<br>
<br>
60 Wizards w/ bells and whistles became even more powerful.<br>
<br>
&lt;60 Wizards became more powerful if they were lucky or decided to go beg for mage items. /shrug I don't feel like I should beg to help balance me.<br>
<br>
~Enter Focus Items ~<br>
<br>
8 items that TRULY will help balance us... the damage/mana items.  Ya, its nice to save portal fragments.  Ya, its nice to cast faster... but to balance us we need 'more damage' and 'mana efficiency'.<br>
<br>
2 of the 4 damage items are CoV faction.  There are 3 guilds on our server who are capable of these encounters and dont have to worry about faction any more...maybe 20 wizards total, if that. I'm sure they have them already.  1 of the items requires a drop from Gore. Our guild is almost capable of gore.. just lacking a few more damage dealers, havent seen one yet though. The last is out of Cazic, probably by far the most obtainable.  I love this zone, spend a lot of time there... still dont have a cap tho. =p<br>
Pretty much have to be level 60 to succeed in here tho so not obtainable for the 44-55 crowd.<br>
<br>
~Net Result on Damage Focus~<br>
<br>
60 Wizards w/ bells and whistles log on to find stuff from their last ToV raid having Damage3 or maybe they wont destroy that item the next time they visit their. They will gain more from this.<br>
<br>
&lt;60 wizards will see some of the 60 wizards getting the cazic drop and even a couple (55-60 ) might see the hide from gore and will be able to do the quest...doesnt do much for the 44-55 crowd at all tho. Some will gain.<br>
<br>
~Net Result on Mana Focus~<br>
<br>
I dont see a problem with most wizards being able to obtain this.  Would have been better to see this on a good piece of equiptment or even thurg quest armor if its to benefit the 44-60 crowd.  Tie =p<br>
<br>
**Total net result**<br>
<br>
The 20-30 wizards in the guilds that can do the high-end encounters have benefited from all these upgrades.  Hell, its easy for them, just ask them.  So the group of wizards who didnt need the upgrade recieved all of them making them more powerful and set back from the fact that for a lot of wizards the gap widens.  Melee upgrades still drop like candy and are easily passed down.  Even reavers - 40/40 ratio are 10-15k on our server and dropping making it obtainable by the mid-40s melees, let alone younger wizards having to compete with this kind of damage.<br>
<br>
The &lt; 60 or 60 wizards like myself pretty much are relying on the mage items for balance.  Some might have up to FT4 and some might have the mana regen focus.  The caster balance has pretty much missed the 44-59-low 60 crowd.<br>
<br>
Yes, lots of wizards come here to vent their frustration at the lack of the caster balance.  <br>
<br>
Look at the numbers on Armok's chart.  The only item that will raise the bar might be the mage focus items... and wizards wont always have them available.  Meanwhile the high-end wizards power has grown a lot... I'm sure that when he runs the numbers and re-graphs the chart this will be obvious.<br>
<br>
Yes, the vents sometimes become out of control a bit.  Hell, these wizards that need the balancing have pretty much been shit on.  They come here to vent and are told 'your a newb' or 'you suck' or the 'burrower is easy and any gimp guild can do it'...<br>
<br>
..and my favorite, work harder so you can join a tier one guild and get this stuff.. you dont work hard enough and therefore don't deserve this.<br>
<br>
Hell, you want the easy way? Join a tier one guild.  It works...hell, my best friend did just that.  Of course, most encounters are so easy that it doesnt matter if she nukes or not, it won't make any difference in the outcome of the fight.<br>
<br>
Hell, she's bored to death because not much is a challenge anymore.  She's even quit playing most of the time because of this and yet has far better equipment then those who spend much more time then her seeing if they can take the next level of mobs.<br>
<br>
This is working hard to 'earn' your items? Laff..<br>
<br>
Maybe those who were in on the first floor when the guild started and worked their ass off to get it to tier one deserve the 'work hard' plaque.  And believe me... these people have my utmost respect and always will.<br>
<br>
But joining a tier one guild has nothing to with working hard at all....just the opposite.<br>
<br>
To those people who are in the 44- &lt; 60 range, they have recieved little, no matter how much work they put in.<br>
<br>
To those people who are in the tier one guilds, grats on the bonus.<br>
<br>
But take the time to listen to your younger piers and those who are not in the tier one guild.  These should be the people that the Rombus's are looking out for.<br>
<br>
If that doesn't happen then there will continue to be a widening gap in the war against the select few and the masses.<br>
<br>
Something that is happening to a greater extent everytime we come to the boards.<br>
<br>
After talking with a lot of fellow wizards on my server I have really good stuff.  Full ToV armor, epic, level 60, 7th shawl, 255 int, plenty of mana, etc. No sunstrike though despite 5 months of active auctioning, killing mass guardians in SF, dragons, checking with the local MB team on a weekly basis, enough Protectors to get dizzy.<br>
<br>
On raids I rock pretty well, In an exp group with c3 and bard I rock pretty well.  If these arent available at the time my damage output dives to an embarrassing level, especially in a fast pull group.  Hell, if I have to use fire then my damage isnt much better then level 51 when I got draught of fire. lol<br>

And it's a blast watching it grow, keeping everyone happy before they jump ship to a tier 1 guild, etc.<br>
<br>
We do get a lot of help from the tier 1 guilds on our server as they are always there for advice, rooting you on, or even letting you tag along to experience a mob so you can take that knowledge back to your guild.<br>
<br>
So I would say on quellious we are very lucky to have this.<br>
<br>
And I do learn some from the Rombus's on this board, even when they rant sometimes, about the progressions and direction to take the guild.<br>
<br>
I just wish the focus was on this rather then a constant fight in most of the threads.<br>
<br>
And this is where the Rombus's could really show their knowledge and assist younger wizards in playing a better game.<br>
<br>
Besides, we all know that wizards make the best leaders <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Namely the Kunark dragon type mobs, as we need to get good at these before we can move to the vindi/velks type mobs.<br>
<br>
But these kinda mobs are very scarce and usually not up during the time that we have our 35 raiders on.<br>

They do not help casters that really need more power to be more balanced.<br>
<br>
The only conclusion possible is that they were not ment to be part of caster balancing.<br>
They are only intended to make loot more interesting for casters that can get them.<br>
<br>
This only becomes a problem if perhaps a lv58 caster complains about not being powerful enough and that he cant do enough dmg in groups.<br>
If someone mentions the items upgraded in last patch and tells him that it´s possible for him to be more powerful now.<br>
Then that person is a complete idiot.<br>
<br>
The worst possible situation would of course be if VI includes these items when they look at the power of casters like him and decides how much improvement is needed to balance them.<br>

I'm not uber and not even &quot;technicaly&quot; in a guild. I've read every post you made too. I understand exactly what your saying because I've read it before. yes, the same arguments happened on Stormhammer when players (like you) didnt get vulak loot off orc pawns and then left the server (kinda like you leaving your wiz) crying how lousy the server was.  you see, they realized they still had to work for loot and /gasp it was harder now since there was no spoiler site to tell them what to do.<br>
<br>
you dont want to do ntov but think you still deserve the loot right? You deserve nothing. VI owes you nothing for 12.95 or 39.95. All they do is provide the oppertunity to you. You make those choices on what lvl you play and where you raid. do not blame anyone else for your choices like you are doing to us.<br>
<br>
youre acting like a whinny, spoiled, premadonna. You need to get a clue that this (focus items thing) is not done. additionaly, get off your &quot;I deserve it&quot; high horse and realize that you still have to work for your drops.<br>
<br>
guess what? I dont even wear the lvl3 effect items I have. Why? they are crap, they sat in the bank for a reason and some cheesy effect of summoning 3 or range 3 is not going to make me pull them out.<br>
<br>
I will never spend 40k plat for a spider fur cap when I can bum a focus bracer for free on a raid. I will never spend 50k plat on a Oblus death shroud. why? Its not worth it and the foci are not the end all be all.<br>
<br>
btw, how many times are you going to leave Gor? <p><br><br>
