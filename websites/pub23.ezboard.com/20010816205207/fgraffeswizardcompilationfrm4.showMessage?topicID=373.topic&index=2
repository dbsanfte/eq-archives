<br>
I agree...<br>
<br>
that over whining is annoying.<br>
that complaint after complaint can be counterproductive.<br>
<br>
I disagree...<br>
<br>
that VI has done more for us.  It is simply not true.   Stacking issues were game wide.  Adding more ports and transes isn't what I call doing more for us.  Adding enhancements that truly don't effect the sub-uber game that greatly was more because so many were obtaining level 60 than it was for class balancing.  And that was straight from Alans mouth at the Baltimore Fan Faire.  I'm not going to flame them.  I'm simply disappointed.  Thats all.  Hasn't stopped me from playing... yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, the complaints are annoying.  But it is more because of HOW they are presented than WHEN or HOW OFTEN they are presented.<br>

<br>
I've enjoyed the class from day one.  My melee friends absolutely hate the fact that they can't travel, can't solo even a green mob without sitting forever afterward (or dying outright), can't escape a bad situation without sow, or do much of anything without a group.  The ability to do these things is a wonderful thing indeed.  <br>
<br>
So we can't find an experience group...big deal.  Single pull, no-risk, no-excitement groups are something that I yearn for? Not hardly.  There is nothing so pleasing as going into a place like Mistmoore the other night and seeing 2 or 3 supernova's going off at the same time and laying waste to the entire area.  <br>
<br>
Let the melee's have their single pull groups.  Nothing more exciting than turning auto attack on, and rotating clicks of taunt, bash, kick and disarm for hours.  Or sitting all night and clicking a healing spell every so often.  Yummy!  I'd rather have the pullers message be something like &quot;oooh this is one BIG pull...lock and load!&quot;  Or I'd rather have the challenge of pulling off a nice quad-kite, even considering the medding involved.  <br>

<br>
i guess what i was trying to sum up in the first post was this:<br>
on what basis do you think we as wizards are getting screwed?  where is it written that wizards have to have X ability to be a &quot;wizard&quot;?  can't VI make them as they see fit?  i mean come on, its their game.  can't they make it the way they want?  its a free country.  they put a product in front of us and if we like it, we buy it.  if we don't, we simply but it back on the shelf and choose another.<br>
<br>
Everquest is a game that YOU went to the store and bought for $29.95.  its not a freakin brand new car that has a warranty stating that if you aren't satisfied you had the right to demand service.  VI made no promises to anyone playing this game nor will it ever do so.  do you have the option to make suggestions?  sure.  but the attitude i notice from a lot of players after reading these boards for almost 2 years is that we can demand that they &quot;fix&quot; us and if they don't, they are stealing our money.  it's like you think Verant &quot;owes&quot; us something.  its so funny to see the responses after they change something.  i think some people are actually outraged and really get pissed of in real life.  <br>
<br>
i find it humorous.<br>

Anyway, EQ is this: get a mob00, hit it for x dmg, loot mob. Be that on your own, with a group or with collection of raid groups. Thats it. Sounds boring eh? Depends what flicks your switch.<br>
<br>
Forget this talk of 'well if you cant get a group, go an solo' shit. We dont want to hear it, we dont care, people like you just dont fucking understand one little bit. You miss the point. People may not want to solo, the fact that we can is irrelevant. You need to get this into your thick skull.<br>
<br>
So EQ is doing that, but talking to people (as a wizard, you must be the most socialable people in EQ with our fucking downtime), and therefore the social aspect is pretty much top of the list. If you play to solo because you dont have much time, respect to you. If you play to solo because you want to solo 8 hrs a day to get your level for weeks on end, you must be the kind of person who is on wave 50 of gems by now.<br>

These people (Verant) poured their souls into this game.  They got lucky and it became a huge success.  They have learned a LOT since they made the game.  They constantly make improvements.  They constantly try to balance the game.  They love this game as much as we do!  And most important, they did something they believed in and were rewarded for it.<br>
<br>
Now they can continue that success with more financial backing.  More experience.  More and more players giving their insight so that Verant can make the game better.<br>
<br>
We'd all be FOOLS not to open discussions with Verant when we disagree with something.  They want and crave our input.  Do you think they need the developers corner?  Hell no.  We'd all still be playing.  and we'd all still be paying.<br>
<br>
The idiots are the ones who think that Verant is out to get us.  That they hate the wizard class.  (how the hell does anyone even think that's possible??)  Get a damn clue.<br>
<br>
To the people who criticize Verant.. Good for you!  If you disagree with something, let them know!  Its when you get overly upset about it that the problems arise.  These forums are here to discuss things like that.  These forums are here for wizards to &quot;talk shop&quot;.<br>
<br>
Who is the idiot who decided that lv 60 wizards are the LEAST qualified to talk about the lower level game?  The pioneers of this game made it a hundred times better for you.  It used to be that lower level wizards came here for advice, and it still happens.  But some of you think that the old timers aren't qualified to talk about any portion of the game??<br>
<br>
There are a FEW situations that lower level players are truly not *qualified* to discuss portions of the end game.  Yet they get their panties in a bunch if its mentioned.  Its like your parents probably told you.  &quot;you'll understand when you are older&quot;.  Deal with it.  Don't get all self-righteous when someone disagrees with you!  That is what we're here for.  To spread different viewpoints and ideas!!<br>

<br>
I am not sure how you came to the conclusion anyone even hinted at this.  No one has remotely implied that they are the least qualifed, only that being level 60 and in an uberguild, raiding all the time changes your perception of the game and Wizards, and you tend to forget the past.  That's all true, doesn't mean you are an idiot or a monster, just human.<br>
<br>
I'd be hesitant calling level 60 characters pioneers.  Some of the may well be, but something to remember is that I met level 50 characters back when I was level 20 who'd never put anything into specialization.  I met a level 44 Druid who never trained Chanelling.  There are a lot of upper 50s characters that haven't been to many zones in the game and have no clue what to do in them or where to go.  Being x level doesn't make you guaranteed to be a scholar or an expert in anything.  It just guarantees you are either good at getting levels or have a hell of a lot of free time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg BORDER=0> at: 8/3/01 6:43:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uloxinius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loxinius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/2/01 11:27:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sick to death of the whiners !!!!</span><hr size=1> I think its a good thing that people disagree.

are completely entitled to do so...but theyre not going to change how i play EQ as a wizard. I'm not going to change my mind about my class cause i read somewhere on a board that &quot;our mana efficiency, blah blah, sucks, bad, no&quot; Not bringin me down any. <br>
<br>
Hey, but if some fellow wizards think some things need to be changed, more power to them.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Why else would i be here if i didnt give two shits about the wizard community? Good to hear the debate.<br>
<br>
Still, nobodys gonna tell me how to play Eq, (within the boundaries of the game itself, hehe) whatever really. <br>

<br>
Yes, they raid a lot.  But, guess what?  They had to get lv 60 too.  And that requires a lot of grouping and xp hunting.  Sometimes you get in a &quot;guild group&quot;, sometimes (more often for a lot) you get in a pickup group.  We face the same damn things you do every single day.  And I'm sick to death of you trying to convince us otherwise.<br>
<br>
You have this idea that an &quot;uber&quot; guild makes you somehow more special than everyone else.  That amazing loots are just handed to you.  Mobs yield and hand over their loot at the sight of an uber guild.  You (those who share this perspective), are the ones who are grossly misinformed/deluded. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uledgrok.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ledgrok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/3/01 7:53:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sick to death of the whiners !!!!</span><hr size=1> I've quit whining...<br>

As for being negitive...well let me compare my various characters...<br>

level 49 Wizard - approx 1.5 months play time.<br>
level 40 Druid - approx 3.5 weeks play time<br>
level 31 Ranger - approx 3 weeks play time<br>
level 13 Monk - approx 36 hours play time.<br>
<br>
Each gets about the same play time per week, I started my Wizard first, yet my othere chars are advancing MUCH faster...I'm the same person playing all the chars...but my Wizard levels MUCH more slowly...<br>
<br>
This is fact, not some fool blowing off steam.<br>

Hey nonny nonny and a hootie hoo.<br>
<br>
Verant has said over and over that GROUPING is the main focus of the game.  They've made changes to the game and to classes themselves to discourage soloing.<br>
<br>
Sorry if you don't like the whining.  People do enjoy their wizards and want to play them.  But they get bitchy when they can't get a group and can't solo without bumming SOWs or camping jboots.  It's always been like this and Verant hasn't done a damn thing to change it.<br>
