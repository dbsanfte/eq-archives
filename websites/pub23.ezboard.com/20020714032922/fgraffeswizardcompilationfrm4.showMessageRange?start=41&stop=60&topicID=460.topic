Actually Grim, <br>
It is a word that reflects an exact meaning.<br>
Most of us who are very secure in our own sexuality know that any &quot;straight&quot; man or woman who is Homophobic, is either A) simply uneducated, or B) in the closet/denial....Afraid of something, indeed, like themselves.<br>
<br>
In my experience, Most people are not as &quot;uneducated&quot;  (About this topic at least) as they would like you to believe them to be.  You’d be surprised (or not) at the number of people who use stupidity as a smokescreen.<br>

<br>
I find it amusing that someone objects to 'gay' being used in a derogatory fashion. At least the person, in referring to the behavior of the terrorists, didn't say, &quot;that's so queer.&quot; Queer used to mean strange, bizarre, or weird (IMO, an accurate description of homosexual appetites, but I digress.) It became a derogatory term for practitioners of homosexual behavior, so they tried to adopt gay (which, to my view, promotes the effeminate stereotype I would think undesirable.) So why did 'gay' take on the derogatory meaning that 'queer' used to have? Could it be that people instinctively recognize the behavior as something abberant? <br>
The attempt to label anyone who disagrees with the opinion that homosexual appetites are healthy as afraid is not a new tactic. The Soviets used to put people in mental hospitals for opposing the government, on the presumption that because they were so right and good, anyone who disagreed with them *had* to be insane. <br>
While some are offended at 'gay' being used as a derogatory term, I object to the phrase, 'gay man', as being an oxymoron. Manhood is a status of virtue that not all human males attain, and homosexual appetites precludes someone who embraces them from earning the label &quot;man&quot;. But of course, as I'm not a member of a protected group, I can just go be offended. I've yet to figure out why it's so terrible to offend one group, but not terrible to offend another.<br>
There was a tale that a man rode the WTC down and survived. Not true. There was a tale that a Bible was found in the Pentagon, unburned. Not true. There have been many other such tales surrounding the tragedy, most all of which have been discounted. Likewise, just because someone says one of the people who fought the hijackers had homosexual appetites doesn't make it so.<br>
Homosexuality is a mental abberation. To call alcoholism &quot;an alternate lifestyle&quot; may make a drunk feel better, but it doesn't cure his problem. It does people with homosexual appetites an injustice to say the same thing about them, and thereby deny them the opportunity for treatment.<br>
Sex is the first drug addiction. It's extremely powerful, as demonstrated by the insane things people will go through in order to achieve their 'high'. The addiction exists to ensure the proliferation of the species. Unfortunately, it leaves one open to other addictions as well (such as heroin, tobacco, etc.) As the purpose of this addiction is to get females pregnant, if the only thing that arouses you is members of the same sex, or squirrels, or oak trees, or Klingons, you have an abberation. Certainly impotence is regarded as either a mental or physical disorder. Likewise, misdirected sexual attraction should be as well. The only time people should be denegrated for this is when they insist they don't have a problem. <br>

<br>
As far as I'm concerned the whole political correctness has gone way too far.  To call someone a biggot because they used a term that you don't agree with in a completly different context than what would normally be considered offensive is just kind of silly IMHO.<br>
<br>
It reminds me of the congressman last year who got forced out of office for using the word 'niggardly' in a speech.  He used it in its proper context and the word itself has no racial connotation (other than the fact it sounds like 'nigger').  People took offense and he ended up resigning.<br>
<br>
Has our country really come to the point where we have to watch everything we say/type so as not to offend someone?<br>
<br>
I can understand the way you feel about the word and how it has been used to refer negativly to homosexuals but shouldn't the context of discussion be taken into account? <p><P></P>

This word has INTENTIONALLY been designed, along with a psychological campaign of sorts, to engineer society to a certain point where once the general society saw you as sick or wierd for being homosexual, to now you are viewed as sick or wierd for thinking it's wrong.  If the latter is the way things should be, then it would be a strong enough case without using tricks like this.<br>
<br>
Think back, when you were told that people who dislike homosexuality were, in fact afraid of it and themselves and were likely gay themselves... was there any proof?  Any demonstration of scientific study?  Or was it just stated with official air and assumed authority (with lots of clapping in the Oprah crowd)?<br>
<br>
All I want is for people to think more deeply about this and other things, not to buy what they are spoon fed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uhiraghm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hiraghm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/3/01 10:18:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=460.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.com/jdwilliams2/data/Aldrinshroom1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Maultar's display of similar bigotry</span><hr size=1> I never suggested those afflicted with sexual disorders require confinement to a mental hospital. But obviously they need help to one degree or another. Would you tell a person suffering from depression, &quot;okay, either check into Bellevue, or claim an 'alternate lifestyle'.&quot; Once upon a time it was claimed that alcoholism had a genetic component (just as has been claimed about homosexuality.) So does diabetes. Should we just let diabetics die, rather than offend them by saying they need to see a doctor and take medicine?<br>
<br>
I'm amused whenever I see a reference on television or in the movies, where heterosexual guys are looking at well-built females, and the interest is somehow turned toward oral sex. Frankly, I don't see why anyone would want oral sex from someone who *has* a vagina. But, then again, we are dealing with an addiction. Logic isn't in operation.<br>

The APA has done a lot of damage to the U.S. over the years. Shakespeare had it right, but didn't go far enough. &quot;First, kill all the lawyers.&quot; ... Second, take out the psychiatrists and insurance brokers.<br>

<br>
uuuummmm........ since when is being homosexual something that can be treated?  You live in a fantasy world, step into reality for a second.  99.9% of homosexuals are that way not because of choice.  It's not a sickness or illness that requires treatment.  You're having mental images of shock therapy to snap a homosexual back to heterosexuality.  You are so wrong!   Why is it that your lifestyle is right and the other is wrong?  <br>
<br>
Living in the city is wrong because I live in the suburbs and there's less crime in teh suburbs, the air is cleaner, children are safer, there's less polution, etc.  You should all buy houses in the suburbs.  Isn't that silly?  Well, you're saying the same thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uphaedran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phaedran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/3/01 10:52:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=460.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Maultar's display of similar bigotry</span><hr size=1> Ok, Hira, test out your theory.....waltz into a  gay bar and announce to the patrons that you are there to help them get treatment for their affliction.

<br>
And your confusing the word 'addiction' with 'desire' which the analagous to the difference between obsession and interest.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=460.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=460.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=460.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=460.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=460.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=460.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=460.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=460.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=460.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=460.topic&start=201&stop=205>11</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=460.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=460.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=460.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=460.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=460.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=460.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=460.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
