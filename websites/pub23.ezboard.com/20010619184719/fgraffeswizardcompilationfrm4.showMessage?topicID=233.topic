Not that VI cares or even  most Wizards, but I have come to more than a few realizations.<br>
<br>
EQ is a melee based game. The game revolves around the Warrior. In order to make yourself more useful, you MUST be able to assist them. You must have utility. Who cares if we evac? Druids do it as well and they have utility to heal, buff, regen, blah, blah, balh. <br>
<br>
Yes, AOE groups are neato, we rule. I have lived most of my pathetic wizard life Aoe'ing. But do we do it well without help, like jboots, no. Do you get your epic by quad kiting, no.  But be honest, the best, most challenging things in the game are in Dungeons, period. Where are AOE groups there, unless there is a pathing problem?<br>
<br>
Lures are a slap in the face. They do nothing than make us less efficient casters, reducing our utility. GREAT! I can hit mobs with my lures, after 2k of damage is dealt, I am oom. Plus, I have been summoned 5 times.<br>
<br>
We have broken spell lines, like Al'Kabor, Fade, Eye, Pet, the list goes on and on. And what does VI do to fix it? Nothing. <br>
<br>
What do Wizards do to fix them? Nothing. We sit around and nit pick about how these spells have a use in the most limited of situations. <br>
<br>
I have said it before, and I will say it again, this game is all about efficiency. Why bother doing a lame quest for a crappy pet? Don't waste your time. You know how many Wizards I see having pets? Fookin ZERO. Why? Becasue it isn't worth their time. Why would a guild give a crap about helping you with your epic when cleric's are much more useful. Correct me if I am wrong, but Our Epic is self only. How shitty is that? <br>
<br>
What do we do better than anyone else, without a shadow of a doubt? NOTHING. What utility do we have? Hmmm, lemme think. We can invis folks, one by one. We can cast a 5 pt stackable damage shield, we can evac. We can cast see invis. We can snare (AE). I am not saying we need utility, but for the love of HESUS, make us group friendly! Hell, make concussion cast instantly and be unresistable or freakin something. SOMETHING!<br>
<br>
Hell, I could go on and on, being flame bait, but bottom line is that Wizards are the bottom of the barrel in any situation except when folks need a ride, and even then, if they need a sow, they're going to a Druid.<br>
<br>
You know what? I know people will include miniscule things we can do  just because that's the way Wizards play. We fight for scraps. I wish we could just come together in protest, but we won't. Why do you all keep taking this crap? Mainly, because we are greedy and hooked on EQ.<br>
<br>
I feel like I have wasted my time as a Wizard. I feel like we, as Wizards keep letting VI slap us in the face with lame ass things like Bane spells, that you have to quest for (not worth it, again), that only 1 fookin level in the game can use. They make us numb by giving lures, I hate lures. It just shows our ineptitude. Our damage does not go up signifigantly from 51 to 59.  Our pluses do not weigh up to our minuses, PERIOD, DOT!<br>
<br>
Until we all come to some sort of agreement, status quo will remain constant. Our spells will remain broken and we will continue to increase posts on Graffe's OOM Forum. Try finding another class who has a thread for retiring folks.<br>

What can we possibly do?<br>
I am experiencing the same thing you are. I sign on for a few hours a week anymore and become so discusted that my EQ jones is cured for a while. Then I log off and do something else. I really like this game and will not delete my account, really just because I want to see what happens with the game. Maybe, down the road, in an alternate reality, things will get better and I could become a full time EQ freak again. As it stands now, EQ is called &quot;Ever-bad-taste-in-my-mouth&quot;.<br>
The only way that I ever see this game changing is if all the INT casters (because we all have problems. Except maybe enchanters) create a mele and use it as our primary. How likely is that? But I am sure if that happened (everybody played mele) VI might want the caster classes to look more attractive. I personally will not develop another character on EQ because my wizard is my first and my main and what I wanted to play in the first place. There is no way that I am spending the time developing another class only to find out it sucks too (even though I have a low level shaman and monk I enjoy I will never get them up to the level of my wizard).<br>
When VI closed down their message boards without addressing any issues raised and then changed our class description, I realized that the players are powerless and unheard. Even if they do not agree with the problems raised by players, I just cannot stand the way they treat us... it is just dead air. Talking to VI is like talking to a wall. This is what I mean when I say &quot;what can we, as players, do?&quot; I hope they they are listening to Graffe and maybe other wizards ideas but VI has done nothing to make me really believe it will get better. Still, I hope. I have had fun I admit, and I hope I will again.<br>
Well, anyways, I still enjoy coming here a few times a week to read the news and see what is happening.

Wizards individually may not seem to add a lot of damage, but multiple wizards casting even lures will do a serious amount of damage on a mob in a short period of time.  For melees, you may say that the following is true for how effective the class is:<br>
<br>
Warrior:<br>
1=1<br>
2=2.1<br>
3=3.3<br>
4=4.5<br>
5=5.9<br>
6=7<br>
<br>
Very straight forward, there's a bit of extra functionality to a melee class, where being able to balance things between them will help, but in general, it's linear.  Now, how I see the wizard class:<br>
<br>
1=0.9<br>
2=2.2<br>
3=3.9<br>
4=5.5<br>
5=6.9<br>
6=8.4<br>
<br>
The more wizards, the faster the mobs go down, to the point where they can't do much damage before they go down in a well coordinated group.  As always, uber-HP mobs in Velious reduce how useful 8 people are against a single mob since you can't burn the mobs down quickly enough, but in general, we gain more power in numbers as we work together.  It's just the weird way the game is designed that lets this happen, but in a 3 second period, 6 level 56 wizards casting draught will do 4008 damage in 3 seconds with no resists.  That can't be matched by six level 56 melees.  Even if the mob goes after one of the wizards, there's still five wizards left casting, so add 3340 damage to the mob, and if there are clerics around, that first wizard may still be up, so again, add 3340.  <br>
<br>
With the exception of the high high level zones where the mobs have 32k HP, you've just done 10680 damage in 12 seconds to a mob if there are no resists.  This doesn't even take 20 percent of the mana pool of the wizards either.  But, this power is to take things down quick, if a single wizards chaincasts a bar of mana, he/she still won't do near this ammount of damage because of agro.<br>
<br>
In spite of this power, in a single group situation with only one wizard, we still need some work, but we also have a VERY solid amount of power at level 55+.  Without too much effort, at 56 you should be able to cast 13 draughts on a full bar of mana.  That includes things like Carmine, but doesn't include most of the new Velious items.  So, show your power if you've made it to level 55, because you DO have a good amount, you just need to realize it.<br>

Hard to find a good supply of victims in outdoor regions.  You should have an area that has about 20-25 spawns in it.  Guk, Seb, Karnor's, HS, CoM are all really good for this.  Give it a try, see if you still hate playing a wiz.  <br>
<br>
Waiting on VI to fix the class isn't very fun.  The changes come very slow and no ammount of yipping at them seems to help.  I've seen really good petitions with hundreds of player signatures be tossed out without so much as a line of explanation.  Hard to get excited when VI makes a promise to fix us...heh.  If you don't like the class, try another.  The secret is to have fun playing, so if you're not having fun, change something.  Change playstyle, class, even games, but have fun.  This is your hobby, you should enjoy it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uoglzogl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>oglzogl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/27/01 6:38:15 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.toddpowelson.com/selfish.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Read and Flame.</span><hr size=1> Point well taken Beryl. However, after 100+ days of doing something I am sure you understand that something is expected in return for your troubles. As it stands now I am just not sure what the return is. We were told we can expect to gain incredible power as we age which makes up for our weak start. My experience has taught me this simply is not true. And it isn't class envy or pet envy (Freud would have a field day with that term) but simply that I think the wizard class is broken (I don't think they are as broken as some people do. I do think they.. we.. are broken however). Maybe there are better wizards than me out there who dispute this.. big damn deal.<br>
I realize this really isn't the place to accomplish anything as far as changing the game goes but hey, this is a rant board after all. <br>
