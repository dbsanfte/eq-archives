<br>
Instead of pets....wizards have always been portrayed to have wizard familiars. (ie cats, birds, rats, etc)  Why not a wizard familiar?...it wouldn't be used for battle nor could it be controlled like a pet.  What it COULD be used for is to complement our line of spells when it's next to us. (ie.  act as a small mana battery, or perhaps give us some added resistances while it's around). <br>
<br>
VI wouldn't even need to remodel anything... a bixie model or a miniature tiger could maybe serve as a familiar.  <br>

They should start around maybe lvl 24 with say a frog with gives endure breath and improved swimming skill(not much but still something that could be put to good use esp for the ice comet/staff of the wheel quest).

Maybe this is the possible advance we are all looking for.  considering a Enchanter can create a sword pet for their use.  And a Mage, Cleric, necro can make pets as well.  Why are we the onyl left pure casters left out?  I strongly promote this idea. I had somthing of the sort along time and hoped it would happen in Kunark. <br>
Although with the new working of spells we'd have to kill a god to get a 10th level pet.  And kill 10 of them and take their skin to some gnome to get a 12th lvl one.=) *BAH*<br>

<br>
One concept for the wizard familiar - <br>
<br>
A high mana cost quote unquote &quot;pet&quot; (As in using 50% to 60% mana to cast), familiar stays with you upon zoning/logging (easy to work out with code, spell acts as a buff, if you zone/log in and buff is on, it checks for a familiar and if one isn't there it creates one).  Familiar then bestows whatever advantages that particular familiar should give, (including increased mana regen which I think should be standard, and the regen would be balanced by the initial casting cost and the risk of losing familiar).  Also the wizard should be able to switch between looking through the familiar's eyes and his own. (Might require an additional spell to implement this aspect, don't know how else it could be coded).<br>
<br>
If the familiar dies, caster takes certain amount of damage and loses a certain amount of mana from the system shock of losing it (familiars are mentally connected to their masters).<br>
<br>
If the familiar has any offensive ability at all, it should be magical in nature only (a familiar that casts a MR debuff would be pretty cool) and it's abilities could be set to go off when it's master goes into &quot;attack mode&quot;<br>
<br>
What's really neat about this is that the familiar's abilities could be tweaked and worked with to balance out the wizard class, and there are options for drawbacks to allow some counters to make room for some otherwise unbalancing abilities.  <br>
<br>
Got a lot more ideas stirring, but not all familiar related so might need to save them for another post.<br>

<br>
we will almost without a doubt never see this come true<br>
but the idea is better than most ive seen<br>
<br>
<br>
You should be able to choose between them like mage pets, but they shouldnt be meatshealds. they should act as buffs, grant a type of clarity and or regen.<br>
they should should have a decent amount of hitpoints, since some things have AEs, but they shouldnt melee. it be cool if they would cast a debuff like stated above, but that would be to hard to encode, and wouldnt be practical.<br>
<br>
They should ad resistances and stats like a personal bardsong, but without the graphics.<br>
<br>
maybe a mana or HP buff too.<br>
<br>
they should be little animals, like maybe a willowisp,little puma, bat, skeleton, imp, rat,  or golem. or best of all a drake.<br>
<br>
very good idea, someone should propose this on one of the verant boards<br>

This is a great idea.  Even if I just had a rat following me around that served no other purpose I would buy the spell.  Of course I would prefer some effect, but if it were minimal I can't see how it would be unbalancing.<br>

Plus HP buff would be great since robe wearing classes have crappy AC.<br>
<br>
True, I don't want a pet I have to control.  I'd rather have the familiar that is always just sorta there for me when I need it and since I'm the caster, I wouldn't like it to cast anything.<br>

I partially agree with the previous post about being totally opposed to pets of any kind.  However, the thought of a familiar with mana regen, or HP buff, AC buff, INT buff, is very inviting.  My main point is this...  and most other casters will disagree...    If you read fantasy style stories, the TRUE nature of a wizard actually encompasses ALL of the abilities of the other casters.  Wizards are masters of ALL mind and matter.  Therefore, a true wizard would be able to wake the dead(necromancers), change form and control minds(Enchanters), summon items or create monsters(magicians).<br>
<br>
So, since this ideology would never be used within Everquest, let me concentrate on the familiar and say that it would at LEAST scratch the surface of improving our overall usefulness.  I am not sure if it would make a huge dent... but boy would it look GREAT!!!!!<br>

It's an interesting idea.  However, how would it behave?  Rather than making Verant come up with some behavior perhaps we as a community can figure out the best way for our familiar to act.<br>
<br>
Do we want several different types of familiars?  Maybe one that sings a *personal* clarity song, one that increases resistances, and one that acts as a focus item.  By distributing some of the tasks wizards really want among several familiars, they force us to choose the right one for the right situation and still make compromises.<br>
<br>
What about dungeon crawling?  Personally, I would like the ability to park my familiar if its pathing was becoming a problem.  Given that, though, there are tons of places where you would not want to pull one because of the pathing.  Other pet casting classes are limited in this respect as well, so I would not feel cheated.<br>
<br>
Does the familiar have any offensive capability?  It would probably be best if it didn't, but there's one idea I like:  having a low hitpoint familiar that only attacked when the wizard got hit by melee.  The point is to keep wizards conscious about how much aggro they cause and to not make the familiar so powerful it wouldn't just be smacked in a round or two by some mob.<br>
<br>
What kind of downside would a familiar have?  There's the old &quot;wizard takes damage if someone kills it&quot; idea.  But killing something that doesn't have offensive capability?  That would just be a matter of staying out of AE range.  Maybe the familiar is a buff icon you can switch off, but also reduces the total number of buffs you can get because you've put one on yourself.<br>
<br>
Given all of that, I think Verant's reply would be along the lines of &quot;a bard does all of that, just group with them&quot; and &quot;we don't want to reduce the amount of class interdependence&quot;.<br>
<br>
The only thing that a familiar might do that a bard couldn't would be to act as a focus item that either reduced mana cost or increased the caster's ability (damage, resistance check, etc.).  They've already done this with the specializations.  Our DDs already cost less to cast because of that.<br>
<br>
A familiar is a wonderful idea but I don't think Verant will go for it.  (I'm playing devil's advocate here...give me a familiar and I'll be the happiest little wizard you ever did see.)<br>

<br>
The prospects of having different focus familiars each adding to the effectivenes of a given spell line or granting the wizard enhanced abilities are unlimited.<br>
<br>
Miniature lava drake = Focus familiar<br>
Grants the wizard a 10% damage bonus and/or 10% mana reduction. Maybe even to the entire party.<br>
<br>
Faerie = Mana familiar<br>
Grants the wizard and/or party a 10-20% bonus to mana regeneration.<br>
<br>
Miniature lava imp = Resistance familiar<br>
Grants a 20-40 bonus to all resistances. Wizard and/or group.<br>
<br>
Erolis Bloodthorn = Familiar of life<br>
Grants a 20% bonus to health regeneration. Wizard and/or group.<br>
<br>
Most importantly the benefit of calling forth a familiar should be equally dangerous if you accidently loose your precious friend to a frenzied mob.<br>
<br>
Let the familiars have from 100 to 1000 HPs dependant on the lvl of the wizard, and make the wizard take a system shock damage equal to the total damage done to the pet.  I'm sure, even at lvl 60, you wouldn't want to loose you familiar and recieve a system shock hit for 1000 pts of damage.<br>
<br>
Keep the ideas comming.  Once Verant opens up for the wizard class discussion we should present him with a full list of current fixes and a wishlist for additions including this familiar thread =)<br>

Other then the look of some creature that is. <p>I contain the powers of the Ancient Dragons, and from my lord Gaav, the Deomon Dragon King!!! Do not underestimate me....

Ok lets step back a sec.. while I love the idea.. look at it from outsiders point of veiw.<br>
<br>
1.  Wizards are masters of Evocation<br>
2.  Magicians are masters of summoning<br>
<br>
<br>
Now you have stated we would summon or conjure this familar to be with us.. which class does that fall under eh?<br>

Adding mana/hp regen is highly unlikely given that would unbalance our powers considerably (We have manaskin at 52 already, doesn't do much but every little bit helps).  Having a familiar should be more focused on adding extra &quot;flavor&quot; to our characters.  For example, a wizzie could have only one particular type of familiar and this would involve a quest for each type (much like choosing a spell specialization).  That way we don't fall into the other classes ability to call up different pets to suit the situation, and it fits more into the wizzy roleplaying style of having one permanent familiar.  Making the familiar give only small stat/buff/resist enhancement also gets away from everyone choosing the same pet (everyone would be running around with the mana/hp regen one if that was an option) and giving us the ability to give the pet a name would also further seperate us from mages/necros (do you really want a familiar named jabortik/Gobnerb/etc?)  There are already several mob models suitable for familiars (bixie, pixie, wisp) so this wouldn't be too hard to implement. It would also be fun to allow some limited social control over the pets too.<br>

However, when we/Graffe approach Verant with this I think we should have our ducks in a row.  Yes, magicians are going to raise holy hell.  The only way I personally think we could minimize this is to all agree that it is a nocombatant, and has some repercussions to dying.  I also like the idea of getting a random familiar out of some short list, with different effects on all of them.  We could also have this implemented as a quest- Tunare knows we wizzies need some more- however, preferably a quest that doesn't involve us killing a MOB that spawns 13 times a RL year.  As far as the graphic list goes- we could have Verant implement this with one standard graphic- w/possibly a variable color denoting which familiar it is.  Just a thought, but I can't see that Verant can give us an unqualified 'NO' if we approach this in a thoughtfull manner.<br>

I have shelf upon shelf of fantasy novels and myth and lore from history. Wizards have Familiars... <br>
<br>
I play Dungeons and Dragons (all 3 editions) and that's something that is generally agreed on, wizards are the casters that run the gauntlet of abilities...they can cast from every school of magic, they're just not SUPER good at any one. Kinda like Druids are in EQ...they can do everything...just not any one thing extreemly well. Every other caster can nuke to a certain extent...what can we summon? an eye of zomm? what can we charm...nothing that I know of....what can we change ourselves into...nothing that I know of...we only have 2 buffs I can think of that we can give someone else (besides levitate and invis)...I don't see where letting us have a familiar will unbalance us with the other classes. none of the things a familiar can give us is as good as what the other classes can contribute and since we've been self only buffs for so long I think the benifits from a familiar should stay for us only. I don't think they should affect the whole group. I also rather like the idea that if your familiar dies you take damage...but something else that they've implimented in 3rd edition D&amp;D tha I like is that you lose exp if your familiar dies. Would make Wizards very consious of where their familiar is and what's happening to them. The only other point I have is that the familiar should not be KOS or get agroed unless it attacks first or the wizard is under agro.<br>

Pets would be too powerful, so a non-combatant familiar would be perfect.  I think that they should be summon spells (mages can nuke, why can't we summon??)  and they should get more powerful and have better buffs as you go up in level.  If the familiar dies, you should take an amount of damage equal to the familiars HP, and get stunned for x amount of time (to deal with the severed link between you and it)  It should be like a buff, and stay with you when zoning.  You should also be able to store it (like in a backpack, BG2 anyone?)  so that if you don't want to watch it, you don't have to.  Just make it so that if it's stowed away, the buffs it gives you are not active.  Also, don't make it give ultra buffs, just little things like +2 int, or mana regen of half a breeze.  Definitely no group stuff, we are all about personal buffs (flicker flames are a VI joke).<br>

I have enjoyed playing a wizard immensely. My only issue is that at some times I feel very dependent on Ench/Bard for the mana regen.   I think that I am pretty good at Mana management, but in some fast paced battles I cant keep up. A lil pet that would be strictly an enhancement would be great. A mana regen, perhaps a dmg shield or a HP buff.  Maybe make it so the preferred ones, i.e. mana regen, cost more mana and have more of an adverse effect when they die. <br>

<br>
I like the idea of a minor AC/HP/MANA buff. But lets look more into the RolePlaying aspect of this. Instead of the same Familiar for all. How about 1 familiar per Diety. You worship Cazic you get a Golem or something. Agnostic's I think would be screwed. (darn I'm agnostic) Or 1 per Race/Diety would even be better. Help define the background of who you really are in EQ. <br>
