<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    The point to all of this I think is that Wizards have no DEFINING ability that is useful in group situations.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Ok, it seems to me that here, you think that a wizards defining ability is the ability to nuke(though you do not say so).  You seem to also think that Armok has shown this ability to be useless in group situations(which he hasn't).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    Armok has summed up everything extremely well and I would hope when (if) something gets done that wizards are the ONLY ones to get it. Selfish I know but we MUST have something that defined us apart from spells that are used in 0.5% of the game (e.g. Dragonsbane/Giantsbane spells)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Ok, here you seem to think that the only truely defining spells are giantsbane and dragonsbane spells, which is far from the truth when it comes to raiding.  Perhaps only 0.5% of the game raids that level mobs, but a far greater percentage raids other kunark/velious/planar/luclin mobs.  On those raids, quite often wizard nuking ability is almost <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    critical</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Despite your exaggeration, we can still omit the raiding game if you'd like and focus on grouping.  And what it seems you want is a unique and unseful ability to bring to groups that no other class has.  You also seemed to have assumed that every other class in the game already has unique and useful &quot;defining abilities.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    Mages have pets, Necro's have pets and dots, Wizards have TL's -&gt; whooppe dee doo.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Here, you point to Mages and Necros and definine them in terms of their pets and necro dots, comparing them to translocates.  This shows fairly well that you really do not have much clue about what Magicians and Necros actually do.  If you say a necro's defining group abilities are pets and dots, then I would feel quite comfortable saying that a wizard's defining abilities for a group are fast damage and evac.. which kind of destroys your whole argument.  <br>
<br>
You see, both Magicians and Necromancers and in fact every class in the game bring a whole package of abilities to a group.  Mages have the most potent pets, they can nuke, they can cast damage shields, and they can debuff mobs.  Wizards are no different in this regard.  Wizards have the most potent nukes, they can snare, they can stun, they can port, and they can root.  The <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    only</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> issue here, is that wizards most important ability, their nukes, aren't up to par with what they should be.  You really can't draw the conclusion that other classes with nukes as part of their package, don't also suffer from the same problems on a smaller scale.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    We are a great class and I'm a FIRM beilever that we should be what we were originally intended to be -&gt;&gt; MASTERS OF DAMAGE.<br>
<br>
With the changes Armok has listed we would become this class. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->So you think that adjusting mana costs and twink items in order to place wizards slightly over warriors in terms of average group long term damage dealing ability that you will suddenly become the MASTERS OF DAMAGE?  I really hope you aren't disappointed if actual changes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    do</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> happen, and turn out to be far less than you expected.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    Sorry but wizards are definately not &quot;tons of damage to boss mobx ability&quot;. Armoks charts show this as we cannot sustain dmg over time and quickly become outpaced by other classes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Armok's charts show that in specific conditions wizards are outpaced by other classes.  Namely, in melee based groups(the most common dungeon xp group) with a specific proportion of time spend in combat wizards are outpaced by other classes, except in the low 50's range, where the data shows them to be fairly well tuned(maybe slightly on the low side).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    Yes we can do big dmg to DB and GB mobs but this is very specic damage to specific mobs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->As I said before, DB and GB mobs were not, in fact, the only mobs I was talking about.  All the way back to boss fights like the Ghoul Arch Magi in lower guk or Lord Nagafen, a wizards ability to deal a lot of damage during a boss mob fight was one of the biggest highlights of the class.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    SoL Boss mobs have HUGE hitpoints 500k plus and fights sometimes last half an hour..Within 5 mins I'm oom and using my Velk robe to Nuke and down to 40 dps.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Perhaps these mobs are a specific issue that should be addressed.  Anyway, I also wonder how well you are managing your mana pool and med time, and whether you realize that with proper mana regen, you'll be able to do a lot more than just use your velk robe in the last 25 minutes of a half hour fight.  If you can get your standing regen to 25 points per tick(clarity2(11) and bard song(14)), then over 30 minutes you'll have 7500 mana, not counting the 2700-3000 stored mana that you burn in the first 5 minutes.  If you can manage to meditate, you'll have a lot more mana than that.  There still might be a problem with damage output on these big unbanable mobs, but please don't try to exaggerate things by claiming that you can be oom and useless but for a robe for 25 whole minutes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    All classes have abilities that define them..Although it is more perception of a class rather than a definition.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->In my opinion, any perceptions other than the truth are bad and should be countered if at all possible.  Showing real data such as Armok has done does not attempt to change perceptions to anything other than the truth.  The perceptions you have listed are innaccurate, and I would hope that anyone that agrees with these perceptions takes a little time learn a bit more about the class and understand more fully how such a class fits into the game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Mages have pets</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Mages also have nukes(and rains and PB AE's), damage shields, resist debuffs, summoned goodies, and Call of the Hero.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Necro's have pets and strong dots</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
They too, have nukes.  They also can fear, ghetto-mez, dominate the undead in various ways, feign death, emergency rez, DMF, snare, root, transfer hp, lifetap, summon corpses, and dump mana.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Clerics have healing and buff skills</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Not going to argue much here, but clerics also have an excellent line of single target stuns and they do have decent knockback nukes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Druids are an all round class</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
So a druids defining ability is that they have no defining ability?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Rogues are dmg dealers</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Mostly, rogues deal damage, but they also do Corpse Recovery, recon, lock picking(no more glamorous than translocates), and pulling sometimes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Monks are dmg dealers</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Funny, I thought most people would percieve monks as pullers/damage dealers.  In any case, monks are self sufficient fighters with the ability to deal damage, feign death, mend, sneak, and take damage when necessary.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Chanties are melee buffs and CC</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Judging from the number of groups that look for &quot;manamakers(lol)&quot; I would say the perception of enchanters is that they are the caster buffers.  But in reality, enchanters have almost as wide a selection of abilities as a necromancer.  Among their useful combat abilities are Mez, root, tash, ST stun, PBAE stun, DoTs, ST nukes, haste, clarity, slow, charm, mem blur, mana drain/suck, rune, and the animation pet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Wizards are nukers</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
So are mages and druids.  Wizards just do it a lot better.  Wizards also, as mentioned above, snare, root, stun, and port.  I'm not saying that the sum of those abilities comes up to a balanced class, but what I am saying is that a perception of wizards as purely nukers is a Bad Thing and certianly not something <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    I</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, if I were a game designer, would want to encourage.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>    Wizards are &quot;perceived&quot; to be damage dealers but in reality we do not meet this perception by a very long stretch.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->All this means is that players could be very stupid and have mistaken perceptions.  Armok said it more accurately, that players maturing in a twink environment see the poor performance of a wizard and it sticks, even if it's not quite true at the higher levels.<br>
<br>
Armok wrote:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    Since there is a severe lack of wizard equipment which will adjust wizard damage output in any meaningful way, especially at the lower levels, this creates an environment where players level up seeing wizards poor performance and so acquire a bias against them. </i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
IMO that is really as far into perceptions as is really important to go into.  Many people percieve Black people to be rude, crude, stupid, and violent, but those perceptions are totally bogus.  The only good thing you could do with perceptions like that is to stamp them out and force a person to treat each case seperately and fairly.  The same goes with classes in Everquest.  Get rid of these stupid and limiting perceptions and at least try to understand how the game <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> works, or don't bother complaining. <p><hr align="left"  width="100%">

<br>
non DB / GB-able mobs...can be hit with regular nukes 99 % of the time, which can be nearly as efficient -&gt; More efficient than DB / GB.<br>
<br>
DB/GB are a BAD, BAD idea. Why do you think resists on Luclin uber mobs aren't that bad?<br>
<br>
That's right, because the nukes you are supposed to use on them are the new high damage luclin nukes.<br>
<br>
Wizard's problem is that our damage output in most day to day exp grinds is not up to par with other classes as it should be. This is our single biggest problem, above anything else.<br>
<br>
+ Raids: We do fine, great in fact. The only people that I see outdamaging me are generally rogues with 5 or 6 levels on me.<br>
<br>
+ Soloing: Again, we do quite well here.<br>
<br>
+ Exp grouping: We fall short of what we should do here. It's obvious to every wizard that plays, it's obvious on paper. It's NOT as bad as some people think, and you might even make an arguement that since we do fine on raids and soloing, we don't need grouping power, but then again, why do enchanters and monks do so well in exp groups?  <p><table border="0" width="111">

&quot;Perhaps these mobs are a specific issue that should be addressed. Anyway, I also wonder how well you are managing your mana pool and med time, and whether you realize that with proper mana regen, you'll be able to do a lot more than just use your velk robe in the last 25 minutes of a half hour fight. If you can get your standing regen to 25 points per tick(clarity2(11) and bard song(14)), then over 30 minutes you'll have 7500 mana, not counting the 2700-3000 stored mana that you burn in the first 5 minutes. If you can manage to meditate, you'll have a lot more mana than that. There still might be a problem with damage output on these big unbanable mobs, but please don't try to exaggerate things by claiming that you can be oom and useless but for a robe for 25 whole minutes.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, Did it again tonight and the following happened (had c3 and bard song):<br>
<br>
1. Emptied my mana onto the mob within 5 mins.  This was alternating SS and robe to try to minimise agro.<br>
2. Casted robe for another 20 mins whilst regening mana standing up<br>
3. Had a full bar of mana to burn away again in the last few minutes of the fight.  In which time I chained SS and concussion one after the other.<br>
<br>
Please think about what that means.  For 20 minutes of the fight I was down to casting the velk robe at 40 dps where a melee is chugging away for the full fight at whatever a decent equipped melee fights for (100dps?)<br>
<br>
That is still appalling and is not exaggerating at all.<br>
<br>
Now I'd be interested to see the dmg logs of any other class.  Assuming no one died all melee classes will out damage a wizard by at least 100%.  <br>
<br>
There is no &quot;there still might be a problem&quot; - there is a definate problem.  I just wish I had the data to back it up but its pretty obvious imo just thinking about it logically.<br>
<br>
oh btw, just in case you didn't know the velk robe is a 15/16 sec cast so you can't med during its casting (although you used to be able to due to a bug). Also sit agro is a factor, so using a velk robe for a wizard IS the most efficient use of mana over time (or VP robe).<br>

This is an excellent summation of what so many of us have felt/perceived to be the problem in xp groups backed up by hard data. Kudos Armok on a well thought out, researched and presented post.<br>
<br>
<br>
***********WARNING LONG POST BELOW***********<br>
<br>
And I do mean long, apologies in advance but I started this and it sort of just flowed and grew into the beast below.<br>
<br>
While reading through this post I couldn’t get away from forming some of my own thoughts on this conundrum of getting into xp groups. While a lot of us have felt there is a problem, Armok has articulated it well and backed it up by data. I think how we are look at the problem could use a slightly different perspective. I feel damage is only one of the roles brought to a group situation. When forming a group or replacing members to a group a leader has to weigh several factors and come up with the best group makeup or replacement. I will attempt to describe what are the roles expected to be filled in an experience group because it is these roles that must be filled or compensated for to make a successful xp group. I will go into greater detail about each role.<br>
<br>
Tank<br>
Healer<br>
Crowd Control<br>
Haste<br>
Slow<br>
Mana Regen<br>
Snarer<br>
Buffer<br>
Utility<br>
Damage Dealer<br>
Evacer<br>
Puller<br>
<br>
I may have missed some or some could be even further broken out of some of the categories provided. <br>
<br>
Tank – To take/absorb damage from the mob and keeping its attention away from the others in the group. Provide damage output as a secondary function. <br>
<br>
Healer – To heal the main tank and any others that need it.<br>
<br>
Crowd Control – To mez or charm any “adds” thereby neutralizing their threat or augmenting their power to the group.<br>
<br>
Haster – Haste the main tank and any other melees so they provide more damage.<br>
<br>
Slower – Slow the mobs so they damage the main tank or who ever gains agro less.<br>
<br>
Mana Regen – Provide enhancement to the mana regeneration of the casters.<br>
<br>
Snarer – Slowing the movement rate of a mob so that when it goes into flee mode it does not get away bring back its friends and at some point stops and doesn’t fight back.<br>
<br>
Buffer – Providing buffs to the members of the group which enhance their stats, hp, ac allowing them to run faster and jump higher.<br>
<br>
Utility – This one isn’t as clearly accepted as some of the other categories but encompasses such things as Pick Locks, Call of the Hero, Translocates. Things that don’t fit neatly into any of the other categories and I am undoubtedly missing some.<br>
<br>
Damage Dealer – The ability to deal a great amount of damage to the mob causing it to die.<br>
<br>
Evacer – If the feces hits the rotating blade, the ability to remove the party from the situation.<br>
<br>
Puller – The ability to bring the mob to the party in the most efficient and timely manner and preferably alone.<br>
<br>
As I stated previously I may have missed some or some of you may not agree with my categorization but clearly there are more roles then slots. I felt such things as Haste and Mana Regen were sufficiently distinct buffs to merit their own category.<br>
<br>
I would like to give my analysis of what roles are essential, which are highly desired, somewhat desired and situational. It is my opinion that there are really only 2 essential roles to be filled, that of the healer and tank. You may not agree with my ratings and I welcome discussion on this to more broadly illuminate the situation. My categories of rating could probably use some tweaking but is a fair approximation.<br>
<br>
Tank- Essential – Without someone to hold the attention of the mob and be capable of sustaining the damage output of the mob without unduly taxing the healer the group will slow down and become inefficient. <br>
<br>
Healer- Essential - Without someone to heal the tank and others in an efficient and timely manner the group will slow down and become inefficient.<br>
<br>
Crowd Control – Highly desirable to Essential – The ability to mez unwanted mobs sometimes means the difference between success and failure. A well-tuned group can sometimes overcome these situations without crowd control but it is much easier with it. <br>
<br>
Haste – Highly desirable – The ability to make melee faster makes the mob dead quicker making the group more efficient.<br>
<br>
Slow – Highly desirable to Essential - The ability to slow down a mobs damage output decreases the load on the healer.<br>
<br>
Mana Regen – Highly desirable – Mana Regen makes all casters more efficient.<br>
<br>
Snarer – Highly desirable to Essential – If a mob runs it’s a bad thing, roots are a poor substitute but in some situations this is not an issue.<br>
<br>
Buffer – Highly desirable to somewhat desirable – Buffs make everyone better.<br>
<br>
Utility – Situation – There are certain areas that makes this features essential, other places they are unnecessary. Pick Locks for the crypt in Sebilis for example.<br>
<br>
Damage Dealer – Highly Desirable – The ability to have a high output of damage allows more kills in the same amount of time. This is generally thought of in dps - damage per second.<br>
<br>
Evacer – Somewhat desired to Situational – Evacing is inefficient at best and could cause the loss of the camp at worst. While its better than dieing in some situations, often times there are alternatives. With each expansion the camps have essentially gotten further away from the evac points making return to the camp a time consuming process which could easily result in the loss of the camp. Some dungeons evac/port is the only means of egress – charasis for example.<br>
<br>
Puller – Highly desirable – A good puller makes the difference between a great group and fluster cluck.<br>
<br>
Thus, we have 2 essential, 3 highly desirable to essential, 4 highly desirable, 1 highly desirable to somewhat desirable, 1 somewhat desirable to situational, and 1 situational. <br>
<br>
The reason I gave some dual or straddle ratings is that not everyone will come to the same conclusion in every situation. Whether that “situation” is location specific or personnel specific, I felt some leeway was plausible. <br>
<br>
So, given this we have 6 slots and a bunch of roles to shoehorn into those 6 slots. This is the conundrum that faces every group leader when forming groups or replacing members that leave. Group leaders look for the best fit for those roles. They would take a cleric over a druid as a healer, a rogue over a wizard as a damage dealer, etc. This is the process that I feel causes us to lose out so often. I could go ahead and rate (perhaps others will) how the classes fit the particular roles but it would be entirely subjective and open to wide disagreement (you may call them flames) and wouldn’t really get to where I was trying to go. Which is to say that of the Essential or Highly desired group roles the Wizard is a second rate class at best.<br>

Lol - when my Paladin was level 17 he grouped with a level 15 Wizard. We took out a Hill Giant. Now, I am not going to say how we did it ...and yes, the Wizard was reduced to meleeing but if Verant thinks that is the limit of player ingenuity than maybe they really do have their head up their ass.<br>
<br>
And I mean c'mon. This is a group game, so rather than incouraging people to take chances as a group fighting things much tuffer than they are, they wussy out and impose limits.<br>
<br>
Than people wonder why some of us do not think Verant is a good game company. Their logic is pathetic.<br>
<br>
<br>
And if the &quot;history lesson&quot; is true... that is still a pathetic solution. That is a 'quick fix' and a lame one at that. I can think of two right possible solutions better than that one in the time it took me to write that sentence ...and I type fairly fast. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utorridbrightflame.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torrid BrightFlame</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/7/02 4:50:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=152>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~torrid/torrs2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: post 50... again</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> On those raids, quite often wizard nuking ability is almost critical.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Sorry but I'm going to have to totaly and completely disagree with you here.  My guild has done just about every uber mob there is w/ one or no wizards.  Did vulak with one wizard.  Could have done it w/o any, it would just take forever.<br>
<br>
The only mobs we even even consider asking the question of &quot;how many wizards we got?&quot; are dragons that slow melee.  And uh, it has yet to stop us from killing any of them with only 2 active wizards...<br>
<br>
Wizard damage is where it should be on bane mobs usually though, IMO.  My biggest gripe is that it takes pdots just to do the damage we SHOULD be doing. <p>Torrid BrightFlame

<br>
Your point being? You can kill pretty much any uber MOB without rogues too, but you don't see many guilds doing it. Most of the top-tier guilds have many active wizards because guilds recognize the power they bring to a raid-type setting. <br>

Yes.  Mana pumping and corpse summoning good.

Yeah, I have done exp groups without a cleric, but it wasn't all that great. I have seen raids and exp groups called off due to lack of Cleric, Enchanter, and tanks. That's it. Some raids can do without Enchanters, but for the most part, these are the 3 key classes. Tanks can often be Pali, Ranger, or War, but in the end, a War is most desired. If we move down from there, Shaman and Rogue then add in. Dragons and VS are about the only time I recall anyone looking around the globe anxiously for Wizards, that and Hate or Air for a taxi.<br>

<br>
The fact is, Verant made healing so efficient and melee so effective that this combination could theoretically kill anything in the game.  Unlike mana which is very inefficiently 'healed,' and magic damage - which is not nearly as efficient as healing -  melee damage is infinite.  There's absolutely nothing stopping the tank from doing damage for eternity except the amount of hit points that tank has.<br>
<br>
Should healing be less efficient?  I wouldn't go that way, but I DO think Verant should reconsider the way they have been with magic damage and mana. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubrittneyfoh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brittney FoH</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.britts.freewebspace.com/images/rs3_01.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/8/02 3:19:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=162>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> lol</span><hr size=1> Wow you guys crack me up. hehehe <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a> <b>8</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=648.topic&start=201&stop=204>11</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=648.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=648.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=648.topic&index=162><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=648.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=648.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=648.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=648.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
