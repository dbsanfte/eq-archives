With out bonds of force it's slightly dangerous as you will have to run out of the 4 mobs range and begin casting as soon as they get within range and hope the spell goes off before they catch up to you, it may not even be possible with the casting time, not sure what it is, but definitely worth a try. <p><hr>

Snare isn't needed - the area there is pretty clear of other mobs and PCs, and there are four Gobbie Warrior spawn points there.  The spawn took just a bit longer than my med time.  Just tried my first quad-kiting there and made 2 bubbles of xp in as many hours (and the most fun I've ever had soloing! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).  It should go a bit faster now that I have a clue what I'm doing...<br>
The tactics I was using was what I've read here...pull with Staff of Temperate Flux, use it to gauge distance, then Pillar of Lightning.  Change view to check the grouping of the four critters, round 'em up if necessary...lather rinse repeat.<br>

WOW!<br>
<br>
After I practiced on the borer beetles in North Karana for a while I was getting the hang of it. Being that I didn't know where to go try this in the old world, I returned to kunark as suggested. I went to the little Goblin tower that Tulians and DylonBrynne suggested. It was kind of scary, I tried just 2 to start off with, and had good success, then 3, then 4. <br>
<br>
I was jammin, I was having the most fun that I have ever had playing, My heart was pounding, hands shakey, it was a blast. I was getting 2 blue bubs per pull. I actually kited 5 at a time and would keep changing my target to the one that had the most health to make sure everyone got a little lightning lovin. When I started my 1st pull I had just dinged 26. I couldn't stop and ended up playing all night and at 5:30 am when the sun came up, I was half way to 29!<br>
<br>
I died twice, once was when I was AFK at the windmill while getting a drink, the other time I ran out of sow, but got a high level rez and got 2 blue bubbles back.<br>
<br>
Here are some tips from me to all the level 24 wizards out there. <br>
<br>
1)Sow lasts a little longer than 30 minuites, get a stopwatch and start it everytime you get sow. If you are getting close to 30min, don't pull unless your sure your sow will last.<br>
<br>
2)buy some SOW potions, these are good for when you cannot find a druid or shaman. You will be lucky to see a ranger high enough to cast this anywhere near the gobby tower.<br>
<br>
3)Save any jems and pages you loot, trade the jems for SOW's and the pages for breeze's. I would OOC that I had a page if anyone wanted it, a chanter would usually respond and offer to buy it, I would tell the chanter it was free if they would come to get it, and they would usually breeze me without me having to ask.<br>
<br>
4)Use the 3rd person camera. Press F9 4 times after you pull, have the camera facing you while you ball up, and then move it behind you when kiting. If you turn on mouselook (default F12) and hold the right mouse button you can swing the camera around, and zoom in and out using up and down respectivly.<br>
<br>
5)This should actually be #1, Get the staff of tempurate flux, it rocks. Use it to tell when out of range, take a few steps more steps, wait till your feet stop movin and cast your spell, I rarely took any damage when kiting, a bub at the worst.<br>
<br>
6)Keep your leatherskin up and keep a good supply of bloodstones on you.<br>
<br>
7)Have fun<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the great suggestions, this has totally made the game more fun for me. I had people asking me if I needed help, and a few stayed around to watch. <br>
<br>
Now I just need to figure out where to go next.<br>

I have to say though that its sooo fun! Makes you feel so damn powerful killing 4 blues and still have 2 bubs of mana left, thats power my friends!<br>
When telling a guildie he replied with &quot;Oooh damn man, wish I could take a white solo! Remind me to never duel you!&quot;<br>
(He was a warrior so he didnt really get that dueling and kiting is very different, but nonetheless it was fun)<br>
And after reading a lot of the posts here on the board and kited singles in lake and the karanas before, I managed to learn Quadding without a single death! I even pulled a kite off when drunk! :-P<br>
<br>
Thats my lil' story folks, thanks for learning me another way to enjoy this game and I hope that others who read this really tries quadding, since its a blast! Only downthing is you dont meet so much people doing it.<br>
