Today, something which is not seen as obseen to use, at least in American culture.  Yes, I know people who do it.  Would I do it myself?  No.  I don't care what the hell they've studied and seem, how they claim that it has no negative side effects.  You want side effects? Take a look at someone who has been smoking marijuana for some time, and does so consistently.  Though not perhaps for everyone, I have no doubt that you WILL see some side effects.<br><br>The reason I am ranting about this (Forgive my language) is because I am FUCKING PISSED OFF.  My best friend's sister takes marijuana, and he said he would never think to do such a thing.  Then he did.  Then he changed, he is still him of course but he is just, ungh.  Hard to explain.  And he only did it once, his sister does it all the time.  Fine, I can live with that, he's smart, he can figure out what to do.  But now his sister is coming back from college for the month, and is going to fucking smoke with him.  Then of course he invites my other best friend, who has never done any of this shit over to do it with him.  FUCK just what I fucking need, my life is already fucked up enough, now my best friends will be messed up.  The thing I am afraid of is that they will keep on doing this.  I don't care again what studies or some shit have been conducted that prove that the side effects are negligable.<br><br>And I don't know what to fucking do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulysandor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lysandor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.dmki.tv/omani.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/1/02 10:02:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=792.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.dmki.tv/derek3_small1.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Marijuana.</span><hr size=1> Wow - take a pill.<br><br>Thats what americans always do when they feel like you do.<br><br>No side effects there, right?<br><br>/em whistles innocently<br><br>***********<br><br>Jebus - for the record.

Why do I think that?  Not necessarily that I think that the drug itself will have detremental effects on my friend, but its the other things that accompany it.  My friend has had a few problems since he was young.  He goes to a psychiatrist to help him deal with these things.  The fact is, that if he begins to take this drug on a common basis, he will begin to associate with other people who do as well, and where I come from, these people are the people, for the most part, that you DO NOT want to associate with.  Why?  Because they will (as they have done to the majority of others that are around them) make him less willing to do anything of importance.  He wants to go to a good college, and study computer science, follow in the footsteps of his father.  Will this happen if he fails every class due to neglegence to do his work (since rather then working he was smoking and &quot;hanging out&quot; with these people?)?  No.<br><br>I just don't want to see something bad happen to him.

Let me say it again, if I want to &quot;snitch&quot; on you for smoking weed &lt;you in the hypothetical sense&gt; I have every right to.  It's that simple, if you want slit my throat over that, or conjure up your ancestors to slay me because I feel that way?  Bring it.  I'll report whatever the hell I want to, I was given that right.  Think I blindly follow the law, by one post? Please.  You see, the fact of the matter is, you don't know jack shit about me, what I believe in, or how I feel about this law.  I was simply stating, that if he wants to fucking report someone for smoking weed, get off his back about it.  <br><br>   I'm sorry if I've offended you, because I know you fight &quot;my little war&quot; whatever the hell you assume about me, how I'm worthless, whatever kiddie.  The fact still remains, if you bitch to someone for doing something that they feel is right, Do us a favor and slit your own damn throat.  It's people like YOU that I hate.  Just because one person feels a certain way about something &lt;lemme do an i.e here so you can figure out what I'm saying&gt; i.e reporting someone for smoking weed, and saying they have the right to, because it's a law.  You damn them, and say they blindly follow shit and have juvenile opinions, grow up.  You want to make blatant statements like that about me, you better get to know me a lot better. <br><br>   One last time for everyone, if somebody, WANTS TO &quot;snitch&quot; about something, that is against the law, or not against the law, or whatever the hell they want to snitch about, get off their god damned backs and let them do what they feel is right.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulysandor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lysandor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.dmki.tv/omani.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/2/02 4:07:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=792.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.dmki.tv/derek3_small1.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Marijuana.</span><hr size=1> I never said anything about sliting your throat.
