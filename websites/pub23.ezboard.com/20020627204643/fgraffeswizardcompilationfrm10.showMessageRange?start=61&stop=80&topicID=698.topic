Pathing is a implementation bug.<br>

And if pathing were fixed, would mages really have much to complain about since pets ARE very useful.  Post 50 mage pets(as well as necro pets) could use an upgrade.<br>
<br>
<br>
For wizards, we don't have a huge amount that's broken by implementation.  Al'Kabor spells costing too much mana is a design problem.  Damage output between 50 and 60 needs to scale a bit more smoothly.  Pre-49 our spells SHOULD be improved a bit.<br>

<br>
You see, the situations we use to try to support the two different sides are always highly contrived.  &quot;Given X mob when you're in Y state then etc etc&quot;  So lets try to define some situations and do some evaluations.  Before we list some situations, however, lets set some judging criteria.<br>
<br>
First, I'll consider &quot;personal defense&quot; to be the innate HP and AC that every class has.  I would say that magicians and wizards are basically equal in this regard, and I don't expect much disagreement here.  In both cases, &quot;personal defense&quot; is rather low, and so each class has additional abilities they must use to protect themselves.<br>
<br>
What is the purpose of a defensive ability?  At the most basic level, the goal is to reduce or in some way mitigate the damage done to yourself so that you will survive.  However, one would never get very far in this game all they could do was protect themselves, no matter how good at it they might be.  Therefore, some weight must be given to the degree to which a defensive ability allows for the pursuit of other goals, most notably offense.  For each defensive ability we should look at a few things:<br>
<br>
How much damage does the ability prevent(or recover)?<br>
How long can damage be prevented at this rate?<br>
How much does the ability cost?  (Cost in terms of Time, Mana, and Money)<br>
What are the chances that the ability can fail?<br>
What are the costs of failure?<br>
What are the additional drawbacks, if any, that the ability has?<br>
How well does this ability facilitate the dealing of damage or other goals?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CODE START--><pre>  
I.  Solo vs one mob
   A.  You are the puller and fully prepared for battle
   B.  You are surprised
       2.  Prepared

   B.  You are surprised


III.  Group vs. Mob
   A. Surprised
   B. Prepared
</pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br>
<br>
Since I don't want to spend my whole life here, I'll just do situation <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  I.A</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> today.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  I. Solo vs. one mob</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
In an ideal situation, you are the puller and are fully prepared for battle.  Shields are up, phaser batteries are fully charged, proton torpedoes are armed and ready.  Pet is summoned and fully buffed, wizard is buffed with skin spell and has some distance between himself and the mob.<br>
<br>
The strategy here is usually something like this:  The wizard pulls the mob and snares, at which point he can nuke as much as he wants.  If required by the available space, he can root the mob.  The wiz generally just nukes as hard as possible until the mob dies.  Ideally, the wizard will take zero damage.  A Magician will either pull the mob on to his pet.  The pet holds off the mob, taking damage and dealing damage while the magician nukes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  How much damage does the ability prevent(or recover)?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
In an ideal one on one situation, snare and root will effectively eliminate all damage.  The ability to keep a mob from even swinging at you often means that 100% of the damage is prevented.  This does <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>not</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> apply to mobs that can cast damage spells or mobs with a ranged attack.<br>
<br>
For the mage, damage is not really prevented at all.  The damage is diverted, however, and this is valuable.  Pets do regain hitpoints faster, and the magician can also heal the pet.  In an ideal situation, 100% of the damage will be done to the pet and not the mage.  This <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>does</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> apply to spellcasters.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  How long can damage be prevented at this rate?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
A wizard can keep a mob off him with snare for (three?) minutes at a time, and can refresh until he runs out of mana, or out of room to move.  Critical factors:  Mob resistance, mob ranged attack, and physical space.<br>
<br>
A magician can divert damage for as long as his pet is alive and has aggro.  Critical factors:  Pet hitpoints, Mob damage dealing ability, pet taunting ability, pet mitigation ability(like stun).<br>
<br>
Here is where some tests would be good.  Measure how long it takes an average xp mob to kill a pet.  Compare that to the duration of snare.  For lengthy battles, measure the amount of mana spent on reapplying snare versus healing the pet or chain summoning new pets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  How much does the ability cost?  (Cost in terms of Time, Mana, and Money)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
A wizard must expend mana for snare at least once per battle, and must refresh it over certian intervals of time.  A mobs resistance rate can cause mana expenditure to go up.  Additionally, if the wizard needs to or chooses to use root his mana expentiture will also go up.  Casting snare takes a fairly significant amount of combat time.<br>
<br>
A magician need not spend mana on his pet every battle, however, his pet must be fully prepared before hand.  Additionally, depending on the damage dealing capabilities of the mob a magician may have to heal his pet.  A magician healing his pet spends time and mana doing so.  A magician's ability to heal is own pet is also fairly limited.  In some situations it will be impossible to outheal a mobs damage output.  Additionally, a magician pet costs the magician the ability to remain invisible, and it costs the &quot;space&quot; and danger of having a second character.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  What are the chances that the ability can fail?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
For the initial snare, there is a decent chance that it will fail totally.  For subsequent snares, the chances are lowered as a wizard can spend more mana and time reapplying snare.  Once a snare lands, however, it is extremely reliable.  Roots are no more reliable than snare, and additionally have chances to fail while in progress.<br>
<br>
A mage pet is very reliable so long as it can maintain aggro and stay alive.  If the mob has high damage output, or if the pet cannot maintain aggro, then the defensive ability of the pet will fail.  Initially, the advantage is a pet.  Once the snare lands, however, a snare is a more <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>reliable</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> means of defense for the duration of the spell.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  What are the costs of failure?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
If either of the two main abilities(pet or snare) fail, both wizards and magicians have the following options:  Stand and nuke, run away, gate.  A wizard with a skin spell up is clearly superior for both toe to toe nuking and gating away.  Otherwise the two are about even, the wizard perhaps having a slight offensive advantage in faster damage nukes.<br>
<br>
The wizard, in particular, can also attempt to reapply snare, either by channeling roots/stuns or by praying that you resist your own snare.  The idea is that if the mob is worth killing, root is a safer and more reliable way to defend yourself than trusting your hitpoints and ability to channel nukes.<br>
<br>
If the mage pet has died, he has <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>no</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> innate options other than those already mentioned.  If the mage has a root earring or a bioluminescent orb he may be able to get the battle back under control by channeling one of those item effects (root or blind, respectively).  Both of those items are also usable by a wizard.<br>
<br>
If the mage pet has simply lost aggro, a magician may be able to survive long enough for the pet to regain aggro.  All the mage really needs to do here is know when and where to move away from the mob.<br>
<br>
In both cases, the caster with failed pet/snare can expect to be vulnerable and unprepared for more combat.  However, it's worth noting that a magicians ability to use phantom armor increases the speed at which is own personal defense is full strength.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  What are the additional drawbacks, if any, that the ability has?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Snare is an AoE effect, and you risk attracting unwanted attention from other mobs in addition to snaring yourself.<br>
<br>
Pets are lower level than the owner, and typically increase the range that you can expect social mobs to come to the assistance of your target.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  How well does this ability facilitate the dealing of damage or other goals?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
The main drawback of snare in a solo situation is the time it takes to cast it.  Once snare is cast, the only limit to the amount of damage you can do is the amount of time it takes for the mob to reach you, at which point you must run a bit before casting again.  Other than this, you are free to nuke as hard as possible.  Repeated casts of snare reduces your long term ability to deal damage as well.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes, however, the ability to move without being hit is an advantage.  Certianly pullers and crowd controllers sometimes appreciate a snared mob.<br>
<br>
The main drawback of the pet is aggro.  A mage cannot overnuke his pet, or the pet will no long be able to protect him.  However, within the bounds of aggro limitations a magician is free to nuke as he pleases, so long as his pet stays alive.  He doesn't generally have to move much.  If his pet needs heals, a magician must dedicate a significant amount of time and mana healing.  A magician dedicated to healing his pet is incapable of nuking, and one or two heals in a battle drastically reduces a magicians damage output.  However, the upside to all of this is that the pet is dealing melee damage.  A magician can, in some cases, win a battle without ever casting a nuke.<br>
<br>
The magician cannot move while maintaining his pets defensive worth.<br>
<br>
<br>
As you can see, this topic is just barely begun(yet there are several pages worth), and already it's becoming really hard to tell who has the advantage.  Against mobs with a high melee output, mages will have a tougher time.  Against caster mobs, wizards will.  Against mobs that move quickly or have high resistances, wizards will.  When the shit hits the fan and the primary abilities fail, the wizard has a couple of tools to fall back on that the mage doesn't.  Mages defensive ability doubles as an offensive ability, while the wizard's defensive ability potentially allows for a much greater personal damage output.<br>
<br>
Basically, I really think we should stop focusing on who sucks more at defending themselves.  I think we're in way over out heads and I doubt that anyone is going to come up with a truely satisfying answer.<br>

Ummm... no its not.  Pets = greater defense.  Your voluminious efforts (do you get paid by the word?) to obfuscate that (But my pet isnt really THAT great...) just dont fly. <br>

<br>
Now THAT was rich... you have spilled thousands of words focusing on that very thing... so muddy the waters and now we all quit?  Ummmm.... no. Come, let us reason together... and tyry not to get mad, I'm not.<br>
<br>
Pets are defensive critters and offensive critters. They are  a pseaduo DoT, Root, damadge shield, agro pull (off of you) guard, blah blah blah... ALL AT THE SAME TIME.<br>
<br>
...neat.<br>
<br>
That being said, whats the bottom line?  Simple.  You can send your pet to take the deathblow in one direction while you run in the other, and he'll even get in a few shots of his own.  Nice. Game over.  Thank you (drive through).  Mages do in fact have greater defensive capabilities than wizards.  Thats it.  thats done.  SEEYA! I could care less if I &quot;satisy&quot; you with that answer dear Mage -- it is satisfing to me and probably to no small number of other wizards...  Pets rule for defense, but thats OK... I'm (heh heh... some say me personally) an offense based character.<br>
<br>
However, I am more than happy to go to a Mage board of your choice and troll there on this subject.  I am sure that on that board you will get the answer you want -- self interest on everyones part.  <br>
<br>
Before you go &quot;AHA!!!!&quot;... I have one char with a pet and one char without... I can honestly say that I feel safer with my pet than without.  Wonder how many of those mages would say the same without a wiz watching or listening to them? Wonder if you would? Wonder how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsieroll?  C'mon... havent you wondered?  DO YOU THINK THAT OWL WAS TELLING THE TRUTH??!??  (Three... sheesh...)<br>

Most of the time mages dont go round with pets up, it isnt wortht he hassle when moving from place to place (over a zone or several)<br>
<br>
When I cross DL only defence I have is: Sow invis lev and Scars of SIgil.<br>
Wiz pal with me on such a run, 2 mobs aggroed us, snare root, on we go. Can a mage do that? No. Dotn even suggest we can, pets take 10 secs to cast lets eee YOU get such a high lvl slow cast spell off when being beaten on, hm?<br>
<br>
Going invis kills pet..kapische, panjemajo?<br>
<br>
Now in Lower Guk for example the mage, *provided pathing doesnt  screw him up* has a better time of it than the wiz because he does have a shield in front of him.<br>
<br>
Another point: where as its true pet buys you time to run..what happens when you meet ANOTHER mob while you run, eh?<br>

I'm not out to get at wizzies, I've said for a long time the class needed major boosts in nuking power <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Oh, and serious question here: are all wizzie snares an AOE? heard that someplace thought there were single target snares? Or could person have meant there wasnt a single target snare that's good compared to an AOE one, during a span of levels?<br>

So you could have used a pet if you wanted to, and then you could have left it to handle those mobs while you ran away.<br>
Its not that hard to get enuff head start to summon a new pet. But me personaly I try and avoid aggroing alot of things.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I can tell you a story where a pet worked and root or snare wouldnt have helped. I was out walking with my pet and got aggroed by a red mob that runs faster then me. Root and snare wouldnt have had even a chance to stick, but the pet lasted long enuff for me to get away.<br>
<br>
Both wizards snares are AOE. The first one at level 29 costs 75 mana. Compare that to the same level mage pet for 200 mana and you may realise its no more free to toss snares around then to have pet around. The main advantage of pet compared to snare and root is that its not resisted. The pet will save your life at least once. Root and snare does have advantages too, but its not simple to compare. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usilverbladetheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silverblade the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/02 8:03:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=698.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/artofadreamer/3d/excaliburthumb1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: LOL... volume doth not = wisdom.</span><hr size=1> Invis lowers your aggro range <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and Yetis/cockatrices don't see invis.

<br>
Oh thats definately true about pets especially at low lvl, when wizards would have serious problems rooting/snaring due to so many high cons. But you dont make a pet every zone, for example I have Run speed3, now that is a bigger safety net usually than the pet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But only the Epic and Decoy are fast enough to keep up with me, unless I want to summon a pet and cast Velocity on it to. Decoy and Epic have looooong recast times and use significant mana.<br>

All of those are better at getting through the dreadlands than ANY of our own abilities, and they are all equally avialable to both wizards and mages.  Seriously, if you really want to run through DL don't summon a pet, don't worry about root or gate.  Go invis, levitate and increase your run speed somehow.  Stay watchful and don't go near any Giants or Drolvargs.<br>

<br>
and just a few of my observations (FYI the mage i used was 56 and the wizzy was 55)<br>
<br>
Mages IMHO are the better class for killing normal (non uber resist mobs) at higher levels without epic pet they lose much of their ability to solo.  Mages can still put out damage while medding something a wizard lacks.  Mages are also very powerful and with a strong pet can take a large amount of greens at one time.  On planar raids is where the mage loses a great deal of their power, most mages are restricted on pet usage and therefore require their nukes to be damage dealers which without malise and LoS nukes is hard to make good damage output.<br>
<br>
Wizards have to go through hell to get the power that they truly deserve.  you guys can crank out some massive damage and a good wizard can amaze many party members while a bad one will get them all killed.  Higher level hunting is where wizards shine because as the resists and hp's of mobs continue to rise the need for wizards in ToV and uber mob raids continues to grow.  wizards can nuke where mages cannot.  At higher levels wizards can solo much easier.<br>
<br>
IMHO it is really not fair to compare the two as they were both made with seperate intentions.<br>

<br>
That is the kind of analysis we need, and I hope I can inspire you to some similar dissections in the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician Class Balance Forum</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which has been lacking.  In general, the quality of the posters here in Graffes is higher, which is likely why you spend time here.<br>
<br>
Nothing much I can add here, except a few observations, feelings, and opinions.<br>
<br>
I do feel that in general <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gobaner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is an excellent defense.  I do not think I would want to play a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wizard</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for that very reason: I would feel naked without my pet.  I am willing to plan for and deal with those times when a pet is unavailable, but when he is, he rocks.<br>
<br>
I will admit that I have much more experience using <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gobaner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> defensively than either root or snare, having only experimented with druid and shaman alts.  While I have not yet mastered kiting, it obviously requires a lot of space.  Root-Dot with the shaman though is surprisingly effective, but again requires more space than having a pet.<br>
<br>
I have no problem with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wizards</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> seeking some upgrade to some particular nukes, after all they are supposed to be the masters of direct damage.  It is likely unfair that at 34ish our nukes are hardly distinguishable.  At the same time, I know <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> get a big dip in pet power at the level, and feel weakish compared to their progess in other levels.  Perhaps the larger nuke is some compensation, or perhaps both <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wizards</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mages</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are underpowered at that circle.  I do not know.<br>
<br>
Each class has a tendency to dismiss and undervalue their strengths and abilities, and exagerate the value of their own weaknesses and the strengths of others.  That is why your case study was worthwhile.  I think many <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> do not fully appreciate what how wonderful instant <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gobaner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is.  Far easier to complain.<br>
<br>
Burn down is important, and I am glad I can do it well enough.  Last night we had several overpulls and other moron's trains, and we had enough space so that I could aggro most of the adds onto the pet.  Healing the pet does not generate aggro, so one healer plus pet kept four adds fully occupied, and his damage shield warmed them up for the melees.  Then <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> /assist</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and burn down the main target.  Methodical, successful, and no enchanter.<br>
<br>
Obviously <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wizards</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> should be better than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> at burn down, but I feel I do well enough.<br>
<br>
Finally, in all the talk of caster balance, it remains my opinion that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wizards</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> should be balanced first, and then the other casters balanced against them, rather like melees were balanced against <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Warriors</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Because direct damage is central to casters in general and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wizards</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in particular, fixing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wizard</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> direct damage as the standard seems rational and fair.  The lack of pets just makes it easier and clearer to measure and adjust their damage output.<br>

It was called Quad Kiting with a Magician, and the comparison was of a Magician soloing successive blues until he had to stop vs a Wizard soloing 4 blues at a time then having to stop.  The overall xp gain was roughly equivalent (particuarly as the Mage could make his own focus gear).  Mages had some advantages and limitations unique to them, so did Wizards.  Overall, the classes were equal soloing, at least in that level range.  Earlier, Mages solo better, later, Wizards do.  Soloing is a non-issue as far as these two classes are concerned, in my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/02 2:20:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=698.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soloing Mages</span><hr size=1> I did a teoretical compare of mage with pet and kiting wizard on a thread on the magicians tower:<br>
<br>
First some asumptions to make it clearer and easier to argue against this note:<br>
<br>
As a magician its generaly not that efficient xp to outdamage the pet to get full xp. -&gt; So I will compare the xp gotten when using this less efficient magician tactic to quad kiting.<br>
<br>
To get full xp the magician needs to do more damag then the pet, but the DS will not be attributed to either. There will also be a margin of error in maybe not knowing exactly how much damage to do. -&gt; So the DS damage will give the margin of error needed for the mage.<br>
<br>
Both classes have support spells needed to be cast like DS and snare, but they wont be included in the calculations.<br>
<br>
The resist rate of quad kiting spells are not as low as on wizard nukes, so the resist rate for either class will be asumed to be near same.<br>
<br>
The will be some mobs for the magician to kill somewhere that doesnt hurt the pet harder then that it can heal as fast as the magician meditates when he outdamage the pet.<br>
<br>
Buffs, skills and focus items wont be factored in.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then to make some comparisons based on those asumptions:<br>
<br>
Quadkiting wizard damage/mana using best pre 50 spell: 4.9<br>
Magician damage/mana using best pre 50 spell to outdamage pet: 5.4<br>
<br>
Quadkiting wizard damage/mana using best post 50 spell: 10.5<br>
Magician damage/mana using best post 50 damagespell to outdamage pet: 9.5<br>
<br>
And the same for wizards not quad kiting, but this will get less resists:<br>
Singlekiting wizard damage/mana using best pre 50 spell: 2.8<br>
Singlekiting wizard damage/mana using best post 50 spell: 4.0<br>
<br>

I sat and killed 4 monsters before my mana and the pet's hps were low enough I had to stop, and it was about the same time as killing 4 creatures quad kiting with a Wizard - from finding the target to getting all mana back.  The mana use from the Mage was lower, but had to factor in the pet's hps.  Mages can solo places Wizards can't dare to, clear out greens better, and solo at lower level.  Wizards are more survivable by a slight margin (not as great as some Mages want to portray), move around better, and deal with adds more succesfully.  Overall it was a draw. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usilverbladetheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silverblade the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/30/02 4:58:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=698.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/artofadreamer/3d/excaliburthumb1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Soloing Mages</span><hr size=1> Best way to solo as a mage actually, is to chain cast.<br>
The big problem mages face is that pets take xp if they out damage, but over burning blows mana (higher resists maybe fizzles to? since we specialize in EITHER fire or magic nukes, not both, compared to a wiz)<br>
<br>
So what you do is pull the mob, sic pet, usually an earth pet. It maybe buffed, when pet's low in health and you are in command range, you start casting another pet, and pre-type /pet get lost . At last fraction of spell, say 1/3rd bubb, you hit enter key, old pet that's badly damaged is replaced by a new one. When mob is low health you can Reclaim Energy pet, and nuke-kill mob for full xp.<br>
<br>
very very efficient, for example its 325 mana for my 1005 hp nuke, or 400 mana for 57 earth pet.<br>
<br>
However it is *not* easy  bad connection, lag, any screw up and you have no pet and a very POd mob.<br>

<br>
I did not get root until level 34.  I was very relieved when I finally picked it up - almost as happy as I was the first time I got invis on my wizard (waiting until level *16* really hurt).<br>
<br>
I would take the defensive capability granted by root over the defensive ability granted by a pet (admittedly necro pets do not have the same strength as mage pets).  But having access to both, I would choose root over a pet, hands down, every time.  And wizards also have stuns, something I have yet to see mentioned in a defensive capability. <p>-Arbaon</p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=698.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=698.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=698.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=698.topic&start=81&stop=82>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=698.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=698.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=698.topic&index=80><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=698.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=698.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=698.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=698.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
