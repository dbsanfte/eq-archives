Once we ended up at Ishva camp, i was not grouped due too guiding late arrivals.<br>
<br>
Most we pulled were green, but for the Blues i only had to cast 1 conflag to get the Kill. This way i went through 44 in one evening and the rest of the group got the xp from the many greens, or when i was getting the next guild member. <p><center><img src="http://home.soneraplaza.nl/qn/prive/ja.wensveen/Branaman2.jpg" width="500" alt="" border="0" align="center"><br><table><tr>

And what would you have done</span><hr size=1> Well, I had thought about staying and taking all the kills just to rub it in, but figured that would be stooping to their level and they didn't tick me off enough for that. I really wanted to hear something from the monk afterwards but he refused to answer any /say or /tell messages (go figure). Actually everyone was pretty quiet after it was obvious that even with 4 of them there I could take the kill if I wanted to. My buddy on the other hand gets pretty vocal at times and rubbed it in for a few minutes in /ooc.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I'm still amazed at how some people use the anonymity of the game to act the way they do. Invoking the PnP is one thing in the case like this one, where there are 3 mobs. I don't agree with it, I always respect others camps (I know, &quot;you can't camp&quot;) and in this case my friend was willing to share but they didn't want that. They were using the &quot;If I engage it first it's mine&quot; in order to take everything. I had another situation one time where me and my cleric friend went to camp the smuggler in the secret area of Highpass Hold (I forget his name) for the rest of his quest. For those not familiar with it, it's about a 12 hour spawn and all you can do is sit there and wait, no placeholders and you don't want to kill the smugglers that are around there. Anyway, we get there and look everywhere to make sure no one else was camping. I cast see invis on everyone and we even shouted a couple times to make sure no one was camping. Six hours later (SIX LONG BORING HOURS), a drood and cleric show up and make their intentions known that they were going to try and kill the mob for the drop. We very politely told them that we'd been there for over six hours and the camp was ours. Naturally the drood invoked &quot;policy&quot; saying there's no such thing as camps and continued to /say how they were gonna own the mob etc. I was /role and he had no idea I was a wizard. About 2 hours passed with the drood making his snide remarks and me and my friend just sitting there. The mob popped and I cast as they were running to it and aggro'd the mob on me and we proceeded to burn it down in short time.<br>
<br>
It was kinda funny actually cuz the cleric did say afterwards that if they had known I was a wizard they never would have stuck around .. hehe! Obviously the drood had nothing to say <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufnagaton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fnagaton</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/6/01 7:16:26 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.wellytop.com/Fnagaton/FnagHead.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: You're gonna KS a wizard??? And what would you have done</span><hr size=1> As a Wizard I have come across this kind of thing before from single people or groups of people. As long as the average level of a group is roughly the same as your level and they do not have a wizzy or a mage then you will be certain of being able to take a kill from that group.<br>
Sometimes even now I get tanks, monks, mages etc come up to me and say that as a challenge they will be able to take an enemy from me while I was soloing. I always accept their challenge and always win. Even if a group have a good head start on the damage I will usually win such battles.<br>
Another example would be a raid situation where even if I am the only one casting in our group we can get the kill if needed.<br>
Just remember that no other class can out damage a wizard in a quick mana burn fight.<br>
If someone challenged you in the future, accept, prove your point and walk away with them wondering how they failed. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
