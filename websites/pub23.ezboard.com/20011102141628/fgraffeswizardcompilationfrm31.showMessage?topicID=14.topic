<br>
This is the quest from WW.<br>
<br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:07:17 2001] You say, 'Hail, Makil Rargon'<br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:07:17 2001] Makil Rargon says 'Greetings, Shunli . I am Makil Rargon, an esteemed assistant to the great wizard [Al'Kabor]. What can I help you with? <br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:07:23 2001] You say, 'What al'kabor?'<br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:07:23 2001] Makil Rargon says 'Al'Kabor is the most powerful wizard on all of Norrath. He is currently back to his Combine Empire research. Being his most trusted assistant, he assigned me to follow up on his fusibility [research] findings. Do you have any information to offer? <br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:07:30 2001] You say, 'What research?'<br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:07:30 2001] Makil Rargon says 'Ah. Yes, his fusibility research. Al'Kabor has been studying the melting point of minerals. Here. Take this journal. It explains what fusibility is. Over the last few years, he has conducted several tests on [fusible ores]. <br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:07:36 2001] You say, 'What fusible ores?'<br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:07:37 2001] Makil Rargon says 'An ore is considered fusible if it can be melted. Now, this book explains the most unique forms of fusible ore that the master has conducted [experiments] on. <br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:07:48 2001] You say, 'What experiments'<br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:07:48 2001] Makil Rargon says 'So far his research has been quite successful. This journal explains what he has been able to accomplish. He has managed to create several magical items including an artifactual scepter of great power. While only he can grant permission to a worthy wizard to possess the artifact, if you are willing to help me complete a [fusibility test], I can offer you another item of great strength against the elements. <br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:08:00 2001] You say, 'What Fusibility Test?'<br>
[Thu Aug 16 03:08:00 2001] Makil Rargon says 'Very well then . . . Fill this Empty Fusible Ore Crate up with four different . Bring me back the Full Crate of Fusibfusible ores then seal itle Ore and I will use the compound to create a magical item that was developed by Master Al'Kabor.<br>
<br>
the first book he gave me:<br>
&quot;The Fusibility study<br>
By Al' Kabor<br>
Part 1: What is Fusibility?<br>
<br>
By nature, most minerals have some point at which they can be melted. In order to determine what that point is, fusibility tests must be conducted. Being a master of the scientific art of wizardry, I, of course, have mastered this process. When exposing a mineral ore to a controlled amount of heat and other factors, it slowly shrinks, forming a liquid base od particles.<br>
<br>
Over the last few years, I managed to collect several samples of ore that produce a unique output when sunjected to these fusibility tests.<br>
<br>
My research continues...&quot;<br>
<br>
The second book he gave me:<br>
&quot;Part 2: The Fusible Ores<br>
<br>
<br>
Fusible Coral Ore:<br>
<br>
Back when unraveling the secrets behind the demise of the Kedge, I confronted Phinigel Autropos, the last survivor of his kind. While speaking with him and enduring his il--tempered threats and warnings toward me, I noticed coral-like ore on the reef of his domain. I managed to collect a few samples of this fascinating mineral. <br>
<br>
This ore is composed of coral reef shells, another substance, not yet defined, and is tightly compressed by the water of the Kedge Keep.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fusible Earthen Ore:<br>
<br>
When those bumbling gnomes destroyed the Hatch releasing Yael and Dartain, minerals from the Plane of the Underfoot dispersed outward onto the surrounding area.<br>
This form of earthen ore is one of the hardest substances currently existing on Norrath and is the source of the earthen golems and elementals who lurk in the Hole.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fusible Igneous Ore:<br>
<br>
I spent many months researching upon the continent of Kunark. I came across a unique form of lava in the Skyfire Mountains. These mountains have several dormant volcanoes filled with lava waiting to erupt. It was around one of these volcanoes where I found fusible igneous ore.<br>
<br>
When volcanic lava cools it forms into a hard-form mineral. This mineral is by far one of the hardest minerals on Norrath and requires extreme heat to melt.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fusible Velium Ore:<br>
<br>
Although he is usually a bothersome individual, the dwarven warrior Thubar Axebringer has assisted me with obtaining samples of velium ore. He managed to find a few rare pieces of it in the Western Wastes of Velious.<br>
<br>
Velium ore is the most unique ore I have found so far. Its composition relies heavily on the coldness of the area it is found. The cooler the area, the more tightly compressed it is likely to be. In addition, the more compressed the ore is, the greater the likelyhood of it being useful in spell research.<br>
<br>
My research continues...&quot;<br>
<br>
The third book he gave me:<br>
&quot;Part 3: The Experiments<br>
<br>
<br>
Continuing my research on the fusibility of the fusible coral, earthen, igneous, and velium ores, I have conducted several experiments. By mixing the velium ore with the other three, I discovered quite an extraordinary magical compound. When cooled, the velium caused the compound to expand and quickly harden - the outcome, a product that is uniquely resistant to the elements.<br>
<br>
In order to make use of this newly created substance, I performed the experiment again. This time, while reciting a few incantations that I have been working on. I quickly then poured the compound into a mold of a scepter while chilling it. With the power of the chilled fusible ore compound and the spell incantation, I managed to create quite an unusual scepter artifact.<br>
<br>
When held by a wizard of great power, not unlike myself, of course, the magical energy of the scepter flows throughout the mind expanding the intelligence while providing a greater protection from the elements.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I would only entrust a most loyal assistant with the safeguarding of such a powerful artifact.<br>
<br>
At this time, Makil Rargon is the only assistant whom I am sure I can trust to continue on with my fusibility research. I have authorized him to release my findings regarding this study to others since I'm positive that only Makil Rargon and I, myself, can duplicate the process.<br>
<br>
My research continues...&quot;<br>
<br>
And for the last he gave me a container which i need to find 4 Ores to combine and return the combined box to him.<br>
<br>
These are the items you need for this quest.<br>
<br>
1. Fusible Velium Ore - Guardian Kozzalym in western waste<br>
2. Fusible Igneous Ore - At loc Pos900, Neg1500 in Skyfire's ground<br>
3. Fusible Coral Ore - Phinigel Autopros<br>
4. Fusible Earthen Ore - Master Yael<br>
<br>
Result of this quest will end up as,<br>
<br>
Strength of Elements<br>
Shoulder Slot<br>
