In other words you have no REAL experience other then heresay... God forbid you ever play a wiz and learn what you are talking about. Better yet, god forbid you play a wizard level 1-51, and see how bad it really sucks sometimes, cause everyone wants a wizard in their group who has to med all the time.<br>
<br>
<br>
--&quot;In fact as a 58 rogue I've never ever had 4k hp no matter how many buffs I have up and wont at 60. What am I supposed to do hide under a rock? &quot;--<br>
<br>
Yes, live in fear of all 12 wizards who can manaburn so far at any time they want. Cause all us wizards want is to kill &quot;helpless&quot; rogues all day long.. over and over.. yep.. I have nothing better to do.. Oh look I have to wait a few hours till I can cast it again. Have to wait a good 15 minutes of med time(with clarity) before I can venture forth again... As you have siad soooo maaaannnnnyyyy ttiimmeess before, &quot;Move!&quot;.. Rogue heed thy own advice and quit dispencing such vaunted wisdom that you fail to use yourself.. Oh, If you are grouped like the spirit of the game is designed for, I would like to see that solo wizard MB you so your buddies can tear his mana-less ass apart. Problem of MB solved. Groups, what a novel idea.... And don't even suggest that 6 wizards with manaburn can go on a party killing spree.. The odds are the same as Cazic Thule being killed by a solo character.<br>
<br>
Quit yer bitchin, heed your own advice before dispencing more, and if you don't like it, move to a blue server so you can have that warm, fuzzy, &quot;no player can kill me feeling&quot;<br>
<br>
Eternally searching for &quot;helpless&quot; rogues to MB all day long to loot the 6 cp everyone carries on a PvP server so I can afford that gear from the Sleepers Tomb (if it wasn't NO DROP).<br>
<br>
Get a grip dude, chill out, play the game, and have fun.... if you aren't having fun, then what's the point?<br>

<br>
Fact is that once upon a time lvl 50 was a rare and special thing.  Same with 60.  Times have changed.  What some do in weeks others do in months.   Class specific AA skills are at this point at that very place where they are rare and special.  In the not too distant future they will be far more common.  As lvl 60 players clearly are.<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter how few or how many have an unbalancing ability (for now) anyway.  If unlimited CH bps were limited to only a small fraction of clerics would they be less imbalancing?  Could the same be said of any item or skill?<br>
<br>
Would you be ok with a skill that allowed rogues to do a 6k backstab that never missed?  No matter how few had the skill would this strike you as bs? I think so.<br>
<br>
The skill isn't balanced in pvp, verant admits that.  Even a MB wizard thinks its overpowered.  Not hearsay. Not people worried about their gear getting ganked but a player who has everything to gain from MB staying how it is in pvp.  What's that tell you?<br>
<br>
It's ridiculous and needs nerfing, period. However much it may look to you like a magic solution to all your current pvp woes (though ya know 60 wizards don't seem that weak to me but whatever)<br>

<br>
I don't dispute numbers because anyone can pull any number out of their arse and make it apply to a given circumstance. Some say MB does X amount, others say Y. Some say BS does X, others say Y. Your numbers are fine, because they are mostly unimportant untill you put them into a scenario. Which for you is always unbuffed, oblivious rogue, who is dumb enough to stand there and take it rather than play cat and mouse like a good rogue does vs. a fully prepared wizard with uber gear, full mana (cause all wizards are at full mana ALL the time... not). Now if we are going to make it a full comparisn (i.e. throw in Rogue's AA skills at same level), your comment's about BS having to be behind is null and void now. Chaotic Backstab AA ability lets you stab from any side. Now combine that with Duelist ability. Hmmm, any side, quad base weapon damage, backstabs. Now throw in the haste gear, attack someone and tell me after you get the jump on them the first volley of attacks (like how your wiz vs. rogue is when &quot;sneaky&quot; wizard jumps, the poor defensless rogue... role reversal time... Oblivious wizard vs &quot;sneaky&quot; rogue now). Ohyes, I can see my Damage shield getting blown off in one hit and taking damage. If you cant get 2 hits to land on a surprised as hell wizard (who is wondering WTF just happened)., you deserve to die. NO WAY CAN THE WIZARD SURVIVE THIS TYPE OF ONSLAUGHT. Wow! I have maybe, at best half life after one sucessful attack. And you have 14 seconds of discpline left if I am not mistaken. Combined with your chaotic stab you should have time for it to refresh at least once, if not 2 or 3 times with proper haste... Wow, if you get 2 or 3 hits in right away, wiz is dead. Much faster than the 6 sec &quot;instant death&quot; (as you call it) MB. Yes, you might miss enough to let that wizard slip away. Chances are the same that MB won't kill you either. Now I have to wait 2 hours and 24 minutes for it to refresh. You on the other hand wait 30 minutes (29 at level 60), find another wiz (or torment the one that got away) and try again... and again... and again... and yet again before MB is back. Yep, fair and square there. See, I don't have to dipute numbers or anything. You take very limited circumstances (wiz full mana, buffed to the gills with every buff under the moon of Norrath), so I will rebut with an equally innane circumstance of everyone does everything their class can do while enemy stands with a thumb up their bum (crying &quot;poor me! your overpowered cause your not a sure kill for me anymore! No fair! Too much challenge! Your risky to attack now!&quot;).<br>
<br>
<br>
--&quot;So you suggestion is its ok to make a class so powerful in pvp that no solo player has much of a chance? Because people can group lol? Your advice being either hide among friends or run in fear pffff or wait C, hope mr MB wizzie has more important people to fry than me. Nice choice.&quot;--<br>
<br>
See above rebutal and statements for most of this stupid statement. Any griefer that wants to ruin other peoples day, will, it happens (with many different classes at many different levels). Get over it. To be honest, if I go against someone who IS level 60, and has gathered enough xp to level from 51 to level 51 six times at least (5 for MB, and 1 for mental clarity requirement to get MB), and I haven't, I expect them to be superior in raw power (not neccessarily player skill, as that is different). Level 60 anyone vs level 52 anyone, level 60 should win 99% of time unless OOM, low on hp's...... So not unbalancing by that much.<br>
<br>
--&quot;Would you be ok with a skill that allowed rogues to do a 6k backstab that never missed? No matter how few had the skill would this strike you as bs? I think so.&quot;--<br>
<br>
<br>
Hmm disc of deadeye. Every attack hits if I understand it correctly (I could be wrong but I am willing to be corrected and admit I don't know EXACTLY how this disc works. Unlike you who have HEARD how all wizzy spells and fights are. If not still hit with every attack, with haste and low delay weapons, no channel for wizzy, wizzy have no life left)<br>
<br>
--&quot;The skill isn't balanced in pvp, verant admits that. Even a MB wizard thinks its overpowered. Not hearsay. Not people worried about their gear getting ganked but a player who has everything to gain from MB staying how it is in pvp. What's that tell you?&quot;--<br>
<br>
So all i have to do is find one person who thinks an ability is overpowered to justify everything I say... Easy enough. Level 60 Harmtouch vs level 52 wizard... death. gear lost (on gear loot server).. same thing happened, only much faster. level 60 rogue vs level 52 wiz, same effect... Circumstance is everything, quit whining, go to blue server if it worries you so much and you are having nightmares about it...<br>
<br>
--&quot;It's ridiculous and needs nerfing, period. However much it may look to you like a magic solution to all your current pvp woes (though ya know 60 wizards don't seem that weak to me but whatever)&quot;--<br>
<br>
Umm, yes.. level 60 rogues are weak. See first response at begining and above response. Yep all level 60's are weak. At least compare the same level to same level with same gear and same amount of disc and/or AA points. Really alters the facts a bit. More AA, means more powerful character. Period. With ALL classes.<br>
<br>
As for your pathetic response to splurt. Just as it can be dis-spelled to live through it, you can be buffed to live though manaburn. Except wizard has NO MANA (i.e. No gate, shadow-step, spells, DD's, Lure's) and has to resort to running (taken care of by dispelling sow, or having AA run skill) or combat (Hahahahahahahahahha! Yea, right.. miss. miss. miss. miss. You strike for 5 pts. miss. miss. miss. miss......).<br>
<br>
<br>
--&quot;Enjoy using it to gank 32k mobs.&quot;--<br>
<br>
And all the agro that comes with it against my mana-less self. Ok, You are right, not a single drawback to this tactict.<br>

<br>
From what I understand...<br>
<br>
Peacebreaker (high end guild on RZ) wizards mb does around 4k in pvp.<br>
<br>
Ascending dawn (highest end guild on RZ) wizards do around 6k in pvp.<br>
<br>
Individual people can of course be somewhat different than that.<br>
<br>
Next to refute your info about chaotic stab.  It lets you do a minimum bs from the front with no chance of double.  Minimum bs at 59 is 89.  It goes up to 120 at 60.  Not much of a pvp skill unless your oponent is backed into a corner. I'd rather not  waste a bs attempt. In fact vs casters a rogue doesn't get that much out of maxing their aa.<br>
<br>
They get to apply poisons faster though still not fast enough to do in the middle of a fight.<br>
<br>
They get to do a 120 (single not double) bs from the front.<br>
<br>
They get a small percentage more dmg via crits and slightly higher duel wield skill via aa. (should be between 5 and 10% and I'd bet more toward 5 personally)<br>
<br>
They get 10% more hp.<br>
<br>
They get to insta cure themselves once every 72 minutes (uber)<br>
<br>
Thats it.  Wizards on the other hand get a player DT and 2 get out of jail free cards that lets them gate off in 1/10th of a second.  Bet you can cast THAT faster than duelist kills and if you buy both of the insta gates you can do it just as often too.  Free loot and the ability to almost instantly run when things don't go your way. Among other things, fun...for you.<br>
<br>
Next deadeye is what rogues get at 54 and its far inferior to duelist.  Basicly you get 15 seconds of 1 and 1/2 x normal dmg.  It's awesome vs a snared person btw <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  But its useless unless your oponent is poisoned or is inclined to stand still and try to channel while you disc them (dumbasses in other words).  Completely. I never waste it on someone who is trying to kite. It does no dmg to speak of.<br>
<br>
Next how did I contradict myself by stating that one MB wizard had the opinion that MB was overpowered in pvp?  From personal experience.  I don't recall saying ANYTHING to the contrary.<br>
<br>
Next there is one hell of a lot of diffrence between needing to either mem a mid lvl dispell or keep a stock of pumice stones and needing full raid buffs to have a chance k?  Its ridiculous to claim someone is balanced because they can get a buff.  Might as well say nerf all melee dmg because the melees will be balanced with shissar. Please.<br>
<br>
In addition to that I never have 4k even WITH full raid buffs.  Let alone 6k.  So it remains an insta kill.<br>
<br>
As far as MB being nothing in a real pvp situation why don't you ask a MB wizzie if its nothing.  Maybe ask the PB wizzie who has I hear allready looted 3 dragon haste cloaks.  Then again maybe shes just that good.  Then again maybe not.<br>
<br>
Fact is no matter how well you play 60 people do get off 6 second spells.  I've seen wizards channel through a hell of a lot especially with skin up especially when the spell in question is classified as a lvl 1 spell as mb is.  Ever noticed its easier to get off a lower lvl spell?  Ever notice how much you channel gate(5 seconds) when a bash doesn't interupt, for example?  Oh but wait casting haste items going in.  MB will then be faster than current gate AND lower lvl.<br>
<br>
Fact is MB is horribly unbalanced and while finding joe blow to say its so the fact that verant says so means a tiny bit more.  It makes a 60 wizard into a pvp god whenever its up.  <br>
<br>
It goes beyond the normal realm of overpowering to let a single aa skill give a wizard a lure that is 6-8x as good as any before it without even taking into acount focus items.  Then to whine but but we're so downtrodden we NEED this. Ridiculous.  None of the bs you've spouted means much of anything.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself what kind of derision would the idea of pvp mannaburn have met with if suggested by a player.<br>
<br>
You would hear rational arguements about why thats too much and what really needs to be done instead.  If it didn't exist allready nobody would have entertained the idea that something this ridiculous would ever go in.<br>
<br>
Consider it that way and try to see it with the open mind you WOULD have had.<br>
<br>
Now we get hoards of low 50s wizards who find themselves worse off than pvp than once they were.  Getting the snot beat out of them by uber 60 melees.  They know nothing about melees or the limitations of same but they know that soandso with a primal smoked their ass in no time.  MB is the carrot dangled in front of their noses. Look! Here is the answer to all your problems!  Its a long road but after you get their you'll never have to feel inferior to an uber dope ever again cause you know with one tap of a button they can be dead at your feet!.  Fun? Yes.  Balanced? No.<br>

Yes, it came from the ass. Manaburn deals random damage. You are using the max damage. That would be comparative to a rogue on duelist quading and double backstabbing for maximum damage. Wich deals maybe 3k damage. Ouch, 1k less then manaburn?<br>

I think the general feeling on RZ (as in 99.9% of the population) is that MB is way out of balance.  This is obviously a view shared with verant as per certain statements on castersrealm by a verant employee. &quot;...totally broken in pvp.&quot;  &quot;...slipped through the cracks&quot;  The first is hearsay but accurate.  The second is fact.<br>
<br>
As far as the dmg done by mannaburn.  Give me a formula and a dmg distribution as I have with duelist attacks.<br>
<br>
I'd welcome the info.  I am of the opinion however that it will almost always be a death touch even at the low end.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming since its a lure and clasified as a lvl 1 spell that partial resists aren't an issue except in freak cases.  So what your talking about is your manna x a random factor possibly reduced by the pvp dmg modifier possibly not.  I have a feeling that it will be fatal in most cases. <br>
<br>
Its not that difficult a case as there must be lots of mannaburners spread out over all the servers even if they are rare on any given server.<br>
<br>
All we need is a number of pve samples to determine both the range of the random factor and the distribution.<br>
<br>
Then we need to for a few pvp samples at least.  The purpose of which is to determine if it is indeed pvp reduced.  The easy way to do this is to look for a single MB hit that is too big for a pvp reduction to be in place.  For example if the random factor maxes out at 2.0 in pve(as determined above). A single case in which a wiz with 3000 manna MBed a player for 6k non crit would prove no pvp reduction existed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukainite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kainite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/8/02 7:29:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=88>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Gosh, this is fun..</span><hr size=1> --&quot;Next there is one hell of a lot of diffrence between needing to either mem a mid lvl dispell or keep a stock of pumice stones and needing full raid buffs to have a chance k? Its ridiculous to claim someone is balanced because they can get a buff. Might as well say nerf all melee dmg because the melees will be balanced with shissar. Please.&quot;--<br>
<br>
I didn't claim someone &quot;needs&quot; to be buffed to balance. Merely made a braod statement that most, if not all 52+ characters, have a buff or 2 up at all times. Friends, allies, guildmates.... whatever. I presented my damage based arguement using YOUR own rules, but reversed who sat and did nothing, while being oblivious to what walked up, and failed to react to what was happening. I included AA skills that required the same amount of AA points or less than MB. Sitting with back to wall generally doesn't work well vs protection from BS. It is also impractical most of the time (unless I use the sit/stand bug to em-bed myself in wall, but that is a bug and exploit, therefor not usuable).<br>
<br>
--&quot;Next deadeye is what rogues get at 54 and its far inferior to duelist. Basicly you get 15 seconds of 1 and 1/2 x normal dmg. It's awesome vs a snared person btw  . But its useless unless your oponent is poisoned or is inclined to stand still and try to channel while you disc them (dumbasses in other words). Completely. I never waste it on someone who is trying to kite. It does no dmg to speak of.&quot;--<br>
<br>
So you can use this against that 6 sec MB (or DT, as you call it). Gosh.... your right you are defenseless. Wait till i am 2 secs into casting and unload this disc. I don't know about you, but geting hit with 100+ damage per sec (easily done with duel wield and decent 50+ weapons and haster gear to get delay down to max of 10, I believe that is the number cap imposed by verant irregardless of percent haste cap) means I will live really long trying to cast, let alone use my channel skill. While we are on channel, yes, sometimes i take 300+ and still channel, but other times I take 30 and get disrupted. Here's a hint, use fast hitting weapons, rather than one big hit. Each hit causes some knockback effect. More hits equal more knockback, hence more disruption. Part of the reason wiz duels can channel through the massive damage is because of the afor mentioned statement.<br>
<br>
--&quot;Fact is MB is horribly unbalanced and while finding joe blow to say its so the fact that verant says so means a tiny bit more. It makes a 60 wizard into a pvp god whenever its up.&quot;--<br>
<br>
So if I find Joe Blow and he thinks rogue is overpowered my complaint becomes justified...? PvP god indeed.. Anytime you are forced to flee or worry, you cry foul. Nevermind the cost or consequences. And if you get a rep as a MB wizzy, guess who becomes the most hunted being who becomes KOS to everyone? MB wizzy vs hunting squad of 3+ members... ah yes I will use my mythical channeling abilities. There are consequences to all actions... MB has the highest.<br>
<br>
--&quot;As far as MB being nothing in a real pvp situation why don't you ask a MB wizzie if its nothing. Maybe ask the PB wizzie who has I hear allready looted 3 dragon haste cloaks. Then again maybe shes just that good. Then again maybe not.&quot;--<br>
<br>
And this one time, at band camp.... Please name exact cloak and exactly how it was done. I know very few mobs that I can find with less than 6k HP that drop a cloak with haste. If over 6k HP, then MB wasn't how she did it. And if it is a Dragon... well, need I say more about MB on that.....<br>
<br>
<br>
--&quot;You would hear rational arguements about why thats too much and what really needs to be done instead. If it didn't exist allready nobody would have entertained the idea that something this ridiculous would ever go in.<br>
<br>
Consider it that way and try to see it with the open mind you WOULD have had.&quot;--<br>
<br>
I do, hence in my examples, BOTH sides get use the same AA skill points. As for lower level getting smoked by higher level. It's called higher level for a reason.. (i.e. level 55 anyclass vs 60 anyclass.. I expect to get smoked. Leve 55 anyclass vs Level 60 class with AA skills maxed, I expected to get smoked in a spectacular fashion)<br>
<br>
On a side note again... hehe.. I dare you to dispell a splurt by yourself before it kills you as a Int caster. Isn't splurt a poison based spell? It also has like 10 poison counters before it is dispelled.... Wizzy's? please include how many times you have dispelled splurt before dying on your future posts out of curiousity... Yes, this has nothing to do with MB in your opinion, thats not the point, hence the &quot;on a side note&quot;...<br>

<br>
The fact that you believe splurt is godly pvp wise, insta owns int casters, and saves vs poison simply servers to illustrate the fact that you are either not much of a pvper or a lowbie.<br>
<br>
As an int caster the proper way to go about it is to stack your buffs in such a way that there are as many open spots as you can conviently maintain at the top of your buff stack.  This allows you to dispell as needed.  All pumicable dots should do little or no damage to you unless you are running for your life and can't stop to dispell.  Splurt especially if you get it off pretty fast since it does almost no dmg at the start and increases with each tick.<br>
<br>
I bit of a suggestion fyi.  If you see any disc msg I would suggest you back off and kite till it wears off. No rogue disc lasts over 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
As far as the deadeye disc I hate to tell you bud but if I start whacking you 2 seconds into the spell and do 100 dps for 4 seconds that wont be enough to break through epic (or spell)skin before the MB hits.  Note MB is classified as a lvl 1 spell (check the spdat) and as such is easy to channel.  Gonna get easier with the caster focus items going in too.<br>
<br>
I will say this again, neither full raid buffs nor compatriots can be used to justify MB.  If you want to examine class balance you must look at realistic situations.  1 on 1 pvp balance is just that 1 on 1.  You are not suitably balanced because you can't kill 3 people at once or mannaburn a fully buffed n tov equiped char k? To claim so is absurd.<br>
<br>
As far as looking at chars with similar AA points.  Guess what. No skill I can get even with 200 AA points will do anything to protect me from MB.  It will still kill me.  In addition no amount of AAs will give me something like MB and don't give me that crap about duelist.  People don't all bag their gear when a duelist rogue enters the zone. It's not half as good as you seem to think.  The pvp gain from AAs for a rogue is minimal, a fractional increase in dmg, the ability to do a single minimum bs from the front, and a few nifty 72 minute refresh skills that don't make much difference pvp wise. The gain for a wizard is huge.<br>
<br>
With sufficent AAs a wiz can increase their dmg substantially, cast somewhat faster, use 2 different 1/10th of a second gates every 72 minutes, and nuke once every 2 or so hours for 4-6k pvp dmg.<br>
<br>
Basicly what you've got is a class that is nearly impossible to kill and gets a free kill shot every 2 hours via a ridiculously overpowered skill.  This will get worse with focus items.<br>
Thats balance? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umakyz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Makyz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/8/02 8:14:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whats the purpose of the 66% nerf</span><hr size=1> necros get lifeburn why dont you whine about that some rogueling?(sp?) <p>Makyz-58 Evoker <BR>

<br>
If you had taken time to read my post, you would notice the questioning part. But alas, you assumed what I said and twisted it into a statement of fact (for future reference, question marks means unknowing or unsure). Also where have I ever said splurt was godly? I simply made a statement about the amount of damage splurt can do ONCE before (and I never claimed it was godly, merely used it as a reference for spells that can kill in one casting). Yet again you assume and insert any word that comes from your limited grasp of what I posted. And as a final rebut against your childish statement, note the part that says &quot;ON A SIDE NOTE&quot;, followed shortly thereafter with &quot;THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MB&quot;. <br>
<br>
<br>

Splurt especially if you get it off pretty fast since it does almost no dmg at the start and increases with each tick.&quot;--<br>
<br>
As a wizard I can name all my buffs on almost one hand almost. See Inv, Skin spell, element buff (wiz buff is one spell only), levitate, manaskin (if high enough), and resist (again one spell), and shield spell (arch, magi, whichever you are using). Well losing see inv hurts when against rogues and inv casting classes, losing shield spell costs mana and hp (about a bub of each at higher levels), losing element buff or resist makes all spells affect me better (these are 30 pt resist buffs at 50+). Losing skin or manaskin means I lose all protection and go down to my less than 1.3k hit points at higher levels (using a broad number that is probably higher then actual). That leaves levitate as my only junk spell really, and it is quite handy and therefor not totally useless or junk depending on where I am fighting. Well there is my dmg shield spell that is useless... Familiars are a joke since the are melee targetable by PvPers (and it takes a lot of mana to summon one, not to mention fizzle rate).<br>
<br>
<br>
--&quot;I bit of a suggestion fyi. If you see any disc msg I would suggest you back off and kite till it wears off. No rogue disc lasts over 15 seconds.&quot;--<br>
<br>
FYI for you now. When you have a skin spell on, all hit messages are doubled (i.e one hit gets you 2 lines of text saying &quot;you have been hit--your skin has absorbed it&quot;, one after the other). Now combine that with dual attack and double attacks at a ridiculous haste level and the casting of pumice, golem wand or whatever you use to try to strip enchantments off right away. Can't imagine that spamming by...<br>
<br>

Pure utter crap. Yes it will disrupt, not ALL the time, but MOST of the time. If it flat out didn't kill with a good crit or BS tossed in.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Learn to read yet again. Never said it was required. Never claimed it. Said most 52+ people have buffs on at all times more or less. Your class PvP examples always have the wizard with the &quot;jump&quot; on rogue. I present the reverse to the destruction of the wiz. And you can do it (duelist) 4 more times BEFORE manaburn refreshes. In fact I never claimed duelist was unbalanced, or any rogue ability for that matter.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of your post, it has been dealt with in previous posts. Try &quot;Hooked on Phonics&quot;, a dictionary and a text on the defintition of a question mark. Preferably before insulting your own intelligence.<br>

Balanced you say?  PFFT<br>
<br>
Manaburn out of the picture, about melee versus spells.  The problem is that melee is 'unresistable' for casters, while spells with the exceptions of lures are easily resistable.  While melee saves versus AC, spells save versus resists, with average gear for a level 60, full buffs I can break 800 ac, and that's with shissar/coe, and even that's absolutely useless versus a high level melee.  What I think needs to exist to balance out melee/caster pvp at the high end (which is totally skewed towards melee) is that caster AC needs to actually make a very significant impact on melee damage.  It is currently impossible for any caster to raise his AC to a point where it even makes a difference in pvp, while any joe schmoe, with 10 k investment can buy a full set of BD/Diamond gear and laugh at all regular spells.  I think it would add an element of tactic if before going into a battle, a wizard would have to choose whether to wear hp gear to combact lures, resist gear, or ac gear.<br>
<br>
At level 60, a rogue will land most hits for maximum against a wizard, simply because a wizards ac is A LOT lower than the mobs a level 60 rogue fights as a baseline, so his damage distribution is extremly skewed up, making it so that moving from 600 to 800 AC would hamper a melee's damage output as much as going from 25 to 120 to all resists is IMHO exactly what's needed for pvp, not stupid insta kill skills. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/24/02 8:28:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At least I can read a question statement correctly....</span><hr size=1> Food plz Mearis <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvelaelsoulrender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Velael Soulrender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/24/02 4:14:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mmogamers.com/hate/ikonboard/avatars/joe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At least I can read a question statement correctly....</span><hr size=1> Fyvish (60 Primal Rogue) killed Cappadonna (60 epic wizard) within the casting time of Manaburn. /disc Duelist ... fully hasted that's 2 double BS rounds + God knows how much melee damage.<br>

<br>
Sorry melee dmg isn't so simple unfortunately. If most hits were really for max and few missed as is in fact the case with say lvl 20 orc centurions in EC then a rogue would do obscene dmg.  In reality casters aren't that much better nor worse off as far as mitigation and avoidance than velks spiders (45-48 about) While your AC may be lower your also a lot higher lvl.  In reality unbuffed bsing all the time I probably wouldn't do more than 70dps average vs the spiders. Keep in mind the normal figures you see for rogues are buffed as we do NOT solo worth shit.   Hitting most hits for max would put me between 200 and 300 dps a figure I'm quite sure I never achieve.  I will gladly verify this fact with you next time we raid together.<br>
<br>
I've found personally that there is also btw a definate difference between naked caster ac and geared caster ac too. Naked casters go down FAST.<br>
<br>
Also before I would care one bit about any issue mages may have there are a few ummm strategies you can use vs pure melee.<br>
<br>
Pet kiting. Run around in a circle while your pet does the dmg for ya. Casting optional.  Since the pure melee can't channel through pet dmg if the pet has expedience the melee can't debuff the pet.  If the caster just runs away the pet WILL kill the melee or force him to run.<br>
<br>
DS.  Use a DS potion AND your own ds then prevent normal dispelling with the simple trick of clicking to insta items.  Your own ds is actually suffiecent here if you don't want to waste the money.  Without wands the melee has as good as lost espcially if as a rogue they must duel wield.<br>
<br>
Levitate and block dispelling as above. Without wands you can't lose.  If your wanded run away and come back releved.<br>
<br>
<br>
LoS exploiting.  Made especially easy via /pet attack /assist<br>
<br>
Ghosting.  Do the circle jerk up and down hills till you ghost then cast at will.<br>
<br>
I would counter your ascertion that mages are unbalanced vs pure melee because you have no lures as wizards do with the fact that I and the other pure melee classes can't simply root your pet as hybrids do and its basicly an unresistable dot for the duration of the fight.  Made especially nasty if you choose not to fight much and let your pet carry the fight.  Whether you enjoy using all or none of the strategies above if they aren't adressed they ARE available to you and if not to you to more unscrupulous members of your class.  Balance must be based on what people can do not what nice people like yourself do.<br>
<br>
If you counter that pet kiting makes melees run I would say you should stop to cast enough that they think they have a chance but not enough to lose the fight.  Have fun.<br>
<br>
I would maintain basicly that vs a pure melee mages are perfectly viable in a real pvp environment and that rogue dmg is not in need of being situationally lowered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umearisthecowslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mearis The Cowslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/29/02 6:12:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In reply to Mearis</span><hr size=1> Aerimus, I am talking about in dungeon pvp, not outdoor pvp where melees take a huge disadvantage... also remember mages do not get absecond/shadowstep, so if you choose to use pumace I have no choice but to run, I cannot shadowstep and refresh skin like a wizard can, and if wish to root the pet just get some wooly silken nets, or dispell the sow from it and just ignore it...<br>
