Without clerics, melee's wouldn't do a fraction of the damage they do, they'd die. Enchanters haste, which adds to melee damage, and mez, which saves damage, which indirectly deals mucho damage. Clerics and enchanters are really the biggest damage dealers in the game, it's just that they have to channel it through melee's. Wizards, on the other hand, do almost exclusivly damage. Evacs are falling by the wayside, snares and root are nice, but are filled by druids or rangers. Although I must say that stuns are nice, I just wish I wouldn't have to wait till 49 for a friggin' upgrade))<br>
<br>
Exactly, we can do both direct damage and indirect, time saving damage. You can save over an hour of group time with a well placed evac. You can save CR time by watching how other players in the group are being aggroed upon (a cleric getting beat on by a MOB for example, you stun the MOB and root it), and by assisting the enchanter with crowd control and placement. We can also nuke and use Rain spells, so we can do both types of damage.  <p><P align=center>

 grimstaff get a clue, because you are terribly inconsistant with the information, lack there of?, that you spew.  Explain this to me good sir, why do you say Verant has caused the problem by bringing uber items into the game post kunark and Velius, but then you want to say &quot;Im glad lvl 60's feel balanced, its not about the uber game&quot;<br>
<br>
WTF? you talk about uber items and how tanks are so great and then you turn around and say you cant factor uber wizard items/levels into the equation.<br>
<br>
Get a clue plz, im tired of you trying to be OUR spokesperson.<br>
<br>
hell, you say logs prove otherwise that rogues out damage wizards.  I say, WHAT LOGS, what encounters have you experienced that you would need logs anyways?  Furthermore, Frozboz came out and put forth information about the insane amount of damage wizards can do, and how important they are for yelinack, etc etc. I think id have to believe him.  I wouldant know because my guild has yet to do Yelinack (yet), and i dont have DB, GD, but i trust Frozboz as a uber wizard representing FoH and Dark elfs in general /salute. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Anyways, ill tell you this.  My guild would be incapable of doing alot of things if it wernt for the core group of wizards.  4 60's and 3 Mid 50's.   just knowing that makes me even more enjoy being a wizard.<br>

<br>
I didn't say a thing about that, and you should know better.  Perhaps if you read what was said without thinking (like Bethude does) &quot;how is Grimstaff wrong here&quot; first, you'd see what I said.<br>
<br>
Uber items for melee have ruined the game balance across the board.  Wizards were, in my opinion, well-balanced against melee classes previous to Kunark and Velious.  To pretend the items that melee classes got didn't hurt the game and change it significantly not only puts you on the side opposite almost every player in the game, but Verant.<br>
<br>
What I said about level 60 uber Wizards with epics in Uber guilds is that too often they pretend the game is balanced because at level 60 they feel fine.  Even if this is true, it doesn't mean everything for the previous 59 levels is fine.  Is that making more sense?  I never even remotely hinted that you should ignore level 60 Wizard gear. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ualderonbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlderonBrell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/23/01 6:04:18 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: sorry I ruined your day</span><hr size=1> <br>
As a level 60 wizard with epic, manna robe, vp lure staff, vek robe and whatever junk they can give me, I have to say my contribution to battles SUCKS.  Any duel wielding tank easily outdamages me for almost anything.  Stuns dont work.  We never evac now.  Ok, I can spend time before and after raids getting people places but thats it.  Otherwise, a level 55 warrior can easily replace me in any battle and do more than me.  Every day I play it gets worse as tanks are still getting better and better stuff (next range of items are final kael pieces and sleepers weapons).<br>
<br>
As for logs, I have counted damage with tanks in my guild for many battles.  I never out damage them.  Period.  Often I dont  even come close.<br>
<br>
Are wizards useless?  No.  I am a good 2nd rate damage dealer.  I portal people around to battles.  Thats my role until verant changes stuff.<br>

Thanks, same here.<br>
<br>
And again, it is completly subjective, heh?<br>
Rogues do have a hard job, Samadhi? So, us Wizards do have an easy job? <br>
LOL, cmon, Rogues do have more HP than Wizards and way better AC. They are capable of hiting 100% of the Mobs in game.<br>
Btw, Samdhi Site Golems were only an example. There are now 99.999999999999% of the MObs partial or heavily resistant against Wizard's spells.<br>
What this means? Well, surerly Wizard can hurt Spite Golems (again an example) or most uber MoBs in SoV, but we can hurt them only in a pathetic way, while Rogues are way more reliable. (Rogues = Guaranteed damage, almost aggro free)<br>
EVery resisted spell is taunting and can cause major aggro. Aggro control beside not nuking doesn't exists. Concussion doesn't work on most Mobs that we are fighting at level 60.<br>
Rogue's Evade still works... and it works superior.<br>
<br>
So Rogue's do have an hard job? HELLO????<br>
And Wizard's job is easy?<br>
<br>
Wizards job is 200 times harder than the rogues job.<br>
<br>
Again, most 'Uberguild' don't recruit any longer WIzards. And that for a vey special reason, heh?<br>

<br>
~<br>
Something that I keep having to say, that makes me sigh inside every single time I see it is that not every single Wizard in the game is level 60 in an Uberguild with an epic in their fist. Saying that Bane or Sunstrike or any other single damn spell at level 60 balances the class, using that as an example of how things are fine is the most annoying thing that comes out of the mouth of Wizards and other players. <br>
~<br>
<br>
It balances the class at lvl 60 w/ other lvl 60s.  Who cares about force strike at lvl 20?  Furthermore, i never had trouble being useful in low to mid 50s, im sorry you do.<br>
<br>
Also,<br>
The argument in favor of Wizards doing well is always &quot;we can do 1293124 damage in 34.451235 seconds!! nobody can do that!!! lets see a rogue do 2k!!!!!&quot; And that is just silly. First off, logs prove otherwise, I have NEVER, EVER seen a log that showed the Wizard blasting as much damage as the best melee class, <br>
                          and<br>
The other side wants to say that Wizards are trash because Rogues can outdamage them using their best gear, that Wizards bring only damage to a group. The fact is, few rogues in Norrath can hope to do that absurd level of damage because it requires the ABSOLUTE BEST gear in the planet to try, and only at a certain level.<br>
<br>
I dont see your point really.  I guess your playing devil's advocate, but really everytime i read this it just seems like your spewing out a bunch of words, nothing more nothing less.<br>
<br>
Just adding this in:<br>
Oh, and I do attack people sometimes, it's childish and silly but I let my emotions get the best of me. <br>
   -if you read what was said without thinking<br>
   -that making more sense? I never even remotely hinted that you should ignore level 60 Wizard gear. <br>
<br>
Feeling childesh?  Attacking my inteligence?  /shrug<br>

How did this ruin the game?  Because you are trying to group with people who are more twinked than you?  Well That would affect more people than just wizards.  It would affect, Mages, Necros, as well as wizards.  This is not a wizard problem.<br>

If your talking about lvls 1-50, and were unbalanced after kunark, i REALLY DONT GET WHAT YOUR TALKING ABOUT!  Unless your twinked, how are you gonna have an item better than a fbss pre 50.  What is the differance between your balanced world before kunark for lower lvls and after kunark.<br>
The influx of better melee doesnt effect anything except post 50.  <br>
<br>
In a nutshell, the pre kunark game remains pre kunark. Nothing significant has changed with game design and ability of classes.  So if you say we were balanced before kunark (levels 1-50), then why do you keep bringing up &quot;What about the other 59 levels?&quot;  Why dont you atleast narrow it down to what about the other 9 levels.  And the fact is i do know what those lvls were like.  And when your lvl 53, your playing to achieve lvl 60.  THats when we should be the best.  Furthermore, i never really thought it was half as bad as people make it out to be, i feelt great being a wizard 51-59.  I feel awesome at 60.<br>

<br>
My guild has a Level 60 rogue who was originally a wizard Level 59 and does not play the wizard much these days.<br>
<br>
He will tell you flat out --- Rogue own wizards.<br>
<br>
1. They will get a group.<br>
2. They will outdamage you (wizard).<br>
3. They will get there epic easily(high damage-guild priority).<br>
4. They will get majority exp on raids and level faster due to this and item #1.<br>
5. They can do the high damage in any zone on any mob at any time and dont have a component cost attached or mob restriction.<br>
6. Sneak provides ways of doing certain (coldain ring and others) quest when KOS because you only need to be indifferent to complete it.<br>
<br>
It is not fair to compare wizard vs rogues they own us.<br>
<br>
In addition, at higher levels you dont go anywere and do anything worth doing without tanks, clerics and chanters so getting there (supposed) support group is 110 percent certainty along with having the best gear.<br>
<br>
Wizards need work from level 1 to level 60 banes dont even it out at all.<br>
<br>
Grim your on the right track and thanks for the level headed well thought out contributions you have made to help the wizard class.<br>
<br>
<br>
Im level 60 and dont feel like wizards are balanced compared to melee classes, but we are not worthless either. Level 60 spells do make it a bit better but we are still a distant 2nd place to melee's.<br>

<br>
Where's the haste item for Wizards, bro?<br>
<br>
Before you attack Grimsatff, you should read and understand his points.<br>
There is NO, i repeat NO item out there that gives us a 50%, 60% or 70% fatser mana regen equal to the Melee haste items.<br>
There are two items - now, after two years added to the game - out that will give you ONE point of additional mana regen and if you happy you get the FT II item, which will give you TWO points additional mana regen/tick.<br>
<br>
That equal ... say a 1% haste item. ROFLMAO.<br>
<br>
Even Ansor stated that this is NOTHING compared to Melee Haste. Get a clue here.<br>
<br>
We do not have ONE singlke item that increases or damage output significally. No Lure wand nor a Wlk robe or Rend robe (Rend robe = inefficient against uber mobs) is heping us to increase our damage output. So stop that silly discussion. You sound like you never played a Wiz seriously, else you wouldn't make such statements.<br>
<br>
Second, Surerly the game is ruined by all the uber melee stuff. Every blind men has to realize that.<br>
<br>
More melee output = tougher and tougher Mobs.<br>
Tougher and tougher Mobs = more Hp<br>
More HP = less and less efficient casters (especially Wizards)<br>
<br>
Not that those Mobs are most times highlöy resistant to ordinary spell casting, no, they react as well highly agressive against spell casters, quad hitting them for 800ish.<br>
<br>
Wake up, there is no reason to DEFEND the Wiz class. We lack seriously. Why not to admit that?<br>
<br>
And yes, to that point i want to add: Rogues own us.<br>
<br>
Wizards are fun to play. A difficult class to play, maybe the most difficult class.<br>
But a game should provide fun and the fun aspect of beeing a Wizard, standing around and trying all to lolk smart and productive becomes old.<br>
<br>
The WIzard class is nothing more than a shadow of it's original conception, that is: The conception of the WIz class in pre Kunark.<br>
<br>
Kunark and SoV ruined the game and teh class balance completly.<br>
<br>
If you want to do damage, then play a Rogue, Monk or Warrior, even a Ranger.<br>
<br>
If you want to talk smart and arrogant - closeing your eyes- then play a Wiz and check the comments on this board here.<br>
I am so sick of it.<br>

<br>
I think that pretty much sums up your attitude and why I say what I did about level 60 Wizards with uber gear in uber guilds.  Look at the 'how many wizards in your guild' thread and you'll see a direct correlation to both the attitude that low level players mean nothing and that Wizards are fine without need of work... and the uberness of the guild you belong to.<br>
<br>
For those of you who think caster gear and melee gear is equivalent and the game hasn't been damaged by (for example) 11/29 weapons being easily twinked to level 1 warriors... too bad, Verant can see it, and so do most other players.  <br>
<br>
Unbalanced does not equal 'stinks' Collossusa.  Unbalanced means unbalanced.  The first level 50 player in live Everquest was a Rogue, the most unbalanced, messed up class in the game.  You can succeed, enjoy yourself, and even work in groups while being unbalanced and in need of work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/unatanmagus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Natan Magus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/23/01 9:12:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rogues own us wizards</span><hr size=1> 12 20 hammer... exquisite velium hammer... nice weapon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The game is completly ruined...<br>

Most guilds tend forward to recruit more and more meleers of all kind. Desired casters:<br>
<br>
Couple of enchanters (to mana regen the CLERICS, not the WIZ)<br>
<br>
One Mage (COH)<br>
<br>
One Wiz/Druid (Porters)<br>
<br>
One Necromancer(CR)<br>
<br>

Nope, they couldn't. Some Mobs require massive and fast damage or your raid will get wiped out.<br>
Now all 'uber' guilds know that Wizards aren't any longer a guarantee for massive damage nor for fast damage.<br>
<br>
And the best is: No one would notice if some Wizards are present or not <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

TONS of Warriors<br>
TONS of Clerics<br>

A few bards (to feed clerics mana)<br>
