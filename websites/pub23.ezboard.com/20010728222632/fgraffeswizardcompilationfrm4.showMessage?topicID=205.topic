<br>
The dynamic of this game is, and will likely always be, that the pullers/melee are the focus of any group.   They are the contact points, where the “rubber meets the road” in any group hunt or raid.  In fairness, they typically have to exhibit the most situational awareness of the group, second only to enchanters who do crowd control.   This does not demean what clerics and casters need to know and do, but their roles are largely RE-active to the situation at hand, or are more player-focused (so-and-so needs a heal, a buff or whatever).  Non-melee members don’t create situations, they work within a pace set by melee to be effective (as opposed to leading raids, pulling, calling out assists, announcing moves etc.).   So in a Verant world where the melee is the QB, the “god” if you will, who has value?  Clerics certainly, cause they keep Mr. Or Ms. Melee alive, and anyone that can buff them, defensively or offensively, by enhancing Melee’s speed and effectiveness (this includes chanters and hybrids).  That a chanter can assist mana regen is sweet to a melee, but indirectly ‘cause they buff your cleric or hybrid so they can cast more of the above (wash, rinse, repeat).   Sure a chanter can crowd control too, which is great cause MOB#2 will wait to get his ass kicked while MOB#1 dies at the blade of my fiery two handed whatchamacallit.  Life is good!   <br>
<br>
Verant took all of the above and made it a preferred way to fight in the Old World, the best way to fight in Kunark and the ONLY thing that works in Velious.   (Can we make the MOB more difficult in creative ways?  Nah….just pump up the HPs).  <br>
<br>
Into this reality steps the wizard.  From a meleer’s point of view we at the top of the list among a very small group of classes that do nothing for them.  Now yeah, I know we can do all these great things that help the group, but here’s my point:  <br>
<br>
IMHO many melee (not all by any means) are childish (or are actually youngsters – and no - not all young people are immature but MOST are most certainly).  They want everyone to “ooh” and “ahh” at every little fucking thing they do.  “Nice crit!”  “Woot!” “Ownt” etc., etc.   Wizards, at BEST mind you,  don’t add anything to the greater good of the Melee’s abilities.  Remember, you may be grouping but most Meleer’s are starring in their own movie entitled “The Melee:  Or How I Kicked Wuoshi’s Ass All By Myself.”  <br>
<br>
We are a stage hand working to get the buffers and audience members in place so we can all adore the melee in all his/her technicolor glory.    <br>
<br>
At WORST, we are a competitor.  And here’s the awful truth.  Cleaning up on a MOB is often resented.  Yes I said it.  See you stole their big scene.  Never mind the MOB is walking away into 20 adds, a lot of melee are just infantile enough to want to finish him off.   Ever hear a melee’s idea of a mana check?   Particularly after you just burned down an add.<br>
<br>
Melee:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “Mana?”<br>
You:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “20m”<br>
Silent Bob the Cleric:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “80m”<br>
Bossy the Chanter:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp gtg<br>
Melee:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp “pulling”<br>
<br>
I’ve never understood why I, and the whole group, need to know that a melee criticaled a MOB for (137), but my 260 stun which lasts for 3 seconds doesn’t get a mention.   They don’t want you to shine, or proving they haven’t kept their taunt skill up, it just doesn’t “work” for them on a deep emotional level.   They resent it.   The EQ view of the wizard is largely a meleer’s view.   You add little if you are average, and if you are good you compete.     <br>
<br>
So my brothers and sisters, it’s a meleer’s world and this doesn’t look likely to change.   This doesn’t mean we should give up, but as Verant struggles to get us into groups with some yet to be defined skill or ability, bear in mind whose movie you are in , and who is the star of the show.   As long as melee lead and set the groups, and the tone, and run these shows, we will always be in the shadows.   Effective groups are not always the goal, good theater and human nature to want to be admired is what drives a lot of the wizard’s dilemma.<br>

<br>
However, as a group or guild progresses through the game, they develop ways to increase efficiency.  I feel fortunate enough to be surrounded by people who have studied the aspects of the wizard, and learned how to impliment them to where they actually compliment the melee class.  There is a level of patience that people need when exploring posibilities.  Now, is everyone going to take the time to experiment?  NOT EVEN CLOSE!  But at the same time, searching for those who HAVE build a respect for our abilities, is a search that is VERY rewarding in the end.<br>
<br>
You would think that we wouldn't have to work so hard to convince people that we are an asset.  But, as we have so many hardships, we as a class have developed a resourcefulness that FAR exceeds every other class.  We have learned how to do the most, with the least.  It isn't a pleasant ride, but we can only pray that all of us find that Utopia of people who see the skills and respect them.<br>

Let's face it, the ONLY times we do really well is when both an enchanter AND a bard are in a group with us.  Between Clarity 2 and Cantra of replenishment, mana comes back fast enough to be effective.<br>

<br>
In my opinion, and i do this frequently on new mobs like in WW dragons, this isnt stupidity but shows that a wizard has the presense of mind to do this with the intention of gaining valuable information and can take a death on the chin. Who else does that? I mean we generage a lot of agro, and I mean a heck of a lot. When you are doing a full burn, no way on this earth will 10 melees peel that mob off you.<br>
<br>
When i pre-warn my guild that i intend to overnuke and guage strategy, they know i will probably die, but they also know that its vital knowledge that I can pass to other classes.<br>
<br>
Yes, i do notice that melees are attention seekers in general, but they are also the centre of attention because they need to be. <br>

That post was a gem! I loved all the references to movies\films\acting etc. Very demonstrative of attitudes that you encounter. Your post also irons out the problem nicely and places it within a readable format!<br>
<br>
I once posted an idea for a type of spell that would work in a group setting only and would kind of meaningfully integrate us into the mechanics that you describe. The post, and the idea, like so many ideas involving new spells ideas, barely got a read from most. Most likely because they know that new ideas aren't the stuff that Verant staff meetings are made of. So why read about and discuss new ideas when they'll never see the light of day?  I see their point.<br>

Most of the time they seem to be much more educated and aware players than the majority of the casters I group with. Enchanters are an exception. Mages, Druids, Necros, all have their stories. Clerics just want to watch those 6 red bars and not be bothered. Shamans, well, no real complaints about them...<br>
<br>
I cant speak for most players, but when there is a Wiz in my group in guk, I know a Wiz is doing their job when the mana checks go out. I know that whatever they dont have remaining in mana went directly into the HP of what we were fighting. To me, thats good use of mana.<br>
<br>
What I cant speak for? Those 14 icons that I got from the druid/shaman/cleric that sit up on my screen and supposedly make me better. HP and AC is nice for a tank, but why does your Rogue always need to be at +1200HP +40agi +60dex +50cha(cha?) when she hasnt got hit for the last 2 hours? Spend that mana healing the tank so our pulls can come in faster please. Thanks =)<br>
<br>
With a Wizard, I KNOW their mana went into the mob. When I'm not having to run around like an idiot chasing the mob who runs after the wiz who dropped 7dd's into it and opened the book, I know they know what they are doing.<br>
<br>
When a mob goes aggro on the cleric, the Wiz is the first one to root it off. When 'inc' is followed by 25 frogs running in the room, the Wizard is the one who has already started their evac. Who do I want behind me dropping spells into Nagafen? You guessed it.<br>

<br>
It's nice to hear it back sometimes, but it's rare.  This gets back to my problem with battle spam, it's obvious to see what a melee is doing, becuase we see you and the MOB and the spam tells us (unless we've turned it off) of your effectiveness.  <br>
<br>
I think some melee don't make the connection that those big bubbles of HP coming off the MOB isn't built up and lagging melee damage reporting, but our nukes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   They also don't know who is rooting and stunning, even if I'm in a group with a cleric and a druid I usually insist on being main stunner/rooter.  1) they have better things to do, like heal! and 2) I have 3 stuns (soon 4 woot!) and solid roots, so I consider that to be my job.  <br>
<br>
Thanks again.  Nice to know the appreciation can be a two way  street.<br>
