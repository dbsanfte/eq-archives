But this debate is a waste of my time. I'm arguing with a rock right now, both in terms of how much you're moving, and how dense you are. No matter how many of us come forward with points about how more guns = bad, you haven't changed your fundamental point, which is that you &quot;need a gun to protect yourself.&quot; That's utter bullshit, because there's millions of people in NA and Europe who've never held a gun in their hand, let alone own one, and they all seem to be surviving pretty well.<br>

I never said that I always need a gun to defend myself.  But I *do* need a gun to defend myself against other people with guns.<br>

I'm glad that you study the martial arts, Aurianne.  But if I'm standing 10 feet away from you and I'm pointing a gun at you, would any of your martial arts training be able to save you from my bullet?  I'm honestly curious if you know any techniques, since you might study some funky stuff that I'm simply not aware of.  Maybe you could fill me in on how your instructors teach you to win fights against people with guns?  In this hypothetical confrontation, the gun-wielder is at least 10 feet away.  Might as well make the gun-wielder smart enough to understand that a gun's primary advantage is range.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As my coworker puts it, &quot;the feeling of need for a firearm is a sign of cowardice.&quot; You think you need to hide behind a 9mm barrel with 17 magnum hollowpoint rounds in the magazine because you are afraid to actually confront those who accost you, and you are not confident enough in your own abilities to realize that there's far better solutions to conflict than violence in any form, even that implied by the presence of a gun.<br>

Just because I own a gun doesn't mean I want to solve all of my problems with it.  Just because I own a gun doesn't mean I will use it to perform a crime.  I agree that violence should be the last resort in conflict resolution.  But to suggest that violence *isn't* a way to resolve conflicts is naive.  <br>
<br>
As for &quot;hiding behind guns&quot; because I'm &quot;afraid to actually confront those who accost [me]&quot;, that sounds very much like a &quot;fight like a man&quot; argument.  Let's say that I'm not trained in martial arts, but I do carry a handgun with me.  If I'm assaulted, I should put the handgun on the ground and fight with my bare hands because I should &quot;actually confront&quot; them?  What does &quot;actually confront&quot; mean?<br>
<br>
I have tons of family in Ottawa, Aurianne, and I lived there for nearly six years.  I'm a dual American-Canadian citizen.  My parents are Canadian.  Can we go out for a beer?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Brahma Atman

<br>
I know that if I were a panicked individual, or a criminal, pointing a gun at you and I saw you reaching for a gun in your pocket, I'd shoot. Without even thinking, I'd put a bullet in your head if I thought for a second that you were going to point a gun at me. That's the whole point I'm trying to get across to you: putting a gun in your hand makes you feel falsely confident.<br>
<br>
As for the range on a gun? Capitulate. They demand your wallet, so give it to them. I have defense techniques for disarming people with guns, but I can't control the Force and disarm them from a distance. If I absolutely feared my life, I'd try to get them to trust me enough to get close enough for me to disarm. But I wouldn't even worry about that, because there's never more than $20 in my wallet: I do all of my transactions through my Mastercard or Interac. I carry a cell phone, and can have both cards cancelled within 2 minutes of their being stolen (yes, I remember my M/C number and expiration). My life is worth a hell of a lot more to me than $20.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes. It is a &quot;fight like a man&quot; argument. Everybody should go through self defense training, at the very least. Having acquired high level belts in Jiu Jitsu and Tae Kwon Do, I feel far more confident in my own abilities than I did before I started, and have learned a great deal about how to deal with situations where I'm accosted. The point, however, is that you shouldn't fight at all, if you can avoid it. One of the first lessons any true Sensei of martial arts will teach you is that the martial arts are for use only when you have no other choice. Likewise, if you're mugged at gunpoint, you should let it happen. If you feel overconfident because you have a gun in your hand, you are more likely to attempt to bring down your assailant, and if you're at the distance you propose, he's quite likely to see what you're doing and shoot first.<br>
<br>
<br>
You seem to have missed the fundamental point of the 2nd paragraph that you've quoted, just as you all have missed my fundamental argument against firearms. So let me quote it for you.<br>

This is all true.  Most people aren't quickdraw artists who can beat a readied gun-wielder.  My example was unfair since the gun-wielder already has the upper-hand against anyone with or without a gun.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The case of a mugging is not really the best one to illustrate why gun-ownership advocates feel that it's important that people own guns.  It might seem far-fetched to you, Aurianne, but the whold &quot;defend myself against the government&quot; thing is really a primary motivation.<br>
<br>

<br>
Why can't that self-defense training be with a gun?  Let's say that I spend 5 years learning how to shoot a gun and how to use a gun in situations where I'm accosted?  To go back to our earlier mugging example, you mentioned that you have techniques for disarming an attacker if you can get close enough.  If I've trained in defensive gun use for 5 years, it's likely that I've learned ways to draw and use my gun in sneaky ways that an attacker won't expect.  Let's assume that such defensive gun techniques exist.  Would you deny responsible citizens the right to choose that form of self-defense?  Or does everyone have to make the same self-defense choices that you make?<br>
<br>

<br>
I assume that you don't feel overconfident in dangerous situations because you've trained yourself on how to handle them.  If I take 5 years of gun training, it's reasonable to assume that I will also avoid overconfidence in similar situations.<br>
<br>
If someone untrained in firearms use is overconfident in a dangerous situation and makes a mistake, it's exactly the same as someone who is untrained in hand-to-hand techniques making a similar mistake of overconfidence.  <br>
<br>
Even if a person *is* overconfident because they carry a gun without the proper training, any mistake they make will be their responsibility.  It goes back to this simple idea: just because someone is going to make an idiotic mistake doesn't mean that I will.  It is unfair to restrict me because of something someone else might do.  As I said in another thread, if someone use their car to kill someone they don't like, should you and I lose the right to drive?<br>
