Skip to the row of asterisks to get to the point = )<br>
<br>
Balancing the wizard class is a very complicated topic. As a wizard's only limiting factor in ability to solo is running out of mana, it is extremely difficult to deal with. We have all the equipment neccessary to solo. Root... Snare... and personal teleports should the mob get on us. Combine those with high yeild damage spells and we're very efficient at soloing. Increasing that mana pool would make us the kings of soloing, as we would be able to take out even higher level mobs, which the mana cap prevents at this point. <br>
<br>
I don't know about anyone else, but my desire is NOT to be the kings of soloing. I just want to be valuable to a group. As it is, wizards are simply NOT valuable as combat support. All we are is last minute saviors (And even then, at later levels, you don't evac. It's just stupid.) and taken along because we make it easy to send others off a raid when they go to sleep/get tired with translocate. In my opinion, what we NEED for class equality is some form of GROUP SUPPORT. <br>
<br>
&quot;But group support isn't what the wizard is about&quot; you may hear some people say. Well... this game is NOT single player oriented. I think we all know that. And fact of the matter is, if you don't have a place doing group support, and you aren't being supported by the group (AKA Tanks and the like), then you don't have a place in this GAME. And that's where we fall right now.<br>
Every single class has some form of group support available to them. For example (In Alphabetical order):<br>
<br>
Bards: Self Explanatory. Clarity, buffs, hastes, debuffs, plus some ability to melee.<br>
<br>
Cleric: Pretty obvious too. Unequaled heals/rezz/buffs in terms of HP. Also has major resist buffs. Also can fear. Groups HAVE to have one of these to function.<br>
<br>
Druids: Secondary Healer, Damage Shields, SoW, Buffs, tracking.<br>
<br>
Enchanter: Clarity, Haste, Resist Debuffs, Melee Debuffs, Resist Buffs, Crowd Control. Also a required class for group functionality.<br>
<br>
Magician: Melee Pet Damage (aka secondary tank), Damage shields, summoning of mod rods/pet weapons/coldstones/waterstones, COTH<br>
<br>
Monk: Big melee damage. Feign death also makes monks the KINGS of pulling. Required for planes/high level raids. Diciplines<br>
<br>
Necromancer: Melee Pet Damage (Aka secondary tank), Hardcore Dots, Debuffs, DMF, Summon Corpse, Fear.<br>
<br>
Paladin: Melee damage/tank. Has limited heals and resist buffs. Can assist clerics in that role. Also has lay hands... which is very useful in a pinch. Diciplines.<br>
<br>
Ranger: Melee damage/Tank. Has minute heals and limited druidic abilities. SoW. Also has tracking. Crits with bow. Diciplines.<br>
<br>
Rogue: Biggest Melee Damage. Awesome scouts/guides. Lockpicking makes some high level zones much more pratcial. Backstab. Diciplines<br>
<br>
Shadow Knight: Melee damage/Tank. Pet, unfortunately, isn't worth a damn, so that won't be figured in here. Do have harm touch however, along with necro spells and can now Summon Corpse.<br>
<br>
Shaman: Unequaled melee buffs. Speed. Regen. SoW. Secondary healer. Pet isn't worth much but damage is damage.<br>
<br>
Warrior: Meatshield. Melee damage/best tank. Greatest array of melee skills and abilities. Crits. Crip blows. Diciplines.<br>
<br>
And then there's us. The wizards who can:<br>
Port and do a capped amount of damage (based on mana).<br>
<br>
I think the problem is obvious.<br>
<br>
The solution, however, is quite elusive. Some argue our mana pool should be raised. I disagree. That just increases the cap. The same is with mana efficiency, raising damage, and these level 60 &quot;bane&quot; spells. <br>
<br>
(That's another topic alltogether... level 60 spells that are usable by maybe 1% of the wizzie population do not make up for the other 99% deficiencies. That's like the government giving a tax break only to billionaires. It accomplishes nothing, just enables the people who've already made it enjoy the game more.)<br>
<br>
So what's the solution? You don't honestly think I came here just to rant without actually projecting a solution? That would be border hipocracy.<br>
<br>
This is what I have been answering that question with for so long. <br>
<br>
******************************************************<br>
<br>
My proposition is a new spell line. I know this is something Verant has wanted to avoid, as it would breed class envy. Too goddamn bad. I think we deserve it.<br>
<br>
This spell line would start at a very low level.... say level 4. Get rid of Okeil's radiation and flickering flame.. (as these are totally useless anyway) and add this spell line...<br>
<br>
It's basically a reverse damage shield. Instead of doing damage to the mob when it hits the player... this spell would add EXTRA melee damage to a player's swing. Sort of reminicient of the fire/cold/poison/whatever damage on weapons in Diablo.<br>
<br>
In theory it would be the wizard channeling his power through another. The duration would need to be about the same as a damage shield, and the aggro produced would be associated with the wielder, allowing them to do more damage and create more hate, with the added benifit of allowing wizzies to nuke more during the battle. This has been described as a proc by others... however it musn't be a true proc. It would need to go off EVERY Time the wielder landed a successful hit to be anywhere near effective.<br>
<br>
Sample rates of damage would be perhaps 4 extra damage at level 4, up to say 40 damage at level 40. At this point tanks are dual wielding and/or double attacking, and this could add some serious damage. Perhaps scoring double damage for 2 handed weapons (so as not to throw off balance between dual wielding classes and non) and wound need to also be able to effect monk hands.<br>
<br>
This is completely unabusable, as it does not assist soloing by any means, and if you think this at a high level would throw off the lower level game, who the hell cares. It's no worse than a shaman giving a lower level any of their high level buffs.<br>
<br>
There is only one problem I can forsee. That it would enable smaller groups of characters to take larger encounters. This is true. The overall output of damage would be dramatically increased, especially if each party had a wizard to enhance the tanks. But again I say to this... don't you plan on introducing new content anyway? Why worry about the life span of the game if you're just going to make things harder?<br>
<br>
Anyway... I honestly think this would be the answer to the wizard balance problem. If you honestly disagree, please post why.<br>

We would technically be &quot;Channeling&quot; our power through another.<br>
<br>
But it's not only that.... you may say this looks like an enchanter spell but the fact of the matter is, what do you want more? A wizard that is true to his nature, yet completely useless in the game? Or a useful character, desired in groups, with an ability that can be interpreted as something a different class &quot;should&quot; have.<br>
<br>
I'm completely open to other alternatives. I DO like the new translocation spells, as this will make it much easier for wizzies to help out other players. On the other hand, they do continue to pound us square pegs even further into the round holes labeled &quot;TAXI&quot;. *sigh*<br>
<br>
Aside from that, I cannot think of (Despite how I've tried) another alternative to turn wizzies from the one-shot wonders we are into a lasting group benifit, in which our damage is not reliant on our mana pool.<br>
<br>
Please share your thoughts.<br>

And as far as &quot;slaps in the gonads&quot;, tell that to the wizards who have had their respective &quot;Gonads&quot; stomped, slapped, punched, crushed, ground, and generally abused by the groups who will shout to the zone &quot;Starting group at campXXX, accepting Tanks, healers, bard/chanters and pet classes&quot;.<br>

<br>
light healing potions exist, yes?  make mana potions to give back mana instantly, poof no more mana regen problems, and something to do with all that wonderful cash from TLing folks.<br>
<br>
the other options all have something to do with increasing mana regen one way or another, lowering mob resists, or *gasp* making that post 35 debuff crap a reality...  instead of just having wizzie spell resists nerfed pre-35.<br>
<br>
an ATK buff line would make altogether too much sense...  ignore that we can't exploit it by using it on ourselves soloing since we still prolly won't be able to go toe to toe with anything in the game past 20, we can't cast it on our pets when we solo (pet? what pet?  i have a floating eyeball! his name is a mystery) and uh...  well, if anyone else can think of a way ATK buffs would increase our solo power, you've more ability in the thinking than i.<br>
<br>
and heck, every spell level there's some spell that i say, &quot;what baboon smoking crack and beating keyboards with his forehead came up with that garbage?&quot;  take all them out, or half of em (every other spell level) or just take out al kabors.  i'm sick of telling people i'm allergic to the runes for those spells... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=taibamaragor>Taiba Maragor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/19/01 12:35:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Intelligent, REALISTIC balance to the class.</span><hr size=1> this is a great idea. if they have already &quot;fixed&quot; our dmg output(bane spells... need i say more?)at least give us something to help out the class(es) this game seems to based on now. Melee'ers. So we can feel useful.<br>
<br>
Something you may want to consider on that original idea...<br>
<br>
Instead of it just going up by 1 per lvl. have it start off very low, and have the multiplier for the original damage based on your channeling skill. And for those people at verant who would say that this would make us far too powerful, then heres the fix.<br>
<br>
The spell would drain your mana for the duration of time that it is on, and at a higher rate for the higher the damage you are adding to the attack. This whole line could have special effects at each spell lvl such as a stun effect, etc.<br>
<br>
Its truly sad that in order for us to be even somewhat balanced we need to be reduced to a &quot;melee support&quot; class... but since this game is now all about melee'ers, thats all we can do in verants mind.<br>
<br>
(ps. i would imagine that for those wizards who had maxed channeling (channeling's purpose should probably be changed, or a new skill added for this line), a special ability in this spell line would be to empty your mana bar, and unleash a power so great upon the weapon of your tank class that you would be knocked unconcious, and the tank would hit for a massive amount of dmg)<br>
<br>
<br>
just some ideas. tell me if its not realistic...  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=132.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=114.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=127.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=127.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=127.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=127.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm11">Velium Chill of Al'Kabor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm6">Tome of Ages Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4>Rant Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
