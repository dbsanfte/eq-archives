<br>
ae groups are great. some of the best times i have had playing the class have been spent trashing charsis. i dont think its a very practical solution to people complaining about trying to find a group. i have never participated in or even heard of a pickup ae group on my server. every time it was planned in advance and like like pretty much every other group depends on having the 2 most sought out classes to form it around. the only times i have seen enchanters and clerics unable to find a group is when for some reason there are far too many on or that particular person has a horrendous reputation. i know many enchanters that are on anon not to keep from getting requests for clarity but to reduce the number of random invitations for groups. <br>
<br>
well i seem to have wandered a bit but basically my point is yes i agree that wizards have more options than most classes but i dont agree that you are giving a true solution. personally i avoid pickup groups/raids like the plague and try to organize things with friends ahead of time. honestly that is the best way to get a group and to really enjoy the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulimdul.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LimDul</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/01 2:36:23 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.lava.net/~toasty/pictures/limdul.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This board always crack me up...</span><hr size=1> I'm my eye, it comes down to this: Verant did not do a good job defining their vision of &quot;balance&quot;; right now it seems no more then the idea that the numbers look the same at the end of a battle.<br>
<br>
The only thing I've heard them claim is that EQ is was to be designed as a group game (forget the solo game for this discussion).  Under that assumption, balance is a very subjective idea based on what people perceptions of what each class can bring to the table.  All else being equal (guild memberships, friends, MoBs, etc) we all know that there are some classes more popular then others.  <br>
<br>
So if you use the &quot;group game&quot; as a litmus test (as Verant has asked us to do so many times before)...wizards and a number of other overlooked classes will continue to be unbalanced until our abilities are more clearly defined and emphasized; be it damage output or otherwise.<br>
<br>
As much as I like the new gifts that VI gave us in the form of Translocates and Banes...I don't think it falls in the category of making us any more group oriented; at least not to the same degree as a melee damage dealer or a healer.  I think these spells may make our life easier and possibly more fun, but I have a hard time seeing any correlation with the group game vision.<br>
<br>
So the questions should simply be...ignoring any rules of damage caps and such, what would it take to make us as equally attractive as a cleric, rogue, or enchanter?  That's why many people will continue to post here with their frustrations because VI continues to cloud this question with other issues....<br>

I think that the issue is one of controlling our groups with our abilities. The comment about making ae groups is less true than the follow:<br>
<br>
Get in groups where you (the wiz) is used for more than a taxi. Thats up to play style not our ablilities. For example, Im maxed out in all my combat skills and habitually have a speed and Howler on from our chanters. Its pretty interesting and effective to go melee a mob that wont just die off the top and do 1-2k damage on top of your DD. This is against everything you are taught about wizzies and it works like a charm. Spend that 215 mana for the draught or just whack a sub 20 critter til it dies?<br>
<br>
Or the converse is true - be the puller for the group. With jboots and a Floox Staff we are marvelous pullers. In a fit of boredom some months ago I pulled for 8 straight hrs at the Burning Woods giant fort. Admittedly I was high enough to solo pull but I was dragging critters out to a party fast enough that they and I both leveled with very little effort at all. Not even a chanter. Just pull em and drop em.<br>
<br>
AE groups are much harder for me to find as we seem to have more chanters than we know what to do with. My chanters wont C2 me if I break their rez. So its a delecate task to drop a pillar that will kill one and whack on the other 1/2 of a normal pull.<br>
<br>
Finally, there are things that could be done to enhance the class but what we have asked for isnt it so far. Any suggestion that has the word &quot;solo&quot; in it should be ignored. Soloing sucks. <br>

<br>
If wizzies, as a class, were half as balanced as you say we are then we wouldn't have a tenth of the difficulty LFGing as we do. <br>
<br>
Recall, please, that this IS a coerced grouping game for many many reasons. VI has been very clear on this in implementing so many design decisions over time.<br>
<br>
Quad-kiting and all of the tactical developments in that regard are probably the result of the wizard class being unable to get into groups!!!  They forced us to solo. No wonder we get a rap for KSing and kudos for our &quot;innovations&quot; in solo tactics. <br>
<br>
My best guess is that you have developed a rep on your server for being a master KSer and have even a tougher time LFG. So, with it being fourth down and a mile to go, you PUNT and resign yourself to a loners lot of endless soloing!<br>
<br>
Alot of us would be repulsed at such a choice.....SO, please stand aside while those of us with a desire to make EQ a &quot;Social&quot; event attempt to talk sense into VI and get things balanced for this class. <br>

It's a reality. We LFG forever and a day. Intellectual integrity requires that you ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. Could everyone, ceteris parabis, be wrong about wizards...OR, possibly, amazingly, just maybe, they arrived at their collective conclusions as the result of an eminently rational process whereby they determined that wizs just dont keep up with the damage over time of the other classes?????  <br>
<br>
Could all these people actually be rational when refusing wizards membership into groups??????<br>

Second, Quad Kiting is sort of an aberration, and regular experience grouping is, well, ordinary.  That's like comparing a dragster to a your car on the street.  Is the dragster faster in the quarter mile?  Hell yes.  Is your car faster in the ordinary roads of life?  Hell yes, Dragsters have like a 500 foot turn radius.  Does that mean they are 'balanced' out?  Not in anyone's demented dreams.<br>

The fact is, Wizards need to be useful and as good in a group as any other given class... not CRITICAL but a valid choice when you consider all their alternatives.

<br>
First to answer Gon's new post.  You launched a personal attack on me claiming I had to solo becuase I wrecked my rep by KSing.  So, yes, the quality of player I am became an issue with you and you alone it would appear.  So now don't try and bail out of your immature remarks.<br>
<br>
I didn't learn to quad because I had to, I did it because it's a lot of fun.  I love the challenge of it, the skill and finesse of getting the four baddies to drop.  Especially the first time I pull a new set of mobs I have never quaded before.  The same is true for AoE groups.  I don't do them because I have to, I have lots of friends that I do regular groups with.  I do AoE because it's the best times you can have in the game.  Killing Trak or Zland is fun, but not very personal, takes too many people to feel like it was you who did the killing.  But, an AoE group functions like clockwork, laying down 50-75% of every casters mana to take out a pile of mobs.  When the six of you see that 10th mob fall, everyone breathes a sigh and laughs.  It's crazy, very intense, and a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
Wizards are very group friendly in AoE groups.  You should try it.  Half the groups are normally wizzies.  If you can't think outside VI's narrow idea of what a group should be, then you deserve to wallow in your wizzy self-pity.  All the personal attacks on me will not get you into another boring seb group, so what's your point.  I'm pretty sure I laid out how to get out of that hole you keep putting yourself in, so why don't you try it instead of yakking about stuff you can't fix.<br>
<br>
Now for Grim's post:<br>
<br>
I keep saying that being in a regular group is pointless to begin with, so why do you keep bringing it up?  The answer to your grouping problem isn't quad, it's AoE.  Quad is for solo action, AoE for group, don't confuse the two remedies.  Your problem with my solution seems to be based on your lack of effort to even attempt it.  The only reason more people don't AoE group is because nobody takes the time to try it.  Once people do AoE groups, nothing else will make them happy.  The exps you get from AoE are 2-3 times what a normal group can make and a heck of a lot more fun.  You can't quad frogs in seb, but two AoE groups in seb can burn down every frog from the bar and chef in 45 secs.  Other camps used to howl at us for taking all the critters because every 3-5 mins we needed another dozen to torch.  Our personal best pull was 17 critters in one pull (with two groups).  I'd love to hear of others beating our record.<br>
<br>
Quading isn't an aberration, it's a tactic.  Why sit in one spot all day and easily burn down one thing at a time when you can sit in one spot and kill four at a time?  You can quad in any outdoor zone with the spells we have.  There isn't one wizard who is good at quad that would ever go back to solo pulls.  I've quaded in SK, EK, OOT, TD, BW, SF, and DL.  I quaded so many guards, they nerfed them, but I figured out a way to quad them anyway (they raised the MR so BoF wouldn't stick, but I could still outrun them with jboots by just enough).<br>
<br>
What's normal anyway?  2 years ago I was a heretic for saying you could quad kite.  Now, every class with a good AoE and snare does it.  Probably everyone reading these boards has seen some wizzy or druid doing it.  Wasn't &quot;normal&quot; two years ago to kite that way, but it is now.  Only thing that changed was people listened and tried it.  The same will be true with AoE grouping.  Sure, now it sounds almost mystical, but it happens all the time.  The only thing keeping it from being the &quot;normal&quot; way to group is people trying it.  Just like solo folks who quad won't go back to single kiting, AoE folks will want to AoE all the time.<br>
<br>
As far as balance goes, AoE groups gain exps 2-3 times as fast as a standard group.  If anything, wizard dominant AoE groups are too powerful, but I'm not saying anything to VI and I doubt anyone who does AoE will.  The only drawback to AoE was always making the other exp camps mad from taking all the spawns, but AoE is very efficient.<br>
<br>
Now, for the last section of the my last post in this thread.<br>
<br>
So it comes down to what wizards are willing to do.  Some will just sit back and write the never-ending gripe to VI and cry them a river hoping VI will change something so we'll fit better into their &quot;vision&quot; of groups.  Others, like me, will figure out a much better way to level and have fun.  If VI ever gave wizards something to make them fit into a stadard group, I still wouldn't do them.  They are too boring and the exps are way too slow.  Hey, it's your 10 bucks a month, if you want to beg to get into a group for your money, who am I to stop you?  As for me, I expect some good times for my cash, whether VI likes it or not.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwraithwavefeaamael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wraithwave FeaAmael</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://keith.vaughan.home.mindspring.com/img/ball3.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/01 5:30:09 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This board always crack me up...</span><hr size=1> You will get no argument from me on the fun of the AoE group.  The only problem on my server is, there aren't enough people willing to put the time in to learn.  They happen so rarely that it is discouraging to even try.  I mean, I WILL keep trying, but that is the problem.  There just isn't enough interest.  Which I find interesting because it is BY FAR the most exciting aspect of the game for ANY class.  (taking out MAJOR mob raids which sometimes not very desirable.)<br>

The answer to your grouping problem isn't quad, it's AoE.&quot;<br>
<br>
I can give you several reasons.<br>
<br>
1) You can't really do good AE grouping every level, in fact until level 20 Enchanters only have one AE stun, and mes isn't especially useful for this.<br>
2) AE spells are scattered through levels and not consistently useful.<br>
3) Not everywhere can sustain AE blasting<br>
4) This is not a tactic 90% of the public can or wants to do<br>
5) AE grouping isn't possible in many of the places people like to hunt or for things people like to get<br>
6) This game isn't about my needs and desires it is a grouping game, I can't force everyone to play one way just to make me happy or fit in<br>
7) AE Groupin is just as unusual and non standard as the usual group and as such fits in the quad-kiting concept.<br>
<br>
I like AE as much as the next, more than most.  You should know by now that I am one of its biggest supporters and proponents.  The problem is, most Wizards even don't like it and are scared of it.  How, precisely, can you expect the game and the classes to be balanced by something like this?<br>
<br>
Saying &quot;go do AE&quot; isn't the solution, and Verant recognizes this.  They are working on other things for the class, because they understand that isn't the answer.  Don't dismiss peoples' concerns about this because you can get into regular AE groups, that's not standard in any remotest sense of the word for this game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uqwade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qwade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/01 10:23:31 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hey Nizzdal</span><hr size=1> Actually the population of Clerics/Chanters willing to do AoE is growing on Lanys.

On The Nameless, there have been many times when I'll look around the zone, and there are less than 3 wizards total.  I'll look around OS, check Trakon's Teeth, wizards are nowhere to be found.  <br>
<br>
So, no wizards means AoE groups are suicide.  Wizards AoE and cast MUCH faster than the other classes and because of it, on the &quot;boss mobs&quot;, it takes multiple wizards.<br>
<br>
That's the key to our problem, wizards become stronger the more of us there are, but by ourselves, we end up with problems.  Form a group, make sure there's two instead of one wizard, and watch the mobs drop so quickly the tanks blink in surprise.  Do this consistantly, the wizards don't end up out of mana, the mobs drop very quickly, and people scratch their heads.<br>
<br>
Tanks can do well in a group without other tanks as long as they have enchanter and cleric support.<br>
<br>
Clerics do well in a group because the other classes need their heals.<br>
<br>
Wizards need other wizards, and one enchanter to be the power people see in the class.  A single wizard in a group doesn't have the mana to cast frequently enough to take down mob after mob when in a group.  Two wizards, even without AoE tactics will drop 10k hit point mobs VERY fast, and because they share the agro with the tank(s), generally have fewer agro problems when chain casting.  Our strength is when we work together, and perhaps the best solution is to push for two wizards to a group.  In raids, when the call to nuke comes, it's the power of multiple wizards that drop the mob quickly enough to avoid agro.  If it's a single wizard pumping lures into the mob, the wizard dies from overagro since the mob doesn't die fast enough.<br>

There is more than one way into a castle my friends.<br>
<br>
I quad kite and have fun with it.  Spirocs are still giving me XP and frankly it's fun.<br>
<br>
AoE groups however are a different story.  I have been a strong proponent of AoEs since I got my first good one.  But, I always hear this, &quot;Don't use and AoE!&quot;  My response to this is, &quot;I don't tell you which weapon to use, Buckethead, don't tell me what to cast.&quot;  Then I have some asshole thanking me when he overpulls and I'm there burning them all.<br>
<br>
Right now, at 48 my AOE's just aren't good enough to take down mobs all the way.  CoF rocks, but ideally, I'd like to have one with a wee bit more power.<br>
<br>
I have no problem soloing, I chat in my downtime and take care to manage my mana.  I like AoE groups when I can get people who understand them.  I just got my lvl 52 Shammie husband to like it.  The XP falls like rain and group members do love it.<br>
<br>
However, I am in a minority.  I had two high level wizards to show me how to do things and to help me get my timing down.  I am forever grateful to these guys, Pucel Greyone and Skinn Wilwarin, for all the help they have given me.  They have been there to show me that I can get groups, and really, I only want to group with people who will respect my strengths and my weaknesses.<br>
<br>
Alot of people cannot read kite instructions here and then apply it in game.  They have to be shown and then try it out themselves until they get it right.<br>
<br>
I'm only as limited as I allow myself to be.  If I cant find a group I go solo, if I have sow potions. My husband may make them, but I have to buy the stuff for him to make them and that's not cheap folks.  I've camped the AC numerous times and have yet to get a ring for the boots.<br>
<br>
Don't castigate people for not taking undue risks.  Why bother snaring mobs you can't outrun?  Why die any more than you have to?  Different people have differing styles of what works for them. <p>Severine <BR>
