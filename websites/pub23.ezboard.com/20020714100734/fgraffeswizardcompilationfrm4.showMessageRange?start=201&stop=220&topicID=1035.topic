In the event I were having company at somepoint(children) you can be damn sure that I would take it up on myself to secure my weaponry/tools that would not be appropriate for children to have access to.

Why does it have to be Secured to the level YOU deem necissary?  You are not at my house, Your children are not at my house, basically it is none of Your damn buisness How I keep my firearms provided I take Reasonable Precautions(locking the doors to the house, keeping the weapon out of view.

<br>
This statistic from a Reuters article which was PRO gun control.<br>
<br>
Over the TEN year period 1988 to 1997, 1,782 children died to accidental firearm deaths AND SUICIDE in all 50 states. This is an impossibly small number over that time frame for the entire country. Further it includes ALL forms of suicide (i can only assume to speciously make the number larger) so the number of children killed in real firearm accidents is lower.<br>
<br>
This means the actual accidental rate in the entire nation is no higher and probably much less than 178 per year.<br>
<br>
Compared to the total number of murders in 1998 or 16,914 the number of children that died can be assumed to be reasonably close to 1% of total murders.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But more importantly, I'm not sure what this has to do with the concept of trigger locks? - Grindel<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That the murder rate is 100 times higher than the risk of child death due to firearm accident means the wise parent will be concerned about the greater risk to their child.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Are you disagreeing that there is a correlation between trigger locks and lower incidence of accidental firearm deaths? - Grindel<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No. Although I am aware of no study showing this it seems reasonable that it would have some affect. (though children can find keys too)<br>
<br>
What I am saying is that the risk is already incredibly low compared to the risk that the gun is there to help you protect yourself from in the first place, and the trigger lock will mitigate a gun's effectiveness for that purpose.<br>

Statistics previously quoted indicate certainly they did a decent job in the 10 year period studied. In 1988 66 million guns were floating around in the US, but less than 178 children died accidentally. This means that your real risk of accidental child death is approximately 0.0000027 % per gun.<br>

Not at all. I love how people love to act like statistics cannot be trusted yet make claims about the efficaciousness of gun control. Well then how do you know? Omniscience?<br>

In the real world we have to measure things to know if and how well they work. My data was deliberately from an anti gun source. I'm sure you could find different data that less supports gun control. Do you really dispute my conclusions?<br>
<br>
As for suicide? First that's not strictly relevant since someone bent on suicide has many more means at his disposal than firearms and furthermore can easily circumvent a trigger lock given time. The only reasonable purpose of trigger locks is to prevent accidental firearm injury. It will have minimal to no effect on determined activity.<br>

No, what you are saying is that the risk of dieing from an accidental handgun death is small compared to the risk of being murdered.  But that is not the relevant statistic.  The relevant statistic is the number of accidental handgun deaths compared to the number of deaths that handguns have prevented.  And even then, it would only matter if the death was prevented in a situation where there would have been no time to get the lock off.<br>

I do not have a child, but I am forced to pay for and use child locks on medication bottles and lighters.  On the gun, you wouldn’t even be forced to use it.  The cost of the lock is small compared to the product, but if that still upsets you, then I would say they should at least be sold next to the gun.  The option to buy and/or use one should be apparent and easy.<br>

I’m not saying guns alone kill people.  But this is also a comparison between two very different societies.  While there is validity in showing that it is possible to have a high number of guns in a safe/peaceful society, it does not prove that guns make our (US) society safer.  I could point to Northern Ireland to counter that example (but again, N Ireland is a drastically different society than ours).<br>

That’s a valid point.  But I’m talking a basic competency test here.  Pretty much anyone who wants to get a drivers license and who does not have any physical or mental problems that would prevent him, can get one (though some people need to take the test more than once).  I’m talking about the same kind of testing for your gun license.  If your willing to take some time to teach yourself how to use a gun, you’ll pass.<br>

It is virtually impossible to complie accurate statistics in the gun control debate.  If someone SUCCESSFULLY uses a gun to defend themselves/deter a crime, they usually don't consider themselves victims and therefore these types of incidents usually don't get reported.  <br>

Certainly that would be nicer. But as British pointed out there is no good way to measure this. Any data must necessarilly be from polls and you will say that's just hearsay, and therefore no one ever protects themselves with guns.;P<br>
<br>
But the murder rate is still relevant since it is a known risk. The risk of a child dying form accidental death is also a known risk. Given the known risk of being murdered it seems reasonable that if someone wants a gun to protect themselves, and knows the LOW risk of a child accidentally dying do to accident, that they would not compromise their protection based on the very low risk of accident.<br>

 - Raise your hand if you actually believe criminals purchase their weapons through Legal means.  Maybe the first time.  We already DO a background check for the purchase of a Handgun, we already DO a background check for the issuance of a concealed carry permit(for those areas that have them).<br>
So all you have left is taking guns away from everybody else.<br>

BUT, I will note that I am not proposing a BAN on guns.  I hope that some day we will have one, but our society is not ready for that yet.  It would need to be more of a collective decision.  What I am proposing are ways of slowing down the influx of guns and limiting certain types of guns (guns that, for example, can be easily modified to accept silencers, or easily converted to fully automatic), and needing to get a &quot;gun liscence&quot;.<br>

No you are trying to evade facts entering the discussion. Please do go ahead and find your statistics. I got statistics from the opposing camp, but you feel free to get them from anywhere you like.<br>

A position I agree with, and is another reason I don't think suicide is very relevant, since the state probably has no ethical standing in a persons own decision of whether he continues living or not.<br>
<br>
In any event if trigger locks are to prevent suicide then should we not also protect people from all other methods? For myself I would certainly OD on a nice narcotic.

All you could do was gather data saying if a gun locked weapon was present at the scene of a murder or not. And then you would not know if they tried to use it. And you also would not know if there was one and it was stolen.<br>
<br>
However my case does not hinge upon whether a gun can prevent crime. (appeals to intellectual honesty having failed) My case hinges on the fact that gun control has not ever been shown to be efficacious in reducing crime in any city, state, or nation that has tried it.<br>

I am using your form in another context. Note I never said you contended my reconstruction. I was just saying your basis for your contention also allowed my reconstruction, which it DOES. I'll make it simple for you, do you now back away from the contention that a stopgap measure in general is legitimized SOLELY by the lack of a complete solution? Or do you believe maybe that a solution must be judged on it's own merits. If you believe the latter then what happenned to the justification for your statement?<br>

No that is not. My point is that your solution to this problem will not work, has been shown to not work where it has been tried, and opens the door to far larger problems.<br>
<br>
I think that you have typical American hubris and touching American optimism that we can succeed in doing what other nations have been unable to do.<br>
<br>
However the opposite: that more arms DOES seem to correlate with lower crime has been shown. In fact this has been demonstrated INSIDE the united states by the crime statistics in those states before and after concealed carry laws went into effect. NOT ONLY THAT there is positive correlation between NUMBER of concealed weapon licenses and lower crime. (IE if they have the law but not many people use it it does not seem to help as much)<br>
<br>
Does this prove that more guns == less crime? By no means. (although this debate is going on)<br>
<br>
But it is a very convincing argument that less guns &lt;&gt; less crime.<br>
<br>
Which I think is pretty much all I need to show to get you to leave my damned Bill of Rights alone<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Raise your hand if you actually believe criminals purchase their weapons through Legal means. Maybe the first time. We already DO a background check for the purchase of a Handgun, we already DO a background check for the issuance of a concealed carry permit(for those areas that have them).<br>
So all you have left is taking guns away from everybody else. - Melcar<br>

<br>
The availability of guns on the black market is related to the availability of legally acquired guns.  Some are imported, yes, but many are purchased here legally, and then make their way to the black market.<br>

Guess what, Our legal system still works on the Principle of Innocent until Proven Guilty. That means When you BREAK a law you get your rights restriced. You do not get your rights taken away because of Your Potential to break a Law. - Melcar<br>

Uhmmm, lets see…. Napster.  Ruled illegal because of what it CAN be used to do.<br>
<br>
But Napster aside, there are plenty of laws that are in place to ensure the safety of the people regardless of if they are law abiding or not.<br>
<br>
-Seat belts.  You may be a very cautious driver, and you may have health insurance, but you are still required to wear one.<br>
-Motorcycle helmets (maybe this is a state law, I’m not sure).  Helmets are required because so many cyclists were getting hurt and did not have health insurance.  This cost the government a great deal of money, so they began requiring helmets.<br>
-GPS.  The government requires that all civilian GPS receivers have an imbedded code to stop them from working if they travel too high, or too fast.  This is so they can not be used by someone to make a guidance system for a missile.<br>
-Drugs.  Your not allowed to have them, even if you promise not to use them.<br>
<br>
What about weapons on airplanes?  Would you go so far as to say we should all be allowed to bring guns on the plane with us because we are “Innocent until Proven Guilty?”<br>
<br>
The problem with applying “Innocent until Proven Guilty” with guns is that you are not proven guilty until someone is dead.<br>

Well the US Supreme Court had rules that you do not have a right to be protected from crime. The police have a duty to attempt to apprehend and punish criminals. But they have no duty or responsibility to protect you beforehand.<br>

So no rights have been invaded.

Your use of quotes .. &quot;personal right&quot; .. doesn't cancel the fact that we still do at present have a legal right to bear arms.<br>

I must admit, this idea is a seductive one and sensibly appealing.  But it does contain an implicit premise that isn't so rock-solid, IMO.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The implicit premise is that there is a significant number of individuals who are committing these kinds of impulsive gun assaults and murders.  The idea is that we're stopping this particular kind of &quot;impulse murderer&quot; who hates someone enough to kill them, but will only do it if they can get speedy access to a gun.<br>
<br>
Let's say that you and I are having an argument that's strong enough to warrant you killing me.  You decide that you want to kill me, so you get in your car, drive to the gun store, buy the gun and ammo, drive back to where I am, and shoot me.  You admit that if it weren't possible to go down the street and buy a gun, you probably wouldn't have killed me.  While you can argue that this type of thing is *possible*, it's not likely.  If you hate me enough to stop what you're doing and buy a gun so you can kill me, you're probably also willing to wait the 30 day period or simply strangle me on the spot.  It's an enduring hatred, not a &quot;spontaneous homicide hatred&quot;, if you follow me.<br>

This argument assumes that in order to allow people to drive a car, you HAVE to license them to do it.  It's just as easy to imagine a world in which everyone simply drives cars if they are able.  If I were to take your license away from you, would you suddenly lose the ability to drive?  I don't think so.  Giving people drivers licenses doesn't prevent accidents, does it?  It's a bit odd to suggest that people would never have any gun accidents if they just took a simple weekend course.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

A decrease in motor vehicle fatalities is a good thing and should be applauded, but people shouldn't have to pay for restraint and brake systems that they don't want.
