If one was used I am certain my oponent would have had the brains to disengage till it expired in roughly 15 seconds. Though I am confident that I would have been able to get the initial round of combat + bs before that.  Chances are however high that if it really did enough dmg the wiz would simply yonder and wait for a better oportunity to kill.<br><br>No golem wands were used in this engagement because the target had yondered and recast epic when I had tried that shortly before.<br><br>Some time was wasted trying to do dmg with non lure spells that could have been far better spent on lures.<br><br>Voltaic was attempting to spell spam me to lag me to gain an advantage that way but it wasn't having a signifigant effect.<br><br>Info...<br><br>Spells cast by voltaic 4 interuped by me 0.  Lead time per spell after the first cast from a distance was around 2 seconds.<br><br>Spell dmg...<br>Sunstrike-Resisted, lol fluke there<br>Lure of ice- 561 dmg<br>Soloist ice spear- 357<br>Lure of ice- 534<br><br>Total 1482<br>dps 67<br><br>Total dmg by me- &lt;800 dps 36(guessing)<br><br>Why so low? Simple he's not casting the entire time he's moving too.  When he's not casting I'm not able to hit him cause he's on the move. In addition there is a short space between him starting to cast and me starting hitting him.  So I am only able to for example hit him for 2.5-3 seconds out of a 4.5 sec cast or 2-2.5 out of a 4 second. My total dps while hitting him in this case was probably around 70.<br><br><br><br>In conclusion he in this log is basicly hurting me twice as fast as I'm hurting him and with epic skin and good armor he probably has as much if not more dmg absorption than I do.  Removing a wizards epic skin outdoors becomes basicly impossible as its very very simple to yonder off and reapply it wasting no manna.  Not true of skins that require manna as it will burn through the casters manna supply (and plat).<br><br>I estimate I would be able to do about 1k dmg to him before he killed me if we had continued on, a substantial portion of it would have been absorbed.<br><br>Indoors it would have been possible to to golem wand him knowing he wouldn't be able to yonder and reapply and there would have been less lead time between spells.  60 wizards are however by no means underpowered outdoors.  <br><br>Indoors ya still have gate and lvl 4 spells basicly never get interupted (except by death) without bash.<br><br><br>-----------LOG BEGINS-----------<br><br>Apr 12 21:16:25 2002] You resist the LowerElement spell!<br>[Fri Apr 12 21:16:25 2002] You resist the LowerElement spell!<br>[Fri Apr 12

Your log only shows 1 time where Voltaic is casting it, and it fires off, the time difference does not prove much, since it could be anything between 4 and 5 seconds, but you have to agree that if he has a damage bracer, he prolly has a shortening time thing item ;p<br><br>Also for your information, Voltaic has AA spell crits.<br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1.9 seconds per casts means roughly 6 seconds of melee time for 3 casts.

Sorry my mistake.  He still could have stuck with lures and killed me before I broke epic skin and i was backstabbing. Once right at the start of the fight.  Then another 11 seconds later.  I decided it was prudent to run like hell rather than try for the 3rd because I was getting pretty low.<br><br>You can't always get bs off the very second it refreshes.<br><br>Save your made up figures for someone who doesn't know shit.<br><br>Fact: with room to move and with focus haste a 60 wizards lures are not interuptable by my melee dmg.  Both my weapons are 18 dly hasted.<br><br>Fact: with focus items it isn't neccesary to be hit very much for each spell that goes off.<br><br>Fact: outdoors you can always yonder and reapply epic, always.  If you don't get far enough on the first try then yonder again.  Your intended target may choose to leave the zone of course or bandage or click his hp up but this still means that any successful attempt at killing the wizard outside must include knocking your way through their epic skin if applicable.<br><br>Fact: wizards do a lot of dmg quickly<br><br>Fact: wizards are not underpowered in pvp outdoors with rogues.  I would venture to guess the only people they would be deemed underpowered against would be people that cause them to run oom.<br><br>I'm rather tired of the poor caster routine when the supposed underpowering only comes about in cases in which the caster runs oom.<br><br>The simple solution to this is to make casting effeciency items as available as melee haste items.  If this results in overpowering wizards in boss mob type encounters give boss mobs a magic type defensive skill such that casters remain at whatever given lvl of power vs boss mobs that is deemed apropriate.<br><br>Defensive is btw a warrior skill that absorbs some set fraction (40%) of melee dmg taken by the warrior. Example statue of RZ hits the warrior for 1000.  Warrior takes 600 dmg.<br><br>Understand that I am not in any way for reducing wizards dmg vs boss mobs.  Just noting that the defensive ability vs nukes might be used IF neccesary to reign in caster dmg IF wiz dmg to boss mobs was increased too much by effeciency focus. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/14/02 6:32:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Those damn underpowered wizzies. *warning short log file</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You can't always get bs off the very second it refreshes.<br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>I don't understand?<br><br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Save your made up figures for someone who doesn't know shit.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br><br>What I am saying is in a situation like this the rogue's greatest asset is getting off a backstab because that's what does a lot of damage, and my point is, while wiz and you are running around, your BS is refreshing, which is nice for you, and will up your DPS is you see what I mean.<br><br><br><!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fact: with room to move and with focus haste a 60 wizards lures are not interuptable by my melee dmg.

The top 20 will be the the ones who spend the most time doing just that, and being moderatly good at it. Anyone who spends alot of time doing anything else then looking for new victims wont be on the list. Just killing people you randomly meet wont get you on any top list. The only thing this list realy shows is what class those who wants to do this prefers. Druids are the obvious answer with both ports and track. Even it had some meaning, then rogues are better in pvp then alot of classes and equal to rangers and shadowknights. The information gained from this statistics is far too insignificant to draw any of the conclusions you have. Just consider what if a rogue was now a position 21 and the 1 sk got out of the list.

It's called ragebringer...<br><br>15dmg 25dly 100hp 20str 10 sta 10 agi 10 dex 20pr 20mr 10 dr The effect (worn) grants the wielder 40% haste (stacks with spells but not inate haste items) and 40atk.<br><br>With 40% haste it is a 15 dmg 18 dly weapon. Thanx info.  What really makes me laugh is the fact that all the good stuff is low dly.  Lower than epic in fact. With delays generally ranging from 17-22. <br><br>&quot;It doesnt mean offensive classes are generaly unbalanced. &quot; Did I say they were?  I said they were strong in their environments.<br><br>The biggest thing pvp needs is for cheapo exploits and bs that real pvpers wouldn't touch allready to be nerfed without harming the legitimate tactics. Oh and to have certain AA skills get the hell out of the pvp environment.<br><br>They then need to look at pvp intensely and fix some imbalances and ridiculousnous that effects all classes melee and casters included at different times and in different situtions.<br><br>Then they need to look at the ridiculously broken item loot setup they have now and realize it is in need of major revision because skilless ganking, cheapness, and cowardice shouldn't be the best path to material gain (or point gain for that matter).  Its just bs.<br><br>To claim that you need DT, exploits, or cheapness to pvp as any class is to bring grave doubts forward as to your competence as a pvper.  I would hope you would be in agreement with that.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/19/02 8:00:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: rofl</span><hr size=1> Ah, that explains it.

Strong offense and weak defense like rogues. Warriors with their huge hp have great defense but weak offense.

The point is, if a wiz ran around with gear, he'd have lost it all pretty fast. That's why they run around with nothing, and get stuff when they kill people. Is it fair? No, but up to you to chose the way you want to PvP, be it by risking gear and having a slight advantage to using it, or by going no risk, and possibly losing some effectiveness.<br><br>Are wiz the perfect PK-Ebay class? Yes I agree. Do wizards fit my view of balanced PvP, in so far as they have a chance against every class, no not at all. The PK-Ebay wizards are simply using the best tool for their ends (ie get loot off players regardless of the number of times they die themselves.<br><br>This is quite a different discussion from the fact that wizards are good in PvP or not. I don't call dying 10 times and killing 1 monk and looting a fungus tunic a class balanced in PvP. I have my views on PvP; and Sullon is imo the best PvP server from the ruleset, because even if they are scoring points, those wiz are taking the deaths (albeit small with xp res but still) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ullyapakadeabn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llyap aka Deabn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/21/02 9:11:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pffffff</span><hr size=1> Aerimus wrote: &quot;Wizards have always been the favored pk class on RZ.&quot;<br><br>Wizards are a favored pk class primarily because they can solo, and they can transport.
