<br>
you are comparing a 60 wizard w/ epic, Sunstrike, and Lure of ice to a lvl 58 rogue?<br>
<br>
Aerimus, if you are going to do a test, at least make it fair.  Not all wizards have 2 levels on their opponents (being lvl 60 vs 58 is practically 3 levels its that good), have Lure of ice, and Sunstrike.<br>
<br>
I have been level 60 for maybe 1 month approx.  I do not have my epic.  I do not have Lure of ice.  I do not have Sunstrike.  Why do I matter?  I just want to let you know that these things aren't exactly sold off vendors, and not all wiards have them.  Just like not all rogues have a fungi, primal weapons, lvl 60, and money to use golem wands a lot.<br>
<br>
Try comparing the average lvl 58 wizard to yourself, then come back with your sweeping I-told-you-so declarations.<br>
<br>
edit:<br>
Oh yea, your opponent had focus items too? Hehe, I usually do not have focus items on me by the way, and I play on a PvP server too.  Yet another advantage to your opponent you seem to shrug off.  If your opponent has focus items (and is not a mage), then you would need spell haste to balance your duel out. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujeshuah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeshuah</A> at: 4/22/02 12:07:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ullyapakadeabn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Llyap aka Deabn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/02 12:18:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=21>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hehe, you appear to have missed the point all together</span><hr size=1>      Read a bit closer and you will see that Znail didn't actually mean rogues were the favored pvp class, but he was just useing all of your wacky statements from the end of your previous post with rogue and wizard terms and experiences swapped. As far as class power against skilled oponents I didn't comment, but we are not at an advantage against prepared Warriors, Monks, Necros, Sk's, Shamans, Druids, Clerics, Paladins, Bards, or other Wizards, and I am sure I am forgetting a few. If the class of pkers was based on what class they could play to win the toughest fights, you would see more war/monk/sk/paladin pkers.<br>
<br>
     Aerimus said: &quot;As far as there being no balance here well wizards are good at killing by suprise. You might say that this is balanced by something of a disadvantage vs a prepared oponent.&quot;<br>
<br>
     It is VERY rare that I am suprised I was attacked. If you are usually suprised by and unprepared for pvp, you are some sort of ignorant sucker, and deserve to lose some gear.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/22/02 10:37:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> well</span><hr size=1> The point is, even if you know there is a possibility of getting manaburned when you zone into Greater Fay, there is not much you can do about it.

Bottom line is that it's up to you to defend yourself.. you play on RZ after all.  You should always be aware of your surroundings and prepared to fight at all times.  Sometimes you're not going to have a chance to win the fight, but that's just the way it is, and that happens to all classes (trust me, it happens to wizards all the time).  PvP has a lot to do with luck in EQ, always has been.  Sure, with better gear, lvl, and skill you improve (sometimes drastically) your odds, but it still boils down to how much will this spell hit for, or how much will my melee do.<br>

The points board was generally dominated by level 30 - 40 druids who could snare people around there level range because they had poor MR.<br>
Once you land a snare on your opponent the fight is all but over.  After opponents get decent resists though, snare will hardly ever land and makes things much more complicated.  A monkey could be trained to kill a snared opponent.  With the advent of manaburn, level 60 wizards found that burn, instagate, then reapply 2 hours later was a very effective tactic to gain points and involved little to no risk at all.  While the points board does not indicate who is necessarily the *best* pkers on the server it does indicate who pk's alot and is somewhat effective at it. <p><img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/Chris+Cojocar/fullsize/horse.jpg" border="0">
