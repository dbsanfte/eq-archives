Thought it would be fun.  High Elf follower of Solusek Ro.  Then I find out after a little playing that due to my racial choice I am stuck being of a good alignment.  Due to my racial/deity combination I am stuck being a neutral good character.  That does not all all jibe with my concept this toon.  Excuse me but if I want my High Elf to have some chaotic tendencies and be more evil I should be able to make that change when the character hits 10th level (when you are allowed to change your alignment).  Yet according to what I read I am unable to.<br>
<br>
I can understand restrictions due to class (no evil paladins, thank you) and deity (those Tunare worshipping druids should be stuck with alignment 'lame') but race?  Gimme a break, start at the neck...<br>
<br>
I am sorry but I had some high hopes for this server.  As it turns out I can better RP on my existing server.  Unless this is changed I don't see any real place there for me.<br>

always hate folks that took a &quot;good&quot; race and wanted to play &quot;evil&quot;.. and vice versa.<br>

<br>
there are plenty of npc examples of races that have bucked the trend of their society and changed 'alignment,' why not allow pc's that same option?  i was more interesting in being chaotic neutral, something i feel is in line with a sol ro worshipper.  that way i would feel more comfortable chumming around with my fellow sol ro buddies.  is it so unfathomable that a high elf could be anything but good?  apparently...<br>

<br>
Try something different for a change.<br>
<br>
And as far as race having to do with alignment:<br>
<br>
First, alignments are stupid.  They shouldn't exist.  They are supposed to just describe your character, not confine your character...but they confine you anyway.  Get rid of them.<br>
<br>
Second, race does have a lot to do with alignment (if you use it), simply because if you're raised in a &quot;good&quot; society, there's a damn good chance you'll be good.  If too many people play a &quot;good&quot; race but use an &quot;evil&quot; character...the race isn't &quot;good&quot; anymore.  How many tree hugging Dark Elves do you know, for instance?<br>

Heh.  It has nothing to do with you not playing like I would.  It has everything to do with you doing what so many other &quot;roleplayers&quot; do when creating a toon.  You create the most self-serving toon possible just so you don't have to limit yourself with eithics.  As a GM, I hate it when players default to this mentality.  Play however you like.  Just don't expect to be viewed as unique or a &quot;trend bucker&quot; if you go this route.<br>

yeah i want that toon to be self serving.  after all i only get to have one on the server.  imo, it fits well with a sol ro worshiper.  period.  end of sentence.<br>
<br>
ethics aside (you have no idea how i would play CN, i do have some morals thank you very much) i fell if i pay my $10 a month, have a valid justification for how i am going to rp, then let me have at it.  so i will probably have to go solo most of the time, fits my schedule.  will you like it?  what do i care?<br>
<br>
i wanted to be able to hang with dark elves if they rp it right.  or humans.  even gnomes for crying out loud.  to make a toon more neutral based would provide me the flexibility to do just that.  again, i don't see shunning my fellow sol ro'ers just because of the color of their skin.  would it be easy?  no, the language barrier would prevent that.  but if i put _my_ time into it then where is the problem?  <br>
<br>
i am sorry you &quot;hate&quot; this view i have, yet i am not asking you to like it.  i just wanted to rp something a little more open minded than yourself.  rest assured that the FV server will maintain this integrity you so crave.  nothing but squeaky clean high elves everywhere....<br>

You are paying 10 bucks a month and assuming that gives you the right to dictate how the game and ethics work in it.  Whereas any GM will give structures to any real role playing game as to behavior, actions, and persona of characters.<br>
<br>
You want to play a High Elf.  Guess what, in Everquest, the high elves are good, they are noble, if a bit arrogant, and upright.  The Dark Elves are evil and nasty, the Trolls are monsterous and eat people, the Iksar hate everyone and the hate is returned, etc.  You are playing Everquest, think of it being kind of like chess.  You might WANT your Knight to move like a Queen, but it doesn't, and paying 10 bucks a month doesn't change those rules no matter how you wish. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ukelson13.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kelson13</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/2/01 6:29:24 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: FV Server Complaint...</span><hr size=1> &quot;i am sorry you &quot;hate&quot; this view i have, yet i am not asking you to like it. i just wanted to rp something a little more open minded than yourself. rest assured that the FV server will maintain this integrity you so crave. nothing but squeaky clean high elves everywhere....&quot;<br>
<br>
I think you've missed my point.  Your idea is OLD.  It's been done.  It's cliche.  Every 15 year old male roleplayer on earth has done it MANY TIMES.<br>
<br>
You're not expanding your mind or trying to come up with an original character concept.  You're doing the same character everyone else tries to do when they first start out roleplaying....the self-serving evil guy who couldn't care less what anyone else thinks and is such a rebel against society.  *yawn*<br>
<br>
My point wasn't that you have to fall into someone's mold.  It's that you already are and just don't realize it.<br>
<br>
Come up with something new and you will get a lot more enjoyment out of it.<br>
<br>
Verant is trying to keep it simple.  I'm not sure I agree with their choice, but I don't see it as a problem, either.  Work with it and you'll find your characters more enjoyable.<br>

But, with that said, why does worship of Solusek Ro REQUIRE that you be &quot;EVIL&quot;.  Your choice of god has very little to do with how you will act, you arn't a cleric, you don't need to embody the absolutes of your god.  <br>
<br>
Roleplaying SHOULD be that you play your CHARACTER, not just as good or evil, but with attitudes, and with a story behind it.  WHY does your High Elf worship Solusek Ro?  It's obviously not the &quot;accepted&quot; choice of a god to worship, so why would someone worship Solusek Ro?  Is it an open worship, or something more private?  Did you pick up the worship when your parents were killed, or were you converted for other reasons.  The idea behind a roleplaying server is that there should be motivations behind what you do, and why you act as you do.  If you believe in supporting the forces of good, and in being good, then that's fine, but put more into it, duty, honor, traditions, some may feel that they do this best by simply fighting the forces of &quot;evil&quot;, but others wish to convert those others to good, and so are more accepting of evil deeds than others who serve good.  Others don't care about these things, and do what they will for their own reasons, either for learning more about magic, or to gain power simply for the sake of power.  Some may want to gain power to dominate others, and others may do it to STOP others who dominate through the use of their power.  Too many take the coward's way out, you pick a stereotype, and play the game, and never put more into it.  <br>
<br>
Everquest as well is designed to play the stereotypes.  The quests are all static, not dynamic in EQ, you can do them again and again, and if you get a quest to kill a mob, half the time, that mob won't drop what you need to complete the quest.  Guilds do not provide a structure within the game code, you don't have a rank within the guild, except Leader, Officer, or regular member.  The guildleader can't give you a quest, and even if you do the quest, you get no recognition within the context of the game.  Even if there is, you can't get experience  from doing it.  You can't play that you serve your guild, and advance in LEVELS from that.  And in the end, it limits you from being able to fully roleplay in the game.  <br>
