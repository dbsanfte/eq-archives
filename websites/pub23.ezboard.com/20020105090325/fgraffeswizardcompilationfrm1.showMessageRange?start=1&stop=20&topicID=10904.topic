I say I'm in a group now and she says Invite me then I say I'm not the leader.. Then she says your guild has been nothing but jerks. then I got mad and we argued for about 5min and she eventually got a TL from another wizard who was lfging and sitting there doing nothing and she said learn a few things from this wizard..<br>
<br>
I'm really getting sick of rude people.. Every time i'm unroleplay I get random tells for Tls.. usually I won't do them as they ask for a place to go that requires a portal fragment but if they want a bind or something and i'm not doing anything i'll do it..<br>
<br>
It seems like out of every 5 people asking for a TL.. 3 of them accept no as no.. 2 of them beg and 1 of them get hostile.. I don't like those numbers.. I want to be unroleplay so I can show off my 60 levels but when people get rude its no fun..<br>
<br>
There is no rules anywhere that says a wizard has to do all ports asked of him.. I know there is some wizards out there that do that but I'm not one of them and I don't see a problem with it.. I never charge for ports even when offered money so I suppose I'm better than some in a way.. I know how hard it is getting a port since I was once a paladin.. But I was never rude and took no as a no..<br>
<br>
Maybe my excuse was as she called it &quot;lame&quot; But its my right to chose who to port and who to not...<br>
<br>
I don't like being yelled at cause I won't I didnt start a wizard to be a taxi.. I started one to be a nuker.. I do ports when I feel like it...<br>

<br>
Excluding when I'm un-anon in EC (and that's when I want to 'port), I can think of only one time when somebody sent me a tell asking that I pick them up and 'port them somewhere. I was on LFG in Cobalt Scar at the time (kiting Wyverns), and didn't mind picking this person up, as he offered me 300pp for the trouble of 'porting to Toxx to TL him to NRo. Took 3 minutes out of my time, including medding, and was well worth it.<br>
<br>
<br>
I've never had anybody flip off at me when I refuse to 'port. I simply reply one of the following:<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, but we're in a chain pulling group and I don't have the mana to spare.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, but I'm out of portal fragments and can't xloc you to X without one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sorry, but I don't 'port when I'm in a party.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
The closest to a flipoff I ever had was a ranger who compared an xloc to asking for a SOW, and when I put him in his place, he stopped. He then asked me again when the group broke and I shouted LFG, and I was more than willing to 'port him. <p><center><a href="http://orderofantondwer.cjb.net" target=_new>

yeasterday i got one that advertised to pay for a tl to bind and since i was out of portal frags i was limited to where i could tl but i figure hey im just selling in da tunnel so its free plat <br>
so that person invites me and i sit there after joining for i kid you not,8 minutes before he askes if i will tl him and i say i will when he upholds his part of what he advertises. he gets all huffy with a big WTF (un abrieviated for my enjoyment)so i said well if you go to the airport you have to pay the cab driver right? well verent has made me a cab driver bud .so he disbands and looks for another ride only to rudely come back 10 min later (i was the only wiz in the zone  due to off peak time playing hours)and demands a port but first hands me the money so i think to myself:self i wish i had a PoH stone right now on me,but oh well let me just get this jerk out of here .   so poof he is gone then i get the rude tell afterwards telling me i should port everyone for free or i will go to hell speach<br>

<br>
I was having a bad day already and was having to sit in East Commons trying to find someone to sell me SoW potions. (AC still has not given the ring up). I get a tell asking for a translocate to bind and offering to pay.  I tell them I do not have that spell and promptly get asked what kind of wizard am I to not have this spell?  Ok.. You can insult me, my dog, and my wife, you may even insult my guild and I will not go postal.. But no one insults my ability to be a wizard.  <br>
<br>
I do a who on my new found target for aggression.  Even better he is a warrior. (background: had a warrior the week before wanting 2k for the TL spell a couple of days before.) So I reply, &quot; I am sorry but I am not able to solo the mobs that drop that spell and seem to have trouble getting into those groups. I also did not have the 2k plat to pay for a spell that does not help me at all other then trying to make 2k plat. Good luck to you!&quot; <p><b><i>"Wizards come in two types.

The best way to take care of it is if they are in a guild just send a tell to an officer or their leader. You will always get an apology back. No one likes a pissed off Sorcerer.<br>

Half of my guild carries portal fragments for me now also. Whenever we are on a big raid and I am xlocing people out at the end of the night someone will always hand me a stack of frags now. Guess they got tired of hearing me bitch about running to Sol Ro. And if you are wondering mostly the tanks have them for me. <p><B>******************</B><BR>

A firm no, no frills, and ignore if the harassment continues.  And when I say no and get a reply of &quot;why not?!?!?!&quot;, that merits and instant /ignore.  heh<br>

Last week a guildmate wizard was asked by someone to follow him around and port his twinks in Cabilis area for omg 30pp! heh<br>
<br>
and a few weeks ago myself I had an out of place lowbie in EJ ask me for a port I told him I was busy.. he said but its only a minute of your time.. I said no Im in a hurry I can port you after.. Then he goes Druid on me and says bah you wizards have it so easy just click and its done with.. Later I found out his main was a druid (makes sense) after 5min of yelling at me he gave up..<br>
<br>
Here is a good idea I thought of.. next time someone in zone gives you crap about not porting them.. Shout in the zone saying this person abused you for not porting so no wizard in the zone should port them....<br>
<br>
Or telling their guild leader works too.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulenadaynastardew.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lenadayna Stardew</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/31/01 8:17:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rude People</span><hr size=1>    I always enjoyed those arguments...<br>

Most of the time I TP people anyway (I like platinum. . .mmmm, platinum. . .), but on occasion when I have something else to do I just say &quot;Sorry, busy ATM&quot; and they go away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=10904.topic&start=21&stop=33>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=10945.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=10978.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=10904.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.threadControl?topicID=10904.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10904.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10904.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Spell Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Faction Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Quest Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Item Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm31">Fusibility Research<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm11">Velium Chill of Al'Kabor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm6">Tome of Ages Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm30">Veeshan's Peak Key</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
