All depends whether you have the inclination and patience to sit and put the effort in to building one.<br>
<br>
United Kingdoms on the Bristlebane server started with a handful of like minded individuals who have progressed over two years, kept a anti cheat policy, and have on most occasions steered clear of phat lewt whore mentality.<br>
<br>
In my two years of playing eq I have moved guilds three times, First from a small chat type guild- Bringers of fire, that is still in existance today- not really motivated towards big guild hunts; to a mediocre guild Ill tempered sea bass- lots of potential but couldnt jump to the next level. Finally about eight months ago, due to ITSB not helping lower lvl members, (although I must say in their defence- it is my opinion),<br>
I decided to join a guild in my own timeframe (GMT). United Kingdoms seemed the logical choice although they had always been a small chat type guild.<br>
<br>
I was invited by a fellow wizard who is also an officer of the guild, and one of the main reasons for joining besides the same time zone, was they -UK, were doing Plane of sky which was a considerable step up from what I thought they had been achieving.<br>
<br>
In the past eight or so months I have seen some powerful guilds on the Bristlebane server, crash IE Ring of valor over their refusal to respect a offline event calendar for the BB server. Unlucky for them - their decision to disregard the EC was exactly what a lot of guilds on the BB server were waiting for, and now the server is FCFS- first come first serve. Incidently ROV are now rebuilding their numbers and are fast becoming a &quot;contested spawn force&quot; against the main uber guild on BB - Club Fu.<br>
<br>
FCFS is now the adopted approach to most contested spawns with only naggie and vox still being run by the EC. With the breakdown of ROV, and the EC, smaller guilds and in particular GMT and Euro guilds, were able to secure contested camps, especially with the advent of Verants &quot;Play nice policy&quot;<br>
<br>
This allowed UK to attract other GMT EURO high lvl players and so in a short period of time, UK has now become arguably, the strongest GMT/EURO guild on the BB server.<br>
<br>
I take my hat off to the officers and GM for keeping the guild rational and maintaining our standards. The guild had to have a temporary freeze on membership - three months, to enable consolidation and new guild policys to be made.<br>
<br>
Obviously no guild is perfect. The advantage of a guild made up of friends- that for the better part of a year played mostly together and didnt really have any &quot;new blood&quot;; is having a very strong leadership structure that can't or won't be broken easily. The disadvantage is when the guild has to advance and open itself to new players and ideas. Without change a guild can't advance. There will always be one or two officer type ranked players that don't want change and will fight to keep their particular standing/viewpoints/philosophys safe from any transformation within the guild, usually by disqualifying- albeit behind the scenes; any new members from having any bearing on guild direction and/or policy.<br>
This has amounted to a percievable attitude in an increasing number of guild members that &quot;This is our guild - sod off&quot; type mentality, which in the early days pissed me off to no end.<br>
<br>
Now, months later I have got my own back on those twats who tried so hard to let me know that particular point <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I can now leave and join any guild on the BB server, and my guild know it. They won't lick my azz to stay, neither do I require it. Just nice to know the boot is on the other foot now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Revenge is sweet /cackle, even if it is psychological<br>
<br>
Personally I have fun in my guild advancing one step at a time. I have it in me to be part of the organizational officer structures within my guild, but there is no opourtunity for me or any other guild members to enter the officer ranks- this is because, out current structure works so well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
I have the choice at starting my own guild or maybe progessing to one of the uber phat lewt guilds for fun, but probably won't because I do enjoy the company of the many mad hatters in our guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
UK have decided to go dragonkin instead of giankin and as such our contested spawns are not too hard to defend as the other uber guilds are on different faction - /cheer Verant for a short lived and ineffective solution.I.E TOV has mobs for both dragonkin and giantkin, although Dozekal requires at least 40 peeps, but with giantkin doing a raid in the same zone, albeit different wing, the likelyhood of a zone crash is 100% - stats from past exp; and the giantkin guilds kill both uber mobs - just suicide before the faction hit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The UK guild have slowly but surely advanced with input from nearly all its members, and are now looking to take on the Vindicator. This might not be very uber to some folks, but the point is we are advancing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
My 2cp here to frustrated wizards is - an uber guild is attainable to all who care enough - find like minded trustworty peeps and do the two year stint - making sure to have policy on all the main concerns I.E fair lewt dispersion,<br>
and other inner guild politics. If you play EQ for fun then this way is by far the most rewarding. If EQ is a game to be shelved soon then tbh, you can't honestly expect to get to uber status. <br>
<br>
Yes it is difficult to lvl a wizard to 60 without a strong guild to back you, but once u are at 60 you are king/queen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
We might not be able to take lots of dmg, but I know we are of the most powerful class on the server - nerfs and all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I know this is pathetic, but what really makes my tyres squeel is when in say cazic or kaesora- every other class is forced to zone when a train to zone is called - lvl 60 warriors clerics chanters monks shaman sk paladin all solo etc except the wizard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  the others kill some of them before they have to zone - the wizard kills em all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'm sorry if this sounded a bit of a rant- I will rant in another post /cackle specifically about how Verant nerfed beta neutral faction on all servers and didnt even tell anyone/post about it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think it is a difference of perception.  To the upper wizard, it truly does seem like I am nuking more often in the Uber battle when the tanks are hacking away.  Maybe mathematically it isn't the case, but I am using far less skill fighting Vindi than I did when fighting the crypt in Sebi with a chanter and Bard in the group.<br>
<br>
To me, it isn't about controlling aggro.  Or at least depending on how you are defining &quot;control.&quot;  If you define it as aggro manipulation... i.e. Getting it, and giving it away at particular points in a fight (non-uber), then I think you have it right.  I personally find myself using more timing and spell diversity skills in a nicely put together exp group than on an uber raid.<br>
<br>
For me... and this is NOT an opinion geared for anyone else, I'm talking about ME... The uber raid is about &quot;when&quot; and &quot;which spell.&quot;  And in the case of CT, how many times am I going to suicide myself since we don't have enough melee to get the job done.  Thats it.  No snares, no stuns, rarely evac, no concussion, no &quot;rain with a DD thrown in&quot;, no taking appropraite damage at appropriate times.  I have just as much respect for those still pushing levels as I do for people like me who only raid the mongo mob.  Hell, sometimes I miss High Keep or South Karana.  I started a 2nd wizard on test just to get back to the rat race again.<br>
<br>
And Zesif, we don't all attack people below.  And those who should, should shut up and be glad you are where you are.<br>
<br>
Hell, we should be HAPPY with the lower orders.  It shows that there are still people fighting to get to the top and who aren't giving up.<br>

<br>
The original point of this thread is we keep getting raid spells when I don't see raids as a weak point of the wizard class.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem is in finding regular exp groups and we just haven't gotten any noteworthy improvements in that area.  <br>
<br>
It sure looks to me like wizards who are in uberguilds are getting what they want while Verant has the rest of us are on /ignore.  It screams favoritism and I think Verant should just be upfront for once and and explain themselves.  I know that's hard for them to do but it's something that needs to be clarified.<br>

Aye, Polgedra.  I agree with your points.  The shame is, I'm not a hardcore EQ player.  I have a busier life than some (NOT meant as an insult, folks!!), by chance, and there are just other things I need to take care of.  EQ just isn't a priority.  Still, I pay my $10 a month, and buy the upgrades, and the box doesn't have &quot;WARNING: Only for hardcore players!&quot; across the top, so, I'm expecting a little lovin in the sub-50 corner of the ring. =)<br>

Wizards have always been a difficult and somewhat underpowered class. It took me 36 days played to get from lev 1 to lev 51. We didnt have snare - we couldn't solo past lev 10. We didn't have lure spells pre 50. We didn't have a 56 rez in any zone..we rarely even had a 49 rez. You guys have it great. Hell, you guys even have true north now so you don't have to walk around in circles looking clueless while hammering the sense heading hotkey.<br>

I'm not disputing that wizards have or don't have problems. But if all your bitch is, is about the fact that uber twinked melee classes do more damage than you..then count yourself lucky. You could be playing a necro post 50..laff.<br>

If your only major complaint is twinked melee, get over it.  Verant will never (nor should they) upgrade casters *based* on twinked melee power.<br>
<br>
And as to your HUGE misconceptions regarding magicians.  Put your money where your mouth is and go try it.  You are in for a very rude awakening. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucduckman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cduckman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/4/01 10:21:48 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What The Sleeper taught me about wizards</span><hr size=1> &quot;But it does mean you can be a jackass by calling me ignorant just because I haven't been sub 50 for a while?

Yeah, I guess you do see this a lot, with the way you talk.  If you can't make points without calling people stupid and gay, then you need to grow up a bit.<br>

This isn't a specific attack on your RL status, I'm simply &quot;attacking&quot; you as a whole person because your personallity just sucks, IMHO.  You think you know everything, and regardless of whether you're right or wrong, you always give your opinions.  Maybe if you'd stop flaming people, calling everyone who has a different opinion ignorant and gay, you'd get a little respect from me.<br>

&quot;If you don't like the class (or the game for that matter) then why do you play it? If you feel melee is so much superior, then play a melee class.&quot;<br>
<br>
Quickly:<br>
-Wizzies are hard to play<br>
-Many melee folks can and do level MUCH faster than their casting counterparts.<br>
-Yet melee folks are still better in the end.<br>
<br>
This is how I do the math:<br>
When you compare the ratios of input effort to recieved abilities, melees seem to come out higher.  That's what we're (or me at least) are complaining about.<br>
<br>
I play my wiz because:<br>
1.) I've invested too much time into him to start over.  I, unlike many folks here, am not as hardcore of a player.  I don't think that means I shouldn't have fun, though.  I pay my $10/mo the same as everyone else.<br>
<br>
2.) I've always played wizards. I like the casting and nuking and utility spells.<br>
<br>
3.) Overall, I love playing a wizard.  It's a fun experience.  This doesn't mean, however, that taking other classes into context, or looking at other issues, I won't have complaints.<br>
<br>
Hope that helped....<br>

I can understand that.  As I said in another reply (maybe in another thread), I think you should defend yourself from being called &quot;stupid&quot; simply because you're post-50.  I don't think that's what many of the folks here are saying though.  Read some of my other replies.  I think most of us are saying:<br>

2.) Any post-50 who thinks we need to STFU can kiss our collective ass. =)  Now unless you're telling sub-50's to STFU, you don't fall in here, and I don't think most of the folks here will have a problem wit ye.<br>
<br>
Just being post-50 doesn't make you stupid.  =)  It'd be moronic to insinuate that.<br>

Matter of opinion.  Just because someone has played 1-50 doesn't mean they're an expert and know when improvements should be made.<br>
<br>
&quot;The wizards you are trash-talking are the ones who got them where they are.&quot;<br>
The wizards I am trash talking, same with many other folks here, are the ones who are telling us to STFU.  We pay cash, we have a voice, and we'll give our opinions.  Telling us we know jack sh*t isn't going to help anything.<br>
<br>
&quot;But they still occasionally throw in some sub-50 enhancements.&quot;<br>
Not recently.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do you know how sweet it would have been for us wizards to have invis vs undead back then? Wanna take a guess at how difficult Ice Comet used to be?&quot;<br>
I'm sorry.  I'm sure it was difficult.  Just because you walked 7 miles through the snow a while back doesn't mean that I can't ride the bus when everyone else is.  I pay my education tax.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Wake up and go play.&quot;<br>
If you're telling me to STFU because you had it harder and don't think wizzies need to be upgraded, you wake up and go play a wiz from 1-50 again. =)  And if you don't agree with me after that, then feel free to post it here.  Not everyone will always agree.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;If your only major complaint is twinked melee, get over it.&quot;<br>
Nae.  Although twinked melees are an issue, it seems that non-twinked players of many other classes have it much easier.  I could (and would love to) accept that if I felt that wizzies got a good payoff in ability later in the game, compared to other classes.  At least to a degree.  I don't want 50 levels of  pure hell, I doubt I get that high. =)  From what I've heard, I haven't seen those benefits anyway.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot; And as to your HUGE misconceptions regarding magicians. Put your money where your mouth is and go try it. You are in for a very rude awakening.&quot;<br>
Sorry if I hit a nerve.  The mage friends I have do more damage than myself in fights.  And by taking a look at the spell list, you can see plenty of examples where mages are very much par with wizzies.  Not every spell, not all the time.  Hell, some levels are the complete oposite of what I just said.  I'm not THAT stupid.  =)  I'm saying that from the spell lists I've read, and the mages I play with (I know you'll ask - they're post 30), I've generally been less effective than mages in general.  They send a pet, and then we both proceed to nuke for very compareable damage.<br>

<br>
Quickly about the magician thing.  I was mainly referring to soloing.  When you partner a wiz and a mage (in the earlier levels) you get a very good combination.  The mages pet can tank because with the combined nukes, the mobs die faster than the pet.  In other situations, the mage has to focus on other things like healing and buffing his pet.  Cause if his pet dies, the mage dies.. period.  I'd recommend re-examining the magician spell line with an eye on efficiency and limitations.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I am genuinely interested in what kind of enhancements you are looking for.  Please elaborate.  While you current lower level wizards *do* have it easier than I did in terms of spells and functionality, twinking is a concern that effects groupability in those lower levels.  That is something that does have to just be dealt with.  And what have high level wizards recieved &quot;recently&quot; besides banes?<br>
<br>
Seriously, if there is a problem with wizards in the lower level game, I would be interested in hearing some specifics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samadhi BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Forum Sorcerer</font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/4/01 11:02:53 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What The Sleeper taught me about wizards</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I can understand that.

Let me state this right off:<br>
<br>
Disagreeing with your ideas and debating them with you does not mean:<br>
<br>
1. I'm mocking you<br>
2. I'm telling you to STFU<br>
3. I believe you're a bad person.<br>
<br>
I agree with a lot of things posted on Graffe's Boards, I also disagree with a lot of them, and will debate those I disagree with. I also dislike people trying to tell me that my opinions are invalid becasue I'm level 60 and in a guild that does a lot of things. They do this because they don't like my views. Natan Magus is level 60, and claims he is in an uber guild (I'm not sure, I don't know any guilds from Mith marr except Afterlife). He agrees with most of the ideas presented by the people claiming my views are distorted, and therefore he is not brought up when people talk about how being level 60 in a good guild distorts your opinions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucduckman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cduckman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/4/01 11:22:05 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What The Sleeper taught me about wizards</span><hr size=1> &quot;Quickly about the magician thing. I was mainly referring to soloing.&quot;<br>
If you want to talk about soloing at lower levels, take a 25 wiz, and take a 25 mage, and try to solo.  The wiz can do it if his root holds, but has a lot of downtime.  The mage can solo just fine.  However, this is not my point.<br>
<br>
&quot;Quickly about the magician thing. I was mainly referring to soloing.&quot;<br>
Definatly.  2 nukers + pet is a good combination.<br>
<br>
&quot;In other situations, the mage has to focus on other things like healing and buffing his pet.&quot;<br>
I've never seen the mages I hunt with spend a ton of time healing and buffing their pet.  Maybe it's just the luck of the draw.  Maybe not. /shrug  I see them cast buffs before fights.  I can see a little bit of downtime there.  But the mana cost to summon a pet + the mana cost to keep him buffed seems insignificant compared to how much damage and usefulness (tanking, rooting, stunning, etc) a pet can offer.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Cause if his pet dies, the mage dies.. period.&quot;<br>
Soloing, almost always.  In groups, generally not, in my experience.  That depends greatly on groups though, so don't think I'm saying mages don't die in groups.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I'd recommend re-examining the magician spell line with an eye on efficiency and limitations.&quot;<br>
I'll agree, wizzies are more efficient.  I just don't see a huge gap.  That I wouldn't know for myself, I've never leveled a mage even to 20.  I get all of this from the folks I know in RL who play mages. =)<br>
<br>
Generally, I just see mages in groups doing more damage than I do, or at the least, par.  I'm simply stating that I think since mages have that extra security blanket of a tank, they shouldn't deal as much damage as wizzies.<br>
<br>
Which leads me to your second point.  I don't know if mages should have their damages nerfed.  I don't think so.  I personally think wizzies need to get some kind of general focus item to make us stronger.  Familiars and the new focus items might be solving that, so you might hear me shut up really soon on mage vs. wizard issues. =)<br>
<br>
I find that wizzies are very fun group players.  Depending on the group, I stand up, nuke a couple times, and call it good. =)  /gems is a close friends, much the same as the TV remote.  That's why I still play wizzies.<br>
<br>
The problem is, classes like mages do just as much if not more (often more) damage than I do in groups.  Others are more useful, such as warriors.  That's fine, I'm not going to pull out the book on class balancing here.  I'll just say, generally, I think I put in too much and get out too little.  Now you can solve that problem by giving us tons of really neat post-50 stuff, but that only solves it for those who hit post-50.  I honestly doubt I will, and I think it's fair to say I need a couple cookies down here.  I pay my $10 a month. =)<br>
<br>
The wizard problem hasn't changed much.  We're still much the same as we used to be, from what I understand.  The problem is that many other classes, such as melees, are getting a lot of additions that make them notably superior to wizards.  And the general class balancing issue on top of that (IE: mages, necros, druids, etc.).<br>
<br>
That's how I see it.  I know some agree.  I know some disagree.  I just don't see the harm in asking for some improvements sub-50.  Many other classes are getting them, we haven't gotten any in a long time (or so it seems to me), and the fact is that most paying customers won't ever hit post-50.  It's Verant's game.  If they want wizzies to rule post-50 and have hell before 50, that's their call.  As a paying customer, I disagree, and I'm simply voicing my stupid opinion. =)<br>

A wizard has much more in the way of security blankets.  Root, Snare, Shadow Step line, Stuns.  These are all very very nice tools to &quot;get away&quot;.  Magicians don't fare so well.  Wizards have more utility than a magician, and you state that they are about on par with us for damage.  What then, does a magician have?  Damage shields?<br>
<br>
Wizards can get a group out of tight situations, whether its with an evac, or with a mana-dump.  Magicians do not share that luxury... nor do most other classes.<br>

You also state wizards have hell before 50.  Where do you get this conclusion from?  What are some specific examples of problems we face sub-50 that make it so hard for us?  Nothing has really changed sub-50.  They sure have improved our soloing abilities with one genius stroke.  With root not cancelling snare.  And that also helps in any group that rooting and snaring are used.  (which is pretty often)<br>

You want some &quot;cookies&quot; but give no examples of where they are needed or what problems need resolving.  Because I don't see any problems sub-50 and I am genuinely curious as to what you want done to the class.<br>
