<br>
ANY melee has an advantage over a wizard<br>
<br>
sk- unkillable by wizard<br>
pally-unkillable <br>
rogue-hard as hell<br>
monk-hard as hell<br>
warrior-nearly impossible<br>
ranger- hard as hell<br>
<br>
im talking about 55+ battling in a PVP server not duels<br>
i am talking about hardcore pvpers not people who can be rooted and snared like n00bs and people with full resist gear and such<br>
so i dont really want n00b remarks about how soandso kill a pally in a duel once and such it really peeves me off<br>
<br>
example:<br>
I see melee I target and open up with lure<br>
lure hits does normal damage<br>
<br>
follow up with draught does 80 points of damage or so<br>
<br>
melee reacts clicks his golem wand twice most of my buffs are gone so i have jboots/sow lev left since they on bottom<br>
<br>
if lev still up melee with wand or pumice it off so im buff less on the ground <br>
<br>
im melleed 1/2 my life is gone when a primal pally doubles me for 214 or tantors tusk hits or rogue Double BS me, or ranger pumpels me( since DS potion debufed i got nada)<br>
<br>
i run around like dork<br>
<br>
shadowstep takes me 2 feet down hill yonder takes me a bit far melee catches up melees me again and im dead<br>
<br>
maybe i'll get 4 or 5 nukes w/ faster recast delay temp flux at most get him to 75% health <br>
<br>
and even IF i got him low all he has to do and run and regen hp with fungi or sk just taps me or pally heals or monk mends <br>
or ranger uses bow n arrow dis and kils me<br>
<br>
Wizards are broken im afraid to say<br>
<br>
I can kill other wizards, mages, some druids, and anyone w/o resists<br>
<br>
but thats about it<br>

<br>
You just need to take extreme care to NOT let them get close enough to hit you, this means not trying to channel thru attacks if they see you casting halfway thru, this means duck, and yonder/shadowstep when they spot you.<br>
<br>
The only thing that really pissed me off about the 62.5% damage in pvp (yes, it's actaully 62.5%) is that heals still heal full.<br>
<br>
so on a druid with good resists where only lure would work, i can hit him for 515 in pvp, for 320 mana with lure of ice.<br>
<br>
but the druid can negate that with 2 chloroblasts in nearly the same time, for less mana =x making a druid who simply heals himself, totally unkillable.<br>
chloroblast is... 385 hp's for 175 mana i believe? something close. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/11/02 7:41:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: melee vs caster ..and the 66% cap of pvp</span><hr size=1> Hello, I'm a 56 rogue on RZ with epic, thurgadin quest armor, decent resist gear that I do wear in pvp and a fair amount of pvp experience I think I should just clarify a few things for you.<br>
<br>
Melees HUGE hp.  Not all of us have like 3k hp in resist gear at 56 I have 1700.  This means even a lowbie nuke like IC if it hit for full could do most of my hp if the 66% dmg nerf was removed.  This is not even going into how much this change would hurt casters with their lower hp.<br>
<br>
Melee dmg.  Melee dmg distribution is NOTHING like spell dmg. If you look at the dmg done by lures in pvp you will see a steady dmg output that is nearly always near max.  If you look at melee dmg on the other hand its very inconsistant from moment to moment and the average dmg is MUCH lower than max.  In other words people might say wow he backstabbed for 500! then ignore the fact that the bs before that missed and the 2 before that did minimum dmg.<br>
<br>
Getting nukes off in pvp. Consider these strategies...<br>
<br>
You can levitate and nuke from from overhead be sure to bury it deep in your buff stack.<br>
<br>
You can rune yourself once the rune is done with you can shadowstep and recast and come back.  This is expensive mannawise until you get your epic though but hey how much of your manna do you really need to kill someone with 1700hp?  You may die to a double backstaab but your not gonna run oom.<br>
<br>
You can &quot;step into the nuke&quot; as a friend of mine put it.  Channeling is a simple loc comparison.  The game compares the loc you started at and the one the spell ended at. Melee dmg will move you.  The further you move the harder it is to pass the channeling check.  Its possible to move back to negate the movement caused by the hits.<br>
<br>
You can cast through walls.  Sure this is cheap but its there.<br>
<br>
You can use melee range to your advantage melees can't hit a moving target so you can run around as long as you need to avoid dmg.  This is about 2x as effective if you zig zag rather than move in a straight line.  as my lowbie sk I've had casters 30% snared (clinging darkness) and had them avoid a fair bit of melee dmg by jerky movements.  They still died <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but this does tend to work better when your NOT snared.<br>
<br>
You can shadowstep and yonder to cast.<br>
<br>
Last and best you can take the initiative.  You like rogues are a pure offense class. So move in and nuke their ass hard before they even know your comming and see what kind of advantage that gives you.  Hell they might not even have the right resist gear up considering the best ac hp int wis manna isn't usually the best resist stuff.<br>
<br>
Now on the subject of nerfing melee dmg to 66% are you crazy? As a rogue with great offensive skills its still hard to kill wizards with enough pr to resist poison.  Outdoors its not gonna happen unless they are dumb they will yonder away before death.  Indoors they still have the option of running for zone in many places and since I can't hit a moving target more than once in a blue moon I can't stop em very easily.  Add to that the fact that they can channel gate very consistantly through fast melee dmg.  If they were to take you up on your suggestion my character would be a joke and deleted not long after with a lot of other rogues.<br>
<br>
The fact that ANYONE could suggest not only nerfing melee dmg or removing the spell dmg nerf but both at once is a shocking thing for me.  My suggestion.  Ask Verant for a refund for the time you've wasted you don't belong on a pvp server if you suck that much.  Do you need every other player to be reduced to impotency while your buffed to a stupid lvl of power to make up for your lack of skill? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umakyz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Makyz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/19/02 4:40:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: melee vs caster ..and the 66% cap of pvp</span><hr size=1> melees are far overpowered in the pvp situation Aerimus.<br>

GOLEM WANDS!!!<br>
95% garuntees caster killer<br>

<br>
2-3 clicks and then the caster yonders, harmshields, DAs, Shadowsteps and rebuffs and your out a lot of plat.  How long can you keep burning plat that way.  For me even though I know the use of em this is still something I only use occasionally and as far as hp I've been fighting a 60 necro with roughly 1.6k hp unbuffed lately.  Has almost as much hp as I do in pvp gear, thx info.&quot;<br>
<br>
What about the fact that every lvl 60 caster I've fought has channeled through epic dmg output around 100% of the time WITH me hitting them for near the spells full duration?  What about the fact that all you have to do is run in a circle to avoid me hitting you but you can nuke me from a mile away through a wall and around 2 corners.<br>
<br>
What about the fact that necros after 54 can suck hp at about 63dps in pvp with no hope of interuption.  Or channel vex through 10 melee hits and run around for a minute while most of their hp come back.  How about the fact that without golem wand all a necro has to do is land even 1 dot and the fight is over because the rogue with 0 channeling skill can't dispell it.<br>
<br>
What about the fact that a caster has buffs that if they remain up give the caster 100% chance of victory vs me that I cannot remove without golem wands if they spam 2 insta cast items.<br>
<br>
What about the fact that its possible to run in a circle while your pet chews on a melee because we can't hit a moving target.<br>
<br>
Without the 66% dmg nerf on most pvp spells (drood swarm dots seem to do 100%) being a rogue on rallos zek not only wouldn't be fun it would be an exercise in futility.<br>
<br>
Besides this you are so stuck on the caster vs melee issue that you don't understand how much removing the dmg nerf would hurt other casters as well.  Wizards would basicly utterly destroy all other caster classes with little effort way too fast.<br>
<br>
See my post regarding a suggestion for more properly tuning spell dmg in pvp please.<br>
<br>
One last note...Harmtouch is a spell.  If you got rid of the dmg nerf it would be hitting for 1500 in pvp at 60 enjoy.<br>

PREACH ON BROTHER!<br>
<br>
I nearly fell out of my chair laughing at this thread....<br>
<br>
45 Warrior, 20 Shaman, 16 Wizard on RZ.<br>
<br>
To the individual who stated one should wear a fungi tunic through a fight... Are you insane? That sucker gets bagged, like RIGHT NOW. Trust me, you may drop me, but you ARE NOT going to loot a 4-5k tunic off of me.<br>
<br>
Wearing it at all is a problem that has to be very carefully considered - because if you put it on, that means you are low on hit points, and THAT means you a nice, juicy target.<br>
<br>
Casting through walls is a problem, but so is casting from UP a wall. Wizzy climbs up a wall (like in Everfrost), and can nuke away - meanwhile our melee friend is slobbering away trying to climb up it (because he can't seem to aim a bow UP - for some god-forsaken reason only Verant understands...).<br>
<br>
The further point that my esteemed Rallos Zek colleague has brought up that is getting no consideration from the other posters is that without the nerf casters would pull one nuke and drop another caster instantly.<br>
<br>
Nerfing melee damage by 66%??? It already is. The moving target disaster effectively does that (probably nerfs it for more, if ya ask me). Your nerf, plus the nerf that already is in there because of screwed up moving target and target too high/low messages from a bow means we will be doing negative damage. <br>
<br>
If you nerf melee damage, we warriors should then be provided with a discipline at level one called Self-Disembowelment. You type /disc self and kill yourself immediatly - still allowing your antagonist to loot... it just gets you to the corpse run quicker.<br>
<br>
ANY wizard that gets killed by a melee below lvl 50 is too stupid to play the game and should retire to a blue server immediatly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27>PVP Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
