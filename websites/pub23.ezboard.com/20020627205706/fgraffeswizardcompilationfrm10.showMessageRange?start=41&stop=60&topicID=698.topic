Ah huh, yeah...<br>
Ok so who can go round most zones invis WITH their defences up? Sure isnt a mage.<br>
Who can do Crowd Control?<br>
Sure isn't a mage.<br>
Who has Skin spells?<br>
Sure isn't a mage.<br>
Who has snare/root/stun?<br>
Sure isn't a mage. Sure the pets can do the last two things but it is not *reliable*, and not controlled by you.<br>
<br>
Dont' start that again, mages sacrificed nearly EVERY defence for offence.<br>
Jibober is good on one target, as long as he's alive, and *you can have him up*.<br>
In tight indoors situations, then perhaps a mage can have the advantage, or at least time to gate bought by the pet. But a skilled wiz, if theres room indoors can snare/root mobs.<br>
Soloing indoors mage probably has the advantage, travelling through though the wiz perhaps is safer.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If mages and wizards are both fast burn classes, and mages do more long-term, I don't really see much point to adding a wizard to a group. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Sure, there is a point to adding a wizard to the group.  Teleport, evac, snare, stuns, roots.  There's more to the game than damage, my friend.  Even so, don't foget that I stated clearly that I don't have a problem with wizards doing as much damage over a long period of time as a magician.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> First off, the very point of fast burn, has been pretty much broken down. As Grim mentioned, you need 4-5 casts to even see a difference in fast casting. If you chain-nuke like that, 1 of 2 things (or both things) will likely happen. You will get aggro and get pounded on, and/or you will be OOM really quick.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Nukes alone, wizards will do faster damage than a magician.  Aggro is a concern, however, at this level root and snare can prevent aggro from being a problem(for either class, wizard or magician).  Also, it does not take 4-5 casts to make a difference.  There is a difference <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> every single cast</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  It just takes 4-5 casts for the difference to become obvious enough for just about anyone to be able to see.  However, the point is moot, because if you're trying to compare fast damage between wizards and mages you're always going to have trouble because, as I stated, both classes excel at fast damage.  <br>
<br>
As for fast damage being worthless, that hasn't been proved true by any stretch of the imagination.  Convincing examples have been shown in specific high level situations, but not at all levels.  Situations where the maximum attainable spell DPS is around 150-175(and that's stretching it a bit) and the max melee dps is 80-120 or so.  At level 34 melee dps is probably between 10 and 15, while spell dps can easily get into the 40s and 50s.  Nukers can do 3 to 4 times as much damage as a melee over a short period of time at this lower level.<br>
<br>
The value of fast damage is debatable, as enchanter mez usually minimizes the need for it, however fast damage can make a lot of difficult situations easy, particularly if you're spending your 30s in Guk rather than Overthere.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Wizards are a nuking classs, it is all we have to do damage with. If we are not, and I actually believe this, the most damaging class in the game, then thier really is little argument for taking us over another class that does MORE damage but also has defensive skills. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Magicians do not have many defensive skills either.  From a magician point of view, wizards have more useful defensive abilities, such as snare, root, and the skin spells.  From a wizard point of view, pets are better defense than any of those things.<br>
<br>
My view is that the defensive abilities balance out.  If, indeed, pets are more useful for defense, they have their own drawbacks and it's really hard to make a direct comparison.  Until one side shows convincing evidence one way or the other, I'll continue to believe that niether class has a significant advantage overall when it comes to secondary abilities.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Mages have a pet. Warriors, rogues, rangers and monks all have more AC and skills, if needed, to avoid aggro. More than any other offensice class, the wizard totally and completely sacrifices defense. The reward for that should be terrifying, and unparralled. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Wizards have skins, snare, root, concussion, some stuns, and group evacuates as defensive abilities.  Magicians have none of those.  Instead, they have a pet.  Do not try to compare them unless you really feel you are capable of an unbiased comparison and have data to back it up.  Since I do not admit the ability to compare them fully, I will instead rule them out completely and consider them balanced until someone proves otherwise.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> But [the reward for defensive sacrifice] isnt [unparallelled], furthermore there are many who apparently think it should be. If we are to keep finishing somewhere in the middle of the pack of damage dealers, there is simply no argument for this class to exist, except as TLers.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I have quite a few problems with this statement.<br>
<br>
First, I have already disagreed that wizards sacrifice enough defense so as to be useless beyond nukes, at least when compared to magicians, so the foundation for this statement is weak in my eyes.<br>
<br>
Second, you claim to finish in the middle of the pack of damage dealers.  This vague statement is easily proved false.  All one would need is a log of a Luclin boss encounter.  In most any given fight at most levels, a wizard stands a very good chance of being the highest damage dealer, should he choose to be.  It is not until you get into a steady fighting situation where the only object is to kill as many mobs over a long period of time that wizard <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> damage</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> finishes in the middle of the pack, and even in those situations sometimes an ability like snare is more valuable than damage.<br>
<br>
Finally, a wizard is more than just single target nukes and translocates.  Aside from the aforementioned snare ability, which, though acquired somewhat late in the life of a wizard(29), is a very valuable ability, wizards have several different categories of AE spells.  Also, there are really two nuking classes in the game that are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pet dependant.  Wizards and Druids.  Since we are comparing wizards and mages, we must realize that Magicians are pet dependant.  If a magician cannot use his pet, then it will take a whole lot of damage shields to catch up to wizards.  For many people, the responsibility of a pet is not something they want to deal with.  If you're looking for a reason to have both wizards and magicians in the game, there is your answer.  Not everyone wants to be dependant on a pet, and not everyone wants to deal with the hassle of controlling one.  <br>
<br>
If long term damage really mattered as much as you claim, that is that the wizard class is useless because magicians are in the game, then why do wizards outnumber magicians?  <br>
<br>
Rhetorical question.  Just think about it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fast-burn, as a concept, is situational and certainly not needed in a group. If you plan to take away even that, then you remove the final, though creaky, argument for even having a wizard around.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'm talking about <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>ONE</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> class here, and that is magicians.  The ability to do fast damage is something that these two classes share.  One out of fourteen other classes that can equal your fast burn damage output doesn't invalidate wizards.<br>
<br>
When discussing balance, one must be very careful not to let ones personal bias and perspective cloud things to the point that by &quot;I want balance&quot; one really means &quot;I want to be the most powerful.&quot;  Fynal, you basically downplayed several wizard strengths and unique aspects of the class, and used a blanket comparison against all classes when, in fact, I was only talking about magicians.

<br>
Re-reading your post and re-reading mine I see your part of your point. You are correct about snares and evacs (especially the recent addition) and thier utility in the group. I can also concede that it is very hard to make a concrete comparison about who has greater defensive skill.<br>
<br>
I still disagree about the fast damage thing. I think it's very situational, and quite frankly, I cant remember the last time I had to burn down a mob. As you mentioned there's usually someone CCing in the group, and if it gets beyond thier capabilities I am likely to evac--not burn them down.<br>
<br>
I am highlighting this because, this is what people say the wizard class is about--fast damage. That is the big difference between us and other damage dealers, allegedly. But aggro pretty much negates this as possible. Root and snare (especiallly root) are very unreliable means of controlling aggro should the situation arise that you need to.<br>
<br>
The situation you listed for damage is a raid encounter, I am assuming. Wizards certainly excel here. Unfortunately, there are many of us who still spend much of our time xping. When I am fighting in seb, karnors, or chardok, I am always toward the back when it comes to dealing damage over a long session.<br>
<br>
As for the diversity of spells you list, I use almost none of them in xping situations or on raids. Up to 52, I almost never used a rain a spell, even on single targets. Pillars and columns, I only used when soloing. PBAOEs, I almost never used. Half our arsenal is made up of AOEs, which have little relevance to the game for much of our career.<br>
<br>
For us, it always comes back to direct damage. This is our staple, our bread and butter. You take direct damage from a wizard, and you have a very gimped class. And yet for so much of our career, our DDs are well rivaled by other classes in the game. That is depressing. The minor advantages in mana and speed, just dont cut it. They arent enough to make us the true specialists we are supposed to be.<br>
<br>
Yeah, I get your point about over-exxagerating and downplaying. It was a bit of an emotional reaction to a statemtent about the most important things we have to offer. <br>

Personally I think that ALL casters need at least a +10% increase in nuke power. <br>
<br>
Wizzies +40% (mana ratios and damage output)  think thats nuts consider high end damage out put from melee. Whether by focus items or spell adjustments...  *shrug*<br>
A spell that casues non-energy damage, resists is by AC/stamina/dodge, causes an explosion centered on the mob, the non-magical explosion, crushing damage, is less efficient but hits *anything* bar incoporeal mobs or htose immune to blunt trauma.<br>
<br>
mages need our pets made non-kos, +1-4 levels for post 50 pets, damage for post 50 pets upped by +1-8 hp, fire pets given standard melee damage and lvl 30ish wiz spells, antifearless spell made undispellable, a magic resistant pet (we have FR, CR, DR, PR pets but not magic, which is a pest), summon companion made 1 sec cast, pet hold skill made a lvl 51 skill (currently lvl 59 class skill 6 points which SUCKS), and a nuke that summons a projectile damage is resisted by AC/dodge.<br>

<br>
To Fynalwiz,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I still disagree about the fast damage thing.

In a situation of your choosing, you can exceed the damage output of any melee.  In a lower level group, the important situation might be the Ghoul Scribe(not a ton of hp.. Quickly!  Kill that motherfucker before he charms someone!).  The key point is that once a battle starts, you'll either win or you'll lose.  If the outcome is not certian, then a wizard can choose to be the most valuable damage dealer there.  Losing is basically the worst thing that can happen to any group.  Evacuating is often sort of a get out of jail free card..  you still go to jail, you've still wasted a turn, you don't collect $200, but you don't have to wait three turns to get going again again.  In any given fight, the wizard can choose to minimize the chance of losing by outdamaging everyone.  <br>
<br>
Also, you don't have to be high level to raid.  You don't have to waste 50 levels playing a boring game so that you can get to the good stuff.  You also don't have to wait for an enchanter to do anything.<br>
<br>
Tracker tells the group, 'Hey, Thistle Underbrush on track, cons yellow.. wan't me to pull him?'<br>
<br>
A_Friend29 tells you, 'Hey Fynal, I'm looking for some people to help me kill these three necros in rathe mountians for a quest want to help?'<br>
<br>
A_Friend34 tells you, 'We got a hunting party here headed to Dalnir for some fun and loots, we could use a nuker for those nasty casters, you want to come?'<br>
<br>
A_Friend42 tells you, 'The Corrupted Earthworm is up!  Can you come help me take him out?'<br>
<br>
Someone53 tells the guild, 'Anyone not busy want to come help me kill Cazel?'<br>
<br>
A_Friend60 tells you, 'Want to come kill Dragons in West Wastes?'<br>
<br>
I don't know about you, but xp groups came and went.  The fun and memorable times were the dungeon crawls, killing tough mobs for friends(or just because they were there)..  Basically any time when it wasn't all about making your xp bar go up.  Those are the situations where a wizards ability to turn on the heat(or put the mob on ice, as the case may be), is very valuable.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The situation you listed for damage is a raid encounter, I am assuming. Wizards certainly excel here.

I do not mean, necessarily, a stereotypical &quot;raid&quot; such as you would find in a normal raiding guild.<br>
<br>
But for XP groups, yes, it has been shown that wizards are lacking a bit in overall damage contribution in a medium uptime experience group.  I have not disputed this, nor have I tried to say that it should be this way.  I did say that, at one point in the life of the game, it perhaps made sense that wizards should sacrifice long term damage in order to be valuable quick damage and have valuable utility.  However, I think that way of thinking is obselete.<br>
<br>
Focus items are the first step in addressing this, though I think they are not a good solution.  In fact, I think they muck things up horribly in all kinds of ways, particularly because they are summoned by magicians.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I am highlighting this because, this is what people say the wizard class is about--fast damage. That is the big difference between us and other damage dealers, allegedly. But aggro pretty much negates this as possible. Root and snare (especiallly root) are very unreliable means of controlling aggro should the situation arise that you need to.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Aggro is a really hard thing to discuss.  We don't know for sure one way or the other whether wizard spells cause as much aggro as magician spells for the damage they do.  I can tell you one thing, though, and that is that for much of the time between levels 34 and 44 I used Blaze, not Cinder Bolt, because I frequently had trouble controlling my aggro with Cinder Bolt.  If indeed wizards have a pre-concussion aggro advantage, then that is another advantage that has not yet been given enough credit.  <br>
<br>
Also, gaining aggro is not necessarily the end of the world.  Many melees would like you to think so, after having really bad wizards overnuke in dangerous ways, but if the mob dies one or two seconds after it aggroes on you and the resulting ping pong was not significant, then no harm has really been done, especially if you happen to be using a skin spell.  Work on your AC and HP!  Ignore all those wizards telling you int is all that matters.  For level 30ish mobs in Lower Guk, three nukes is often enough to kill something outright, one or two nukes can make a huge difference.<br>
<br>
Also, aggro is not always an issue in situations where fast damage is desired.  My guild recently took down Derakor the Vindicator for the second time, and this time I managed to not die instantly.  His melee damage output is already insane, and it's 10x worse when he enrages and he kills melees that have lagged.  The critical time is the last few seconds when he goes nuts.  The first 5 minutes of fighting is just wearing him down, so long as clerics have enough mana and concentration, that part of it can go on indefinitely.  But in the last 30 seconds, when he's at 5% life, enraged, starting to kill unlucky people, a cleric dies, and the whole thing is about to go to shit a nuker needs to go full burn.  Aggro won't be a problem unless the main tank goes down, and even then there should be a bunch of meleers next in line to get pummeled to give you some time to nuke.  Looking at my log, I did 4530 damage in nukes during the last 37 seconds.  That's 122 damage per second from a level 58 magician(pet died to enrage).  My dps for the fight overall was probably between 30 and 40, depending on how well my pet did, as I dropped a few rods and actually cothed in a latecomer mid-fight, and I was certianly nowhere near our wizard who claimed to have done 20k(56.5dps overall) before getting squished.  But I gladly traded my long term damage contribution in order to keep the final and critical 30 seconds from being a failure.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sure, 75% of the time fast damage may not be all that great, but in my opinion, more often than not that last 25% is the whole reason I play the game in the first place.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> As for the diversity of spells you list, I use almost none of them in xping situations or on raids. Up to 52, I almost never used a rain a spell, even on single targets. Pillars and columns, I only used when soloing. PBAOEs, I almost never used. Half our arsenal is made up of AOEs, which have little relevance to the game for much of our career.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'm afraid that this isn't truely a fault of the class, rather with the way you played the game.  While I will admit that pre-50 rain spells are crap, as are Al'Kabor AE spells, a creative wizard should be able to find uses for AEs.  One time a bunch of friends were assembling for a raid in Chardok, and we were in front of the castle(in chardok, not burning woods).  We were just chillin, killin as a normal xp group when the wizard and I noticed that we had zero enchanters, three tanks, two nukers, and a druid.  We were like... AE!!  Tanks took a second to taunt adds, I kept up damage shields, and the wizard and I mixed single target nukes with AEs.  He primarily used his Pillars, while I used the PBAE scintillation.  It was fun as hell and more effecient than simple /assist nuking.<br>
<br>
Seriously, I suggest that you mem an AE or two in a group without an enchanter.  Keep in mind that the spells cause extra aggro, but look for opportunities to make use of the AEs.  Say one mob is getting really low on health and there are two in camp.  Drop a Pillar of Frost on them, the first one for sure won't aggro, and if the tank spent a little time taunting there's a good chance the second one won't either, but if it does aggro, the first mob is almost dead and you should be able to hold the mob until the first mob dies.  Obviously having your epic would help a great deal, but it's not necessary.  If you hit two mobs for full with a pillar, that's a mana effeciency of about 4.9, draught is only 3.2 before focus.<br>
<br>
Clever use of AE spells is fun!  It's not too late to experiment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> For us, it always comes back to direct damage. This is our staple, our bread and butter.

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> For us, it always comes back to direct damage.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I agree.  Single target direct damage is the simplest and by far the most useful way for any caster do deal damage.  Wizards are all about damage dealing.  2+2 = 4.  I understand <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You take direct damage from a wizard, and you have a very gimped class.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Again, I'll agree.  AEs and ports alone wouldn't cut it.  Take nukes from a cleric, you'd still have a very useful class.  Take nukes from an Enchanter, and you'd still have a very useful class.  Take nukes from a Druid, well.. ok if you took nukes from druids then they would be the worst class in the game at high levels.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> And yet for so much of our career, our DDs are well rivaled by other classes in the game.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Like Druids, for example?  Well, consider the typical reasons given by wizards as arguments against druids getting nukes:<br>
<br>
1.  Druids buff<br>
2.  Druids Heal<br>
3.  Druids sow<br>
4.  Druids port/evac*<br>
5.  Druids get to wear better armor<br>
6.  Druids get root*<br>
7.  Druids snare**<br>
8.  Druids DoT<br>
<br>
* Wizards port and root too, so these cancel out as a reason for druids not to have nukes.<br>
**  Wizards snare too, and even though the druid version is better, wizards don't seem to feel they should have nukes penalized for snaring, so druids shouldn't either<br>
<br>
That leaves us with:<br>
<br>
1.  Druids buff<br>
2.  Druids Heal<br>
3.  Druids sow<br>
5.  Druids get to wear better armor<br>
8.  Druids DoT<br>
<br>
1)  In many situations, #1 is marginalized by the presense of another class.  HP/AC is done better by a cleric until 50+, at which point clerics are still better but druids have hp or mana regen as alternatives.  HP buffs also do nothing to help an experience group get more experience, unless that group has a cleric, in which case the druid buff will be useless.  Strength is done better by a shaman and certianly not a critical buff.  Resist buffs are useless against mobs that don't cast spells.  Damage shields are great, but only one group member needs cast damage shields, and a magician is generally a better choice in that regard.  <br>
<br>
3) Movement spells are also not as special at high levels.  Either you are indoors, or people have jboots or runspeed.  In any case, the presence of one character with a movement spell is usually more than adequete.  Having access to SoW is very convenient, but I'd be hard pressed to take nukes away from someone because they had the ability to cast sow, at least.. as levels increase.  At low levels I would agree to a certian amount of sacrifice for this ability.<br>
<br>
5)  Armor...  Well, that druids can wear &quot;better&quot; armor is subjective.  They can get better AC gear, that is fairly certian, so in that respect druids should perhaps have some sort of penalty.  Regardless of the armor worn, however, druids are not much better at self defense than wizards.  Certianly not enough to toss out nukes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Druid DoTs.  Well, I would mark dots as a situational tool.  A DoT is really just like a nuke in every way except that you have to wait for it to deal it's damage, and perhaps dots are less aggro.  DoTs also tend to have a better mana effeciency than nukes, if allowed to reach their full potential.  If it were me, I would put Damage over Time spells in a category similar to Pillars, Rains, and other situational damage spells.  Also, druid DoTs really are not that good.  If you look at Winged Death, the best druid DoT in the game other than the epic, the mana ratio is 3.6, and if manages to be on the target for the full 36 seconds it will do 1287 damage.<br>
<br>
Ask yourself here..  if you, as a wizard, were given the ability to cast skinlike, resist buffs, sow, and DoTs, and Damage Shields would you feel overpowered?  Would you feel that giving up all your nukes would be a fair trade?<br>
<br>
2)  Yes, I can count, I just wanted to list healing last because that's really the most compelling argument.  Druids can heal as well as do all those other abilities, however small an improvement over wizards those improvements may be.  Healing is a very powerful ability.  It can help win fights, and it can reduce downtime.   <br>
<br>
However, I have two points.  First, when a druid chooses to heal in combat, he sacrifices mana and aggro to do so.  A druid using heals in combat will never nuke as well as a wizard, short term or long term, not even close.  A druid using any sort of heal to reduce downtime will not nuke as well as a wizard in the long term, even if the druid could use wizard nukes.  Second, there exists situations where healing is not needed.  If natural regeneration, innate AC and resists, or clerical healing cover 100%(or hell even 80-90%) of the damage taken, then Druid heals really aren't helping at all.<br>
<br>
For the situations when all his other abilities are worthless, a druid needs something to do.  Nukes are the answer.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> The minor advantages in mana and speed, just dont cut it. They arent enough to make us the true specialists we are supposed to be.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
All classes have abilities that, at some point, will be totally useless.  Being totally useless is A Bad Thing, no class should ever be totally useless.  That's why all the melee classes can melee, and why all the casters can nuke.  In practice, the other classes do not spend 90% of their effort at damage dealing the way a wizard, rogue, magician, or monk would.  A cleric heals, a warrior uses defensive and high aggro weapons to tank, a paladin uses stuns to stop damage and a shield to take damage, a shaman slows and heals, even a mage might spend his time making T-Rods.  When those classes are doing those things, they fall way below the damage dealing abilities of the specialists.  However, on occaision, when they would otherwise be useless, the cleric can mem a nuke; the paladin puts away the shield, pulls out a big two hander, begs a haste, and starts dealing damage;  The warrior uses his most damaging weapons while avoiding aggro; the shaman, ok he pulls out his JBB; the mage uses his own mod rods and nukes.  <br>
<br>
Now, when all these other casters, their supposedly primary abilities made 100% useless by the presence of other abilities, are forced to nuke and only nuke, they <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>still</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> fall behind wizards.  This <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> almost</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> seems unfair.<br>
<br>
In normal situations, other casters do their thing with a little damage on the side, and wizards reign supreme in nuking damage.. no one comes close.  When other classes are otherwise useless, they close in on wizards.  Are wizard nukes ever made totally useless because of the group arrangement?  No.  While other classes can literally have abilities made useless by the presence of others, Wizards instead must simply accept not being quite so much better than everyone else.  (I'm talking relative to other casters here, melees are a different issue).<br>
<br>
The most notable exception to this, is the magicians who have their inferior but still powerful nukes, as well as a pet that is relatively less taxing on nuking resources than most other class abilities.  (clerics healing, shamans slowing, enchanters mezzing, etc. all force you to make more DD sacrifices than using a pet does)  The damage dealing of magicians was the topic of this thread, and I'll point you back to other discussion here for the magician comparison.  But in short, for the most, part magicians putting their best resources into damage dealing will match or fall slightly behind wizards in short term damage, while having a significant long term advantage.  The long term advantage is something that I think should be addressed from the wizard end by giving them more effecient damage dealing abilities.<br>
<br>
The final thing I'll say, is that after all of this, the actual damage number on the nuke seems relatively insignificant does it not?  It's important to wizards because it's fun to hit mobs really really hard, but from a balance perspective, it's basically irrelevant.  I could really care less whether or not the max damage of wizards level 34 nuke is better than mine.  That it isn't does not indicate a problem with class balance, however. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ushadextinkerdink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shadex Tinkerdink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/23/02 10:09:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=698.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: magic</span><hr size=1> First, I am a 56 mage on Brell...

Being that I have first hand knowledge of everything from the low to high end game on wizards and mages I must say that wizards definately deserve more damage across the board on all DD's or innately improved mana regen that is more significant than some crappy mental clarity aa ability.<br>
<br>
Although we can nuke very closely to wizards and and at some levels outnuke damage wise like 34 or out ae 51-56... ah wtf am i saying.  Other than the fact that i miss quad kiting and that its a little harder for me to get an ae group, wizards are really just mages without pets with ports... except for in raid situations.  Raiding SUCKS as a mage.  It SUCKS.  All we do is make mod rods and coh people.  Total BS.  I cant even use my damn epic that took me a year to do unless we are fighting a clearly single pull like vindi.  Mages on raids feel like how a wizard would feel if you were told to *only* cast okeils spells on the main tank.  Dont do anything else though!!!! you might nuke the wrong mob and break mes or something or draw aggro and die!!!!!<br>
<br>
Above balancing casters with casters, I think we need to be balanced against melees... we need to have focus items drop in game that are like +45% damage on Xtype of spell.  There should be a Primal Velium Sorcerors Staff where instead of primal avatar proc (+200 atk ~20% increase in damage on top of haste) some right click thing that does 40% (40% instead of 20 to compensate for the fact that the primal weapons have amazing ratios) increase to damage from evoc spells or something...<br>
whatever, there like 403853408 ways that wiz/mage vs otherclasses balancing can be done... i just wish VI would take a stand on some of them and implement instead of skirt around cowardly fearing flames from melees who dont know wtf they are talking about. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=58324">Shadex Tinkerdink's phat lewts.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/24/02 11:06:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=698.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages.... &lt;glare&gt;</span><hr size=1> Shadex, I'm just curious...

I rarely post but I read these threads everyday and generally get some good out of them.  That being said, here's something I feel complelled to say...<br>
<br>
(ahem) &quot;Get over yourself Goladus!&quot;<br>
<br>
Now... &quot;Why&quot;, you ask, &quot;Why,  has Andrael the beloved (my honey digs me anyway)  hermit taken a shot at Goladus?&quot;  <br>
<br>
Simple really.  This is a public board Goladus... jumping on old Grim with a &quot;HEY! This is between us buddy!!! back off!&quot;   Isnt just remarkably assumptive (This is YOUR board perhaps?) but frankly, pretty silly.  You want to have a private conversation? Send someone an e-mail.. a &quot;tell&quot;, heck make a phone call... whatever... but Grim can post here whenever he wants, as can you and I.  Check it out... here's proof!<br>
<br>
ON SUBJECT: There is little doubt in my mind that a mage pet is far more defensively valuable than wizzy skins, etc...  You can run from your pet -- giving you a chance, I cant run from my skin... My root gets resisted -- often -- your pet &quot;is&quot;, etc... etc.... you see where I'm coming from? They are all handy, they (and the rest) are all defensive... but inmho a mage does indeed have more defensive capabilities than a wizard thanks to that remarkable pseudo tank and root/dot combo... THE PET! (I have a necro alt, and I love my pet, can you tell?)<br>
<br>
Bu heres the point (to me at least.. this is an OPINION... ok?) THATS OK... a wizard, the ONLY int caster without a pet, was not supposed to be a defensive critter...we gave that up to be (ominious pause) the MASTERS OF DD!!!  (cackle... rub hands...)  However, we have watched as melee's specificly, but everyone in general has little by little encrouched on our nuke/damadge turf... and we simply want a bump up now in our DD.<br>
<br>
<br>
ps...  The point about wiz/mage numbers was (i think) to suggest that mages are better to play/more balanced as judged by numbers that make it to high levels...<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, drive through, never pay retail, never surrender!..and never deal with dragons, &quot;... for you are crunchy and taste good with catsup.&quot;<br>

Pillar of Flame - 952 x 4 = 3808 for 364 mana or something.  Don't feel like looking the spell up.  With like a 6 second casting time (I know I could be off slightly).   But calculate that as about ~635 damage per second.  Tell me any other class in the game capable of that?<br>

Or bring in an AE group.  684 x 30 = 20520 damage.  With a 2 second casting time.  Thats 10260 damage per second.  Please tell me we are underpowered.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying wizards are perfect or balanced to casters.  But Mages have nothing on us, so I really don't think we can compare ourselves to mages in anyway.  Yea mages have 1 AE, but it's still not as good as ours. <br>
<br>
Yea true, the spells I listed here are more on the higher end of the level scale.  But the other post 50 AE spells are just as impressive.  I'm not really going into the level 50 game, I grew up back when the servers were new and I was still powerful.  So i can't argue the pre-50 for the game today. <br>
<br>
But seriously, the only imbalance in this game for wizards is vs Melee.  None of the other casters have anything on us, except maybe Necro's for PvP.  I don't play in a PvP environment so I can't really argue that point either.  Although I have dueled and killed a few level 60 necro's.  Lures are not the solution when fighting them is all I can say. <br>
<br>
But in all seriousness, really...why compare mages and wizards.  We are different classes.  While Mages might have some similar spells in earlier levels (where wizards are supposed to be a weaker class).  We FAR outshine them in the end.  We far outshine any DD class in the end.

PSS. Plus I played on legends for a couple months.  We'd have like 10 60 wizards, but only 2 mages.  Same for about the other 2 high level guilds.  Lots of wizards, very very few mages.  Not many mages make it to 60 and stick with it.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ueelyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Eelyen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0> at: 5/6/02 11:26:57 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Err, Forum Arch Mage?</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/6/02 2:54:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=698.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Mages.... &lt;glare&gt;</span><hr size=1> Andrael, you're right, I was rude to Grimstaff and I apologize.  <br>
<br>
However, I think that I need to clarify a few things.  I was not trying to limit the discussion to just myself and Fynalwiz, the comment was directed at Grimstaff directly and if I had a good means of private communication available I would have used that.  Consider the posts I was replying to:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> See, you have a pretty odd philosophy about what a Wizard should be. Apparently you are of the opinion that Magicians should be better than Wizards in combat, and that a Wizards only edge should be as a taxi, moving the characters to where they need to go. How you can even remotely attempt to justify wanting to continue the already absurd situation where Mages can comfortably outdamage Wizards in the short term and ENORMOUSLY in the long term I can't imagine.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Here you have Grimstaff telling me what my philosophy about wizards is.  He's telling me what my opinion is.  (HINT:  He didn't get it quite right)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Fynal.. they are Mages, and when it comes to Wizard damage its really rare to find a Mage who has a real grip on reality.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is a just a blanket insult.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Even ones that are otherwise really lucid and do fairly well otherwise, when it comes to this, they all seem to get confused.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yet another blanket statement that was rather rude.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What comes next is an endless loop of explaining how Mage and Wizard utility is roughly equivalent, bitching about summons, pet pathing, how pets don't root, how crappy root is, etc, etc. It just is fruitless.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I disagree completely with this assessment of what is happening in the thread.  Traditionally, many wizards <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>and</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> many mages have used their lack of defensive skills as justification for requesting any amount of offensive power they want.   In any situation, the argument can only be used so far, and it often gets abused and overused.  Both wizards and mages tend to downplay the value of their own defensive abilities, because they think that if they can convince the other that they are in fact more defenseless, they are justified in having more offensive ability than the other.<br>
<br>
Grimstaff's assessment of what <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>typically</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> happens at this point is actually very accurate.  The thread goes into an endless loop because niether side is ever able win significant ground.  However, that is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>not</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> what happened in this thread.  This time, recognizing that the lack-of-defense argument is hopeless, the differing factions agree to compromise.  Since niether side has gained significant ground in the last year or so, we agree to just call them equal for the time being and move on.  This time we're specifically trying <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>not</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> to let the tired debate of who sucks more defensively ruin a good discussion about relative damage dealing capabilities.<br>
<br>
Except for Grimstaff.  I think that he is so firmly convinced that magicians have more defensive power than wizards that he will not let it be put aside.  It seems like he thinks our reasonable (and perhaps even temporary) compromise is a huge loss for wizards, and resorts to calling his opponents confused and lacking a grip on reality.  <br>
<br>
So, instead of wasting all my time re-explaining this (It's honestly covered fairly well in the first few pages of the thread), and having other mages get offended and jump on him, turning the thread into a flamefest or said endless loop of bitching about summons, pet pathing, etc. and ultimately having it end up in rants, I made a few brief comments that pretty much summed up what I thought about his offensive posts, and left it at that.  Again, I'm sorry that I was rude, I really could have handled the situation better.<br>
<br>
Now, Andrael, you seem to pretty much agree with Grimstaff on the defensive argument.  That's fine, I have no problem with that.  The difference between what you posted and what he posted was the insults and his declarations about the way things are, without bothering to mention or even imply that it's really just his own opinion.  Additionally, I tend to expect a little more from Grimstaff since he is such an experienced debater.  I try (though I do not always succeed) to be more tolerant of, and respectful to people who are inexperienced posters and especially those who new posters who present their opinions with diffidence rather than arrogance.<br>
<br>
As it is, I really don't have much to say in response to your &quot;ON SUBECT&quot; portion of the post, because it's really a part of that whole defensive argument I'm trying to avoid here.  While I certianly think it's valid of you to think that mage pets are better than your defensive spells, in my experience I would say that there are probably an equal number of mages with an equally valid but opposite opinion. <p><center>

A couple thoughts.  I think if you look at the class as a whole (&lt;50 game) the point is still solid.  You can talk about quading with a high level pillar of fire all day, but thats not whats gonna happen in the game in a group and not applicable to low/mid level chgaracters.  In an exp group or a raid, if you start AoE casting you wont be in a group long, yes?  So, anyway, back to your point, you are only talking about the high end game and I agree with you its fine by then I understand.<br>
<br>
BTW: I'm not attaking mages for heavens sake, we were simply discussing defensive strengths vis the pet (heh heh... and how anyone can post on a board).   For the record, if what I hear is true, I really feel for any mage working on his epic -- It sounds insane. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usilverbladetheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silverblade the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/7/02 2:43:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=698.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/artofadreamer/3d/excaliburthumb1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I can dig it, sortof</span><hr size=1> Hm...<br>
Well basic facts are:<br>
1) Outdoors at higher levels, wizards have better defences if have snare or root memmed.<br>
2) Indoors (except in wide spaces) mages have better defence if have pet up.<br>
3) Wizards have little prep time, mages do.<br>
4) Wizards have advantage of being able to chnage location to find good hunting areas easily.<br>
5) Wizards lack heavy damage over time.<br>
6) Mage epic is wonderful but quest is GAWD AWFUL.<br>
7) Wiz nukes are more aggro (have a friend played both classes at high lvl and he says the difference is very telling)<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Mage pets often eat 50% of xp soloing, wiz nukes don't.<br>
9) All casters were screwed to an extent with Kunark but HUGELY with Velious.<br>
10) There are very few high lvl mages, on Karana, highest populations server normally, other day 13 lvl 60 mages, 19 NON anon 60 wizards.<br>
11) Soloing for best xp as wiz requires a suitable quadding area, which are rare. <br>
12) Soloing for a mage requires few adds and non *inflated* mobs that shred pets.<br>

Try crossing many outdoors zones as a mage.<br>
You can have the pet up, or Invisibility, not both.<br>
If oyu have the pet up it's highly likely to attract aggro on its own, never mind you. Note also many Kunark zones mobs see invis.<br>
mages have *no* way to deal with mobs bar nuke/pet/run.<br>
Until lvl 54 when you get Scars of Sigil (450 hp bolt fire 2 sec cast). So generally for a hell of a long time mages have to run like hell to avoid ANY mob that isnt utterly utterly green.<br>
For example I aggroed a drolvarg rager in DL, what would a wiz do? it was light blue to me at 60, it got me to about        2/3 or 1/2 health at lvl 60 as I nuked it down with Scars.<br>
(just decided that enough was enough and that day I was NOT oging to run and the MOB was gonna get vaped:&gt;)<br>
I coudltn use my epic, 20 sec cast time, sure cant run over DL with epic up, recast it all tim each zone ugh no way.<br>
<br>
See what I mean? Wiz would snare/root nuke, epic absorb damage, few worries.<br>
<br>
Indoors, say Lguk, I can use pet as a battering ram and mob destroyer, few worries on mana (real nuisance on wizzies indoors is going OOM, wizzies need high lvl UBER efficient low damage nuke for dealing with greens etc lik 500 hp 100 mana at lvl 60), but I have to learn and deal with nutsoid pathing (Guk's pretty good that way, try the Hole, its sick)<br>

Run works well most times. If its a dangerous area where mobs see invis then the pet makes things alot less dangerous. I have done this myself and consider it alot safer then root.<br>

Actualy, running is the best way for wizards too. Snare is probobly the worst way as you risk snaring yourself if you try it in melee. Root works well if its not a very dangerous mob. If its dangerous then gate is safest. Why? Because if you get a resist then you havent gotten any closer to safety. If you manage gate then you are safe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=698.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=698.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=698.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=698.topic&start=81&stop=82>5</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=698.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=698.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=698.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=698.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=698.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=698.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=698.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
