I think the common cry from the masses of wizards should be that ONE of those TWO supposedly &quot;dead horses&quot; needs to be rezzed. I would prefer the mana regen side because I really have to agree with Graffe's initial observation that DAMAGE = AGGRO. <br>
<br>
What mana regen would do is allow the wizard to take good tactics and do them more often than sitting out every other pull because your &quot;low mana light&quot; went on after the last fight. The more times you can stand up and take the mob from the 50% HP stage to the run stage, and thereby bypassing that frenzy stage when the mob really lets the melees have it, the better you will be looked upon by any given group. Even with the chanter doing traffic duty, there still one or two mobs that are slapping your meat shields around. With better mana regen you can be there to help them out in a very profound manner. <br>
<br>
My total levels achieved is 66 in EQ spread out among three characters. I've seen battle and good grouping strats from everyside of the ball, so to speak. Offensively with a Wizard for 26 levels, up front banging away with a warrior to the 20th level, and then lately, crowd control and buffing\debuffing with my near 20th chanter. So, I've been the OOM wizard AND the tank whose heard the OOM cries of the wizard who couldnt help me with the mob in the frenzy stage as it hit me for significantly more HPs than during the early stages of the fight. <br>
<br>
I just hope that one of those &quot;dead horses&quot; is rezzed, saddled up and made truly trail worthy so I didn't waste 26 levels on a wizard who is not group friendly for the aforestated reasons. <br>

Summon Mob<br>
Bannish Mob<br>
<br>
The 1st would summon a targeted mob to you - i.e. You shall not Evade me a_mob_01! I believe this game mechanic was meant for teleporters - the new wizard definition- and would bring a great new attribute to our class (I am positive this would make us wanted in groups). Face it, no one cares about our damage because we will always be inferior to a mana-less tank. Nothing will change that (besides a total rehall of damage spells and better caster gear for mid range characters). It would have a casting range and maybe a line of sight needed (as the game mechanics now function). I would LOVE this spell.<br>
The second line would bannish a mob back to its bindpoint, removing all agro unless the people were still in agro range (i.e. along Mez agro lines - although would have to be more reliable). Also would make us useful for crowd control as well. I don't think this steps on chanter's toes. Maybe it would Kill the mob as well -a.k.a disinegrate sub 60 wizards.<br>

<br>
1.  How about VI lowering the resistance rates on mobs?  As a wizard and specialist in dd why do I need some other class to land malosi or whatever so I can land a spell?  The answer simply is that I shouldn't.  The problem began with VI's limited imagination for increasing difficulty via mobs with oodles of hps and high resists.  I'm still not crazy about non-god mobs with a zillion hps...but just lower their resist rates so I can land my spells for full damage and I'll grin and bear it.<br>
<br>
2.  The main contributor to the cheapening of the EQ experience is all the crazy melee equipment out there which can give a melee to do melee and spell damage.  VI should either take many of those items out of the game, which of course they wont, or give us some half decent  equipment that isn't +whatever intelligence.  Show some creativity in design and throw us a bone here with some decent equipment.<br>
<br>
3.  As said before, remove the hard 6 level cap - enough said<br>
<br>
4.  Finally, VI should stop giving mobs more and more hps with meaner and meaner aes and come up with some creative mobs.  Perhaps some mobs that can't be hit with melee.  perhaps some mobs that can only be hit with a certain line of spells.  The possibilities are endless.<br>

More damage will only get us killed. As it is now the agro's on us is screwed up already. Case in point, I was in Hand / Warlord, pull of 2 comes in. One mob is mezzed, 1 is engaged. Mez breaks on second mob and immediately smacks me. I am across the room, have never even casted a single spell yet (I was LOM hehe). Why did it go after me and not the chanter or cleric?<br>
<br>
But I digress, Verant has to fix the rain spells and lure spells. Playing around with Tears of Solusek doesn't seem to offer less resists than Druzzil. They really need to lower the resist rates on these spells, I'd say I probably land about 50% of the rains. Lowering resists on this line would not empower us to solo more. Who ever uses a rain while soloing? Next fix the lure line of spells so that they hit mobs as intended, virtually unresistable. Not, totally unresistable when your draught would have landed anyway. Or, your lure might land if you use the right one and the RNG likes you. Come on, a 25% hit rate on Spite Golems is unacceptable for a spell that supposed to be unresistable and has a terrible mana/damage ratio.<br>
<br>
We also need some other type of single target DD spell between 51 and 60. I would imagine that a wizard in gaining nine levels of experience would have learned a few more tricks. Not just instead of draught of fire, it took me 3 levels to learn the same spell but just magic based now. Most melees gain power exponentially in their 50s. There is really no difference between a 51 and 56 wizzie in normal battle situations except for a slightly larger mana pool. Pit a 56 warrior against a 51 warrior, there's a huge difference !!<br>

/disagree Graffe (but understand)<br>
<br>
Ok fine, we pay for supposed ability to do fast damage with lower damage output, but there has to be SOME parity.<br>
<br>
It's all about the numbers.<br>
<br>
Even though I came up with an idea like mob summon, and others, I really don't like them, and would prefer the base problem to be addressed.<br>
<br>
It's easy enough to compare short term damage per second and long term damage per hour. Compare DoT's that can be stacked by Necros and Druids, and their DD, Mages, pets and their DD. Average dmg of Cleric/Warrior, Cleric/Warrior/Ench, etc, all this is easy with log analyzers but you really don't even need them to do that.<br>
<br>
We fall TOO low, and pay TOO big a price in total damage per hour for the short term damage per second.<br>
<br>
There's about as manay ways as there are Wizards posting to address this, and some are even good.<br>
<br>
I hate to say this but the truth is the only thing that matters is the *numbers*, anything else is just chit chat. Don't let them get away with any RP based excuses.<br>
<br>
Don't let them get away from the real issue.<br>
<br>
I REALLY don't want to get some new high level &quot;class defining&quot; I just want to do comparable damage per hour.<br>
<br>
COMPARABLE. Not MORE. Just COMPARABLE.<br>
<br>
They need to say, ok here's how it is<br>
<br>
Solo - Damage per hour - highest to lowest list classes<br>
 <br>
XP Group - Damage per hour - highest to lowest list classes<br>
<br>
Raid - Damage per hour - highest to lowest list classes<br>
<br>
And then we say well, look why are Wizards on the bottom but have nothing else but damage to offer groups?<br>
<br>
(pre/post taxiing is not acceptable) <br>
<br>
It would be lovely if you could just get their _reasoning_ behind the current state of affairs.<br>
<br>
But I know they won't do what they should, we'll get mob summon or mob warp or mob anti magic shell or something, which WILL make us useful, but as many have said &quot;this ain't what I signed on for&quot;<br>

Because the melee classes don't have to use mana to do their damage, and because the Magician offers the damage with two out of three irresistable sources, and the damage is steady and long term.<br>
<br>
Wizards would do their damage fast and furious, and be out or low on mana, while the Magician can burn and med while damage shields and pets continue to contribute.  Magicians freak out when they hear this, all they see is &quot;same damage over time and less in the short term! AEIIII!!!&quot; but they haven't thought it through to see the reality of the issue.<br>
<br>
Honestly, putting a superfast, lower damage, low mana efficiency (half the normal blast that level, for example) for emergencies is a good idea for a series of blasts.  This could be every 2 spell circles.  The logic behind this is the shot you use in the absolute emergency, something to uncork that is VERY fast, like 2 seconds or shorter.<br>
<br>
Then add in a HUGE blast every 2 spell circles, alternating with the fast emergency blast above.  This blast would have a LONG casting time (fury of ice, fury of fire, etc... takes 6 seconds to cast at level 20, as an example... slower as you go up levels) doing 1 1/2-2 times the damage of the blast that level.  The mana efficiency could be terrible for this too, the idea is that it is for that &quot;MUST DIE NOW&quot; or closing shot, but worthless in soloing.  This would have a long recast time on it and perhaps a reagent.<br>
<br>
Lures at lower levels of course, something like Enticement of Frost at level 20 that does 85 damage but is nearly irresistable and costs Force Shock level mana.  This would allow people to contribute against things over the level cap.<br>
<br>
See how that works?  3 more TYPES of blast to add to the aresenal that don't have a real major effect on our damage output, but would give us TOOLS for specific types of situations and encounters.</font><P><P><i></i></TD></TR><TR BGCOLOR=#33333><TD NOWRAP width=20% valign=top align=left><B><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=2><A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufaithkills.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faithkills</A></FONT></B><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>Forum Apprentice</FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>(</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>5/11/01</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1 COLOR=#ffffff>2:23:47 pm</FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial" SIZE=1>)<BR></FONT></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=LEFT><B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">Re: Total Damage Per Hour</font></B><HR><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Verdana,Arial">I suggested something similar on the sony boards right before they were closed, and got the same &quot;but 6 wizards..&quot; nonesense.<br>
<br>
But no it has to be MORE mana efficient not less.<br>
<br>
I even had the spell examples but I'm not going to redo them, but basically LONG cast time BIG booms with a stun afterwards, that are maybe .5 more efficient than the similar level shock.<br>
<br>
People picked nits, but the idea being a big nuke that would be only usefull in groups. With efficiency that would put us into the range of damage per hour of other classes. I think a long casting time nuke with a stun after would do the trick.<br>
<br>
Basically double the cast time, but only three halves the mana of the contemporary nuke with a ten second stun. (tweak the numbers as you like, but put us nearly as damage per hour as other classes)<br>

Channel Fire, Channel Ice, Channel Magic, I had full spell descriptions but they were deleted with the board and the details aren't important anyway.<br>

Wizards should be the artillery. The artillery cannot stand alone, but the infantry should WANT artillery. (and as a vet of the 101st, I can tell you in RL they do, believe me) I think it is obvious Wizards were designed to be the artillery, but somewhere along the way VI got very VERY confused.<br>
<br>
They got confused because they couldn't figure out a way to make the artillery want to keep the infantry around. It was simple, these spells would do it, and there are many other ideas. But for some reason the solution was beyond them.<br>
<br>
So now what we have is a case where the infantry has no use for the artillery because they do better without it!!<br>
<br>
That is patently fup-ucked.<br>
<br>
I WOULD GIVE UP *ALL* PORTS TO BE THE ARTILLERY LIKE WIZARDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.<br>
<br>
Necros and Mages were designed to be solo classes, and are, but turned out to be bigger damage dealers. (granted against some mobs, being mana battery is no fun, but at least it's a DESIRED ROLE)<br>
<br>
Clerics and Warriors are pretty much what they are supposed to be.<br>
<br>
Shaman and Enchanters are pretty much what they were supposed to be, as are the hybrids and rogues.<br>
<br>
Druids can do everything, and track on top.<br>
<br>
I don't want to see one other class nerfed.<br>
<br>
Wizards are supposed to be all offense, no defense. You don't send artillery alone to fight a battle. But you also should always want artillery when you can get it.<br>
<br>
I just want my role *in* the battle.<br>
<br>
