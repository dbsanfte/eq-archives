The only thing that I have a problem with is that, to me, this seems like a lame event.  When I read the information that Zealpath gave on the event, my opinion of the tone was that what was required was extremely trivial for such an item.  The way the encounter was described, it was over before it began.  And Zealpath was able to make up some bullshit to get himself selected as the wizard.  There was no sense whatsoever of it being either challenging or that the wizard chosen deserved the item.  I would like to see items of this nature given out from events that are challenging and the person who ends up with the item can be proud that they, using their skills and abilities, succeeded where other wizards failed.  And that's not even mentioning that some people were able to get the item by camping Al'Kabor; that's how an acquaintance of mine was able to get it.  I just have a problem with Verant's method of implementing quests and GM events, in general.  I mean, really, this is the best they can come up with?<br>
<br>
I can't help but compare it with the shawl quest that I've been working on.  Yes, I know this is an artifact item, but here it has mana regen: 10 and if I ever manage to finish the 7th shawl, I will have a mana regen: 1 item.  Altogether, I've spent days of my life working on this shawl.  And has there been a shred of fun anywhere in all that? No.  So I'm wasting my time doing something that would be more appropriately described as excruciating rather than enjoyable, for what exactly?  Hmm, I think I went off on a little tangent there.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><hr>

I was online when Big Al showed up to do the quest. Did I go? Hell no, just the thought of smooching ass with Big Gay Al for the chance at some staff was enough to make me continue playing /gems.<br>
<br>
I understand on one server he made 2 wizards actually /RANDOM on it!! Another Slap!<br>
<br>
Yeah lame-o. I hold no grudge for the peeps that sucked ass to get it. You guys just couldn't help yourselves. I forgive you. And if you didn't have to suck ass Big Al must have really liked what he saw under that robe. *wink*.  How else was it determined?<br>
<br>
Camped AL??? HAHA OMG you are right though! I can't believe it for first time I can see people actually camped a GM quest.<br>
<br>
Would have been truely nice if it was a test of skills of some sort. My god what an unimaginative GM event for such an oh-so-mega-staff as compared to most of the shit they usually hand out.<br>
<br>
Verant, you blew it again for the wizard community. But I forgive you. You just can't help yourselves.<br>

I thought what they did was pretty damn good.  They picked a Wizard to get a group of friends together to get something back to Al`Kabor.  In return, Al`Kabor gives you all something.<br>
<br>
Now, the quest reward is fine.  They've given out stuff like this just for roleplaying (the 50AC shield went to a level 12 on our server).  I thought this quest was great...<br>

<br>
(Actually I never gave it much a passing thought till I started to troll these boards <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
It was kind of my rant against the way GM events are done altogether. And especially any involving AL.<br>
<br>
What does bother me is that all the unlucky wizards who attended that didn't get LUCKY enough to get picked I feel sorry for. Like I said, I didn't attend that is how little I cared about it really.<br>
<br>
But really if AL was going to give out a nice item and then 5 trinkets, the cheap bastard could have at least given out a trinket for EVERY wizard that bothered to attend.<br>
<br>
But then again verant is so fucking worried about too much loot or whatever their lame-o argument would be. Jeesh anything would of sufficed, even some stupid token saying &quot;I WAS AT BIG GAY AL'S COMING OUT PARTY&quot; woulda been nice.<br>
<br>
I don't think that would have been asking the world. In fact, it would have had the opposite effect. I would have changed my tune altogether. I would be saying:<br>
<br>
AL KABOR IS A WHORE NO MORE!<br>

Personally I think the series of Al'Kabor stuff was awesome.  I like what they did and they're focusing on him because he's playing a big role in Luclin.<br>
<br>
On a side note, camping a GM event for this stuff is extreamly fucked up and people need to get their heads examined.  Sowwy!  That's how I feel.<br>

<br>
If that comment was intended to include my point of view on this, you are way off the mark kiddo.<br>
 My INT stat is currently 164...fully dressed for battle.<br>
Considering that wizards revolve around acquiring gear for mana and INT, just what kind of wonderful and hard to obtain items do you think I am wearing?<br>
Yep, I am a pauper as a wizard...simply hop on Tribunal and ask anyone in United Norrathian Knights if &quot;Theorv/Orv&quot; has any &quot;uber&quot; gear. They will spam you with laughs until you go linkdead.<br>
<br>
And to put it bluntly...from my &quot;adult&quot; perspective...you are behaving poorly on this topic. Especially when you resort to namecalling (i.e. &quot;collection of assholes&quot;).<br>
<br>
You are welcome to rant, that is what this area is for.<br>
Get it off your chest, then see how others feel on the topic.<br>
But you must also understand...that it doesn't make you right.<br>
Backup, read the replies, think, rethink...GROW.<br>
<br>
My point isn't an attempt to flame you...or to troll you into anger.<br>
It is merely in the simple hope that you can reconsider your frustration a tad, and thereby find the game much more enjoyable from a more realistic and reasonable viewpoint.<br>
Certainly, getting nice gear is fun. But it shouldn't be so all consumingly important that you feel angry when someone else gets something that is one of a kind.<br>

Hey, if you want to rant go for it.. but prepared to get ranted back at.  Go read my thread again... it wasn't particularly aimed at you but the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   many</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> people who posted and were upset because they didn't get it.<br>

How did you get Big Al's attention or did he do a secret /random? No really I am serious I just want to know how you were deemed the lucky wizard. Right place right time?<br>
Did you have to break down and /roleplay? Is that something you have to be good at?  Did you say anything that caught his eye? Or do you think he just liked your haircut?<br>

You know we would all have a little more respect for the event and the people that got them if one of you just came out and said, &quot;Guys, I just milked some PHAT LEWT gear off that LOSER AL BABY!&quot;.<br>
<br>
You can then add a &quot;And you guys can kiss my ass!&quot;  We would certainly deserve that. And I would be the first to /applaud. (hell I applaud you anyway.) But please ease up on your defense of Big AL.  You got the staff, he won't take it back! He don't read these boards anyway no more.<br>
<br>
Anyway its probably something that I would post if I got the staff <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Do I show contempt or what? Contempt for all things AL KABORIOUS mind you. Not you. Jealous? No way. <br>
<br>
I say hell yeah to your staff! You go wizard! And tell the rest of us to kiss Al's big fat hairy hiney! And after I do that, I would light a lure or 2 in his rectum. <br>
<br>
Actually AL would never deem me worthy. He would see through my bullshit right away, my cover would be blown and I would run around like a screaming lunatic trying to land a Spectral Shackle on him. Just for the fun of it.<br>

They have a term appropriate to this behavior...no matter how the poster tries to rationalize or qualify it.<br>
<br>
Poor Sportsmanship.<br>
<br>
I am big on this, along with honesty, player respect, courtesy, and setting an example.<br>
The only time it can be overlooked is when you roleplay, and only if others KNOW you are roleplaying. That is REALLY what the /roleplay tag was intended for, not as a /hide function.<br>
<br>
It's a social game...so these things do indeed count, because they affect the game quality for those around you.<br>
 Enough so that I created a guild based on it a couple years ago.<br>
I retired as guildleader due to time constraints about 8 months ago and I'm enjoying my status as guild &quot;old fart&quot;, but the rules still hold strong.<br>
Bad attitudes and behavior degrade the playing experience for all those exposed to it...simple fact, not fiction.<br>
I encourage everyone playing to try and keep this in mind while in Norrath.<br>

How about Jyll, who  came up with GOOD spells that wizards LOVE?  Tishan, Markar, either of these two would also be acceptable, they provide utility to the class, and the wizards.  What has Al'Kabor given us to date:<br>
<br>
A line of AOE spells that take way too much mana for their damage output and are considered a waste of mana.<br>
<br>
Translocates as a way to help others since they complained to Verant about a lack of people to port them.  Remember that porting people who arn't in our XP group can't be considered an &quot;In Character&quot; act, so it's only to benefit others.<br>
<br>
A super easy quest, one parter that takes virtually no skill to complete for an item that provides what wizards should have been given from the beginning.<br>
<br>
The new shoulder piece that doesn't add mana, and is more suited to a melee class than it is a wizard.  If it's part one, then fine, but lets face it, wouldn't you rather get +1 mana/tick than 100HP?  When all mobs hit for over 100 in the 50+ game anyway, being able to take one extra hit from a mob really excites us?<br>
<br>
<br>
So, with all that CRAP(Translocates help others, not us), most of us object to the ease of the quest, not to the sceptre itself.  We also object to Al'Kabor for being an idiot.  <br>

This staff is NOT, I repeat, NOT the only item in the game obtainable by a Wizard that provides Flowing Thought II as the effect.  White Dragonscale Boots are one such item.  And if you look on the armor pages here at www.graffe.com I think you will find that they are better than the staff to begin with.<br>
<br>
They are difficult to obtain, but NOT impossible.  It's a quest.  Look it up  =)<br>
