Its not hard to get a 6 second nuke off at the start of a fight. While you can avoid it by running there is a difference between a rogue running with a wizard trailing and the opposite situation.  The rogue is fleeing, the wizard is kiting.<br><br>Duelist = chance to kill, unless you get snared which you shouldn't if you are apropriately geared. You should never take more than 1 round of duelist dmg ever.  Its simply to easy to move and avoid that dmg for there to be any excuse.  For that round to be dangerous it has to include a backstab attempt because a few duelist melee hits wont do that much dmg (hint don't show your back), If the rogue happens to get this round + bs in your still talking about 0-2 backstabs and 0-4 swings.  Note 1/3 of melee hits miss vs even con players who don't wear weak cloth ac. Also note double bs goes off roughly 40% at 55 and I think not more than 50% later on due to double attack skill going up.<br><br>This means that with 50% doubles you get...<br><br>23% no landed bses<br>55% 1 landed bs<br>22% 2 landed bses<br><br>Add to that the fact that bses unlike lures usually don't hit for full (just a guess here but I'm guessing average dmg unbuffed will be 450-500) and consider the fact that if it almost kills but not quite the wizard has a good chance to yonder outdoors.

Only way you can get killed is if you turn on autorun and go afk.&quot;<br><br>Thing is a wizard being chased IS kiting he can and will try to get space between you and cast draughts or lures.<br><br>A rogue being chased is just running for his life because he knows if he stops and tries to put up a fight hes as good as mannaburned and dead. This is why moving to avoid spell dmg is less viable then moving to avoid melee dmg. You can move to avoid melee dmg 100% of the time between casts and still fight.  We melees have to stick it out and stay close and try to interupt or else flee.  Moving to avoid nukes is only a strategy to avoid getting nuked before you can close the distance and start beating on the caster.  Clear enough yet?<br><br>&quot;It takes far less costly gear to get to 4k buffed then it takes to be able to get max mb for 4k (it doesnt always hit for max to so sure is not the word to use).&quot;<br><br>Epic + crafted hp rings + dwarf quest + various items wont get me much over 2k unbuffed at 60 as a rogue and or to around 3500 with cleric, shaman, ranger hp buffs and I really think in a 1 on 1 comparison the former total is a lot more meaningful.  In a 1 on 1 fight mannaburn even with ghetto gear will basicly always kill me. Fully buffed by 3 different classes I'm still basicly a twitching pile of overcooked meat if I get mannaburned by someone not on a corpse run.<br><br>Regarding miss ratio.<br><br>&quot;Ah, like casters you mean?&quot;<br><br>I was actually talking about the cloth that drops in newbie zones rather than the cloth that drops in saaaay PoG, 2nd floor of hate, dwarf city quest. Idealy your gear when fighting a rogue consists of AC and hp + enough pr to resist poisons. There is no reason why you should run oom fighting a rogue unless you use a lot of resistable nukes on a guy with high fr cr.  I decently equiped caster has enough AC that the miss ratio should be signifigant. This is just how melee dmg works. Only green mobs allow you to hit most of time.<br><br>&quot;You may not know about it, but casters have this skill called meditation that requires sitting. &quot;<br><br>Amazing simply amazing.

This is why moving to avoid spell dmg is less viable then moving to avoid melee dmg. You can move to avoid melee dmg 100% of the time between casts and still fight. We melees have to stick it out and stay close and try to interupt or else flee. Moving to avoid nukes is only a strategy to avoid getting nuked before you can close the distance and start beating on the caster.

Our goal should be a balanced and sane pvp environment.  As far as rogues. Well I don't think we are imbalanced in the slightest.

Yes Mr. Wizard you too can now be good at high end pvp! and a cheer is heard throughout the land! Am I right?  But wait verant is going to take it away! It must be because of the whiners.  All those overpowered melees crying to verant. Those golem wand using, backstabbing, /disc killing sons of bitches!  <br><br>We'll guys it's not.  It's being taken away because its overpowered. It's being taken away because it breaks high end pvp.  It's being taken away because of the idiots who mannaburn someone then go afk in the nexus till mannaburn comes back then do it again, then again, then again.  It's being taken away because this is not how pvp is supposed to be.<br><br>Let me tell you something about pvp.  Everyone who doesn't play pvp agressively sucks. Big time.  Because you lose the advantage that initiating the fight and choosing the battlegrounds gives you.  This is nowhere more true than talking about wizards and rogues whose main defense is a very strong offense and how give up versatility for offensive power.  Wizards imo don't suck.  They just suck at defending themselves when they get attacked. They also suck as much indoors as rogues do in open spaces. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/11/02 4:06:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am sick and tired of people bitching about mb</span><hr size=1> Hi, I play a level 60 wiz on RZ, I've been level 60 for a super long time I was like the 5th level 60 wiz on RZ, including those who exploited XP ressed to get 60 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>That being said, I do not have manaburn yet, since I have not been playing much for about 4 months. I can nonetheless comment on what wizard PvP was _before_ manaburn.<br><br>The casting of _any_ regular DD is too random to be of any use. You won't do a dent to anyone with good resists. The only spell that you can cast reliably in PvP are lures. Now the problem with lures is that they are 4.5 second casting. This can be brought down to 4.0 if you have a level 3 CLASS AA ability.<br><br>With a 4.5 casting spell, from the moment a melee with jboots (or even now with run 3) enters casting range and the moment the melee is on me, there is a little over 2 seconds. This is not eevn time to get of a 3.0 normal DD, much less a 4.5 lure without being hit.<br><br>My testing shows that the channeling of a 4.5 second level 60 lure (our only good damage lure) is of about 25% (figure taken against a monk with a T-Staff) after about 2 seconds melle against him.<br><br>That means to do 825 x 0.66 = 519 damage to a melee I need to be on average hit in melee for an equivalent of 4x 2 seconds lets say about 4x 200 damage (I'm being really nice here)<br><br>Also remember that after this I have a melee on my tail, and I need to run from him, and be able to cast yonder _and_ get a good distance yonder, all this without getting hit.<br><br>Does this sound fair for a wiz vs. melee? Does this sound balanced?<br><br>Wiz are very good vs. other int based casters because they do less DPS to us and much less reliably, pets aren't all a problem, except for epic mage pets who do _huge_ damage, with a proc over 200 damage that's hard to resist, but still they can be dealt with.<br><br>The problem in PvP lies with the fact that in general int casters &lt; melee. And that the int casters best pvp weapon is gate. Maybe for Mr. Rogue the best defense is offense, but for the most offensive INT caster class, the best defense, and might I add the best PvP tactic once you are faced with a melee in single combat is gate. Now, I might add that gate is overpowered, because being able to have a clean getaway is a very important advantage, but is there a possibility that this same wizard is going to take down that melee? No.<br><br>Wiz &gt; int casters in PvP<br>Wiz &lt; melee in PvP<br><br>And as a matter of fact with manaburn it's pretty much the same thing. Wizards are single shotting OTHER int casters, not melees, because other casters can't run up to melee range and interrupt you.<br><br>That's in my eyes the greateest problem with MB, it favors wiz vs. other casters, where wiz were balanced, but does not change much to wiz vs. melee. <p>Aurore<HR>~Seekers of Divinity~<BR>Sorceress of <a href=http://www.ralloszek.net>Rallos Zek</a><BR><a href=http://www.progressquest.com><img src=http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~bnguyen/pony.gif></img></a>The Pony with the Pointy Hat.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ushimone.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Shimone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/11/02 7:01:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I am sick and tired of people bitching about mb</span><hr size=1> What all the whiners seem to discount is that manaburn = 6 second casting time.
