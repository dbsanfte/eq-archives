&quot;Melees damage is lessened when I MOVE, as you say, but turning my back and fleeing from a rogue, for instance, isn't always guaranteed to help my cause  Melees can continue doing damage when they chase, I cannot.<br>

You fail to mention pumice and golem wands for removing levitate, how interesting. Oh and being able to kill people through walls is fantastic, so fantastic I've done it maybe once. 99% of PvP on sullon zek (not Rallos Zek, where you aren't sure who your enemy is) is done when you know about where your opponent is after the first attack. Also, I need to target my opponent first to nuke him, and that means being able to see him. If a melee finds me in a dungeon, I am in deep trouble, so your example of PvP in a dungeon is honestly a toss up.  <br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Actually if your a class with a commandable pet all you need to do is /pet attack name, /assist pet to get them on target without ever comming near them then just run around spamming a spell key till they are in range.  You can also try targeting them and hiding somewhere to nuke or any number of ideas.<br>
<br>
About pumice...if they have 2 insta buff items like jboots and grim aura earing they can nullify the effect of pumicing by reclicking them and keeping them on top.<br>
<br>
About wands...you can't use them in every fight if you don't have plat comming out of...<br>

Yes, thanks for telling me The Trick! /sarcasm off. I can place my back into a corner and still get chain interrupted (yes, I have done this). Oh you say life better at lvl 60? Gee why did I choose to be lvl 58 and not 60, silly me!<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Actually I was told there was a signifigant channeling buff by gaining 60 that isn't described by any skill increase... by a caster. This would make sense considering 60 rogues claim that there is a noticable difference as far as dmg just by gaining 60 more so than skill caps would acount for.  Btw its not just the increase in channeling at 60.  Channeling skilll really is based on a loc comparision between the start and the end of the cast and you really can counter the movement of melee dmg by moving back a hair.<br>

Wrong, yet again. Rogue, Warrior or Shadow knight disciplines can do 1000damage in PvP and are practically instant. <br>

Umm... people are allowed to move in Everquest, thanks for the new information.<br>

There is a lot of difference between the fact that running in a circle or fleeing makes you almost 100% immune to my dmg (have been right on a casters ass for several minutes without a single melee hit) and the fact that I can avoid the odd mega nuke here and there (that I would in almost all cases be better off trying to interupt) by moving out of range.  You can't even do it with draughts and lures to any real degree.  The only way I can land sure hits is if I can move faster than you.  Say I'm sowed and you have neither sow nor jboots or if your poisoned.<br>

Hmm, I guess hitting auto attack and the backstab button does require fine motor skills. Btw, I have heard a rogue in my guild claim he can backstab people from the front due to some weird bug no doubt. In my experience, backstabs in pvp are a sure thing.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I guess fighting someone with all the manueverability and skill of a rotting treestump would take about zero skill but real pvpers ya know...move around and try to turn to avoid bses.  Its not a bug the trick is to run by them and hit bs as you pass exactly behind them and its not as easy as it sounds. Bses are far from a sure thing and I bet your &quot;pvp experience&quot; is on a blue server. Just the fact that you say bses are a sure thing indicates your lack of skill.<br>

 Armor class is about the least used statistic in PVP (which is the point of this thread if you guys haven't realized yet).<br>

Actually AC is a huge factor in melee vs melee pvp and is somewhat of a factor vs pet classes but I was speaking of HP anyway.<br>

 Oh, it's amusing how you fail to mention a lvl 60 rogue can with not a lot of difficulty (or AAexp points like a wiz mb) kill a int caster in 1 melee round, IE /disc, backstab. A shadow knight can do almost the same with harmtouch and a couple life taps. A warrior can do almost the same, especially if he manages to land a stun kick and /disc. And don't forget monk and rangers can do a little damage to!  This is how it's 'supposed to be'?<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Sk are overpowered (duh). Duelist isn't anything close to a sure kill unless you are medding unbuffed with your back to your attacker.  If so you deserve to die anyway.<br>

Wait, so melees can't MOVE away if they are in trouble?  Don't forget that when a melee is chasing someone, he can keep inflicting damage, while if a caster is moving, it severly lessens his ability to cast spells heh.<br>
By the way, if you think my robe puts up a good defense to your epic dagger, you need to remove your head from your behind.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Actually I can't keep dmging someone running from me. If they are dumb enough to run in a straight line I will get occasional hits.  A little bit of weaving and server prediction isn't good enough to hit you AT all.<br>
<br>
&quot;seriously, I am not surprised that a rogue, of all melees, is spouting his pvp wisdom at me as to why the current pvp status quo should be kept intact sans manaburn. Obviously, things are NOT balanced in *real* pvp (IE non-rallos zek pvp).&quot;<br>
<br>
So you think rogues are the gods of pvp rofl? <br>
<br>
Also, if you thought things were unbalanced before, just wait til your local monster melee gets a hold of the new 74/95 2hb (everquest.allakhazam.com/...tem=10201)<br>
<br>
Wow an item that every class but me can use to hit for around what I bs for. Sweet! /sarcasm off<br>
<br>
In response to nerfs being the wrong way to go about it.  Sometimes nerfs really are the best way to go about it.  Even if every class were buffed to mannaburn wizzie lvl as far as pvp would it really be fun?  Do you really want to play everquake with less gameplay and a half hour to 90 minute respawn time?<br>

In my experience around Crushbone/GFay Area, basically Melees have a better chance of survival if not pvp success.  So far these posts have neglected the fact that, at least in my experience on Tallon, much of the pvp combat happens over flared tempers or just instantaneously.  Those that camp people out just to pk are a minority.  Consider this, in a quick skirmish near CB zone, a dwarf warrior attacks my twinked HE wizzy, or mutual suspision causes us to attack simultaneously.  He has the HPs to survive the skirmish even if I root/nuke.  He can simply zone once the root breaks, that is if it held in the first place.  Warriors, at least at low lvls have distinctive advantage in their naturally higher mr.  My roots are resisted around 60% of the time. Against twink melees I'm lucky if one ever sticks.  Not to mention the fizzles and resists and 66%nerf.  Even with an int of 168 and full manna starting, I would be hard pressed to kill a similar level warrior.  Once a melee starts pouding my wussy elf wizzy into the ground near a zone, Shadowstep does little to get me away in time to gate or run, provided I have enough manna.  Again I've no exp with High lvl pvp, but at low lvls melees have definate advantages in their chance for survival.<br>

I suspect I would have a slightly easier time on cable for example BUT I think the movement issue would still hold true.

I'm quite sure I've heard people with fast connections complain about the same issue.

Try this, walk up close, wand times 3 or whatever, duelist, attack, backstab. Doesnt take a second, and kills a caster.<br>

Generally its refered to as KITING!  You don't have to run away run in a circle if you like for 12 whole seconds to avoid a dmg disc.<br>
<br>
About pvp kills at high lvl, most occur when people try to fight back and lose, get snared blinded or rooted, get taken down by multiple people, or killed when fighting mobs.  In my experience this is very true of melees killing casters due to the melee range issue, and very true of casters killing melees due to the melees hp and the fact that we can run out of range faster than you can cast nukes.<br>
<br>
<br>
As a rule from what I've seen people that run early and hard rarely die even to gang bang squads supposing they can resist root and snare.  As I've explained before the average duelist round isn't enough to kill a standing caster and the melee range issue is enough to allow them to make a quick retreat without much chance of a finishing shot (unless they are snared) if they are badly injured. So get over it.<br>

<br>
My warrior has NEVER had problems hitting another player who was trying to run away, swerving or in a straight line.  I do have DSL, so that may be a factor.  I would truly hope that the people saying melee's can't hit moving targets don't just chase with autoattack on.  I really hope that's not the case.  When you're giving chase to someone, or hitting a moving target, you need to know how the game reacts to your connection and anticipate when to hit the poor fool running.<br>
<br>
I don't have experience with disc's, so no comment other than can't we just bugger off and wait the few minutes for the disc to wear off?  Disc's, Harmtouch take a lot of time to come back relative to the time it take for me to med back mana to nuke as a wizard.  The only difference is, I need to sit down and /sittingduck on.<br>
<br>
I also have a mid 20's sk on Sullon Zek (never played now because I'm a troll stuck in Toxx forest after getting spire ganked by lvl 40's.  har har), but I know how frustrating it is to wait for that HT to come back.  I feel like a god for about 5 minutes every 24 hours.  yipee.<br>
<br>
-----------------------<br>
<br>
I've said it before and I'll say it again, any class can get resist gear to make our wizard class almost completely resisted and useless.<br>
<br>
Where is the gear that cuts melee damage the 80percent that my nukes are cut?  Nerf is not the answer, melee resist gear, resist debuff gear is the answer.  Pre 50's the problem lies in an unbalance of gear in the game, but any gear that would help defend against melee that much, or debuff resists that much would make the PvE game silly.  Verant/Sony won't stand for mobs being made impotent.  Player wizards on the other hand...<br>

Something about moving. And yes it applies to both Caster's and Melee's, I believe you conceded this point (or proposed it).<br>
<br>
I find it interesting that your solution to avoiding a BS, /disc, wand, whatever.... is to always have the caster: A) Be aware of what is around you, B) Move when you see someone... Yet, when it comes to avoiding the nuke, why can't YOU A) Be aware of what is around you, B) Move when you see someone.<br>
<br>
I also find it amusing that you say /disc might not kill in one shot... Well, same with nukes. AND I might add, lets say your BS, /disc, whatever didn't kill me outright. Gosh I know sooo many wizards that like to stick around and fight at 2 bubbles or lower life after taking one round of that. Your shadow step/yonder theory has one flaw.... Random direction.... I really don't unserstand your complete and utter fear of nukes, YOU can at least survive a few, while as us fellow wizards can take far fewer, yet we don't complain. Most griefers are going after fellow wizards to ENSURE the kill outright and then claim how they are uber..<br>
<br>
For that fleeing character, use a bow for god's sake it is much easier. Yes it doesn't do as much damag as your epic, but some damage is better than none, and it keeps them moving for fear of you being to close to stop and cast... Fleeing wizards can't cast spells, and taking damage doesn't engender us to stop and cast.....<br>

<br>
Thats never true save for twinking.<br>
<br>
As far as hitting a moving target of course you don't run with auto attack on.  Id suggest you test again at sow/jboots speed.<br>
<br>
Next to Kainit's post insightful as always.<br>
<br>
Well man I think you should be able to realize nukes are a bit different than melee dmg.  While its not hard to avoid sitting around scratching your ass while an enemy calmly walks up behind you and wastes your ass.  You can't avoid all nukes as easily.<br>
<br>
The point is this.  In the course of pvping a wizard who doesn't suck you will have to eat some nukes win or lose because of channeling, shadowstepping, evasive movement, ghosting, or exploiting. but you never ever ever have to eat a sitting duelist bs (the only case where it is as powerful as you seem to think).  If you ever do you can blame nobody but yourself because the neccesary precations are so simple.  Keep see invis up.  If an enemy rogue walks up to you, stand up! Hard huh?  In addition you never have to take more than 1 round of duelist dmg if you play smartly.  Moving around for the duration of the disc really will work 100% of the time.<br>
<br>
I'll say this again.  Moving for a caster is what you do near the whole fight. Its called kiting.  Moving to avoid nukes only has 3 places...<br>
<br>
Running<br>
<br>
Backing off when you don't know where the caster is casting from.<br>
<br>
Avoiding nukes before you can close with the caster.<br>
<br>
For the most part you will be trying to stay as close as possible and interupt.  Moving is only an option when your allready near max distance and have no hope of interupting.<br>
<br>
If you want to fight at all you will have to get in close and take your lumps.  Of course this is true for the caster as well they do have to take some dmg but not disc dmg!<br>
<br>
If I'm not mistaken with epic and decent gear you shouldn't have a terrible time getting to 1400hp + 800 rune or 2200 hp of dmg absorption. Since 70% of duelist rounds will be 800 or lower (possibly much lower) thats hardly an instant kill.  In fact its just enough to take down your skin.  Even most of the 30% remaining will only be in the low 1000+ range.<br>
<br>
In addition properly executing this round takes timing not a hotkey press like HT.  You can avoid the initial bs if your skillful.<br>
<br>
What makes a strategy overpowered isn't the raw power possible but the lack of counterstrategies.  Nuking is very powerful.  It can kill a player in a matter of seconds BUT it has counters does it not? Interupting and moving when you can't interupt.  Melee dmg similarly has limitations.  More of them and more and better counters in fact.<br>
<br>
Counters for Duelist.  Don't sit without paying attention and stand up if an enemy rogue comes near.<br>
<br>
Don't stand still after a rogue has triggered duelist.<br>
<br>
Don't expose your back.<br>
<br>
Keep moving.<br>
<br>
Don't remain in a fight where your skin is gone and your hp low unless you are really realy close to winning.<br>
<br>
Stop and start to try to get the rogue to waste duelist for 0 or nearly 0 dmg.<br>
<br>
Even if it does hit as stated above its hardly a mannaburn.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now lets look at mannaburn. What can yo do.  Well if you get ambushed like the sitting wiz your dead but your foe can be 200 feet away behind a wall or around a corner.  You may well never see it comming.<br>
<br>
You can move to avoid mannaburning but the skill wont be wasted and if you want to do ANY dmg you must close with the caster thus forgeting about avoiding for the sake of intrupting.<br>
<br>
Then if your talking about interupting you have to remember your dealing with an uber spell clasified as a lvl 1 spell making it easier to channel AND the recall the focus items that are going in.<br>
<br>
Then you have to remember that all you have to do to ghost is run up and down a wall and that the slightest bit of lag could grant you a free nuke and the win easily enough.<br>
<br>
MB unlike duelist is an instant kill, it gets cast...you drop dead.  Even if its not going your way your free to exodus or nexus gate in 1/10 of a second pfff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufrosthoundsz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FrosthoundSZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/6/02 4:46:08 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~scoventon/EQ/fh.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Interesting....</span><hr size=1> All you have to do to get away from a melee is strafe and run up a hill.  Some Wizards are nearly impossible to kill because they know how to move.  Other Wizards die in a couple rounds because they don't know how to move.<br>
<br>
When I play my wizard, killing just seems too easy.  Lures take no skill to land save clicking your hotkey.  They do large chunks of damage reliably, without having to time it, or stick on someone like glue.  You just sit back, push the '1' key, and giggle to yourself as you remove a big chuck of hp.  I'm not saying playing a wizard doesn't take skill, but the skill is all in not getting hit.<br>
<br>
Just because you don't have the mana pool to kill a Warrior solo, doesn't mean lures aren't nasty in PvP.  PvP isn't about being able to sneak up and gank everybody one on one.  You run around with a group.<br>
<br>
Manaburn is an unresistable, instant kill.  I'm sure the idea of having an auto-kill ability is appealing to some of you, but it's overpowered, and you had better expect a nerf soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27>PVP Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.6<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
