If you have the timing down on his spawn (12 to 14 hour repop), than you can aim for your raid to hit kedge at around 13 hours after the last kill and usually beat any other competitors.<br>
<br>
If you run into a situation where another raid makes it to phinny before your raid force is assembled than you should congratulate the other raid leader for getting assembled before you did and call your raid off and try to negotiate a drop or two for your friends.  This will save you and your friends much aggravation.  <br>
<br>
The phinney camp is a long haul for a wizard (14 times and around 2 months) and from your post it sounded like you were monopolizing the spawn (i.e. you killed phinney 12 hours before).  In my opinion you can't expect to win the competition for phinney every time and you know that you have lost the competition when another raid hits the kedge zone fully formed while you are still waiting for more people to show up.<br>

<br>
Now as for who's got dibs, officially you probably won't get a ruling on this, not in writing that's for sure.  But precedent *has* been set by the Lead GM on my server, and that's &quot;first group there WITH enough to kill him gets the spawn&quot;, this has been applied to things like the EJ dragon, etc..<br>
<br>
the &quot;WITH enough&quot; part escapes a lot of people... sorry you don't camp a lvl 20 druid at the zone line and claim anything for 2 hours..<br>

<br>
Okay, before anyone says anything, I move my raid party to the ledge of his lair.  I do have to say to the person I can't get all of his spawns, but I can try.  <br>
<br>
Anyway the same guild, came in in and started pulling, I tried to hail them, sent people tells, etc, to no use, to be honest  I did not think we we were ready, but I called for our puller to pull and off he went.  The next thing we know we have 4 sawhorses and phinnney on the ledge.  I had already targeted Phinney long  before he got there, and once he was there flux him, and started nuking. <br>
<br>
What it turned into was a huge train, I told my people to focus in Phinney, once the other guild realized this I had already been summoned 6 times, out to the 12 times I was summoned by phinney this go around.  I only had 9 people there, but just what I needed, since I don't have access to lvl 60 people.  All but 2 of my people were lvl 52, the the other two 57 and 59.  <br>
<br>
Anyway my group was 3 lvl 52s.  WE took the kill. And I actually killed Phinney.  I had my cleric camp with the train they pulled, and I was the main assist.  Yes I know I wizards should not tank.  <br>
<br>
Well my group of 3 took Phinney, yes there were 4 seahorses there, however we had not engaged them, the other group was still there.  As soon as they realized that phinney was dead, and they did not get the kill, they evaced and left us with thier train<br>
<br>
Well, I looted Phinney, dropped the BCS, amoung other drops, and called for an evac as I had already had our cleric camp, and knowing our druid was LOM after they left us with thier train<br>
<br>
Before I called for the evac, I had only lost one person to phinney ( the first person I have lost to him).  Now that they left us with thier train, my people did thier jobs, knowing I had laready had the cleric camp out, and continued to fight so the evacer in each group could evac. They both went down, but everyone else was evaced.<br>
<br>
Then Pia Fideles or whatever the hell they are called called fauled and petitioned that they were KS'ed.  All kind of threats came to me after from thier guild members.<br>
<br>
<br>
Two questions come to mind, more then that, I was the only person Phinney was summoning. I nuked him 15 times with Drought of Fire.  Now how does even with a wizard a group of 3 people, all lvl 52.  KS 12 people in 2 groups of 55  mostlly 60s?  And why would they petition sinceed they evaced out?<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, I had to talk to the senior guide.  The issue is still open as far as I know till review of the logs.<br>

PS this is the same guild that sniped me when we wereee setting up at the entrance to Kedge.  I learned. <br>
<br>
PSS This guild has now told me they will not help me again.  Though I am little confused as I never ask for thier help, then again, maybe it has something to do with the fact I would not port them from CS to whereever last night, and those people were KOS their and died right in front of me.<br>

<br>
On the other hand, Phinny's a linked spawn. The main reason you clear the swirlspines out before you pull, is that when you pull you're going to get it all.<br>
<br>
I've actually verified this in one phinny camp, when the raid leader asked me to stand up ... and I did. Basically, we had a Guardian on the ledge sitting on the corpses from the first attempt. They were doing res and CR, and the raid leader asked me to stand up to re-aggro the Guardian if he started to leave (I'd managed to feign during the wipeout, and by the time the CR was going had mended up to healthy).<br>
<br>
Well, they were about halfway done CR, the Guardian started to leave. I sent out a warning OOC, stood up. Guardian came for me. Phinny came for me. Four swirlspines came for me. I squeaked. Feigned. Got hit by the slow-casting Wrath one of the swirlies put on me, feign broken, exceedingly dead monk.<br>
<br>
But basically, you win the whole room if you aggro Phinny and anything's up, was my experience. So your train may not have been a train per se, but just you pulling Phin while they were engaging the swirlspines (and then Phin sharing hate with the swirlspines, and you getting The Big Win summons again and again). You're lucky the adds didn't CH the punk repeatedly, it's happened to me before.<br>
<br>
And I'm REAL glad you got your staff, but I fear for you in the review. VI's twisted and loves to stick to the letter of the law. By that, you leapfrogged them, I think, from your account. They moved past your group (which wasn't engaged, but was in a position to engage). This is where you might win. If you don't, though, and their first to engage the first seahorse... you leapfrogged by the same set of rules. Since they were busy with guards you had to clear, and you went for the lootholder (Phinny), they might decide YOU broke the policy, even though the other guild screwed you in the first place.<br>
<br>
Good luck though. I hate seeing the asses win, and I hope they don't in your case.<br>
