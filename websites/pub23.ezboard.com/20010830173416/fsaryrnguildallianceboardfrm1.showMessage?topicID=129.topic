<br>
I have been on nine planes raids so far. For all that time I have gotten no net experience, no net cash, and one nice item. For less playing time in Karnors I have gained two levels, lots of plat, and many items including; Springwood club, two Kunzar cloaks, Sionachies Partisan, Singing Steel Boots, ?? bracer (ac3 int5 wis5 str5 magic5?), a mask (ac6 str5), Druid arms (cast Drones of Doom), and several other things. To go to Hate or Fear you need to schedule a time and day way in advance and then pull teeth to get enough people to show up (especially clerics and chanters). In Karnors you just walk in and ooc for a group. In the planes there is a real risk of losing all the stuff on your corpse. In Karnors this is possible if you go into the basement or well, but not likely. For a planes raid usually an hour or two is taken before the first mob is killed. In Karnors it is about 10 minutes before the slaying commences.<br>
So which sounds better to you the Planes or Karnors?<br>
<br>
I am sure there are many more dungeons were the experience, cash, and the items are better then the planes; so why do we try going to the planes anymore. At first the planes were design for level 46 to 50, and were tough but doable. Then the level for PCs were raised and the planes were toughened, but were fesible for parties that had many low to mid 50s in them. Now they buffed the planes up again, it looks like maybe a party with an average level of 55 or so is needed. So do we continue to go to Hate and Fear or do we wait until we all have gained a few levels?<br>
<br>
I am not trying to tell SGA what to do, only trying to get everyone to rethink our priorities as far as raids go. Perhaps the discussion from this thread result in a change in our focus, perhaps not. But I do feel we need to think and talk this out.<br>

I have indicolite boots to show for it so far. The big problem today was one of information. <br>
<br>
A bunch of us had heard and read that the SW corner where we normally set camp was trapped and hence unusadble. We found that not to be the case from the CR camp and me asking H and E about it. I agree it's a pain to get planes raids organized, you got to have commitment from major key classes to do them and frankly yes sometimes the armor drops and sometimes it doesn't. <br>
<br>
I think VI did buff the planes to give the 55 plus guys yet another thing to do with their time and made planes armor that much harder to get. Resist wise planes armor rocks, for us tanks but we can get close if not better AC from icewell or the quests in Thurgdain or Kael.<br>
<br>
I agree with you though that we should be better prepaired to even attempt hate again. Most of our members have Fear experience and to be honest Hate is harder to get in and CR from not to mention pulling. I have no problem with setting our sights a little lower and getting the guilds to work cohesively first before going back. Along those lines though I still maintain that we should set up gear camps to better outfit the members and try to bring the greatest benefit to the membership in order to prepare ourselves.<br>

<br>
If we as SGA cannot do the planes, we cannot do most of the zones in the game that 50+ people do. <br>
<br>
There is no predetermined goal in EQ. There is no boss mob that you beat and then see the credits scroll by. VI has left it up to you as the player to determine what the 'goal' of EQ is. Some people roleplay and never break level 30 and probably have more fun than I do in this game. Some people are lewt doods, some are xp hogs, some are perpetual newbies with all 8 character slots filled on 4 different servers none over 20th.<br>
<br>
So this is a question about goals or motives. My goal? To do some of the toughest zones in this game with my friends.<br>
<br>
It is no coincidence that this is what I wrote into the SGA charter when I was drafting it. It is no coincidence that I belong to SG whose make up is a strong group of friends.<br>
<br>
I am not in this for the loot my friends. I do not go to the planes only to loot Indo. I go to the planes to DO the planes. You spend all this time building your character, collecting gear to make you more efficient in battle, learning tactics... all for what? To DO the tough zones IMO, not to camp single xp spawns and get a blue bub of xp in 8 hours. <br>
<br>
So yes.. the planes are worth it to ME. I will do CR every Saturday and Sunday for 10 hours until SGA can do them. I will continue to do CR for 10 hours every raid until we can move into tougher zones than the planes. Why? Because I want to DO these zones with you guys. That is what makes EQ fun for me. Do I want full Indo? Of course... to me it is more of a status symbol... there goes Bamil in full Indo, he is in SGA, I wish I belonged to an organization like that, plus how sexy would I be in all brown? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Being 44 I still have some time before worrying about them--but--I do have to say, seeing the role of a 44 (maybe it's better at higher levels) bard in multi-party raid situations...<br>
<br>
The planes may be fun...but for Vainne, if they are like the Hole and CoM and Kael and Vox, my strength is only as a support class. Important yes--fun to do for 10 hours straight...um...well.../e massages her aching wrist and curses Verant for giving bards 2 mana songs that stack :P.<br>
<br>
Most challenging &quot;raids&quot; for me are single party experiences fighting mobs my own levl-ish without an enchanter, or without a cleric...or without soime other class where there is a gap I can fill, and we as a group, just kinda rock.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the best approach to the planes would be the armour issues? That and developing friendships and a sense of community, which during those ten-hour cr's, we will have time to do. <p><b> ~The Nightblind Bard~

I feel that SGA need to be able to dominate a lesser plane(with the exception of gods) inorder to advance to the more difficult zones like PoG/Dragon's Necropolis.. etc.  Large scale sustained raids builds teamwork given time.  Having 30+ people in close quarters working together killing multiple tough mobs for hours and hours is important for us to successful hunt in the harder zones in the game.  This might take a while though cuz we still have a large # of members in the SGA who are close to being planar ready and have little or no planar experience.  Basically, I guess we'll have keep practicing large scale raid tactics until almost everyone have become more experienced and accustomed to such situations. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showMessage?topicID=140.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showMessage?topicID=143.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=129.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=129.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.threadControl?topicID=129.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=129.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=129.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm1">General Discussion<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm8">Guild Links<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm4">Alliance Events<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm2">Guild Member Introductions<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm5">Alliance Marketplace<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm7">Officer forum<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm6">Guild Leader discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bsaryrnguildallianceboard>saryrnguildallianceboard</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href=http://www.entercasino.com/main.cgi?refererID=502600>What's your game?
