While pets are subject to the 66% nerf melees must deal with the melee range issue.  Basicly it goes like this.  Players in motion (especialy at jboots, aa run, or sow speed) are impossible to hit till they stop, run past you (as with 2 people jousting eachother) or turn a predictable corner you can cut to get a hit in.<br>
<br>
Since casters will spend most of a fight in motion you might put this at a 80-90% dmg reduction vs unsnared oponents.<br>
<br>
In addition although many casters use commandable pets I would only term one from experience as weak in pvp.  That would be mages.  Removing the 2/3 dmg nerf on pets to help that one class would be silly especially since the desired effect wouldn't occur.  Mages pets would still be weak vs classes that can root, snare or blind them.  Mages pets would still be strong vs classes that cannot and even more so than before.<br>
<br>
On the subject of &quot;fixing&quot; archery, melee dmg and such before fixing mannaburn. Get real.  Melee vs caster balance is a complicated issue.  Mannaburn isn't.  It shouldn't under any circumstances be allowed in pvp.  Removing it is a simple matter of opening up the database and making it non pvp usable much like fear and charm.<br>
<br>
Deal with the simple shit thats messing up pvp first then worry about the hard stuff.<br>
<br>
On a final note I think that saying a wiz must cast 4 times per landed lure is inaccurate. First this doesn't take into acount free hits from first strikes and when leved.  Nor does it take into acount hits when you lose the melee for a moment and get a nuke. Nor the ease in creating a hill bug then nuking.<br>
<br>
Nor do I believe that 25% figure to be accurate in the slightest if you know what your doing.  What do I base this on?  I base it on the ease of a mage casting scars of sigil while being meleed 100% of the time. Thats a 2 second cast...<br>
<br>
How about you provide some proof. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uchifiir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chifiir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/12/02 8:53:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> haha</span><hr size=1> Aerimus, look at this.<br>

If that melee catches you, it's first a bash, then a couple whacks.  Then a couple whacks.  IF you live, you can try to get away, but they're the same speed.  There's  NO WAY (without a distance SS or hillbug) to get away.  IF you do get away, they have a number of seconds to reengage before you can get the spell off.  You DO realize that level 60 tanks have 3-4-5k hps, right?  ~480 damage from a lure is NOTHING to them.  They're USED TO TAKING 400+ quads+flurry.  They have the hitpoints to do it, too.<br>
<br>
You DO realize we have jack for hitpoints, right?  Melee + tantor's tusk chasing us = bad.  If you close, they swap weapons to fast 1handers and shred you while you pray pray pray for a channel.<br>
<br>
Melees OWN casters.  Figure it out.  This is 100% because of the gear in the game.<br>

60 wizards can kill 60 melees in sub-par gear. <br>

The difficulty of channeling a spell depends on the level. I have run extensive testing, it's somewhere on the main www.graffe.com board, I don't feel like diging the post up again, but I can look around on my disc to see if I saved it.<br>
<br>
What I showed in my testing is that at level 60, channeling a spell with same casting time (a draught = 3.0 secs) depends not only on the duration but on the level of the spell. You have much lower chance of channeling the level 57 draught than the level 51 draught. That's why I was pointing out that using the 519 dmg lure is harder. If you want to risk less then you can use the level 52 lure, it will be channelled more, but that was simply the figures I put out channeling a level 60 spell with ~ 2 seconds in melee.<br>
<br>
As far as I am concerned, I am not one of those that compares wizards to rogues damage wise, and in PvP although a rogue is deadly, I am much more afraid of warriors with stun kick, or monks with mend. My vision of PvP is that quite a lot of people do shitloads of damage, or are able to, and the problem is that some classes can soak up damage (like warriors) and others can't. Rogues with their low hitpoints are scared because of that.<br>
<br>
For 1 on 1 pvp to be fair, you need to be able to take on any class and win. What happens is that in fact the person with the 'worst' class simply runs away. Manaburn is wrong in so far as if you sneakily open up with it, you can kill a person without her even knowing that you are there. While there are ways to prevent this (such as doing /who quite often and knowing your ennemy) I agree it is overpowered. But please tell me why my only viable option against a monk who knows his shit is to run? Or use 'hill exploits'. Is it not normal that if a caster is in melee with a melee class that she loses, and that if a melee is at range vs a caster class that the melee loses? If you think melee should have an advantage in close combat AND in long range combat, then this discussion is over because you don't seek balance, you simply seek melees to have an advatage everywhere.<br>
<br>
FYI unbuffed I have 1200 HPs. I don't have NTOV gear. I read here and there that rogues do about 100 dps. That means you can kill me in about 12secs melee. And don't factor in the fact that I am running, if I am running I can't cast, I'm not a bard. Furthermore, while I am running you have the opportunity to hit me from time to time. If I don't stop I have 0 change of doing any damage. (ok maybe I have 0.0000001% chance if I try to channel while running back at same spot) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/13/02 7:11:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: haha</span><hr size=1> 100dps unbuffed pfff no way. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/14/02 5:40:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: haha</span><hr size=1> /<br>

/<br>
<br>
The numbers you used for mb was buffed and with ntov gear, so its fair to asume you got the same as well.<br>
Aslo, a ntov equiped wizard doing mb against an ntov equiped rogue doesnt mean automatic kill. The damage is somewhat random.<br>

<br>
So if you are standing still unbuffed doing nothing a wizard can kill you in 18 seconds (actualy not exactly true as spell gem refesh has to be worked around adding a bit of time, else the time would be 24seconds).Can you kill an unbuffed wizard standing still doing nothing within 18 seconds?<br>
You may use duelist as well (its balanced after all, right?) , althou I dont think its exactly needed.<br>

You reading skills need improvement. The suggestions have been EITHER (look it up in a dictionary) remove the 66% spell nerf or nerf melee damage 2/3.<br>

<br>
Same thing here, EITHER keep mb or else remove all similar skills (like duelist).<br>
<br>
What you want is to keep any inbalances that is favorable to youself, but remove those that is bad for you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/14/02 8:04:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: haha</span><hr size=1> Ok so what's your DPS?

Duels are not real pvp.<br>

Pvp vs uber equiped people isn't the same as the average player.<br>
<br>
I'd like some info.  First what kind of manna does the average lvl 60 wizard have with only self buffs.  Next whats the breakdown of what mannaburn does.  Example 40% of the time mannaburn does x times base manna pve, 40% of the time it does y dmg, 20% of the time you get lucky and it does z dmg.<br>
<br>
I'm betting that vs a rogue its always an insta kill.<br>
<br>
I don't have duelist yet but while it will be more powerful than previous discs its not a matter of hitting one button and getting a kill 100% of the time.  It will suffer the limitations of all melee dmg.<br>
<br>
Have you seen endless bitching about duelist across many boards? No why? People know how to deal with it.  The only time I hear it mentioned is in response to so caster bs like mannaburn. /point but but you have duelist is pretty much how it goes.

Then there is the fact that if the melee has no wands to use and no lev you can kite him forever because you can protect your buffs with jboots + any other insta cast item and you'll be pretty much immune to melee dmg.<br>
<br>
Then you have to add your skin spell, which will either take time to pumice off or time to wear through.<br>
<br>
If he golem wands you outdoors yonder off and rebuff.  He'll have to fight you without golem wands shortly.  He can't burn that pp forever.<br>
<br>
I would tend to think that with thurg quest and similar quality gear with ac hp mr pr gear you could get to 2000 hp counting mannaskin at mid 50s easily. <br>
<br>
For fighting a rogue I would point out that you only need about 1300 manna.  You also only need to maintain 90pr for an even con and hopefully 100 mr as a just in case sort of thing.  I suggest after that is atained all gear you equip go to increasing ac and hp as those are the only things that will matter in the fight.<br>
<br>
I think that outdoors its very viable for you to force a rogue into a losing position.  This often wont result in death for the rogue as they can flee but then you can yonder, gate, or zone many times too.<br>
<br>
Indoors its another matter.  If you get attacked by a rogue indoors I recommend you gate.  If you initiate the attack chances are your gonna either exploit los or lose.  I suggest indead hitting the rogue with one nuke zoning out and fighting him outdoors if he follows.<br>

----------------------------------------------------------<br>
I'm betting that vs a rogue its always an insta kill.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
What are you betting?<br>
Should be an interesting way to earn some quick cash there.<br>
<br>
Q:<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
I don't have duelist yet but while it will be more powerful than previous discs its not a matter of hitting one button and getting a kill 100% of the time. <br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
True, its only a bit above 90% instant kill, althou the disc lasts so with follow ups those that get away is fairly few.<br>
Average damage for one round of duelist is around 2k against a caster, much less against a melee due to higher ac and skills like dodge/parry/riposte. Neglecting to use golem wand increases the chances to maybe 50% survival of one round of melee.<br>
<br>
Q:<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Have you seen endless bitching about duelist across many boards? No why? People know how to deal with it. The only time I hear it mentioned is in response to so caster bs like mannaburn. /point but but you have duelist is pretty much how it goes. Get real.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Interesting logic there, I whine more then you do, so I must be right. Its also not talked about that much anymore as most people are in agreement. Problem is that removing discs (and mb/lb) for pvp would remove some of the flashy things that can be done.<br>
<br>
<br>
As a side note so might the upcoming caster rebalance make the 66% rule more sensible in the future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27>PVP Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.5.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
