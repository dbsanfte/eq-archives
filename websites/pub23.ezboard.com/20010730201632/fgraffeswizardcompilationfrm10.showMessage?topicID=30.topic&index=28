You say fizzle rate isnt determine by lvl but by alter skill..umm how the hell you think you get high alter skill,by LVL.<br>

This is directly from GZ's old Archmage column on the EQ board, I edited it to refer to Wizards specifically:<br>
<br>
There is always a 5% chance of succeeding (regardless of how low your appropriate skill is) and a 5% chance of failure (regardless of how high your appropriate skill is). What modifies the chance to fizzle check is the appropriate skill (Abjuration, Evocation, etc.), your Wizard's Intelligence, the difficulty of the spell, and the level of the spell. Spells have a toughness rating, so that some are less difficult to cast than others. According to GZ, none are more difficult than the average to cast.<br>
<br>
When you gain a new rank of spells, any spell that you cast of that rank has a 20% chance of fizzling. This is adjusted by your skill and INT, and the toughness rating of the spell. If your INT is greater then 75 the chance of fizzle is reduced by 1% for every point of your statistic above 75. Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the spell). A Wizard getting Bind Affinity (a Wizard gets 4th rank spells at level 12, so 5 * 12 =60) would have that spell assuming that he had a 60 Alteration skill for purposes of casting. With a 60 skill in Alteration (the appropriate skill) and a 75 intelligence, our wizard would have an 80% chance of successfully casting Bind Affinity. For every skill point that our Wizard has above 60, the percent chance of fizzling goes down by 1%, to a minimum of a 5% chance of fizzling.<br>
<br>
Thus, three levels (15 skill points) after our Wizard gets Bind Affinity, he will be able to max out Alteration for that spell, and have a mere 5% chance of fizzling the spell. Higher Intelligence will also help with this.<br>
<br>
This explains why when you first get spells you will see more fizzles with that spell. It also notes why it is important to have a higher INT, not just for mana, and why it is good to practice your skills up before you head out into the cruel world to try them out.<br>
<br>
=====================================================================<br>
<br>
As you can see, your rate of fizzling is no higher by the time you get even halfway through the level you got a spell than it will be 10 levels later.  Getting the spell at level 50 to stop fizzles is a false rumor.<br>
<br>

<br>
Roots do NOT work.  When I hit lvl 16 I could not root a snake.  I got Enstill, which is either resisted or does NOT stick on 90% of mobs cast upon.  Bonds of Force... everyone told me I would love this spell... I DON'T.  It is resisted by gnolls in Qeynos!  I'm not talking about fizzles here, I am talking about flat out NOT WORKING!  When I notified a GM I was informed that the root line of spells had been nerfed for Wizards to &quot;balance&quot; the classes.  If a mage can have his pet root a mob and have it stick, why cant I do the same?  <br>
<br>
I cannot solo because I cannot root and cast.  Everyone says kite.  Fine idea if the spells sticks, certain death if it doesnt and you dont know if it's going to stick when you cast it.  The GMs have told me that VI is more interested in grouping and learning to work together than the solo Wizzie running around getting XP.  That's pure BS.  If a mage can solo why can't I?  That's truly the question.  If a warrior can solo, why not a wizzie?<br>
<br>
Fizzles are not bad if you truly practice and cast all types of spells.  I suck at divination, but Evocation and Abjuration are through the roof because Im always shielding myself then nuking something.  I put in practice points where I can.  Being a high elf I do not cast the sight spells since I see well enough, thank you very much.  So I'm penalized for my race.  (I'm not going to get started on my theory that VI only wants high level Erudite Wizards)<br>
<br>
I usually only fizzle at the beginning a new level and then those are few and far between.  Give me something that will work... PLEASE! <p>Severine <BR>

<br>
Concussion was said to be level 39 because it helps regaining concentration when you cast a spell at least 10 levels below your current level, not because of fizzles. This is obviously important for a spell like concussion, which is meant to be cast when you're being beaten on.<br>
<br>
Root cannot/will not be strengthened because it might make tanking redundant at some levels. Why bother having tanks if you can just root mobs reliably out of melee range and nuke/dot/shoot them to bits?<br>
<br>
The Skyfire port is hardly suicidal. I've used it many times, only been aggroed about 3 of those times, and never even came close to dying. <p>Darth Eldritch<BR>

As far as I am concerned if you die even 10% of the time from wandering death, that isn't an evac, its a port that might leave people behind.  Nobody would make an evac to somewhere lethal like that (and don't tell me all they could make is an evac... the evacs come AFTER the personal and group ports, they are more complex).<br>
<br>
You have to remember something.  What level is this spell?  What level are the monsters that use that area as a crossroads?  Evacs are supposed to get you OUT of danger, that's why there isn't a Cazic Thule evac.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Concussion was said to be level 39 because it helps regaining concentration when you cast a spell at least 10 levels below your current level, not because of fizzles. This is obviously important for a spell like concussion, which is meant to be cast when you're being beaten on.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Another interesting rumor, but channelling gives you a chance to recover to cast A spell, not specific spells.  Regaining concentration is only based on channeling, the skill, no other factors.  The reason you can tend to cast lower level spells with channeling at higher level is because.... they are quicker in the past than your most recent spells until level 51.<br>
<br>
Sorry, that isn't the reason either.  You want to know the reason, from GZ, what Verant actually said, not rumors and speculation?<br>
<br>
&quot;Just because a spell is at a given level doesn't mean it is supposed to be used then.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm serious, those are his exact words.  And that, my fellow Wizards, is no reason at all. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A> at: 1/7/01 8:08:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uruinesunfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ruine Sunfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/7/01 10:39:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> beating a dead horse.</span><hr size=1> this is just my own opinion but<br>
<br>
Alkabor spells. They are trash, VI know they are trash, Vi likes them as trash, if they didn't they would've been changed. I don't use, mem, and is some cases even sribe these spells.<br>
<br>
Rain spells. Someone said these have been broken since release. And both players and Vi know this. This is just a total mystrey to me, Why would somthing like this stay unfixed for years? they are fun to use on single mobs with no pets and in open spaces, but so far that's about it.<br>
<br>
Roots.  root is unreilable, yes. but at it's lvl it is useful. Enstill is dog trash, and so is paralizying earth. I have yet to use Fetter so i can't comment, but so far Immbolize is the best root. It's quick and always regains casting, except against mobs below lvl 10. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Velious has made it a bit Mmore unreiable that before.<br>
