It is just a poorly conceived and implemented content that allows the earliest to a zone to get the best items, and those that struggle and lag behind to miss out. <br>
<br>
This should have opened a new, better zone, or released stronger, better treasure critters in ST, imo... but alas, it is just a zone to work to get into, so that you can farm it first, and the ruin it for others... lame.<br>

Kinda disappointing though how this encounter was used as a form of revenge, and at the expense of other guilds not involved in this feud.<br>
<br>
But it's REALLY gay how so many people who had nothing to do with Sleepers Tomb, and wouldn't for some time to come, jumped up in arms about this.  Everyone across the server had expected him to die soon; hell, we are Xegony, most of us are assholes, someone was bound to do it just because they could.  I just wish people could shut up for more than 5 minutes between every /ooc, /shout, /gui (not like we're anywhere near ST... couple have keys but we didn't get the keys for them), or message to the buysell channel about the sleeper.

I've never seen a mob not in the game get so much attention.

Because Primal, which 95% of these people had NO hope of getting, will drop less often and off of easier mobs.  Because someone did what was accepted as the inevitable, and somehow had been put off for longer than most other servers, and finally woke that stupid fucking pink dragon that I have grown to hate.<br>

It's not like waking up the sleeper effects 50% of the zones in the game, it only effects ONE zone in the game. Learn to live with it.<br>

<br>
TMC and IC used to be very closely tied together.  TMC was originally a GM guild.  GMs from other servers created and ran the guild, until someone eventually got in trouble and they went underground for a while.  Some TMC members joined IC from what I understand.  Well recently the guild came back and in the meantime relations between the two groups soured for some reason I'm not privy to and really don't care to know about.<br>
<br>
Two days back IC and TMC had a staredown over the AC burrower.  As per the norm, IC won the staredown and took the burrower.  Later on, one of IC's more belligerent and charismatic leaders, a guy named Bakk, motivated his guild to take down the first warder to punish TMC, since they were just starting to farm ST.<br>
<br>
The reasoning here is pretty easy.  You can get primal weapons off of golems in ST, but the warders each dropped a bunch, guaranteed, every time they were killed.  Pulling a number directly from my behind, getting primal gear for your guild ups your dps by 20% or more, making encounters like AoW and other similar mobs much more feasible.<br>
<br>
There are 3 'big' guilds on Xegony; IC, my guild Havenlight, and the IS/VS/SOA consortium everyone calls Xegony Alliance 2 (XA2).  Lately, a few second tier guilds have become powerful enough to tackle encounters that previously the Big 3 squabbled over.  IC made a very calculated and tactical decision to slow these second tier guilds down in their advancement, keeping them from breathing down other guilds' necks on bigger game.<br>
<br>
I'd be a hypocrite if I said I was totally against this.  In fact, I'd suggested several times myself that HL release the sleeper.  We were the first guild to take down Warder 4 on our server, so we did feel a sense of entitlement.  But we were split 50-50, with a bunch of people not wanting to score the bad rep releasing him would cause.<br>
<br>
But recognize something.  People have actually been farming SoDs on Xegony for cash.  Player auctions right now has an SoD going for $1,250 in real money.  Imagine how things would get once three or four second tier guilds have the capacity to get SoDs, bumping up against the ebay farmers.  Talk about a riot ready to happen.<br>
<br>
So I'm torn a bit.  I truly feel bad for some of my friends in Jade Dragon, Undaunted, for some of HL's newer members and the like who won't be able to challenge themselves against the warders.  I'm sure they're just like I was; I could have cared less about the loot, I went there for the challenge of measuring myself against the warders.  I also feel a tiny bit bad that warders are off the table for a raid destination, even though we haven't been to ST for months.  But from a guild perspective it made logical sense for IC to do what they did.  Using the AC burrower incident as a catalyst is kind of lame, but the end result is something that probably needed to happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaidonrufflefuzz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aidon Rufflefuzz</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/23/02 7:05:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1153.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.engtong.com/Valoran/images/60x60/aidon60x60.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ST</span><hr size=1> On Karana, there is an agreement in place on the Council of Guilds to keep the 1st warder perma-alive.

<br>
Cut and pasted my input on that thread below in response to people saying waking Sleeper serves no purpose.<br>
<br>
The reasoning behind releasing the Sleeper was to halt up and coming guilds total damage-output by denying them SoDs - which allows all of your guild to increase their dps due to the warrior aggro-curve being much steeper - and of course primals which in Velious played a huge part, I've seen numbers ranging from 10-20% damage increase from the added ATK.<br>
<br>
I'm willing to bet that this is the reasoning behind releasing him on 9 out of 10 servers once the effects were known after BoTS released him serverwide first.<br>
<br>
With Luclin out and the easy access to good taunting weapons - at least better than ToVN and very close to the SoDs effectiveness, this reasoning doesn't really hold true anymore and guilds loose the incentive to release the sleeper because it does makes them look bad too, and it doesn't really have the server-altering effect it did before Luclin.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just cynical, but I'm very sure this was the reasoning behind releasing him on Tribunal, and if our competing alliance of guilds hadn't released him, I'm sure we would have considered it once up and coming guilds were close to getting 20 people into ST.<br>
<br>
Releasing him does have its upsides for the server too, the servers top tier guilds (that has been in ST since warders) all but totally lost interest in First Brood dragons, letting the next tier of guilds have access to more dragon-loot and of course ST keys, letting them acquire some primal at a slower pace - if the warders had been there I'm sure there would have been more competition for ST keys on servers where he is awoken than there is now - so the pace may not be so much slower than it would have been. At least this is what happened on Tribunal .<br>

It's all about Greed.  And I highly commend those people on my server with out the Greed.  I want to join Jade Dragon because the Greed was to much,  in fact a dead guild that Graffe him self started called Solas, was biased on the whole fact of anti-Greed<br>
<br>
www.graffe.com/solas/<br>
<br>
I was in this guild for a long time, really what killed it was just that most of the players saw that our view was being crushed, too many people on our server promote Greed.  Now, IC Stands at the top of this list for me, and I won't have anything to do with them.. Yes, the sleeper would at some time have been awoken, the whole point behind the design of this game<br>
<br>
But to do it to stop other guilds from reaching the same level of end game they have is just %100 pure GREED.  So, all of that guild with a few exceptions have made my black list.  And TMC too.  They trained a Fear raid I was on to get a wizards epic, from that time Iv been watching them. But I still blame IC for this, this should have been choice of majority of the server, not just one large guild.   Once again waking the sleeper will always upset some people, but like Xegony nothing can be done with out some level of flare or controversy<br>
