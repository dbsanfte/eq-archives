&quot;This is such a common argument, and it is incredibly flawed. Have you ever heard of amendments? The constitution can be changed. It was intended to be changed.&quot;<br>
<br>
WHY does it need to be changed?<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
That is exactly the question I am suggesting you ask.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;Until it IS changed however, you are required and legally bound to work under what it says&quot;<br>
--------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I’m not sure who you think is not working under the constitution.  If gun control laws are put in place, the law (like any other law) can have it’s constitutionality challenged.  If the Supreme Court finds it is unconstitutional, then the law is removed.  But the people who created the law were not acting in any unconstitutional way.  That is exactly how our system is designed to work.<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;The reasons they put it in the constitution have not changed.&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I agree that the reasons they put it in the constitution have not changed.  But many people don’t understand what those reasons are.  The only reason it was included in the constitution was so that the people could revolt against the government if the government became oppressive.  That is the way that our country was founded, so that right was clearly seen as important.  It was NOT included so that you can protect yourself from other citizens.  That may be a use for guns, but it’s not why they put it in the constitution.<br>
<br>
I would argue that large guns (rifles, shotguns, etc) should be perfectly legal because these are the guns that would be desirable in a war (revolution).  Concealable guns (hand guns) are not what you would want in a war, they’re purpose is for individual encounters of citizens.<br>
<br>
You speak of the absolute truth of the constitution.  Show me where it says you have the right to bear ANY AND ALL arms.<br>

Yes the founding fathers, imo, were thinking of revolutionary militias when they wrote the second amendment.  I also really doubt that if they were alive today they would have any problem with handguns carried for personal protection against criminals.  Of course they could not forsee the future, but it seems clear to me that the wording here was left open-ended intentionally. <p>Luxum Aeturnum - Delharen D'Oloth<BR>

Of course, i agree with you %100.  My opinion on gun control is just that, an opinion.  I don't pretend to know that I am absolutely right.  However, some people try to end the debate by quoting the constitution and claiming that it is some absolute truth.<br>
<br>
My point is that the debate is a valid one.  Those who have said that Constitution is an absolute truth also putting their own spin on the words.  They just don't see that they are doing it.  But they are interpreting it a certain way.  That is why I asked to show me where it says &quot;Any and All arms.&quot;<br>
<br>
If people are going to make the assertion that the wording of the constitution is absolute and leaves no room for interpretation, they I would respond by giving them a stick, calling it a weapon, and saying &quot;There.  You have a stick.  Your right to bear arms has been satisfied.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=liquid>Liquid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/02 1:11:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh sheesh</span><hr size=1> ack.  hit &quot;add reply&quot; by accident before checking for spelling/grammar.  so forgive the incomplete sentences in the above post. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uraufaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raufaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/02 1:34:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=125>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh sheesh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> To the extent it _is_ true it was not a Christian god they all believed in.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Indeed.  But wait, the 1st Amendment can be interpreted as a simple requirement that everyone be allowed to practice religion freely without the establishment of a state religion.

Note Milosevich was overthrown recently proving that it can happen today.<br>
<br>
Even if your assertion WERE true that it would be impossible for the people to resist (not at all realistic if everyone had arms, our military just doesn't have the numbers these days and US troops especially don't like to shoot at their countrymen) then it makes very little sense to give up liberties, which, by your own assertion would be impossible to recover.<br>

MY position is that revoking the second amendment will be practically impossible to undo. Therefore there is a much stronger burden for somone wishing to do so to prove absolutely that this is necessary and further that the necessity will never change.<br>

I personally believe that people should have the right to own any gun they want because, frankly, it's possible to purchase anything if the price is right.  I reject your arguments, however, because I simply don't believe the authors of the Bill of Rights would agree that all guns are equal and necessary for the continuance of our freedoms.

<br>
I can categorically guarantee you that fighting unarmed gives me a better chance at surprising you than reaching for a gun. If you're approching close enough to take my wallet out of my hand, you're close enough for me to have you semi-conscious on the ground before you know what hit you. It's undisputable fact that people move faster when they're unencumbered, and that speed is an extremely important factor in surprising your opponent.<br>

Further, your use of the word &quot;vigilant&quot; provokes images of vigilante justice. Perhaps this is your intent, but you should also realize that vigilante justice is one of the main things that the gun control lobby is trying to prevent.<br>

<br>
I fail to see how that statement is any different from the statement &quot;all fags are evil and going to hell&quot;. It's not. So why impose a double standard? Is it just because the african people have more numbers and are a more powerful force to fight against? If you would defend the blacks against the above, you should do it for the right reasons: it is the product of uneducated and uninformed presuppositions based on stereotypes. Well, so, too, is the statement about homosexuals, and they're entitled to just as much defense from the general public.<br>

You're looking too hard to make your point, Aurianne.  The spirit of the 2nd Amendment is that the simple citizens of the U.S. should be armed in case they need to rise up against a tyrannical government.  It's unlikely that the founding fathers would insist that citizens only fight with the weapons that were available in the late 18th century.  The 2nd Amendment doesn't have the &quot;right to bear muskets&quot;.  The founding fathers knew that firearm technology would progress past muskets.  So it became the &quot;right to bear arms&quot;.  I think that the fathers wrote &quot;arms&quot; precisely because they meant the term to be flexible.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If the spirit of the 2nd Amendment is to provide for defense against a tyrannical government and that government has machine guns, then the citizenry should have machine guns too.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to address an unwritten bias (and a seemingly irrational one) in your posts, Aurianne.<br>
<br>
You seem unable to accept (or even countenance) the notion that a person might own a gun (or lots of guns or big machine-guns) and not have a desire to use it in a criminal manner.  Just because I buy a gun doesn't mean that I'm going to do something horrible with it.  If I buy a car, it doesn't mean that I'm going to get drunk and kill someone in an accident.  If I buy a car, it doesn't mean that I'm going to go on a cross-country road-trip from NY to LA.  <br>
<br>
I say this in the spirit of constructive criticism: your stance against liberal gun laws seems to be overwhelmed by emotion and irrationality.  It's based on a horrible perception of human nature that paints humanity as savages.  There is an extreme distrust of human nature and human freedom.  As a Canadian citizen, it simply surprises me.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Brahma Atman Erudite Wizard Bertoxx</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubrahmaatman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brahma Atman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/02 7:39:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> Raufann wrote:<br>

As I thought, you haven't bothered to read the actual framers of the Constitution when they wrote about what they meant.

But he pointed out this remote possibility was superior to the alternative - not being allowed to defend one's self.<br>
<br>
By the way the &quot;militia&quot; argument is pretty easy to brush aside, if you bothered to study what a militia WAS back then and what the founders said about it.  Give it a shot - the grey areas are created by people trying to redefine facts and obvious statements.<br>

This is pointless, none of us here will make a difference, I just get annoyed at idiotic statements and ignorant stands that have the appearance of authority or intelligence.  Ordinarily I appreciate what you have to say and how you say things Torcer, but you pretty obviously haven't really looked at this closely YOURSELF and are relying on second hand information.  Further you are trying to redefine things that are painfully clear and obvious to any common person.  This happens a lot with people that have just enough education to get themselves in trouble, I see it all the time with kids just out of college who think they know the entirety of knowledge and assume that it came from the mouth of God to their professor's ear (except of course God doesn't exist and neither does truth). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ualtruxquestmaster.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Altrux Questmaster</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/02 8:48:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=136>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://personal.bhm.bellsouth.net/bhm/l/l/llid/EQ/altruxhat.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: simple things complicated</span><hr size=1> please forgive teh bad type, its late<br>

actually no, the only reason its in the bill of rights was half of teh states wanted it in there before they would ratify teh constitution, the vast majority of the foudnding fathers wanted no bill of rights, instead of defining liberties (liek right to bear arms and right to free speach) they prefered to define responsibilities,  (liek voting) in this way, a persons could do anything they wanted, as long as it wasn't tehir responsibility to do otherwise, teh end point to this was that liberties owulnd't be taken away by some oen sayign that the constitution defines all liberties, such as free speach and arms,  adn thats not oen of the named liberties <p>Illegal javascript event tags or url parameters detected.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uraufaan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Raufaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/15/02 8:58:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=137>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The burden of proof for any argument is based on the strength of the argument.

     Don't you realize that the argument you just made undermines your point about the words of the Constitution requiring no interpretation?  You have just used an extra-Constitutional source to mae the words more clear.  Just like the Court does.  So, you see, the words are ambiguous.  Oh well, I have read what the Framers stated about militias, which were the dominant form of state military organization for defesne at the time.  <br>
<br>
     Instead of this game, where we take Grimstaff's word about what the framers thought about militias, I'll provde the text of Federalist Paper #29, by Alexander Hamilton, below.  The readers can draw their own conclusions about what the framers meant by &quot;militia&quot; and the Second Amendment.  The date of the Paper was January 10, 1788.  Federalist 29, in all its glory:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> To the People of the State of New York: <br>
<br>
THE power of regulating the militia, and of commanding its services in times of insurrection and invasion are natural incidents to the duties of superintending the common defense, and of watching over the internal peace of the Confederacy. <br>
<br>
It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union ``to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.'' <br>
<br>
Of the different grounds which have been taken in opposition to the plan of the convention, there is none that was so little to have been expected, or is so untenable in itself, as the one from which this particular provision has been attacked. If a well-regulated militia be the most natural defense of a free country, it ought certainly to be under the regulation and at the disposal of that body which is constituted the guardian of the national security. If standing armies are dangerous to liberty, an efficacious power over the militia, in the body to whose care the protection of the State is committed, ought, as far as possible, to take away the inducement and the pretext to such unfriendly institutions. If the federal government can command the aid of the militia in those emergencies which call for the military arm in support of the civil magistrate, it can the better dispense with the employment of a different kind of force. If it cannot avail itself of the former, it will be obliged to recur to the latter. To render an army unnecessary, will be a more certain method of preventing its existence than a thousand prohibitions upon paper. <br>
<br>
In order to cast an odium upon the power of calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, it has been remarked that there is nowhere any provision in the proposed Constitution for calling out the POSSE COMITATUS, to assist the magistrate in the execution of his duty, whence it has been inferred, that military force was intended to be his only auxiliary. There is a striking incoherence in the objections which have appeared, and sometimes even from the same quarter, not much calculated to inspire a very favorable opinion of the sincerity or fair dealing of their authors. The same persons who tell us in one breath, that the powers of the federal government will be despotic and unlimited, inform us in the next, that it has not authority sufficient even to call out the POSSE COMITATUS. The latter, fortunately, is as much short of the truth as the former exceeds it. It would be as absurd to doubt, that a right to pass all laws NECESSARY AND PROPER to execute its declared powers, would include that of requiring the assistance of the citizens to the officers who may be intrusted with the execution of those laws, as it would be to believe, that a right to enact laws necessary and proper for the imposition and collection of taxes would involve that of varying the rules of descent and of the alienation of landed property, or of abolishing the trial by jury in cases relating to it. It being therefore evident that the supposition of a want of power to require the aid of the POSSE COMITATUS is entirely destitute of color, it will follow, that the conclusion which has been drawn from it, in its application to the authority of the federal government over the militia, is as uncandid as it is illogical. What reason could there be to infer, that force was intended to be the sole instrument of authority, merely because there is a power to make use of it when necessary? What shall we think of the motives which could induce men of sense to reason in this manner? How shall we prevent a conflict between charity and judgment? <br>
<br>
By a curious refinement upon the spirit of republican jealousy, we are even taught to apprehend danger from the militia itself, in the hands of the federal government. It is observed that select corps may be formed, composed of the young and ardent, who may be rendered subservient to the views of arbitrary power. What plan for the regulation of the militia may be pursued by the national government, is impossible to be foreseen. But so far from viewing the matter in the same light with those who object to select corps as dangerous, were the Constitution ratified, and were I to deliver my sentiments to a member of the federal legislature from this State on the subject of a militia establishment, I should hold to him, in substance, the following discourse: <br>
<br>
``The project of disciplining all the militia of the United States is as futile as it would be injurious, if it were capable of being carried into execution. A tolerable expertness in military movements is a business that requires time and practice. It is not a day, or even a week, that will suffice for the attainment of it. To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well-regulated militia, would be a real grievance to the people, and a serious public inconvenience and loss. It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the present numbers of the people, would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent, would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not succeed, because it would not long be endured. Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year. <br>
<br>
``But though the scheme of disciplining the whole nation must be abandoned as mischievous or impracticable; yet it is a matter of the utmost importance that a well-digested plan should, as soon as possible, be adopted for the proper establishment of the militia. The attention of the government ought particularly to be directed to the formation of a select corps of moderate extent, upon such principles as will really fit them for service in case of need. By thus circumscribing the plan, it will be possible to have an excellent body of well-trained militia, ready to take the field whenever the defense of the State shall require it. This will not only lessen the call for military establishments, but if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.'' <br>
<br>
Thus differently from the adversaries of the proposed Constitution should I reason on the same subject, deducing arguments of safety from the very sources which they represent as fraught with danger and perdition. But how the national legislature may reason on the point, is a thing which neither they nor I can foresee. <br>
<br>
There is something so far-fetched and so extravagant in the idea of danger to liberty from the militia, that one is at a loss whether to treat it with gravity or with raillery; whether to consider it as a mere trial of skill, like the paradoxes of rhetoricians; as a disingenuous artifice to instil prejudices at any price; or as the serious offspring of political fanaticism. Where in the name of common-sense, are our fears to end if we may not trust our sons, our brothers, our neighbors, our fellow-citizens? What shadow of danger can there be from men who are daily mingling with the rest of their countrymen and who participate with them in the same feelings, sentiments, habits and interests? What reasonable cause of apprehension can be inferred from a power in the Union to prescribe regulations for the militia, and to command its services when necessary, while the particular States are to have the SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS? If it were possible seriously to indulge a jealousy of the militia upon any conceivable establishment under the federal government, the circumstance of the officers being in the appointment of the States ought at once to extinguish it. There can be no doubt that this circumstance will always secure to them a preponderating influence over the militia. <br>
<br>
In reading many of the publications against the Constitution, a man is apt to imagine that he is perusing some ill-written tale or romance, which instead of natural and agreeable images, exhibits to the mind nothing but frightful and distorted shapes ``Gorgons, hydras, and chimeras dire''; discoloring and disfiguring whatever it represents, and transforming everything it touches into a monster. <br>
<br>
A sample of this is to be observed in the exaggerated and improbable suggestions which have taken place respecting the power of calling for the services of the militia. That of New Hampshire is to be marched to Georgia, of Georgia to New Hampshire, of New York to Kentucky, and of Kentucky to Lake Champlain. Nay, the debts due to the French and Dutch are to be paid in militiamen instead of louis d'ors and ducats. At one moment there is to be a large army to lay prostrate the liberties of the people; at another moment the militia of Virginia are to be dragged from their homes five or six hundred miles, to tame the republican contumacy of Massachusetts; and that of Massachusetts is to be transported an equal distance to subdue the refractory haughtiness of the aristocratic Virginians. Do the persons who rave at this rate imagine that their art or their eloquence can impose any conceits or absurdities upon the people of America for infallible truths? <br>
<br>
If there should be an army to be made use of as the engine of despotism, what need of the militia? If there should be no army, whither would the militia, irritated by being called upon to undertake a distant and hopeless expedition, for the purpose of riveting the chains of slavery upon a part of their countrymen, direct their course, but to the seat of the tyrants, who had meditated so foolish as well as so wicked a project, to crush them in their imagined intrenchments of power, and to make them an example of the just vengeance of an abused and incensed people? Is this the way in which usurpers stride to dominion over a numerous and enlightened nation? Do they begin by exciting the detestation of the very instruments of their intended usurpations? Do they usually commence their career by wanton and disgustful acts of power, calculated to answer no end, but to draw upon themselves universal hatred and execration? Are suppositions of this sort the sober admonitions of discerning patriots to a discerning people? Or are they the inflammatory ravings of incendiaries or distempered enthusiasts? If we were even to suppose the national rulers actuated by the most ungovernable ambition, it is impossible to believe that they would employ such preposterous means to accomplish their designs. <br>

In times of insurrection, or invasion, it would be natural and proper that the militia of a neighboring State should be marched into another, to resist a common enemy, or to guard the republic against the violence of faction or sedition. This was frequently the case, in respect to the first object, in the course of the late war; and this mutual succor is, indeed, a principal end of our political association. If the power of affording it be placed under the direction of the Union, there will be no danger of a supine and listless inattention to the dangers of a neighbor, till its near approach had superadded the incitements of selfpreservation to the too feeble impulses of duty and sympathy.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
