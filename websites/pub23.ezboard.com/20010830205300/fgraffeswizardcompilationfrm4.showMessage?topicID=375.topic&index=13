<br>
I can kind of see where you are going with this - and yes,  I know there are areas that Wizards DD spells are less than other classes at some levels.<br>
<br>
I believe that in the past during the class balance talks, some folks put together a listing that compared all of these discrepencies across the board.<br>
<br>
Yes - we should be undisputed, but how does the inefficiencies affect the game play overall?<br>
<br>
Does the fact that a Mage or a Cleric at X level having a spell that Y damage truly hurt the Wizard?<br>
<br>
It is my understanding that our spells are much more mana efficient as well as not having special requirements attached to them. By requirements, I mean that some of the Mages spells are bolts and require line of sight. That may or may not make a difference. Also - yes, the Cleric spells are very powerful to the Undead. But then again - that is their specialty?<br>
<br>
Should VI change things across the board so that Wizards are undusputed from 1 through 60? Probably - I mean it would be nice to have them fine tune Shaman, Bards, Clerics, Wizards, Magicians, etc:. I think all of the classes out there have some issues from 1 through 60. <br>
<br>
But - take a moment and think of how VI views this...<br>
<br>
EQ has been out more than 2 years. Server populations are busting at the seams. Folks that started when the game was released are probably in their 50+ level by now. The dynamics of the game have changed quite a bit. Many, many patches, updates, nerfs, new items, abilities, etc:<br>
<br>
EQ is top heavy now in their eyes and they must keep up with what they have created. The top end folks want more. They have conquered it all now and now have twink second and third chars. VI cannot keep up. VI will never admit that folks have beaten their game. Never. They want the game to continue on and on. Forever retaining that customer through continuing updates, additions and expansions. <br>
<br>
They are so busy catering to the high end crowd that - yes - the issues pre 50 that need the most work, are not going to be looked at as a high priority.<br>
<br>
Take a look at how long it takes them to create an expansion. Velious with all of the beautiful graphics, etc: probably took then well over 6 months. It was released in December and I believe that in February or March, I was reading posts from people already in ToV and other high areas in the expansion.<br>
<br>
Face it folks - VI cannot keep up with their customer demands for new stuff. It simply takes too long to create it. Folks buy it, say how nice the graphics and new abilities are, and march right through it in half the time they took to create it.<br>
<br>
I honestly feel sorry for them, as they have an appearance that they do not have the bandwidth to pay attention to these details.<br>
<br>
Think of VI as a hamster in a wheel...  They have to keep going and going and going. The customers continually want more and are extremely demanding - yet they must remain highly profitable and keep their content fresh.<br>
<br>
Could they do more - yes - I think they could. I personally think that they are running around putting out fires continuously that if they take a moment to look at the bigger picture, they could be more efficient in alot of different ways. IMHO.<br>
<br>
But - they want to retain as many customers as they possibly can. They are - um - yes - a business! But as a business, or any business they have flaws. There are flaws with their product. <br>
<br>
Personally - I am aware of their flaws not only within normal gameplay, but also my class. Other classes have them too.<br>
<br>
I think the real question I come back to is:<br>
<br>
Do these flaws greatly affect gameplay for the vast majority of players?<br>
<br>
I do not think that there is one answer on how to fix (if needed) Wizards pre 50. I think there are many factors here. Too many in fact for VI to take the time to understand them all. I honestly think they do not have the time or the ambition to go back and review each and every class 1 through 60 and change the discrepencies. It is a nice thought - a noble ambition, but with the need to generate fresh content, one can see where their priorities are.<br>
<br>
My personal belief?<br>
<br>
hehehe  ready?  here it comes...<br>
<br>
I believe that they should stop mudflation (this affects all casting classes - not just Wizards), revitalize the tradeskills (heck - if and 13YO wants to make pie tins all day long to make money - then so be it), and make the risk versus reward a true phrase.<br>
<br>
I do not think that the Warrrens cheat code will do anything to stop farming. If folks realize that they can make money from learning a valued tradeskill, the farming will slow down. I do not believe it will ever stop - but would you rather have players in town learning trades or have them camping dungeons for items to sell in town and taking up spawn spots that other players have travelled to, to *gasp* actually get an item they will use?<br>
<br>
My 2 cp for the day...<br>

Also, stating that these things are true and that Verant has repeatedly told us we are about the best blast every level are all objective fact.  They have.  When we pointed out other classes have good blasts they say &quot;yeah but each blast you have is better&quot; which isn't true.  All facts.  The conclusions you draw from this are your own, but I think its inescapable that Verant made mistakes in the spell line up.  Do you truly think they are infallible? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg BORDER=0> at: 8/3/01 8:49:39 am<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=388.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=372.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=375.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=375.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=375.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=375.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm31">Fusibility Research<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm11">Velium Chill of Al'Kabor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm6">Tome of Ages Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm30">Veeshan's Peak Key</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4>Rant Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
