Not sure if I've posted this already, but my opinion is that melee damage also should be reduced to 66%, to balance PvP. Right now, its a joke that caster damage is nerfed. Even without this nerf, casters would probabaly be at a disadvantage. <br>
I'm feedbacking this regularly.<br>

<br>
Interesting comments.  <br>
In EQ PvP, four things will determine about 90% of the fights.<br>
1.)Speed.  If you can outrun your opponent, you have a huge tactical advantage, be you caster or melee.<br>
2.)Preparedness.  Buffed, or unbuffed, fm, oom, etc<br>
3.)Gear.  Resists, AC, Regeneration.  Hitting for 40 or 120 a shot<br>
4.)Level<br>
<br>
All of these things being equal, it's all about skill<br>
<br>
Does caster damage need to go back to full?  Maybe.  Tanks do have a lot of hitpoints at the higher levels, but I really don't see a lot of imbalance (assuming the four points above are all equal)<br>
<br>
Reducing melee damage in PvP is NOT a good idea.  It has a LOT more ramifications than just allowing a caster to live for a few more hits.  Damage shields and Regeneration gear both come to mind.  As it is, a level 60 monk could practically beat himself to death against a druid.  (Of course, monks are the worst solo PvP class, IMHO, because of their inability to do anything beyond beat on their target).  <br>
<br>
Yes, you could burn your entire mana bar, and not kill a tank.  I fought a enchanter for 35 minutes as a Shadow Knight.  Enchanter couldn't get me below half life, I couldn't stick close enough to hurt the enchanter, between the occasional root stick, mezes, etc.   Eventually, she grav-fluxed a little too close to a guard, and it ended badly for her.  <br>
<br>
This was one of those rare cases where neither party was unprepared (I was wearing MR rings, MR shield, 14 24 1hs [with fbss 14 21, give or take a point]), she was full life, full mana, claritied, runed (we talked about the fight for a while after she recovered her corpse).  She was a level higher than me (46 to 45)<br>
<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp<br>

If the caster cannot fina a safe place to hide or run out of melee range to, yes the melee will win.  <br>
<br>
What you don't mention is that in a lot of situations, a caster <br>
Can find a hidden place to nuke from.  Also, shadow step line of spells is a very useful tool for evading melees.<br>
<br>
Get a melee character targetted and casters can nuke them through walls, you forget to consider this too.<br>

Also a rogue can quad plus dubble backstab for more then sunstrike does, even if the 66% rule is changed.<br>

The fact is that as things are right now so have melee classes an easier time against casters then the other way around.<br>

<br>
When i'm a warrior i fear A LOT caster  for several reason :<br>
- wizard lure, necro splurt which is NOT nerf at all and life tap, druid wing of death ... all of those are not resistible<br>
- Defuff resist spell (ench especially, druid fire much less, mage and shaman well ... they need to pass MR ...)<br>
- dmg shield, i'm killing myself on that if i'm dual wielding but if i'm wearing a 2HS i barely interrrupt a caster<br>
- the EQ bugs : Go fight a caster that is using the hill bug is like hunting an illusion .... you think you are after the nasty casters and ... pooff ... no more caster but you fell your skin to froze ..etc. Mister/Miss the caster has just ran to a hill, shadow step and for me he was still running.<br>
<br>
My resist are not the best but they are enought to beat normal pve stuff and is good against anycaster under lvl 51<br>
MR 130 FR 95 CR 120 PR 50 DR 55<br>
(and don't speak of BD stuff or fungi ... they are out of price for me .... BD stuff is going cheaper but it's still around 7K at least for a bracer on pvp server and fungi around the 20/ 30k)<br>
<br>
For those who say warrior have lots of hp mmmm i guess you are each time talking of an ogre warrior. In pvp, not all warrior are ogre .... the little ones exist too. At lvl 54 unbuff and with pvp gear i have around 2k2 ...<br>
<br>
So if the cap was to be remove a lvl 60 caster would eat me alive easily (Tzt = +/-8 lvl), 2 dot of a necro would kill me, 2 wizard dd too ...etc ... that would be pretty unfair for me, don't you think ? Can i kill a caster in 2 rounds mmmm don't think so<br>
<br>
<br>
Now the wizard point of view. She is not playing in the hight court like she is only lvl 35. How ever, expet if the person i'm facing is a twink with some resist &gt; 90 or more than 3 lvl higher than me which makes me see &quot;resist resist ..&quot; ... well without that, the melee = toasted melee in no time.<br>
<br>
Forget MR base spell like people increase MR at first (movement is on of teh key of pvp) ..so FR or CR based DD and life can go down very very fast.<br>
<br>
The only pb i have faced is against ranger and SK like they interrupt my spell (dual with ranger) and they possible snare/dark i can have on me. In all case, if i'm not pvp ready against a melee and full mana, i'm quite sure to lose (no SS = bad bad bad bad for me)<br>
<br>
I still think that the 66% is good at those lvl like the chance to win a fight between 2 lvl 50- seems to be good but the 51/60 game is very unballanced to me with all the massive dmg and lure spell that exist and have been made to kill very resistible mob and not player. ( with 3 spell a necro can kill any caster even if he has 255 in all resist : splut + bond of death + life tape ..... none car be resisted and splurt does 100% and not 66% in pvp .... )<br>

im talking about 55+ battling in a PVP server not duels<br>
i am talking about hardcore pvpers not people who can be rooted and snared like n00bs and people with full resist gear and such<br>
so i dont really want n00b remarks about how soandso kill a pally in a duel once and such it really peeves me off<br>
<br>
example:<br>
I see melee I target and open up with lure<br>
lure hits does normal damage<br>
<br>
follow up with draught does 80 points of damage or so<br>
<br>
melee reacts clicks his golem wand twice most of my buffs are gone so i have jboots/sow lev left since they on bottom<br>
<br>
if lev still up melee with wand or pumice it off so im buff less on the ground <br>
<br>
im melleed 1/2 my life is gone when a primal pally doubles me for 214 or tantors tusk hits or rogue Double BS me, or ranger pumpels me( since DS potion debufed i got nada)<br>
<br>
i run around like dork<br>
<br>
shadowstep takes me 2 feet down hill yonder takes me a bit far melee catches up melees me again and im dead<br>
<br>
maybe i'll get 4 or 5 nukes w/ faster recast delay temp flux at most get him to 75% health <br>
<br>
and even IF i got him low all he has to do and run and regen hp with fungi or sk just taps me or pally heals or monk mends <br>
or ranger uses bow n arrow dis and kils me<br>
<br>
Wizards are broken im afraid to say<br>
<br>
I can kill other wizards, mages, some druids, and anyone w/o resists<br>
<br>
but thats about it<br>

<br>
You just need to take extreme care to NOT let them get close enough to hit you, this means not trying to channel thru attacks if they see you casting halfway thru, this means duck, and yonder/shadowstep when they spot you.<br>
<br>
The only thing that really pissed me off about the 62.5% damage in pvp (yes, it's actaully 62.5%) is that heals still heal full.<br>
<br>
so on a druid with good resists where only lure would work, i can hit him for 515 in pvp, for 320 mana with lure of ice.<br>
<br>
but the druid can negate that with 2 chloroblasts in nearly the same time, for less mana =x making a druid who simply heals himself, totally unkillable.<br>
chloroblast is... 385 hp's for 175 mana i believe? something close. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/11/02 7:41:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: melee vs caster ..and the 66% cap of pvp</span><hr size=1> Hello, I'm a 56 rogue on RZ with epic, thurgadin quest armor, decent resist gear that I do wear in pvp and a fair amount of pvp experience I think I should just clarify a few things for you.<br>
<br>
Melees HUGE hp.  Not all of us have like 3k hp in resist gear at 56 I have 1700.  This means even a lowbie nuke like IC if it hit for full could do most of my hp if the 66% dmg nerf was removed.  This is not even going into how much this change would hurt casters with their lower hp.<br>
<br>
Melee dmg.  Melee dmg distribution is NOTHING like spell dmg. If you look at the dmg done by lures in pvp you will see a steady dmg output that is nearly always near max.  If you look at melee dmg on the other hand its very inconsistant from moment to moment and the average dmg is MUCH lower than max.  In other words people might say wow he backstabbed for 500! then ignore the fact that the bs before that missed and the 2 before that did minimum dmg.<br>
<br>
Getting nukes off in pvp. Consider these strategies...<br>
<br>
You can levitate and nuke from from overhead be sure to bury it deep in your buff stack.<br>
<br>
You can rune yourself once the rune is done with you can shadowstep and recast and come back.  This is expensive mannawise until you get your epic though but hey how much of your manna do you really need to kill someone with 1700hp?  You may die to a double backstaab but your not gonna run oom.<br>
<br>
You can &quot;step into the nuke&quot; as a friend of mine put it.  Channeling is a simple loc comparison.  The game compares the loc you started at and the one the spell ended at. Melee dmg will move you.  The further you move the harder it is to pass the channeling check.  Its possible to move back to negate the movement caused by the hits.<br>
<br>
You can cast through walls.  Sure this is cheap but its there.<br>
<br>
You can use melee range to your advantage melees can't hit a moving target so you can run around as long as you need to avoid dmg.  This is about 2x as effective if you zig zag rather than move in a straight line.  as my lowbie sk I've had casters 30% snared (clinging darkness) and had them avoid a fair bit of melee dmg by jerky movements.  They still died <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  but this does tend to work better when your NOT snared.<br>
<br>
You can shadowstep and yonder to cast.<br>
<br>
Last and best you can take the initiative.  You like rogues are a pure offense class. So move in and nuke their ass hard before they even know your comming and see what kind of advantage that gives you.  Hell they might not even have the right resist gear up considering the best ac hp int wis manna isn't usually the best resist stuff.<br>
<br>
Now on the subject of nerfing melee dmg to 66% are you crazy? As a rogue with great offensive skills its still hard to kill wizards with enough pr to resist poison.  Outdoors its not gonna happen unless they are dumb they will yonder away before death.  Indoors they still have the option of running for zone in many places and since I can't hit a moving target more than once in a blue moon I can't stop em very easily.  Add to that the fact that they can channel gate very consistantly through fast melee dmg.  If they were to take you up on your suggestion my character would be a joke and deleted not long after with a lot of other rogues.<br>
<br>
The fact that ANYONE could suggest not only nerfing melee dmg or removing the spell dmg nerf but both at once is a shocking thing for me.  My suggestion.  Ask Verant for a refund for the time you've wasted you don't belong on a pvp server if you suck that much.  Do you need every other player to be reduced to impotency while your buffed to a stupid lvl of power to make up for your lack of skill? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umakyz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Makyz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/19/02 4:40:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: melee vs caster ..and the 66% cap of pvp</span><hr size=1> melees are far overpowered in the pvp situation Aerimus.<br>

<br>
2-3 clicks and then the caster yonders, harmshields, DAs, Shadowsteps and rebuffs and your out a lot of plat.  How long can you keep burning plat that way.  For me even though I know the use of em this is still something I only use occasionally and as far as hp I've been fighting a 60 necro with roughly 1.6k hp unbuffed lately.  Has almost as much hp as I do in pvp gear, thx info.&quot;<br>
<br>
What about the fact that every lvl 60 caster I've fought has channeled through epic dmg output around 100% of the time WITH me hitting them for near the spells full duration?  What about the fact that all you have to do is run in a circle to avoid me hitting you but you can nuke me from a mile away through a wall and around 2 corners.<br>
<br>
What about the fact that necros after 54 can suck hp at about 63dps in pvp with no hope of interuption.  Or channel vex through 10 melee hits and run around for a minute while most of their hp come back.  How about the fact that without golem wand all a necro has to do is land even 1 dot and the fight is over because the rogue with 0 channeling skill can't dispell it.<br>
<br>
What about the fact that a caster has buffs that if they remain up give the caster 100% chance of victory vs me that I cannot remove without golem wands if they spam 2 insta cast items.<br>
<br>
What about the fact that its possible to run in a circle while your pet chews on a melee because we can't hit a moving target.<br>
<br>
Without the 66% dmg nerf on most pvp spells (drood swarm dots seem to do 100%) being a rogue on rallos zek not only wouldn't be fun it would be an exercise in futility.<br>
<br>
Besides this you are so stuck on the caster vs melee issue that you don't understand how much removing the dmg nerf would hurt other casters as well.  Wizards would basicly utterly destroy all other caster classes with little effort way too fast.<br>
<br>
See my post regarding a suggestion for more properly tuning spell dmg in pvp please.<br>
<br>
One last note...Harmtouch is a spell.  If you got rid of the dmg nerf it would be hitting for 1500 in pvp at 60 enjoy.<br>

PREACH ON BROTHER!<br>
<br>
I nearly fell out of my chair laughing at this thread....<br>
<br>
45 Warrior, 20 Shaman, 16 Wizard on RZ.<br>
<br>
To the individual who stated one should wear a fungi tunic through a fight... Are you insane? That sucker gets bagged, like RIGHT NOW. Trust me, you may drop me, but you ARE NOT going to loot a 4-5k tunic off of me.<br>
<br>
Wearing it at all is a problem that has to be very carefully considered - because if you put it on, that means you are low on hit points, and THAT means you a nice, juicy target.<br>
<br>
Casting through walls is a problem, but so is casting from UP a wall. Wizzy climbs up a wall (like in Everfrost), and can nuke away - meanwhile our melee friend is slobbering away trying to climb up it (because he can't seem to aim a bow UP - for some god-forsaken reason only Verant understands...).<br>
<br>
The further point that my esteemed Rallos Zek colleague has brought up that is getting no consideration from the other posters is that without the nerf casters would pull one nuke and drop another caster instantly.<br>
<br>
Nerfing melee damage by 66%??? It already is. The moving target disaster effectively does that (probably nerfs it for more, if ya ask me). Your nerf, plus the nerf that already is in there because of screwed up moving target and target too high/low messages from a bow means we will be doing negative damage. <br>
<br>
If you nerf melee damage, we warriors should then be provided with a discipline at level one called Self-Disembowelment. You type /disc self and kill yourself immediatly - still allowing your antagonist to loot... it just gets you to the corpse run quicker.<br>
<br>
ANY wizard that gets killed by a melee below lvl 50 is too stupid to play the game and should retire to a blue server immediatly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwolandgrauensturm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Woland Grauensturm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/22/02 7:06:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=38>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whats the purpose of the 66% nerf</span><hr size=1> <br>
The PvP spell nerf is just a lame, highly unbalancing nerf from the time when melee's didn't have 15/20 weapons, capped haste and 100+ unbuffed resists. <br>
<br>
Removing the spell nerf would be the single biggest improvement for overall PvP balance.<br>

A large majority of high end rogues have 15 25s and nobody can have more than 40% perma haste.  If they are hasted (or otherwise buffed) dispell.<br>
<br>
<br>
Melees describe weapons in terms of dmg/dly ratios.<br>
<br>
A 15 20 is a .75 weapon max haste which is only achievable buffed is 100% a .75 weapon with 100% haste becomes 1.5<br>
<br>
A 15 25 weapon is a .6 weapon with 40% haste it becomes .84<br>
<br>
This isn't even considering the pre 50 rogues that would be even worse off than the high end rogues. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A> at: 2/22/02 7:27:41 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/22/02 11:49:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whats the purpose of the 66% nerf</span><hr size=1> People from Rallos Zek should remember to mention that its there they are talking about, not pvp in general. 1 in 4 server doesnt qualify as the standard (thats not even counting duels on blue servers).
