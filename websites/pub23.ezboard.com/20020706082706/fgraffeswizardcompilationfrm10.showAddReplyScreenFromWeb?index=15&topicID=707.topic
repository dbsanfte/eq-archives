<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  ...because if we didn't then some random cleric could decide that for today he/she wants to be a wizard and nuke, so now all of a sudden they're nuking for as much as a wizard. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is not a good argument really.  You still have to explain why it's bad for cleric nukes to equal wizard nukes.  Wizards do more than nuke, clerics do more than heal.  Maybe in another game teleports would be more valuable than heals.  Then you could have two balanced classes, one with with nukes and ports and the other with nukes and heals.<br>
<br>
I will agree with you that, in everquest, it would be bad for the game if clerics were able to set aside their healing abilities and equal a wizard in nukes.  However, it is not necessarily <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  unbalanced</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  This is not balanced, if you do things this way you may as well not have classes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->See my previous argument.  This is a mere declaration, not a logical conclusion.  Again, even if clerics could nuke exactly like wizards, it is still possible for the classes to have enough differences for there to be a compelling reason to play either one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Wizards can't just decide to be clerics one day, and clerics should not be able to act as wizards. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Who are you to say what can and cannot be in the game?  This is just your opinion, yet you are stating it as if it is an absolute truth.  Quite obviously, Verant has decided that it's ok for clerics to act like wizards if they want to.. here's the catch though-  try as they might, Clerics will never nuke as well as wizards.  When the battle is over and you're tallying the results, a wizard doing his job will almost always come out ahead of a cleric trying to be a wizard.  Chances are that the difference will be an amount that is generally considered &quot;significant.&quot;  <br>
<br>
I know that I, as a magician, generally nuke better than a cleric.  I also know that a wizard nukes significantly better than I.  Generally..  half of my damage is pet, the other half is nukes.  In many situations, the wizard nukes alone will deal as much damage as both me and my pet.  I would call that &quot;significant.&quot;  If wizards have significantly better nukes than magicians and if magicians have marginally better nukes than clerics, then my guess is that wizard nukes are also significantly better than cleric nukes. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A> at: 4/26/02 10:31:51 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/27/02 8:19:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=707.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> *shaking head*</span><hr size=1> &quot;I know that I, as a magician, generally nuke better than a cleric.

<br>
That's so untrue it makes me laugh out loud.  You are saying in so many words &quot;wizards nuke twice as hard as I do&quot; and that's total horsecrap.  What exactly are you trying to prove by defending Clerics nuking nearly as hard as Wizards AND being premeire healers AND wearing plate AND buffing AND using superior weapons AND having superior combat skills AND having better hps.  OH, but Wizards can teleport and snare....  Mages never cease to stun me with the bizarre apparent belief that Wizards are some kind of utility Gods and nuke on the side.<br>
<br>
Are you arguing for the sake of argument?  I know you aren't deluded enough to think that Clerics and Wizards are balanced only if Clerics can nuke almost as well or better than Wizards.  Take away EVERY SINGLE nuke that Clerics have and thier power, utility, use to a group, and even soloing ability is almost totally unchanged.  <br>
<br>
The fact is, they shouldn't have ever been given nukes in the first place - if nukes hadn't been seeded so liberally and so similar in power among so many classes Wizards wouldn't be in the state they are now in Everquest.  Verant fears making Wizard nukes more powerful - maybe rightfully so.  But the reason Wizards probably SHOULD have more potent nukes is because when you compare to all the other classes, the distinction just is not very significant.  You can throw generalities and &quot;I think&quot; statements all you want but when the actual numbers hit the paper, it says a totally different story. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufynalwiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fynalwiz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/28/02 5:57:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=707.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: *shaking head*</span><hr size=1> &quot;Take away EVERY SINGLE nuke that Clerics have and thier power, utility, use to a group, and even soloing ability is almost totally unchanged.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is really the essential point. Cleric nukes seem to have just been put there as way to thumb thier noses at wizards. Incidentally, the other day I had the luxury of being in a group with a nuking cleric who was out-critting 900 to 1200. <br>
<br>
Why do clerics even SCF? If you took it away from them, capped thier nukes at, say 40, clerics would be needed just as much as they are today. The point isnt that clerics are more efficient nukers than wizards--they aren't. But they come too close, at too many levels to being able to nuke for as much. <br>
<br>
Wzard nuking doesnt  really start to seperate from the pack until 49plus., Cleric healing begins to dust other healers around 35 or so. I just want more distance in offensive magic, and I would like it to occur earlier. DOn't want to strip clercis of thier nukes? Fine. Cap them somewhere before 50.<br>

However, wizards don't get dots...why not? Shouldn't we at least get ones that do 800 to 1000 much like cleric nukes can now do 800 to 1000 ? I think clerics are overpowered in this instance because if there were two clerics in a group and no wizard, then one cleric can act as a wizard almost. But two wizards in a group with no cleric, and none of those wizards could act as a &quot;cleric&quot; for the group. That is taking clerics to be able to do more than one role, whereas a wizards one role is nuke, as clerics should be healing. <br>
