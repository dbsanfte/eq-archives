If you have read any of my previous posts you will see that I am often dissagreeing with people like Grimstaff. I have also played wizards off and on since I got the game a couple of months after eq went live. I've played from the ground up, being in a small guild to being in a top guild with complete spell line ups. I personally don't have trouble getting groups, and if you want to see others opinions of my skills or any suspected lack of knowledge on the game from people who have played with me, I suggest a quick browse through <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=1384.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20">this thread here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
I'm also not a moron, I realise that while I may not personally have a problem with the class( I love my wizard), that there must be a reason why others find the class so hard to get groups with. It's also not just a few people that are having these problems, I've seen countless threads posted by countless people on this forum in the almost 3 years I have been visisting this site. I don't agree that wizards are broken as some believe, but I do recognize that there are certain fundamental aspects of this game that have forced us into a very elite and often cirmcumspect role. I don't personally have a problem with this as *my own* view of the class has always been that we are hard to level up but the reward is gaining a role of one of the most desired classes in the raiding game. So for me, the prospect of a top notch raiding class has always been &gt; the need to get exp groups on the road there as long as the end reward was in line with my personal goals. It currently is.<br>
<br>
However, not everyone shares this point of view(nor should they have to, as I have come to believe), and I'm willing to discuss their beefs with the class and try to pinpoint exactly what it is that is causing so much strife among us. To say that it isn't there or that the problems don't exist is rather simplistic IMO. I say again, our problems are not a matter of perception alone, they stem directly from the fact that the game requires several features for the average group that are often best addressed or supported by a very small percentage of the actual classes. If there is a problem in perception, it is on the side of verant in their views on just how relevant our (casters in general for this point) utility spells are in the overal picture of game balance, and just how relevent it is for melee to be as strong as they are in &quot;marathon damage&quot; in relation to our own ability to sustain damage. Clearly there has to be a drawback to classes that have large arsenals of utility spells like ports etc, but should that drawback be directly linked to our own ability to find groups and/or to be efficient in our ability to sustain damage?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The xp grind is ONE SMALL FACET of this game.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, I agree. However, it is this &quot;ONE SMALL FACET&quot; of the game that directly controls 100% just how much you can accomplish in this game and is the only limiting factor on how far you can go. Having said that, I don't think most people take such a carefree attitude towards their character advancement. How many threads here to do you see asking &quot;How do you roleplay an Erudite?&quot; vs &quot;where's the best place to solo at lvl *?&quot; ?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Wizards will never be tuned to the point that they'll have a lock down for every group in the game. It's basically unfair that enchanters have that now.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I agree again. So what can the developers do to make us more attractive? The Grey was an idea in the right direction but it had an unfortunate drawback in that there was most definately issues with ae groups being far too powerful in this setting. I do think there are other ways to have gotten around this w/o the drastic changes that were initially taken. Without revamping the class or the class systems they had effectively designed a situation where the game deviated from the norm and made some of the less popular exp classes &gt; than the traditional game mentality. People actively sought out casters as a source of high damage for perhaps the first time since EQ proper.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I also (though haven't played since luclin) notice that pickup groups don't tend to form in many of the viable 45+ zones, I pointed out the hole. If people were really concerned with getting optimal xp, why aren't there more groups there taking advantage of the huge xp bonus the zone has? On my server, the people that try to form their groups based on some formula can't usually handle the hole anyway, so I guess it's just as well.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm glad you brought that up, actually. In the last 3 years we have seen the content of this game increase exponentially, in world size, level limits, skill gains and even the qaulity of loot.<br>
What has not changed in relation to the dramatically increased world size ( to any significant degree) is server populations. The result of this is that there are now many more zones that have people more spread out and long travel times to these zones on the off chance that you might actually find people there deters people from exploring them. Instead of risking a long journey to CoM or Kaesora that might take a couple of hours for a non porter to achieve, people will instead visit the same old hotspots that they know people will be at.<br>
<br>
There is a fix to this problem but it requires Verant to take a long look at the transportation system in this game and for them to decide that it's current abilities are the biggest limiting factor in getting people to take chances and to go out and explore new zones. Portal pots in all major cities going to all major cities and the ability to do a /who all ZONE NAME would do more to address this issue than any amount of uber gear or exp could(that just changes the hotspots and does not solve anything). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usollwinlifestar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sollwin Lifestar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://wwp.icq.com/scripts/online.dll?icq=119008099&img=5" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/17/01 7:39:38 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok...</span><hr size=1> I liked Wizards so much, I decided to play one. <p>Sildiven Azuenden<BR>

<br>
I apologize if it seemed that I was insulting your knowledge and skill of the game, I recognized that you are talking about a specific way of thinking that you don't necessarily subscribe to, and it was that that I was targeting for the most part.  I will admit though, that I reacted a bit harshly on purpose to a few things you said in your previous post.<br>
<br>
I do want to clarify one thing a little though.  When I said the xp grind is a small facet of the game, I am talking about the xp grind in most grinding sense of the word.  I don't mean getting a group or two of guildmates and fighting your way to the King in Sebilis, exploring a new luclin zone, or getting armor dropds in Kael or ToV.  In all those places, so long as you don't take more than two groups, you'll be able to get respectable amounts of experience and have fun at the same time.  I talking about the groups where wizards are the least effecient, that is the groups that sit in one place for 3 hours and pull identical low blue mobs one after the other.  The groups that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> only</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> care about experience.<br>
<br>
I don't really have a carefree attitude towards getting experience.  I like fast xp just as much as the next person.  What I don't do, is let it get in the way of my having fun.. I don't let it become the only thing I care about, and I really have not levelled slower than my peers, unless I was intentionally stalling to let people catch up, or as in this past semester where I have been behind a school firewall.<br>
<br>
It's true that gaining levels opens more doors and empowers you do fight in new places, but it also closes a chapter in the book of your character forever, and I like the idea that my character's history is rich and varied.  I feel like flying through the 30's in the overthere, for instance, causes you to miss out on a lot of great content designed for that level such as Dalnir, Sol A, TOFS, Lower Guk, and Sol B; and it causes you to miss out on experiencing your class to its full extent.  It's like, you miss out on getting to know what it's like to really be a level 35 enchanter if all you do is haste/clarity a group and mez adds every so often.<br>
<br>
What I found was that, as I explored the game and tested its bounds and the bounds of my class, the experience just came.  I even outlevelled a lot of my friends..

<br>
Some are very versitile, while others are not. Some can play many roles, while others are limited. It all comes down to what you enjoy playing. I can see where casting a couple &quot;mind blowing nukes&quot; and sitting down for the rest of the battle could be fun, but I myself like the fact that I can aid a group in many ways like snare, fear, desease (this one saved my guild in oasis against the named giant (long story)), DoT's,  Mana (yes, I can generate mana faster then most) and tanking (pet).<br>
<br>
My point is different mobs are best approached with different group makeups. Only two are for sure always (95%) needed, tanks and healers. Play what you enjoy the most, unless your an idiot you'll find a group!<br>

The irony that i have found is that i don't like to group. On a small time server like lanys, you get so many groups of retards who over pull, or a chanter who feels they must nuke, or a cleric who casts complete heal like 5 seconds too late. In all those cases i find myself emptying my mana bar at all these mobs so they will die in an orderly fashion. On the odd chance i get a good group, which isn't often on my server lol, it is GREAT to have a nice steady pull, and offers roughly the same exp as quading with a lot less med time, a much safer environment and much more social environment <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In particular, if a Druid is busy casting another spell, they cannot at the same time cast snare.  A Wizard, in contrast, is hardly ever casting spells, and so will be more likely available to cast Snare.

However, it is annoying when the dogma of maximum efficiency, which often lays claim to more rationality than is in fact justified, is used to limit the possibilities for grouping.  Many of those who claim to know what is most efficient are in fact mathematically illiterate, and mistake simple calculations for ultimate truths.  Every analysis is an approximation, and hence of limited value.  Someone who mistakes a local maximum for an absolute maximum obviously has never had calculus, and so is not qualified to declare with certainty what is optimally efficient.

All the important abilities Enchanters have in one package are similar to the problems with how Verant built Druids. Putting SOW, heals, snare, harvest, tracking, blasts, and DOTs in a single package was absurd. It isn't any secret why there are so many out there, even if it is a pretty dull class to play. For allegedly trying so hard to make classes interdependent and keep class abilities separate without being focussed to much in one area, Verant really was off base with some of their work. <br>

I know druid bashing is a favorite passtime on this board, but I can only hope that most wizards here realize how unfair this particular comparison is.  The important abilities that enchanters have rolled into one package are specialist abilities.  While it's true that druids do have a lot of abilities, they aren't specialists at any of skills Grimstaff mentioned except for snares, and druids don't get any form of mana regeneration until level 54--certainly they do not get Harvest.  Druids looking for groups at high levels often spend quite a bit of time LFG, and that's by no means entirely because of the bad reputation some druids have given the class.<br>

I get in any group I can and make it work. If I pull double duty as snarer/nuker you make it work. Some of the best groups have been the non &quot;holy trinity&quot;.<br>
<br>
I don't know about the rest of you but I have only had 1 time to &quot;pick a group&quot;. I went with the first /tell I got. If you have the luxury of waiting for &quot;the right group&quot; well, good for you.<br>
<br>
The most fun I had in a pick-up group was with a mage, necro, chanter and another wiz in DL at runis 2 (behind KC). I pulled =). no deaths and little use for a healer since the mobs never touched us. <p><BR>

That should have read HARMONY not harvest, but the problem with Druids isn't so much exclusive or specialist ability, its the sum total of all these abilities.  Druids are wont to try to brush aside the power of having them all in one class, but everyone really does know what it means. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utwonkgrubtrail.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TwonkGrubtrail</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(12/31/01 9:41:36 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: druids</span><hr size=1> This thread started out so well,  then look what happened to it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
