Having clerics camped and numerous corpses in a room doesn't mean you own that room and any rare mobs 'attached' to it.  As for them coming in and MBing it down I would have to say it's no different then a second guild coming in an taking it.  First try first guild, second try second guild.  The fact that it was just 4 wizards with over 23 AA points each is totally disregarded.<br>
<br>
As far as loot, they killed it, they got it.  As far as the reported tells were involved.  Well lets just say both sides woulda been better off not saying anything.<br>
<br>
As far as play nice policy goes.  The didn't just barge in and kill it, they *could* have waited until you pulled it and then just MBed it, looted, and gated out however they let you have a full blown attempt that went sour.  I know a few certain guilds on Solusek Ro that wouldn't even let you do that, heh.<br>
<br>
As far as &quot;guild backing&quot;, reputations of members influence that of the guild.  If one has a bad rep then the guild needs to discipline or remove that person.  If someone blatantly attempts to maim a certain person or a guild for one persons actions then THEY are the ones getting an even worse rep.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: Both sides should apologize for the words/posts that were made and leave it at that.<br>

<br>
the log tanom took was HOURS later... i did a who all FE      <br>
( damn if i can spell his guild) cuz someone in his guild asked if i had a green scale.. later that day we killed hosh got a scale and i just telled a random person in his guild if X was on in some form or another . First i thought it was DOW ( dogs of war ) raiding VS with FE help ( didnt c alot of u, hell just noticed 1 ). i then get cussed out by tanom  blah blah saying we ksed his staff.. first i heard he was raiding it or organized it. i explained my position he didnt like it...somewhere during this coversation i learned he needed a gnarled staff.. i respond with the &quot; i got a 2nd gnarled=) &quot; U notice he just posted only 2 freakin lines in the log.. cut and paste action..<br>
<br>
fact of the matter is we offered them the staff. whether tanom heard or anyone in his group told him i dont care. the <br>
&quot;i got a 2nd gnarled=) &quot; cut of the log was  me telling him i got a 2nd gnarled for a MQ.. its not me bragging..personally having 2 gnarled is no big deal. if i want to brag i could made fun of his gear etc etc etc.. i didnt else he would of posted it<br>
<br>
i explained my position in a civil matter.. whether a 2nd group should go in after a 1st one dies is debatable and varies per server.. EQ pnp rules support a 2nd group killing if first group dies . On tarew marr 2nd group has every right to kill if first looses.. if that is wrong on ur server, so be it but dont bitch at me about rules on ur server . on tarew marr there are NO rotations on any mob.. first one who gets the ppl there to kill X mob gets that mob . If 2 guilds race to same mob if first guilds die 2nd guild can and has the right to go in<br>
<br>
we were in zone 30 min or so b4 we killed, we just didn t have the wizards to do the job so  we didnt approach them. when a few more manaburn wizards logged on and ran to KC we learned that they died and were doing CR.. we then ran down and killed VS.. Some of u say we should of helped em do CR and let them have a 2nd shot.. Dont know what 4 wizards can do to further along a CR.. 2nd try? if the roles were reversed , would 40 ppl wait on us if by some miracle we lost? dont think so.. lets say we had 2 wiz a necro ready to burn down VS . we rush in and hope 1 of us crits do do the dmg... do we get a 2nd shot to kill it? or since we died and failed they go.. we lost to vs b4 when we brought 2 wizards and prayed 4 a crit . we didnt get it, and lost vs to another guild.<br>

<br>
To our alliance, this thread isn't nearly as much about the wizzie staff or any of the other loot that dropped. In fact, most of us did not know what a &quot;Gnarled&quot; was until well after the raid so we were probably ignorant when Kindom said &quot;U want gnarled?&quot; in ooc. <br>
<br>
We were not there to farm something. The other loot was secondary, though it could have been a nice bonus. We were there to help a member obtain a piece of his epic and to kill a monster that we have never killed before on our own. Something that could have been a major achievement for us.<br>
<br>
Kindom, I know from past experience that none of the five gulds in our alliance would have done what you guys did at any camp in the entire game because we realize that there are real people with feelings controlling every character we see.<br>
<br>
I have been personally involved with at least three races to VS in the past. When it became apparent that our competitors would have the necessary forces assembled before us, we wished the other guild good luck, thanked our members for trying and called it. Some members, including myself, even offered to help the guild that assembled before us. <br>
<br>
We have NEVER sat anyplace and watched like buzzards, hoping someone would fail a task so that we could swoop in and get a kill. <br>
<br>
I think you I are both smart enough to know the reason PNP rules are written the way they are is to minimize Verant's customer support (or as we like to say, non-support) time and costs, not to make sure that everything is fair. <br>
<br>
While I have to admit that your kill was legal by Verants PNP, it wasn't the ethical thing to do. You can make yourself feel as good as you want by quoting the PNP but the fact is you took advantage of a situation (the pull and bad call for tag by 1st time VS puller, yours truly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and ruined what otherwise was a great day for over 30 people.<br>
<br>
So to answer your question Kindom, YES, if the roles were reversed, I am 100% certain that the 30+ people present would have respected you enough to leave you alone and render any aid necessary. We've done that before.<br>
<br>
But then again, that's us.<br>
<br>
May I suggest that the next time a situation like this presents itself, instead of just taking what you want, try talking first. Offer up some advice from your many previous kills of the mob and generally be supportive of the less experienced people. Do the right thing. I'm sure we both would have had a much better day, both would have gotten the loot we desired and done away with the bad feelings that were the result of this encounter. <p><b><font color=yellow>Imvetter Danyew</font></b> 57 Smartass Iksar Monk<BR>

Hopefully, you'll get one soon. It's pretty craptacular to have to recover from a bad pull only to be beaten out by someone else. But, that's part of life. I haven't played much on Tarew Marr, but I see some things are pretty much a constant... and it's universal. <br>
<br>
It's frustrating to want something so bad &amp; have something like this happen. It just amazes me how folks seem to forget where they started &amp; just because they were lucky, they sit pretty in an intangible world. Unless it's bragging on EBay.. not many will give a crap at what little pixels you have and how many numbers are green on the right side of your bar. So just try to have fun &amp; remember this is a game. I personally won't say them taking it after a failure was wrong or right. They did what they felt they needed to do. I will say morally, I'm glad those aren't my shoes.<br>
