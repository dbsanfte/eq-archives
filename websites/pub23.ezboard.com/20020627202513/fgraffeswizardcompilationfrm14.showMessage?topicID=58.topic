ToV got an update shortly after this was posted, among other things, it was the update that rooted several NToV dragons, and added a few interesting spawns to the rest of the zone.  As such, some of the spawn locations on this map may not be correct.  Just bear with me, the camp locations are unchanged, as I've tested with several guilds.  <br><br>The General ToV Lap.  (Usually referred to just as a 'lap').<br><br>1. To start with, use Kohpry's strategy for breaking the pit and the two static spawns in it.  Once the entrance hall is broken, your puller is going to be grabbing everything in the hallways on your left to get the raid to about just above the (Arch of Chaos) guildtag next to Gumkak's name.  This is Camp 1.  You'll be pulling everything up to this point while the raid party is sitting in the pit, usually at the firepot.  Please teach your puller how to pull AEing mobs to this area.  Ideally, you want him/her to stop around the door area so that the casters and clerics can keep the wall next to the pot between them and the AE.  Having the puller yank the mob directly to the center of the pit wastes mana and slows down the rest of your lap. <br><br>2. Once you've reached Camp 1, you'll want to go about clearing everything between it and Camp 2.  Camp 2 is located at the corner in the middle right of the map, between the exit and that red static wurm spawn.  Use the same strategy that got you to Camp 1.  Pull everything between the camps back to the last camp, and move the raid to here.<br><br>(Note that the static wurm spawn directly north of Dozekar's room is workable from several camps. I've seen it pulled to Camp 1, Camp 2, and even the pit as prep for Camp 1.  How you do this mob is really up to the puller, the raid leader, and Dozekar).  <br><br>3. At Camp 2, you're going to begin what will probably be the hardest portion of your lap.  This is the part where you have to take down two named drakes, (If they're up, if not this section is a breeze).  Camp 3 is located dead center of Lepethida and Travekalem's spawn.  This spot is idea to pull to, since you've got either side of the little 'T'-shaped room to work with so your casters can avoid AEs.  Once you manage to split the two named drakes, and have taken over their camp, you're halfway done with the lap.<br><br>4. Camp 4 is directly above the phrase: &quot;Wall aggro&quot; on the map.  You'll want to clear both this camp, and any wandering mobs the puller can reach beyond it before moving in.  You want to pay special attention to the wandering mob in the hallway bordering Doz's room, as this little bugger has a nasty tendency to sneak up on the raid while you're engaged and shred all your casters.  <br><br>5. Camp 5 is the last actual camp you have on this lap, it is located on the named mob spawn point between Camp 4 and the pit.  I have never seen this mob up, so I don't know exactly what it is.  Plan on something that AEs, and you should be alright.  From this camp, the puller will hook around and grab what should be the last mob between the raid and the pit area, then whatever mobs to the S of you the raid can reach before you have to kill the pit mobs again.  Once you finish here, you've completed your first lap.<br><br>Variation 1: The mini lap.<br><br>If for whatever reason your raid leader decides that he can't take out the two drakes in Camp 3, or if taking them out was more costly than he thought, you can cut that lap short by running back through the N hallway above Doz's room and regrouping in the pit for another run.  These mini laps are safer than trying a full lap on half strength, though they will tend to annoy other raid parties if ToV is particularly busy that day.  <br><br>(From this point, I will be writing about Variations I have not actually participated in, only heard about 2nd hand.  If you run these, you will need to make allowances as you go along.  Plan accordingly, and plan for the absolute worst).  <br><br>Variation 2: The Extended Lap.  <br><br>This is typically attempted by a 2nd Tier guild or high level 3rd Tier guild.  Only try this if you seem to have a lot of downtime doing the basic lap.  Basically, the only major difference is that Camp 4 has been moved.  Instead of being above the words: &quot;Wall Aggro&quot;, you're now in the corner directly under the letter &quot;o&quot;.  From the &quot;O-spot&quot;, you can reach a lot more mobs.  The obvious downside of it is that if the raid takes longer than you were planning on, you may have to rebreak the pit area.  <br><br>Variation 3: The Master Lap.<br><br>This variation seems to be restricted to only the 1st tier or top 2nd tier guilds.  It's quite a bit more risky than the others, and you will need to rebreak the pit at the end.  <br><br>1. To pull this off, start your lap as normal, but don't head for Camp 3.  Instead, pull the two named drakes, and the wandering mob directly below Camp 3, but take the raid off at the first left before Camp 3, and set up camp in the corner directly across from the entrance to what would have been Camp 3.  From here, yank the next named spawn, the wanderer to the S of him, and the next static spawn between you and the exit portal.<br><br>2. Now, move camp to where that named mob spawned.  From here, take out everything between you and the exit portal, adjusting camp if you need to.  <br><br>3. Once this is done, take out everything S of this camp, again adjusting if you need to.  Move in to Camp 4 of the Extended lap, and continue on with the rest of your lap.  <br><br>(The master lap has a number of advantages.  Number one among these is that if you decide you've run into trouble, or bitten off more than you can chew, you've already cleared most of the way to the exit, so it's a short run to the portal out, where you can regroup.  Number two among these advantages is that your raid is clearing out mobs that are usually ignored by most ToV raids, which if you believe the theories surrounding the AC spawn in Sro, the Solist's Icy Wand camp, the theory about Lord Elgnub's spawn in Blackburrow, etc, should reset the RNG for drops in this area.  Making those rarer pieces easier to find.  Again though, this is just a theory).  <br><br>Variation 4: The Master + 1 lap.  (AKA The &quot;WTH aren't you in NToV by now?&quot; lap).<br><br>This lap is actually two laps, a Master lap, followed by a basic lap.  It will ensure that your raid mows down every single mob in this wing of ToV, barring Doz.  This should only be attempted by guilds that can successfully complete a Master Lap, and will likely be one of the last laps your guild completes before it moves on to the North Wing and the Plane of Mischief. <br><br>Variation 5: The Scorched Earth Lap.<br><br>This lap involves taking out Dozekar the Cursed right after you break the pit, then doing a normal 'Master + 1' lap.  It's typically attempted after a server has come back online, and all the named are now up.  This will maximize the guild's chances for getting all the ToV quest items from this wing.  It is the single crowning achievement for any guild able to do HoT laps.  <br><br>Variation 6: The Eastern Lap.<br><br>Every once in awhile, your raid will find itself in a position where it must compete with another ToV raid for spawns.  In this case, the Eastern lap comes into play.  To accomplish this, your raid will follow the other raid along it's normal lap, but split off when the first raid hits Camp 3.  Your raid will be looking at completing part of the master lap instead.  Using that strategy it's possible for your raid to kill it's own mobs without interfering with the first raid.  You will be looking at Running a normal Master lap from this point, but not moving in to Camp 4 of the Master lap.  Instead, pull everything N and S of the named spawn point for the Master lap, and then only adjust camp S to pick up any leftovers from the first raid and get the raid party out of the way before the N end of your raid respawns.  This isn't a particularly tough raid to manage if you have an experienced puller.  The only sticking point is going to be the wandering mob just past Camp 3 of the normal lap.  This mob will more than likely aggro your raid shortly after spawning, should the other raid not be already there waiting for him, or if your raid didn't adjust camp to get at some spawns when he pops.  <br><br>Once the first raid is finished, you have two options.  If you're in the N part of the raid, you can just have everyone zone out and zone back in for a normal set of laps.  You could also finish out the Southern part of your raid, and convert it into a normal Master lap if you feel confident.  You don't have to move the raid at all, but it may be easier to get late comers in to the raid area if you do.  <br><br>Final Comments:<br><br>Above all remember these things:<br>1. The two mobs in the pit have a 75 min respawn.  (This may have been changed, my information is a tad old and I haven't timed them in awhile).  Plan your lap accordingly unless you want to rebreak the pit.  <br><br>2.  The raid leader's only job should be to keep track of this time and the spawns ahead of him.  He and the puller should know the time remaining, and coordinate pulls so that you don't miss your window.  If you have to skip a few spawns, skip statics, NEVER SKIP WANDERING MOBS.  Pathing here can be odd, and you never know when something is going to aggro your camp as it wanders by.  <br><br>3. Designate an officer on the lap to handle loot allocation for drops.  This frees up the raid leader so he can watch the time, and allows him a share of the loot without appearing biased.  In the event that the loot officer can use a drop, you will have to work out your own strategy.  A vote by the other officers present and the raid leader is usually safe.  <br><br>4. I can't stress enough that your puller needs to stop far enough away from the party that the casters/clerics/backup healers and buffers can keep at least one wall or a corner between themselves and the mob.  Practice this on every mob, whether it AEs or not.  Forgetting to do that on even one AEing wurm can result in a nasty set of rezzes and a complete screw over on your timing.  <br><br>5. Feel free to experiment with multiple pullers if you have the confidence and are clearing relatively quickly.  Two will probably suffice, three is just showing off.  One puller will be more than enough on most of your laps, however.  If a puller begins screwing up, fire him/her and force them to play with the other tanks for a few minutes.  This usually knocks some sense back into them.  <br><br><br>Good luck in Halls of Testing.  Make sure your raid is flexible enough to modify these strategies as your own guild's composition/abilities allow.  Once you develop your own strategies for this area, this'll go from a scheduled raid to just one more thing you can do to kill time between 'real' raiding.<br><br>Zerlatik Flaimweaver<br>Surly Freelance lvl 57 Evoker of Tholuxe Paells <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm14.showPrevMessage?topicID=58.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm14.showNextMessage?topicID=58.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm14.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm14.emailToFriend?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm14.threadControl?topicID=58.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm14.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm14.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=58.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm30">Veeshan's Peak Key<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm31">Fusibility Research<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Luclin Spell Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Luclin Faction Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Luclin Quest Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Luclin Item Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm39">MOB Resistance Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm14>Skyshrine Armor</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
