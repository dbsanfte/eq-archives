As has been said yes, but not backed up, Gemlin has posted some good links. Go see the facts.<br>

Wait either guns are a threat or they are not. If they something one can only have 'false confidence' in, then why are they worthy of being controlled?<br>
<br>
The truth is guns work FINE. A automatic sidearm with 'safety rounds' hardly has to be aimed, even a paniced firing of a dozen rounds is very likely to have ONE hit which is all you need to knock an assailant down and for you to get away.<br>

Lol it wasn't just Germany. Gemlin listed SOME of the history of gun control. I suppose you think it is coincidence that populations with arms don't tend to get oppressed by their governments and that it was ones that were disarmed that were the subject of purges? Like I said how much fun would it be for the Chinese police to go and dissappear a dissident if they had to risk getting shot each time?<br>

     There are not enough hours in the day for me to even begin to argue with Mr. Lott's article.  I saw about 20 points that are fairly contestable, but I'm not spending the whole freakin day compiling stats.  I'll spend this time to focus on one area - his state by state comparison of crime rates.  His contention is that the &quot;grey&quot; states are the one's with the strongest Gun Control laws and a higher incidence of crime.  He also states that the &quot;white states,&quot; i.e., the ones with the least gun contro have lower crime rates.<br>
<br>
     Which brings me back to my original point about &quot;variables&quot; other than gun control.&quot;  The &quot;Grey&quot; states also are those with the biggest Urban areas and the highest concentrated population of those in poverty.  Consider that the following cities are in the Grey area:  NYC, Boston, Baltimore, Wash D.C., Detroit, Chicago (black on the chart), and L.A.  Urban areas, with high degrees of inner city poverty and violence.  Compare this with the &quot;white areas&quot; on the map, generally rural and less densely populated concentrations of poverty.  A variable independent of GC laws.<br>
<br>
    And thats just one point, there are plenty of others in that article which are constestable.   <p>Torcer Arcana - 60 Sorcerer - Brothers of Darkness - The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utorcerarcana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torcer Arcana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/11/02 9:42:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> &quot;However the point which you are using those facts to defend is that removing guns will make people safer, which the evidence of countries like the UK and Australia refute.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Faithkills, read my post again.  Did i ever , even once, state that removing guns will make people safer.  Did I ever, even once, advocate Gun Control.  NO!  I never did, so don't put words in my mouth.  For reasons I fail to grasp, you gun people seem to think that anyone challenging anything you say must mean we want to take away your guns.  I could care less, you can have a freakin M-16 for all I care.<br>
<br>
    As far as 1-4, you are right, they don't directly address the America/Europe comparison.  My research over the last few hours has shown me that the crime rates appear to be statistically even (within a Standard Deviation or 2) among these countries.  Which seems to indicate, to me, that the crime Rate is farily independent of the presence or lack of guns in a society.  Which shows the original point: More guns does not equal less crime.  Nor, does it equal more it seems.  <p>Torcer Arcana - 60 Sorcerer - Brothers of Darkness - The Nameless</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufaithkills.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faithkills</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Will Argue For Food</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/11/02 9:43:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> The Bill of Rights trumps the Supreme Court by definition.

Here we go: Berretta Model 92 used by the US Military as their primary sidearm, 9mm High Capacity Magazine(15 rounds).  High Capacity being defined as anything over 10.  I believe you Could find 20 round magazines for that particular weapon.  Also available for Civilian Purchase through normal channels(even the High Capacity magazines can still be purchased, Just not manufactured).  THIS is the Type of weapon he is talking about in his article.<br>
<br>
The M60 7.62mm machine gun is a lightweight, air-cooled, disintegrating metallic link-belt fed, portable or  tripod mounted machine gun with a cyclic firing rate of 550 rounds per minute.<br>
<br>
These are two entirely different classes of weapons so you quote from the article talking about how if a Person would have had a 15-20 round Semi-automatic Pistol they MAY have had a chance at coming out better(Note I said MAY as did the article), and now you claim he wants everybody to be carrying around 18 pound(not including amunition) Fully automatic Belt Fed weaponry?<br>
<br>
<br>
But please, answer just this One question, Why can't you own one if you want one?  Are you a criminal?  Are you Insane?  Do you have thoughts of hurting yourself And/Or others?  If the answer to all of those is NO then what is the problem with you owning this particular weapon?  Because you are afraid you MIGHT do something bad with it?  Has nothing to do the weapon.  If you mistrust yourself that much please seek professional help.  Or is it simply because NO one NEEDS it.  <br>
<br>
Well no one Needs alcohol either, you going to make that illegal too to protect me from myself?  Already happened didn't work.<br>

Why Eamin?  Would you share your reasonings with me?  And I don't mean quoting statistics off of webpages, share your personal Private reasonings.  As I am sure you are well aware statistics can be made to show whatever the author wishes them to.  Also as others have already pointed out there are to many variables just to start quoting statistics because they never get everything. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eaminwhitefalcon>Eamin Whitefalcon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>¡Viva la inquisición!</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/11/02 11:58:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://web.tampabay.rr.com/eqsite/Eamin_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guns (ot)</span><hr size=1> Melcar, there is no way in hell anyone could get me to drag statistics out on an issue as meaningless as this.<br>

My opinion is that the less guns there are, the less people will be killed.

1) There is no way to remove all guns.<br>
<br>
2) If you could, there would still be an entire world of weapon with which to cause mayhem, and thus having a gun to defend youself would be a good idea.<br>

There's no way to remove all crack, either, but we try.<br>

It's highly unlikely that your average crazed teen is going to be able to walk into school with a knife and cause mass destruction. Guns are the only thing that keeps things like this happening. Without guns, there would be no way to cause mass death, besides bombs and other explosives.<br>

This premise is faulty to begin with.  There are over 200 million firearms in the US (I think that also includes law enforcement and military as well).  But you cant use the argument &quot;if noone has a gun&quot;.  There will always be guns.  Its not that hard for someone to setup a machine shop and start building some.<br>
<br>
Add to the fact that even countries that ban guns from the civilians ALWAYS keep a standing military that has arms and often outfits law enforcement with arms.  One country that does that is China, a country with a pathetic human civil rights background.  In China, the people cant have guns.  But if they dare say anything against the government, a bunch of soldiers show up armed and take him off to jail.<br>
<br>
The real problem is that there are BAD people in this world.  Tell them they cant have guns, they will ignore you.  Take away their guns, they will find some on the black market.  They also have other methods for killing at their disposal such as knifes, bats, numbchucks, etc.<br>
<br>
Oh, and the horrible terroristic act of 9/11 was done without guns.  It was done with boxcutters.  <br>
<br>
If someone wants to do something bad, they will find a way to do it, with or without guns.<br>

To propound anything else would be idiotic.<br>
<br>
Apparently you haven't realized that there are almost as many guns in the US as people, according to your numbers. There is something wrong with this, either your facts or the nation.<br>
<br>
Horrible terrorist attack of September 11th was done without guns because guns are illegal in airports.<br>
<br>
The facts are:  if people don't have guns, they will not only be less able to cause mass death (there are exceptions, such as September 11th), but they will be far easier to stop while they are attempting to do what little killing is possible for them.<br>
<br>
Running around in a school nunchucking people to death takes a long, long time. The police will arrest him. A woman in a park being assaulted by rapists will be far more able to escape if the rapists don't have guns to shoot her with. And the rapists will be less likely to attack if they know that there is a chance that their victim can overpower them. If they have guns, their victim CAN'T overpower them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=221&stop=240>12</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=241&stop=260>13</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1035.topic&start=261&stop=271>14</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1035.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1035.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1035.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=1035.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=1035.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1035.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1035.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
