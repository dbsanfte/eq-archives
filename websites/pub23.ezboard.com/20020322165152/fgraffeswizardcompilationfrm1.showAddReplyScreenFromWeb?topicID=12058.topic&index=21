Always good to see that!<br>
<br>
I too have a list of those who have attempted to ruin the land of Norrath for me. I'm sure many others do to some degree or another as well. It was only about a half a year ago that I bothered to write down their offenses as well as putting them on my list. Now I can keep track of those who were either mildly annoying as well as those that truly deserved to find themselves in a &quot;bind point death loop&quot; at 4:30am.<br>
<br>
I feel a little better knowing that I'll never help those one or two complete arseholes... but oh it would be so much more grand if every Wizard they ran into snubbed them as well. In fact, why stop at Wizards. Why not include Clerics, Druids, -- heck every class!<br>
<br>
But I see two problems: How do you make sure you don't include someone who deserves to be in THE LIST from being a part of your secret society? And how do you make sure new additions to THE LIST truly deserve to be on said list?<br>
<br>
As an officer of a guild I've had ocassions where an outsider has accused a guild member of doing something so drastic that they should be deguilded. After speaking with the guild member in question, their side of the story makes it seem as if the other person was the instigator. It came down to one person's word over another. My point is that it takes an extreme amount of trust/faith or investigation to determine who was wrong.<br>
<br>
And then where do you draw the line for entry onto THE LIST? For each individual it is clear since you are your own jury. Do you put someone on a list if they lie? Do you put someone on the list if they threaten to kill steal you? What about someone who is just plain rude? At what point does the insults and foul language cross the line?<br>
<br>
As a Wizard of C-T I find the idea incredibly interesting, but the potential for abuse and wrongful additions to THE LIST seem too great to risk. Something like this would probably work well in a very small trusted group of friends, but once it grows too big you'll spend your entire day acting as judge and jury.<br>
<br>
I'd much rather see a list of people that are worthwhile to get to know better. I have a list of really good friends: I known them in RL, many hours of time spent with in Norrath, or just because of some extremely abnormal out-of-the-way acts of pure kindness.<br>
<br>
I'd much rather know who your really trusted, close, treasured, friends are. Then I can go out of my way to help them instead of going out of my way not to help some immature jerk. <p>--<br>

Didn't even know he played this game till Grumpyleaf (another old-timer long RL friend) passed me his name<br>
<br>
My method of keeping out the bad people<br>
--Only wizards need &quot;apply&quot; to our secret society. Gives us a brother/sisterhood feeling, we know each other from graffe and from quadding.<br>
Well..and a certain shaman who suddenly raises prices on potions to 3x the normal when facing members on the list<br>
(and gives a 10-50% discount to the people I send his way..works both ways)<br>
Yes, there is possibility for abuse on the &quot;Well...I said that he did this..I demand retribution&quot;...however, the people that I pick and choose to be within my selection of people are people I've known for months and I trust in their honour and integrity. After all, they're aggreeing to snub entire guilds from lining their own pockets.<br>
At that point, its all trust that I've done my homework on a guild or a person before rendering the decision to add to list.<br>
<br>
In the end, its all a game, and seeing what we can do with a game. Its always been my belief that your reputation carries you far, the list is a way of showing this to an extreme. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulysandor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lysandor</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.dmki.tv/omani.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/25/02 3:45:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12058.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.dmki.tv/derek3_small1.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wiz Lists</span><hr size=1> I am in agreement with this sort of thing - to a point.<br>
<br>
But I too fear abuse of the power, as I have seen it first hand, so I dont really keep a list. I do **remember** folks that are total asses though; one of the benifits of having a near photographic memory.<br>
<br>
The people on my head list are usually such assholes that **everyone** knows about them anyway, so there is little need to spread the word.<br>
<br>
I have only had two episodes in 51 levels where I felt truly wronged by a port requester. <br>
<br>
1) Around level 30 a guy offered me some plat for an NK trip. Then berated me in /ooc for actually accepting his donation. I haven't seen him in 20 + levels though, so I assume he either got bored with that toon and rolled a new one, or quit altogether. Chances are he was too stupid to get past 35 regardless.<br>
<br>
2) Had a guy pick a fight with me in /occ because he felt all ports should be **free**, as it &quot;is only manna&quot;. I told him he was mistaken; in actuality - it is **only** time. My time, and I will charge or not charge as I see fit. BTW: I never advertise my porting services for X plat. I think its crass, and druidic to do so. Anyway - he bitched me out in /ooc for my &quot;greedy&quot; ways, and before I could reply - 3 total strangers chimed in and basically told him to go flux himself. never saw him again either...<br>
<br>
Bottom line: I port when I want to port, and I accept donations or not as I see fit. Anyone who doesn't like it can take the bus, period.<br>
<br>
Now - as to the original question: Do I keep a list of folks that I will invite, and then port exile to HATE? Of course not. That is a suspendable / banable offense on most servers (I dont know about Sullon Zek.)<br>
<br>
Which brings me to:<br>

Amen to that my friend! I personally dont have the time to play these kind of games. Anytime I am not grouped with guildies / friends in dungeons, I am kiting / quad kiting. I have better things to do with my time then play politics or be a private investigator. My standard response to people I dislike when they /tell me for a port / TL?<br>
<br>
NO.<br>
<br>
Of course, thats also what I tell people when I am too busy, as well - so it may be hard to tell what I think of you, just by asking me for a TL to bind.<br>
