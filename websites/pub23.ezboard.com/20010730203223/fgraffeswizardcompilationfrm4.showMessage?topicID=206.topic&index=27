I can understand where you are coming from in the camp of saying, &quot;if you don't like the class - play another one!&quot;<br>
<br>
That is a nice statement, but I think you are missing the point. It is easy to flip out a simple statement like that.<br>
<br>
I cannot speak for anyone else but myself. I started my Wizzie before Kunark and Velious. At 49, IC was the shit back then! I struggled, I played, I put up with our strengths and weaknesses just like every other Wizard before me. I think that it is important to respect folks that at least make it to 50 and not to disregard them as incompetent people. Heck - any class that can make it to 50 is an achievement.<br>
<br>
But to have come this far, only to have the game changed mid-stream so that to progress further in the Wizard class means that I have to be in an UBER/large guild, I think is asking quite a bit from those that have invested their heart and soul and time playing their class. We are talking a very large time investment. Everyone knows this.<br>
<br>
I love my Wizard. Even when I am playing my Warrior and my Cleric, I am thinking of my Wizard. hehehe  My Cleric roots and toots and surprises quite a bit of folks as I know from playing my Wizard what effective crowd control is.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The game should not restrict any class potential to only UBER/large guilds. If we continue down this road, yes, only the UBER/large guilds will retain Wizards. As only they have the resources. And only they will be the players having Wizards are their secondaries, as they know all to well what is needed to support one.<br>
<br>
Is that a game that you feel is balanced? Maybe, because you are probably in one of those guilds.<br>
<br>
In all honesty - what do you care about the class or other players? I may be reading more into your posting that is there, but it appears that if everything is fine with your game, other people can just play another class if they do not like it. <br>
<br>
It is the truth - isn't it? Let's be honest now.<br>
<br>
I think most of what people want is to be able to play the class that they love and to enjoy the game regardless of what guild they are in or how many trinkets thay have. To be valued in groups and to play an integral part in a team of players. <br>
<br>
We may not be the biggest damage dealers in game. I can accept that - no problem. No superior ego here. I just want to be able to play, have fun, contribute, and be recognized for the skill and ability I have in playing my class. A team player. I don't care how it is achieved: new spells, better mana ratios, better mana regen, whatever.<br>
<br>
EQ is a group game, so I want to play in groups. Besides - it is more fun meeting folks and sharing experiences. <br>
<br>
I don't want to have to resort to playing a class that I really am not interested in playing only to be able to enjoy the game post 50 in and shape or form. This is what it is now for me. I have to play my Warrior just to enjoy the game for what it is, because the Wizard class has not been upgraded along with the game. <br>
<br>
Is that my fault? Is that because my skills at playing my class are less than competent? <br>
<br>
Um... no. The game dynamics changed from VI, and it is taking them forever to notice that folks without resources cannot aspire to do anything post 50 - irregardless of class. <br>
<br>
To me - a game designed like that is not &quot;fixed&quot;, it is broken if it forces people to play something they do not want to only to have the opportunity to succeed irregardless of time spent online, guilds, or equipment. <p>Aziz Al'Qadir
