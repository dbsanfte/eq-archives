Here are my thoughts on all that has been brought up thus far.<br>
<br>
In the opening of this thread, Hareq brought to light two concerns. One, a specific occurrence of a conflict in game, and two a broad generalization of the atttitude he was feeling in the SGA at this time. Subsequent posters have addressed other concerns. What will I address in this post?<br>
<br>
1) Icewell incident<br>
2) SGA attitudes<br>
3) Inviting other guilds to raids<br>
4) Inviting other guilds to join the SGA<br>
5) The Charter<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, now that the mumbo jumbo of a specific agenda is layed out, let me put a little passion into these responses. Holt, you say these posts disturb you because they show we are not displaying the unity we should? I look at it differently. These posts excite me. Look at how many people care about doing this thing right. Look at all the passion in every post concerning our organization. The SGA is a very large alliance, with ALOT of different types of people from different backgrounds and countries. To see everyone discussing the SGA in this manner on this thread shows strength, not disunity.<br>
<br>
1) Icewell incident - This type of thing happens all the time in this game, misunderstanding, miscommunication. It will be the goal of the SGA to limit this occurrence as much as possible. To minimize any misunderstandings the charter loot rules will be laid out in a more specific manner. This has already been stated but here is the jist of what the addendum will state - <br>
<br>
All SGA, NBG, if no one needs, /random. 2) SGA/non-SGA mix, NBG, if no one needs /random. There are no SGA &quot;guild coffers&quot;. If you win a piece of equipment you cannot use, and would like to donate it to a worthy member that is your perogative. Raid loot rules will be established by the raid leader. They will adhere to the basic principles of NBG, but may vary depending on the leader and the circumstances.<br>
<br>
This was an unfortunate incident. To state for the record, if you as an SGA member recieves a complaint about one of our members you should immediately contact either myself in game or one of the guild's officers to handle the situation. Allowing this to go on for several weeks and then posting on the public boards does not do anything to solve bitterness that can arise during these conflicts. As officers of the respective guilds we have all had experience first hand with working these dilemmas out. So, contact one ASAP if there is ANY kind of dispute.<br>
<br>
2) SGA Attitudes - Read our charter and our mission statement. If that is not what you want, perhaps this is not the organization for you. I'm going to put some logistics on this. An SGA lead raid should be comprised of 2 types of players.... SGA and FRIENDS of the SGA. That is VERY VERY simple. That is our distinction between an open raid and an SGA raid. The raid leader/organizer will have FULL discretion regarding his raid. It is very important for the leader to post the number of people max and min that can attend and how they are to be selected. (A good example of this is the current Hate raid plans). As a raid leader it is your responsiblity to make this clear to all involved well before the raid. If your plans are laid down clear and upfront there will be little room for bitterness or complaints.<br>
<br>
I think this notion of &quot;uber&quot; guild mentalities is silly. If you think this, you should reread the mission, and perhaps you have the wrong idea of the SGA. Now let's make another distinction. Elitist mentalities and pride of being an SGA member. This is a fine line and depending on your perspective can be viewed differently. I want all members to have pride to belong to this organzition, I want no members to treat non members any less for the tag on their name (or lack of one). Again, if you see this happening, CONTACT myself or an officer of any of the guilds. You would not allow this to take place in your own guilds, DO NOT allow it to take place in this organization.<br>
<br>
In these posts there have been several outright misrepresentations. I cannot recall one raid where the loot rules for non SGA members were any different than the members. I think alot of you looked at that first incident (which was a pickup group, not a raid, and was a misunderstanding). Please do not put the SGA in this light based on one posted incident. We have NEVER run a raid on these policies and we NEVER will.<br>
<br>
3) Simple policy. SGA and friends of the SGA. Sign up on the boards for raids, talk to your raid leaders, point your friends to our boards to post, do whatever you can do to allow the raid leader the information about who will be joining.<br>
<br>
4) The next person that says &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; I'm going to hunt down in game and slap. Those posts were months ago, just as we had joined PoJ and SF. It was the voice of ALL people that voiced at that time that we wanted to join new guilds but this was not a good time as we hadn't even run a raid with PoJ and SF. Those posts were a courtesy to the guilds posting, and is what the officers decided to do at that time for the above reasons. It annoys me (especially since I was the one that posted those after the threads sat unresponded to for days, and no I didn't have any official responsiblity to post I felt the guilds deserved a response on why we weren't adding) that you look back several months and all of a sudden have a problem with that. I do believe now is a good time to add new guilds, I do not believe at the time of those posts that it was a good time. Apparently no one else reading these boards then had a problem with it as there was no posts stating so then.<br>
<br>
That said, the officers have been talking about how to select new guilds for the alliance and when for about a week. The process is being worked out. Feel free to post any input as it would be much appreciated.<br>
<br>
5) I am working on a Charter revision that I will post for your approval. Several areas will be more specific as we have now had several months to see how the guilds work together and the types of issues that arise.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I really feel this is a great organization. Do not bail at the first sign of adversity. We are taking a long hard road to stick with the friends we have made in this game all the way to 60. It is difficult to maintain an organization of this size and keep everyone happy outside and inside 100% of the time. As more guilds are added, the challenge will become even tougher. Look at these posts and see strength not weakness, and walk away proud to belong to an organization with this many great people.<br>
<br>
As usual, thanks for reading all that nonsense, there was a lot I wanted to get posted. I look forward to your responses.<br>
