<br>
The waves lapped against the shore.  An elf stood upon a dune in the Oasis of Marr.  His robe flapped in the breeze.  The sky was all blue, not one cloud offered shade from the scorching heat.  At the bottom of the dune were a various<br>
collection of races, hunting orcs and wild animals.  Off in the distance, there would be a flare of magic as a the spectre did battle with a mortal.  The elf smiled and walked down the dune.  His foot prints were quickly covered by blown sand.  His wanders brought him to the docks.  There had been quickly put together with the discovery of Kunark, and the creaking they made when walked upon was evidence of it.  There were a few holes where the wood had given way.  There were numerous people on it, and the loud creaking that the wood was giving as the waves crashed into it suggested the docks weren't designed to hold so many people at once.  The elf smiled.  Life was good at the moment and that's all that mattered.<br>
<br>
Away from the docks, the sound of marching echoed off the mountain sides.  Wielding weapons of a war, an army green-skinned trolls marched into the Oasis.  Their shouts of war could be heard from a distance as they marched toward Freeport.  As the army descended upon the Oasis, it slowly broke into a run.  War cries could be heard as they engaged the other races who had made the Oasis home for their own reasons.<br>
<br>
The elf frowned as the trolls rushed over the dune, pushing back a variety of races that had allied themselves.  A warhammer flew by the elf, his hair rushing backwards as a gust of wind followed the hammer.  The elf pondered what to do, but before he could come to a conclusion, the lines of the allied races had been farther north.  A ring trolls now encompassed him.  He frowned as he smelled the stench of their breath.  Easily, it was not the most pleasent thing he had ever smelled.  A troll said something in common, something the elf couldn't understand.  The troll repeated his message again.  The elf didn't respond.  He just stood gazing into the eyes of the troll that spoke.  The tension in the air grew.  The troll howled a war cry and charged the elf.  The sword came crashing down upon the elf and broke in two.  The elf's skin shimmered as protective magics absorbed the blow.  The elf arched an eyebrow as another troll broke its weapon on the protective spell.  The elf's eye blazed with fire and he smiled slightly.<br>
<br>
&quot;Foolish trolls! You dare challenge an evoker?&quot; the elf roared.  The ground crackled with energy as lightning surged outward from the elf.  &quot;Behold, the fate of all those who defy the magics!&quot;  The oppressive heat vanished as a cool breeze picked up and increased to an artic gust.  The wizard held his palm upward and a ball of water gathered and froze into ice.  The trolls that survived the initial retaliation by the wizard slowly backed up.  The wizard brought his palm downward and the ball lept outward into the force of the trolls.  A wave of ice followed the ball, cracking the earth as it strained to cope with the sudden change in temperature.  The trolls scattered, fell, and their bodies were frozen as the ball of ice slammed into the middle of their formation.  The wind departed and the heat returned.  The elf sighed with remorse over what he had just done.  He had hoped to avoid conflict.  He looked down at the charred and frozen bodies and gave another sigh as magics engulfed him and took him away from Oasis.<br>
