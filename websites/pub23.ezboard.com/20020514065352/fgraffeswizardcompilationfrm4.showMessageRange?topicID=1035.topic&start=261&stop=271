Look you keep trying to say I am asserting something I am not, I am not drawing any conclusions based on this that gun control caused an increase in armed robbery, although it looks that way.<br>
<br>
What I AM saying is that gun control CLEARLY did not have any positive affect on it.. so why do it?<br>

First while your first syllogism is unimpeachable, the antecedent has NEVER been possible.<br>
<br>
And your second one does not follow from the first, and neglects the likelihood (which has been shown to be true historically) that if there are less guns they will find their way into the hands of the people who have the strongest desire to have them.<br>
<br>
THOSE people are probably not the ones you want to control the majority of the guns.<br>

Anyway again I don't need to prove gun control causes armed robbery (even though thats what the data shows) all I have to do is point out it doesn't do anything to stop it.<br>

Amen, brother. If in the course of an unrelated investigation, police should find a firearm in storage that belongs to you that does NOT have a child lock on it the offender should be charged with a Class III mistomeanor.

<br>
It's amazing how your logic works.<br>
<br>
From Faithkill:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

It seems you might have forgot what you have said.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raw Data and Rates.<br>
<br>
What do you mean by raw data here? The actual number instead of rates? Why would anyone want to use the actually number when quoting a statistic? Unless of course, you want to influence the outlook of the data?<br>
<br>
Here is an example:<br>
In the massacre that caused the Australian gun ban, 35 people died in the state of Tasmania. The rate of homicide for the state of Tasmania jumped from 1.1 in 1994-95 to 8.4 in 1995-96. <br>
<br>
Am I going to quote the NUMBER which jumped from about 6 to 40 and claim that because of the abundance of guns, the homicide for Tasmania increased 600%? (Notice the figures are estimates calculated from rates, because for some reason I can't find any official website that would quote the actuall number.)<br>
<br>
How idiotic would that claim be? But that's pretty similar to the claim about Australia.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

You know, a few years ago Quake 2 was a great, fun game.  We had LAN parties at convention centers where we'd get together and play.  A good friend of mine was one of the top 100 Q2 players in the world based on online rankings.  But he'd go to these things, do very well, and occasionally get fragged.  It got to the point where he would be winning a level, get killed, then actually leave the convention.  We once had a LAN party at his house and he even left there because he was angry.  Nobody likes playing with a bad sport, and we eventually stopped inviting him.<br>

<br>
&quot;You are why Al Gore isn't in the White House,&quot; NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre told more than 4,500 delegates at the NRA's 131st annual meeting. <br>
<br>
&quot;No other group could have done what we did collectively in 2000, and now it's time to finish the job,&quot; NRA lobbyist James Jay Baker said. &quot;The Senate is the hole in our armor. ... The Senate is our battleground.&quot; <br>
<br>
Georgia Sen. Zell Miller, the first Democrat to give the NRA's keynote address in more than a decade, agreed that Gore's stands on gun rights cost him key states, including Arkansas, West Virginia and Tennessee. <br>
<br>
&quot;I recall the surprise of national Democratic leaders at losing those states in the presidential election,&quot; Miller, a longtime NRA member, said in a speech to more than 2,000 members at Saturday night's banquet. <br>
<br>
&quot;All their expert pollsters said voters favored some kind of gun control. ... Well, I stand with heartfelt conviction over a political wind gauge any day. <br>
<br>
&quot;Like many of you, I've got more guns than I need, but not as many as I want... There is nowhere I'd rather be tonight than right here with you, on the picket line of freedom's defense,&quot; he said to loud applause. <br>
<br>
NRA President Charlton Heston narrated an eight-minute videotape on Ronald Reagan -- who in 1983 became the first sitting president to address an NRA convention -- before he told the cheering crowd he would grant their wish to stay on for an unprecedented fifth term. <br>
<br>
&quot;After all we did in the 2000 elections, I think we deserve a personal visit from President Bush next year, don't you?&quot; Heston said. The 78-year-old actor then held up an 1874 rifle and reprised a signature line: &quot;From my cold dead hands.&quot; <br>
<br>
The crown booed the mention of Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, lead sponsor of the campaign finance reforms that the NRA is challenging. <br>
<br>
LaPierre said the group &quot;must grow larger and tougher&quot; to fend off attempts to implement waiting periods on gun purchases at gun shows, protect gun manufacturers from lawsuits and defend First Amendment freedom of speech in the form of campaign advertising. <br>
<br>
LaPierre said those who would restrict gun rights are engaged in &quot;political terrorism.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It's a far greater threat to freedom than any foreign force,&quot; he said. <br>
<br>
Leaders also took aim at anti-gun groups they say operate under the banner of &quot;gun safety.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We invented gun safety,&quot; said Craig Sandler, NRA director of general operations. &quot;What does the Violence Policy Center know or do about gun safety? ... What does the Million Mom March know or do about gun safety?&quot; <br>
<br>
Rocker Ted Nugent was helping with recruitment at the Reno-Sparks Convention Center, where as many as 35,000 people were expected to visit by the time the convention concludes Monday. <br>
<br>
&quot;If you are not a member of the NRA, you really aren't performing your 'we-the-people duty' in this nation,&quot; said Nugent, a hunting enthusiast and NRA board member.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

Interesting.  I liked the attempt to try to use 9/11 to promote their agenda.  This quote:<br>
