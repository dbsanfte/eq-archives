Wizard soloing sucks.  At least it sucks pre-29, can't speak about after that though.<br>
<br>
Level 16 wizard, in the Overthere, on the &quot;easy&quot; side.<br>
<br>
1.) Walk out and find a likely target.<br>
2.) Cast bolt spell<br>
3.) Start spamming root, pray to Solusek it holds<br>
4.) Nuke until dead<br>
5.) DOH root broke, if lucky and it doesn't, go to #9<br>
6.) Take 75% of life in damage rerooting the fugger<br>
7.) Back away<br>
8.) Finish nuking till its dead<br>
9.) Loot<br>
10.) Limp back to OT<br>
11.) Med for 5-7 minutes to get FOM again<br>
12.) If root broke wait another 5 minutes to finish healing.<br>
13.) Repeat<br>
<br>
Mad, insane, ridiculous downtime!  Other option is to deal with the....charming....individuals in either Oasis or Highpass Hold (no loot for YOU!).  I don't want to be one of those &quot;crack beggars&quot; pestering random enchanters for breeze/clarity, but its getting pretty bad.  <br>

I had the same when my wizard hit level 15 or so.<br>
Situation is a bit easier once you get self ports, so you have more options where to look for groups.<br>
I did cheat a bit at the point and brought my at the time level 50 druid with my wizard to unrest.<br>
That was where i learned about the power of our AE spells.<br>
Was good for defense, offense, channeling skill as well (not to mention weapon skill.<br>
At 20 i left and didnt have much problems getting groups when i was looking (i usually get the wiz out if i am not playing long periods or have to go afk pretty often).<br>
Wizard is level 23 now and slowly rising (getting main to 60 is priority at this point) <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65418>Gnomb Goodbasher level 59 troll warrior</a>

This sounds like you are implying I am anti-group.  I'm not.  I'm anti-loot-whore, and anti-idiot, both of which are well over-represented in lowbie groups.  I've been in some very good lowbie groups, and have definitely enjoyed the experience.  I prefer grouping generally, since it tremendously reduces downtime.<br>
<br>
I also like to think that having a cleric main has given me some good skills in mana and aggro management.  I know how to properly use aoe spells without getting smeered, I don't run around like a chicked with my head cut off when I accidentally get aggro and a mob is beating on me screaming &quot;get it off.&quot;  Of course, I've also died because idiots tanks in my group are too busy watching the nifty damage they are doing and are not paying attention to caster health bars.  I even know how to use aoe nukes without getting eaten <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The majority of lowbie groups I've been in have had people that I've had to ask not to loot the bodies before they hit the ground (what?  autosplit not good enough for ya!?!), thought that imbibing alcohol made their mana come back faster (10 minute discussion where I had to explain that 10/100 = 10% and 10/50 = 20% and that 20% in this case wasn't more than 10%...), and so on.  Its when I get my fill of that, that I solo (something that I couldn't ever really do as a cleric) and its the downtime associated with soloing that I'm ranting about (and again, I know yall have all been there, I'm not saying &quot;oh woe is me&quot;.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Is this your first character on that server? Meaning, no PP backup for gear? or help from others that know your alt?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Nope.  Not my first at all.  My main is a 52 cleric and is an awesome guild.  Its just that my main is normally perma-broke (don't charge for rezzes and don't accept donations combined with buying peridots and trying to save up for a faithstone.../sigh) and so using him as a &quot;sugar daddy&quot; doesn't really work well.  Character is mildly twinked with an oracle robe and stein of moggok for whatever its worth.<br>
<br>
I am very reluctant to pester my higher level enchanter friends for &quot;crack.&quot;  Most of the time they aren't anywhere near where I am levelling anyway, and I respect that they are busy doing their own thing.  If I see an enchanter in-zone that I know, I'll ask them if they can spare a &quot;hit&quot;, but thats about it.  I can't stand buff-beggars as a cleric, and I'm be thrice-d*mn*d before I become one myself.<br>

Seriously.  I buy a KEI when i solo and it really takes the pain out of it, it is worth the price, and since i'm paying for it, i don't feel bad about auctioning for it.  You could probably get by with clarity at your level, and the price for that is much cheaper, but with KEI at your level, you'd feel like a demigod.<br>
<br>
Next, drive your wizzie over to OOT and camp the AC with your cleric (and melee friend if need be) and get jboots.  Or buy SoW potions.  Then pick on the slow moving mobs like cacti, and you should be able to stay out of range when rerooting them.  Life gets much better at 29 once you can snare, and at 34 you get Circle of Force, (first really good quad kiting spell) and lookout!  Make sure you get your staff of temperate flux for pulling when you are ready to start quadding.<br>
<br>
I really wish i had learned to quad sooner.  Since i finally picked it up, my levels have flown by.  Groups are fun when you get bored of soloing, but quadding is an awesome way to get your xp bar moving to the right.  Being a low level wizard is hard.  Really hard.  Once you get around 35 it starts to become easier, and about 51 it becomes pretty enjoyable.  The thing with wizards is that you are very weak at low levels and become very powerful at 60.  It's a long hard road...  and probably as it should be to prevent too many high level wizards, but as you get closer to that magic level 60, it will get easier. <p>Luxum Aeturnum {Cestus Dei}<BR>

<br>
Seems The Necro with pet functioned very well at 60% mana and pet at full health.  2 dots and 1 lifetap type spell and I sat and enjoyed the show.  No running, no worries, just beating a mobs ass each and every time with no damage taken.<br>
<br>
My wizard on the other hand, my true love as an EQ player.  I get my ass handed to me when soloing.  I always normally use up all my mana in 2 kills on the high end of OT, of course unless I am in a group.  Plus takes forever to get my mana back.  This being my main complaint.<br>

Yep, this is why necros rock soloing.  It would be nice if there were more FT or mana efficiency items in the game.  If it takes me 50% less mana to blast something to smithereens, thats just as good as 100% improvement on mana regen.<br>

However, I've decided I'm going to take my wizzie out of the OT and try to find a group in HHP, failing that, keep running until I get to the NK spires (invis is your friend!) and try Paludal.

Try having no pet to sink your aggro into at all.  Try having next to no mana regen.  Try having no way to heal yourself beyond bandaids.  Try having only an AOE snare, and try waiting 29 levels before you get it, and in the meantime having to rely on the dubious safety of root which rarely holds longer than one nuke.  Try being a specialized nuker who is matched or even surpassed in your field of specialization at some levels by more versatile classes.<br>

Well personally i think the problem is either you spent so much time soloing that you aren't adapted to grouping, or else you were in the world's shittiest group last night.  Yeh soloing is better xp.  But socialization is one of the key features of a MMORPG and you are missing out if soloing is all you ever do.  Unfortunately there are a lot of necros that don't know how to use their grouping tools, and that has caused a lot of prejudice against them, and it's probably difficult to get a pickup group with a nec.  Kinda like overnuking wizards who never learned to control aggro because they were always going balls-to-the-wall when soloing.<br>

re: Necromancers<br>
<br>
In my experience Necromancers can be tremendous assets to xp groups and to raids.  Its just a matter of changing strategies.  In most raids I'm the cheal b*tch, with druids doing most of the patch and caster healing.  A trained monkey could probably do my job in a raid in most cases.  Raids are not about personal fun or glory, its all about the team and getting loot.  The necromancers in my guild are excellent raiders because they understand this and adapt their techniques accordingly.   Twitching may not be glamorous, but if it keeps the clerics in enough mana to keep the MA alive which prevents a wipeout, then they have performed a vital task for the raid.  Higher level necromancers have used mana-sieve spells to help keep &quot;group nukem&quot; supplied with power to nuke the mobs harder and longer.  And when deemed safe, necro pets are excellent additions to DPS.<br>

And don't bother Druid for SoW. Druid SoW sucks ass and I tell ya why.<br>
SoW potions fade for about 10 secs before the buff is gone, leaving you enough time to cover enough distance to drink the next potion when you finaly slow down. Druid/Shaman SoW just fades and BAMM you are dead.<br>
Invest the 110pp in a 10 stack SoW potion and some more cash in KEI. The downside is: I have never played again without KEI. I simply can't. It's boring, it's slow, it's no fun. <p>---

____________________________________________________<br>
<br>
Ok, Reasoned reply &amp; NO RANT (you deserve a reasoned reply):<br>
<br>
1. Necromancers have a AMAZING amount of Abilities. No question here. However, you need to understand something about the Necromancer Spell Lines:<br>
<br>
ALMOST ALL NECROMATIC MAGIC CAUSES HARM.<br>
<br>
However, the last few times I've Getto Healed I've been told to &quot;STOP THAT! I want a REAL Heal from a Cleric!&quot;. Stupid move by the other Player? No Question about that but after it occurs a few times you get the Message. Since a Necromancer's Getto Heal is NOT a True Heal but a TRANSFER of my HP/Life Force from me to you, I quickly start asking if YOU (the other Party Member) are worth killing myself over.<br>
<br>
2. Charm = Undead, only. Unless my Party is in Kit Forest at night or, say Lower Guk it's pretty useless. Alot or Necro Spells are like that. They LOOK GREAT on paper but are pretty useless  90% of the time.<br>
<br>
3. MEZ: ST = Works but is Heavly resisted &amp; and the PARTY (even though you SCREAM you head off not to WACK the MOB) WACKS the WRONG MOB. I certainly respect Enchanters over this one. 10% Mez the MOB &amp; 90% keep your party from wacking the WRONG MOB.<br>
<br>
4. TWITCHING: Remember our History with Verant. I have Subversion in my Book. I've never TWITCHED in 3.5 years &amp; I never will. The Spell Line has a HORRID Conversion Rate &amp; use of is still to this day (for some Necromancers) Grounds for Killing the Offending Necromancer &amp; his/her Party in any way possible. You may know Necromancers who TWITCH on Raides but trust me on this one, THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT outside the Guild Proper. TWITCHBITCH is without a doubt the WORST thing you can call a Necromancer. Even on the Necromancer Board, Twitchers are viewed as on par with Child Molesters. This isn't just me. Check my Class Board Archives. You would NEVER believer the Flame Wars over this. You'ed have to see it with your own eyes.<br>
<br>
5. DOT Stacking: Do I want it? No Contest. Will we ever get it? I believe NOT.<br>
<br>
WHY?: A bit of Necro History:<br>
<br>
Pre-Kunark Zrattz lead 5 (ONLY) Necromancers on a Raid of the Plane of Air. This was the Necro Death Squad. The NDS ****CLEARED**** PoA to Island 4. Give us DOT Stacking &amp; with our restored Pets we would again be the single Greatest Killers in EQ. This is the reason Verant tried to kill my Class for 2 solid years. Failed didn't they? And we know how to wait.<br>
<br>
6. Groups &amp; Necro's: A Necromancer's greatest ADVANTAGE is a Timed Ambush. Indoors. A good Necro is thoughtful. Picks his/her place &amp; times the spawn. Kills off the MOBS &amp; times the respawn. Why do you think you can actually walk into the King Room in Guk &amp; find a single Necromancer Camping it?<br>
<br>
Groups want to go SCREAMING down a Hill WACKING Everything in Sight!<br>
<br>
We're known as Farmers. There's a Reason. But at the End of the Day I might Bank 10,000 PP (Example not Bragging) but SOLOING is BORING AS HELL!<br>

Reply  Re: Classes that make the difference in raiding?<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Beastlords actually have a really sweet buff at 59-60 (I forget which). But there's only like one 60 beastlord in existence, I think he was a bet. Just pretend they don't exist, it's more fun that way. Cracks me up watching them trying to explain their class at every raid. Accuse them of making stuff up for a real hoot.<br>
<br>
Warriors are needed, unless your monks are bored. But, even if they aren't, you only need like 3-4. The others just show up to get loot, greedy bastards.<br>
<br>
Clerics are needed, but I don't think they exist anymore. Real clerics, I mean. The ranger slapping a CH hotkey on a 2nd computer doesn't count.<br>
<br>
Enchanters are needed. They're needed for tash, mana regen, haste, (unless you have more than one shaman; then the 2nd shaman will have something to do!) and needed for mez/charm. Unless, of course, you have a lot of those shifty warrior-types, then you can just have them tanks the extra crap. If you're a real sadist, you can have them beg the 2-boxing ranger for a heal. Rangers don't seem to forget getting snubbed for a group when they were 20.<br>
<br>
Monks are needed. Monk FD is sweet, monk damage is sweet, and monk defense is also sweet. Sweetest of all is giggling like a schoolgirl when you see: xxxx has fallen to the ground. xxxx tells the group 'ass.' xxxx has been slain by a screamin_meanie!<br>
<br>
Mages are needed. DS, CoH, and least we forget it, those yummy mod rods. Pets aren't bad either. Not sure about their DD.<br>
<br>
Shaman are needed. Well, one is. It's not bad if they have Torpor, but I wouldn't ask them directly if they have it. You might loose a finger. I did.<br>
<br>
Necros aren't really needed. If you have some, try not to get more than 2. Necro one will gloat a lot and spout off how much damage he's doing. Necro two will kinda sigh and not really talk about how much damage he's doing. Necro 3+ will be soloing quietly off in the corner. If you want to have to &quot;twitch&quot; people, I would group them with casters and make sure there's a mob with mana around for them to mind wrack. If you want them to do the direct &quot;Twitch&quot; spell, forget it unless they offer. They can also do some really unique pulls.<br>
<br>
Wizards are either not very needed, or very very needed, depending on the target and expansion. There are some older content mobs that were pretty much immune to wizards, sadly. Luckily, those are disappearing, and in SoL it's a wizi playground. Either way, the best thing about wizards is they stack. You can *never* have too many wizards. If they have epic, you won't even have to heal 'em. Can't beat free damage, and tons of it. Can be habitual AFK'ers, keep an eye on 'em and send them random tells about kittens.<br>
<br>
Rogues are like wizards, but you also need one for locked doors/traps. Yeah, bards can do that, but they're sorta flighty and get distracted easy. Rogue damage stacks pretty well, but not as well as wizards (mob A's ass is only so big). Best part about rogues is unlike wizards, you can prevent the rogues from stealing XP. Just have the tank switch sides when the mob enrages. I would log the following guildchat, it'll be priceless.<br>
<br>
Bards are nice. They're usually mean and not very fluffy =\. They're needed for some things, and the rest of the time are total DT magnets, so it's fun to take them to places like PoA.<br>
<br>
Druids can kick ass, or really, really suck. They get points off for the high number of assling druids. Well played druids, while not needed, can replace and support many of the 'needed' classes. Poorly played druids like shifty warrior-types, but without all the armor and hitpoints.<br>
<br>
Paladins are very very very not needed. When they ask to come along, ask if they have their summoned horse yet. If they don't, laugh at them and put them on ignore. If they do, laugh at them and put them on ignore. Sure, they'll try to convince you they don't suck anymore, but they're lying. Ignore any so-called 'facts' or parsed logs showing them out-damaging the shifty-warrior types. No, I have no axe to grind. Really.<br>
<br>
Shadowknights aren't really *needed*, but they're nice. Nice aggro, can fill in for monks on FD pulls. Decent damage. Beware of the ones that 'roleplay'.<br>
<br>
Rangers with lots of AA are scary. You'll know which ones have lots of AAs because all the wizards keep giving them dirty looks. Ones without lots of AAs are really nice.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, that's my incredibly fair and un-biased assessment. Pretty much any class is great to have, other than a paladin. Or, any assling, regardless of class.<br>
