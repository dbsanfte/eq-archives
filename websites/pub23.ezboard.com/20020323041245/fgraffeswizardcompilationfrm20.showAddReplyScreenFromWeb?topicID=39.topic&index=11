  I kite on the small island all the time.  I grab the three static spawns (2 raptors, 1 vicious raptor) on the north side plus the wanderer.<br>
<br>
Give me a tell sometime when I'm on, and I'll show you what I do.<br>
<br>
Here is my general method:<br>
<br>
I sit over the water, north of the vicious raptor spawn, using levitate.  I have a FB earring, in case lev drops while medding.  I do this so I can watch the wanderer approach.  He's the signal to start the pull.<br>
<br>
I keep Shield of the Magi and a 'skin up, in addition to levitate and Tboots.  Refresh levitate and Tboots after every pull.<br>
<br>
When the wanderer starts coming around from my left (looking at the vicious), I start towards the island when he gets close.<br>
<br>
I use my Flux Staff to pull the wanderer (always a raptor).  Switch targets to the Vicious Raptor/Dinus and Flux him.  Then I turn to the right and run down the beach, passing close to the building.  That will aggro the raptor behind the building.  I target the other raptor on the beach and flux him.<br>
<br>
As soon as the fourth raptor aggros and turns towards me, I turn 90° to the right and head out over the water.<br>
<br>
Then I switch camera views to an external camera that is pointed back towards the island.  I want to watch the raptors.<br>
<br>
Then, two things: Make sure the building raptor is aggroed, and select the Vicious Raptor.<br>
<br>
If the building raptor isn't aggroed, I'll pick him up when I swing around.<br>
<br>
He should be aggroed, however.  Practice has told me how close to the building I need to move.<br>
<br>
Okay, all four raptors are chasing me at this point if things are going well.  If I timed it right, they are already starting to bunch up.  I'm running away from the island, and they are slowed down in the water.  I'll turn to my right a little and then start to make a circle around to my left.  This should finish the bunching up.<br>
<br>
Now I run back to the east end of the island, by where the Vicious Raptor/Dinus spawns.<br>
<br>
I cast Atol's as soon as possible.  This should snare all four raptors.  If I get a resist, I run north again, back out over the water.  Then turn and run to the west end of the island and repeat the snare on the raptor who resisted.  Then head towards the building and bunch all the raptors together.  I don't need to resnare, if all goes well.<br>
<br>
If all four didn't resist, I turn and back to the middle of the island, staying close to the shore.<br>
<br>
I can get three pillars in before reaching the west end of the island and turn around.  By the time I get back to the Vicious Raptor spawn, all the normal raptors should be dead and the Vicious in run mode (but not running due to the snare).  Sometimes things are a little different.  Depending on resists, I may have to scoot past them and run towards the middle of the island to finish.<br>
<br>
If you move too far away from any fleeing raptors, they will teleport back to the spawn point.  This Is Bad.<br>
<br>
If things go bad, I try to resnare and run to the chessboard island to camp.  Haven't had to do that in a while...<br>
<br>
You should also have enough time between killing the last raptor and the wanderer coming back around to get in a minute or two of spell practice (conjuration and divination for me).<br>
<br>
There are probably more efficient ways to pull the small island (the south spawns would let you pull the wanderer as soon as he spawns, instead of having to wait for him to wander), but this method is very safe and comfortable for me.<br>
<br>
I would be interested in more information on the big island.  I'm going to try out the couple methods listed above...<br>

<br>
Most people seem to like to run over the water for a bit to group them, then bring them back up onto land to snare them.  I do this with the wyverns in CS, but only because I'm not sure where all the sirens are and don't want to spend any more time over water than I have to.  But when all the wyverns are taken I've also been soloing the haunted chest (cake to do at 53), and have become somewhat experienced at underwater kiting (EB item helps for this).  What I want to know is why it seems that no-one snares or nukes in the water at all when doing raptors.  It seems to me that with lev+jboots to run along top of water, and ducking your head under to cast (I've gotten the hang of underwater kiting I said, I rarely interrupt self anymore doing this) especially snaring them would become much easier.  Not having explored yet, it sounds like kiting on the island is preferable, but kinda tight if you're not used to it - so why not kite in the water just 20 feet offshore where there's lots of room, and yet is nearby also.  Are there sharks or other water-mobs that I'm not aware of?<br>
<br>
Also, while I'm posting anyways, I may as well get your advice on whether or not I really should be starting these yet.  As I mentioned, I'm 53, and have about +450 in mana gear (and well over 200 int).  I started quadding wyverns at 51 and never really had problems with mana, though I know 53 wizards that still go oom before they can finish a quad of them, so I tend to think of myself as a somewhat more efficient quadder than most.<br>
<br>
Anyways, opinions and criticisms welcome.<br>

I have quadded pretty much exclusively from 37 to 58 now, and have done 52 to 58 on the raptors.  I have never tried the ducking under water to cast, and then re-leving over the water, but if you can do that all power to you.  I think using that method would make doing raptors a peice of cake (wish I knew how lol).  I started raptors at 52 with +385 mana and they were doable, although I did have to harvest and med kite some of the times, and sometimes had to camp out when I got a dinus.  Dinus spawns instead of the viscious raptor about 1 out of 10 times.  So at 53 with +435 you should have little trouble.

<br>
It is possible to kite them completely over the water, and duck yer head under to snare/AE.  If you have lev up to get back above water for the running part, it makes raptors very safe as it's incredibly easy to get away.  And once you get used to it, kiting in the water isn't all that bad.  Make a stop in Oasis on the way there and kite a croc in the ocean for a safe way to learn to kite in the water if you want.<br>
<br>
However, after doing this my first couple kites, I found the delays involved in stopping movement underwater to cast to be somewhat annoying, and so I would snare underwater, and then go back to land for the actual nuking part (once snared, the beach is plenty large).  A few more kites like this, and I moved back to what seems to be the standard - group them over water, then snare and nuke on land.  Using the water is a great learning tool, but you can kite faster on land.<br>
<br>
Also, I don't understand why everyone says that you will take hits quadding these.  I pull using only aggro from being near them, running along over the water out past the beach, running circles over the water, and then running a straight line over the beach (starting from a ways out over water) to get distance and snare.  I usually get to distance about mid-way across the south beech of the small island (where I like to kite the best, though I've found kiting along the south edge of large is easy too).  I've been there for 1/2 of 54 now, and haven't taken a single hit yet (though one did try and hit me, but missed) - if I hadn't asked a friend that was also soloing them with me, I wouldn't even know how much damage they hit for.  So, I am the only person I know of that quad's them completly buffless (except jboots and lev), no skin, no shielding, don't even invis to med up (medding on large usually, or on small under the iksar guy).  Then again, maybe I'm just insane.<br>

I only started recently and I have no problems kiting either. It seems to be for when you make a small mistake and get all 4 on you, you are in serious trouble without buffs.<br>
<br>
In other words it is a safety net just in case. With the sheer repetition of it I can see it would be quite easy to get lax and make a mistake.<br>

<br>
&quot;I haven't taken a single hit yet (though one did try and hit me, but missed)&quot;<br>
<br>
Hits are rare, and usually happen when you get a bit careless, or brazen.  These do often stun, and once they do, you will have 4 of them beating on you for a round or two.  They will take you down FAST, and any skin you have up could be enough to keep you out of the movement reduction health zone, which could keep you alive.<br>
<br>
So no, you don't NEED skin up to kite here, just like you don't need levitate.  But each of these spells just makes it safer.<br>
