<br>
They are trying to make wizards better.  Graffe already said, 'Are we getting better dmg nukes outside of the Bane line?' 'NO'.<br>
<br>
Verant is trying to give us more power that only works in Groups.  No wizard is gonna try to solo Tormax with Giantbane now is he?<br>
<br>
I want less recast time.  That would make us better soloers, so we won't get it.  <br>
<br>
Grim wants more dmg, that would make us better soloers so forget it.<br>
<br>
Grim wanted Percent Dmg,  What the wizard can do 10k (10% on Yelinak) in 5 seconds?  We MUST have the wizard, screw the druid and her gimp pet.  That will not happen either.<br>
<br>
I don't want but asked for Sense Buffs - See what spells mobs have on them.  This one doesn't really help soloing (Since casting Annul Magic is death for the wizard in aggro) but helps groups that need to know when a mob has Aegolism or Haste on him, we actually might get this spell.<br>
<br>
Others are focused on the Rogue dmg.  Also a bad place.  Melees can dmg forever.  If casters could dmg forever, we would be better soloers!  (Well I can with my Velium Greatstaff but that's melee not casting) So Verant Veto's that idea.<br>
<br>
Just realize that Verant has to ask each of these questions each time they get together on Monday to develop ideas to help the wizards.  Give them GOOD ideas that won't overbalance us or take away from another class.  % Dmg will make us too wanted.  More TL's don't unbalance us either way (Hence we got them).<br>
<br>
Verant's staff has their Grimstaffs as well as their Rombus's or Colossusa's.  If we are debating this so much I bet they are 10 times worse (Since they see each other)<br>

<br>
<br>
Monks are a melee class and they can solo just fine! Now my Monk is only level 20, but higher level Monks say a Monk can solo till their high 50s and maybe even level 60.<br>
<br>
At level 16 my Monk could solo yellows in Highpass Hold. Heck that named Gnoll was red and was barely hurting my Monk (which is uncommon but had to say<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
My Monk isn't even twinked, earned all his gear. Best weapons are two Fighting Batons.<br>
<br>
<br>
When my Monk can't find a group, he does what my Wizard does ...solos.<br>
<br>
Being a melee at that level I can say this. Of the casters (Chanters excluded - cuz he loves his Quickness) I'd say he loves to see Wizards more. They make the fights so much quicker ...if the group is near max people. If the group is low on people, than Necro b/c another tank is there and caster downtime really hurts. With that said, even the bad Wizards can make fights a lot shorter (when they cast that is).<br>
<br>
Though, as much as I like seeing a Wizard join the group I have to admit a melee centric group puts the MoBs down so much quicker. My Enchanter friend (now he's a twink<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) actually gets frustrated in all melee groups b/c he will slow a target and it is dead shortly after.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, I just wanted to add that Monks can solo, kinda talked more than I should. They can fear kite too! <p><p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="4" color="#0066CC">Saradin</font></i></b><br><hr><br>

<br>
Grimstaff is a passionate and dedicated defender of the wizard class.  I'm glad he cares so much and tries so hard to get us improved.  But there is no substitute for experience.  I'm sure he is an excellent wizard, but he has always been 10 levels behind the curve and so has always fought for lower level wizards.<br>
<br>
Samadhi and the other level 60 wizards know a heck of a lot more about the high level game.  You shouldn't be so quick to discount their insights.<br>
<br>
Should Verant make efforts to balance all the classes at every single level? Of course.  Is it going to happen?  No way.<br>
<br>
So while Grimstaff or other discontented wizards can always find numbers that show that a level 44 wizard is weaker than a 44 mage, or a level 8 cleric nukes more than a level 8 wizard, such facts do little to explain how the game is actually played.<br>
<br>
Some of the level 60 folks have indeed posted numbers comparing rogue damage to wizard damage.  The choice to ignore those numbers was yours.<br>
<br>
&quot;Others are trying to get some positive changes toward the class. &quot;<br>
<br>
The rest of us are trying to explain how things really are and share our experiences (good or bad).  Since hundreds of wizards will read this thread and probably zero Verant employees, you tell me which is more productive <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

More than most of the level 60 Wizards in play at present, actually, since many of them shot up levels very rapidly through quad kiting and such.  I have spent a good 50% of my time exploring, experimenting, helping people, and learning.  So I would have to say the 'lack of experience' line is a bit off base.<br>
<br>
And as for being 10 levels out of touch... from whom?  From people who are level 60?  That's an odd statement, it makes it sound like there is a baseline of Wizards that I have been consistently lower level than and there is no such thing.  I have a good memory for what I went through as a lower level Wizard, unlike, apparently, many high level wizards.  I understand what it was like, and while it is hard to believe, numbers aren't relative.  If a blast at level 1 does less damage than another blast, then it does.  Game play or not, it really DOES do that less damage.<br>
<br>
But the reason I bring this kind of thing up isn't so much to get the damage raised (although that would be good) its to point out a design and conceptual flaw with Verant and how they put the Wizard class together.  It is my firm contention that when the spell design guys lowered Wizard power after beta, they lowered it without being properly in context with the other caster classes.  In other words, when they lowered Shock of Frost to 6 points of damage, they didnt pay attention to the fact that Strike does 8 damage.  When they lowered Ice Shock to 320 damage, they didn't pay attention to the fact that Cinder Bolt does 333 damage.<br>
<br>
They didn't consider the effect of a class wholely reliant on blasts getting only one highly resisted and HUGELY aggroing blast at level 20, then a gain of only 9 points of damage 4 levels later (actually starts out lower damage).<br>
<br>
They didn't consider how much the failure of sight spells to compensate for the lacking of the Wizard class was going to impact actual play.<br>
<br>
They didn't fully and properly think through how poorly shadowstep etc and root would compensate for having no pet, nor AC/HP/combat skills of melee characters (especially after heavily nerfing fades and nerfing root).<br>
<br>
In other words, Verant wasn't being careful nor very thoughtful when they 'finished' the Wizard class, and if they WERE thoughtful, then they would see and understand what needs to be done better.  And as for the concept that we'd solo better with better damage at these levels... if it is acceptible for a Cleric - with better AC, combat skills, weapons, the ability to heal and buff - to do 41 damage to ANY target at level 5 (vs undead), why is it unacceptible for Wizards to do this damage, given their limitations and intended class design.<br>
<br>
So if you think about it a little while, you'll see it isn't about damage, it isn't about making Wizards kewl d00ds like Raistlin and Picolo or whatever his name is.  It is about getting Verant to be consistent, thoughtful, and to consider the design concept of the class more completely.<br>
<br>
Of course, I consider it to be too late now, that Verant will do no such thing, because it would take too much work.  That is despite the fact that it's pretty unanimous among other classes that Wizards are most in need of a look. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubethude.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bethude</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/23/01 12:29:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Settle down</span><hr size=1> *looks around for all these numbers that grim has*<br>

<br>
Sorry, I;m into the harder stuff.<br>
<br>
((I don't know about you, but myself and many others consider Grimstaff an excellent source of info and insights into the wizard class.))<br>
<br>
Everyone on this board can offer insights into the Wizard class, it just gets a little annoying when it degenerates into pointless whining and &quot;we're nothing but port bitches&quot; posts.<br>
<br>
((He never makes personal attacks, which you seem to actively participate in)) <br>
<br>
You've not read many of the threads here have you? <br>
<br>
((you never back up what you say with numbers, only anecdotes (sp?).))<br>
<br>
And I'm sorry I don't spend my time parsing logs and counting nukes, I'd rather actually enjoy the game. If you were a high level Wizard (Which by your post I assume you are not), you know that personal experience and knowledge of the class FAR outweighs any numerical data you know. After playing a class for a long time you get to know the class as only a person with intimate knowledge can, you get to feel how to act in different situations and adapt your tactics. You will learn more from playing a Wizard for a few encounters, actual game experience, than parsing 100 logs.<br>
<br>
((He shows the numbers, and all you do is say he is wrong and wizards have no problems. If you believe the class has no problems, just go play it. Others are trying to get some positive changes toward the class.))<br>
<br>
I seem to have to say this a lot, it must not be very clear. You will NOT get changes to a class done by a million posts that contain nothing but rehashed information and class envy/whines. You will only appear to others as a whiner, not a person looking for reasonable changes to the class. You WILL get results by discussing different ideas and finding flawed logic or thinking. I repeat, you will NOT get changes done by whining, period. If you remember a few months ago there was a thread I started on the old Whineplay regarding our epic quest pertaining to the drop rates and MOB placement of items. There was ZERO whining ont he thread, we merely discussed the issue in a logical manner and were civil about it. Compare our quest now to the quest back then please, you'll see what it accomplished.<br>
<br>
No class is perfect, all need changes or tweaks, we are not different. But I WILL defend my Wizard when the ideas posted here are illogical, obvious class envy, or they will dilute the idea of my Wizard. I've played my Wizard for well over 120 days now, I've fought (and killed in most cases) every MOB in the game, from Nagafen on up to Phara Dar and the Statue of Rallos Zek. I know Wizards who have never fought any of the &quot;uber&quot; MOBs, but have incredibly in-depth knowledge of the Wizard class from their love of the class and their desire to know their Wizard inside and out. Merloc plays on my server, he is one of the best Wizards I know. He does not do many of the big encounters, but he knows infinite strategies, tricks, and information about how to play a Wizard. These boards are here for discussion, not whining and ranting about how much we &quot;suck&quot;. <p><P align=center>

It also doesn't take a level 60 to be able to see problems with the game at level 60(I'm personally a level 56 wizard).  <br>
<br>
Grim doesn't need to post the numbers in every single thread, he doesn't need to defend that the numbers show that we need work, they do that by themselves.  Grim DOES post that the class needs work, but ISN'T broken.  So, relax, and stop trying to pick fights with one of the most respected players in the wizard community.<br>
<br>
And yes, wizards DO have problems, and yes, wizards need work done to improve the class.  Yes, in a group situation, with those who buff, the wizard will be outdamaged long-term by melees because of the upgraded weapons and armor given to the melee classes.  Yes, wizards do NOT get increased damage from Velious until level _60_.  <br>
<br>
I honestly feel that cheal was the source of most of the design flaws that we have seen in Kunark and Velious.  Complete Heal....for a small ammount of mana will heal any tank to full, no matter how many hit points he/she has.  Because of the unbalancing effect of this spell, melees are able to stay in combat more, pull more mobs, and in general, make it more difficult for wizards to keep up with these huge pulls.  The new armor and weapons only mean that Verant feels the need to give mobs more hit points, rather than giving mobs new abilities in combat.  Verant should have moved Complete Heal up to level 60, and added several other heal spells in between to compensate.  Not only would this help balance the game, but would keep the MOBS from being able to cheal all over the place, and make it easier to properly balance the high level game.<br>

     Someone posted that its not all about damage like it is with melees.  I don't need to be level 60 to know that it is all about Damage, that is certainly what the manual said, and its why I choose the class.  Someone said we have other things to contribute like root and snare.  Well, sure we do, and I use these spells, but it misses the point.  Druids can root, nuke, snare and Heal, which makes them more versatile.  In other words other caster classes can contribute things other than damage too, and they contribute a heck of alot more.  So, other things being equal, you pick the more versatile class for the group.

<br>
I'm confident that no one out there is powerlevelling on the Dain.  Those who fight the bigger mobs get there by doing small xp groups just like yourself.  The only difference is that many members of large guilds never spend time looking for pickup groups, so other's perceptions of wizard power don't affect us.<br>
<br>
And yes, I'm sorry to say that there is a baseline level towards which Verant seems to balance classes and content.  The whole introduction of the bane series proves that.<br>
<br>
Also, while you've spent your time having fun and levelling slowly (which is great), you are inherently experiencing a different game than many of us at level 60 - simply because the game has changed a lot.  <br>
<br>
Back when I was level 20 nobody wanted warriors because they had no more hps than a paladin - nowadays warriors are one of the best classes in the game.<br>
<br>
Back when I was level 25 I just had to outdamage melee wielding combine weapons - it was easy back then.<br>
<br>
Back when I was level 30 rogues were considered a broken class - things have changed.<br>
<br>
Back when I was level 50, my well equipped melee friends were lucky to have yakeshas and crafted armor.  Nowadays the average level 35 warrior has far better gear than that.<br>
<br>
Because of ongoing class balancing and enormous changes in the quality and availability of melee gear, you were playing a drastically different game at level 49 than I was.  I could outdamage anyone in the game with ice comet.  Perhaps rogues at that level could outdamage you.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying this is the way things should be.  But it is just the way things are.  Equipment makes a huge impact on melee classes and almost no impact on wizards below 50.<br>
<br>
So kudos to you on your excellent memory.  But you have to keep in mind that it isn't that level 60 wizards have forgotten everything or were all magically transformed to level 60 without having to fight their way there.  It's just that the game has changed drastically since then, and because you have consistently been many levels behind the front, you have a much more negative view of things.<br>
<br>
Indeed, one could argue that classes shouldn't be balanced at all levels.  I always liked the fact that wizards started out a little weaker and ended up stronger relatively.  Does that mean wizards should have to suffer though 59 levels of mediocrity?  Of course not.  But the discussion of the high level game is still important since it is the one point at which everyone agrees (Verant included) that all classes should be balanced.<br>
<br>

<br>
Not being able to find a group is highly subjective, for every Wizard that says they can't I've seen another wizard respond saying they have. You seem to fail to realize how small of a % of the game grouping with random strangers is. Most time grouped int heg ame will be spent with your guild or friends, not with 5 random strangers you saw hanging around. It's incredibly easy to get a group of 5 friends and get EXP while also having fun.<br>
<br>

<br>
Since you seem to be referring to groups in your post I'll stay with that idea. If everything is about damage then why are clerics and enchanters every invited into groups, they do about 0 damage in a group. They are invited because their class has utility spells that aid the group overall, which help in gaining of experience and enjoyment of the game. We have a whole lot of spells available to us that aid the group more than just by dealing damage. A well played Wizard in an EXP group will be recognized for more than just the damage he does (which is still substantial). His ability to snare, root, control aggro (even aggro of other group memebers), evac, stun, nuke, and AE is invaluable to a group. I will guarantee you that you can tell a well played Wizard from a Wizard who only thinks that his job is to do damage.  <p><P align=center>

Sorry, Samadhi, but that's the truth.<br>
Wizards who said it is easy for them to find a group are people with a huge guild and a huge friendslist.<br>
For every one single Wiz who claimed that it is sooo easy for him to get a group there are dozens of Wizards who have trouble to find a group.<br>
And from my personal experience every time i yone in to sebilis, i see 4 to 6 wiz lfg for at least 2 hours while no other class has this difficulty.<br>
Those WIzards who state that it is no problem for them to find a group do either:<br>

- dream the dream of a completly fine working Wizard class because they can't admit that they play a bugged class<br>
<br>
<br>
Now to the rogue issue:<br>
<br>
Why are the Masters of magical Damage, the Wizards, almost stunned if they come to encounter a low level and not at all epic encounter like Spite Golems in hate?<br>
Why Verant have to make Mobs almost completly resistant to magical attacks, so that they had to invent Lures for us WIzards?<br>
<br>
Rogues especially nd any other melee class do no have the smallest difficulty to fight those Mobs.<br>
Druids, ENchanters and Mages just sit down and are frustrated. Wizards jubilee, if their Lues hit once out of 4 times those Mobs.<br>
This is completly unnessecary.<br>
<br>
So, Samadhi, please answer me that question:<br>
<br>
Why can Rogues completly unaffected beat on those Spite Golems while Wizards struggle on them?<br>
<br>
THAT is the point and things like that make our class completly unreliable.<br>

It maybe differ from the idea of MY Wizard <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  All i can see in your posting is, that you are really about to close the eyes and are scared to admit that we have MAJOR issues. You don't like to realize it, because your dream of teh powerfull uber Wizard in an uber Guild isn't comming true. I wish you could admit that for yourself.<br>
<br>
A lot of Wizard in the Guild Afterlife on my server (a friendly guild to my guild) REITIRED their Wizards. They play them sometimes, because in their hearts they are still Wizards. But mostly they play their Rogue or Monk. Like Zurren btw, Samadhi.<br>
<br>
There are A LOT of level 60 WIzards out who are now EX-Wizards or do have the power to staz with their WIzard like me and realize that this class is COMPLETLY screwed in terms of Balance against the melee classes at the higher levels . (Make that level 56 plus).<br>
<br>
As i said, BoTS is NOT the only uber guild out there and you are not the only level 60 Wiz out there, Samadhi. A lot of fellow Sorcerer became decouraged.

<br>
Because they're uninventive? Because in Kunark they had to up MOB resists to insane amount otherwise anything could get slowed/hit by regular nukes, thereby removing and difficulty? Spite Golems make up about .000000000000001% of the total Mobs, I can hit the other 99.9999999999999% just fine if I play smart.<br>

<br>
Rogues don't have an easy job, no matter what you think =) Usually if a Wizard can only ever land 4 Lures on anything he fights it's not a game issue but a player issue (Save Spite golems).<br>
<br>
((So, Samadhi, please answer me that question:<br>
<br>

<br>
Because Rogues have nothing else to offer than damage? Spite Golems are melee MOBs, and again they make up about .000000000000001% of the total MOBs in the game, It's idiotic to make your sweeping gneralizations on game balance on these =)<br>
<br>
((THAT is the point and things like that make our class completly unreliable.))<br>

<br>
<br>
Clerics and enchanters do insane amounts of damage, it's just not direct. Without clerics, melee's wouldn't do a fraction of the damage they do, they'd die. Enchanters haste, which adds to melee damage, and mez, which saves damage, which indirectly deals mucho damage. Clerics and enchanters are really the biggest damage dealers in the game, it's just that they have to channel it through melee's. Wizards, on the other hand, do almost exclusivly damage. Evacs are falling by the wayside, snares and root are nice, but are filled by druids or rangers. Although I must say that stuns are nice, I just wish I wouldn't have to wait till 49 for a friggin' upgrade. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=221&stop=240>12</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=241&stop=260>13</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=261&stop=264>14</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=394.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=394.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=394.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=394.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=394.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=394.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
