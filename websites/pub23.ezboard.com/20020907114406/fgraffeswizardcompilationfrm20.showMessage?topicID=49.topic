Had a rough time finding a group, and the two I did find were short lived.  Xp was slow, I grew frustrated, so off I went to the Great Divide to hunt Cave Kodiaks.  Two days later (at most) I was 41.  Once I learned the spawns I developed a system; here it is:<br><br>Getting to the bear caves:  Turn right as you're leaving Thurgadin and follow the wall well past the Tizmaks.  You'll eventually see the GD portal ring in a valley to your left.  Continue following the wall and you will come to a nice long plateau.  This is your kiting arena.  You may well see a wanderer here or in the valley.  If so, note his location and direction, but do not snare him yet.<br><br>Following the wall you come to a cave (C1).  Only rarely does a bear spawn in here (usually it only contains the Coldain Smuggler), so I usually use it as a place to med.  <br><br>Go past this cave, turning right as you stick to the wall.  You will come to a second cave (C2).  This one contains many bears, but there are three spawn points just inside that are worth noting (bears don't actually spawn there, they stroll in from the deeper caves).  Normally, you only worry about the bear closest to you.  More on this below.<br><br>Go past this cave just a ways and there is a final cave (C3).  Give the cave mouth a wide berth, since there is a spawn point just inside that isn't easy to see.  Not far behind this spawn is a second bear point.  Verify that neither are Icetooth, as he can ruin your day pretty quickly.<br><br>When multi-kiting I always have a SoW up (main is a shaman, so potions are free).  I advise having some sort of speed boost here as well.  Pull the bear at the mouth of the cave with BoF.  Pull it well away then circle around, run into C3 and pull the 2nd bear.  Do try not to get sandwiched between them; they're slow but can hit pretty hard.  <br>Get them together and run to C2.  Enter C2 and stick to the right wall.  The spawns are around a bend and occasionally one will be at a spawn point right around it.  Once you're around the bend you'll see a very short hallway with a sharp turn to the right.  Usually there are one or two bears here; pull the closest to you.  Note, if you see  no bears click near the corner; usually one is hanging out right there (and will aggro if you get close looking for him).  In any case, pull the closest with BoF and get outside before the previous two catch up.  Gather and reapply BoF.  Run them to the plataeu, medding a bit as you go.<br><br>Now you'll want to look for a 4th.  I rarely have trouble finding one, as wanderers are common.  Above all the caves is a ledge upon which you can find a wanderer (the entrance to Velks is above C3).  One can usually be found on the plateau itself or in the valleys around it.  If you can't find a 4th, 3 will have to do.<br><br>Then it's just a matter of rounding them up, CoF 6 or 7 times, then I usually use Flame Shock to kill the resisters.  When it's all said and done, I'd get most of a blue in 40, and at least a full blue in 41.  Xp is still good in 42.  <br><br>Considerations:<br><br>I did this from 40-42 with a 193 Int and SoW potions.  Wanderers aren't usually a problem; indeed, after pulling from the caves you're usually looking for one anyway (however, if you're not friendly to Tizmaks be careful as they're often found in the area).  <br><br>Ferals are the weakest bears, the most numerous, and the ones I usually kited.  IIRC, they have 1300hps.  Savages are a bit stronger, with 1500hps, but I never had a problem when one was included in the mix.  Ferocious are the strongest, no hp count (but 1700 seems about right).  I avoided them when multi-kiting.<br><br>Sometimes your 4th will be moving up or down the wall to/from the ledge above.  Unless you're dangerously close or on equal level you'll typically get &quot;Target is out of range&quot; when using BoF.  It's not unusual for people to camp the bears.  Given spawn rates and numbers, you might be able to convince the campers to let you take a spawn.  perhaps you can beguile them with the chance to see real quad kiting at work! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>I notice in C2 sometimes, when I target the bear in the hall I somehow target the bear around the corner instead.  When targetting the bear at the rear hall spawn point, target it's left side (as you're facing it).  Usually it's a savage around the corner, so if that's what  you come up with, try targetting again or move close enough to see its name.<br><br>The loot is real poor and quite random.  Usually they drop either a pelt or claws, which sell to vendors for 4 or 5 plat.  Rarely they drop a bracer AC 6 Str 3 which I give to guild newbies.  It's all about the xp here, and I found the xp to be pretty good.  By the time you've medded the spawns are back up, rinse and repeat.<br><br>I hope this guide proves useful.  I had a lot of success getting out of 40 (and 41 and 42) here.  May you as well.<br><br>Caracatan Stormforge<br>Devotee of Solusek Ro <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showPrevMessage?topicID=49.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showNextMessage?topicID=49.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=49.topic><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.emailToFriend?topicID=49.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.threadControl?topicID=49.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=49.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=49.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Luclin Spell Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Luclin Faction Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Luclin Quest Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Luclin Item Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm31">Fusibility Research<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm30">Veeshan's Peak Key</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20>AE Kiting</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.4.8<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
