<br>
Here's the facts as I know it:<br>
<br>
A Rogue will OWN a wizard 51+, In a Group.<br>
<br>
That's why they need to fix it.<br>
<br>
A SUPER TWINKED Rogue will own a Wizard Pre 50.  Well that is true for almost any class.<br>
<br>
<br>
This is to Grimstaff:<br>
Quote:<br>
&quot;Unbalanced does not equal 'stinks' Collossusa. Unbalanced means unbalanced. The first level 50 player in live Everquest was a Rogue, the most unbalanced, messed up class in the game. You can succeed, enjoy yourself, and even work in groups while being unbalanced and in need of work. &quot;<br>
<br>
Unbalanced Does mean Stinks.  Why do you want the wizard class to be 'fixed'?  So that it is an even progression?  That doesn't change anything.  I liked after going 9 levels without too many new things to all of a sudden have Group Gates (Or Even Ice Comet).  You keep talking about how the wizards are 'unbalanced'.  To what end?  To make it so dmg is progressively better each level?  HAH! You want it so that Wizards are more uber.  Hence we must currently stink.<br>
If you are enjoying the class and can work in groups well (Like I did 1-50) then you would NEVER consider yourself unbalanced.<br>
<br>
The first level 50 player was a Rogue?  I think it was a Druid or Shaman.  I the first 50 I met on Mith Marr was a druid (I remember because a Wolf was taking out Griffins in EC in May99).   Grim since you are from Jun 99, don't you remember?  Until Sneak Hide was given to Rogues, they SUCKED!  They were considered the worse class to play.  How can the first level 50 be a rogue with it was the lowest played class accross the servers.  So if it was a Rogue, they made 50 with the worse class in the game.  <br>
<br>
Now you are on the You a level 60 and have forgotten how it was when you were level 20.   I haven't.  It was HARD!  But it was doable.  Wizards sucked in Lower Guk because they didn't have ITU and all other caster classes did.  (Though Druids sucked worse)<br>
<br>
We remember Grim, but you won't know unbalanced until you get to like 55.<br>

<br>
Are you saying I'm lying to support my argument Grimstaff?  Can't you take the word of a level 60 wizard with nearly 180 days /played?  My rogues log their damage, my wizards log theirs.  On an epic raid you can't turn on &quot;others hits&quot; - for one, all of the &quot;others hits&quot; don't come through (log an unslowed Cazic thule for example sometime, and test).  Secondly, it lags the hell out of most people.  I'm lagged enough on a dialup - I don't care to add any more lag just to prove a point to you - and I'm sure you'd say I'm doctoring the logs anyway.  <br>
<br>
The level 60 rogues say they do 4000-4800 damage per minute, on average.  I believe them.  The DB wizards say they do an average of 5k per minute (some 6k).  I believe them. <br>
<br>
Disclaimer: (Since I know someone will bring it up)  The 4800 mark is an average we came up with against many &quot;epic&quot; encounter mobs - most with high AC.  Sure, I can find numbers that say a rogue will do 6k damage per minute - against Krups in sebilis.  Stick with the context at hand, epic encounters.<br>
<br>
This whole thing has been settled.  At the very *WORST* the rogues and wizards toe to toe are equal on banes mobs..  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma" size="2"><a href="http://www.noows.com/eqprofiles.php?show=582">Frozboz D'Sospes</a> | <a href="http://www.noows.com">Fires of Heaven</a></font>

Ok So Grim,<br>
<br>
Explain how a 1-50 wizard is unbalanced now?<br>
<br>
&quot;You now have Snare&quot;<br>
<br>
Its an AoE Snare that costs A LOT of mana.  It will hit you if the mob is close. It hits my group mates on Tallon Zek, so I don't use unless soloing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Snare now stacks with root&quot;<br>
<br>
Since I only use when soloing, and am usually kiting, I don't snare/root as much as I thought I would.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rains now don't hit pets&quot;<br>
<br>
They are resisted WAY too much, they hit my group mates on Tallon, so no one uses them.<br>
<br>
&quot;Sense magic is replaced with True North&quot;<br>
<br>
ROFLMAO - now we ARE balanced hahaa<br>
<br>
&quot;You now have Translocate&quot;<br>
Correction, level 39 wizards have translocate.  It doesn't DO one damn thing about balancing me or get me in groups, so don't place it here.<br>
<br>
&quot;You have newer gates&quot;<br>
<br>
Great, when I'm porting to the Dreadlands I'll use a little less mana! I'm balanced!<br>
<br>
&quot;You have ITU.&quot;<br>
<br>
Level 39 spell that drops FAR too infrequently and costs 1k on my server. Don't have it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wow I don't see where we stink pre 50 &quot;<br>
<br>
Then you're completely blind. We may not &quot;stink&quot; but we're far from okay or group friendly. <br>
<br>
A mage can outdamage me in a group without his pet, which are the best pets in the game.  A druid can nuke almost as well as me plus heal, damage shield, sow, dot, buff AND track.<br>
<br>
We're far from okay pre-50. <br>

I'm not confused, son.  I have the numbers.  I've done more logs than I can count.  I've asked my friends to log their damage and get back to me with the results.  Should I not trust them with that 4800 mark and ask for the actual logs just to prove a point to you?  <br>
<br>
Don't listen to all these people saying Rogues outdamage Wizards in all situations, since it just IS NOT TRUE.  On a dragonsbane mob, the wizards WILL outdamage the rogue.  Slightly yes, but they do outdamage on average 4.8k/min vs 5k/min.  Log the damage yourself next time you're fighting Yelinak, Tormax, Feshlak, Vindicator. <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma" size="2"><a href="http://www.noows.com/eqprofiles.php?show=582">Frozboz D'Sospes</a> | <a href="http://www.noows.com">Fires of Heaven</a></font>

I would not trust FoH for s***.  Someone who would be in a guild that does this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.celestialtomb.com/">www.celestialtomb.com/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
is not someone I trust to tell the truth about anything.  FoH might just want to lie about wizards to cofuse other guild they are cometing with.  All I have to say is thank god Brell is a nice server where guilds work together.  If this post is true about FoH, I would feel ashamed to be in their guild regardless of all the other server politics that might have gien them motive.<br>
<br>
As for wizards outdamaging rogues.  My guild has yet to be in a battle where wizards would outdamage duel wielders.  Since we are the most addicted players (not in any sense better than anyone) on our server, this means that 99.9999% of all wizards everywhere are outdamaged by rogues.<br>
<br>
As for the debate on getting groups, the only way I grouped to 60 was to make groups myself.  If any of you has ever played a cleric or warrior (alt 55 warrior myself), you get 5 tells in 1 min from logging on about groups as a cleric and perhaps 1 or 2 in 5 mins as a warrior.  Usually zero as a wizard.  Anyone can make groups and get exp but that takes alot of effort.  Not everyone gets invited to groups.<br>

Thus, the most you will probably get is summary info like rog did 20k, wiz did 24k, etc.  That's just the way it is.  My guild would not be too happy with me if I posted logs here either.  Do you think there's some kind of conspiracy to fool all the other wizards with our &quot;mystery&quot; logs?  <br>
<br>
Here's something you probably don't realise about all these incredible rogue logs:  1) they are often against regular mobs, not ubermobs.  Toss a rogue up against a level 70 mob and they don't look quite so hot.  2) most of the logs are brag sheets.  They post them to say how uber soandso is.  That's nifty but it doesn't give you an average of what a rogue can do against mob X.  A single log is near useless for providing reliable measurement of what you can expect a rogue to do ON AVERAGE against a particular mob.<br>
<br>
Here's a summary of the facts, not a bunch of jaded bullshit:<br>
<br>
vs. single mob = wizards are the weakest.  Less so at the lower levels, more so at the higher levels where mob hp become insane.  Lower level wizards typically contribute more damage percentage-wise than higher level wizards, so higher wizards typically try to compensate via utility spells.  Rogues obviously crank out far more dmg than we do in this scenario.<br>
<br>
vs. multiple mobs = wizards are gods here.  This is where we shine and make the best equipped melee (rogues included) look like complete ass.  There's no ifs, ands, or buts, this is the best part of being a wizard.  The additional beauty of this type of group is that rogues are utterly and completely useless.  Any other melee is more desirable for pulling in a aoe group. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
vs. 32k ubermobs = wizards do quite well here.  Don't forget that kunark mobs and lure spells caused many guilds to recruit wizards.  The reason is we kick ass against these mobs.  Our damage usually meets or exceeds a rogues damage in this environment.<br>
<br>
vs. 100kp+ ubermobs = depends.  With mobs that we can only use lures on, we tend to have damage on par with a well equipped SK.  Against mobs that are baneable, we tend to exceed rogue damage.  <br>
<br>
--------------------------------<br>
<br>
So, we suck damagewise on one out of four categories.  I don't see what the problem is folks.  The bottom line is that we will NEVER compete with melee when it comes to single target damage in a regular group.  GET OVER IT.  IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN -- EVER!  If that's the only kind of grouping you care about, then I suggest you switch classes ASAP. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ualderonbrell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AlderonBrell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/24/01 10:31:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misunderstandings</span><hr size=1> <br>

You play for fun, Grim? What do uber-guilds play for then? Holy shiot, they play for fun too. What do I consider fun? Being the best, beating challenges and doing/getting things first. A wizard allows me to do that.<br>
<br>
Tonight, just for fun, I think I'll go have coffee with Zlandicar and talk to him about how funny all the little rat worshippers in his cave are. That's why Verant put him there, right? Maybe I'll go ask the Sleeper how his nap was. Converse with Yelinak about what a wonderful kingdom he has. Talk strategy with Tormax, to plan for the next dwarf raid. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www,kestrelarts.com/images/book.jpg BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/24/01 10:54:40 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/grimtoo.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misunderstandings</span><hr size=1> &quot;Do you think there's some kind of conspiracy to fool all the other wizards with our &quot;mystery&quot; logs?&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I think there's a conspiracy to prevent anyone from learning anything you have learned so you can reap the maximum benefits at other people's expense.  I think that you are witholding information because you are so uber you don't care about anyone but your guild, which takes the form of stomping on anyone who gets in your way.  Does your guild do this specifically?  I can't say, but believe me many uber guilds DO.<br>
<br>
Not posting the logs leaves us up to just believing your word, which isn't exactly compelling.  Posting logs leaves you up to deciding if they made it all up (unlikely but possible) and able to see the data and understand.  You make the call, if I claimed Wizards were outdamaged on Yelinak by Enchanters every fight... and you hadn't ever fought Yelinak, would you believe it just cause I said so?<br>
<br>
The rogue logs I have seen were on Veeshans Peak and other monsters, not on Orc pawns Bethude.  They were from other Uber guilds who weren't terrified someone might learn something.  There are other reports on monsters that show, without logs, that Monks, Rogues, and even Warriors and Paladins outdamage Wizards on long super fights.  Like I said, I have no problem with this.  My problem is acting like its not true and not being willing to show evidence.<br>
<br>
Then getting all huffy because people don't dive to your feet and believe you because you say so.<br>
<br>
I play for fun as opposed to getting to level 60, which is what was stated EXPLICITLY to be the reason he played.  Its sad people seem to be more interested in finding something to argue about and jump on rather than reading what is said and trying to think about it.<br>
<br>
I am not saying people are lying when they don't produce proof, I am saying why should I beleive you without any evidence when the evidence I have seen says the opposite.  How hard is that to follow? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubethude.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bethude</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/24/01 11:12:10 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misunderstandings</span><hr size=1> &quot;vs. multiple mobs = this is such a rare case it is not important and ae groups are stil very risky&quot;<br>
<br>
BS!  It's not Verant's fault that people don't do AoE.  They gave us the tools so if we don't use them it's our own damn fault.  Most people are too damn chicken to use aoe.  Oh, and about the risky part...lol, I can die three times a night doing aoe and still get better xp than I would if I was in a regular group.  No, I'm not exaggerating.<br>
<br>
&quot;vs. 32k ubermobs = actually its only gore and hoshkar where wizards are ok but here we are only equal to magi and druids for nukes.  Something like trakanon, tanks outdamage wizards easily.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, lets clarify this.  You are pointing out mobs that aoe slow and therefore we do good damage against them.  It doesn't work that way.  If most of your tanks are slowed against hoshkar (except for very brief periods of time) then you will die plain and simple.  The major determining factor in those fights is whether tanks are using offensive disciplines.  If they are, they can certainly exceed a wizard's damage.  If not, the wizard should exceed the tank's.  A wizard doing 10% or more of the mobs hp in damage is in no way unusual against a 32khp dragon (yeah even the ones that require lures to hit).  Not bad for a single wizard considering you probably have 30 people there.  Sorry, but that's hardly lacking.<br>
<br>
&quot;vs. 100kp+ ubermobs = some bane mobs we might be equal but overall we are worse damage dealers&quot;<br>
<br>
Many ubermobs are baneable, thx.  For the most part, only the gimpy ones are not (like kland, zland, etc.).  I don't have a good argument for the statue or aow.  I think they should be baneable via Hsagra's Wrath. *shrugs*<br>
<br>
&quot;so 3/4 we are 2nd rate, 1/4 we are decent but who cares about ae groups&quot;<br>
<br>
I care about aoe groups because aoe is 10 times more fun than a regular group.  In fact, even if aoe groups were less xp than a good regular group I would take them over a regular group because it's that much more fun.  Most of the happy wizards are the wizards who get to AoE from time to time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulaeroth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laeroth</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/24/01 11:35:49 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Misunderstandings</span><hr size=1> According to you uber-guilds play to get levels and keep information from everyone else so they can step on peoples toes better.

That's great, so does everyone. Fun for me is being the best, beating every challenge and doing/getting things first. That's fun for me, that's the fun I play for. What fun do you play for?<br>

<br>
First of all, if gaining level 60 was the EXPLICIT reason he played for, don't you think he would quit, seeing as he already made 60? Secondly, do you think he had zero fun doing it? I seriously doubt it. I surely wouldn't play a game that wasn't fun.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you have logs from a dungeon with a handfull of 32,000hp mobs, but those aren't the main concern anymore.<br>

<br>
So what you're saying is you have logs from deep inside Temple of Veeshan that contradict what Frozboz is saying? Or you have logs of 32,000hp mobs that don't quite compare to ToV mobs, but they contradict anyhow? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a> <b>7</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=221&stop=240>12</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=241&stop=260>13</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showMessageRange?topicID=394.topic&start=261&stop=264>14</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showPrevMessage?topicID=394.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.showNextMessage?topicID=394.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.emailToFriend?topicID=394.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.threadControl?topicID=394.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=394.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=394.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
