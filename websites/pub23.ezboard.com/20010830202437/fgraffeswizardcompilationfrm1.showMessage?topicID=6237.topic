<br>
A very polite gentleman (I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> very</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> rarely use such formal terms), came up and asked what I thought of my Wizard.<br>
<br>
<br>
I told him the truth, that I loved my wizard dispite a lot of the problems.<br>
<br>
<br>
He seemed to understand fully (I think he was someones twink, he seemed to know a lot about the higher end game).<br>
<br>
Thing to the effect of &quot;Wizard rock once they get into their 30s, shame it's such a bitch to get there because groups don't appreciate you&quot;.<br>
<br>
And he didn't say it in a condesending way, but in a way that showed he understood.<br>
<br>
<br>
A few days before that I started chatting with a druid (level 53 no less), asking about Wizards.<br>
<br>
This was moments after I wiped out a Derv Train at the druid ring with Thunderclap and a couple quick follow up blasts.<br>
<br>
He'd grown tired of the high-level second line nature of druids, and wanted to be one of the blasters.  Talking about how on his last raid they'd get the mob to half, the RL would call NUKE, and then mob would be dead, becuase they were able to get a good number of Wizards for the raid.<br>
<br>
If you have enough Wizards, basically any encounter in the game is Trivial.  No other class can say that.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think people are starting to realize, at least on some servers, that Wizards are a force to be delt with, esspecailly outside of Velious (which is so caster unfriendly it makes me sick, I'd hate to see what it was like pre-resist fix (I was level 16 when SoV was released)).<br>
<br>
<br>
I think things are looking up for the Wizard class in the biggest problem area, with is player appreciation. <p><TABLE ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=460 COLS=1 BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=#FF0000>

Velious and exp groups. Before velious wizards were the  supreem raid class. 6 to 8 wizards of suficient level could trivialize ANY encounter. Then as now we weren't so good in exp groups but it didn't matter because our raid usefullness was high enough to make up for it.<br>
<br>
Velious ruined everything. Really should've been realsed with the name Caster_Bane, that fits better. Between rediculous resists and mobs with 10 times the hps wizards have it bad. The exception being Sorceres with bane spells against the 5 o 6 mobs who can be effected by them.<br>
<br>
As far as druid vs wizard in a duel i'm afraid that at 60 the druid does have a significant advantage. Yes your high resists make it hard for him to land dds but druids have several high damage dots that are virtually unresistable as well as that killer fire resist debuff. <br>
<br>
Don't forget that the druids resists will be even higher then yours so lures will be all that will land on them. Sure lightening strike is faster then his heals but you're not gonna kill him with that. The moment you go to cast a 4.5 second lure he can heal himself for 987 hps. SO while you're sitting there nuking with an efficiency of 1.7 damage/mana (after pvp decrease) and time efficiency of 83 damage/sec he is healing with an efficiency of  2.5 health/mana and a time efficiency of 125 health/sec (after recast delay). Not only can the druid easily outheal your damage (assuming your lures land for full, his heals always will) but he can outlast you since he's more efficient.<br>
<br>
In addition to all that regrowth+fungi gives him 30(?) hps per tick and PoG gives him an extra 6 mana/tick even while standing. Wizards have no regen items or spells and the best mana we can do (without alkabor staff) is 3 mana/tick from BoF and that will only last till his dot tears through your shield.<br>
<br>
So to sum up druids own wizards in duels at lvl 60 long as they are properly prepared and know what they are doing. Just have to land a dot then outheal your damage and they win. Lights out for the Wizard. And yes i tested this in game its not all just number theory. I ran the numbers first and then tested it against a lvl 60 druid friend of mine. Once he knew the proper strategy he won easily. = (<br>

<br>
Assumptions:  <br>
1. both have as many crystallized pumice stones or golem metal wands, and spell components, as desired;<br>
2. wiz has harvest up/ready;<br>
3. both have as many self-cast buffs up as desired and are at full mana;<br>
4. both have jboots;<br>
5. both have top end resists and magic gear;<br>
6. neither has(or will use epic...only cos i havent factored that in, and just for fairness as I expect there are a few 60s that dont have epics yet - someone else can modify comparison to factor in epics);<br>
7. Neither has any unique or ultra top-end offensive proc/right click effect (eg stick of alakbor, or stuff not generally known about yet);<br>
<br>
8. This is a stand-up duel, where neither can run and stay outside the other's max nuke range, but can get outside ae range...because that would need factoring in separate tactics that I havent looked at yet);<br>
<br>
9. Neither will engage in melee (again, the tactics change, with root/snaring needing to be factored in, and wpns armour playing a possibly bigger role...this can be looked at by others also).<br>
<br>
10. each has total mana from stats/gear of 3050(a detailed look at the formulae for mana, etc might show this as overly fair to the druid?  Correct me if I'm wrong please).<br>
<br>
Flowing thought type items/spells and duration of fight will modify total effective mana slightly, but I'm thinking it likely won't be much so will ignore it for this example.<br>
<br>
Ok, given the above, a cursory inspection of numbers showed me the following (hypothetical duel):<br>
<br>
Both open with pillage enchantment effects on the other to remove all buffs, both activate jboots, both begin casting.<br>
<br>
Druid casts winged death (350mana ct5 - dot 94dam per 6 seconds pvp).<br>
Wiz casts steelskin (mana130 damabsorbed230 ct4.5)so wiz can cast after druid starts casting and still get it in first, and if not dispelled by druid, will allow the wiz at least 2 pulses to pumice self before taking any real damage...assuming Winged Death is not resisted.<br>
<br>
winged death at 350 mana per shot, would allow 8 casts with 200 mana left over.<br>
<br>
If the battle runs WD/steelskin/pumice/WD/steelskin/pumice, etc, once the druid gets down to his 200mana, the wiz can open up with lures. (8 steelskins costs the wiz 1040mana, leaving 1960mana to the druids 200).<br>
<br>
Now, lure of frost (just for example, in practice a dueling wiz would probably vary the lures so as not to hit druids best res only) costs 320mana for 422dam pvp per cast, which allows 6 casts before needing to harvest.<br>
<br>
This, if no resists, will thump the druid for 2532damage pvp. The druid's healing has no bearing in the fight until the wiz starts going on the offensive.<br>
<br>
In this example, I gave each starting mana of 3050, so the druid now has exactly enough mana for one superior heal.<br>
Sup heal costs 250mana, has ct4.5 and heals 583 damage, leaving 1949 damage pvp done to the druid.<br>
<br>
In a real duel with limited area to move in, I expect the wiz would find it quite difficult to get a harvest off and hope to win. <br>
<br>
I'm not sure how many hp a 60 druid is likely to have, but<br>
if one lure of frost is resisted, that still leaves 2112 damage pvp, if the druid doesn't have the full 3050 starting mana.<br>
<br>
Of course the druid could try throwing some nukes, but I doubt many would connect, given the presumed resists.<br>
<br>
If the druid really has a big bundle of hp, maybe meleeing the wiz might tip the balance, as the wiz may not channel through enough hits, but how much damage can the druid do vs a clever wiz? <br>
<br>
Obviously the wiz is not certain to win in all situations in the real thing, eg large areas where one can run and hide to med up/heal etc, differing spell ranges, outsiders buffing/healing/assisting, spell interruptions, special ultrarare(even for 60s) items, tactical skill of combatants, all could swing things in favour of the druid or into overkill for the wiz.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any more thoughts on how wiz/druid line up in one-on-one?<br>
<br>
p.s. sorry about the saga...hope it isn't entirely unentertaining. <br>
<br>
It's just that, to me, on the face of it, I think wizards stand up pretty well against druids in pvp single combat...maybe some pvpers could give some real-server experiences in this regard?<br>

Try to nuke a level 60 War with his resists. Add a crappy environment for us Wizzys, so we can't use Yonder (e.g. a box).<br>

Add to that the fact that most Warriors to have nowadays see invis items.<br>
