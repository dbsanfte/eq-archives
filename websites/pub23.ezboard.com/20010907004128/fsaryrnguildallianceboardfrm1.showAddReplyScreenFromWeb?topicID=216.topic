Phinny sure destroyed us for some reason.  I think it was a bug because all of a sudden that butt ugly “king” of fish disappeared.  That was when I became worried.  3 minutes later I was summoned to his lair, but there was nothing in there to greet me for some reason.  Next thing I hear are screams and next thing I know there are 2 people in the zone…Well Tekkang, even though I did seem to bug you I had an awesome time on this raid and I thank you for leading it.  In fact I had such a fun time I was wondering if anyone would be interested in coming on an xp group trip up here sometime.  Just like 6 people.   It’s good xp I think and even if it isn’t it will still be fun.<br>
<br>
I have some Pics I’ll post later since I have to go now.  Several of when everyone was on Phinny and 1 or 2 of when Phinny had just cleared the entire room of us and you’ll get to see the corpses in that room with the ugly fish standing over them…<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
But yeah... overall I had alot of fun. Kedge is a unique place. I was particularly impressed when we prevented total party wipeout with the 6 horses that were CH'ing eachother, and with our enchanters on Phinny's pull for keeping us up as long as they did. Rabb did a great job with learning how to pull his lair.<br>
<br>
I'm pumped about going back... heh.. and I read that the piece you need Tek is like 1 in 10 drop so we better get good at this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We learned alot, this last attempt. I have several ideas and observations that might be helpful.<br>
<br>
First I think Tekkang did a great job handling this raid. Directions were very clear, and we all seemed to understand them right away. I think the teamwork was extremely good for a first raid to a new zone.<br>
<br>
Two chanters can keep the 8 guardians mezzed but we should have a third chanter.<br>
<br>
Phinny needs to be stopped from casting spells. Stuns (if possible), theft of thought, mana sieve, whril till you hurl, Larg Lamintation, etc should be directed at Phinny as much as possible. The two or three complete heals turned the battle in Phinny's favor.<br>
<br>
Phinny must have at least 8 buffs up so it needs to have two recant magics cast on it.<br>
<br>
The mages did a great job with water stones and mod rods, three mages isnt too many.<br>
<br>
Some of the outer seahorses are very hard to mezz or get any spell to stick to them.<br>
<br>
The guardians mezzed easily.<br>
<br>
I was thinking that perhaps a monk could swim to the back of phinny's room and pull several of the guardians there and FD. Then when they are still by the monk another puller could pull the rest out into the room we were in.<br>
<br>
Or perhaps we can do the normal FD tag pulling get a few guardians first before we try to tackle Phinny.<br>
<br>
Another thought would to be to rush the room after we have pulled Phinny that way gate wouldnt mess us up.<br>
<br>
I think three full groups of 50 plus would be best for this type of attack; 3 chanters, 3 mages, 3 pally (for stunning), and then a mix of others. But that might be dreaming. <br>
<br>
This should be considered similar to trying to kill VOX, tough but with the right organization and tactics quite possible to do.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the well run raid, and I too would like to exp hunt here sometime soon.<br>

I think we all learned alot about how to do Phinny the next time we try him(not to mention that FD pullin phinny is a death trap for monks).  Our biggest problem was that our approach to pulling him was incorrect and I apoligize for that.<br>
<br>
Originally there are 4 seahorses in the room with Phinny.  These are on 18 minute timers, eachtime you kill a seahorse two guardians spawn.  Therefore to kill Phinny with brute force we need to be able to kill 4 seahorses and eight guardians in 18 minutes, before handling phinny.  This isnt really very viable.  During the CR i got to scout out Phinnys lair and test a few tricks also.  At our next attempt we will gather at the ledge overlooking his lair and pull him to there.  We will first buff a warrior up to run over his lair which will pull the four seahorses, but not Phinny, and train them to the otehr side of the room.  While the warrior is doing that we will pull Phinny to the ledge and dispatch him there.  IF timed right we can pull the warrior back with CoH, if not we'll need a brave soul to sacrifice theirselves.<br>
<br>
I'm going to try to get another shot at him together next Sunday....that bloated fish has an asswhoopin coming to him<br>

Gather on ledge in Phinny room, one person pulls spines away and another person pulls Phinny to ledge.  The success rate of doing Phinny this way is extemely high.

Thnks to all who did a great job on cr after the wipe, I saw Tek going down and up like hell (and i think he sacrificed himself several times <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and Henklin ... I duno how you managed it to pull the corpses out of the lair but you did it without using one call .. great job <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
One word to pets:<br>
pets worked great down there and as we got 6 horses at a time the pets helped to beat them down one after another. But some mins after this big fight I saw our ( mine and Jassir's) rushing in the lair like mad. I duno why, prolly one horse gated back in the lair healed itself and started to atack again from inside the lair or another explanation could be a very wide AE attack from inside the lair that agroed our pets. But anyhow I saw our pets jumping in and I destroyed it asap (invis is the fastest way to do this) and we got only one horse.<br>
Also thnks to Jassir to give me the shot on the Staff of Elementary Water. It's one piece of our epic but it's also the focus item on our 54er/60er water pets. And as long as we in SGA don't have enough power to get to the 7th isle in air we mages don't even have to think about on our epic (only some dreams <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
After the raid Henklin and Elektra did some exploring in the lair to get E a bone for a 49er spell quest and finally she got it grats E <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (It was very exciting/scary standing at the zone to call you up asap ... and some times it was very very close).

<br>
It's a matter of practice makes perfect.<br>
<br>
Just have a good monk pull the swirlspines in deuces and it will be easy. There are 4 horsies to be pulled, making 2 guardians spawn. Just pull the guardians and phini at the same time (or if possible only phini)<br>
<br>
The two things that make phini a reasonabbly difficult mob is the fact that it is under water and the 18 minute timer on 7 mobs making quick killing a necesity.<br>
<br>
BTW phini can be done by one group of 55+ players if you can get em together :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Milven</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(5/21/01 7:20:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=216.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Kedge</span><hr size=1> Fun and great work.
