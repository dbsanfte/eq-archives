<br>
Orakkus:<br>
<br>
Here are the points on which we agree:<br>
<br>
The Trinity, scripturally speaking, is BS, a later invention primarily meant to give Jesus equality to his god.  Also, I would agree that if a single, true god existed, there would probably be one best way in which to worship it, if it cared about that sort of thing.  I think your hypothetical deity has done an abysmal job of presenting this method, not only to those who have access to books presented as revelation but also to the billions over time who have never had access to these books (and who suffer eternal damnation of some sort because of it).<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;[Regarding the immortal soul] This belief came out also from Greek philsophy, and has no scriptural basis whatsoever.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
However, in Matthew 27, following Jesus' crucifixion, graves open, and the bodies of many saints which slept awoke, and they went into the city and appeared unto many.  This event (mentioned nowhere in other gospels or in historical records) seems to contradict your assertion.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Understanding takes time and effort, lots of it. It requires MUCH study. But the reward is great by far and more than worth the effort made.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I've spent a fair amount of time looking into this stuff and find religious belief untenable.  Many thousands of others agree, and many thousands of others find religious belief perfectly valid.  And of the world's many believers over the years, many of these are very well studied, and some had access to materials which modern day folks do not.  And yet these &quot;MUCH studied&quot; individuals come to conclusions different than your own even when examining the same texts and professing the same general beliefs.  You can claim special revelation all you'd like and profess exceptional adherence to the bible and decry others as non-Christians, but again, there is *no* reason for anyone to believe you are right and they are wrong. You can pull scriptures from all over to prove your point, and others can do so to prove theirs. The bible is funny that way.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; As far as your archeology lesson, I suggest you do more research, instead of having other people, ones who might not have wisdom in mind, do it for you.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Thanks, but I'll take Biblical Archaeological Review over the Watchtower any day.  Actual evidence means far more to me than someone's arrogant belief in their own &quot;wisdom.&quot;<br>
<br>
1) Many civilizations have flood myths, yes, and most vary wildly from the Genesis account.  And many civilizations do not, such as nearby Egypt, which has historical records pre-dating the supposed time of the flood.  There are so many other problems with a global flood it would require far too much room to expound on it.  Scientifically speaking, it couldn't -- and didn't -- happen.<br>
2) It would be impossible to determine that one of the most powerful, pervasive, and historically known nations of the ancient world was a wasteland for 40 years?!  Even if the Egyptians did not keep record of it word would spread throughout the known world of this event.  <br>
3) You can invoke an Argument of Silence if you wish, but I do find it unusual that 2-3 million people living in an area the size of WV for 40 years (or whatever) left no trace.  It's akin to the Mormon claim of the state of the Americas in those times, for which no evidence has ever been uncovered.<br>
<br>
And these were just 3 of many topics one could raise.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;To Mandari, I am very familiar with the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses as well as their reasonings, and I suggest that whoever told you this ought to be shot:&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Wow, harsh.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Yes, in their anticipation of this day, they have been a bit presumptious on dates when something might happen, but they have always been quick to adjust their thinking in according to what they understand and learn.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No, they've been quick to adjust their thinking when they've been shown to be *wrong*!  For all their (and your) talk of wisdom and &quot;MUCH study&quot; they predicted the end of the world numerous times (6?) and were *wrong*.  Just as the Mormon church (led by an elder allegedly in direct contact with god and Jesus) were duped by a forger in the 1980s.  Just as many other proclaimers of the end (who were given to wisdom and &quot;MUCH study&quot;) were wrong.  Of course, maybe the preterists are correct and the 2nd Coming happened back in 70 AD.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;First off, I cannot even understand any point of those who believe in evolution. Our entire internet infrastructure does not have the complexity of a simple plant, yet a roll of the dice is all it took for it to pop up one day. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You might want to devote MUCH study to biology before trying to discuss it.  Simple chance and a roll of the dice wasn't involved.  You may have noticed that combining certain elements/substances always yields the same result.  Factor this forward and you might imagine the beginnings of life.  In any case, that's abiogenesis; evolution is a somewhat different issue.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The only rebuttal I have for that is that they only thought themselves Christian. Such a thing the True God would not have santioned.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I find that the &quot;True God&quot; sanctioned quite a bit in the Old Testament.  No amount of bloodshed was too much; the entire Book of Joshua is nothing but a god-ordained bloodbath.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Several prophesies are mentioned in the Bible for example that have historical backing. True, we don't have historical backing for every prophesy, but we do have enough to give credance to the Bible.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I strongly disagree and have yet to see a single specific prophecy clearly fulfilled by a writer known to have lived prior to the time of the prophecy's fulfillment.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Okay Realwing.. prove it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Why?  His assertion has at least as much supportive evidence as the majority of your own.  While the idea of blissful human existence without religion seems a bit far-fetched due to simple human nature and scarce resources, we already know that religion fails as a governing device.  I don't think replacing it with, say, secular humanism would be a bad move at all.  <br>
<br>
Torcer:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Trust me when I say that if Christians haven't convinced my ancestors over the last 2,000 years that thier God is the right one, then your not going to do it on the Graffe message boards.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
A lot of that wasn't about convincing your ancestors of anything, but punishing them for their alleged role in the execution of Jesus.  A couple lines in the New Testament in particular provoked this reprisal, such as Matthew 27:25: Then answered all the people (the Jews), His blood be on us, and on our children.&quot;  <br>

I'm sure there are Christians who will tell me this is because I'm merely human and cannot comprehend the ineffable nature of the divine (and stuff). I don't buy that either. While there are many things we do not understand, I have yet to be convinced that there is anything inherently unknowable.<br>
<br>
Were I, for the sake of argument, to accept the concept of such a being...I find it unlikely in the extreme that an entity able to shape universes, to create matter/energy from the void and breathe the spark of life into this far-flung cosmos would be concerned with the worship or obedience of the tiny mote that is our species. Talk about micromanagement. <br>
<br>
If I am incorrect, and there is in fact such a being who does in fact find it so important that I acknowledge and worship it, there are a thousand ways in which I could be convinced. Letters of fire 300 feet high across the Cascade mountain range saying something along the lines of, &quot;I am the Lord, believe in me and my works&quot; would do it quite handily.<br>
<br>
Faith? You mean this alleged creator, who knows all and loves all and has power over all not only demands my worship but insists I must produce it by intuiting the existence of its object or accepting beyond reason the quasi-evidence of some ancient texts, translated through unnumbered permutations?<br>
<br>
If I am in fact the product of some deliberate act of creation (beyond my parents' hanky-panky), then I was created with the capacity for reason. If there is in fact such a thing as sin, I would have to suppose that refusal to use my reason might well qualify. <p>Chesse Shardic<BR>

    When it comes right down to it..no I really don't care what you believe, you have just as much right to worship whatever god you want as the next guy.  I will agree that the concept of &quot;good&quot; is subjective; therefore I will give my definition....as long as you don't hurt yourself or anyone else, or infringe on their right to be an individual and believe the things that they choose to, then you are a good person.  <br>

Science is based upon logic, and observation.  Religion isn't.  The two can coexist peacefully, and do in many cases.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  However, I pose this question to you: in the end, how is science any more valid than religion? It allows us to observe and measure certain things about the workings of the day-to-day universe, but the most fundamental questions remain unanswered--where did the universe come from? How did it begin, and why? What is consciousness, or free will, for that matter?

Your last sentence is the answer to your own question.  Any day some new discovery might come along and prove all of it wrong.  Also scientists are trying to discover these things.  In religion it is just accepted by &quot;faith&quot;.  <br>

If you read science fiction stories, there is a very good series of books that uses that.  The Orion series by Ben Bova- Orion, Vengence of Orion, Orion in the Dying Time, Orion and the Conqurer, and Orion Among the Stars.  A brief summation:Orion is the hunter who was created by the &quot;Gods&quot; to hunt down and Kill the Neanderthals on Earth to make room for the humans.  The humans take hold and evolve into beings of pure energy who can manipulate Matter/Energy/Time by sheer willpower.  Who in turn create the humans that evolve into them.  That is a very brief summary of the first book Orion.  The rest of the books deal with mostly the same issues with Orion bouncing to different places and Times to deal with each &quot;crisis&quot;.<br>

I'm curious Phuong - why shouldn't we use our &quot;logic&quot; to determine things?  If god gave us logic don't you think he Might have wanted us to use it?

<br>
&lt;&lt;Once again I see you are using your logic to determine things. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
And once again I am seeing, &quot;Just believe it without thought!&quot;  from you.  Like I've said before, I'm not turning off my brain for anyone.  If your omnipotent and omniscient deity cannot string together events and such logically *and* clearly, then it is incompetent, a rider of the divine short bus.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You actually are taking things way out of context here.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You're going to have to show me, and the readers, how before any of us will believe it.  Trust me, I read the full chapters of every verse you cited.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;So you feel that the woman needed to be stoned if the law says she should be stoned.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No, I do not.  However, your deity, *who gave those laws* obviously felt she should be stoned, just as the man was stoned for picking up sticks (God's Justice at work).  Jesus contravened those laws in defiance with the mandates of his deity.  Since Christians equate Jesus with God (via the Trinity), there is a biblical contradiction of values.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;To a man in a jungle knowing of a creator but not knowing how to reach him &quot;Remember Acts&quot; God had someone go to preach to him then he got baptised.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Okay, so who preached to the pre-Columbian Amerindians?  To the pre-Marco Polo Chinese?  Etc.  According to your beliefs, all of these people, and billions more, are damned because they did *not* have a chance.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You have to remember When was daniel written? and When was revelation written? Both men saw the same creature and they have never met.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I once wrote a story that was very Mark Twainish.  And it's amazing, he and I never met!  Biblical scholars place Daniel at 2nd Century BC and Revelations at around 120 AD.  I'm willing to bet one of them just might have read the other.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Each gospel is written by diffrent people yet the compliment each other.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well, they compliment each other in that they're talking about the same story.  But each of them includes some things and omits others and occasionally contradict one another.  And then there are the gospels you never hear about (Thomas, Peter, Mary, Hebrews and other books), which tell a whole number of other things.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;In your lifetime I promise you shall see God's mighty hand move.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Ironically, this is exactly what Jesus and Paul told their followers (in regards to the 2nd coming), and it still hasn't happened.  Of course, you view a visit to a message board as an act of god, so I think our standards vary.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Actually my work here is just about done as far as posting goes I have given enough evidence and answered clearly.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You haven't presented a shred of evidence that I haven't rebutted, and your answers ...what answers?  I haven't seen many of them that had some kind of valid  justification to them.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You have to understand that IF God right no wanted to wipe out America and everyone he would be just to do so b/c he is God and can do what he wants. God is Holy bottom line.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well sure, he ordered the extermination of the Amalekites, Midianites and others.  Why not us, too?  Your deity has always demonstrated an enjoyment for spilled blood.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The law was given so that we could see just how sinful we actually are. There is no way any normal man could fullfill the law God had to fulfill it himself.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I wonder how US citizens would react if Congress passed laws requiring people to levitate everywhere they go.  This is silliness.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Let me also point out that I haven't seen another other religious organization heal anyone at all. Haven't heard of it or read it anywhere but the healing Jesus did is well documented in other places besides the bible.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You haven't looked very hard.  Hindu gurus do it all the time (though I don't believe they really do, they have a lot of tricks).  What you must understand is that the gospels, like much of the Bible, are *stories*, much like the myths of other religions.  Also, very charismatic people can inspire beliefs in others that are just not so, especially in the extremely superstitious times of the past.  If you don't believe it, I have a refreshing glass of Kool-Aid for you.<br>
<br>
And where else other than the bible is this healing documented?  I don't recommend bringing in Flavius Josephus' Antiquities.  That portion of chapter 18 is well known to be a later interpolation.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I have nothing to gain by typing here could have just looked and kept going but decided to reveal some things to ya.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You've revealed some of the inner workings of blind faith, and for that I thank you.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Why didn't you mention the rest of it in Luke. It's Luke 6:1-11. Read the whole thing that you might get understanding.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well, I didn't mention it because I didn't know the verse (as I stated).  I get 2 things from these verses.  1) David also broke the law (and did so many times -- Bathsheba anyone? -- but was still god's favorite).  2)  In verse 9 Jesus says, &quot;Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?&quot;  According to Numbers 15, destroying life is just fine.  I hope you now have understanding.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I am sorry I should have broken down Luke 8:18&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Wow, any parts of the Bible can make perfect logical sense!  All you have to do is add words to it!<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;That is really broken down there that is actually very good [<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ]&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I really hope you can see the problem with this.  &quot;Broken down&quot; is an appropriate description of your means of biblical exegisis.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Also read Mark 10:1-12 that is a rich section when he is instructing on marriage and divorce.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I'd rather you responded to my responses instead of pointing out that Jesus doesn't like divorce.  We kinda knew that.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;God is Love yes but he is also a God of Justice. He is God and can do what he wants when he wants. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well, now we know Phuong's answer to the Euthyphro Dilemma, heh.  &quot;Good&quot; is arbitrary.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You just fail to realize how hostile people were then. People were so full of zeal you would be killed for preaching the Gospel. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Oftentimes by other Christians.  I assure you, I'm well-acquainted with history.  Several emperorers of the Roman Empire ordered the destruction of Christians and other non-official cults.  But most emperors considered them a schismatic cult of the Jews and didn't care so long as they paid taxes.  Yes, Christians had it hard then, on occasion, and have it hard now, on occasion.  And they dealt out their own share of suffering during the intervening 1700 years.  I'm beginning to *suspect* that maybe religion *isn't* such a good thing after all!<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Much like Islam does and is doing. They believe America is the devil and ther ultimate goal is to wipe out Christianity that is hardcore truth.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No no no, see, those aren't *real* Islamics!<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Also I hear alot of people saying &quot;Well you don't have to go to church you can just pray at home.&quot; Try this one Hebrews 10:25&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
And Jesus told a questioner not to pray in public as the Pharisees do (showing off their faith), but to pray in private.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;As far as John 7 goes you still have to read and understand. Read the ENTIRE chapter 8P then you will get the point.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You keep saying &quot;read this, read that&quot; but you don't care to explain much (except where you added nonexistent text).  The *point* is that Jesus lied.  He said he wasn't going, and then he went.  This is why some editors added the word &quot;yet&quot;  to John 7:8.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Election or free will?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I submit that there can be no free will if the deity running the show is *both* omniscient and the creator.  For at the moment of creation it knows the sum total of all events yet to transpire, and creates the universe in a manner matching that total knowledge.  A corollary of omniscience is omnipresence, meaning that right now (as god perceives 'now'), god is experiencing existence in heaven with all people that have been and all that will be.  Including you, if you get to go.  I consider the above far more easily justified than what you have written.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Once again you are misunderstanding what the man is saying in Romans. I will just pray and hope you get an understanding before you leave this planet. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't rebut what you said so I'll just tell you that you don't understand and have to pray until you agree with me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Love to all and Thormir my friend I feel you have some other issues to deal with in yourself.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Ah, there it is, wondered when the &quot;something must be wrong with you&quot; reply would come (it inevitably does).  Phuong, my friend, I think you have traded one set of addictions for another set.  While the new bunch may not be as destructive as the old, it certainly is as irrational.  I shall continue to hope that you learn *reason* as opposed to blind faith muddled by hampered understanding.<br>
<br>
While ultimately it is up to other readers to determine the validity of your comments versus my own, I honestly don't see where you have given the slightest bit of evidence to support your beliefs.  Your citation of the bible mostly served only to expose more injustices, questionable ethics and contradictions.  There are very very good reasons why people such as myself don't believe what you believe.  I hope you shall explore them.<br>
<br>
You and I are both atheists.  I just go one god further.<br>

<br>
Qeylin, long time no see!  I hope you're doing well!  Here are my thoughts on your comments.<br>
<br>
First, I believe that the writers of the bible's many books wanted to be taken literally.  The OT writers wanted to show the law, have the Jews obey the law, present great heroes and examples for the Jews, show what happened when the Jews disobeyed the law, and finally cry out against the enemies of the Jews with promises of their god's upcoming vengeance.  NT writers wanted to propagate belief in a savior.  But you're right, they were primitive folks with primitive beliefs, and over time the bible has changed a bit via translations, scribing errors, etc.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;A few things remain constant: the underlying theme of the Bible is, ultimately, to  be a good person: that is, respect others, do unto them as you would have them do unto you, etc., etc. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I disagree.  the *subject* of the bible is the covenant between man and god.  In the OT this covenant was exclusively with the Hebrews, and in the NT god decided to open his doors to all.  The covenant tells you how to be a good person in this god's eyes, but as I've shown previously, being &quot;good&quot; sometimes involves some pretty bad stuff (e.g., killing the guy for picking up sticks).<br>
<br>
The *theme* of the bible is seen in almost every book.  Exceptions include Esther (where god isn't mentioned) and Song of Solomons (poetic sex).  This theme is simple but pervasive:  &quot;Obey or suffer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;However, I pose this question to you: in the end, how is science any more valid than religion?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Science is more valid because it *works*.  It works in a manner both demonstrable and replicable, and usually observable.  This is why you'd probably prefer a doctor to a faith healer, for instance.  <br>
<br>
Unanswered questions don't mean much.  Science has answered questions for centuries and will continue to do so.  Maybe it will never answer all the questions, but it will try using things like observation and evidence, as opposed to just deciding such and such is what happened.  And some questions science is not meant to answer, such as questions of ethics.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Why is science the way it is, why are the physical laws such elegant, orderly things?  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Because if they weren't the universe would not be able to sustain itself beyond the first minute or so of its existence. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;More importantly, why must there be a division between science and religion in the first place? &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Very complicated question.  The late Stephen Jay Gould (famed paleontologist, died days ago) argued that religion and science occupied two distinct &quot;magisteria&quot; which could co-exist without intrusion.  I disagree, seeing that religion very often intrudes, and perhaps necessarily intrudes in order to maintain its belief system.  I strongy recommend this article (which I found linked from Penn &amp; Teller's website).  It is written by Richard Dawkins (famed evolutionary biologist, thankfully still alive), and presents a position I am in complete agreement with.  Enjoy.<br>

<br>
I'll use your own logic against you: prove it.  ;p<br>
<br>
As for your comments regarding the merits of science, consider this.  No one is going to argue with you about the tensile strength of steel, or the fact that sodium and chlorine react to make table salt, or what have you.  The Bible isn't a guide to How Stuff Works, it is--<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> primarily</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->--a code of laws and moral standards.  Even in Genesis, the actual <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> process</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of Creation is never clearly defined.  My question wasn't really regarding that the simple, easily-observed, everyday science you're thinking of.  The science regarding the nature of Creation itself is entirely theoretical--most of it has NOT been observed, and is, in fact, mere conjecture.  The Big Bang is not scientific fact, it is an educated hypothesis based on what little we know about the nature of the universe today.  You take it on faith that it's true because, yes, in the past science has proven very reliable in these things--I don't refute that.  However, the theories regarding creation are so far removed from what is &quot;observable&quot; that you can't really claim to know what's going on.<br>
<br>
Regarding the nature of physics:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ...Because if they weren't the universe would not be able to sustain itself beyond the first minute or so of its existence.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's rather pretentious of you.  &quot;Our way is the only way?&quot;  Hmm.  You have absolutely NO frame of reference outside of our own laws of physics.  How could you possibly claim to know that the set of laws we obey is the only one that would work?<br>
<br>
Also, you say that science and religion can't coexist peacefully.  I'll offer an amendment to this:  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> fundamentalism</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and science cannot coexist.  There are many religious people that are very capable of applying the laws of science to their faith.<br>
<br>
Well, I suppose that's enough for now.  I don't really feel like making another long post, so I'll close with this: &quot;each to their own, so long as they harm no one.&quot;  I respect you for your adamant support of science--now, please, respect others for their own opinions on the matter, and we won't have any problems with each other. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uluxum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/23/02 12:43:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=143>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God and Religion (OT)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> That's rather pretentious of you. &quot;Our way is the only way?&quot; Hmm.

Umm well yes, mathematically we do have a frame of reference for physics other than the set which we know work in our universe.  With string theory there are formulas in development which do in fact describe universes with completely different rules than our own, and they tend to describe universes which collapse on themselves immediately or have other strange properties.

<br>
Actually, that was someone else's &quot;logic.&quot;  I don't feel that I can *prove* anything.  However, I've read the vast majority of the bible (from Gen to 2 Cor, lazily plodding through the rest), and my impression is that the writers most definitely wished to be taken literally, with the likely exception of the writer of Song of Solomon.  The minor prophets in particular were quite emphatic in expressing the plight of the Hebrew people and the impending divine vengeance due their captors. <br>
<br>
More importantly, much of what is written does not lend itself well to symbolic interpretations.  It seems clear that the writers recorded what they considered history, or in many cases what they wanted the people to consider history.  <br>
<br>
There, at least, is some support for my position.  Obviously not hardcore scientific evidence, but I never claimed to have that.  Why do you differ in your view?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; The Big Bang is not scientific fact, it is an educated hypothesis based on what little we know about the nature of the universe today. You take it on faith that it's true because, yes, in the past science has proven very reliable in these things&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Actually, I don't take it on faith that it's true.  I simply recognize that it is currently the best scientific explanation for the beginning of the universe.  It could very well not be the case, and that's fine.  <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;That's rather pretentious of you. &quot;Our way is the only way?&quot; Hmm. You have absolutely NO frame of reference outside of our own laws of physics. How could you possibly claim to know that the set of laws we obey is the only one that would work?&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
No need to use such strong language, Qeylin, relax.  My answer was, admittedly, tongue in cheek.  Suffice to say it's unlikely we'd be around to notice a difference in physical laws (though another life form might).  Luxum replied appropriately.  There is no reason to believe that our laws are the only possible physical laws.  Their &quot;elegance&quot; is fascinating, but I see no reason to evoke supernatural origins for them, if that's what you're going for.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;There are many religious people that are very capable of applying the laws of science to their faith.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
What do you mean by &quot;applying the laws of science to their faith?&quot;  If you mean they go to the doctor when ill, that's fine, no argument there.  If you mean they claim to have the weight of the 'human soul' or something...  Anyway, religion regularly creeps into the scientific arena.  Read the article I linked to previously; it's quite good.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; I respect you for your adamant support of science--now, please, respect others for their own opinions on the matter, and we won't have any problems with each other.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Was I showing disrespect somewhere?  Have you confused discussion/debate with disrespect?  If you care to know, I respect my counterparts at least in that they've presented their positions calmly and without the &quot;UR GOING TOO HELL&quot; attitude I've seen in many other forums and RL.  Hopefully they accord me the same respect.  Disagreement does not necessitate mudslinging.<br>

Well more specifically, it is a unified field theory, based off of some complicated mathematics.  It can make the fields we know of behave in remarkably flexible ways by shifting variables, and i don't doubt that eventually someone will tweak it, simplify it, or find the right value to the variables to find a mathematical version of the laws we see functioning in our universe.  If not with string theory, than with some other theory.  The validity of string theory for describing our universe was not at issue, what was at issue was whether it would be possible to know another set of laws of physics other than those of our own universe, and that is exactly what string theory is. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uqeylinspellbinder.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qeylin Spellbinder</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/23/02 2:21:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=147>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> Not trying to fling mud, just trying to stress a point.<br>

Anyway, after much consideration on the subject, I've come to one conclusion:<br>
<br>
This is all pointless to argue anyway. Who's up for a drink? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
LOL of course it's pointless man.  This is a debate, it's what we do around here when we aren't making baseless attacks on druids!  As message boards go, this is a great place to debate even such heady subjects since most people stay calm and refrain from flaming.  Well, unless Noonie is involved, but that's another story.<br>
<br>
I personally think there is something to all these world religions, especially where they agree.  I think most, if not all of them, have also been corrupted over the years by the political organiziations that have kept them alive.  Nevertheless, there is value there, just as there is value in the study of science.  And most interesting of all are the places where science and religions agree.<br>

Can't use your own intellegence to try and &quot;figure out&quot; what the bible even says.  You will get confused our take it out of context.<br>
<br>
My stand is this:  God is God and does what he wants when he wants and how he wants to do it.  If he feels fit to kill me where I sit I accept it.  I owe God everything he owes me nothing.  You are right I do have an addiction his name is Jesus the Christ.  Once again you are correct I have traded one set for another I traded my sin for grace.  <br>
<br>
I have given an account of what I believe you have given what you believe.  It's up to you to believe or not.  My work is done.<br>
<br>
If you still fail to understand what I am saying or just really don't care and think it's silly that cool also.<br>
<br>
I feel great knowing I came among you all and stated what I believe.<br>
<br>
Once again any questions direct them to sufanius@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Also my comment about problems or issues within yourself.  My friend we all have issues within ourselves every single person that reads this every single person on this planet has problems and issues they need to overcome.  <br>
<br>
Wait PhuongMasters00 has issues and problems he needs to overcome?   Yes.  Wait aren't you a Christian?  Yes I am.  Being born again doesn't mean things just automatically get better.  You gradually get to the place God wants you to be.  Grace is availible for all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ustumpeyfyzzbang.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stumpey Fyzzbang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/27/02 6:52:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=154>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.prodigy.net/cohmsford/america.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Please search...</span><hr size=1> I intentionally did not read this for a week, because as I said earlier, I think this is a horrible place to try to &quot;witness&quot; to people.  So, I am not going to get into all the details and argue with you all.<br>
<br>
Please do not post a &quot;Look, he cannot even defend his position&quot; answer.  I can, and I do.  I have heard all the points made here, and more, and am more firm in my faith than 4 years ago, when I first came to Christ (after being raised Catholic but not believing and leaving the church and all things related to it for a decade).<br>
<br>
When I did come to believe, it was based on what I believe to be the most likely answer to a single question:  Was Jesus raised from the tomb?  I did not want to believe that, but after spending two years looking into it, I was convinced.  I cannot, and will not try to convince anyone of the same thing on a message board for one simple reason:  it would never have worked for me, so I do not presume to think it would work for you.  I understand where many of you are coming from more than you think.<br>
<br>
The reason I jumped into this fracas was to try to impress one simple fact.  It is the fact that made me want to know the truth if I could.  That fact is that there might be a single absloute truth about God, and about what He wants from us, and that if such a truth exists, I wanted to know it.<br>
<br>
I know, I know.  There might not be a single truth about God.  Maybe there are many gods.  Maybe God is so incomprehensible that all the religions we see are simply our primitive way of trying to deal with it.  Maybe God did give us some truth and, being human, we have messed it all up.<br>
<br>
Then again, maybe not.<br>
<br>
I pray (I hope that does not bother anyone<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) that you all will take the issue seriously.  That is all I can ask.  I just hope that you do not decide an answer on this issue without considering it carefully.  I do not know if it is because of the wizard thing, the eq thing, the computer thing, or what, but you are some of the best spoken, well reasoned people I have read in a long time.  Do not let that get in the way of your search.   And do search.  I am not asking you to take my word for anything.  My word is meaningless.  I just ask that you all will not simply take someone else's word, either.<br>
<br>
This has been a great thread to read.  I commend all of you on keeping a topic that can be so devisive this civil.<br>
<br>
I will not be posting any more here, because as I said this is not a place to witness anymore than what I have said.  <br>
<br>
God bless all of you.<br>
