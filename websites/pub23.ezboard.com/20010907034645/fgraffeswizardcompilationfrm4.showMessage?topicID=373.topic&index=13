<br>
i guess what i was trying to sum up in the first post was this:<br>
on what basis do you think we as wizards are getting screwed?  where is it written that wizards have to have X ability to be a &quot;wizard&quot;?  can't VI make them as they see fit?  i mean come on, its their game.  can't they make it the way they want?  its a free country.  they put a product in front of us and if we like it, we buy it.  if we don't, we simply but it back on the shelf and choose another.<br>
<br>
Everquest is a game that YOU went to the store and bought for $29.95.  its not a freakin brand new car that has a warranty stating that if you aren't satisfied you had the right to demand service.  VI made no promises to anyone playing this game nor will it ever do so.  do you have the option to make suggestions?  sure.  but the attitude i notice from a lot of players after reading these boards for almost 2 years is that we can demand that they &quot;fix&quot; us and if they don't, they are stealing our money.  it's like you think Verant &quot;owes&quot; us something.  its so funny to see the responses after they change something.  i think some people are actually outraged and really get pissed of in real life.  <br>
<br>
i find it humorous.<br>

<br>
As I've said before, yep yep yep, it's their game.  They can do with it as they please.<br>
<br>
I suggest they change it for a couple reasons:<br>
-Other games ruled with wizzies as powerful nukers, or awesome buffers/enchanters/utility people.  Before you put your foot in your mouth and bite my head off, note I said SUGGEST.  Other games did it well, it can work for EQ too.  SUGGESTION.<br>
<br>
-It's kinda expected.  This is a fantasy game.  Fantasy is generally build on D&amp;D, books, legends, and such.  Again, SUGGESTION.  It's an &quot;expectation&quot; simply because it's in the foundations of the genre.  If they want to make it different, that's FINE, it's their game.  It's my SUGGESTION because I like it the original way better. =)<br>
<br>
-They told us different from what we got.  At least in my opinion.  This is a quote from the EQ website.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wizards are second to none when it comes to casting powerful offensive spells.&quot;<br>
Mages are not far behind at all.  Wanna argue? Go look at the spell lists and compare.  No, not 100% of the time, but there isn't a large notable difference.  Large being the keyword.  &quot;Second to none&quot; means large in my head.  Seems like it's a notable difference.  I love being redundant.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Certainly, other magic users are proficient in their own areas, but the wizard is most effective in battle.       &quot;<br>
Yeah.  They just fixed that with the lures, etc.  Hadn't been true for 50+ for a long time, from what I understand.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is, as long as they have someone very sturdy to protect them from melee attacks.&quot;<br>
Generally always true.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me add to this: the original description told of wizzies as being the &quot;heavy artillery.&quot;  I remember that quote.  That also means &quot;much better than the 2nd best nuker&quot; to me.  This is not apparent to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's their game.  They can do what they wish.  Even if they told us otherwise.  I'm suggesting that they make certain changes to bring more balance and uniqueness to wizzies as a class.  And no, I'm not being a self certered little kid, I believe they should make changes to other classes as well.  This, however, is a wizzie forum, thus I post my wizzie related ideas. =)<br>
<br>
Flame me, whip me, beat me.  I'll always be back for more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
