<br>
First off, it's difficult to argue this issue, only becuase there isn't enough research done as of yet to determine the exact detrimental effects of pot on the human body.  Saying pot kills brain cells is indeed a misnomer, becuase in many  studies the drug to shown to *restructure* brain cells as opposed to *destory* brain cells.  What we do know about pot is that does the following:<br>
<br>
Changes brainwave patterns, which in-turn effect how motor skills and perception are handled by the brain, this is why you get impared when you smoke pot, etc...nothing new.<br>
<br>
Marijuana is made up of many chemicals, the primary one being THC.  THC directly effects the brain and central nervous system, when it finally reaches the brain it takes awhile to be purged becuase it stores itself in fatty tissue, sometimes for 3-5 days, thus prolonging *the high*. There is alot of stuff that isn't known about why it takes so long to purge outta the body...(long term effects)<br>
<br>
Becuase pot is inhaled, respiratory risks do exist.  Cancer causing agents *do* exist in pot smoke and can cause problems in the long term.  <br>
<br>
Pot effects the endocrine system, and does effect growth hormones in younger teens.  It's been proven that a reduced amout of estrogen and testosteron are produced during periods of smoking pot, which can interrupt the development of the human body at these hormone dependant stages.  Which can lead to lower sperm counts, and interrputed menstral cycles in women.<br>
<br>
Marijuana effects chemicals that effect mood and attention.  It cuases reduced concentration, memory loss, and reduces logical thinking and calculation skills.  So basically, driving a car is something you shouldn't be doing.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, the things I just listed are facts about marijuana.  This what we currently know about it.  We may not know *everything* about this particular drug, nor can I say if it's worse than alcohol.  There is so much that isn't known about this drug I can't see why that fact alone isn't enough to NOT do this, especially the people who this effects most, ie younger people, heavy users, and pregnant women.  <br>
<br>
There are so many things in the world that you have to worry about killing you, why bother putting something else in your body you don't know completely about?  <br>
<br>
Anyway, this isn't a political discussion, nor am I debating the politics of pot.  The bottom line of this is as long as it's illegal, people will be doing it, if it becomes legal, people will be doing it.  To me if the devil exists, it's better to accept it and educate people about him, instead of trying to prove that he doesn't exist, ie they should legalize pot for no other reason than it can't be proven that it's any worse than Alcohol, which is legal.<br>
<br>
<br>
I personally don't do pot, nor do I advocate doing pot, but it is painfully obvious that Marijuana is no better than a drug that is legal already, ie Alcohol.  To me, that's just hypocritical.<br>
<br>

Not going to dispute this as I agree with you. I did once hear that a study was done that showed people that smoked cigarettes and pot lived longer then those that smoke cigarettes alone. I do not know if there is any truth to this, was just something that I heard that I thought was interesting. /shrug <br>

This I have not heard of even though I have studied marijuana failry extensively however I would not advocate ANY chemical influence on a body that is still developing. Caffine, nicotine, TCH or any other altering chemicals. <br>

Actually it was a political discussion for the most part to me. It is illegal for one reason...money. <br>

Alcohol is definitively worse then marijuana. Just the confirmed deaths associated with each confirm this. Not to mention, how many drunk assholes have you met in your life? People that may be fine when sober but beat the dog when drunk. I have NEVER met a habitual pot smoker that acts that way. <br>
<br>
While I was a smoker I went through 5 years alcohol free, now that I no longer smoke I do enjoy an occasional beer but getting drunk alters me in a negative fashion that pot never did, a fashion that I do not enjoy. I would always choose to smoke rather then drink if it were not for the fact that it is illegal.<br>
<br>
I want to clarify one thing, I am not advocating the use of pot and I think we all know I am certainly not condemning it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     To each their own and weather you try it or not is an individual decision but when I hear the cries of &quot;it destroys your brain and it's illegal&quot; I feel compelled to point out that it is illegal for reasons far different then what most believe. <br>
<br>
BTW as a pot smoker I found myself to be intelligent and logical. I held down a good job, paid my bills and lived life in a responsible manner. As an ex-smoker I have seen no increase in my mental abilities, I have not become MORE responsible, I hold down a good job and I pay my bills and live life in a responsible manner. I think a lot of the &quot;stoner&quot; behavior stereotypes exist not because pot makes you stupid but because some that smoke were idiots in the first place. I have smoked with doctors and nurses, lawyers and even a judge. Some of the smartest people I know are tokers. Some of the smartest people I know have never touched it. Draw whatever conclusions you want from that.<br>
<br>
 I chose to give it up because of the legal ramifacations. My son was born 3 years ago and even though I do not feel that being a smoker was detrimental to my life, the fact remains that it could cause seperation from my son if I were caught and that is not acceptable. <br>
