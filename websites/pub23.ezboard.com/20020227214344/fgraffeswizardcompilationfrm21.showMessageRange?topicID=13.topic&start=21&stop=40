After being gone for the better part the last month, I came back and found that in my abscence, many wizards have finally begun to understand what true power they possess with their AE spells.  For the most part, this is an excellent development as wizards are able to have a lot more fun and no longer have to rely on ignorant tanks wielding novelty light sabres or redecorated dragoon dirks to protect them from mobs.  However, a few of these newly enlightened wizards have actually had the gall to claim that they possess a mastery AE far greater than any other wizard who ever lived.  For the most part this is limited to a few arogant inkies and erudites.  <br>
<br>
To them I say, MOOOO.  Such large egos they have; their caraniums enlarging while their brain size remains the same.  With their 20 mob trains and cries of amazement from awestruck tanks that happen to witness an AE pull, these wizards seem to think they're hot stuff.  Excuse me for bursting your bubble, but impressing a meleer that has spent most of their life running to the zone screaming anytime they see more than 1 mob comming towards them, is easier than stealing candy from a severely retarded 2 year old blind girl. <br>
<br>
So in an effort not only to reassert my dominance and the dominance of the high elven race, but to put these silly wannabe wizards back in their place, I set out to create the greatest train derailment ever seen.  I gathered up the 2 best high elf wizards I could find, the 2 best high elf enchanters, and of course, the greatest of all high elf clerics, and went to Sebilis.  After paying a small pittance of 2 platinum pieces to a lonely and groupless druid outside of Sebilis for a sow, we headed in.  Being as late as it was, Sebilis was relatively empty.  Our group ran down to the 3 spawn, the zone frogs close on our tail.  As soon as they got there, the chanters began casting their stuns.  <br>
<br>
As the slow frogs from the zone lumbered their way towards the circle of death, all 3 wizards and the cleric set out to their predetermined pull locations. First the cleric zoomed off towards chef.  Then after counting to 4, I took off for the disco rooms.  The next wizard then ran down to the NJ rooms, and the last wizard waited just a bit before going and grabing the close frogs from NG and portal.  The staggered pull start times worked perfectly, with all the pullers arriving back to the 3 spawn within a period of no longer than 5 seconds between the first and the last puller.  As we turned around to watch, a gigantic horde of frogs bounced towards us, intent on our destruction.  The cleric cast a group heal and the wizards each prepared to unleash the fury of jyll upon the crowd of frogs.  But the chanters, being as uber as they were, kept the situation under complete control, and seeing this, the wizards quickly ran back out to try and get as many straglers and lost frogs as they could grab before the enchanters succumbed to the onslaught of frogs, beetles, and golems.  This wasn't just going to be a big train, but the greatest train of all time.<br>
<br>
So there we were, running our pasty white elven butts off trying to gather even more mobs while the enchanters attempted to juggle something that, by any other standard, would be an impossible amount of work.  I ran back down to the disco room and found at least 7 frogs who had failed to give chase when I first ran through.  So I ran around to each one, sometimes going as far as to tickle them on the nose (ya, I really do have &quot;/poke say tickles %t on the nose&quot; hotkeyed) to get their attention.  As I scrambled back up towards the zone I was stunned in the back, which gave the frogs chasing me enough time to catch up.  As soon as I was able to move I began running and jumping like my life depended on it (well actually I guess my life did depend on it) toward the zone.  Unfortunately as I got the the bridge between the portal and disco hallway, I was stunned again.  The frogs pounded me in the ass making me really regret my earlier decision to not purchase a pair of metal undies from the local blacksmith in order to save a little money.  So after being beaten to just about 1 bubble of health I was unstunned and ran screaming towards the 3 spawn, as my arse continuted to be pounded along the way.<br>
<br>
When I finally arrived back within the enchanters circle of protection I was at less than half a bubble of health.  As I turned around, I saw, charging towards me, a froglok bok knight with its arm raised high in the air ready to swing down.  And then... it hit me.  I fell to the ground and found myself floating above my own body, looking down from above as some 50+ frogs swarmed the tiny band of high elves.  But then, by some maricle that most certainly must have been the divine intervention of Mithannial Marr himself, the cleric landed a heal on me, raising me from the dead.(Damn good thing I decided to worship a dude that can heal, think Solusek ro would have saved me?)  The frog had beaten me within an inch of my life, literally, as that was about how much purple health bar I had left as I lay bleeding to death on the ground.<br>
<br>
Not having too much time to reflect upon how close I had just come to death, I lept to my feet, and felt the power of Jyll beginning to flow through me.  I unleased a massive wave of ice that raidiated out from me damaging everything in its path.  Then the 2 other wizards, just arriving back to the group, began to do the same.  The destruction that took place of the next 60 seconds was incomprehensible.  Towers of fire and ice illuminated the scene as the helpless sebilites could do nothing but stand there, frozen in place.  In the end, the ground was littered with the dead and still burning bodies of frogs, golems, and beetles.  Three more frogs remained standing, clinging to life with their last breath, unable to escape the inevitable.  One by one the last 3 frogs were disposed of until at last, only the high elves remained standing.  <br>
<br>
Unable to count the bodies by simply looking around and counting, each elf counted the number of corpses they looted.  Upon combining the totals, we stood stunned at the feat which we had just accomplished.<br>
<br>
In a battle in which the high elves were outnumbered 54 to 6, the final battle tally:  High Elves 54, Sebilites 0<br>

P.S.  In an unfortunate side note I managed accidently delete my screenshots as I was preparing to upload them so I could post them here.  Hopefully I can get screenshots from another one of the group members so I can post em here.  If not, I'm going to have to wait till I get a chance do this again.

Next head towards the kitchen and pull EVERYTHING on the way and all the parts there.  This is a struggle to get 30, but with the Krups included the XP in nice.<br>

Then last pull is all the way back to the Disco.  Basically, in 3 pulls you've pulled nearly every spawn in the upper portion of Seb except the Crypt.  Of course, often times, at least on Tholuxe, the Guardian is camped so we just skip that.<br>

Considering how easy it is to kite mobs, no need to even bother running trash back to base camp as much. Just gotta hit DA song or auto-dodge when I bring everything home... : )<br>

You are in luck!  I happen to have a log of that session. I'll post it shortly...<br>
<br>
An interesting note: I actually gained experience much faster (almost twice as fast) in another group where we were consistently pulling trains of 15-25 rather than going for the mega pulls.<br>

<br>
my thoughts on that real fast.  How the hell can VI send to live servers a zone with HUGE train capabilities, fast ass respawns, blue mobs to 60 with low resists, and low HP, and not expect anything else than AE to occur? do they think we are dumb and not able to syncronize these groups? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showMessageRange?topicID=13.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showMessageRange?topicID=13.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showMessageRange?topicID=13.topic&start=61&stop=61>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showPrevMessage?topicID=13.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showNextMessage?topicID=13.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.emailToFriend?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.threadControl?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm21.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm39">MOB Resistance Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Spell Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Faction Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Quest Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Item Discussion and Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
