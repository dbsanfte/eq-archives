What I saw bothered me. Of course, I understand that the information I have is from one site only and all spells (as with anything coming out with SOL) may change before release. However, Clerics and Mages seem to be getting 11 new spells. Thats fine, but Wizards are only getting 8. Wizards are getting the same amount of spells as Rangers and Palladins which are hybrid Warrior classes. That seems so wrong to me. <br>
<br>
Not only are we getting one of the lowest amounts of new spells, the spells themselves arent very impressive. Half of them (4), are along the same line. Familiars. They had better be well worth it, because half of our improvement and all we have to look forward to is going to be tied up with them. Sure there is a good 39 nuke and root spell, but the rest is not so hot. A level 58 summoned eye? Comeon, thats all they could think up this whole time? A 56 single target TL to zone SS? I am full of ports and TLs to my eyeballs. More isnt required. A level 12 dmg shield? I dont remember using the one I had in my spell book this whole time, why would I use this one?<br>
<br>
It just seems to me that our spells seem very superficial and not well thought out. Kind of like token spells to make them add up to what they are handing out to Hybrids so that it doesnt look like they ignored us completely. <br>
<br>
We need more techincal changes to our classes to make them more well rounded and just plain revamped to keep up with the new mobs and zones and playstyle that have come out with new content and expansions. These spells just seem like chump spells that are just filling up spell books and dont make me too happy. <br>
<br>
I would like a poll taken by the development teams on the amount of time spent on the various classes. I could guess that most of their time is spent on classes with more depth like mages, necros, clerics, and druids. I bet the smallest fraction is devoted to Wizards. <p><img src=http://userdata.acd.net/Nostromo/Pictures/EQSig1.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udaurion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Daurion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/7/01 8:38:25 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www-edlab.cs.umass.edu/~akielbas/jbravo0.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are we getting the least attention?</span><hr size=1> maybe they heard all those nonuber, sub-50, 'you dont know what it's like to be low level' wizards complaining that all the upgrades are geared for the raiding types :P<br>

I used to say that too.<br>
<br>
Let me have the spell development department for a week and Wizards would get groups.<br>
<br>
Disintegrate would leave a corpse, but cost 2400 Mana.<br>
<br>
Solist's Icy Spear = Level 55<br>
<br>
All draught line spells at level 51 - (Damage 665-985)<br>
<br>
All lure spells at level 51 (Damage 640-900) 100% Unresistable<br>
<br>
Harvest II  Level 51  400-850 mana<br>
<br>
Translocate would work out of group.<br>
<br>
Abscond/Evacuate fizzle rate would be zero for the masters of transportation.<br>
<br>
Sunstrike moved to Level 58<br>
<br>
Bane line spells would no longer need regents and would do 4000 dmg for 600 mana.<br>
<br>
Three Level 60 DDs for Cold/Heat/Magic <br>
  Wrath of Graff - Magic 2000 dmg for 500 mana<br>
  Ire of Solusek Ro - Fire 2000 dmg for 500 mana<br>
  Icy Death - Cold 2000 dmg for 500 mana<br>
<br>
An eye spell cast by a planar level Wizard would be able to move to the plane and see what was there.  Duration of existence would increase per level as well as inherent buffs for the eye.<br>
<br>
And finally, bye bye Atols and Bond's for wizzys.  You don't need em anymore.  You have a group!<br>

i personally don't have any problems playing my wizard (59). i don't want to see radical changes (like many changes proposed on these boards) made to my class<br>
i've played through a lot of aspects of the game (raids, grouping, soloing, fishing, etc) and never encountered problems that made me throw my hands up in the air and say 'i quit' or 'wizards sucks'. sure there have been frustrations, but i've also played a druid, a mage and a warrior...and encountered similar things there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Raids happen after a certain level and its very high level.  Calling some class a 'raid class' as if that somehow justifies being weak and problematic for 50 levels or so is just absurd.

<br>
my comment &quot;screw groups we're a raid class!~&quot; was only half serious, you'll notice that a couple lines down i say that &quot;i've played through a lot of aspects of the game (raids, grouping, soloing, fishing, etc) &quot;. and pls don't start stuff about high levels not knowing what level 30 was like cause it belong in that other thread :P<br>
<br>
i think that the reason why we have different classes in everquest is so that people enjoy and have fun at ALL levels. yes there are problems with the wizard class but we're not unique or special, most of the other classes have problems too.<br>
<br>
as for the proposed group changes above, they strike me more as 'tweaks' and stuff that would unbalance the game then help wizards in groups. look at the list and tell me what what new group friendly ideas are there.<br>
<br>
as to making 'making positive changes to the wizard class', i don't think all the changes i've seen on this board are entirely positive....well because i think wizards are for the most part balanced. <br>
<br>
the reason i posted originally was because i disagreed with the original poster that we were getting the least attention. i prefer to look at it from the angle that they spent enough time looking at our class to decide that we don't need radical changes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Now part of my problem is that I level too slowly (don't play enough) to get &quot;in&quot; with a group of people and stay with them - they always outpace me, so I rely on pickup groups, within or without of my guild.<br>
Mostly pickup groups don't want a wizard because they don't know what I can add.  They will take a paladin's pathetic heal over my huge damage, because they don't realize how quickly I can burn something down.  Now, this is a LOT to do with education of the less intelligent masses.  I have made many friends by showing them how successfull a wiz-mag-bard-pal-rog-ran group can be.  I also know how to direct such a group cause I've done so many of them.  I actually prefer those &quot;odd&quot; combinations.  But many people don't, and I think increasing what we can offer to a group will help show the uninformed masses how worthwhile we are.<br>
I don't think we need a general damage increase - maybe just one that affects us in groups.  I LOVE being a wizard, and wouldn't have it any other way.  I can't wait for higher levels, and higher damage.  I dream of having enough mana to kill myself 10 times over, rather than just 4. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I suppose if our familiars line is really cool and beneficial, then I would have to retract that comment. However, I cant shake thinking of the brainstorming session on our spells going something like this:<br>
<br>
&quot;What do you think of those familiars?&quot;<br>
&quot;Great, lets give them 4 of those.&quot;<br>
&quot;Sweet, well that half of the spells we had to come up with. Good job.&quot;<br>
<br>
I look at the other spell lines and I see the depth to them. New buffs, new DD's, new AE's etc. I see that every aspect was thought about and modified. I just have this nagging feeling that not as much thought is put into our spells. A small dmg shield is useful to a wizard in a narrow range. The roaming eye is only good in very specific situations. The new DD and root is good for a few levels. <br>
<br>
These just seem like little pokes and prods to our class, nothing much of note. Do remember that I am still hoping against hope that the familiars prove me wrong on all of this.<br>

Your logic chain goes like this:<br>
<br>
Wizards are fine.<br>
Wizards are balanced.<br>
Therefore, making changes would unbalance Wizards and thus be bad.<br>
<br>
The problem is your basic presuppositions are not true.  Wizards are NOT fine and NOT balanced.  The basis for your presupposition you stated above:<br>
<br>
Wizards are a raid class and are good then<br>
<br>
Which is true and not true, depending on the level and places you go.  But that's no basis for balance in any demented sense of the concept, and even Verant thankfully understands that.<br>
<br>
Further, the assumption that Wizards are balanced does NOT mean making changes that have been suggested would be bad.  Because almost all the changes suggested are BEFORE the raid level of Wizards, when even by your definition the class is not doing well. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg BORDER=0> at: 8/12/01 7:58:05 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udarret.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darret</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(9/3/01 1:41:59 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are we getting the least attention?</span><hr size=1> God I love reading Grimstaff's posts!<br>
