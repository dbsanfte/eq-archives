I've been trying to get one off and on for two weeks now, but this seemed like a perfect time to try!  The heart drops from an Inferno Goblin Wizard who spawns deep in the bowels of Sol A.  Little did I know that this would be a night of sheer aggravation with small amounts of frustrating bordem thrown in for good measure. <br> <br>I saw my old friend Ostapa on and we talked about taking a shot.  First we ran around and grabbed him some new spells to try out, then we headed to the dungeon.  The two of us invised to try and make it past the lower level creatures at the top and get down to the meat and potatoes at the bottom.  Ostapa pointed out &quot;These are all green to me&quot;.  Maybe Big Juju, God of Verant heard this comment and took exception to it, because all hell broke loose not 15 seconds later!  We made it about 3/4 down the first staircase before a flame goblin wiz saw through our invis, took a potshot at us, and about 6 of his friends joind in beating us senseless.  We evac'd out to NK with little health left to spare. <br> <br>I thought that now would be a good time to throw in the towel for the night, but Ostapa twisted my arm (it didn't take much effort) and we gathered up some Crackskulls for a full blown raid.  Talandia, Moremeat, and Zak joined us and we headed back to Sol A to show those little red assholes who was boss! <br> <br>Big Juju, God of Verant threw us our first curve ball the minute we zoned in.  Moremeat was too big to fit in the dungeon.  DOH!  No problem, we're CRACKSKULLS!  And besides, they're all green!     So, the 4 of us start the trek to the bottom, to take out the Inferno Goblin Wizard.  The going wasn't too tough.  Between Zak's pet and Tal's brute strength, we hit the spawn room in no time.  Now we just gotta wait for the pop.  We killed off everything in sight easily, they don't train up as much at the bottom with all the doors.  So, we were waiting around in the bar room for the spawn.  He spawned in the next room about 7 or 8 minutes later.  We took him out along with his 3 cronies and for the 5th time, the rat-bastard didn't drop my Heart of Fire!  UGH! <br> <br>Back to the bar room to wait for next spawn.  Only about 15 mins.  But those 15 mins can seem like forever.  People get a little antsy while waiting, and beating the snot out of green mobs in adjacent rooms is a fun way to relieve the bordem.  So Tal and Zak headed off, not far mind you, to have a bit of fun.  One room away, Tal ran into everyones worst nightmare.  She stumbled into a Reckless Efreeti with two Fire elementals.  She fought like a banshee, and then screamed like one as her hp's drained away.  By the time Ostapa and I got there, it was all over.  The problem with fighting in the bottom is that it's like a maze, none of us are very familliar with it, and there aint a zone line within 5 mins of SOW.  Then if ya do try and zone, you get the fun of running past every damned mob in the place so they can each extract their pound of flesh from you along the way, making retreat an almost non-existant option.  But more on that later. <br> <br>Continued in Episode II.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugordonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gordonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/31/02 9:27:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Episode II</span><hr size=1> EPISODE II: <br> <br>We dragged Tal's corpse into the bar room which is moderately safe, no more than 2 or 3 mobs will spawn there at a time.  Next the call went out for rez.  Ostapa found a young cleric at the enterence would do a 10% for us if we could get the corpse to the top.  But at L16, he'd never make it down here alive.  Noone's got a clue how to get back up except me, and at L30, I wouldn't make it up alive unless the whole (remaining) group went up too. <br> <br>Now I have a guilty conscience.  Do we stay and wait for another spawn or two and try to achieve our objective, or do we abandon the quest, make Tal whole again and get out with our tails between our legs.  God I hate those choices.  Tal was bound in LOIO and it would take her forever to get here.  Or I could gate back to LOIO, port her to NK, then have Ostapa meet us there and everyone head back to Sol A.  To make a long story short, we compromised.  Ostapa found this guy Cellic to drag Tal's corpse up to the little cleric for a rez.  Cellic was on his way down to us and me, Ostapa and Zak would wait for next spawn. <br> <br>Well, a whole bunch of ph;s spawned and we easily cleared them out.  Oh crap... Just got word from Cellic, he is dead and the trip down for the corpse is gonna take a while.  DOH!  I did a quick /who to find a L52 Vicar right in the dungeon with us!  Maybe Big Juju aint so pissed off at us after all.  After talking to Currin (the vicar) he agreed to rez Tal if we just get her corpse to the king room.  AWESOME!  No, wait a minute... where the hell is the king room?  O wonderful, it's at the exact other end of the dungeon and none of us know how to get there.  Oh crap, Ostapa just went LD.  This is getting better by the second!  And yes, Big Juju is MIGHTY pissed that we're trying to spoil his fun! <br> <br>Cellic to the rescue!  We were in a bar room, something like this one.  They served beer there, but not quite as good as this.  The door opened, and in strolls this dopey little elf, half dead, Cellic!  Now, noone knew quite what to make of him... but there he was, and in he walked. <br> <br>Cellic agreed to drag the corpse to the king room, awesome.  All that's left now is me and Zak.  &quot;How the hell did we go from 5 group members to 2&quot; I was wondering as we followed the little elf out.  Bah, no problem, we're good now.  so, we follow along.  Me and Zak kinda forgot about Ostapa, who went LD in the bar room.  oops.  Sorry man.  My bad.  We head up the stairs and I thought maybe I should go invis so I don't start a train?  Yeah, that's the ticket!  So I stop for a second, quick invis myself, and start upward again.  Now I got a decent idea of the layout of Sol A, but I got a little turned around.  I had lost the trail of Cellic and Zak now and was just hoping to get the hell out of there without loosing a level.  I had made it to just below the window room, I'm golden!  Two more sets of stairs and I can hear the zone to Lavastorm calling to me like Jaagermeister to an alcoholic! <br> <br>Oh shit, there's a flame goblin wizard in the window room.  They can see through invis.  Uh... there's 3 gobby's in the room with him.  This is not looking like a healthy situation.  Should I port out?  If I do, the closest I can get to Sol A is Nek forest and that's a long run to get back here.  Hey, I got SOW, I can run right past these dweebs and make it right out!  No Problem!  <br> <br>I gathered my courage just as I heard that Cellic had arrived at the cleric and Tal was about to get her rez.  Things are lookin good now.  Here we go.... <br> <br>I made a mad dash through the room, the Wiz took a pot-shot at me, my invis broke, the other gobbys decided it was ass kicking time and this cute little message appears at the bottom of my screen... what was it? <br> <br>&quot;You have just lost SOW, kiss you ass goodbye numbnutz!&quot;  or something to that effect. <br> <br>Keep riunning.  What the hell am I gonna do now?  I could stop and try to gate out.  But if I do that, with half the damned zone chasing my sorry butt I'd have that nice ariel view of my corpse and get to make the run from Nek anyway.  So I keep running.  I'm heading out.  I swear to god that I'll never set foot in Sol A again (or at least for a level or two) if Big Juju eases up and lets me make the zone.  Come on BABY!  As I run, not only am I getting hit, but I gather more and more followers, this is the proverbial train from hell.  I think I can make it, just past the swinging axe, up the last set of stairs, and out we go.   <br> <br>Now I'm not saying I have bad luck, but I accomplished a feat that I was not even aware was possible.  I didn't bother trying to time it so I would miss the swinging axe, at this point, what's the difference If I take another 5 or 10 points of damage.  So I blew right on through there, and I hit that FU****G axe dead on and bounced off it!  Right into the loving arms of every mob in the zone.  I challenge ANYONE to try and bounce off the swinging axe.  I probably couldn't do it again if I tried.   <br> <br>It's interesting how slow you begin to move when you red health bar is at the border of turning purple.  The game actually seemed to slow down.  I could see the smiling faces of gobby after gobby cheing through my flesh.  Then that ever-so vertiginous view of my corpse, as I return to my bind point. <br> <br>Hey, She got her REZ!  Great!  Now I just gotta grab my corpse and high tail it out of that godforsaken dungeon.  I mem my spells and make the port to Nek.  Of course, there aint a soul within 2 zones willing to lay a SOW on me for CR.  so I start running north to hit Lavastorm.  Ostapa sends me a tell... <br>He came back from LD to a room full of gobby's and instant death.  Wonderful.  So he's on his way back to try and grab his corpse too.  Interesting little tidbit, the wizzy spires in Nek are surrounded by undead.  But they never blink at me as I go past, they're too low level, and besides... &quot;They're all green to me!&quot;     Well, I didn't appreciate how much damage 9 skeletons could do to me until I was down to one bub of health.  Those 3 or 4 point damage shots really add up after a long run.  NP, I can just get them all together, throw a nice AoE at the schmucks, and go on my way.  Three fizzles and half a bar of health later, they were all dead. <br> <br>OK, now I'm lost in Nek Forest, with half a bub of health, one full bub of mama (nope, not enough to port somewhere safe) and my ass is begining to ache from the incredible fu****g it has taken over the past few hours.  Surely Verant will throw me a bone and let me find the damned zone to LS.   <br> <br>Now for the icing on the cake, I noticed the little connection thingy in the lower right of the screen turning yellow.  Bah, happens all the time, keep moving.  Now it's turning red.  OK, stop moving, maybe the bitstream will catch up.  Now I'm doing the count.  You know the count!  bit loss is 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80... yup, I'm gonna go LD...85, 90...here it comes... 95, 97...you sons of (enter explative here)... 100%!  Yippee!  &quot;You have been disc..... <br> <br>Oops, now for the best part, blue screen of death pops up saying my hard drive is full and I'll need to clean it and run defrag to make more room!  &quot;honeeeey....&quot; I yelled through the house.  &quot;Could you bring me my razor, I need to slit my wrists!&quot; <br> <br>What's the moral of this story?  Beats the heck outta me.  I guess there are some days when Big Juju, God of Verant decides to bend you over and treat you like his jailhouse cellmate.  This was one of those days.  Next time, I'm gonna recognize it at the begginning, log off, and go watch TV. <br> <br>My humble apologies, condolences, etc. to those who lost their lives in this epic struggle. <br> <br> <br>Gordonis<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugordonis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gordonis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/31/02 9:29:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Episode II</span><hr size=1> EPISODE II: <br> <br>We dragged Tal's corpse into the bar room which is moderately safe, no more than 2 or 3 mobs will spawn there at a time.
