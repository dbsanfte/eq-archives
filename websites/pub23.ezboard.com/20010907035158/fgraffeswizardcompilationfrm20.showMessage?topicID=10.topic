Just discovered these little buggers last night. They just beg to be quad-kited. I'm wondering if good olde CoF will work against them? <br>
<br>
Seems to take about 6+ conflags to take one down. So I don't even know if at lvl 45 if quading them is possible. <br>
<br>
Also, if quading how do you avoid aggro on the otters? <br>
<br>
ok.. lastly, I heard these guys drop gems frequently. I was told that most of them are quest items for Thurg/SS/Kael armors. Is there marketability in selling these to other PCs or just better to vendor sell them? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=cryhavok21>Cryhavok21</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/01 8:35:39 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wyverns of CS strats..</span><hr size=1>  Whoa dunno bout level 45 that would be lil tough imo, never tried though.<br>
<br>
 Gems 'can' be sold to pc's, but I'd hold on to em, you can use more than half and tough to sell heh.<br>
<br>
 The otters will not aggro if you attack em, they aint friends.<br>
<br>
 And once ya hit 49 get two chanters two more wizzies, and a druid/shammi.<br>
<br>
 Thats the best feel I ever had as a wiz. Three wizards standing in the center of 9 insta dead wyverns (enchanters could not seem to keep more than 9 mezzed for some reason, never played a chanter but I wish they could mez more, cause all 3 wizes casting snova we were able to make two pulls of 9 before medding.)<br>

 To be honest though qaud kiting em by yourself is better exp heh, not as impressive as aoe group though lol. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulordbug.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordBug</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/01 8:36:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wyverns of CS strats..</span><hr size=1> BoF seems to work fine against them.

That's the main complaint.<br>
<br>
I started quadding them at 52 with Pillar of Frost, and found that I just about had enough mana to do the job, and if there were too many resists, there could be trouble. However, if you get enough disatnce while they are BoF'd, they will warp back to their spawn; then you can med up a bit, and finish them off with a draught or two - just remember where you pulled from, and hope no one else steals them in the meanwhile (they also forget they are mad at you when they warp, you will not get xp if they are pulled and killed by someone else).<br>
<br>
It is best to pull to the beach. Up top, there is always a chance a drake will jump in, and they are very bad news once they start casting. I generally con a few to find blues (they start getting green at 52), then run by hitting them with Flux staff to pull. With lev up (it hurts otherwise <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), pull off the cliff to the beach, and run around a rock or something to group them up. Be careful first time, let them get close enough that you don't run headlong into them on your first turn. Then run along the edge of the cliff to get some distance, and BoF (or Atols) them all in one shot. I don't recommend BoF on singles to pull, you might run out of mana. Then just PoF (or PoL if you are as high as 54, probably the last level they will be worth it) as usual, running between for proper distance. I like to turn around before nuking, to make sure I don't catch an otter as tehy are running by - you do NOT want an otter camp on you.<br>
<br>
That's about it - it was rare with PoF that all would die at once, generally one or two would resist for half damage or less in the course of the hunt. I have never had PoL resisted at all.<br>
<br>
All that said, out of courtesy, I dont quad kite if there are a bunch of people hunting in the zone. Single pulls are not really that much slower xp gain - since quadding takes a full bar of mana or more, and singles only take a half or less, there is much less down-time with singles, esecially if you get a lot of resists quadding.<br>
<br>
Wyverns are not social, they won't help each other out as long as you stay far enough to not aggro the ones you aren't killing. Drakes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and will jump in if they get close enough to a wyvern you are killing. The only wyvern that is an exception is Yvolcarn, who is not only social, but often level 51 or higher, and will summon. He also gives a faction hit against CoV and Yelinak, which the unamed ones do not. Stay clear of the part of the beach near the tower - bulthar are very aggro, to everyone, and will kill you fast. Near the very tip of the peninsula are sirens, who you also want to avoid, unless you enjoy being charmed and ganged up on. <p><b>Daeanor Endarion of the Rathe</b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udamarkifrit.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Damark Ifrit</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/3/01 8:21:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wyverns of CS strats..</span><hr size=1> I am not sure what I am talking about, othmirs or otter, but I know one of these guy hate drake so much.

Also, those otter, othmirs whatever down the beach hate drake and wyverns, so u can just lev, and train the drake to their camp. I figure the drake wouldnt respawn until after 2-3 quad kites ( plus med time ).  <p><center>

<br>
If your going to pull drakes do an ooc so the &quot;tourists&quot;, professional or otherwise don't go wandering up to your mob and trigger that AoE. You just loose your kill to the Othmir. <br>
<br>
Other good news is that those rare hides they drop are worth serious plats to extremely high level tailors (220+ skill). Those hides make Wisdom items we could only but shudder to see in an Int type (AC 8 +8 Wis +mana +4 sv vs cold belts, etc.) but they are rarified drops.<br>
<br>
If theres a bunch of folks hunting Wyrens in CS be kind and share or you'll find yourself without any spawn in which to hunt at all. Watch for Yvolcarn (51-53rd level named Wyren) and Bluewhar (sp) the named drake (level unknown, may or may not summon but nearly soloable at 56 - always need just a tiny bit of help finishing him off).<br>
<br>
Theres a clump of three wyrens up on the back of the cliff that DO beg to be multikited BUT con each one. Yvolcarn can indeed pop in one of those spots as well, ruining your day and kite.<br>

i find it alot easier to single pull, than to bother with quad kiting unless im paired up with a druid, BoF just doesnt last long enough to handle the time it takes to gather 4 up, and use CoF to nuke them all down, with the occasional resist.<br>
wyverns have about 3k hps, 3 ice comets kill them everytime, but they seem to have high cold resist, so IC isnt the best choice. rend/conflag/draught is a better choice.<br>
they do drop quest gems quite often, and the ocasionall semi precious gem (emerald/opal/etc.)<br>
plus the pelts are used for tailor made shaman armor.<br>
i dont mess with the cobalt drakes, there just too tough to solo. ive seen them wipe out full groups of players that didnt know what they were getting into.<br>
<br>
sirens are a must to avoid unless your in a full group and prepared to handle them, ive seen them charm lvl 60 players with 100+ MR.<br>
<br>
wyverns are UBER xp for wizards or druids that can snarekite, other class's there not that great for, they hit for 110s, so melees cant solo them, and fear kiting isnt that great because pathing isnt the best, and a good chance youll aggro others that way.<br>

VERY fast xp there. It seemed safer to just pull singles at 53 as ice spells can be resisted a lot and if you must zone out and back in that is a lot of downtime created. Singles in the end may be faster xp than attempting quads with pillar of frost.<br>
<br>
A few notes on the zone.<br>
-Levitate is not required but VERY helpful, so snag a pegasus cloak like me (hehe) or stockup on bat wings. Levitate is used for pulling from the top-area where the Wyverns are, down off the cliff to the sandy beach where the otters are.<br>
<br>
-If you have Dub. or higher faction with CoV, there are only 2 CoV mobs that will assist the Wyverns, Cobalt Drakes and the named Wyvern (52nd lvl) named Ylvocarn (or something like that). Usually Ylvocarn is up at all times, just in a random spot that a Wyvern usually pops in. There are 3 Cobalt Drakes that wander from the NE part of the ledge to the dragon circle. Then 1 more that wanders from the dragon circle 1/2-way to the Skyshrine portal tower.<br>
<br>
-Cobalt Drakes proc a HUGE area effect 495 dmg spell that dispells 1 effect per proc. Procs every 10 sec or so as long as your in casting range. If this happens usually people will get uber pissed at you, but if you immediately run it down to the otters, its AoE will argo every otter down there basically and he'll get his butt kicked. (Middle otter camp works best, the otter &quot;king&quot; or whoever is there)<br>
<br>
-Yvolcarn summons, so if you argo him, well, i donno, scream?<br>
<br>
I killed a cobalt drake solo one time and it dropped Boon of the Garou, I was only level 54 but survived with 40hp, lol, needless to say no more drakes for me.<br>
<br>
After over a week of logging on, killing wyverns for 6+ hours, and logging off. I can tell you the loot off them, hehe.<br>
<br>
Wyverns drop the spell gems required for Melee legs, Melee sleeves, Priest Legs, Priest Sleeves, Caster Legs, Caster Sleeves. All other gem drops are useless and can be sold to vendor for 45p or so a pop. They drop hides, teeth, and the occasional Peridot. No spells though.<br>
<br>
Throughout my hunting there from 53-55 ive gathered at least 10 of each quest gem possible from the wyverns, most I gave to guildmates.<br>
<br>
Once you hit 54, you get Pillar of Lightning and it becomes massive experience, just use your flux staff and tag 4 blue wyverns (being careful to avoid Yvolcarn and Cobalt Drakes) run to the beach, play cowboy and round them up, snare them, and Pillar of Lightning until dead.<br>
<br>
To put their hp into &quot;bubble&quot; perspective, soloing a wyvern at 53 required about 2 bubbles of mana, and thus I could take 2 down in one mana charge and have 1 to spare as &quot;emergency&quot; mana for failed snares and resists.<br>
<br>
Quading at 54, it took about 3 bubbles to down all 4, making it much more efficient.<br>
<br>
This is a great zone but like they said earlier, it only takes 2 or 3 quading ppl to clear the wyverns.<br>
<br>
At 55 they are mostly green though *sniffle* and now I dont know where to hunt, CS rocked, especially since you could just port directly to your hunting ground, hehe. <p>-----<BR>

<br>
Even at 53, you can down a set of 4 of them with maybe 2 bubs left over...on a good pull.  What I found is that there is more then likely one straggler who resists better then the others and you'd have to use up the remaining mana to clean him up.  Not that efficient yet, but do-able.  <br>
<br>
Most irritating thing is for the occasional wyvern to teleport away from you when you have no mana to do him in...it's like giving away a free kill.<br>
<br>
Pulling anywhere up to 3 of them seemed way easier to handle...but that's not really &quot;quadding&quot; now is it?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Four at a time is a cinch with PoF and I have a full bubble of mana when done and usually Harvest if I time it right.  When drakes jump in I run them off, snare, and return to kiting and avoid the bugger. He warps away after a while.  I usually solo the single drake running between the portal and Skyshrine to clear the run-way...just keep him far enough away that he don't want to AE you and it's all good.  Good money, great exp, and I'm still waiting for my quest gems :P<br>
<br>
Good luck.<br>

Anyway, with conflag I can take these down in a perfect pull with 1 bub of mana left. On bad pulls I've had to resort to using a harvest for extra mana or a bunch of shocks of lightnings to finish them off, but the exp at this lvl is quite good- bout 1/4-1/2 blue bub a kill. As for gems, when I first starting fighting these mofos I got about 6 gems in rapid succession, but lately I have gotten none, so they're rarer than you're advertising them to be. And this zone is actually pretty popular on Karana where I am, usually a quad kiter can be found in the zone clearing all the spawns Im trying to get.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvespid.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vespid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/6/01 3:09:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wyverns of CS strats..</span><hr size=1> Check the link.. it just goes to file<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> / <p><img src="http://ns.iicanada.com/scott/pimp.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ureshionseora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Reshion Seora</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.shader.am/eq/icon.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/11/01 2:52:28 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://facelink.nbci.com/edit/raw/rawimage/64/1062864.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wyverns of CS strats..</span><hr size=1> they changed otters <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  they no longer agro drakes.<br>

<br>
Drakes can be taken out easily by a wizard of 50+<br>
<br>
Here's how (I'm gonna regret this I know):<br>
<br>
prerequisites:<br>
<br>
a. memmed: draught of fire, gate north(or wherever), BoF<br>
<br>
b. Some form of speed (sow or boots)<br>
<br>
creep up BEHIND them. Start casting BoF from OUTSIDE your casting range. Slowly move up and up till you do snare it.<br>
<br>
TURN AROUND AND RUN LIKE A BISH<br>
<br>
Once you're a bit away, keep slamming your draught of fire (all your spells are hotkeyed, right?)<br>
<br>
Nuke, turn and run 5-6 steps away, nuke again. Repeat till dead.<br>
<br>
The trick: Our casting range is significantly greater than that of the drake. What this means is that we can cast and have the spell go off before we trigger their AE.<br>
<br>
If they resist the snare, stay calm. Root it and gate. Come back to fight another day. Do NOT try and run to snare it again. Won't work, and most likely you'll get other people killed.<br>
<br>
I've killed dozens of drakes this way and never got touched once. <p>Zalbar The Mad
