There was a feeling of snow in the air, but I would not be able to stay to see it. Reaching into my pack, I withdrew a large leather bound book and studied a page for a moment, making sure I knew the exact pattern and rythm of the words. Replacing the book in my pack, I shouldered it and looked around one last time. <br><br>From my vabtage point high atop a lonely boulder, the Stonebrunt mountains gleemed silver in the soft moonlight. I could still hear the sounds of tent flaps creaking and fires sparking nearby, in the kobold camp I had been sent to keep watch on by my father, leader of the Crimson Hands. The kobolds had gotten a bit hostile, but had learned why one should not face a wizard's wrath.<br><br>Running my fingers through my hair, I checked the gift I had gotten on Mid Summers Eve from my friend Paksh, a gnome who we all called Packrat due to his tendency to collect bits of everything. He had called it a &quot;watch&quot;, and showed me how I could use it to tell time more accurately than I could using the moon or the sun. &quot;Five minutes,&quot; I murmured, &quot;time to go.&quot;<br><br>The darkness seemed to grow deeper as I started to recite the spell, a blue glow growing in front of me. When it was complete, I stepped into the swirling vortex, and immediately felt the pull as I had many times before. Lights danced before my eyes, but as quickly as it came, it vanished, and I found myself stepping gently onto the grass of Toxxulia Forest. Aorund me, four great spikes of rock pierced into the night sky. Breathing in the fresh night air, I walked over to where a man stood beneath the spires in a long silver robe.<br><br>&quot;Greetings, Elenar,&quot; I said as I walked up to him. &quot;Is it almost time?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;take this and wait inside the spires.&quot; He handed me a small glowing stone, and I knelt to meditate to make sure I was ready for the journey ahead.<br><br>It had been a shock when Al'Kabor, the seemingly independent and uppity ex-leader of the Magic guilds, arrived in a swirl or light into the very center of Erudin to announce that he had done it. It took us quite a while to discover that &quot;it&quot; was the successful journey to Luclin, the moon that crosses Norrath's skies every night. He told us of a ancient civilization living deep underground, and a race of huge cats, much like the lowly Kerrans only more advanced, and other wonders he had seen. Most of us disbelieved him, remembering times in the past when his discoveries had turned out to be complete fiascos. Even after we had proven his discovery, we were never sure he had really been the one to accomplish it. Eventually, we had accepted his offer to take one of us there to prove it, and my father accepted. Once he had seen the moon with his own eyes, he admitted that the story was true, and plans were made to set up a systems of transporation that allowed for commerce to and from our satellite. The most gifted young men at teleportation were drafted to be scions, guardians of the gate to the moon. One of these was Elenar, a friend of mine from my earliest childhood.<br><br>This last month had been a time of great surprises. I was promoted to full journeyman rank, and allowed the freedom to wander the face of Norrath in search of knowledge and perhaps the experience needed to become a Master Sorceror. the biggest surprise was when my father told me that I had been accepted to travel to the moon and help in his studies by researching the native magical flora and fauna. Only a select few wizards had been allowed to make the journey, and I was excited to finally see the wonders that had been described.<br><br>Finally, Elenar stood up and walked into the very center of the circle made by the spires. <br><br>&quot;Are you ready, Atelen?&quot; he asked me.<br><br>&quot;As ready as I'll ever be,&quot; I replied. &quot;Let's go to the moon.&quot;<br><br>a moment of silence descended, and then a faint hum could be discerned coming from the spires. A swirl of energiees coallescesed into a ring inside the spires, the magic churning and straining to escape. Blue fire, like liquid saphiire, engulfed the circle, as two brilliant silver orbs began to orbit around it. Faster and faster they went. I could feel the power, the energy of the flow, straining against the bonds that held it, gaining enough power to send me to the moon.<br><br>Suddenly, a shaft of brilliant cyan pierced the night sky. I could feel the torrent rush into the space suddenly opened, feel myself dissolving and running along with it, being pulled higher and higher into the sky. I was rushing through a howling tunnel of light and sound, onward and onward without hope or need of stopping. Then darkness...<br><br>The world started to shimmer back into being. I percieved a huge cavern, deep underground. A smaller replica of the spires I had just left rose up on all sides. for a moment I was afraid the spell had not worked. As my senses came back to me, however, all doubt was banished from my mind. I stood up, staring all about to take in the sight. Water dripped from teh cavern's roof, and a steady flow of people, from the moon and from Norrath, swirled in and out of four tunnels leading away from the chamber. A silver-robed figure detached from the shadows and walked towards me.<br><br>&quot;Welcome,&quot; she said, &quot;to the Nexus.&quot; <p><img src="http://web.tampabay.rr.com/eqsite/Atelen.jpg"><BR><table border="0" width="111"><tr><td nowrap style="filter:glow(color=#6633FF"strength="1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt'"><font Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif> "And so I close, realizing that perhaps the ending has not yet been Written." -Atrus </font></td></tr></table></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uatelen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Atelen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://64.3.126.108/webadmin/imagespages/panel127427.GIF" BORDER=0> at: 1/17/02 11:32:42 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usanlear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sanlear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/16/02 8:34:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.imagenetion7.hpg.ig.com.br/pahdme/ccabral/pages/ccc01.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luclin</span><hr size=1> Well done Atelen.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I don't think any of us will forget the first time we arrived at the Nexus (or any new zone for that matter).   <p><img src="http://web.tampabay.rr.com/eqsite/Sanlear.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uatelen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Atelen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://64.3.126.108/webadmin/imagespages/panel127427.GIF" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/16/02 9:05:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luclin</span><hr size=1> The part I didn't add was when I walked into Paludal caverns w/o invis and got eaten by bandits &gt;&lt; <p><img src="http://web.tampabay.rr.com/eqsite/Atelen.jpg"><BR><table border="0" width="111"><tr><td nowrap style="filter:glow(color=#6633FF"strength="1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt'"><font Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif> "And so I close, realizing that perhaps the ending has not yet been Written." -Atrus </font></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usanlear.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sanlear</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/16/02 9:21:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luclin</span><hr size=1> Hehe.

Even in my anger I watched my step as I crossed the great bridge, noting the long fall into the dark abyss.<br><br>&quot;May Ro burn them all!&quot; I seethed as I entered the gates back into the city proper. &quot;Won't help one of the 'lesser races' will they?&quot; The words of the head mage, an elderly man dressed in a blue robe, still burned in my mind. &quot;Train you, one of the lesser races?&quot; he had scoffed. &quot;Prove your worth and then we shall speak about training.&quot; <br><br>I clenched and unclenched the bit of parchment that listed the materials I would need to bring back to the guild leader to &quot;prove&quot; myself. As if I had not already proved my worth in the vast marble halls of the Erudin palace! I sighed, the littany already forming in my mind. I murmured the words slowly, bringing forth memories from long ago, when I was a boy studying under the watchful eye of my father. &quot;..tsahn bahrehl shorah. Mehr, tahgahm, tsahv.&quot; Find the road to peace. Watch, know, live. I felt my anger stream away like a burning wing across the desert. I sighed and stepped into the eternal night of Shadowhaven.<br><br>Hawkers yelled their wares on ever street corner. Guards in shining plate and mail marched the streets, keeping the peace. This was a job that had gotten considerably more difficult as of late, since the ways back up to the moon had opened once again. Over everything rang the hollow echoes that always reminded me that we were underground, miles beneath the rocky surface of the moon.<br><br>&quot;Wash were yoush goink!&quot; squealed an angry, hiccuping voice right beneath me. A beady eye stared out from beneath a pair of thick goggles, from which protruded the very red nose of a creature perhaps two and a half feet, maybe three, in height.<br><br>&quot;Pardon me, good sir gnome,&quot; I apologized. Normally I make it a point in cities to watch where I step, since the shorter races take great offence at being overlooked.<br><br>&quot;Welsch, wash sho bigsh feetshes necs dime.&quot; He hiccuped. I calmly guided him back towards the tavern he seemed to have come out of, trying to end this quickly so that I might be on my way.<br><br>&quot;How is the ale here, if I may ask with a twinkle in my eye.<br><br>&quot;Owsch, eesh bery goodch.&quot; he burbled. I motioned to the bar-tender that perhaps the fellow should end his drinking for the night, and moved off. The hustle and bustle of the city swirled about me, sweeping me off with the flow of the crowd. I kept my eyes everywhere, not only to take in as much as I could but to watch out for any signs of trouble. Other than a surly dwarf or two, I noticed nothing particularly out of the ordinary. It was almost a relief to be back in a true city once again. As beautiful as Erudin is, at times I prefer the continuous noise and activity of larger cities where all races mingle. not only that, but Shadow haven, or Fordel Midst as it used to be known, was much cleaner and ordered than some places I had been, notably Freeport, who's pigsty streets and corrupt militia had disgusted me.<br><br>I had almost reached the other side of the city, where several friends studying at the guild house had directed me to the entrance of Paludal Caverns, which lead to my next destination; Shar Vahl, crater city of the Vah Shir. I would have to watch my step, since the Vah Shir were anciently descended from the Kerrans, but were sent to the moon on the huge mass of earth that had been dug out to form the Hole and the heretic city of Paineel back on Odus. I stepped into a doorway and rewove the enlightning spell about my head which allowed me to see in this dark environment. I conjured a glowing orb and set it in the air beside me, taking out my pipe to have a last draught before entering the even closer darkness of the caverns. I had only just taken out my pipe when a hand, black as the darkness of the caves, grabbed my shoulder. Instantly summoning a storm of mana about me, ready to release it in a heart-beat, I whirled around and gasped......<br>                                          -To be Continued <p><img src="http://64.3.126.108/webadmin/imagespages/panel129620.jpg"><BR><table border="0" width="111"><tr><td nowrap style="filter:glow(color=#6633FF"strength="1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt'"><font Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif> "And so I close, realizing that perhaps the ending has not yet been Written." -Atrus </font></td></tr></table></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uatelen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Atelen</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://64.3.126.108/webadmin/imagespages/panel127427.GIF" BORDER=0> at: 1/31/02 2:01:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eaminwhitefalcon>Eamin Whitefalcon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>¡Viva la inquisición!</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/31/02 2:31:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luclin</span><hr size=1> THE HOUSE OF MIDST CALLED AN ERUDITE A LESSER RACE!<br><br>BURN SHADOW HAVEN TO THE GROUND!!!! <p><center><img src="http://web.tampabay.rr.com/eqsite/Eamin2.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uikeya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ikeya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<br>Ikeya != Chick</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/31/02 5:10:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Luclin</span><hr size=1> Been there done that.
