<br>
Hi, i've never met furor, but because foh keeps killing everything first and then makes comments like 'yep yep, our cack is the biggest' it's obvious he's an asshole...yeah...right....If you don't like it, don't go to their fucking page.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think most of the &quot;hate&quot; here stems from comments made by FoH members.  I also think it's clear that Furor is an asshole, but that doesn't particularly bother me because I won't ever have to deal with him.  <br>
<br>
Your contention that everyone who hates FoH must be a sore loser is obviously bogus.  I'll never be anywhere near a high-end guild.  Hell, my bard's still in partial lambent and my guild is only now almost done with HoT.  I don't care about ub4r l3wtz or serverwide firsts and I'd wager that many players feel the same way.<br>
<br>
FoH members have made one thing entirely clear, however: they want no changes that change the endgame.  That's succeeded in pissing a number of people off, particularly since Verant's developers do indeed seem to listen to them.  When discussing focus items and caster balancing in general, the most common reaction from people who've experienced the endgame is &quot;Wizards need no help.&quot;  When confronted with pre-60 wizards who feel underpowered in many situations, the response changes to &quot;Sorcerors need no help and levels before 60 don't really mean anything.&quot;  A few people claim situational weakness, ignoring the fact that a few simple changes would greatly improve the playing experience for people who HATE soloing but aren't really wanted in a group.  This is generally followed by an irrelevant argument over xp efficiency (not everyone cares about getting to 60 or leveling quickly).<br>
<br>
Now that focus items (I'm not arguing that they're an effective method of caster balancing) are out, the same people who felt that they needed no boost aren't interested in seeing said foci on the players who feel underpowered.  No, it has nothing to do with keeping the lowbies down, but it does serve to (again) piss people off.  Let me quickly remind you how this might look to a lower leveled caster: citing risk vs. reward, progression of equipment upgrades and the fact that wizards are balanced at 60, a relatively small group of players is saying that they should be the only ones getting the &quot;good&quot; focus items.  Understand why some people are annoyed?<br>
<br>
No, I'm not trying to start another argument over FIs.  I personally disagree with Verant's implementation and hope that something is done about it soon.  I'm just explaining how the thread started by Furor when mage summoned FIs were released might have served to annoy lower leveled wizards who feel underpowered.<br>

<br>
Life is full of irony if you're stupid.  Of course Verant's devs are going to listen to FoH suggestions when it comes to tuning loot and no one resents them for that.  As I said before, most don't care about the serverwide firsts either.  It's the attitude that only the endgame matters that annoys some people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=raistinfoh>Raistin FoH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/10/02 10:47:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1197.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> lmao</span><hr size=1>  I have no clue where you people get &quot; The kids play 60 hrs a week!1&quot; and other bullshit.

You're absolutely right.  No one (besides a significant other, perhaps) should give a damn about how much time another person spends playing EQ.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, who needs to think about it?  It's generally acknowledged that being in an &quot;uber&quot; guild requires a greater time commitment than a casual gamer is willing to make.  Are you really trying to claim that a MAJORITY of active FoH members play only 18 hrs/week?  I call bullshit on you!<br>

Actually, I've noticed that most of the people making remarks about FoH (on this messageboard at least) give their character name and server.  I'll discount the possibility that you're asking for RL info as you don't seem to be overly forthcoming on that score.<br>

And here we come to the crux of the post.  Obviously, everyone who has said anything against FoH or its members must have penis envy at 12.  Petty shit?  The only ones mentioning penis size and animal rape are FoH members and friends.  To me, that sort of rhetoric is infinitely more petty than anything said by Onail who was, after all, only going by the comments on your webpage:<br>

1st - As stated before i wasn't cursing, or even saying any bullshit about FoH. Re-read the post yourself with more attention next time, try to understand that this was a post about ADDICTION and how it affects EQ players. I won't repeat myself on why FoH was mentioned.<br>
<br>
2nd - As this isn't an Anti-FoH thread i assume that the hat fitted perfectly for you. By the tone of your post the thread really must have gotten deep on you.<br>
<br>
3rd - Actually i do work all day from 7:30 AM - 12:00 AM<br>
and then 1:30 PM - 5:30 PM, and after i get out of work i go to college from 7:00 PM - 10:30 PM, and only then at around 11:00 PM (if im not to sleepy) i play EQ until 1:00 AM or so and thats why  my necro who was created on february 2000 is still level 49. <br>
<br>
4th - Anyone willing to hit the reply button read this post carefully and see that there is not a single attack to FoH's. And to Raistin i only posted what i felt while reading his very flamed post.<br>

ps: I went to army for one year here in Brazil, actually all Brazilians that hit the age of 18 must attend to army and only the ones with phisycal problems or disease or bad stuff are dismissed from service.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uluxum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 10:15:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1197.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Bulls eye!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Anyone willing to hit the reply button read this post carefully and see that there is not a single attack to FoH's. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

No, this post was about an acidic Furor comment on the poor drop rate of Garrison's!  Just because some people with a chip on their shoulder over some players they've never even met hijacked the thread to make useless judgement calls on the relative value of those people they've never met's social lives, does not mean that is what the post was about.  Pay attention!  You want to talk about EQ addiction, hit that new thread button and don't use made up assumptions about players you don't know to prove your points. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uonail2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Onail2 </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 10:33:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1197.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Ok</span><hr size=1> I mentioned in a post on the other day that the post about him dieing swiflty blah blah was the only attack, sorry i forgot about it on my last post.<br>

Furor = Treatment Won't help. Thats my sarcastic opinion on someone that surely waste most of his time in EQ or doing stuff for the game. <br>
<br>
The post was about the spell dropping, i agree, but i am not sure if you noticed that the post was HIJACKED and now it is about ADDICTION..(hmmmm maybe it is about bitching now lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ). So as the post got moved to Rants forum and people changed subject it would be easier for you to start a new post about the spell dropping the bringing this one back to the first topic hehe.<br>

The whole problem here is that people like you are sitting here acting like you know how much Furor plays, whether he is an addict and needs help, blah blah blah, has no life, blah blah blah.  When in fact you don't know him or FoH and you sir are talking out of your ass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=raistinfoh>Raistin FoH</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(6/11/02 11:14:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1197.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok</span><hr size=1> Watch out.

His profile is very impressive and you bet i would like to have a character like his. The only problem is that i would have to give up on a lot of things in my life to dedicate to EQ...<br>
<br>
Well, give up on life or hope for EQ to be around in about 20 years from today <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Hello?  I said I agreed with your point, I just disagreed with the phrasing of your rebuttal.  Please avoid annoying rhetoric in the future.  In case you still don't know what I'm talking about, avoid references to animal rape and penis size; some people find them distasteful.<br>

Of course I don't claim to know how much you play.  Again, are you really claiming that the majority (you know, &gt;50%) of FoH members play only 18 hrs/week?

I think it is certainly presumptious of you at the very least to even have an opinion on someone you have never met's playtime and whether it is detrimental to their helth, based entirely on a magelo profile.  <br>

LOL.  I don't know why the fuck you care how much they play either.  In fact, that was the entire point of my posts.  Leave FoH alone, let them do their thing, get yer nose outta their business and stop trying to be an armchair psychologist for people you don't even know.  Just go out into your fabulous Brazilian real life weather and practice your friendliness a bit more.  Hopefully you will find a way to be less judgemental of strangers while you are practicing.  And the same goes for the rest of you who attack FoH with baseless, imaginary bullshit.<br>

(oh but wait, he has a real life, and is typing up a project in M$ Word, yes, yes, and alt tabbing to the messageboard of course).<br>
<br>
&quot;i'll believe you if you actually say foh plays blah blah per week&quot; <br>
<br>
And you think he needs to prove something to you, why? Wow...a-u-d-a-c-i-o-u-s... Seems to me like you're someone who claims he avoids the high end game of eq because it 'takes a lot of time' - maybe your guild takes 4 hours to get people together for a raid that takes 1 hour, but maybe his guild has its shit together and people can amass to raid in say, 1/90th the time your guild can.  Quit bringing up FoH playtimes, or 'uberguild playtimes' because it's a joke, I see a lot of ecwhores who think the game is about economy, and have 90+ days logged alone on their EC alts.
