1.) Just because verant is optimizing the game for one processor doesn't mean that anything negative is going to happen with other processors.<br>
<br>
2.) The reason they started this with the p4 rather than other processors is because -gasp- Umbra, the new visibility technology they use, is ALSO optimized for the p4.<br>
<br>
3.) there is no #3. muahhaha<br>

My main point was to basically paste your message with a few edits to show you how it can easily be turned around to favor the opposing point of view, while sounding just as good.

So, the K6 was a bit slow, but it's also very dated, and to talk about AMD performance and mention the performance of the K6 vs. the Pentium chips shows people who can't get their mind off the past.<br>
<br>
Since it's release, the Athlon has really changed the reputation of AMD when looking at performance, and if you remember back that far, it took the Athlon to force Intel to do a lot of upgrades to THEIR processors.  When it finally became obvious that the design of the Pentium Pro(which the P2 and P3 were modeled after) was finally the limitation to how fast the P3 chips could be clocked, they FINALLY pushed the P4's release, rather than waiting for their 64 bit processor line to be ready.  Now, the P4 has an all new design compared to their chips that came before it, and it's that new design that caused a LOT of misconceptions.<br>
<br>
The P4 has a high clock speed, as we all know, running up to 2GHz, but as many will point out, it performs MUCH slower in most programs because of the design differences.  It is those differences which force Intel to work with(and spend money on) various companies just to make those programs run at a decent rate on the new design.  It's really not about screwing AMD, but more that Intel is trying to make it so programs don't run poorly on the P4 the way they do currently.   AMD just happens to make their new chips run the existing programs faster with new chips without those modifications because they think of the users, and how well they will perform once it hits the market.  When AMD releases the hammer line of processors, they will again allow for existing programs to run faster without modification, but would perform MUCH better if programs were designed specifically to use their new features.<br>
<br>
So, that's it for the CPU battle, at this point, AMD has the advantage in real world performance, though loses ground against the P4 in programs that have been rebuilt for use on a P4.  The next is where many people get confused, chipsets.<br>
<br>
The chipset is what brings all your computer functions together, from the ISA/PCI/AGP slots, to USB to memory.  And it is the chipset that often causes the majority of problems for people, even though they don't realize it. <br>
<br>
In the market, on the P4 side, you have Intel and VIA, fighting as they have been for a long time.  Other companies such as SiS and ALi(Acer Labs) have also gotten into this area, but while both show up from time to time, neither has gained enough ground for long enough to be remembered by MOST people.  Obviously, Intel doesn't make chipsets that allow the use of AMD chips, so there is a split in most chipset companies, one set of chipsets for Intel, one set for AMD.  And to add to the confusion, most chipsets are divided into two parts, the northbridge, and the southbridge.  The northbridge includes passing of information to and from the CPU, as well as the AGP interface for our video cards.  The Southbridge includes the PCI and ISA slots, as well as memory.  Most on-board features on motherboards are connected through the PCI bus.<br>
<br>
So, if there's a problem with the video, the FIRST place to look is the northbridge if you are using an AGP video card.  For your northbridge, you MAY need to install a special driver for the AGP, possibly even for the chipset itself.  Most people don't realize it, but it's this need for a chipset and/or AGP driver which causes so many problems in EQ.<br>
<br>
There may also be an IRQ conflict being introduced through the southbridge.  I forgot to mention it is possible to have different brands of north and southbridge chipsets.  Many of you may have seen an AMD Northbridge, with a VIA southbridge.  This is done to get the best performance from the different areas of the system, and is also why it's possible to have different types of memory on different motherboard models even though the northbridge is the same.  VIA being a dominant player has an unfortunate history of having some problems which require drivers to resolve.<br>
<br>
Intel GENERALLY does a good job when they make a chipset, AMD chipsets are generally stable, though with a bit slower AGP performance.  VIA isn't always the fastest, or the most stable, and many times you NEED to update the drivers to get reliable or decent performance.<br>
<br>
So, before you say that Intel or AMD are better because Intel machines are more stable, remember that a VIA chipset MAY be at fault on your AMD based system.  Other things, such as power supplies, motherboard design, and video card design can also cause problems because of chipset incompatabilities. <br>

Due to Intel's reputation and marketing strategies they have captured a very significant portion of the home PC market.  If you were VI and had to decide which processesor to optimize your code for it only makes sense to optimize for the processor with larger installed user base.<br>
<br>
All this adds up to is better game performance for P4 users.  Yay for them.  I really doubt this code optimization will at all hinder players who use the AMD family of processors.  I'd go as far as to say that this will bring P4 users up to par with the performance of Athalon XP users.  I dont find anything wrong with that.<br>
<br>
When Luclin came out I upgraded from my P3 1000 to an AMD Athalon XP system and I've been very impressed with the performance.  EQ has never locked up and the system has been remarkably stable.  <br>
<br>
This is my current system:<br>

AMD Athalon XP 1800+<br>
Soyo SY-K7V DRAGON Plus<br>
512 MB DDR PC2100 RAM<br>
LeadTek GeForce 2Ti 200<br>
IBM Deskstar 45GB ATA/100<br>
Sound Blaster Live Value<br>
Windows XP Professional<br>
<br>
<br>
This system vastly outperforms my P3 and it was cheaper to build ! The only thing I need to do now is bust my bank and purchase a GeForce 3 Ti500 =) <p><p><div align="left">

The p4 IS a faster chip, in every sense of the word. The problem is that you can only tap into that performance with specialized code, which really makes the chip look worse than it really is. <p>Etnu Phyresoul, servicing Solusek Ro since March 2000.

It really comes down to what you want to run, that's all.  If this has any impact on the game it will be for the better.  Face it, a majority of the machines shipping these days have Intel inside. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

PS: I like Intel, they've always been good to me.  Yes, I tried AMD... didn't care for them or their customer support. <p><br>

But that is only if I had the mola for it.  But if not, I rather go for an AMD processor and a ASUS MB(Although it would run well with a Soyo MB), kick arse combo, and upgrade from there on.<br>

*nods* Yep, I run a few of my Windows-based Graphic programs on my Mac.  I've tried running EQ on there but it just run as well as my PC.  Why oh why couldn't there be a Mac version of EQ? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamdeathwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sam DeathWalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/1/02 7:59:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: intel</span><hr size=1> This is a ton of nonsense. Your only concerned about frame rates. Frame rates are MAINLY a function of the video card. Sure if you have a junk video card and let the processor do all the video then the &quot;optomized&quot; P4 might run faster than an atholon. But anyone with a Geforce2 or better will be frame rate limited by the speed of the Video Card not the processor. <br>
<br>
Athlon with Geforce 3 will have better EQ framerates than ANY pentium (2GHz 3Ghz etc.) with Geforce 2 no matter what they do to the code. <p><CENTER>Sam SoulBleeder DE Wiz 41th Season, 46
