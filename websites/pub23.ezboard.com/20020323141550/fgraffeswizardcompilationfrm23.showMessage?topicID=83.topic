Was a very lucky EQ day, got 2 sirens hairs in less then 10 kills and suceeded the thread combine and the shawl combine with 147 tailoring (int/dex at 255) - first attempt!. Dont hate me cause im lucky! =P <br><br>Anyway, I thought I would share my experience with the wizard community.<br><br>The easiest spot in CS I found to kill sirens is the entrance to SG.  If you have an EB item its really easy to camp them from the bottom of the lake. Med a little ways down the coast, invis up when youre ready to pull. Swim out and target the nearest siren. Backtrack a ways, far enough away that you dont see the sirens anymore but youre still in cast range. If you can see the sirens through the murky water youre too close and will get aggroed before your spell finishes casting. <br><br>I was killing enticers in 2 shots - open with sunstrike follow up with jiva = dead enticer. The seductresses need a couple more draughts but were still pretty easy. I could kill 3 enticers (possibly 4) on one bar of mana. I didnt bother with enchantresses as 1 - none spawned where i was camping, and 2 - theyre blue to me - less of a hassle killing the greenies.<br><br>As a wizard its pretty easy to camp the lower level sirens. Open with your biggest nuke then chaincast an interrupting nuke - ideally draught of jiva (if you have it). You could opt for shock of lightning, but that may make for a longish fight. Even though youre not doing as much damage its worth getting the cast interrupt - unless you want to take your chances with the charm. Low level skin shield is a good idea - theres no point wasting peridots on manaskin, steelskin was ample protection from their melee - manasink may also be a good idea if you have it.<br><br>good luck hope this helps! <p><font face="verdana" size="2">[60 Sorcerer] <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=85843" target="new"><b>Diomedes</b></a></font> (High Elf) <font face="verdana" size="2"><font face="verdana" size="2">&lt;The Vagrants&gt; ZONE:ezboard</font><br><b><font face="verdana" size="2">The Tribunal</font></b></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucabottp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>CabotTP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/29/01 12:22:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=83.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizards and Siren hunting</span><hr size=1> <br>Not being 60 I guess my version of this would be open with Ice Comet and then chain Jiva...

I've noticed no one mentioned there is a single siren spawn on a rock directly behind the 5 spawns below tower.  The cliff face is unclimable though so I guess you'd have to pull it into water or keep it rooted to hit it.  I went to the SG entrance and onl,y saw one siren swimming outside.  Is this normal or are the others dead or hidding somewhere?  Will attempt the single siren below tower today with IC, then Tishan's Discord, then draught of fire and see if that works.  BTW, does SOL interupt these things?  I know it interupts other players, but haven't seen it help much on NPCs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ucrazywizzy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crazy Wizzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(10/23/01 12:43:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=83.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Another Information</span><hr size=1> These gals were so much fun!  I went back a few weeks ago with some friends to kill them and get my hairs;  It was me, a 56 wizzy, a 52 bard, and a 87 rog with his epic.  We pulled the ones by the SG zone pretty easily.  I would invis, go down in the water, target one, come back into the tunnel still in nuke range, and would hit them with a debuff to pull them.  The first couple times, even with my MR well over 140, added to by the bards MR song, which put it close to 200, (if I remember right) I got charmed.  I killed both the rog and the bard so fast they did not know what hit them.  Then a level 60 mage friend who was soloing them at the tower, told me to load non damage spells in my first and last spell slot.  The next time I got charmed, all I did was mell my friends a bit with my sorcerers bowl, big deal, they never even felt it.<br><br>Any way, we did good and got 4 hairs in just a couple hours.  Mean while, my mage friend  was not having as much luck by the tower.  So later I went to help him with  his hairs.  It went very fast at first, due to his pet and both of us using fast cast damage.  Then, we had a bit of a problem with targets, and got two by mistake (it was my fault entirely)  The pet got charmed and killed me!  Bah, but we got him his hairs.<br><br>I think that the best place to get them was at the SG zone.  I also think we got more hairs in less time, and most of them that spawned were green, where as many at the tower were blue.  Maybe this was just the mix that day, I dont know.  They were fun and me and my guild mate friends had a lot of fun doing it, charms, and deaths and all.  <br><br>NOTE:  These two friends are the same two that helped me with Tanik on the 4th shawl, and unfortunaetly we found the KDS many times before we found Tanik, and they died horribly several times there.  But, in all, on both excursions, we had a ton of fun doing this.<br><br>Siene Stormwalker<br>56th Evoker of E Marr<br>Officer of Eternal Haven <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=83.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=83.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=83.topic&index=17><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm23.emailToFriend?topicID=83.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm23.threadControl?topicID=83.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=83.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=83.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm39">MOB Resistance Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Luclin Spell Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Luclin Faction Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Luclin Quest Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Luclin Item Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
