I am 55 now, and since dinged to 46 only been Hate raid twice with the frist one total wipeout; nothing else, not even the entry lvl fear raid. It is not I been busy, it is rather no other plane raids were ever set up. Isn't this we SGA banded together for, huh, officers? EQ fun won't really begin until you get post 50 and start doing raids to various zones/planes. And if leaders don't set up raids, what are we here for? If you have other noble answers such as to discipline member for cussing in guild chat or cheating thru ebay, please let me know. SGA and Amnesty are losing high lvl members, for various reasons of course. But more opportunity for raids with other guilds is most common and unspoken reasons. <br>
<br>
Enough said. Even though I never been Fear and never lead a  raid before, I think I will give it a try if no one else would do it. If every thing goes smooth, I plan to have raid to some place every weekend, preferrable Saturday, and me and every one else should do exp grinding or other stuff on weekdays. When you commit my raid, please make sure you be available at leaset 8 hrs.<br>
<br>
Please indicate your interest in participating a Fear raid on Saturday July 14, with start time scheduled 5am pst. This may be a bit early for pst members, but just to accommodate other time zones and make sure we get the camp before someone else. If not enought time to prep to get it going on July 14, can be pushed further to 21. If Fear taken, will go to alt place such as Velk Lab or Hole or Chardok, Kedge Keeps, etc. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulandyalexandre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LandyAlexandre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/6/01 6:19:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fear Raid</span><hr size=1> Wow!  thanks for taking the initiative to get something started Milven.  I am really glad to hear it and im sure many others in our member guilds will be too.  Unfortunately, i will not be around on the 14th as i am going to a wedding that day (yes a RL one... i do still visit RL sometimes... hehe).  <br>
<br>
I would like to mention though that there are plenty of other reasons to join a guild than to go on raids.  While it is possible that the number one reason why people join an &quot;uber guild&quot; is to do raids (i mean really, is there any other reason to tolerate the spam caused by having so many guildies online at one time?), the smaller member guilds of our alliance have a lot more to offer.  <br>
<br>
The reason i love being a spirit guardian is that we are a close-knit group of friends who bring a feeling of family to the game.  Others would cite such great benefits to being in a guild like facilitating group forming, joining together to have a wealth of information to share and receive, or simply because it is a lot of fun to &quot;hang out&quot; with people you respect and enjoy chatting with.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, i know you and i dont share the same view on the game, and that's part of the variety that makes life spicy... if ya get what i mean...  i know i could be decidedly in the minority, but i thought i would add my opinion.  <br>

    Raiding was a part of why the SGA was formed.  The lack of people willing to step forward on a regular basis is the amount of crap they kept having to put with on a regular basis because person xx didn't get any loot or xp.  The high level raids are actually fun to do provided ppl go to have fun and not get bent out shape of if they don't get xp, loot, or things done how they think they should be done.  The Hole raid I ran last weekend went very smooth, kudos to all who participated.  People were patient during the cr we had to do but we got back in there and got some great pieces of loot.  Layout what ppl should expect so there is less room for complaining.  (btw, congratulations on 55!!)<br>
<br>
For those who feel as Milven do keep in mind that when you  whine about your raid leaders, it steadily it burns them out. After a while people will be less willing to run these raids.  Occasionally mistakes will be made, we are human, and are very sorry for it.  Running a large scale raid is quite challenging and the Kael raid has to be one of the hardest we manage.  Respect the whoever is running the raid. Pay attention. Be on time. Come to have fun and for a slim shot at loot. Don't expect xp. If you can't adhere to these simple rules please don't come because you will ruin it for the rest of the people.  We have the forces in the SGA to run many raids.  Now we need a few new ppl who are great at organizing to put some together.  <br>

Thanks for biting the bullet and setting up a raid. Since this is your first planes raid maybe you will take some advice from me. To do Fear successfully, you need several things; 3 chanters, 4 clerics, and a good pull team. The best thing for you to do at this point is make sure you have the above by sending them all direct tells and getting them to commit to the raid. You can then post that you have all these neccessary elements for the raid and more people are likely to then sign up for the raid.<br>
<br>
This is a list of people I think would be good to commit to helping on this raid. Obviously there are others that would also be good, but this are ones I have personal experience with.<br>
Myriah 56 chanter (got me already)<br>
Niema 55 or 56 chanter (best chanter for the buck)<br>
Srytic(sp?) 53? chanter<br>
Meann 58 chanter (not SGA)<br>
Heallann 55? cleric (same player as Meann)<br>
Landy 52 cleric (raid experienced)<br>
Elina 54? cleric (great cleric)<br>
More clerics just cant think of names right now<br>
Tekkang 55 Wizard (knows how to run Fear raids)<br>
Hareq 58? Pally (Mucho Experienco, but not in SGA)<br>
Zenknight 55? warrior (Good raid leader)<br>
Henklin 57? Ranger (Best puller of Fear I ever saw, not in SGA)<br>
<br>
You also need to know how to break fear. The suicide run and north camp technique is the best. If you dont know what I am talking about, post it and I will explain.<br>
<br>
Well good luck!<br>

Granted SGA is not responsible for setting up raid for us. But if not raising up a force to raid or go to places regularly, I don't see what else SGA is allied up for. Besides, this is the only way members can do thing toghther. And if any guild/alliance does not provide this function, sooner or later, people will leave for better guild so they can go places. <br>
<br>
There won't be Fear raid this Saturday. First I am not sure, there will be enough palyers to form a formidable force. Sencond, Modonli is putting up weekly dynamic raid Sunday. I will be happy to participate her weekly raid. So there is no need to set up separate event on weekend. <br>
<br>
I went to Fear with Modonli last Sunday. Due to lack of experience, we got a wipeout and CR lasted 14 hrs. Fortunately, I only had one corpse expired; as I know most members had more than 1 expired and Lingling lost 2.5 yellow lvl 56 exp bbls due to 7 deaths. But I had fun and I know next time it will get better.<br>
<br>
I applause Modonli's dedication to put up weekly dynamic raid for SGA. I hope everyone give her support by showing up and don't let this event died. And for those who left so you can go places, if you can read this, please just don't forgot to offer to take us to the new places that you have gone with your new guild.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umyriahwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Myriahwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(7/14/01 4:23:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=144.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fear Raid</span><hr size=1> Guess I missed this last comment, as I was the only one to show up for the saturday july 14th Fear raid at 8am EDT.
