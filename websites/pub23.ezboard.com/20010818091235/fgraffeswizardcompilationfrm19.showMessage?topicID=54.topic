This is what I did.   <br>
<br>
At Level 48 or so, I began my kiting career in TimDeep.   Spent most of my time, single kiting the different Spirocs that are on Spiroc Island.   When it was too busy there, I would go to BW and kite mobs there.<br>
<br>
Once I hit 51, I began to start Quad Kiting Fulltime.   I never really Quad before that, because I was unsure of myself.    But I soon became a Quad-kiting fool!  I began trying to selectively target Spiroc Provens in TimDeep.   At 51 also, I decided to leave TimDeep because all the Provens were become rare since there were a lot of kiters there.   <br>
<br>
I made my way to Everfrost and kited the Ice Giants there.  It was rather safe, and you make a ton of PP.   It is good to be able to leave your computer for a couple of minutes to do other things while you med up.   There is not too many trains there, so I think it is rather safe.   Some of the IceGiants began turning green but they still gave you EXP up to level 54.<br>
<br>
When I stopped getting exp form IceGiants, I made my way back to TimDeep, and called the Raptor Isles my new home.   I did not like using periots, so I stocked up on Jaspers for a DamageSkin, and a lot of Batwings.  I quad-kited there to about level 57-58.   By that time, some of the rapts were turning green, and not giving exp so I decided to find a new home.<br>
<br>
58 - 60, I spend in LFAY, doing Brownies Guards.   I mean it was unreal.  You did not have to worry about trains once again, and you could do other things while you med up.   Some people had problems there before, but once you use the right spells, you reduce their ability to hit you and heal themselves.   (Draught of Jiva - minor stun and interrupts Brownie Guards castings.)   58 to me when pretty fast, but that was just me.   It was down right pain to 59 there, because I think I was doing a blue bubble every 2 to 3 hours.  I did manage to pull it off, because I rather stay there then try to attempt a Sebilis group.   I personally think Sebilis is a pain in the arshe to find a camp.    Once I heard the last Ding, it went rather quickly at the brownies.  I would get about a blue bubble ever hour or so.    Maxed out my exp and still go there off and no to max out my exp if I die doing guild raids.    <br>
<br>
During the last 5 levels or so, I did try to do some groups but like I said before, it was a pain in the arshe for me to find a group.   I had done Chardok, and Sebilis but for me, it just did not seam to go that fast.   I will also offer you another place to get rather quick exp  with a lot of blue mobs around for people starting up a group.   I have several friends  who are a monk and shaman.  They ventured into Permafost, and made the pit there their new home.   The experience there is awesome, there was a lot to pull from.  Only thing bad about the place is that the lewt sucks.   Its kind of like the raptors but you know when you do raptors you are not expecting lewt. <br>
<br>
I hope this helps some.   If any has any questions or comments, I would be happy to help answer them.  :-)  Take care my fellow wizards.<br>

I have trouble finding uncamped locations to quad kite so I'd love to find something that had decent xp single kites.<br>

The exp with the ICE Giants was OK.   But honestly, for me, it was not a race too get good exp there for me.   When I picked the ICE Giants, I picked that spot for several reasons.<br>
<br>
1.  It is a relativly quiet zone.   You dont have to worry about people training you.<br>
2.  You had a time out period, where you can do other things  around your house while you med.   (For me, I would work on homework, do chours around the house, or talk to people on my other comuter.)<br>
3.  The experience was constant.   You get exp on every kill, even some of the greens have you experience until you were level 54.  <br>
4.  Another added benefit of the ICE Giants, you can make alot of Coinage.   I would be making 3 to 4K a day over the camping the ICE Giants.     Would give some of the fine weapons and stuff to the newbies that wanted them, or give the weapons and coins a  mule to hold for you.   Sometimes the gold got heavy but you can always find a newbie who will do banking duties for you at a small profit for them.   I had a mule one time that could not freaken move, because he was so encumbered.    He had  a str of 69 and weight of 325.   Good thing I did not have to run with him. hehehhehhe.      <br>
<br>
SO I would not worry about the time at the ice giants.    Because with all the money you begin to accumulate you can begin to buy your other hard to get spells, or equipment that you always have wanted to get.<br>
<br>
<br>
And to answers someone elses question, it is very hard to find places that are not camped now-a-days.    IceGiants, Raptors, and Brownies are now camped heavily on TM, but you just have to be patient.   It will all pay off for you.   :-)    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utinyzapper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tinyzapper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/9/01 5:11:43 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Path To Leveling To 60 from 50.</span><hr size=1> Can a 51 wizzie quad kite a ice giants in front of perma frost reliably? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udrinianshadowmere.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drinian Shadowmere</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/9/01 6:32:08 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/jeffmikos/newdrin1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Path To Leveling To 60 from 50.</span><hr size=1> A regular group in Howling Stones or even doing an AoE group in Karnor's basement will get you through lvl 58-60 faster than soloing any day.

Just find some people that play the same time as you and start a regular group at the same place.<br>

I think this for a couple of reasons.   First your AoE is Pillars of Frost, and I dont think they will have much of an effect on the ICEGIANTS.   I tried to do some Ice Base spells on them before, and either got resisted or not hitting for hardly any damage.   The second reason is that there are only three Ice Giants in Everfrost, and it is heavly camped.  I doubt you will be able to get three spawns all to your self.<br>
<br>
Some of the other post here are correct, I believe.   You can probably get more exp faster in groups, but for me I chose to Solo all the way up.    I found it was always hard to find groups before, so I pretty much liked my own personal playing style.   <br>

<br>
Nope.<br>
<br>
Couple reasons.<br>
<br>
1. Only 3 Ice Giants, so you can't quad them.<br>
<br>
2. I do these at 60 (for the quick cash influx) and with around 3K mana I still sometimes have to kill the last one with my robe when I take em all. They have lots of hp. When I did it at 59 I occasionally got xp of off one too.<br>

However, you should be able to do them singly at 51 if you can find them open. <p>Qaman<BR>

It may come close the first couple times, until you get use to them.     I would not recomend trying to kite both of them at the same time.    Here is why I think it would be a bad idea.    <br>
<br>
You snare them both, begin to AoE them.   You manage to get in one or two shots, while they are grouped.   Then one of them stops to heal themselves, the other continues to follow you.     They are no longer packed close  together and you probably will look control of the situation.   So with them being healers, there is no way to predict when they are going to heal themselfs.     Besides, if you kill 2 at once, then you have a long wait for the next sets of spawns.    I kill on and the other other.   I beak them apart, and makes is seam to go a little faster for me.    Instead of waiting 17 minutes or so for a spawn, every time I med up to full, one would be spawning shortly there after.<br>

It is not that bad anymore.     The bigest thing to do is to find out if it is camp.  If not, you are home free.   If it is not free, ask them to get on the list and to let you know when they are done, so you can take thier place.     I find it has always worked good for me there.      The druids and wizards that kite there, day after day, normally become friends with each other, and will more often let you know when they are done, so you can resume where they left off.    <br>

I did BW some, but I did not like it that much too before.    I just tried to experiment with it.   Running around trying to find mobs was a pain, and I found it was not worth it.     <br>

The rapts are the best place that I know where to go, if you want to solo your way through.   However, if you cant find that,  and you have to result in grouping:   some good ones that were listed are:   Vox's Pit, Sebilis, HS, and The Hole.    (I personally hated Sebilis.)<br>

There is a lot to pickup there at that level in the part on the flats before the Giant fort. Skeletons, Apes/Gorilla's and Hornets all run at the same speed and can easily be grouped. All you need is mana, jboots/sow and a temp flux staff. Go out, grab 4 with the staff, group em up, snare em and pillar em. Stay away from wurms, gullerbacks, and sarnaks (and giants, they don't kite as well unless you only do them). Where the terrain flattens out coming from DL, next to the road, is fairly safe. Nothing really spawns or paths by there. The clearing right there is usually pretty empty too. <p>Qaman<BR>
