<br>
&quot;I am not an officer of Amnesty nor a representative of the Saryrn Guild Alliance, the following statements are and editorial by msyelf and are not official statements from either organizations.&quot;<br>
<br>
Recently, I was approached by a player who had grouped with Amnesty and SGA members in Icewell.  This individual said that everything was going along great, and then a Druid Spell dropped.  He asked if he could roll on this item, and was told that &quot;This was a guild raid&quot; and that &quot;it was guild property&quot;.  If this behavior wasn't bad enough, when an SGA cleric showed up, the druid was shown the door.  Told that he would have to leave the group to allow the cleric to join.  This individual couldn't remember any of the names specifically, otherwise I would be tearing these individuals apart verbally.<br>
<br>
I was appalled when I heard this.  This is exactly why I have pursued the SGA and done everything that I have to promote it.  I was sick and tired of the big guilds inviting people when they needed them and not letting them roll on loot.  Kicking them out of groups when another one of their members showed up.<br>
<br>
What happened to the ideals of the smaller guilds and such getting together to help others.  Do you all not remember what it was like when the bigger guilds treated us this way ?<br>
<br>
Another thing that has bothered me has been the cookie cutter response letters that other guilds have gotten when they have applied to join the SGA.  As far as I can discertain, nothing has been done to get these people into the SGA.<br>
<br>
Another thing that has bothered me as been the elitist attitude that I have seen.  People stating that they want an all SGA only raid.  Is this what we want ?  Again, do you not remember the feeling when other guilds like TWC and OOP and such told you that you could not attend their raids.  Wasn't this why the SGA was founded so we could do things.  And that other people would not be excluded no matter what guild they are in or if they were in a guild at all ?<br>
<br>
Some one please tell me if this is the path that the SGA is going to take, I would like to know.<br>

And, for the most part, I think we've done a fair amount to keep things this way, though we may not have been perfect.<br>
<br>
I'm not disagreeing with you, as I've noticed some of the same tendancies, but I'd like to put forth a couple of reasons why things might be a little more &quot;elitist&quot; right now...<br>
<br>
Training process - From discussion I've seen in the past, a majority of the reason why people have been suggesting SGA only events is for the training. One prevailing attitude is that we need to work together well, and become a cohesive team before we offer our services to everyone else. I believe the idea is that we won't do anyone else much good until we can get our own act together.<br>
<br>
Logistics - Since up until relatively recently, there's been no solid management of things, we really havn't had a decent way of getting organized on our own, nevermind for the non-SGA folks. <br>
<br>
With that said...<br>
<br>
Now that things are solidifying, IMO it's time that we make sure that we set down some good habits and make sure we don't fall into the UberGuild realm. <br>
<br>
Perhaps we should start bringing in folks from other guilds, or advertising our bigger raids on the Saryrn board...I'm not sure. But I think Hareq's pointed out a dangerous trend that's started that, if we're not careful, might turn into something we really would rather not have around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uzalliben.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zalliben</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/16/01 9:29:47 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: State of the Union address</span><hr size=1> Bam Bam is the official mouthpiece so I'll let his words be the official responce.

<br>
The ONLY times someone should not roll on a piece of gear they can use is a) a person has geared the  raid towards getting that particualar item or b) they already have the item (or something better).<br>
<br>
The ONLY times someone should get the boot from a group is a) their conduct is poor or b) they are told from the begining that they are holding a spot for an enroute friend. Even then that is questionable.<br>

So long as the inviduals who join on any raids agree to need before greed philosphy, looting rights is a mute point. Surely some of the ppl who read this board know who was at fault so they have the opportunity to explain any reasons behind the actions. Every story has two sides.  This does not sound like any of the upper lvls I have grouped with thus far in the SGA and I am very curious as to who has adopted such an attitude.<br>
<br>
While there are many SGA only groups it is more out of new friendships forming than attempts to block out non-SGA comrades. IMHO.<br>

<br>
Now as far as the SGA only raids go. If I do a gear camp like GEBS your damn right it's SGA only. I do not feel the need to waste my time and all the others on the gear camp to outfit some guy who happened to be sitting at the zone wanting to go. Who's guild would not reciprocate in kind. If the turn out is good from our casters then so be it. Icewell has been different and I have worked hand in hand with other guild such as Isengard and Familjen to supply all who needed with armor and spells.<br>
<br>
The planes. Hate was a good example of this. We post weeks in advance to go and we get 1 SGA cleric, 1 FD puller and no rouges. We invited 2 extra clerics to go with us that were non SGA. The moment it got ugly one of the clerics (non SGA) threatened to leave before the CR was done. I personally would rather have people with me in key postions that have a vested interest in us getting out of a sticky stiuation then bailing cause they don't like something.<br>
<br>
Now I understand you points Hareq, Krytog and Zalliben. Consider this, it's all well and good to take friends along with us on raids, it's another thing entirely to take a horde of people that just decided they want a shot at loot and don't know how to raid into fear causing us heartache. A few friends is fine but how do you determine who is their for loot only and won't cause problems? Where is the cut off point as to who get's loot from an SGA raid. Do we take 20 extra people 10 extra? Is it fair to the members of the SGA to have to roll with 5 other Rangers who just showed up that day and won't be back after they get what they want?<br>
<br>
I don't see the SGA as a means to let the hordes of Norrath into large encounters. We go to the planes and gear camps to outfit our members not every Joe Blow that decides hey this is my shot at uber loot. Do we take friends sure we know them, group with them and trust them. Do we take everyone that wants to go, Hell no, if another small guild wants to go to the planes regularly with us then JOIN THE SGA!!!<br>

<br>
There are several guild wanting to join the SGA currently that help out on some of the raids.  Some of them will probably join us just as soon was we get all the detail ironed out and start adding additional guilds.<br>
<br>
I do find it strange that they are starting to have icewell raids without you since you finally have all but given up in frustration...  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Ask of the Spirits and the way will be shown...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uzenknight.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zenknight</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/16/01 12:10:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: State of the Union address</span><hr size=1> Actually I do remeber this incident the more I think about it. The spell in question was a cleric spell and this raid in Icewell was mine. Cicotte, Lingling, Zombei and a few others were there. This person wanted to roll on all the spells. He was interested in cash loot not his (druid) spell drops. I informed him that if he didn't need the spell (which he did not) that the spells were being donated back to the guilds there.<br>
<br>
He left of his own accord with the comment well then you don't need me. He was not kicked out by a cleric, in fact his leaving made Ling's life alot harder and she had to try and heal both groups and died in the process. He had replaced Mennian who had to log. <br>
<br>
So for the record the druid is full of @#%$!<br>
<br>
No one asked this knuckle head to leave so that he could be replaced by a cleric.<br>
<br>
The drop in question was a cleric spell Celestial Healing.<br>
<br>
Once he realized that cash loot was not an option he bailed.<br>
<br>
If you doubt the story then by all means ask the others.<br>
<br>
So next time you get a story like this from some loot hungry player out for himself please take the time to ask us first before you post a glowing indictment. It's obvious who was in Icewell and I think you know us a little better then that.<br>

If other people are invited into your group/raid, then they are entitled to roll on loot.  This just seems like common sense.<br>

Unfortunately, there are ppl who play only to get loot and as we identify them they may or may not be on the top of the list of ppl to invite when we are looking for people.

The story as told in the first post is blatantly incorrect. <br>
<br>
No DRUID spell dropped that this friend of Hareq's was not allowed to roll on.<br>
<br>
He was NOT asked to leave so a SGA cleric could replace him.<br>
In fact he replaced the only SGA cleric that showed that night.<br>
<br>
He left when he found out that we were not rolling on cash loot and was quite flip about being only there for loot.<br>
<br>
Now if any of you want to debate those points fine but frankly I really don't care what the common sense thing to do 3 weeks ago was. Those were the loot rules at that time on that raid and have sense changed. If you don't like that sorry you weren't there. The raid was an all SGA raid until Mennian left and we did agree to the loot rules by virtue of my posts to have the raid on this board. <br>
<br>
I tell you though defending this subject by saying well the loot rules should have been different in hind sight is pretty dam weak. The guy said we screwed him and dumped him not that he objected to the loot rules and left which is what happened.<br>
<br>
This is not the Blast Furnace but it's starting to look like it.<br>
<br>
If you guys have such an issue with this fine then count me out, cause quite frankly my integretiy in life and in this game have never been in question because I make sure not to step on people and to be ethical.<br>

<br>
I am dont normally speak out against others unless I see a obivious wrong in the works. I was present on this Icewell raid with Zenknight. I remember it well cause it was the first time I had ever been on a high end raid and I got summoned by one of the ice midgets. Anyway Zenknight is completely right in his statement &quot;No Druid spells dropped that night&quot;. We did however get a Celestial Healing spell, a couple of mage spells and one wizzie spell. And since noone at the raid could use the cleric spell it went to one of the SGA guilds for a cleric that could use it. At the point when the spell dropped our cleric had left and the druid had only just joined us a pull or so before it dropped. After the spell dropped and we didnt roll on it, since no one present could use it, He did disband and as i recall that was one of the last pulls as it left us with just Lingling as the healer. This resulted in about 3 or 4 deaths(one of which was Lingling). The raid then ended as the suriving hand full of us worked to get the folks an Exp Rez.<br>

I haven't been on any of the higher end raids. The things I type are not necessarily the opinions of my guild, the Proclaimers of Justice.<br>
<br>
    There is only one point I want to make here and that is this.  We don't need to bite each others heads off (figuratively speaking that is), we are supposed to be a group of people trying to work together... Zenkight no one said you did anything. It seems to me that Hareq is relating a story with the information he was given by another side.  Of course people in the SGA are going to have disagreements on things but we don't need to make the boards look like the blast furnace.<br>
<br>
    So all and all here's the question to ask yourself:<br>
<br>
DO MEMBERS OF THE SGA REALLY NEED TO FLAME EACH OTHER?<br>
<br>
Frankly this has made me rather concerned about the integrety of the SGA.  If some of the people want to turn this into a thing to curse back and forth at each other for then it is my feeling that they should just go flame somewhere OUTSIDE of the SGA<br>

<br>
Second; we need to give the raid leader the benefit of the doubt. It is a very hard job to do. Sometimes it is not obvious why the raid leader is doing something, and we better be well informed before we blast him for his decisions. (Obviously I am at fault for doing this before, sorry)<br>
<br>
Third; I am a little concerned about the attitude &quot;SGA only.&quot; For instant on planes raids I think we should allow friends to attend, but that friend should have a sponsor who will be held responsible for their friends behavior. One person can kill everyone on a planes raid; so we need to be picky about who joins the raids. We also need some sort of rule about joining in the middle of a raid. Purely equipment raids like the GEBs raid are different. Everyone in such a raid should know and be reminded that the raid is to get an SGA member a certain item or items. Most high level people are aware of such things, but reminders help prevent hard feelings.<br>
<br>
Fourth; the raid leader cant do everything. It think we all should make sure the group we are in knows what is going on. For instance, after the raid leader explains how we are attacking hate, someone in out group should say; &quot;so we all camo up, zone in when BEN says GO, and then run straight in until we see fire wall and then head to the zone wall just to the left of the fire wall?&quot;  &quot; and if we get attacked we run a little to the left and die?&quot; (or whatever the instructions were) Then make sure our group members all respond; yes! I believe it is the responsibility of everyone in a group to make sure their group knows what is up.  So we if move, everyone in the group should be saying; &quot;were moving guys, follow Hareq to the east.&quot;  And when someone new joins a group make sure they know the loot rules. In the case that started this thread I think the members of the raid let Zenknight down a bit by not explaining the loot rules to tht druid; although I guess from what Cicotte said there was not really much time to explain.<br>

Which means, NOT just everyone who felt like showing up that so and so day can join us, provided that we are not lacking the key classes(Cleric, chanter) of course.  I don't see why SGA has to host a so called &quot;completely open raid&quot;.  It's a ridiculous notion.  Since when did any raid composed of 40+ people organized?  Since when did any raid composed of 40+ people considered fair?  <br>
<br>
Has people forgotten that certain PoF raid when people started to show up 4 hours into the raid just for loot and when Arch FDed and ninjaed that Umbral BP while everyone else went down fighting?  Loot, like it or not, is an aspect of the game.  How many SGA members you know will show up raid after raid if non-SGA members keep getting lucky and winning all the good items?  Hypothetically speaking, if you have 20 SGA member and 10 non-SGA members present at a raid, and the 10 non-SGA members end up winning 3/4 of the loot due to lucky rolls, how is that considered to be &quot;taking care of our own&quot;?  <br>
<br>
Yeah I know some of you may think that I'm getting close to the &quot;uber guild mentality&quot; but you know what, these are all perfectly valid points.  SGA, like any other guild entity, should exist to benefit its member.  Diplomacy and good relations with others is important but it shouldn't come at the expense of SGA members.  While &quot;SGA only raids&quot; may not be the thing for us to do, &quot;invite only raids&quot; should be.  After all, we have been, and always will invite those players who are friends of SGA to the raids.  <br>
<br>
One last item.  Everyone who have been to their share of large raids should know by now that &quot;open raids&quot; are;<br>
<br>
1. A good deal of the time, they are unorganized and end in disaster.<br>
2. Shady characters tend to show up and end up ruining the experience for others.<br>
3. Too many chiefs, not enough indians.<br>
4. Loot rules are rarely *acceptable* to everyone participating and of course, lots of complaints.<br>
<br>
These are the perfect arguements why NOT to have completely open raids. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utelivaksk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TelivakSK</A> at: 4/17/01 7:47:18 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uholtthecleric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Holt the Cleric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/17/01 9:23:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Large scale raids</span><hr size=1> After reading all these post I am getting quite worried about the stability of our Alliances. It is seeming that we are no longer friends grouping to achieve a common goal, but instead we are reaching the mentality of the uber guilds. I personally will not be a part of such a thing. I have played this game since beta and have seen SO many guilds disolve. It seems that everytime a guild or alliance fades it doesn't explode but instead implodes in on itself. I am sorry to see that the heads of the Alliance are in dispute here and that they cannot stand together in one common agreement as to the looting policy and the simple playing nice rules. I feel that I am standing on a hill watching an empire crumble under its own disputes. Please let us put this minor thing behind us and move on and become even a stronger Alliance. <br>
<br>
On a side note:<br>
I agree with hareq about the cookie cutter responses from other guilds wanting to join the SGA. simple fact is we could use more people to some of the larger scale raids such as the planes.<br>

I don't think the loot policy was ever really covered the idea of a non-SGA person in the group. Probably just an oversight.<br>
<br>
In terms of loot disbursement, I'm all for making sure people aren't inherently excluded from loot, provided the need before greed rules are met, and if the raid is generated to get a specific person an item (epic or otherwise).<br>
<br>
Here's a version of how this could have gone.<br>
<br>
Let's say the following people are in a group. Myself (Necro), Malleolus (Wizard) and Holt (Cleric). We are all SGA members. We zone in and UnguildedDruid wants to join ans we agree. The SGA members are in agreement that any spell drops deemed excess will be donated to their guilds coffers. But what about UnguildedDruid? Does he or doesn't he get a chance for the &quot;excess&quot; spell. My vote is yes. Here's how this could have gone.<br>
<br>
First spell drop is &quot;Celestial Healing&quot; and Holt doesn't have it so he gets it. Second spell drop is Translocate, but Mall already has it. A representative from each guild and unguilded Druid roll for it. Unguilded Druid wins the roll and receives the spell. Keep in mind a good chunk of the spell auctions I've seen have been one spell for another. So why shouldn't the Druid be able to trade a spell for it. Or sell it for all he cares. The fact is that regardless of it being an SGA raid, people who aren't in a guild should get a chance at something provided it has passed the NEED BEFORE GREED policy. My opinion is if we keep something away from someone who is a member of a pick up group we have shown the following:<br>
<br>
1- We are a bunch of elitist SOB's<br>
2- Since we are elitist SOB's why would you want to join the SGA or a guild in it?<br>
<br>
Keeping a drop internal to the SGA (once it has passed the NBG filter) IMHO is like having a lolipop at the playground none of your friends want (they hate chocolate) but keeping it from a kid who might be able to trade the cholocolate for a cherrry.<br>
<br>
I'm all for allowing non SGA people on raids. If someone behaves poorly they don't get asked back again. It is my hope we can avoid making the SGA an Uberguild. We all have to learn how to do planes at some point. Inviting someone we don't know on a raid shows an act of kindness that will be repaid later. Either from them inviting you on a raid or helping you out. Sure, there are going to be times when the raid is just plain full. <br>
<br>
It's a game. Why can't we have fun and get along with everyone, regardless of if they are in the SGA or not?<br>
<br>
If we die, we die. It's a given we are going to die in this game at least another 20 times.

Open dragon raids are different because old world dragons are relatively easy and is at most, a 3 hour encounter with maybe an hour of actual fighting involved.  When I go on a long, drawn out, large scale raid, I would like to go with people I trust and can depend on.  That's the common ground between all guilds, large and small. <br>
<br>
You shouldn't have to tell people the simpliest of instructions like mezz/root the adds, mana pump the healers.. etc, during these raids.  They should know it already.  That's the problem with completely open raids, so many people show up whom you've never seen or played with before.  You don't know if they know their class.  You don't know if they're capable of dealing with the pressure.  Even more so, and I've seen this many times, some people just don't contribute.  Some players just sit around and don't offer any useful assistance to the raid, while just simply expecting to get to roll on loots.<br>
<br>
Sorry, I will no longer participate in any un-moderated, &quot;completely open&quot; plane raids because the probability of that raid succeeding is 50/50 at best with the new changes to planes in place.  I certainly do not feeling like going on a 6+ hour CR.  Just look at the past few open plane raids.  Didn't H&amp;E had to rescue corpses from both PoF and PoH just a week and half ago? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uholtthecleric.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Holt the Cleric</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/17/01 10:17:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=151.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: State of the Union address</span><hr size=1> As far as open raids go I will no longer even group with non-SGA members if I don't have at least one other SGA in the group with me. I agree with Telivak in the simple fact that SGA members we hope are more loyal to the cause than just some guy that was picked up to farm phatz l3Wtt for his self or to fatten his pockets. Just this past weekend I have had horrible experiences in not grouping with SGA members. I ended up having to res an entire guild in Kedge because the thrown together group didn't know how to interact with each other.<br>
<br>
A thing that I have noticed more and more are high level newbies. I am so tired of seeing someone simply now know how to play there class. They were either Power Leveled up and don't know the role they are suppose to play or they found a nice static spawn to level off of. For an example I saw a level 47 cleric in Karnors and he was actually attempting to meelee the dogs with his uber hammer. I just watched helplessly as his group members died one bby one as he nuked and hammered the dogs. I of course ressed them all he was removed from the group and I was his replacement. &gt;<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
 <br>
<br>
Back to the point:<br>
If we are to learn to interact with each other and learn to take up in each others weaknesses and be a strong alliance of guilds then I think we should have SGA raids in which there are SGA groups and loot goes to SGA members. <br>
<br>
But, in the same respect I think that the SGA needs to gain a good reputation for allowing people to come to its raids and that we have a good group of people that will help others and have the Need before Greed looting policy. <br>
<br>
Loot to me is nothing really. Granted I do want to be all purple, but I have played since beta and I got one helm of purple to show for it ... I can wait <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
