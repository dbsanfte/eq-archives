I have come to bring you the story and news that many of you could not understand , if you can at all. My character Caolite has served approx. 34 days and 18 hours online, a little more than a month of straight playing time, of adventuring, of mischief, of great times, of horrible camps, and most of all this beloved guild. My soul longs for something I do not see coming in the near or far future for wizards. Many complain or (my apologies), bitch. I have tried to stay away from this attitude for as long as I could muster, with the exception of joking with my RL friends. However it has saddened me very much and come about like a blow to the head.... I have realized how truly lost, broken, untouched, and experimented on wizards seem to be, yes I know I signed up for it, but what I got was something I never thought would be missing, I took pride in my class before this blow to my conscious. I took the greatest pride in traveling and blasting, I took pride in having the ability to port others around and to do it for free (almost 98% of the time), I took pride im my guild and everything that I could help it accomplish. It was then that I started to notice something.... I felt incomplete, but why? I could not answer this question, but I knew deep inside why. The days turned the seasons changed and I was still the same I was since level one... root.... blast (or try) ... root break.... or not take at all... get smashed into the ground..... die ..... I know, I know what that sounds like, I really do, it sounds pessimistic, unsound, unproved, and mostly like I couldn't play a wizard right. You have me wrong, I like to group, it is part of what makes everquest a great game. Yes I can get into groups ... most of the time... I wont fall back on the &quot;nobody wants me in their group&quot; , the requests weren't so bad. After we grouped for a while, many a time groups would discuss dmg, then most would be shocked or simply not impressed amazed or even thankful that I do 380 dmg blasting with half a bub of mana. Not when necromancers have stackable DOT spells and when clerics heal and when shamans buff and when enchancters have clairity and mezzes and when mages blast and have a pet to help them take out annoying yard trash or even help in a fight as it roots constantly, after that point people suddenly didn't like me or respect me as much as they might once have, instead of &quot;Meatshield tells you, &quot;Wanna join our group? you would be perfect.&quot; Its &quot;Meatshield tells you, &quot;Can you port me or translocate me to NK so I can get back to my group.&quot; I admitted this was not what I had in mind when creating this character, but I dealt with it, didn't mind it, no boats right? Wrong, Qeynos is the bane of everyone existance, especially wizards who get requests for ports for as close as one can get and people yell when they find out that my WK port is close to NK. Well take a look at www.graffe.com, he is our voice, but wait, look at that logo, that wasn't always like that, change is good, unless your a wizard. I get more resists, partial blasts, and interrupts for no reason other than standing still, than I care to even think wizard is even worthy to fight with other classes. For these rants and reasons are some of the things I can understandably put into words over how sad I am that I will never make Sorcerer, never achieve my wizard epic, or port someone to The Planes of Sky and Hate. It will never tell how sad I am about how a nice wizard Eberwhar and the guild Mithril Blades helped me with getting such items that made being a wizard standable, such as my Staff Of Temperate Flux, Staff of the wheel, or even encouraging me in my Jboots quest. Yet I have noticed something, other than the few select wizards we have had or have now, I think maybe 2? I have seen wizards drop like flies to other classes, and now I know , that they did not betray wizards when they left such as I am, they were betrayed by VI themselves, even I have not seen Eberwhar, my wizard mentor, on my friends list in ages, I wonder if he found the same thing as I. Not all wizards will agree with me I know this, others may not defend my choice but rather ignore it. However not once did I hear a complaint about me in the wonderful guild that I belong to. For that in the distant future, Caolite might live once again, but for now he is broken. For that and all that you have ever helped me with I am returning, I hope, some of those things that the blades helped be achieve or let me borrow in the quest that was Caolite's life and I thank you beyond words to everyone who made me feel at home...... and important. For all of these things I ask you to understand why I have no more hope for wizards of the past, of now, and of the future, we will always be lost, beat, torn, tired, and mostly disgruntled. Remember, wizards never die as a result of poor treatment, they all just eventually fade away...<br>

I'm in a medium sized guild and I am currently 1 out of 2 wizards present. A guild of about 60 people (alternates not included)has only 2 wizards and zero wizard twinks. I am the highest level wizard at 44, and still I get the request for ports more then requests for damage dealing. My guild is friendly and all, but I find myself ranting even to THEM when I am frustrated. This is not why I wanted to be a wizard - to port! And yes, I have had the exact same thing happen to me when the group asks how much damage I'm doing. The worst case was when I was level 42 and grouped in frenzy in lower guk. A level 49 mage, in the group, was complaining that I was a waste to the group and he could nuke 3 times harder then me - plus his pet would contribute. It got to the point where I wondered why I even existed as a class. Sure he was an asshole cause he's 2 spell levels higher than me - but when I told the cleric leader (level 43) how much damage I could do, the cleric just sighed. <br>
Fortunately for me, that same mage was told off later cause his stupid pet kept breaking them mezzes and he kept agroing. The enchanter finally casted invisibillity on him - and POOF no pet! <br>
