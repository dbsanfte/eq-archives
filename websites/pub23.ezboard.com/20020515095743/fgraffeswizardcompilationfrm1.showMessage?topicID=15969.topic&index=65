It would be like having EQ where your Race choices were Human and Dark Elf, and for Classes you had 13 flavors of Warrior and Wizard.

So they both start off with a zero in Handguns, and while the bounty hunter has a cap of 10 (to keep it in EQ terms), the Jedi has a cap of 5. This continues throughout his career.<br>
<br>
It can CERTAINLY be balanced.<br>
<br>
Grimstaff, honestly, I challenge you to go pick up either the Wizards of the Coast RPG or the old West End one (you'll need to look on eBay, although most people say it's the better of the two RPGs). Then read the rules. Notice they are balanced and do keep the flavor and reality of the Star Wars universe intact.<br>

<br>
Didn't they say SW:G is not class based but rather Skill Based?  So basically any Non-Jedi concept you can come up with, I can make a Jedi with the same skills.  I'm sure your specialized character will have better skills, because you don't have to spend points on Jedi stuff, but if I can have a Fighter Pilot or a Jedi Fighter Pilot, I'll take the latter every time.<br>
<br>
As for your Druid analogy, it isn't the same for precisely that Class vs Skill reason.  But if they dumped all of EQs classes into a big pool and let people custom design, I do think the majority would choose to be able to cast Spirit of Wolf, Snare, and at least 1 DD, 1 Heal, and 1 DoT regardless of however else they built their character.  Not all but most.<br>
<br>
The Star Wars universe is a bunch of normal people with Skills and Equipment, and a handful of people with special powers.  A large portion of players are going to be drawn to the idea of being Jedi.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  And if they were that worried about everyone being Jedi, why aren't they trying to restrict bounty hunters? Look around: Almost everyone wants to be a bounty hunter since they can't be a Jedi right out of the gate. Who the hell are these guys going to be hunting?  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Because after Jedi, Bounty Hunters are a very popular character concept.  I'm not arguing either way, I'm just saying that Jedi and Bounty Hunters should be somewhat rare, but I imagine will be both extremely popular.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;  And to complete the comparison you raised, do you really think you'll see many players in SWG who aren't human, Zabrak (Darth Maul's race, /groan) or Wookiee? I suspect that, when I play that first free month, I'll be the only Twi'lek I see most nights.  &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You are correct, those will be popular.  I would consider Twi'lek myself if I go with a criminal/shady background (and depending on how the graphics look).  I'm just admitting that the lure of wielding the Lightsaber is a strong one.<br>

I don't think that what you're proposing here is possible, Eliezer.  From what I understand, here is an extremely simplified version of how SW:G skills will work:<br>

A character who has advanced to maximum experience will have (simplicity) 10 skill points.  So, I can have a Pilot with Piloting 10 or a Pilot with Piloting 5, Jedi-stuff 5.  Assuming that Jedi-stuff has no influence on Piloting, the Piloting 10 guy will flat out be a better pilot.

I agree.  I am NOT arguing that Jedi can't be balanced.  I'm sure they can.  I'm just saying that Jedi are going to draw a lot of people.  And if you log onto SW:G and every other person, or even every third person is a Jedi, that totally alters the genre.<br>
<br>
They have said they won't make being a Jedi 'luck based' (ie only some characters will have enough midi-chlorians or whatnot - be 'strong enough with the Force') and they won't make it so only die hard power gamers can become one.<br>

How powerful are Jedi supposed to be Grim? As powerful as wizards in EQ? I know you won't agree with that. I've been reading your posts for almost 2 years now.<br>

I can see it already. Grimstaff the Jedi Padawan on the main SW:G boards saying how Jedi are too weak in the lower game...<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Except there's not two flavors, Jedi and everyone else. There's a wide variety of things people can do. Why doesn't everyone in EQ make a druid, which, it has been argued, are pretty much the premier low level class? Because there's at least some balance in the game, and alternatives are viable.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Exactly! That's why there's wookie grooming and basket weaving type skills in the game. So people can do whatever they want. I'm a Grandmaster Fisherman in EQ, and fishing in EQ would probably be similiar to &quot;basket weaving&quot; in SW:G.<br>
<br>
The point is, there are a ton of different skills you can try (700+ skills so far), so it's not like you're being forced to play a single &quot;class&quot;.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  If there were starships, I suspect you'd have plenty of fighter pilots and smugglers and all the rest.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Piloting skills will probably be related to Vehicle skills, which they will have in the release, so becoming a Pilot in the expansion shouldn't take too much additional work.<br>
<br>
There will still be smugglers. That's what the Hutt faction is all about. I've seen alot of interest in the Smuggling skills. People are asking about if they'll be able to smuggle stuff without a ship, and so far the answer is yes.<br>
They just recently announced that they're going to have spice in the game, so that'll probably be a hot smuggling item.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And if they were that worried about everyone being Jedi, why aren't they trying to restrict bounty hunters? Look around: Almost everyone wants to be a bounty hunter since they can't be a Jedi right out of the gate. Who the hell are these guys going to be hunting?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
They are &quot;restricting&quot; the bounty hunting disc by making it an advanced profession similar to the Jedi skills.<br>
As for who they'll be hunting, it depends. Starting out, it'll mostly be NPCs via the mission system. Later on they'll be able to go after players, but they won't ever get to choose who they go after.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And to complete the comparison you raised, do you really think you'll see many players in SWG who aren't human, Zabrak (Darth Maul's race, /groan) or Wookiee? I suspect that, when I play that first free month, I'll be the only Twi'lek I see most nights.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Damn you Whiz! I was gonna be a Twi`Lek! Hrm, ok, I call blue twi'lek with lektu style TK421. You better not clone my avatar or I'll stomp you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And they're also ignoring the valuable shorty fanbase. Where are our Jawas, damn you? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You ever seen a jawa anywhere but on Tatooine? I haven't. Bothans are considered the shorties in SW:G. I'd guess they're about 1.5m tall, which is about the size of a Dark Elf/Wood Elf in EQ.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Didn't they say SW:G is not class based but rather Skill Based? So basically any Non-Jedi concept you can come up with, I can make a Jedi with the same skills.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Um, no you can't. Skills cost points, and deviating from your main discipline skills to say, learn how to cook, will cost even more points.<br>
So, yeah, you could be a Jedi that can cook, but you will probably not be able to be a Jedi Master that can cook. You'll have to trade in cooking to get more Jedi skills.<br>
<br>
Also, there aren't classes in SW:G, but there are Professions, which are sort of like classes, but you're not confined to one. You can pick up any skills you want, at the cost of more skill points.<br>
That's supposed to fix the UO scenario of everyone being a mage/fighter. If they stick two professions that would be very powerful combined on the opposite sides of the skill web, you'd never get to 50% skill in both.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Because after Jedi, Bounty Hunters are a very popular character concept. I'm not arguing either way, I'm just saying that Jedi and Bounty Hunters should be somewhat rare, but I imagine will be both extremely popular.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It should work out like this, from everything I've seen from the Devs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  You are correct, those will be popular. I would consider Twi'lek myself if I go with a criminal/shady background (and depending on how the graphics look).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I didn't mean to say that Jedi will be able to anything a specialist can do.  But if I was considering a character with some medical ability, and I could be a Doctor, or a Jedi Paramedic, I would strongly consider the latter.<br>

I am not concerned with Balance.  I trust them to do a reasonable job there.  What I am concerned about is that I'd be standing on a Planet with 6000 Jedi.<br>

<br>
You can have 6,000 Jedis in a game set just after the ending of Episode II. Granted, they probably shouldn't be signing any 30 year mortgages or anything, but it'd let everyone play the &quot;class&quot; so many of them clearly want to play, and people wouldn't get all offended at how common they are.<br>
<br>
Although, frankly, I find the idea of any Jedi at ALL beyond Yoda, Luke and (in theory) Leia in the classic trilogy pretty stupid. You're already breaking the set-up the movies have to include Jedi in the &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; shit, and all the games and whatnot. Frankly, I think all of that's a mistake. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujarnin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jarnin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/29/02 12:59:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15969.topic&index=85>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.interofficenetworks.com/demo/doh/jarninface.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You can't be a jedi, you can't be a pilot, you can't be a bounty hunter ...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
