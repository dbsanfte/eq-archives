In Neriak, there are sold Blinding Step potions, I'm pretty sure they make you run at SoCheetah speeds for like 18 sec, although it makes you blind for the duration haha.<br>
<br>
Soo..<br>
<br>
Creep up to a Mage+pet.  Down the potion, staying faced in a direction that leaves you plenty of room to safely run, and golem wand the mage (hehe no old pumice on sullen zek).  After the potion wears off, root+snare the pet, and put jboots up.<br>
<br>
Now, assuming he didnt control his pet, the mage is chasing with jboots, but he is pretty far behind.  Go back and take him on.  I'm sure you'd be able to get in 1-3 lures before he can wand the pet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uyilar44.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yilar44</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/14/01 12:48:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> GeeZ!</span><hr size=1> The mage can summon stuff for the pet that gives MR and give it to it.. and if the mage is smart he uses Fire pet, cause it has higher MR resist...

::casts elemental armor against flames:: Anyways, imo in a one on one duel smart mages can kill everyone except bards. Bards charm, pet poof. Mage gets beat silly. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's highly dependant on level though.<br>
<br>
From what I understand, a 50+ mage will have usually have this spell line-up: shock of blades (for interrupts, a 2.1s cast time with a knockback effect), scars of sigil (2.0 cast time bolt, absolutely essential), annul and maybe the malo line. <br>
<br>
Pet-wise, epic has higher mr compared to normal elementals (which each have their own resist line, and btw fire has high fire resist not magic), and a smart mage will toss some resist daggers on Gober. At 58, our pets can still be feared (valiant companion is 59), but we do have pet sow (velocity, 60% speed buff). Mages KNOW pets can be rooted/snared, and halfway decent mages buff pets accordingly. Summon companion also breaks root, I believe, but that takes 5s to cast.<br>
<br>

 As for the mage pet, it's fast because of Velocity. Mage spell, pet-only sow basically. 5% faster than sow. It's like when VI did some mage things they planned on making them own in PVP=) <p><B><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6122>Grimmlokk</a>, Forlorn</B> <BR>

<br>
In my example I used the PAL BotB.<br>
<br>
TZ representative was my guildleader - lvl 59 PAL, didnt (and still doesnt) have Fungi, had just gotten FD the nite before the tourney.<br>
<br>
I didn't get to see the WAR BotB, or the ROG BotB or the RNG BotB - I saw the PAL BotB and based my opinion on that.<br>
<br>
And that simple fact was that when I watched the Zeks fight against the other servers, they were NOT jousting.  Blue servers stood in one spot trying to whack away at each other mixing in occasional heals etc while the Zekkers were jousting.<br>
<br>
I'm not an eilitist moron - I know what I saw.  Perhaps an err in assuming other melees were the same - but that does not make me elitist in any way shape or form or a moron.<br>
<br>
Otherwise the same could be said for you by claiming every PAL had fungi and FD.<br>

<br>
60 wiz epic or not &gt; any non epiced mage<br>
60 wiz &lt;= epiced mage (depending on rolls and how smart mage is)<br>
<br>
I have 250 FR, i have done tests over and over on letting a mage nuke me, i thought i would resist all his shit easy with my fr.  Unfortuneatly I would say at least 50% of his scars was hitting full, uber fr or no.  <br>
<br>
Root on his pet was landing about 50% of the time.<br>
<br>
Couple factors that make a big difference, if the mage pet owner is using old school pumice or golem rods = dead wizard I don't give a shit what you say.<br>
<br>
Now without the insta dispells, we come into the luck factor.  Your goal isn't a big deal as a wizard. The key is getting 3 lures in = dead mage.  Root pet (cross fingers) start lure on mage.  If mage doesn't dispell his pet then he is a dumb mage and its game over.  If he goes the perma dispelling the pet then it can be tricky depending how smart he is.  Recast time on annul magic is a few seconds.  If you can get some good rolls and root sticks more frequent and you time the root to land after his next annul lands, then you have time to start your lure going before he can annul his pet (recast time on annul).  A really smart mage has both annul magic and nullify magic memmed which negates the recast time problem with annul, a smart mage should beat a 60 epic wizard but besides that, the rest is luck, a few resisted roots or interupts = game over.  <br>
<br>
My last battle had his pet breaking root and beating on me with 2 seconds left on my third lure and me channelling it through for the kill.  If i got interupted in that 2 secs I would of died, if one of my earlier roots was resisted I was dead.  <br>
<br>
So to summarize heh it can be done if your root sticks and he is slow to dispell it.<br>

<br>
well i guess most of you aren't a mage,so epic seems legendary to you.<br>
for non-epic 57  mage.their pet are 45~48.which is as strong as a mob of around lv 43.<br>
and the epic,it's lv 49.and consider that is as strong as a lv 49 mob.<br>
<br>
epic pet DON'T have sow speed.but mage can give a buff called velocity.which is faster then sow.<br>
<br>
i think you guys do know how strong a 49 mob is. it surely not a problem for a experienced wiz,but things isn't fun if there's a caster keep nuking you when you try to solo a 49 mob.<br>
<br>
yea everyone know rooted pet = dead mage.but don't mages know that?what a mage will do is :<br>
1)they have a summon dispell rod up before fight.and have 3 more on ground on their bind point.and one point is already told , it doesn't need to wait a root to land to cast dispell.if the mage really choose to play the root/annul game with you.the pet will eventually get to hit you ,it just matter of time.(that's not quite wise for a mage IMO,it just depend on luck)<br>
<br>
2)send pet---run ! don't think mages are stupid enough to stand in range.<br>
what a wise one should do is run out of 200ft.then scar rocks!,it do get resis all the time, but it's the best bolt in pvp.he's out-range-nuking you.you're dead fool you try to bolt him back.and you're on a big disadvantage if you chase him up,cos no matter how fast you cast he will be able to run out of range again.he isn't going to have a chance cast nuke if you keep chasing him, but he IS winning.cos it's just like inverse kiting of melee mob(you're the mob,he can't out run you,but you can never chase him close to have that amount of time to cast ,meanwhile pet kicking your arse.you won't outrun his pet.(btw,non-jboot mage=sux mage)<br>
<br>
this is the only way mage stand a chance against necro taps.and we don't have fear and bones dealing with mage pet to buy us time.we either ignore it(and get killed),or deal with it(and get nuke?no ,sux mage nuke you.wise mage don't.see the next point)<br>
<br>
3)send pet ---run(and gate) ! yea, the same idea.wise mages care not about feared/rooted/snared pet.cos it will break.just as long as the mage don't die.his opponent have to deal with a mid 40 mob.this the the main point.run or gate to somewhere the opponent don't know.the pet will come back bashing opponent when fear/root/snare breaks.(out-range-nuking rocks,but the BEST one don't.it just tell you where the mage is.the worst are yet to come....)<br>
<br>
4)chain casting pets.you think i'm the biggest fool right?10 secs cast time for normal pet and 18 secs for epic.no way any mage can do it in pvp fight.it's true.<br>
<br>
btw do you know how a mage solo?mobs only follow arggo rules,they don't know they can easily win by bashing the paper caster for a few secs.they fight mage pet and get killed.<br>
<br>
player know mage have no defense but the pet.so avoid the pet and kill the mage with ease.<br>
<br>
sux mage try to help their pet in pvp.but ALL mage do NOT help their pet in solo.cos pet are just a malachite.<br>
<br>
sux mage force you to deal with your pet by annul opponent's fear/root/snare.wish one don't.as i said in point 3.they break by itself.just a matter of time.mage nuke are good,but are nothing compared to wiz nuke and taps in pvp.only way not to get nuke is run out of the range.wait the pet back.they are going to win once the fight gets long.mage pet are the strongest in game .NO PC can fight 10 hrs non-stop,but the pet can. as long as the mage is not killed,the pet is going to spell doom for ANY player.you'll eventually come up with an idea of finishing the annoying pet first.and the mage had succeed.he turn around,look at you fighting the pet.chain cast.<br>
yes,it's 100% winning situation for the mage if anyone finally get tired for the pet and decided to kill it.it's talling about soloing a mid 40 mob NON-STOP.you can't do more then 5 in a row.normal people won't be able to kill the 3rd.but anyway you'll know you're consumed even if you notice the situation after finishing the first pet.it's too late.<br>
<br>
well you do know ,everyone of us do know we can't fight the pet.but mages will continue to do what i said in point 2,run out fo your range.you can't kill him,nor does he can.but he's on the upper hand in this case.pet is going to land a hit on you from time to time.it's annoying.and you'll make stupid decisions after 15 mins chasing the mage.everyone just get tried.<br>
<br>
---------<br>
guess you have a general idea of how a real mage fights.now pls don't say mage sux in pvp.cos those you seen are sux mages,not mages sux.get it?<br>
<br>
on the other hand ,mage DO sux ! and sux sooooooooo much !<br>
<br>
mage is is damn strong.but mages are papers.in fact the only defense for mage is run,run like hell(no jboot=sux) .it happens there are many place in norrath a mage got no where to run to.say highpass?or any indoor dungeon.key to win is to pick the place to fight.you damn stupid to fight a well prepared mage with a fully buffed pet in gfay or sro.<br>
<br>
yes they are strong.<br>
just don't punch on someone's blade,punch his nose.<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
just wanna clear up a common misconception about mages can't chain cast epic.yes they can.just not able to chain cast as many time as they wish. a prepared epic mage got 3 epic pet ready when a fight starts.<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
btw,there are very few epic mages out there,the quest is cool in terms of role playing(after you mastered 4 elements you got a pet of combined strength:HP,DD,stun,DS.it's dream of every mage).but it sux to get it done.epic mage is very rare.and normal pet isn't that fearsome.<br>
<br>
------------<br>
any opinion on waht i say is welcomed =)<br>

Epic pet is a bit harder. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvexxed.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vexxed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/26/01 2:54:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: how mages pvp</span><hr size=1> I played a mage to 57. Currently playing a 53 wizard. In a duel with an epic mage(pet buffed correctly) it's all luck for the wizard to win. One resisted root, and you're pretty much meat. Like Ace said yonder is your only option. All of us being wizards I think we can agree that you have better odds of winning a mega bucks jackpot in Vegas, than Yonder putting us in an ideal spot to pvp from :P. But when it does, don't we look UBBER. <br>

<br>
If you DUEL a mage, for some reason, there is a bug that does NOT allow them to dispell a root.  <br>
<br>
This is why any of you on blue servers are claiming how easy it is etc.<br>
<br>
Try it in the arena where there is no duel bug.  This is probably the biggest reason why the wizards on PvP servers are screaming &quot;are u nuts??  Epic mages are hard as hell&quot;, and blue server wizards are saying &quot;root and its over&quot;.<br>
<br>
Just a thought.  And props to whoever mentioned this - I totally forgot about the duel bug.<br>

The way i duel mages without epic is easy, 1 spell.<br>
distingrate (sp), first thing do that to thier pet, poof its gone, in most cases all non epic mage pets and necro pets even at lvl 60 are capable of being distingrated.<br>
Dueling a mage...<br>
Distingrate thier pet, and nook, woot hard :P if u have epic and the mage actually lands a few nukes on u and messes it up, yonder/shadowstep and reapply or something. but that isnt even neccesary in most cases, u will outnuke the mage.<br>
Dueling a necro...<br>
Once i got lvl 60 and epic i havent lost to a necromancer yet.<br>
Before the duel or before you get ready to attempt to pvp a necro, do a few simple things. first if your level 60, cast see invis, and like elemental armor or something, then apply yer ac/hp/mr buff, epic, resistant skin, manasink, etc, after that, cast annul on yourself. this &quot;Should&quot; dispell your first 2 buffs, if it doesnt try over again, but it always does for me.<br>
steps. <br>
Distingrate thier pet. while ur doing that they r prolly gonna try a dot or tap or something. i'd annul them, by this time u mite have a dot on u, but hey, u left 2 slots on top of your good buffs open, so simply annul yourself, then nuke him to death, sometimes the nec can harmshield or whatever, but u can nuke him down faster then he can tap it back.<br>
thats just a simple strat ive used, shrug<br>

This coming from a 60 wizard on TZ who has fought every 60 mage there is with an epic, and the Reputation to be the greatest wizard pvp on the server.. My encounter with mages.. There awfully quite easy.. The pets MR is not that high you dont exzactly have to keep it rooted.. 1 root , Sunstrike , 2 X draught of fire the pet.. Your probably saying to yourself right now but the mage are hitting you .. true root will probably break after the first Sunstrike, so you will have to channel 2 draughts of fire.. By this time your epic skin will disapate maybe .. Dont worry Mages nukes are puny if you have high resists/hp you should be able to laugh at the mages fire power,even with mala on you but you need some pretty insane gear to do that :P.. Mage w/o pet = very very weak 3 or 4 lure of ice will drop him pretty easy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . You should end up with more then half your hp left..  BTW dont worry about him dispelling his pet since epic pet has a good 3-4 + more buffs on it before he gets to dispell root..
