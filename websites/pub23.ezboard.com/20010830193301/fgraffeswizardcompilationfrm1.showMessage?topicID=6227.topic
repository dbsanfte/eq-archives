We all know the mage has the root pet, but we have the nuke, lets demand Verant and Sony to let the rest of the people see the damage we do.

I remember once some mage was trying to solo a frog in Seb but got 2 at entrance. He died (didn't ask for help and was too late to realize) with one mob down maybe to 75-80% health.<br>

For everything else it's reported anyway; if you simply must see it in blue before you believe it, use a highlighter on your screen.<br>

(How can you possibly have a roleplaying macro? Roleplaying inna can? I don't get it.)<br>
<br>
I suppose tanks can have their little incoming keys to peck, and very occasionally the 'healing xxx' button saves double heals. I don't regard 'making tanks feel secure' as a valid reason -- if they feel insecure and get the heal, they're wimps in my book. If they feel insecure and don't get the heal, what are they going to do? Run?

I think? All these blasted re: blank s</span><hr size=1> Actually, I'd rather not have it shown all the time. Instead, I wish there was a way to refer to a line in the chat box with a simple % command. For instance, for your last spell cast, you could say the Spell message that you recieve from a casting.<br>
<br>
Like %nm would quote the last non-melee damage message you got. That way you could set up better macros. for instance, you could macro;<br>
<br>
a mature cromodrac' was hit by non-melee for 1120 points of damage.<br>
<br>
like this:<br>
<br>
/g %nm<br>
<br>
where %nm would be the message, and since you started with /g, it'd say to the group &quot;a mature cromodrac' was hit by non-melee for 1120 points of damage.&quot;<br>
<br>
It'd only work off your last reported non-melee damage, so you could report resists, or full hits. It would be very useful for other things as well.<br>
<br>
For instance, if there were a %auction command, you could either report your auctions, or by using %auction &lt;playername&gt; you could report another players auction to your group, guild, or whoever.<br>
<br>
I don't want macros that make fighting easier, I want macros that will enable me to communicate better in game. Afterall, this would probably free up alot of the /ooc channels and /shout channels on raids.<br>
<br>
There are so many different % commands they could put in, it's scary. I just hope they do it someday. <p><center><br>Jarnin Fisheermann<Br><b>Disciple of Hate<Br><b>Rallos Zek</b><Br></b><Br>Grand Master Fisherman<Br>Master Brewer<Br>Master Chef<Br>Master of Begging<Br><Br><b>DEATH TO AL`KABOR!</b></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uzhaun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zhaun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/14/01 7:36:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Subject Needed...

I love to see macro's when something gets snared, charmed malaised or whatever. This helps me and other group members immensely. sometimes one misses the text that shows on the screen when say somethign is snared. <br>
<br>
As far as screaming out how much damage I do with a macro is a waste of time IMO. It clutters the chat window with something that isn't necessary.  If you feel you need to tell your group how much you are doing then your group need to wkae up. I don't see too many tanks taking away half a mobs health with one swing of their migty sword.<br>

The melee's never notice what we are doing... but the clerics do.<br>
<br>
For a wizard, grouping is a privilege that I could care less about.  Grouped I get 1 yellow per hour.  Ungrouped, it's 1 yellow per 1 1/2 hour to 2 hours.  Just takes me twice longer to level ungrouped.  In the long run, that's a level per 5 hours grouped, 1 level per 10 ours ungrouped... OUCH.<br>
<br>
Was on DL the other day.  A melee heavy group with 1 cleric had a monk leaving.  They /ooc'd looking for more so I sent them a tell.  So I sit there do my usual nuke and med thing, stay under the agro radar.  About 10 minutes later cleric sends me a tell asking me what I'm nuking for.  I told him I'm doing around 600 dmg per mob and that I could do more but that seems to be sufficient enough for this group.  What I didn't tell him was I was throwing stuns as well which makes quite a bit of difference on a mobs damage output.  A few more minutes later he sends me a tell again thanking me for joining the group.<br>
<br>
Well whoa is me... the wizzy who has never LFG'd since level 33 and solo'd mostly till 44 is being thanked by a cleric for joining their group.  A bit flattered... yes.  I just never thought I'd see the day that I could be a factor in a group.  But of course, only the cleric realizes this I guess it's because he was probably finally able to see a full mana bar.  The melee's do their own thing not noticing the benefits of having a level 44 wizard in their group.  I could care less at that point whether melee's notice or not.<br>
<br>
So 1 hour of grouping and I get my 1 yellow bubble, I decide it's time for me to move on because I just saved myself an hour of experiencing solo.  Time to meet up with friends and do some adventuring.  Did a /g I'll be going in a few... please start looking for a replacement.  Cleric sends me a tell again verifying if I'm really going.  Told him yes, then he says he's going too.  I told him he better tell the group.  He did... and that pretty much killed the group.<br>
<br>
I never realized up to that day how much of a manna drain for 1 cleric 4 melees are.  I never really knew how nervous a cleric gets when manna starts getting low with 3 mezzed drolvargs waiting to be killed(wizards just quad kite those buggers).  I was always under the impression that 1 cleric can keep 4 melees alive (also had 1 chanter that gave me clarity which made nuking much sweeter).  Maybe this was true from level 1 thru 40 with 5 uber twinked melees.  But in the 40's specially in the Dreadlands, where the Drolvargs hit for 108 every second... it doesn't matter what gear you have.  They will still eat you up and own you.  That's when class diversity begins to play a role.<br>
<br>
I could care less about showing my damage.  My presence in that group was felt only by one class, the cleric.  And frankly, that's the only class that needs to know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utorcerarcana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Torcer Arcana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/15/01 6:44:45 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: They need to see the damage we Wizzy's do!</span><hr size=1>      Give us the choice to keep it on or off.
