<br>
i guess what i was trying to sum up in the first post was this:<br>
on what basis do you think we as wizards are getting screwed?  where is it written that wizards have to have X ability to be a &quot;wizard&quot;?  can't VI make them as they see fit?  i mean come on, its their game.  can't they make it the way they want?  its a free country.  they put a product in front of us and if we like it, we buy it.  if we don't, we simply but it back on the shelf and choose another.<br>
<br>
Everquest is a game that YOU went to the store and bought for $29.95.  its not a freakin brand new car that has a warranty stating that if you aren't satisfied you had the right to demand service.  VI made no promises to anyone playing this game nor will it ever do so.  do you have the option to make suggestions?  sure.  but the attitude i notice from a lot of players after reading these boards for almost 2 years is that we can demand that they &quot;fix&quot; us and if they don't, they are stealing our money.  it's like you think Verant &quot;owes&quot; us something.  its so funny to see the responses after they change something.  i think some people are actually outraged and really get pissed of in real life.  <br>
<br>
i find it humorous.<br>

<br>
Anyway, EQ is this: get a mob00, hit it for x dmg, loot mob. Be that on your own, with a group or with collection of raid groups. Thats it. Sounds boring eh? Depends what flicks your switch.<br>
<br>
Forget this talk of 'well if you cant get a group, go an solo' shit. We dont want to hear it, we dont care, people like you just dont fucking understand one little bit. You miss the point. People may not want to solo, the fact that we can is irrelevant. You need to get this into your thick skull.<br>
<br>
So EQ is doing that, but talking to people (as a wizard, you must be the most socialable people in EQ with our fucking downtime), and therefore the social aspect is pretty much top of the list. If you play to solo because you dont have much time, respect to you. If you play to solo because you want to solo 8 hrs a day to get your level for weeks on end, you must be the kind of person who is on wave 50 of gems by now.<br>

These people (Verant) poured their souls into this game.  They got lucky and it became a huge success.  They have learned a LOT since they made the game.  They constantly make improvements.  They constantly try to balance the game.  They love this game as much as we do!  And most important, they did something they believed in and were rewarded for it.<br>
<br>
Now they can continue that success with more financial backing.  More experience.  More and more players giving their insight so that Verant can make the game better.<br>
<br>
We'd all be FOOLS not to open discussions with Verant when we disagree with something.  They want and crave our input.  Do you think they need the developers corner?  Hell no.  We'd all still be playing.  and we'd all still be paying.<br>
<br>
The idiots are the ones who think that Verant is out to get us.  That they hate the wizard class.  (how the hell does anyone even think that's possible??)  Get a damn clue.<br>
<br>
To the people who criticize Verant.. Good for you!  If you disagree with something, let them know!  Its when you get overly upset about it that the problems arise.  These forums are here to discuss things like that.  These forums are here for wizards to &quot;talk shop&quot;.<br>
<br>
Who is the idiot who decided that lv 60 wizards are the LEAST qualified to talk about the lower level game?  The pioneers of this game made it a hundred times better for you.  It used to be that lower level wizards came here for advice, and it still happens.  But some of you think that the old timers aren't qualified to talk about any portion of the game??<br>
<br>
There are a FEW situations that lower level players are truly not *qualified* to discuss portions of the end game.  Yet they get their panties in a bunch if its mentioned.  Its like your parents probably told you.  &quot;you'll understand when you are older&quot;.  Deal with it.  Don't get all self-righteous when someone disagrees with you!  That is what we're here for.  To spread different viewpoints and ideas!!<br>

<br>
I am not sure how you came to the conclusion anyone even hinted at this.  No one has remotely implied that they are the least qualifed, only that being level 60 and in an uberguild, raiding all the time changes your perception of the game and Wizards, and you tend to forget the past.  That's all true, doesn't mean you are an idiot or a monster, just human.<br>
<br>
I'd be hesitant calling level 60 characters pioneers.  Some of the may well be, but something to remember is that I met level 50 characters back when I was level 20 who'd never put anything into specialization.  I met a level 44 Druid who never trained Chanelling.  There are a lot of upper 50s characters that haven't been to many zones in the game and have no clue what to do in them or where to go.  Being x level doesn't make you guaranteed to be a scholar or an expert in anything.  It just guarantees you are either good at getting levels or have a hell of a lot of free time. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrimstafftheurgist.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grimstaff Theurgist</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.kestrelarts.com/images/grimicon.jpg BORDER=0> at: 8/3/01 6:43:10 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uloxinius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Loxinius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/2/01 11:27:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sick to death of the whiners !!!!</span><hr size=1> I think its a good thing that people disagree.

Yes, they raid a lot.  But, guess what?  They had to get lv 60 too.  And that requires a lot of grouping and xp hunting.  Sometimes you get in a &quot;guild group&quot;, sometimes (more often for a lot) you get in a pickup group.  We face the same damn things you do every single day.

You have this idea that an &quot;uber&quot; guild makes you somehow more special than everyone else.  That amazing loots are just handed to you.

level 40 Druid - approx 3.5 weeks play time<br>
level 31 Ranger - approx 3 weeks play time<br>
level 13 Monk - approx 36 hours play time.<br>
<br>
Each gets about the same play time per week, I started my Wizard first, yet my othere chars are advancing MUCH faster...I'm the same person playing all the chars...but my Wizard levels MUCH more slowly...<br>

This is fact, not some fool blowing off steam.<br>

Hey nonny nonny and a hootie hoo.<br>
<br>
Verant has said over and over that GROUPING is the main focus of the game.  They've made changes to the game and to classes themselves to discourage soloing.<br>
<br>
Sorry if you don't like the whining.  People do enjoy their wizards and want to play them.  But they get bitchy when they can't get a group and can't solo without bumming SOWs or camping jboots.  It's always been like this and Verant hasn't done a damn thing to change it.<br>

<br>
<br>
And I've quit trying to LFG's....<br>
<br>
<br>
And I've quit porting...<br>
<br>
<br>
And I've quit trying to educate the masses about the Wizard class...<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I solo, quad kite and nothing more...I try various mobs in different areas, some are neat, most just plain deadly. I get some varity of scenery that way.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for being negitive...well let me compare my various characters...<br>
<br>
level 40 Wizard - approx 1.5 months play time.<br>
level 40 Druid - approx 3.5 weeks play time<br>
level 31 Ranger - approx 3 weeks play time<br>
level 13 Monk - approx 36 hours play time.<br>
<br>
Each gets about the same play time per week, I started my Wizard first, yet my othere chars are advancing MUCH faster...I'm the same person playing all the chars...but my Wizard levels MUCH more slowly...<br>
<br>
This is fact, not some fool blowing off steam.<br>
<br>
Look again at the played stats and tell me that the Wiz class is balanced....<br>

Of course your wizard leveled the slowest.   Also, wizards are the class that least benefits from twinking.  Did you twink your other characters *at all*?<br>

<br>
As I've said before, yep yep yep, it's their game.  They can do with it as they please.<br>
<br>
I suggest they change it for a couple reasons:<br>
-Other games ruled with wizzies as powerful nukers, or awesome buffers/enchanters/utility people.  Before you put your foot in your mouth and bite my head off, note I said SUGGEST.  Other games did it well, it can work for EQ too.  SUGGESTION.<br>
<br>
-It's kinda expected.  This is a fantasy game.  Fantasy is generally build on D&amp;D, books, legends, and such.  Again, SUGGESTION.  It's an &quot;expectation&quot; simply because it's in the foundations of the genre.  If they want to make it different, that's FINE, it's their game.  It's my SUGGESTION because I like it the original way better. =)<br>
<br>
-They told us different from what we got.  At least in my opinion.  This is a quote from the EQ website.<br>
<br>
&quot;Wizards are second to none when it comes to casting powerful offensive spells.&quot;<br>
Mages are not far behind at all.  Wanna argue? Go look at the spell lists and compare.  No, not 100% of the time, but there isn't a large notable difference.  Large being the keyword.  &quot;Second to none&quot; means large in my head.  Seems like it's a notable difference.  I love being redundant.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Certainly, other magic users are proficient in their own areas, but the wizard is most effective in battle.       &quot;<br>
Yeah.  They just fixed that with the lures, etc.  Hadn't been true for 50+ for a long time, from what I understand.<br>
<br>
&quot;That is, as long as they have someone very sturdy to protect them from melee attacks.&quot;<br>
Generally always true.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me add to this: the original description told of wizzies as being the &quot;heavy artillery.&quot;  I remember that quote.  That also means &quot;much better than the 2nd best nuker&quot; to me.  This is not apparent to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
It's their game.  They can do what they wish.  Even if they told us otherwise.  I'm suggesting that they make certain changes to bring more balance and uniqueness to wizzies as a class.  And no, I'm not being a self certered little kid, I believe they should make changes to other classes as well.  This, however, is a wizzie forum, thus I post my wizzie related ideas. =)<br>
<br>
Flame me, whip me, beat me.  I'll always be back for more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

In other words... yes, we do have a 'right' to complain and state things to them. They appreciate it and desire it.<br>
<br>
No company in their right mind would reject all customer input.&quot;<br>
<br>
Being the cynic I am, it seems that they delete a lot of well founded and respectable (good spelling, etc.) posts off of their boards.  I imagine it's just spam they get tons of and are sick of hearing:  I don't read the EQ forums enough.  Still, it seems to me that Verant gives many customers good helpings of the ugly-stick-to-the-face, and yet they pay their $10/mo. without question.<br>
<br>
I hate big business.  Bad ones that is.  And although I lack the direct experience with Verant to form a true opinion of my own, I do listen to lots of folks who seem credible.<br>
<br>
I'm really just neutral.  I just seem like a cynic. =P<br>

<br>
I read somewhere that wizards level the slowest because of some wizard experience penalty and melee's would level the fastest.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong about that.<br>
<br>
Anyway I've twinked a Shadow Knight as well and by me being familiar with the hunting spots and able to twink this guy with my wizards Teleport money, he made level 20 in 20 hours.  Even tho he's an awesome badass that can chain pull solo to his pet because of the nice weapon and armor... I still enjoy playing my wizard more.  <br>
<br>
Even tho I don't have a negative outlook on my wizard, I truly agree with the concensus here that our damage has been 2 expansions due for an upgrade. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uennyaorcsbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ennya Orcsbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/8/01 8:52:19 am)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Sick to death of the whiners !!!!</span><hr size=1> Yarlin,<br>
   The main reason the wizard took so long is likely because you were new. No matter what level you were at at the time, you were new to the Class and the game. For example there is a wizard in my guild who in a period of just 2 months clock time has almost passed me at 36th level. It's about dedication to staying in one place to level, and hunting in the right places. <p>Ennya Orcsbane<BR>
