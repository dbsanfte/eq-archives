It is a great site. However I always wished we could expand the library (great idea Graffe) to have a section called:<br><br>Wizardry Rules, Limits and Specifications<br><br>This would not be a guide on how to play a wizard per se, but a living source document on things that we know or are certain of that people (including me) ask on these boards every day.<br><br>For instance you constantly see questions asking what a &quot;tic' is or what items can stack for mana-regen. Or how about Spell questions and limitations of all kinds (how many mobs does spell type &quot;X&quot; hit?, what is level cap of normal DD against level &quot;x&quot; and its likely effect?, Can a rain spell kill a mob?). How about what items and how many of mana-regen stack and what is their effect? <br><br>Anyways I wish to attempt to compile a comprehensive &quot;rulebook&quot; for wizards. Questions that get asked day-in, day-out. It is NOT a play guide mind you it is more a specification and an explanantion of the way Verant programmed EQ and how it relates to all things wizardly.<br><br>Here is the topics I came up with so far:<br><br><br><br>General Rules of Spell Resists:<br>        Comparison to other classes<br>        Inherent Wizard bonus Rules<br>        Spell book and medding<br>         <br>General Rules of Normal DD Spells:<br><br>General Rules of Lure Spells:<br><br>General Rules of Stun Spells:<br>        Pre-50<br>        Post 50<br><br>General Rules and Limitations of Area of Effect spells (AE):<br>               Point Blank (PBAE)<br>        Jyll’s<br>Rain<br>Pillar<br>AL Kabor<br><br>General Rules of Teleportation<br>        Self <br>        Portal Spells<br>        Evacuate Spells<br>        Translocates<br><br>General Rules of Root/Snares<br>        Various Roots<br>        Snares<br>        Stacking limitations with other spells from other classes<br> <br>General Rules of Items with effects:<br>        Instant cast<br>        Player worn<br><br>General Rules of Mana Regeneration:<br>        Explanation of “tic” and regen rate<br>        Regen Items <br>        Stacking limitations and effects<br>        <br>General Rules of jboots/tboots:<br><br>General Rules of Stats and their affects;<br>        Int<br>        Dex<br>        Wis<br>        Str<br>        Agi<br>        Cha<br>        <br>General Rules of Resists:<br><br>General Rules of Mana Items:<br><br>General Rules and Limitations of Levels:<br>        Newbie<br>        Planar<br>        Post-50<br><br>Anyways I am not the most Knowledgable wizard out there by far I am sure.

When a spell is resisted, it generates ‘aggro’ still.  Our nukes carry a big bang than other classes do for most levels and because of this, at lower levels, are spells create more ‘aggro.’  As you progress in levels the ‘aggro’ from our spell decreases slightly.  A resisted nuke in general creates less ‘aggro’ than one that lands for full (Confirmation?).  Another area of resists are the ‘semi-resists.’  These are where the creature has enough resistance to prevent a little, some, or most of the damage from the spell.  ‘Semi-resists’ generate a different amount of ‘aggro.’  The more of the spell that is resisted, the less ‘aggro’ is generated (Confirmation?).<br><br>Inherent Wizard Bonus<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When you obtain (35/50?) your receive a bonus to resists.  Past these levels mobs are less likely to resist your spells as much.  This is an advantage we have over other classes and allows us to deal more damage to mobs we encounter.  Higher level spells also generate less aggro (Confirmation?).  Another bonus we have over other classes.  With this bonus we can cast more with less chance of out-taunting the tank of the group (Warrior, Shadow Knight, Paladin, Ranger).<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br><br>Spell book and Meditating<br>If anything will drive you nuts, it will be meditating or ‘medding’ for short.  Meditate is a skill we acquire at level four and must be trained at a NPC wizard guild.  At levels one, two, and three, you can either sit or stand to regain mana.  At level four, this rule stays the same, but your mana regeneration rate is severely hampered.  After training the meditate skill you can click on your spell book and you will begin to meditate.  While medding you regain your mana faster than normal.  If you aren’t casting or looting, in most cases you should medding.  One problem from medding pre-35 is the fact you have to look at your spell to meditate.  This blocks your vision and you will have a very little idea of what is going on around you.  If you are in a group, you will need to pay attention to group chat to find when a mob is incoming.  Another indication that a fight is going on is your party member’s health.  While staring at your spell book you can still see your party member’s Hit Points (Represented by the red bar beneath their name).  If the party member’s H.P. begin to fall (excluding necromancers, unless it falls quickly) there is a good chance a fight is going on.  If you are soloing, you will want to find a safe place to meditate.  If you are soloing in a highly populated area, you can sometimes seek refuge among groups nearby for safety while you meditate.<br>When you reach level 35, meditating becomes less of a risk.  Once you obtain level 35 you just sit down and you will begin to automatically meditate without having to stare at your spell book.  While you still want to meditate in a safe position, you can switch views to get an idea of what is going on around you and determined if you need to move.<br><br>Spells:<br><br>General Rules of Normal DD Spells:<br>In most situations, these are the spells you are going to be using the most.  Direct Damage spells, or “DDs” are spells that do damage to the NPC or PC (If dueling or one PvP Server) you have targeted.  No object can be blocking between you and the target, but you do not require LoS (Line of Sight).  You can “nuke” a mob behind a tree (It is an object) but not a mob that is over a hill (The hill is part of the environment).  The reason for this is because as you cast, a “beam” is shot from you to the target.  If any ‘physical’ object is in the path of the beam, you will not be allowed to cast on it.  If the “beam” stays in contact with the mob, you will be able to cast on it.<br>A variation of the Direct Damage spells we get our bolts.  We only obtain three (Confirmation?) bolt spells.  These spells are a longer range than DD spells and in general, back more of a bang.  The limit to bolt spells is they require LoS.  You have to see your target in order to deal damage to it.  For instance, if your target is hiding behind a tree, your bolt will slam into the tree and your target will remain unharmed.<br><br>General Rules of Lure Spells:<br>Lures are a special form of Direct Damage spells that belong to the wizard class only.  Our first “real” lure spell we get is at level 52 in the form of Lure of Frost.  Lures are basically DD spells that cost us 320 mana to cast.  What makes lure special is that they are a very low resist spell.  Unless the target has huge elemental resists (Normally raid mobs, or certain mobs in zones such as City of Mist) you’re lure is going to land.  Since Lures are low resist, we can do damage to mobs that most other classes can’t even touch.  While your lure is not always going to land, we can still help out our group/raid by doing damage to a mob where most other classes are assisting through pets or mana pumping.<br>While our first “real” lure comes at 52, we get a “mini-lure” at level 44.  This lure, Enticement of Flame, is basically a baby lure.  It will be resisted more often than a normal rule, but it lets us deal damage to mobs that are several levels above us, such as those in the Planes.  It should be noted, however, that our Enticement of Flame is not the most mana efficient spell.<br><br>General Rules of Stun Spells:<br>Pre-50<br>You obtain your first stun spell at level 20.  Our stun spells differ from enchanters and clerics.  While theirs stun the target, ours stun the target and deal a small amount of damage.  Stuns have a long recast time and are not mana efficient to be used as damage spells.  When you first obtain a stun spell, you will mostly be using it on caster mobs to prevent them from healing or casting some sort of damage spell on yourself or a party member.  As a general rule of thumb, you should try and interrupt healing more damage spells.  A long fight can quickly sap a healer of his or her mana.  Not to mention, long fights will also sap you of your mana.  If your are fighting a non-healing class caster, then you will want to use these to interrupt their damage spells as they will normally greatly injury the tank(s) unless the tank has good resists.<br><br>Post 50<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Post 50 is when stunning really begins to matter.  At level 51 if you obtain Tishan’s Discord you can chain stun.  This will rob you of your mana, but it will save the cleric’s.  Chain Stunning is not always a good idea, as stuns generate a lot of ‘aggro’ and can quickly pull the mob on top of you.<br>A universal use of this spell is to stop casting mobs from gating.  If a mob begins casting a gate spell, you normally want to rattle off stun spells to stop them.  If a mob gates, your group is usually in trouble as the mob will heal and come back to finish the fight, often with a group of friends.  If the mob is level 51+ then you are in real trouble as these mobs can summon you to them.  A lot of raids go down because a caster got away and began summoning the raiders.<br><br>Interrupt Spells<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Another series of ‘stun’ spells we get are Interrupt spells.  These spells normally have a small stun attached to them to interrupt casting or interrupt casting by knocking the mob or player back.  We get a several of these spells and include Shock of Lightning, Force Strike, Thunderstrike, Force Shock, and Draught of Jiva.<br><br>General Rules and Limitations of Area of Effect spells (AE):<br>Point Blank (PBAE)<br>These are the spells that most wizards like.  Costing an respectful amount of mana, these spells will do damage to all targets with a given radius.  These spells radiate outward from you, and will hit anything within in their range.  These spells should not normally be used in normal grouping situations.  Breaking ‘mez’ will cause enchanters to have hissy fits and will most likely get your group killed.<br>The sole exception to this are in groups commonly known as “AE Groups.”  You will encounter these groups at higher levels.  They normally involve an enchanter, cleric, and wizards.  Tactics can be found in the AE Grouping Forum of Graffe’s.<br><br>Jyll’s<br>Jyll’s is the preferred PBAE spell. They are fast casting with a low mana tag and do medium damage. If you have any Jyll’s and are in a AE group, these are what you should be casting.<br><br>Rain<br>Rains are a special type of AE.  Rains hit the target(s) in waves.  Each wave has the same maximum damage.  Rain waves will vary from target to target.  When using rains on one target, three waves will hit. On two targets, two waves will hit per mob. On three or four targets, one wave will hit each mob.  Now, while rains are classified as an AE spell, they are very mana efficient.  Because of this, some wizards use them on single targets to do a lot of damage while not exhausting their mana supply.<br><br>Pillar / Columns<br>Pillars (Or Columns as sometimes referred to) are AE spells that can hit up to 4 targets in a small area.  Pillar / Column spells are used in multi-kiting (Or quad-kiting as commonly referred to).  These do a respectable amount of damage for the mana required.<br>Pillar / Column spells appear every so often in our spell list and mostly appear when we obtain another AE spell (Confirmation?)<br><br>Al’Kabor<br>--Can’t comment, don’t use them—<br><br>--I suggest in the final version we insert of table of Al’Kabor and Pillar / Column spells that gives mana, damage, level, and efficiency.--<br><br>General Rules of Teleportation (Need confirmation on all of these)<br>Self <br>The self Teleportation spells that go to a place other than your bind point first appear at level 20.  All teleport spells are named &lt;Zone&gt; Gate.  These will take you to the wizard pyramids / spires in the zone.  You should use these if you are not taking a group with you.  Spell levels for these are 20 (Fay Gate, Tox Gate, North Gate), 24 (Common Gate, Nek Gate, Cazic Gate, West Gate), and 34 (Iceclad Gate, Combine Gate).<br>At level 4 you can obtain the spell Gate.  This spell costs 70 mana and will send you to your bind point.  This spell should be up at all times to escape dangerous situations.<br>Word of Warning: The level 24 spell, Cazic Gate is not a safe spell to be use at the level you acquire it or for several levels after.<br><br>Portal Spells<br>These are the spells you use to take a group with you to another zone.  They cost 300 mana and will teleport all group members within a respected range.  You first obtain portal spells at 29 to Greater Faydark, Tox Forest, and North Karana.  At level 34 you will get portal spells equivalent to the 24 self gate spells plus Combine Portal to Dreadlands in Kunark (Ruins of Kunark Expansion).  At level 44 you will be able to memorize portal spells to the icy land of Velious (Scars of Velious Expansion).<br><br>Evacuate Spells<br>Evacuate spells are similar to portal spells.  They cost the same amount of mana and basically perform the same job.  The difference is they take 7 seconds fewer to cast.  The downside to this faster casting time is that there is a chance, a very small one, that a party member could be left behind during the evacuation.<br>Evacuate spells are used to get a party out of danger while inside dungeons.  They still take awhile to cast so you should plan ahead and be ready to press the evac button if you are told to do so.<br>There are some Evacuate spells that require you travel to certain zones.  Markar’s Relocations will take you to Emerald Jungle in Kunark (Ruins of Kunark Expansion).  Tishan’s Relocation will take you to Skyfire Mountains in Kunark (Ruins of Kunark Expansion).  **Note** The Tishan’s Relocation spell drops you in a dangerous location in Skyfire Mountains.  Wurms, drakes, and “chroms” wander over the arrival location.<br><br>Translocates<br>Translocate spells are nifty little spells.  They will send the targeted PC (Who must be grouped) to their bind location (Spell: Translocate, level 50), to any wizard spire locations (Spell: Translocate: Zone, Level 39), or to any wizard pyramid location (Spell: Translocate: Zone, level 44, requires portal chips).  Zone translocates can be bought in the Temple of Solusek Ro along with the portal chips.<br>At level 55, an “upgraded” version of Translocate  can be scribed.  Translocate: Group will send all party members, except the caster, to their bind locations.<br>Translocate spells require permission from the target to be casted upon (Confirmation Box appears for the grouped target).<br><br>General Rules of Root/Snares<br>Various Roots<br>--One of you root fanatics can fill this in—<br><br>Snares<br>Wizards obtain two snare spells.  These are Bonds of Force at level 29 and Atol’s Spectral Shackles at 51.

But you have probably heard your old grey-bearded wizard friend say that Root is still the way to go...well, why?<br><br>* Mainly, mana cost. Whether soloing or groups, you often need to use root for emergencies. 30 Mana is just nothing.....but it escalates, and 100 mana is a lot for the level 49 root.<br><br>* Recast delay. If a mob is pounding on you, you want to root as fast as possible. What happens if it resists? Well, with Root you just cast again. With Immobilize and Paralyzing earth, there is a 2.5-3 second recast delay, which can mean the difference between life and death when struggling to root a mob.<br><br>* Resists. Well, the resist check does decrease....but the question is if it really matters. I don't think so. When soloing or grouping you will often be fighting blue mobs, and when quad-kiting you will be doing VERY low blues. Resists are almost the same on these mobs, and the difference between Magic+25 and just Magic check will be minimal.<br><br>* Duration. It does get a lot better from Root's 48 seconds, but well...some people load up a higher level root spell to 'park' mobs for a long duration, others just root to get ahead of the mob if you're in trouble. Often you won't need the long duration.<br><br>Yups you guessed it, I'm in favour of the level 4 spell Root.<br><br>Be aware that this ends definitely with the level 58 Fetter. Fairly low mana, long duration, short casting time, no recast delay, low resist check. This is what you'll be using at 58, but the road from 1-58 is loooong. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umerloc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Merloc</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle><table width=111><tr><td style=filter:glow(color=#6633FF strength=1);font-family:arial;font-weight;bold;font-size:'1pt' nowrap><font size=1 color=#FFFFFF face=Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif>Site Sorcerer</font></td></tr></table></span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(11/4/01 9:16:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://faust.ece.ubc.ca/merloc/merlocface2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Al'kabor spells</span><hr size=1> You also have to take into account two other factors...<br><br>1. Channeling - If a mob is beating on you, channeling will help you regain concentration.  Lower level spells channel better.<br><br>2. Level based resistance... It's not in the spdat, but lower level spells are resisted less than higher level spells, I don't remember the level breakdown, but the resistance bonus is noticeable.<br><br>When you take these factors into consideration, &quot;root&quot; is the best spell to use for all levels, in almost all situations (exception: getting out of awareness range of an aggro mob).<br><br>Duration Formula is related to how (often?) checks are made to see if a rooted mob will break root.  I'm not sure if there is any difference when casting a DD on a rooted mob, but there is definitely a difference when the mob is unmolested.<br><br>Merloc <p><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="0" BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="#000000" BORDERCOLORDARK="#000000"><TR><TD><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="3" CELLSPACING="1" CELLPADDING="0" BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="#CCCCFF" BORDERCOLORDARK="#CCCCFF"><TR><TD><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="top"><B><FONT COLOR="black">Merloc Kole;</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="black"><BR><I>Ambassador</I><BR>Sorcerer <I><B>~</B></I> The Rathe</FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER=1 CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="3" BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" BORDERCOLORLIGHT="#CCCCFF" BORDERCOLORDARK="#000000"><TR><TD><FONT size="-1"><A STYLE="color:#3300CC;text-decoration:none;" HREF="mailto:merloc@graffe.com">email</A></FONT></TD><TD><FONT size="-1"><a STYLE="color:#3300CC;text-decoration:none;font-style:none;font-weight:bold;font-size:100%;" href="http://www.tindilosi.com/" target="_top">Tindi'Losi</A></FONT></TD><TD><FONT size="-1"><A STYLE="color:#3300CC;text-decoration:none;" HREF="http://home.pacbell.net/jr-rapp/TindiLosi/merloc.html" target="profile">profile</A></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE></TD></TR></TABLE><CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm25.showPrevMessage?topicID=39.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm25.showNextMessage?topicID=39.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=39.topic&index=11><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm25.emailToFriend?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm25.threadControl?topicID=39.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm25.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=39.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm25.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=39.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm39">MOB Resistance Information<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Luclin Spell Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Luclin Faction Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Luclin Quest Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Luclin Item Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
