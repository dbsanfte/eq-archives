I think continuing from 40 is a big thing since the time needed is going to be massive. I really look forward to 46 when I can finally play with you guys (I've done nothing but exp for literally 2 months when my character was created). I've just hit that time when I'm wondering if its worth putting all these masses of time into it and what I'll really get out of it in the end. I need a new quadding spot so exp has been slow wandering between groups, guess thats given me too much time to think.<br>Please someone rekindle my interest, I don't want to give up so close to what I've been working so hard for. I know this happens to most people I think but I really need some reassurance that its worth al this effort, like I said its a huge amount of time put in already (8.5 days, may not seem a lot in EQ time but think of it in hours), and, I guess I just want to know what there is to get out of the high end game (personal as well as in-game) and failing that a new spot to quad about so exp is too fast I don't have time to think  <br><br><br>post 2<br>----------------------<br>I was all inspired and ready to level after reading all your support and then had one of the worst 2 hours of EQ I've had. Its really putting me off, and then some. There've been a few people who've expressed concern and support for me (don't want to name names as someone always gets forgotten), and one especially who has exceptionaly kind and offering support. I'm now deciding whether I should carry on and struggle through or take a break from EQ. From 34 to 40 there were no worries as exp was moving so fast I had no time to stop and look at what was going on. But 40 to 50 seems a real bitch with limited groupage, but not much opportunity to quad either. anyway I'm diverging again, the reason I have got to 40 so (what I see as) quickly is because I've focused on exp but also because I've wanted nothing else but to get to a higher level so I can be equal to and join in with you all. I still want to carry on and I'm not sure whether to have some time off (I don't feel like playing an alt) or to carry on. My main concern is if I have some time off the guild will once again get further ahead of me and the gap to cross will only be larger. I'll try and have a think about it <br><br><br>post 3<br>---------------<br>Again had a chat with a few people today. I've put in so much effort and time so far purely to see the high end game, I made the wizzie with no other intention other than to get 50+ (well ok I could've chosen any class to get 50+ so maybe I wanted to be a wizzie a bit more than other classes). and I do so dearly want to see whats out there, and all the good fun raiding, and the wierd big monsters that so deserve an ice comet in the teeth  But I really don't know if its worth the effort putting in. The old hell levels, yeah they were hard work but you knew once you got past it the next levels wouldn't be quite so bad. As soon as I've got past the first hurdle I'll have 9 more to go, and they won't be any easier. Sure I could get to 50 with some dull xp grinding, but then if 50+ is even worse I really don't want to get there and have another maybe 240 hours played (or much longer) of being bored and fed-up just so I can get some real power at 60 etc. I could've played an alt to pass time but its not what I really want to be doing, and I'll only get to the same place with the alt and wonder this all over again. So I'm left with a couple of choices, either carry on or leave EQ entirely...<br>I'm still undecided <br><br><br>So there it is. If I carry on expect to see me on Antonius Bayle porting people about and generally quadding all over the place (I love quadding, such good fun), if not good luck with all your wizzies (and to the mages reading this who are bitter about our power *cackles*), I hope you have continued fun<br>Alluin<br>May all your blasts be criticals<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm22.showPrevMessage?topicID=199.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm22.showNextMessage?topicID=199.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm22.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=199.topic><img src=http://www.graffe.com/messageboard/add_reply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm22.emailToFriend?topicID=199.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm22.threadControl?topicID=199.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm22.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=199.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm22.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=199.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm41">Interface Design<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm40">Poster Made Polls<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm38">Discussion of Inter-Species Tension<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm37">Wizard Tales and Chronicles<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm33">Luclin Spell Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm34">Luclin Faction Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm35">Luclin Quest Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm36">Luclin Item Discussion and Info<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
