<br>
Ok, in a normal grouping situation, a wizard will generally be outdamaged by magicians and necros because of pets over and extended period.  BUT, remember that pathing sucks, and that pets can't be used while the group moves from camp to camp, and in many cases will wander off because of pathing.  Because of this, in most dungeons, pets are generally not wanted unless you stay in a camp the whole time, which is boring anyway.  <br>
<br>
Also, once the wizard hits level 55 or so, you have decent enough equipment where you can begin to really add to a group and not run out of mana as long as you get Clarity 2.  I did a test the other day, I get 13 casts of draught on a full bar of mana.  That's without Clarity or manasong, or anything like that, I just took a corpse at OS zone-in and started casting draught of fire on it.  At level 56 that's 688 damage per cast.<br>
<br>
So yea, the wizard DOES start to become a lot better, even with others in their mid 50s, the group DOES feel the presence of the wizard.  Snares, roots, and stuns added to DD, and with evac WILL make a good wizard desired for our damage output, as well as how well we can help a group.<br>
<br>
It's not ALL about the damage, though in large part it is.  Wiz epic helps as well, and the flowing thought items.  I know this wasn't the response you were looking for, but the fact is we keep wanting to be desired by groups.  That means for everything we do, not just damage.  I'd like to see some faster casting spells at the high level game as well for those times when fast casting means more than just doing damage.  Perhaps an 800 damage DD at 59 with a 2 second casting time.  This would be nice for those pesky greens and low blues that love to jump us.<br>

Druids are more hard pressed to do it quickly but do over time using DOTs and if they can charmed creatures.  Even an enchanter with a charmed monster can outdamage us (especially if you add in the extra damage done because of their speeding up tanks).  But I don't see the Wizard as being the most damaging OVER TIME.

I did not cast Manaskin before my Epic even when I would like to mainly because of the Peridot cost.

The epic is a really nice item and the effect is a really great, powerful effect... for a robe.  For an epic item Wizards get I'd see any of these making a lot more sense for Wizards:<br>
<br>
A super lure spell that did like 400 and cast in 3 seconds (resistances like Banes).<br>
A channelling booster that made it nearly impossible to interrupt your casting.<br>
A Casting haste and constant Breeze effect so that you can cast your spells 30% faster.<br>
A Super Malise effect that lowers resistances by 50+ on fire, cold, and magic.<br>
A Blast enhancer that gives 25% more damage for no more mana to your blasts.<br>
A PBAE gun that fired off Thunderclap for no mana and a very quick or no delay casting time.<br>
<br>
All of these are possible to do (with some creative programming) but all make a HELL of a lot more sense based on the concept of the Wizard class and would make the class no more easy to solo, but much more friendly to groups.<br>

As for your solutions as to what should be on the epic, I like them.  VI won't becuase unlike what you stated, most of those would greatly help soloist.  Heh, Grim, free nukes, free breeze, free resistance debuff, faster casting, and increased damage reads like a soloist dream sheet.  <br>
<br>
I have always thought the epic should have a free uber nuke to it.  Something like a 1K lure spell with a 12 sec recast.  After all, who's going to have epics?  End game wizards.  VI really doesn't have worry about these folks going out and soloing up to 60, they already are there.  A 1K lure would be very useful to these folks, and would probably do away with the need for Bane spells, but VI is kind of clueless like that.<br>
<br>
The funny thing about the recent announcement about making wizzies more group friendly is how does VI go about doing this with a class.  Mages got CoH, Necros got a way to donate mana to clerics.  Oh yay!  I can't wait for my new porting spell or the chance to let some other player make use of my mana.  That'll get me in a group and make me happy as a clam...no wait, that'll really disappoint me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utygrav.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tygrav</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/28/01 3:34:41 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://hem.passagen.se/cocker/tygrav.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: dream world</span><hr size=1> I just must reply to this.<br>

Pet´s are good but it´s not fun to send pet in and sit down on your ass again!<br>
CoH!? Woohoo now we get to be cabs, uber fun! NOT!<br>
Necro get to donate mana. O ya they loooooove that! Think not!<br>

And for the wiz that thinks there epic is not good enough don´t use it like warrior!!!!<br>
Warriors must have the suckiest epic in the game!<br>
Any warrior of level will get a much better primary weapon then the slow Epic!<br>
1k Lure nuke yeah right keep on dreaming!!<br>
Loot´s of people have there epic early 50 it´s just about how much u want it and how good your guild is.<br>

I´m not telling u not to ask for a 1k nuke I would love to have free nukes in my xp/raid group!<br>

<br>
I am a 52 mage that regularly, consistantly,always groups with a 51 Wiz, who always outdamages me and my pet in a fight.  As it should be.  By the time I have the pet where it should beget it on the right mob and start hitting malo on the bad guy so the wiz can hit full as much as possible, I am not contibuting that much to the fight in nukes.  So over a short figh, the wiz wins.<br>
<br>
Now you did say over time didn't you, well any fight you have that is going to be &quot;over time&quot; my pet will hit, but I will be resisted.  Mage resist is alot higher, I get to dmg shield, summon and malo the bad guy, when malo sticks, I get to nuke.  Wiz still beats me.  Right on with me, not a complaint, just an observation.  I have grouped with this wiz A LONG time, I was there for his frustrations in the 30's when I could outdamage him, but, nothing makes me happier now then to see him outdamage me, it is just a might ridiculous you have to wait for 44 to see that happen.<br>
<br>
And the other mage is correct, in many situations post 50, I am not taking my pet, you can dungeon crawl with a pet, but it takes concentration and skill, they really don't just follow you. In many situations, the thing that is supposed to be my signature, the pet, is not wanted nor needed. <br>
<br>
We all have issues, and the caster vs caster fight has been part of what has held things back.<br>
<br>
I like my mage, I like and respect wizards.  Work together to achieve an aim, not against one another.<br>

<br>
It very may well be... but at 55 (really earlier, but I gave away my JBB from 52 to 55 to someone who soloed more) 260 per 8 seconds isn't a nuke anymore... it's a sort of DoT.  Come to think of it, even a shaman's nuke at that level isn't much of a nuke... I tried to stop a runner with Ice Strike when I was soloing, and learned just how slow a 7-second cast blast is when you really need it (why yes, I did die <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
But it's fairly overpowered at 45-50... not that someone of that level can reasonably expect to have one.<br>

<br>
You're all over-estimating pets, by quite a bit.  Pets (especially necro pets) are easy as hell to outdamage.  One Sunstrike easily equals at least 1 minute of pet fighting... easily.  The only pet that may rival us is the epic pet, and even at that, it's still close.<br>
<br>
Epic effect is well... epic.  I know almost every epic-enabled Wizard couldn't be happier with th effect.  It makes us easier to maintain in groups (I rarly find myself needing to be healed, epic does the work) and gives us that little mana regen boost for soloing.  As far as epic effect on a robe... nope, sorry unless it required a component I totally disagree.  I like it where it is, it works well.<br>
<br>
JBB.  Overpowering, plain and simple.  The thing is, most Shaman who have them won't use them, and if they are they're soloing.  It sucks to just constantly click away /shrug.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I appologize in advance if this isn't making much sense... 19 hours no sleep!  Yeye insomnia is fun~<br>
<br>
Oh, btw, why is DD on epic gay?  Because then we begin to depend totally on our epic to deal damage.  That's just stupid and imo pathetic to rely on an item for damage. /shrug<br>

A charmed, hasted, chanter pet would outdamage you easily Rombus, it is just a bit more dangerous.. hehe.. And it ain't even close. <p>Qaman<BR>

A normally charmed pet can be outdamaged easily with a sunstrike every 15-25 seconds... depending on the pet (considering we're in a normal exp group btw). <p><BR>
