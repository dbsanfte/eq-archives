<br>
(taken from the developer's corner today)<br>
<br>
&quot;We have been receiving a fair amount of mail regarding the status of changes to classes based on the items brought up in the class talk threads that I started a while ago. Right now I have little new information for you, but let me spend a moment talking about this.<br>
<br>
The team has read and reviewed the lists that I put together. We've had several informal discussions about them, and a few formal discussions about specific items on those lists.<br>
<br>
So far you've seen a lot of changes based on your input. They have been going into the game as they get finished and tested. Things that didn't require a lot of in-depth investigation on our part, such as changing the Bread Pants for Bards, increasing the drop rates for many Kunark spells, fixing the Track Corpse spell and many others.<br>
<br>
And even some of the more complicated issues have been looked into. Things like giving Druids and Shaman the ability to act as secondary healers, upgrading Mark of Karn (a very complicated spell to balance), the aggro created by debuff spells (and, yes, the aggro created by healing spells), and others that have required a lot of consideration have been added or changed.<br>
<br>
We've also started on some of the much more complicated issues, such as Wizards and their ability to do damage against certain NPCs with the Bane spells.<br>
<br>
To finish the lists we'll have to make the time to have some long and complicated meetings over issues that can't be changed without rather a lot of effect on the game world. We have not had those meeting yet. Recently we decided that we would put PvP issues to the forefront, considering that lack of attention they have had over the life of EverQuest.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to let you know that we haven't forgotten the issues that you brought to our attention.&quot;<br>
<br>
So basically, they are not going to get around to it because &quot;we'll have to make the time to have some long and complicated meetings over issues that can't be changed without rather a lot of effect on the game world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Read between the lines - they will not get to fixing our class for another year if at all. <br>
<br>
God this depresses me. What a waste of an investment in this game and company. I can see why they shut down the boards. They really needed to due to the bad publicity they have been getting on not fulfulling what they have promised to do.<br>
<br>
For those of my fellow Wizards that are &quot;happy&quot; with your Wizard, you may have sealed our doom. <br>
<br>
What do I mean by &quot;our&quot;? <br>
<br>
My definition of &quot;our&quot; means the casual, non-UBER guilded gamer. We are the ones that are having to put up with this the most. Not the UBER, multiple sets of equipment, quested armor/robes, etc: type of Wizard. We are the ones having the most problems due to lack of resources, yet our supposedly &quot;pinnacle&quot; brethern as not really helping matters using their UBER sway to tell VI that everything is fine and dandy.<br>
<br>
Looks like the casuals get stuck up the *** again!<br>

Well considering he posted earlier that they were basically done with balance, that seems unlikely, at best.  Let's just say if they announced all work was done and they were not doing any more work ever... all hell would break loose.  Classes that have been boned by this idiotic decision would lose players even faster than they are now.  So its in their best interest to string ya along. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulndiglow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lndiGlow</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/11/01 7:58:41 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.togrc.com/legends/im_mgif/pl_wizard_mred.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Screwed!</span><hr size=1> &quot;Recently we decided that we would put PvP issues to the forefront, considering that lack of attention they have had over the life of EverQuest.&quot;<br>

Quickest bang for the time invested. Supposedly saving the harder issues up to last. <br>
<br>
In my humble opinion, they are trying to please as many customers as they can quickly, because they know they have seriously ****** up the gameplay for the majority of their audience. Whether they care about this or not - I think we all know the answer to that.<br>
<br>
The only players that are happy are the UBERs, as they still retain their UBERship and can lord it easily over the rest of the player base. Most new quests, items, zones within their new expansion are untouchable by regular players. Hence, the UBERs feel confident and justified in their position of perceived power over VI and the majority of the player base.<br>
<br>
And since VI mainly listens to the UBER player base, that is really only where their attention span has ever been, they feel that if they can cater and develop on this select customer niche, the rest of the player base will be fine. If the UBER base is having problems and complaining about their class/zone/situation, then VI will listen. If they say everything is fine and dandy, VI will put it's attentions elsewhere.<br>
<br>
Well - as listed here in some of the messages within this board - all or most of the folks saying &quot;Oh - Wizards are fine. I have no problems with mine - I wonder why you are whining and so upset? You must not know how to play your character. I suggest you start a different class as I find my Wizard SOOO fulfilling.&quot; This attitude is dangerous for all of the Wizard base, as it sends a signal to VI that Wizards are fine.<br>
<br>
If VI gets this feedback, of course they will not do anything as they have heard from our supposedly &quot;leaders&quot; of the class that at their level everything is ok. What they forget is that not everyone subscribes to play 6+ hours a day and belong to a large guild. Most do not. Currently, if you have a Wizard, you HAVE to be in an UBER guild to get the support you need. <br>
<br>
Those that have posted &quot;their fulfillment&quot; on this message board usually and quite proudly list their guild affiliation. Do me a favor - check out their signatures - look at their guild listings. I am willing to bet that 95% of them belong to large/UBER guilds and have all the support in the world. Now you see why they are so &quot;happy&quot;. I would be too if I could walk around with the lastest gear and boast I had multiple sets of gear &quot;depending on my mood&quot;.<br>
<br>
Well - VI still has not learned their lesson and as a result, had to shut down the regular boards as the player base that is damaged the most by these changes and upgrades are the casuals (the majority of the players).<br>
<br>
The UBERs are wrong. Post 50 game is dead for most folks outside of UBERship. Quests and equipment at this level are way above a casuals ability to obtain. Wizard effectiveness in group situations has been drastically reduced without the proper equipment - hence the vicious circle. <br>
<br>
At this point in the game, players are judged by their equipment in all situations. In looking for groups, folks look at what you have on as a walking billboard as to your abilities/experience. The better equipment you have, the better the chance you have at groupage.  <p>Aziz Al'Qadir

The guild I am in now is on the edge of being considered uber(some say we are, some say not quite yet), but in general, the ONLY groups I get into without a lot of grief are guild groups.  And even those who are in uberguilds know that wizards are screwed up in the post 50 game.<br>
<br>
They thought that doing 2k for 21 plat at level 60 to only certain mobs was good?  These people are idiots!  I've tried to post this, but Absor doesn't put it up that the problem is they are too busy working on trivial things like trade skills, rather than working on things to FIX problems.  Who cares about melee stat improvements because you can now bake a cake with magical effects?  Maybe some level 30s, but they don't have as many issues with the game, so don't need that.<br>
<br>
I can see it now, bake items that give a haste bonus for the melees, or perhaps give druids more abilities why don't they?<br>

<br>
I thank &lt;deity of your choice&gt; every day that I am at the very least in a *large* guild, even though we are very far from &quot;uber&quot;.   I am very lucky to be a part of that.... I was guildless for a long time, and it was a lonely existance.<br>
<br>
If you ever need anything in game, Aziz.... you can count on my help if I'm free....  It saddens me to see a wizard that I always looked to for hope losing his.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><hr>
