<br>
I did want to clarify one thing in concern of the Fear raid cleric belt thing.<br>
Kappaphi was wearing a crystalline belt, that he had on loan from me, and once he received that belt in Fear he had already given me back the Crystalline belt, so while his need might not have been as big as someone else, there was never a greed issue IMHO.<br>
<br>
Now I am just clarifying how it happened, I have no issues with it, I considered it to be a SGA before pickups thing, and we had accepted this, so lets move on.<br>
<br>
Hopefully in the near future, Dragonchow will be SGA members.<br>

one thing i would suggest is maybe /telling the people who are about to roll the stats. i didnt know anything about that belt, i just heard clerics roll, got stoked and randomed. i looted it and it was pretty much not what i thought planes loot would be. so i figured, maybe someone could use it more than me. my only intention was to at least get my roll back. thats all i wanted. besides that, i figured maybe another cleric would buy it for maybe 300pp, i mean just enough to cover peridot purchases. i would have, and did, give it away to anyone who needed. however, zenknight, i take MAJOR offense to basically calling me out as a farmer in /shout. that is a /tell thing man. and to insinuate that someone goes to planes to farm? come on man... what 1/1000 is not no drop? any one whos met me can tell you i spend countless hours at camps i have nothing to gain at. @#%$ last night i went to kedge with lyris for mermaid hair. im 51 and wear a CCS for crissakes. im sorry i didnt need that belt, but before i rolled if you would have just /told me the stats this whole thing would have never gone this far.<br>

<br>
Ok here we go. I did not shout out kappaphi is a farmer. I shouted out some time later, about a few kills actually that loot is need before greed and we are not rolling for stuff to sell. Loot was announced as Need Before Greed from the start. The only reason I knew you didn't need the belt is because the cleric said in group that you sent him a tell asking if he wanted to buy it. I did not name you in the shout but we had alot of non SGA people on that raid and I wanted to make a clear point to everyone at once to make sure we were all clear on that. You handed me the belt and I gave it to a cleric that could use it. As far as I was concerned all was right with the world.<br>
<br>
I'm really sorry you took offense to that. We all took offense to the fact that need before greed is a staple loot rule and when the tell came to our cleric asking if he wanted to buy it, well we all took offense. These things happen, after my shout (which did not name you or the item) you gave it to me and I thought this was over. If this is a sticking point for you, well I don't know what to tell you.<br>
No one thinks your a loot hound. I explained to everyone how you gave it back and no one holds this against you. Then again I'm not gonna apologize for the way I handled it either. I didn't name you directly and didn't name the item.<br>
<br>
You could have just stated in /ooc ot /tell that you couldn't use it and yes we would have given your roll back.<br>
<br>
Rabbizz No it wasn't an SGA first then pickup thing, All that go on our raids get the chance to loot the only difference being a 1 hour rule that applies to late comers.<br>

Only now since Hate has this seemed to become a major point of contention amongst us.<br>
<br>
I must preface this by saying I have been in Hate more than ayone else save Myriah, and have yet to loot one piece of insidious wear. Now if I could only come up with anything to replace that /random business cause we all know that I just have bad luck that way. But as of yet I cant, that having been said this is how I feel about looting.<br>
<br>
Everyone who shows up and stays for the duration of a raid should have the opportunity to roll on that which drops of their class. There are some of us who basically have to show up at every raid in order for it to go off. One thought on how to compensate that is an extra roll on one piece of said persons gear, to be announced proir to rollingby raid leader or assistant. As for latecomers one hour rule.<br>
<br>
My idealistic hippieish wish would be for classes present to discuss amongst themselves if any major pieces should go to certain &quot;vets&quot; that would benefit more than they could. Perhaps unrealistic it's what we've for the most part always done in my little flock. I've seen members of all our guilds performing random acts of selflessness so it may not be as unrealistic as i think.<br>
<br>
What I feel should be most concentrated on by our raiding at all should be teaching those who havent much experience how best to accomplish raid goals. When is it we got soo far away from this.<br>
<br>
 Loot has never mattered to me. Sure I want my halo and my robe and am bummed when I always roll a 3 or 12 on it but thats the breaks. I've always gone on raids to help people and find new and interesting things to kill and be killed by.<br>
<br>
 I mean I'm happiest in this game when I'm a little over my head in a situation that could wipe us all out. Thats the excitement and fun in this game is(for me anyway). Particularly in hate due to its gruelingly long nature we just dont seem to be having much fun. We need to find some way to quit the bickering during and post raid and have some fun with it. If we cant then we should not go back up there until we've matured more.<br>

One suggestion might be to have different rules for BP/legs and other drops. That's actually how TON handles it for their Kael raids. Laurri keeps track of how many raids you have been on and keeps this updated on the web site. The person with the most raids gets the BP/leg drop with no roll. Other drops are rolled as long as you have been on one raid before(more or less).
