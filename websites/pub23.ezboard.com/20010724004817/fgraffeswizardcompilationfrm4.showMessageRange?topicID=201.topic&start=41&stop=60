Incidentally, other classes than Wizards AE rather well, we aren't irreplacable in this.  We are just best at it.  If there were NO wizards in the world, this wouldn't have ever come up not because others can't do it... but because they don't have to.

lol, Beryl you sound a bit stressed. You play the game your way, and I will play it mine. But i do see your perspective on EQ, and it is as valid as those who wish to play be 'verants rules'. But i think you are trying to say that if you choose to play by those rules and are LFG for 3 hrs, dont complain about it and do something productive.<br>
<br>
I solod my wizard a lot, so i can relate to how you play EQ and how you are looking at how others play it. AoE groups are mega fun, and they are a real blast, literally. But this isnt a daily occurance, its normally the first 20 mins of a guild raid to just dispense with mobs to get to where we are going. Pickups for AoE groups are pretty hard on the server I am on because it isnt tried. Anyway, thats not my problem.<br>
<br>
Seems everyone goes for the same spawns for multi-kiting (i prefer the word multi to quad, because its normally not 4 that you get, but the name stuck), and raptors are 24x7 camped on innoruuk. Many other places for multi-kite though like the BW giant fort, and that served me well to level 55, for example.<br>
<br>
Bah, who cares anyway. We all play it differently. Some are not in it for powergaming and exp all the time, so like to have a nice easy room camp in sebilis, have a chat, logoff after a few hrs for sleep because they have work in the morning.<br>

I can summarize this relpy to your reply very quickly. You can have and keep your deranged idea of what kind of spasmodically-morphed groups wizzies HAVE HAD TO fashion because they can't get into your average, garden variety, group. I'm not interested in any hybridization that VI caused in the first place because of the way wizzies were nerfed. You apparently don't have a problem with that. You can take it....I choose to leave it. <br>
<br>
Next question please. <br>

Oh sorry about the KSing thing in the sense that it came out as being personal towards you....heh.....if not you personally, then certainly a natural extension of what can result if people resort to more and more soloing as you appear to be most comfortable advocating.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamadhibots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Samadhi BotS</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/01 7:41:26 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This board always crack me up...</span><hr size=1> ((Well Sandwhich BOTS, <br>

But is that Verant's fault?&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, yeah.<br>
<br>
How so? There are two main reasons:<br>
<br>
(NOTE: The following assumes low/moderate twinkage; high twinking is an artifact of older servers, and does not account for more than 80% of the players' true experiences advancing from low levels from the beginning.)<br>
<br>
1) For 52 levels, there is no such thing as &quot;potent&quot; wizard AoE.  The damage PER MOB per mana (the only important measure of efficiency, because if you can't kill ONE mob with the AE, you certainly can't kill groups of them) is low (EDIT: Replaced &quot;high&quot; with &quot;low&quot;) enough that it would require more wizards than a group could  have and still have other necessary components (enchanter/bard and cleric/druid, depending on level).  In fact, the only reason 53+ AoE is viable is because any two (very skilled) or three (moderately skilled) wizards will be fine for nearly any AoE encounter.  Thus, for 52 levels AoE is certainly not a viable tactic, so people stick to other ones that are more powerful.  Why change suddenly after having had a lot of practice for 52 levels? (There is a legitimate counter to this question, which I shall address presently.)<br>
<br>
<br>
2) The world organisation/size. Norrath is, to put it bluntly, too small.  It's got lots of eye-candy and little  substance.  Any given level-range has a finite number of places in which to &quot;hunt.&quot;  The number of these places is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  inversely</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> proportional the level-range.  That is, higher level ranges have fewer places to &quot;hunt&quot; than lower level ranges.  Ideally (from VI's perspective), there will correspondingly be fewer people in a given level range than the one before it.<br>
<br>
This is not the case, however.  VI has neglected a simple trait common to nearly every human being--&quot;comfortable&quot; environments.  Most people don't move regularly from house to house, or from job to job, simply because they develop an affinity for their current station.  The same is true in Norrath, as players inevitably project this sentiment to their characters.  Thus guilds and cliques form on any given server.<br>
<br>
Given this, and since every player will demand to &quot;hunt&quot; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  somewhere</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (inevitably they must if they are to advance their character), there must be some distribution of the huntable critters amongst the population.<br>
<br>
Now, 53+ AoE groups require quite specific classes.  A  cleric (very skilled druids or shamans might make do, but just barely; I've only ever tried once, and despite doing his best--and it was a damn good display--the shaman just couldn't handle the healing), a bard or enchanter (equally well, in my experience), and a &quot;puller&quot; (another bard or a tank of some sort).  The rest must consist of at least two wizards; preferably three.  Perhaps any combination of two wizards and a druid or 51+ magician (scintillation is nearly equivalent to Jyll's) would work on a good day.<br>
<br>
That is to say, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  an AoE group requires precisely the same &quot;core&quot; as any other group does.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  But the difficulty is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  much harder</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> than a Strategy(tm) (e.g., cleric, enchanter, caster, three tanks) group.<br>
<br>
And here's the kicker: because the number of &quot;huntable MOBs&quot; must be shared (or stolen--and that's a whole other bag of apples), there is very rarely, if ever, a place where the abundance of MOBs and scarcity of players make AoE as efficient as The Strategy(tm) (i.e., the mez-kill tactic).  <br>
<br>
Consider the numbers.  The 53+ AoE group has the potential to destroy from 10 to 20 or so MOBs per pull, and to do this two or three times before taking a &quot;med break.&quot; In my experience, it takes roughly 3 to 4 minutes to dispatch a group of MOBs with AoE.  So under ideal conditions, given that it takes approximately 15 minutes to &quot;med to full from zero&quot; with C2 at level 53+, an AoE group can destroy 60 MOBs in 24 minutes (ideal conditions, mind), or two MOBs per minute. Which is roughly three times the number a Strategy(tm) group could take given constant pulls. (This is the counter to the question posed in (1), above--why do it?  Because it's THREE TIMES the XP.)<br>
<br>
But in order to do this, there must be 60 MOBs available within the 24 minute span.  Now, my best estimate indicates that 60 MOBs at the 53+ level is a HUGE number.  It would encompass all of D1 and D2, and spill out into UZO and Necro in Old Sebilis, for example.<br>
<br>
How many times are all four of those places &quot;free?&quot; (Answer: never, on any server where Old Sebilis is hunted.)<br>
<br>
The natural counter is, &quot;So hunt somewhere else.&quot; Only, the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  same thing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is true of every other hunting ground that does not require a multi-group (2 or more) raid and has regular, short (i.e. less than 30 minutes or so) spawn times.  Why?  Because the number of places to hunt is small compared with the number of hunters. So 60 MOBS is a peak, ideal number.  Invariably, there will be fewer to hunt. Much fewer.<br>
<br>
And that, my friend, is not any player's fault. <p><font size=2>

I view the context of the thesis a little differently though.  Grim is correct that AoE is not quite practical at all levels.  Certainly it becomes a whole new ballgame at 53 with Jylls. <br>
<br>
However, once chanters have at least 2 AE stuns, then 2 chanters, 2 wizzys, a cleric and a puller can group--that puller can be another AE nuke class or a melee, depending on how bold and how buffed the person is.<br>
<br>
As far as how common AoE grouping is, or how possible to make it common, this is really up to the Wizard community and casters in general.  We allowed ourselves to have the conditions for having a group be set by the melee community.  They HAD to have clerics and then chanters to function. Melees were initially the most popular class made by new players, and still are.  As a result, they set the tone for what was done most often.  Subsequently, people tended to make more melee classes than casters because they found they could get groups more easily, and did not have the downtime hassles or book to stare at (the book is one of the most horrible things VI ever came up with--they are kinda backing off it that now, but it should be reduced to level 20 where it is removed). <br>
<br>
Thus, we have things as they are today, the single-target model being the ideal means of play.  Now, I agree than in many, many situations, Single-target is the best, and perhaps only way to fight somethings. However, I believe many AoE opportunities are largely underutilized.  Furthermore, I think this is true across many levels of encounter, and that the popularity of the format can only be improved by assertive players forming these groups as often as possible. That takes effort, optimism and a view to the &quot;possible&quot; not the ever-focus on the &quot;impossible.&quot;<br>
<br>
If AoE could be popularized at more levels than 53+, people would make more casters, particularly enchanters and wizards, and the overall attitudes would change--also, more of these classes would be available for pickup situations. I don't know if I see that happening because the player base is rather set in its ways now, and many people tend to be pessimistic and rather un-adventurous. However, in either case, the model continues to server me well, and is really, as Beryl pointed out, so addicitve and successful, that once tried, people are hooked and will seek you out to get more. It is hard to ignore the kind of exp AoE generates, and the excitement as well.<br>
<br>
It is a shame this was moved to RANTS.  This thread could have been a huge help and inspiration to newer players. Perhaps a thread could be started on the general boards that is stated in such a way as to seek input and help showing how AoE groups can be formed, what members/spells are needed at what levels, and what zones/mobs are good for it.<br>

I don't know what kind of efficiency ratings you are after... but one wizard was really enough to AE group from 34 to 50... back when warriors got their Ykeshas around 48th level, and there was only one plane... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

And you can't &quot;mez&quot; using AE tactics.  The AE spells break the mez.  And trying to line them up inside a dungeon could not have been an easy task.  I doubt anyone who says they used &quot;AE+Mez&quot; in fact.  Breaking the mez causes insane agro, uses too much of the enchanter's mana, and doesn't keep the MOBs stunned and not hitting people long enough (i.e. the MOBs beat downt he wizard(s) and enchanter faster than any cleric can heal because the MOBs are stunned for the 1/10th of a second they're mezmerised).<br>
<br>
At 53+ taking out 10 MOBs at a time is a joke, for comparison, for even average or mediocre AE groups. <p><font size=2>

You can doubt me as much as you want, but the fact remains... AE+Mez is viable tactic from 34th to 44th.<br>
<br>
Now, here is the explanation:<br>
<br>
Wizard starts to cast CoF.<br>
Enchanter waits a sec.<br>
Enchanter starts to cast Mezmerization.<br>
A mob00 is hit by CoF.<br>
A mob01 is hit by CoF.<br>
A mob02 is hit by CoF.<br>
A mob03 is hit by CoF.<br>
A mob00 is Mezmerized.<br>
A mob01 is Mezmerized.<br>
A mob02 is Mezmerized.<br>
A mob03 is Mezmerized.<br>
<br>
Lathe, rinse and repeat.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Breaking the mez causes insane agro, uses too much of the enchanter's mana, and doesn't keep the MOBs stunned<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
What aggro? Those mobs are unmezzed for less than a sec. How come too much mana? Circle of Force is efficient tool for 34-44 mobs. And mobs stunned... below 44th enchanters only have 2 stuns... so they wouldn't be able to stun them anyway.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I was frequently the only wizard in the bats/bugs group I mentioned, but we were only able to take 3 or 4 things at a time due to efficiency (keep in mind I wasn't twinked--had &quot;average&quot; equipment for the level).

<br>
At 45sh I pulled 8+ and 10+ mobs to our team to be AE'd away. And our team had 1 cleric, 1 warrior, 1 enchanter and 1 wizard. Enchanter tossed the colors over and over again, wizard (me) chained the Thunderclap. I wouldn't say I was twinked, I broke 200 int at level 50. But we didn't do high blues, we went for hordes of low blues.<br>
<br>
But I can't understand your reasoning damage/mob/mana isn't high enough... When using pbae, the damage per mob is the same, regardless if you have 4 mobs or 30 mobs. And 53+ taking out 10 mobs at a time... is fun. Maybe you should train your enchanter better?<br>
<br>
So... before you dismiss tactics, think them through... you know kinda out of the box thinking. And maybe some ideas and tactics, which have been used in last 20+ months are viable. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Because frankly... your post looks like you have no idea whatsoever about AE.<br>

<br>
AE+Mez is simply not the best way to approach AE.  In every case, AE+stun is better.  Stuns use less mana and they can't be &quot;broken.&quot;  They are faster casting.<br>
<br>
Every AE success I've been involved in or been told about has been with AE+stun.  And, believe me, I've tried it both ways quite extensively all through my career.  Perhaps, as you say, the run of enchanters I was able to convince to try it were just sub-par.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, I am not now, and I never was, doubting the power of AE.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I can't understand your reasoning damage/mob/mana isn't high enough&quot;<br>
<br>
216 damage / MOB / 175 mana (Circle of Force) is a damage/mob/mana ( = 1.23 d/m/m).<br>
<br>
You'll notice in previous posts that I mentioned Circle of Force, as well as Thunderclap as good pre-50 AE spells.<br>
<br>
But take, for instance, Pillar of Fire (same category as Circle of Force).  Its ratio is 0.9 d/m/m.  The point is this: if you multiply the total mana pool by the ratio, you get the damage/mob.  And on a level for level basis, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> most</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> levels (with very few exceptions) the result is low enough compared with MOB hitpoints that a wizard or two could go completely OOM on one pull of just a few MOBs.<br>
<br>
Moreover, before level 53, the absolute highest number of MOBs you can hit with any given cast is 5.  That's it.  And that's only with some PBAEs.  Circle of Force is a column spell, which targets 4 at most (column spells target at most 4 at any level--this is why you don't often hear about AE groups using Pillar of Ice {although this was my only AE spell in my first post-50 AE group}).  Use of columns requires the wizard to remove himself from the target so that he doesn't kill himself--which makes controlling aggro and positioning very difficult.<br>
<br>
To take out more than 4 or 5 at a time requires a combination of The Strategy(tm) tactics and AE.  It adds yet another level of complication to the tactic which isn't insurmountable by better-than-average players.<br>
<br>
<br>
To your example of 8+ MOBs at the 45-48 level range:<br>
<br>
Thunderclap can only hit 5 at a time (unless somehow it's <br>
been changed since three weeks ago, when I was last in an AE group).  Its ratio is 232/MOB/175 mana.  It would take <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> at least</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 5 casts of the spell to take out 5 targets (assuming it hit every target for full every time; incidentally, since this spell has a knockback component, it is frequently resisted, and is an all-or-none spell) for the average &quot;low-blue&quot; MOB at level 45.  That's a little less than 1/2 of a &quot;non twinked&quot; wizards' mana pool at level 45.  Every group of 5 beyond this requires the same contribution in mana.  So at best on one tank of mana your group could successfully take out 10 MOBs with one wizard casting, assuming one or perhaps two resists.<br>
<br>
Moreover, mezmerisation doesn't work on stunned/forced MOBs (i.e., casting mezmerise on a stunned/forced MOB will cause it to break both--if you don't believe me, have an enchanter cast Mezmerise on a MOB after you Tishan it or use, say, Thunderstrike (level 29 force spell)).  So your claim that they were never unmezzed for more than a second is quite suspect, while being entirely possible.<br>
<br>
I don't doubt you pulled this off once on a good day.  It's entirely possible.  But it's just not something that is probable.  The numbers and mechanics of the game don't lie.  The number of &quot;happy coincidences&quot; required to pull such a thing off is just too great to try and pass off such an event as a &quot;regularity.&quot;<br>
<br>
It's almost as absurd as claiming that AE tactics aren't viable.<br>
<br>
Exaggerated claims on either end don't serve anything but to cast doubt on the whole cause, which presumably is the betterment of the class.<br>
<br>
&quot;So... before you dismiss tactics, think them through... you know kinda out of the box thinking. &quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, because we all know how novel and unique a wizard suggesting AE tactics is.  Why, you're one of the few who has ever suggested it or tried it.  Almost no other wizard realises the potential of AE spells.  Thank you so much for enlightening the rest of us.  <p><font size=2>

That's the thickest bullshit I've heard in long while.<br>
<br>
My personal record with Thunderclap (level <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  34</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> spell) is 13 mobs.<br>
My personal record with Supernova (level <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  49</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> spell) is 28 mobs.<br>
My enchanter friend hit 31 mobs with his 44th level stun when I hit my 28 mobs... he was next to me and thus in a tad bit better place.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately we didn't have serverside filters, etc. things to improve our performance... and we got killed by LAG. Enchanter just couldn't cast 2nd stun because the EQ-client was lagging so bad. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  BUT... we had tons of fun... and we learned that while we can't survive pull of 31+ (some mobs didn't follow all the way to room), we could easily survive pulls of 25... and those were fun (and fast for cash hunting).<br>
<br>
Oh... and that testing we had... it was in Mistmoore, just behind drawbridge. We used 2 clerics to pull that horde to us. And... for the record (if there is archives, you find it there too) this happened <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  before</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Kunark, so <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  no-one</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> was 53rd level.<br>

Nah... not very difficult. (This coming from guy that practised AE for over 8 months, so I admit, it could be challenging). At 51sh we did imps and efreeti in SolB with group of 4 using pulls of 4 imps at a time and the fabled AE+MEZ tactic. Worked like a charm.<br>

You just have positioning problem. Use TC's knockback effect to put mobs in corner, and voilá, you can hit way more than 5 mobs. PBAE spells don't have limitation, except the range, I still believe that if you can stuff 100 mobs in the range, you would hit them all with PBAE... no one has proved otherwise yet.<br>
<br>
And to TC being resisted... well... that's why normal 45sh wizard has mana to cast 8 of them... first 6 kill most and rest 2 finish the remaining... or if there was only couple remaining, you can always use CoF or DD... depending on situation. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Remember</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that when you have chained ALL your mana to TC, your enchanter has wasted only about 35% of his mana.<br>

Did you try it with Circle of Force? You know, the 34th level pillar-type spell? Or with Pillar of Frost, the 51st level pillar spell... I know I have done it tons of times with both, and with huge success. I can't say I have ever tested it with Tishan or Thunderstrike, so the stun ending -&gt; breaking mez can very well be true... but that doesn't hinder this tactic at all. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

How did we manage to pull these off regularily between 34 and 50? Why did I cast more AE spells than DD spells between those levels? The numbers and mechanics don't lie, that's true. But your lies about TC being limited to 5 mobs is one thing that hinders your conclusions, other is the assumption that you can't mez after CoF.<br>
<br>
There is no happy coincidences to pull these things off... we VERY rarely had even a such a bad string of resists that we were forced to evac. Especially because Mezmerization hit unlimited count of mobs back in those good old days... so when things started to go downhill, the &quot;quick-mez-em-all&quot; was possible.<br>

Wizard suggesting AE isn't unique or novel, it might've been that couple of years ago, but not anymore. But I haven't exaggerated at all, I only post my personal experiences from in-game, not some paper+pen calculations how it could be done. I've been posting same posts since August 1999, that's when I hit 34th level. If the 21 months of testing and should I say... pioneering AE haven't taught me how they work, I'm surprised.<br>

<br>
Here is an old info-bit, that Grimstaff may remember, but most may not know: when I played the game actively, the first 14 months that I played, I played from same room IRL as my cleric, enchanter and warrior friends. We grouped exclusively with each other, sometimes adding friends if someone wanted to join us. We also played at EET timezone (PST+10), so LGuk/SolB/etc were basicly empty. Some of our successes from pre-Kunark (and with couple or no planar level items) include: Estrella, FGs and Efreeti with our group of 4.<br>
<br>
So yes... our group played together possibly somewhat better than your average pick-up group, but that does not hinder the tactics invalid. I think it just shows what can be done, if people set their minds to it.<br>

No, the stuns don't totally overlap and the enchanter tends to get beat up, but that's what the healer is there for.  I did it, I know you can.  Its scary as heck for the enchanter and a nasty string of resists results in a total wipeout.  But it works fine, everything has risks.<br>
<br>
Heck I am trying to convince people now that they can use PBAE without the stuns on lower numbers at level 16 or so.  I know cause I did it and work with guys that do it now with my lower level characters.  It really is surprising what you can pull off with enough determination, luck, and creativity.  Wizards tend to excel at this because our tools are limited and we have to push the envelope.  That and Wizards are the master seekers of knowledge, Verant's changes notwithstanding.<br>
