The SGA was formed to allow smaller guilds to go and do things that individual guilds our size could not do. Sadly, in my mind the SGA in its current configuration is not able to accomplish raids that require alot of planning and coordination on a regular basis. Because of that I feel all of our guilds are losing high level members.<br><br>Please note, I am certainly not knocking anyones efforts. Alot of people have been putting a great deal into the SGA, but because of the game mechanics it make it very difficult. Also, the lack of a structured organization makes planning even more difficult.<br><br>Now I am not going to point out the short commings without offering my idea on how to help correct these matters  <br><br>Boofa's Proposition<br><br>I will create a new guild. The purpose of this guild would be for the sole purpose of SGA raids. At the time of an SGA event, you would drop your individual guild tag, and join the SGA guild. At the conclusion of the event you would then drop the SGA guild tag and go back to your guild.I understand that this creates alot of hassles for officers getting people tagged, but if each guild places a mule officer at various port locations, it should not be to bad.<br><br>The next step in the plan would to make the SGA much more organized. Currently a person post an event and in essence hopes people will show up. This is fine with events that do not require many people or does not require much planning. The problem comes up when you are planning a large and complicated even such as a plane raid. <br><br>Example.<br><br>Fear raid is planned at 9pm est on a Friday night.<br><br>-9:00 pm comes and there is about 15 people waiting at the portal. Many tells come in from people saying that they are on thier way. <br><br>9:10 Raid leader starts to form groups but since they keep getting tells from other people comming they have to constantly reform groups (If you have never formed groups on a large raid, it is not easy and requires alot of time)<br><br>9:45 Raid leader still getting tells from people asking if there is a raid, and start comming to join it. Raid leader still trying to form groups. Communication is starting to become a problem because people are getting bored and are sending out shouts and goofing off in ooc.<br><br>10:20 Groups are formed, Raid leader still getting tells from people saying they just got on and if they can come. Raid leader finally says no and raid starts. At this point people have been waiting for around an hour and a half and are antsy to get going. People notice that they dont have much more time to play and try to rush forward without listening to the raid leader.<br><br>With the SGA I would not allow things like this to happen. <br><br>First- The raid will be posted with full details of what is to be acomplished, what resorces will be needed, our plans on how to accomplish it, loot rules, and what time event will start.<br><br>Second- Everyone that wants to attend either post on the message board or contact the raid leader at least one day prior to the raid. If you want to bring a friend along then you must also advise the raid leader of this as well.<br><br>Third- The raid post will be updated by the raid leader to show current group configurations prior to the night of the event. Also, any changes in the original plans will be posted the morning of the event. EVERYONE participating in the event, must check the bb to find out the latest information on the raid, who the group leaders will be, and whos group they are in.<br><br>Forth- Everyone MUST BE ON TIME if they want to attend the event or you will not be going. I feel if we are to be sucessful, we must be able to start an event at a given time. We are going to start to find out that if we do not, some other guild will beat us to our hunt. I realize that RL things come up, if so that is fine, just catch the next event. I only see missing events that you are signed up for being a problem if the person constantly does it.<br><br>Fifth- Everyone will listen to the raid leaders. If a person does not, they will be reported on to myself (or another desinated person). If that person continues to cause problems, they will not be invited to other events.<br><br>Sixth- After the event, people will be encouraged to come back to the original event post and post their thoughts on how the event went.<br><br><br>So this kinda out lines my plans on raids.<br><br>Another thing I would want to have happen is a member list from each guild of who wishes to be active in the SGA. I would want their class, level, and play times. I do not want to get a list from a guilds GM showing everyone in the guild. I only want a list of who really wants to activly participate and should also be mostly higer level people.<br><br>I am not trying to leave lower level people out of this; however, our guilds on their own can normally take care of the needs of the pre 50 level ranges. The SGA is for higher level events and zones that individual guilds in the SGA can not accomplish on thier own.<br><br>I would like our core members to be able to organize very quickly should the need arrise. In this I mean if you are a core member and should the named turtle (sorry can not remember his name) should pop we could count on you to drop what you are currently doing (provided you are not in one of your guild events) and rapidly join up with a SGA raid team. I realize this would take some work, but I would really like to see this happen at some point.<br><br><br>Well there you have Boofa's ideas on what can be done for the SGA. Like I said before, I am not knocking any ones efforts at all. But at the same time, I only see things getting harder and harder if we do not take some dramatic steps now.<br><br>Please let me know what you all think.<br><br>Boofa Bearfang<br>Elder Shaman of Amnesty (55 now WHAHOOOO)<br>Founding member of the SGA<br><br><br>PS: Sorry for any spelling or grammer problems that may be here.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uzalliben.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zalliben</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(9/7/01 6:39:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=283.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Boofa's thoughts on the SGA</span><hr size=1> This is a fantastic idea. I know I'm in a guild that left the SGA, but this idea is too good to not comment on.<br><br>Some additional ideas:<br><br>PL A Druid/Wizard to the level where they can port to all zones (and get them all the teeth/keys they need) and give them the GL tag. This will make it easy to invite the officers neccessary to do the invites.<br><br>GL's would be responsible for handing off their GL tag to a trusted member when they are on raids.<br><br>This idea has been kicked around for a long time in various forms and solves the biggest problem with SGA raids. Communication once there has been a whipeout. Whipeouts happen and having the common chat channel helps a lot.<br><br>I would also suggest that maybe Boofa would want to lead the SGA. He was a great GL in Amnesty and is probably the only original member from the original alliance still in the SGA. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvainne.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vainne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(9/7/01 6:43:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=283.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http--braggarts.shareplay.com-pics-Wythe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Boofa's thoughts on the SGA</span><hr size=1> I think it's brilliant Boo--<br><br>Regarding the implementation of it, I would love to help in any way I can.<br><br>Raids I doubt I can lead--member lists, I think I can organize.<br><br> <p><b>Vainne K'harmicdeva<br> ~The Nightblind Bard~<b>~Amnesty, Saryrn~<br>Wythe, bard of Bristlebane, Sullon Zek</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujarreriverleaf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jarre Riverleaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(9/7/01 7:17:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=283.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Forgive the rant.... its been building a while.</span><hr size=1> I agree with you boofa.

The actual implementation will be kind of tricky it seems.  <br><br>1)  Would one rep from each participating guild be given an officer tag so that they could manage the invitation of the others in their guild?  If so, the same person would likely not attend each event, so that would have to be assigned dynamically for each individual event, and probably arranged on the boards prior.<br><br>2)  To minimize the organizational nightmare this would cause for re-forming of guilds, guild officers would (as you said) need to be placed at numerous locations around the world.  It would probably be beneficial to identify the common raid locations (Hate, Fear, Kael, Kedge, wherever...) and have every guild place mule officers at those pre-designated places (SRo spires, Feerot portal, etc.).  However, the mule officers would have to be on multiple people's accounts, since you have to accomodate for the GL not being able to attend every event.  As long as the events SGA runs were set out with a good amount of time in advance, this should not be a problem.  <br><br>3)  What would be ideal would be for each guild to have an extra account for SGA purposes, and have a character on that account as an SGA officer.  Each active SGA player would have access to their guild's account, and that way it would not matter who is attending.  One person would log on the other account and pass out the memberships.  The problem with that would be lack of accountability, so it probably would not work.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Anyway Boofa, I applaud your active interest in improving the state of things, and I thank everyone who is making a strong effort to accomplish the vision of the SGA.<br><br>Dehglor Valorcry<br>50th season Paladin<br>Wings of the Chimera <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bsaryrnguildallianceboard.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=goishen>Goishen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(9/7/01 9:27:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=283.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Boofa's thoughts on the SGA</span><hr size=1> <br><br>Well, myself, I thought that this was kind'a how SGA was.  I thought that the 1 diplomat was pemanently tagged and an officer, so that he or she could invite all of his guild members.  <br><br>But then again, we are just looking for membership.  <br><br>Also, I thought that there would be 1 raid leader, 1 or 2 helpers.   <br><br>And, have the 1 diplomat say to all of his or her respective guild members, deguild yourselves, and prepare to be reguilded.  We could do this during the &quot;work up period for groups&quot;.   <br><br>Also, about the diplomat, I think that it should be the most active person in the guild.  One who doesn't go on vacations, is home every night,  and on the game (I know that this is a stretch for some of you, but ppl do it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).   Also, I think that if the diplomat doesn't post to the board that they wanna go, the raid leader can hold whatever phat lewts he wants to back from them.  (IE, making the diplomat position much more important.)  May sound like I'm being a prick, but I want ppl to start taking this guild seriously, even if we don't become members.  This way you'll become more cohesive.

This could be placed on either a second account (many people currently have them) or a secondary charactor on your primary account.  <br><br>Invites into the SGA guild would be very simple to obtain at the raid itself if need be. Invites back into your guild should not be too difficult if you have officer mules that can port in your guild (I currently have a 24 druid that is tagged an officer in Amnesty). I would ask that each guild makes their own plans on how to handle their retagging after a raid, but I would not think it would be to difficult.<br><br>I am not disagreeing that this will be trouble free, however, I do feel the benifits will out weight the problems.<br><br><br>Goishen,<br><br>Currently we do not have an actual guild setup for the SGA.

If you are comming to the SGA for phat loot, you would probably be better served in a large guild (not trying to talk you out of the SGA). Now I do want to see the SGA becoming more of a force than we currently are, and better items for our members certainly wont hurt in that effort <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br> <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bsaryrnguildallianceboard.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=boofa>Boofa</A> at: 9/7/01 10:01:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udruskurdrom.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drusk Urdrom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(9/7/01 10:13:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=283.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tardiness</span><hr size=1> I would like to say one thing about tardiness.

Would not be a problem for us.<br><br>And my thought on SGA is that it should serve 2 purposes: 1) to go to new places that require multiple uber groups and 2) to do epics for allied members. <p>Drusk Urdrom, 50 Cleric<br>Belash, 31 Rogue<br>Tiem, 23 Wizard<br>Eternal Knights of VeliousSaryrn Server</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ulaotse.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Laotse</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(9/7/01 10:27:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=283.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tardiness</span><hr size=1> This is a fantastic idea.

I would like to see us not takeing people who are late.  Yeah it sucks for that person... but the events are posted on these boards... people should not be in the dark about what's going on.  <br><br>For the flipside of this, I would also like to see a secondary stageing time happen for our planar raids.  Have the designated start time, if your late you can't go up then.  Groups will not be reformed and you won't be able to join at that time.  BUT, say 2 or 3 hours later... Raid has been going good, some people might need to be leaveing and others might have gotton off work and would like to have gone up at the start time but weren't able to.  Have this be the second staging time.  A time that was laid out before hand in the initial raid planning on the boards.  So that everyone will know when this is as well and the same rules will aply, Tardiness not being accepted.<br><br>Send in the subs.

However, I don't think an epic is anyone's god given right...and I predict some issues will arise with competition and who gets what when--we probably want to see if there are some measures we can put in place to combat this.

I myself, when I show up late I just don't go to the raid *shrug* unless its a plane raid or something usually if i'm patient they'll get a spot for me when they're ready but other then that, showing up on time is important, try to do what you can to make sure you'll be there on time. <p><B><I>Gharbad "The Mighty" Champion Of Amnesty</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=283.topic&start=21&stop=30>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showPrevMessage?topicID=283.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showNextMessage?topicID=283.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=283.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.emailToFriend?topicID=283.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.threadControl?topicID=283.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/slate/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=283.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=283.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm1">General Discussion<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm8">Guild Links<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm4">Alliance Events<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm2">Guild Member Introductions<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm5">Alliance Marketplace<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm7">Officer forum<option value="saryrnguildallianceboardfrm6">Guild Leader discussions</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#FFFF00>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bsaryrnguildallianceboard>saryrnguildallianceboard</a><font color=#FFFF00> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1>General Discussion</a> <font color=#FFFF00> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><form method="post" action="http://affiliates.allposters.com/link/redirect.asp" target="_top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" bgcolor="#CC3333"><tr><td><img src="http://images.allposters.com/images/banners/searchbox1_left.gif" WIDTH="58" HEIGHT="65" border="0"></td><td align="left" valign="top"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td colspan="2"><img src="http://images.allposters.com/images/banners/searchbox1_center.gif" WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="40" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><input type="text" name="associatesearch" size="9"><input type="hidden" name="aid" value="147977"></td><td valign="center"><input type="image" src="http://images.allposters.com/images/banners/searchbox1_right.gif" WIDTH="60" HEIGHT="25" border="0"></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></form></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href=http://www.onresponse.com/onR_Ads.asp?a=25001&d=5728>Do your taxes for FREE with TaxACT!
