You can say this about a lot of things.  For almost any issue, you can find people who are willing to fight for it.<br>

Eating meat, animal testing, birth control, abortion, etc.  There are even people who are offended by the idea of using any modern medicine.<br>

There are armies worth of people IN the Us who are jealous of the wealthies one percent of the population, or the most intelligent one percent of the population.<br>

I don't know how you can assume that genetic engineering will lead to war more than all of these other jealousies will. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=liquid>Liquid</A> at: 4/2/02 12:59:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uwhizbangdustyboots.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Whizbang Dustyboots</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Gnomish Advocate</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/02 12:58:06 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.lby3.com/eq/whiz/flappy.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OT:  Cloning</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> And Whizbang, test tube babies are normal human beings.

How about the person who has twice the education of you, a car more expensive than you live, a house more expensive than one you'll ever even WALK PAST, and got all of that because they have a rich daddy? Given all the benefits this can give them -- real life twinking -- you have a life that they'd piss on, or might well commit suicide rather than live.<br>
<br>
And yet no one has sacked Beverly Hills yet, or put the Hamptons to the torch. Inequities are a fact of life, and even the assumed inequities here -- there will be normal people and superhuman people, something that's a little unlikely to occur that unevenly -- aren't any worse than the gap between the richest and poorest in America today, where the gap is relatively small compared to the rest of the world.<br>

One thing you failed to mention is that we're not talking about a concept here.  We're talking about actual beings that you can interact with.  Being against a concept has caused war in the past.  Being against a whole set of engineered beings WILL cause war because it creates an obvious line between the engineered people and the ones who aren't.  It's inevitable, whereas with a concept, people can argue, and their actions aren't constantly IN YOUR FACE.  A genetically engineered being WILL be constantly in your face, that's enough to cause bad things to happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ufaithkills.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faithkills</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/02 1:00:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Answer</span><hr size=1> &quot;Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.&quot; - WBDB<br>

WBDB is right on the money. The rich are better nourished, better educated, get better health care, go to rich scholls where they gain contacts with other rich people, so they are ensured of getting a nice powerful rich job.<br>
<br>
The classes ARE divided, geneering and cloning won't change this for the better, but if you try to restrict it it WILL CHANGE IT FOR THE WORSE. If you make it illegal the technology will only be available to the rich.<br>
<br>
&quot;Mark my words, genetic engineering will bring about the end of human life (if we just stand by and watch). This is to say, human life being those naturally bred, and inhuman life being the genetically engineered (they are inhuman in that they have a jumble of enhanced characteristics that aren't present in their parents, if that doesn't make them inhuman, I don't know what does).&quot; - Nyargle<br>

Because I think that &quot;bugs&quot; will exist, and I think that flawed humans WILL be inadvertently created... and I have concerns as to how this &quot;problem&quot; will be solved.<br>
<br>
I believe that some flawed humans will be destroyed by unethical researchers (hell it's happening with abortions right now eh?). I have issue with that.<br>
<br>
I believe some flawed humans will be allowed to live, I have issues with where the money comes from to support them.<br>

All of this causes issues and problems we are introducing upon ourselves... something that can and IMO, should be avoided.<br>

Absolutely not.  I never said that.  I said that the engineered beings CAN and WILL take control of those less fortunate than them, either by destroying them because they are useless, or by enslaving them.  The only way to prevent this is to put up a fight, isn't it?  Or do you have a better solution?<br>

<br>
Selective breeding is the same thing as natural breeding in humans.  People choose mates they find appealing, and deep down it's partly because they want their kids to be well off.  Using sperm to become pregnant is natural.  Choosing a father for the baby is not the same as making something superior by genetically modifying it.  Call them both genetics if you want to, and maybe you're right, but despite that word, they are still different. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/unyargle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nyargle</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/2/02 1:14:07 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uthediscoinferno.showPublicProfile?language=EN>The DiscoInferno</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/02 1:09:27 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.cdc.net/~mjunky/temp/mage.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OT:  Cloning</span><hr size=1> The &quot;bugs&quot; with current mamallian clones, i.e. short life spans are becuase of shortened tolemer lengths, knowing the problem is the first step towards finding a solution. <br>

When you are sitting there thinking &quot;it will never happen&quot;, there are people out there thinking &quot;this is gonna be great&quot;.<br>
<br>
I don't believe I can ever get you people to see what I think, let alone agree with me.  But it doesn't matter anyway.  What will happen, will happen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=liquid>Liquid</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/02 1:13:32 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: OT:  Cloning</span><hr size=1> Quote:<br>

Being against a whole set of engineered beings WILL cause war because it creates an obvious line between the engineered people and the ones who aren't. It's inevitable, whereas with a concept, people can argue, and their actions aren't constantly IN YOUR FACE. A genetically engineered being WILL be constantly in your face, that's enough to cause bad things to happen.<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
The things I mentioned are more than concepts, they are actions.  People who believe that cows are sentient see everyone that is eating beef as &quot;constantly in their face.&quot;  People who are poor could see people who are rich as &quot;constantly in their face.&quot;  People who are pro-life see those who have abortions as &quot;constantly in their face.&quot;<br>
<br>
There are MANY, hard-lined divisions that exist in the world.  Very few of them ever lead to war.  And the ones that did usually resulted from a lack of understanding, not from a real conflict. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uevantineessidel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Evantine Essidel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://evantine.homestead.com/files/Eventine.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/02 1:14:40 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cloning</span><hr size=1> Once upon a time, it was wrong and against the law to own a telescope.

That's not to say it can't be used for evil intent. Look at how Hitler warped Darwin's theories into justifying racial cleansing.

Again, something different here.  Except maybe the rich thing, and that's unrelated, as wealth doesn't define an individual at all.  If a pro-life person was FORCED to WITNESS an abortion, that would be in their face.  Seeing somebody who has abortions regularly isn't the same thing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eaminwhitefalcon>Eamin Whitefalcon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>¡Viva la inquisición!</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/2/02 1:19:23 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://web.tampabay.rr.com/eqsite/Eamin_small.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Answer</span><hr size=1> Getting rid of defects will NOT make perfect people. Without defects, there are still people who are stronger, weaker, smarter, stupider, faster, slower, more charming, uglier, etc.<br>
But destroying defection will let the real human shine through, instead of the disease. That's why I support this form of genetic engineering.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, a world where babies are designed according to their parents' wims, a world where babies of the rich are actually BETTER than the babies of the poor, not just better educated and better nourished, is not a nice, happy world. Advances in technology are slowly but surely diminishing the amount of the world's population that lives in poverty. Would you throw a huge wrench into this, creating a whole new caste division, not between rich and poor but between human and superhuman?<br>
<br>
I wouldn't. <p><center>

That race is our (read yours and mine) children and just because they don't have all of my genes doesn't mean that they are superhuman. <br>
<br>
Superhuman by definition means that someone is better than a human. Seeing as what most people have been talking about is people with no genetic defects (or custom colored eyes or hair or what ever other superficial characteristic you wish to modify) I don't see how this is superhuman. My eyes are Hazel but say I wanted a child with blue eyes. Just because I did not provide the DNA for blue eyes doesn't mean that its not possible for a human to have them. It is possible for people to be born without a genetic defect therefor eliminating defects prior to their manifestation is also within the realm of Human and not Superhuman.<br>
<br>
Genetic engineering can basically thought of as maximizing your child's potential and I don't know a parent who does not think this is a good thing. Some would say this is too far, I'll leave that to the individual to decide though and not the government or the UN.<br>
<br>
The human race has been creating Caste systems, Strict social structures and class systems which do suck for the people in the lower levels. Engineering &quot;better&quot; people only changes why you are in the lower levels not the fact that you are there. It won't even change the position you are born in. If your parents are rich you'll have these advantages. If your parents are poor you won't. No change in status quo.<br>
<br>
This won't change the fact that rich kids get nice little pieces of paper from Ivy league schools which grant them high paying jobs and opens doors for them. What it might do is make the kid intelligent enough that they keep the job due to their qualifications and not their cash.<br>
<br>
<br>

Please pardon me if this didn't flow well. I suck at writing due to a poor public education....... and I didn't like school =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a> <b>5</b> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=161&stop=180>9</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=181&stop=200>10</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=201&stop=220>11</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=221&stop=240>12</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=241&stop=260>13</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=261&stop=280>14</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=281&stop=300>15</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=301&stop=320>16</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=321&stop=340>17</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=341&stop=360>18</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=361&stop=380>19</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=381&stop=400>20</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=401&stop=420>21</a><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessageRange?topicID=1027.topic&start=421&stop=427>22</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showPrevMessage?topicID=1027.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showNextMessage?topicID=1027.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=1027.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=1027.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1027.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1027.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four -
