<br>
The fact that you believe splurt is godly pvp wise, insta owns int casters, and saves vs poison simply servers to illustrate the fact that you are either not much of a pvper or a lowbie.<br>
<br>
As an int caster the proper way to go about it is to stack your buffs in such a way that there are as many open spots as you can conviently maintain at the top of your buff stack.  This allows you to dispell as needed.  All pumicable dots should do little or no damage to you unless you are running for your life and can't stop to dispell.  Splurt especially if you get it off pretty fast since it does almost no dmg at the start and increases with each tick.<br>
<br>
I bit of a suggestion fyi.  If you see any disc msg I would suggest you back off and kite till it wears off. No rogue disc lasts over 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
As far as the deadeye disc I hate to tell you bud but if I start whacking you 2 seconds into the spell and do 100 dps for 4 seconds that wont be enough to break through epic (or spell)skin before the MB hits.  Note MB is classified as a lvl 1 spell (check the spdat) and as such is easy to channel.  Gonna get easier with the caster focus items going in too.<br>
<br>
I will say this again, neither full raid buffs nor compatriots can be used to justify MB.  If you want to examine class balance you must look at realistic situations.  1 on 1 pvp balance is just that 1 on 1.  You are not suitably balanced because you can't kill 3 people at once or mannaburn a fully buffed n tov equiped char k? To claim so is absurd.<br>
<br>
As far as looking at chars with similar AA points.  Guess what. No skill I can get even with 200 AA points will do anything to protect me from MB.  It will still kill me.  In addition no amount of AAs will give me something like MB and don't give me that crap about duelist.  People don't all bag their gear when a duelist rogue enters the zone. It's not half as good as you seem to think.  The pvp gain from AAs for a rogue is minimal, a fractional increase in dmg, the ability to do a single minimum bs from the front, and a few nifty 72 minute refresh skills that don't make much difference pvp wise. The gain for a wizard is huge.<br>
<br>
With sufficent AAs a wiz can increase their dmg substantially, cast somewhat faster, use 2 different 1/10th of a second gates every 72 minutes, and nuke once every 2 or so hours for 4-6k pvp dmg.<br>
<br>
Basicly what you've got is a class that is nearly impossible to kill and gets a free kill shot every 2 hours via a ridiculously overpowered skill.  This will get worse with focus items.<br>
Thats balance? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umakyz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Makyz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/8/02 8:14:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Whats the purpose of the 66% nerf</span><hr size=1> necros get lifeburn why dont you whine about that some rogueling?(sp?) <p>Makyz-58 Evoker <BR>

<br>
If you had taken time to read my post, you would notice the questioning part. But alas, you assumed what I said and twisted it into a statement of fact (for future reference, question marks means unknowing or unsure). Also where have I ever said splurt was godly? I simply made a statement about the amount of damage splurt can do ONCE before (and I never claimed it was godly, merely used it as a reference for spells that can kill in one casting). Yet again you assume and insert any word that comes from your limited grasp of what I posted. And as a final rebut against your childish statement, note the part that says &quot;ON A SIDE NOTE&quot;, followed shortly thereafter with &quot;THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MB&quot;. <br>
<br>
<br>

Splurt especially if you get it off pretty fast since it does almost no dmg at the start and increases with each tick.&quot;--<br>
<br>
As a wizard I can name all my buffs on almost one hand almost. See Inv, Skin spell, element buff (wiz buff is one spell only), levitate, manaskin (if high enough), and resist (again one spell), and shield spell (arch, magi, whichever you are using). Well losing see inv hurts when against rogues and inv casting classes, losing shield spell costs mana and hp (about a bub of each at higher levels), losing element buff or resist makes all spells affect me better (these are 30 pt resist buffs at 50+). Losing skin or manaskin means I lose all protection and go down to my less than 1.3k hit points at higher levels (using a broad number that is probably higher then actual). That leaves levitate as my only junk spell really, and it is quite handy and therefor not totally useless or junk depending on where I am fighting. Well there is my dmg shield spell that is useless... Familiars are a joke since the are melee targetable by PvPers (and it takes a lot of mana to summon one, not to mention fizzle rate).<br>
<br>
<br>
--&quot;I bit of a suggestion fyi. If you see any disc msg I would suggest you back off and kite till it wears off. No rogue disc lasts over 15 seconds.&quot;--<br>
<br>
FYI for you now. When you have a skin spell on, all hit messages are doubled (i.e one hit gets you 2 lines of text saying &quot;you have been hit--your skin has absorbed it&quot;, one after the other). Now combine that with dual attack and double attacks at a ridiculous haste level and the casting of pumice, golem wand or whatever you use to try to strip enchantments off right away. Can't imagine that spamming by...<br>
<br>
--&quot;As far as the deadeye disc I hate to tell you bud but if I start whacking you 2 seconds into the spell and do 100 dps for 4 seconds that wont be enough to break through epic (or spell)skin before the MB hits.

Pure utter crap. Yes it will disrupt, not ALL the time, but MOST of the time. If it flat out didn't kill with a good crit or BS tossed in.<br>
<br>
<br>
--&quot;I will say this again, neither full raid buffs nor compatriots can be used to justify MB.

<br>
Learn to read yet again. Never said it was required. Never claimed it. Said most 52+ people have buffs on at all times more or less. Your class PvP examples always have the wizard with the &quot;jump&quot; on rogue. I present the reverse to the destruction of the wiz. And you can do it (duelist) 4 more times BEFORE manaburn refreshes. In fact I never claimed duelist was unbalanced, or any rogue ability for that matter.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of your post, it has been dealt with in previous posts. Try &quot;Hooked on Phonics&quot;, a dictionary and a text on the defintition of a question mark. Preferably before insulting your own intelligence.<br>

Balanced you say?  PFFT<br>
<br>
Manaburn out of the picture, about melee versus spells.  The problem is that melee is 'unresistable' for casters, while spells with the exceptions of lures are easily resistable.  While melee saves versus AC, spells save versus resists, with average gear for a level 60, full buffs I can break 800 ac, and that's with shissar/coe, and even that's absolutely useless versus a high level melee.  What I think needs to exist to balance out melee/caster pvp at the high end (which is totally skewed towards melee) is that caster AC needs to actually make a very significant impact on melee damage.  It is currently impossible for any caster to raise his AC to a point where it even makes a difference in pvp, while any joe schmoe, with 10 k investment can buy a full set of BD/Diamond gear and laugh at all regular spells.  I think it would add an element of tactic if before going into a battle, a wizard would have to choose whether to wear hp gear to combact lures, resist gear, or ac gear.<br>
<br>
At level 60, a rogue will land most hits for maximum against a wizard, simply because a wizards ac is A LOT lower than the mobs a level 60 rogue fights as a baseline, so his damage distribution is extremly skewed up, making it so that moving from 600 to 800 AC would hamper a melee's damage output as much as going from 25 to 120 to all resists is IMHO exactly what's needed for pvp, not stupid insta kill skills. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/24/02 8:28:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=95>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At least I can read a question statement correctly....</span><hr size=1> Food plz Mearis <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uvelaelsoulrender.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Velael Soulrender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/24/02 4:14:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.mmogamers.com/hate/ikonboard/avatars/joe.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: At least I can read a question statement correctly....</span><hr size=1> Fyvish (60 Primal Rogue) killed Cappadonna (60 epic wizard) within the casting time of Manaburn. /disc Duelist ... fully hasted that's 2 double BS rounds + God knows how much melee damage.<br>

<br>
Sorry melee dmg isn't so simple unfortunately. If most hits were really for max and few missed as is in fact the case with say lvl 20 orc centurions in EC then a rogue would do obscene dmg.  In reality casters aren't that much better nor worse off as far as mitigation and avoidance than velks spiders (45-48 about) While your AC may be lower your also a lot higher lvl.  In reality unbuffed bsing all the time I probably wouldn't do more than 70dps average vs the spiders. Keep in mind the normal figures you see for rogues are buffed as we do NOT solo worth shit.   Hitting most hits for max would put me between 200 and 300 dps a figure I'm quite sure I never achieve.  I will gladly verify this fact with you next time we raid together.<br>
<br>
I've found personally that there is also btw a definate difference between naked caster ac and geared caster ac too. Naked casters go down FAST.<br>
<br>
Also before I would care one bit about any issue mages may have there are a few ummm strategies you can use vs pure melee.<br>
<br>
Pet kiting. Run around in a circle while your pet does the dmg for ya. Casting optional.  Since the pure melee can't channel through pet dmg if the pet has expedience the melee can't debuff the pet.  If the caster just runs away the pet WILL kill the melee or force him to run.<br>
<br>
DS.  Use a DS potion AND your own ds then prevent normal dispelling with the simple trick of clicking to insta items.  Your own ds is actually suffiecent here if you don't want to waste the money.  Without wands the melee has as good as lost espcially if as a rogue they must duel wield.<br>
<br>
Levitate and block dispelling as above. Without wands you can't lose.  If your wanded run away and come back releved.<br>
<br>
<br>
LoS exploiting.  Made especially easy via /pet attack /assist<br>
<br>
Ghosting.  Do the circle jerk up and down hills till you ghost then cast at will.<br>
<br>
I would counter your ascertion that mages are unbalanced vs pure melee because you have no lures as wizards do with the fact that I and the other pure melee classes can't simply root your pet as hybrids do and its basicly an unresistable dot for the duration of the fight.  Made especially nasty if you choose not to fight much and let your pet carry the fight.  Whether you enjoy using all or none of the strategies above if they aren't adressed they ARE available to you and if not to you to more unscrupulous members of your class.  Balance must be based on what people can do not what nice people like yourself do.<br>
<br>
If you counter that pet kiting makes melees run I would say you should stop to cast enough that they think they have a chance but not enough to lose the fight.  Have fun.<br>
<br>
I would maintain basicly that vs a pure melee mages are perfectly viable in a real pvp environment and that rogue dmg is not in need of being situationally lowered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umearisthecowslayer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mearis The Cowslayer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/29/02 6:12:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: In reply to Mearis</span><hr size=1> Aerimus, I am talking about in dungeon pvp, not outdoor pvp where melees take a huge disadvantage... also remember mages do not get absecond/shadowstep, so if you choose to use pumace I have no choice but to run, I cannot shadowstep and refresh skin like a wizard can, and if wish to root the pet just get some wooly silken nets, or dispell the sow from it and just ignore it...<br>

<br>
BTW as a 60 sorcerer with Aego, Kodiacs, Focus items, junk buffs etc..I was Golemed, wacked a couple of times, and HT to death in UNDER 6 secs...so as far as your &quot;balance&quot; arguements are concerned <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Guess balance &quot;all depends' on many factors.  One thing for sure, without manaburn, I had a 0% chance of killing this SK in closed quarters.  Basically any melee with a golem rod is going to take me down QUICKLY in enclosed quarters...this is balance friend ? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/02 3:20:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=23.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Manaburn NOT nerfed after all ?</span><hr size=1> First off all classes aren't sk and the answer to sks isn't to balance all classes around them.<br>
<br>
Next if golem wands are so uber then thats an arguement for nerfing wands not an argument for giving casters full dmg or a DT.  However other issues would have to be adressed before that could be done.<br>
<br>
Next I wouldn't suggest that  a wizard fight a rogue in close quarters...anymore than I would suggest a rogue fight a wizard in gd.   Either fight is a losing battle for the class at a disadvantage.<br>
<br>
About getting jumped and wasted.  I recommend you get one of the 2 aa insta gates if your high enough.  If the fights not to your advantage gate and look for a way to fight the person in question thats more to your liking.<br>
