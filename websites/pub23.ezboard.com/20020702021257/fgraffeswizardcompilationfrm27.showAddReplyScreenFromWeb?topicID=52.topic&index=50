The lvl 60 lure has longer cast time and is harder to channel.<br>
<br>
Almost fogot the main topic of this thread.<br>
Wizard vs rogue in pvp seems to me to be fairly balanced, maybe a bit of an advantage to the rogue. This advantage gets pretty huge with duelist that gives the chance of oneshot kills. The reset time on duelist isnt much longer then the rebuff and med to full time for a wizard either. <br>
Then add manaburn that gives wizards oneshot kills of rogues. This with a much longer reset time, ie 3 duelist attempts for each manaburn attempt. The question then is if wizard manaburn is more unbalanced then rogue duelist? And if rogue with duelist is more unbalanced against wizard without manaburn?<br>
<br>
I personaly think that if they take the time to disable manaburn for pvp then any other equaly unbalanced abbilities should be disabled (duelist, trueshot etc). I havent seen any real arguments against this. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A> at: 3/28/02 6:40:14 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/upickkpockket999.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pickk Pockket999</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/28/02 6:52:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Logs and dps</span><hr size=1> Just want to add that at 53 most rogues will have around 1600hp unbuffed.

1941 HPs but I figure maybe a bit lower with some HP stuff swapped with resist stuff or whatever. Remeber this is RZ so if you got some super duper piece of gear you are risking wearing it.<br>

Remember that RZ is the only one of the 4 pvp servers with itemloot. On all others can you wear anything you want without risk. Making it easier to get both resists and hp. When I talk about pvp in general, asume its about the 3/4th of the servers without itemloot. Still, you got more hp then 1850...<br>

-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
I have seen several single BS hits of well over 1000, so getting 2k damage (incl one round of melee) isnt any big deal. I actualy put average at about 1500 so your 1300 isnt far off anyway. Arimus put it at 600 or something, and thats not very close. From safehouse I got that minimum backstab with duelist is somewhere around 566. So 1300 is about the minimum that can be gotten incl one round of melee. And you will generaly not hit for minimum damage against sitting targets, so I have to asume your number is more off then mine. <br>
Oh, 1300 is enuff to kill a golem wanded caster generaly.<br>
<br>
Sitting caster, golem wand and duelist is pretty close to 90% instant kill. It basicly hangs on double backstab and how much the single backstab does else. But the odds of surviving is still pretty low if you dont die instantly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uauroreakengro.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aurore Akengro</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/28/02 10:02:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=52.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Logs and dps</span><hr size=1> Aerimus puts a single dueliest BS at 600, I believe he said 660 which is where I think it really is. So a double would be along the lines of 1200~1300. Add a round of melee and you are around 1500 on average I agree. Yes with golem wand you are sure to die. I do however believe that to do 2000 pts of damage in 1 duellist round you got to be pretty lucky or have 255 str. Doubt you'll be getting that sort of damage in 'average' gear.<br>
<br>
I think that my friend would have taken off her cloak that gives her 75hps or so which would put her at 1866 hps, pretty close to the figure I was claiming. Yes, of course this is Rallos Zek, so not everyone runs around in their best gear, and yes maybe living through an extra lure would be important BUT it is pointless to try to live through that on RZ because you are hardly in a 1v1 situation where both have something at stake, if you are fighting a wizard, chances are you got ganked at a portal by him and at least another friend. I think that's where all this 'wizards own' confusion comes from.<br>
<br>
Check my logs on the other thread, buffed I took 3 rounds of duellist, unbuffed I'd be dead in a double BS. With MB, no need to debuff, that's one of the 2 major advantages I see along with sniping people from far away without them getting the cast message (which is best advantage). The other thing is that in a prepared situation, caster won't be sitting thus the damage on BS will be lower. Honnestly, from my testing I truly believe that channeling 6sec cast with skin up vs. a non bash/stun class is 90% if not more, so if you don't get debuffed before casting then interrupted rogue is pretty much dead.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> safehouse I got that minimum backstab with duelist is somewhere around 566.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Err vs. a sitting foe maybe? Regular BS min is I believe 2x your level thus 120 at level 60 (if you don't miss), don't see how duellist would give you 566 min dmg, I'll check up on that tho.<br>
<br>
I believe rogues don't need fear a non MB enabled wiz, but that they can't do anything against a MB enabled one. In either case, there's no balance though.<br>
<br>
Finaly, there is gimped and gimped. That's why I posted profile. As someone rudely remarked to my friend 'Why are you wearing level 50 gear?' she said 'As the oldest rogue on Rallos I am allowed to wear what I like.'<br>

Its 388 as far as I know.  Thats the number I've heard and seen time and again.  What I'm going for is the average combat round dmg during a duelist round in which you get to bs.<br>
<br>
I'll break it down for you again.  I'll even go a bit further in the break down.  A slight change I will have to make is the double bs percentage.  I could get no accurate info on the change in double bs percentages even from high lvl rogues.  What I got were guesses and estimates so I did a test at 58 I attempt a double 55% of the time.  at 55 it was 40%. I'm going to take a wild guess and say its a linear progression making the double bs percentage at 60 65%.<br>
<br>
I'm skipping the rounds in which you mess up your bs attempt for the round due to bad execution of lag.<br>
<br>
First the regular combat. 0-4 attacks.  Max hit with a 15 dmg weapon will be roughly 96.  Average should be around 1/2 max.  To this a 4x weapon dmg bonus will be added.  I'll just assume both weapons are 15 dmg.  Average duelist hit will be 108.  Given a double attack, duel wield and hit ratio of 2/3 you will get an average of around 2 landed melee hits per round (if you want to be exact its 1.81 but you can't really get 1.81 hits now can you). To break this down.<br>
<br>
Main hand- 1 x 1.66 (double attacks) x .66(misses)<br>
Offhand   - 1x .66(duel wield) x 1.66(double attacks)<br>
<br>
So average dmg per duelist round via normal melee will be roughly 216<br>
<br>
Next we have to look at backstab. As stated hit ratio should be around 2/3 double bs same. Max dmg without an uber +bs skill weapon during duelist is 1106 I'll assume the average is somewhere 1/2 max or 553 as with all melee.<br>
<br>
Types of rounds.<br>
<br>
Single or double miss(18%)<br>
Average bs dmg 0<br>
Average regular melee dmg 216<br>
Average total dmg per round 216<br>
<br>
Single hit or double with 1 hit(52%)<br>
Average bs dmg 553<br>
Average regular melee dmg 216<br>
Average total dmg per round 769<br>
<br>
Double hit (30%)<br>
Average bs dmg 1106<br>
Average regular melee dmg 216<br>
Average total dmg per round 1322<br>
<br>
Almost 20% of the time its a wash and the caster laughs it off (if he isn't snared heh)<br>
<br>
About 50% of the time it hurts.<br>
<br>
About 30% of the time you stand a good chance of dying from it if you don't have your skin up or yonder immediately.<br>
<br>
You could average it out to about a bit over 800 dmg (it is a bit higher than I thought earlier because of the double bs percentage thing I mentioned) per round but the above breakdown gives you better info I think.<br>
<br>
Basicly what were going towards is that indoors a rogue running around golem wanding and duelist smacking wizards indoors will probably kill 3/10 right off. (1 for every 1.5k he burns) Gee wonder why wands aren't used more?  There is VERY good chance that the wizard at that point will either be healed by his group, gate, or run.<br>
<br>
Outdoors I suggest you yonder upon being insta dispelled.  The rogue will get tired of burning gobs of plat.  Then it will be reserved for a finishing blow when your hp drops down low enough for a single average round to drop you.  Nothing like a one hit one kill MB.  <br>
<br>
Even with hp that low it should if you play it right have a reasonably high flub factor. (in other words try to avoid exposing your back, back off when he starts to circle you to bs, start and stop quickly to make him waste duelist on a failed attempt)  <br>

Average damage is generaly (min+max)/2.<br>
Usualy for melee this is max/2 as the min damage is very low. But when using a skill like duelist the min damage goes up alot (even more so for backstab). To make it easier for you so does this give an average bs of 736 (using your min damage for backstab wich I dont know if its right).<br>

Not counting anyone that dies 1 second later when the next round of melee. Also this is a generaly low estimate of how many will die. Still, asuming you are even semi competent (know how to turn on attack and backstab) so should you be able to kill at least 1/10 of those others before they gate. And as you are on an item loot server, so if you can loot something worth 750pp on average so will you do fine.<br>

A good rogue would use the wand right before he hits, not from any long range. Its entirely possible to use wand several times, start disc, backstack, start attack all in short enuff time to not give the target any time to react.<br>
