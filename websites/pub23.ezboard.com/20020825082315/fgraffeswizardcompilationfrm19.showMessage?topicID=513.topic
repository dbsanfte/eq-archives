Moreover, a wizard really doesnt come into his own until the mid to late 40s, arguably even his 50s.  Fact of the matter is, there is no easy way to level a wizzy.  All the &quot;easy&quot; ways, such as quadding, kiting, etc take a lot of time, a lot of patience, and a LOT of downtime.  Unfortunately, you really cant do those things until you get to at least 16 or so, and then they're still really hard.  I didnt master kiting until I was nearly 25, and quadding until I was nearly 40.  Now I go and do them no problem, but I still prefer the group atmosphere.<br><br>If you want to level up a character fast and do incredible damage, might i suggest the way of the rogue or the warrior?  Easily twinkable, fast to level, and everyone wants one in their group.  On most blue servers, everyone looks down on the low level wizard (read everyone that is *NOT* 60), and its near impossible to get groups.  Get a good group of friends, find some spots that you like, and stick with them for a while.  The only way your going to be respected is to learn your class, and let people know that you know how to play.<br><br>There are a lot of good wizards out there that better our reputation as a whole, and then there are those that keep us down in the slumps.  It takes a good wizard to level, it takes a patient wizard to level, and theres usually a good chanter behid them too =)<br><br>If you really want to be a wizzy, stick it out, but dont expect things to come easy for you.  The only gear that even remotely helps wizzies level is FT gear, or items with free nukes on them, but your not going to see those for a LONG time.<br><br>Yiar<br>59.3 Evoker<br>Resolution -Firiona Vie <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usenwiz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>senwiz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/31/02 12:45:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm19.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=513.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Wizard for you?</span><hr size=1> I must agree with the sentiments expressed here. I too was like you. It took me awhile to get beyond that level 10 bareer (Sp?) Being a DE I ran around Nektulos, EC, WC, and NRO at level 9. That is about the fastest way I know. Groups are very hard. Sometimes you find people that don't understand what our class is truly about, and that is ashame really. Everyone I know, from my younger levels is now 34 plus.

I once dinged into 28 and found it impossible to hold it using my old haunts. I do have a 51 SK also. The standard routes, ie OOM, LOIO, FM, OT, just don't work for me with my Wizzie. He's a lot more fragile than my SK ever was. That stated, and to reiterate what was said in past posts...Patience is vital here. Wizards do come into their own, and since my SK hit 43, he hasn't been on a raid without a couple of them coming along, much to detrement of my exp bar.

So I just wanna have both now ;-)<br><br>and no, I didn't want to go through the hell of early levels completly untwinked again. So hell yeah, I gave myself some boost and it worked out nicely so far :-)<br>I don't want to play a melee char, but being for the first time a tank is fun ;-)  But with every level it gets harder now ;-)<br><br><br>and why I want to play a Wizard mainly is: I wanna do some AE groups in my high levels ...sometime ;-)<br>Mages arent really liked there so I need to get a Wizard up there somehow ;-) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=170427" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.euphorion.org/sig/euph_zdd2.jpg" border="0"></a> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ueuphorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphorion</A>&nbsp;
