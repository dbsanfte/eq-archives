Is this the price we pay for being able to solo well?  A well put together dungeon group can get better exp and loot than I can solo, and (unless it's ae, which I've done only once up to lvl58 )  they sure don't want a wizard.<br><br>So why is there such a pvp ability divide between int casters and melee?  If a 60 warrior with a tantor's tusk or primal 2h /disc on me, it's as good as a manaburn.  Isn't it fair that wizards, as the masters of magical direct damage, actually get similar powers to kill?<br><br>Let's look at the facts people!  In PvP, melees on average have better resists, much more hp, much more ac, don't have to worry about getting interrupted non stop from insanely low channeling in pvp, and if they get near their opponent they inflict damage faster than wizards.  How exactly is this fair to int casters on pvp servers?  Because we get yonder +gate?  Fantastic, cause if yonder+gate wins fights, that must mean wizards are the best. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Before anyone brings up the subject of naked caster ganking on Rallos Zek, keep in mind that on the other pvp servers people keep their droppable armor on all the time.  So comparing pvp on RZ to, say, Sullon Zek is ridiculus.<br><br>I am really hoping manaburn remains as is in Pvp.  I wish they would fix pvp channeling because even green melees can interrupt me continously with hits for 20, even if I can channel through a froglok hitting me for 120s.  And i would like int caster's to be able to be immune to magic better than melees and priests--wizards are one the the easier classes for a another wizard to kill.<br><br>That being said, Wizard Manaburn and Necro Lifeburn will be nerfed in pvp, melees will get more monster-like in pvp, and Verant will show once again that they do not understand reality.<br><br>-neuroticus <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujeshuah.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jeshuah</A> at: 3/1/02 7:54:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uaerimusshadowborn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aerimus Shadowborn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/1/02 8:53:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: good ol' fashioned nerf inc</span><hr size=1> There is this amazing thing you can do when a melee uses a disc on you...

Oh and being able to kill people through walls is fantastic, so fantastic I've done it maybe once. 99% of PvP on sullon zek (not Rallos Zek, where you aren't sure who your enemy is) is done when you know about where your opponent is after the first attack. Also, I need to target my opponent first to nuke him, and that means being able to see him. If a melee finds me in a dungeon, I am in deep trouble, so your example of PvP in a dungeon is honestly a toss up.  <br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Actually if your a class with a commandable pet all you need to do is /pet attack name, /assist pet to get them on target without ever comming near them then just run around spamming a spell key till they are in range.  You can also try targeting them and hiding somewhere to nuke or any number of ideas.<br><br>About pumice...if they have 2 insta buff items like jboots and grim aura earing they can nullify the effect of pumicing by reclicking them and keeping them on top.<br><br>About wands...you can't use them in every fight if you don't have plat comming out of...<br><br><br><br>Quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Yes, thanks for telling me The Trick! /sarcasm off.

Gee why did I choose to be lvl 58 and not 60, silly me!<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Actually I was told there was a signifigant channeling buff by gaining 60 that isn't described by any skill increase... by a caster. This would make sense considering 60 rogues claim that there is a noticable difference as far as dmg just by gaining 60 more so than skill caps would acount for.  Btw its not just the increase in channeling at 60.  Channeling skilll really is based on a loc comparision between the start and the end of the cast and you really can counter the movement of melee dmg by moving back a hair.<br><br>Quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Wrong, yet again.

You can't even do it with draughts and lures to any real degree.  The only way I can land sure hits is if I can move faster than you.  Say I'm sowed and you have neither sow nor jboots or if your poisoned.<br><br>Quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Hmm, I guess hitting auto attack and the backstab button does require fine motor skills. Btw, I have heard a rogue in my guild claim he can backstab people from the front due to some weird bug no doubt. In my experience, backstabs in pvp are a sure thing.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I guess fighting someone with all the manueverability and skill of a rotting treestump would take about zero skill but real pvpers ya know...move around and try to turn to avoid bses.  Its not a bug the trick is to run by them and hit bs as you pass exactly behind them and its not as easy as it sounds. Bses are far from a sure thing and I bet your &quot;pvp experience&quot; is on a blue server. Just the fact that you say bses are a sure thing indicates your lack of skill.<br><br><br>Quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> Armor class is about the least used statistic in PVP (which is the point of this thread if you guys haven't realized yet).<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Actually AC is a huge factor in melee vs melee pvp and is somewhat of a factor vs pet classes but I was speaking of HP anyway.<br><br>Quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br> Oh, it's amusing how you fail to mention a lvl 60 rogue can with not a lot of difficulty (or AAexp points like a wiz mb) kill a int caster in 1 melee round, IE /disc, backstab. A shadow knight can do almost the same with harmtouch and a couple life taps. A warrior can do almost the same, especially if he manages to land a stun kick and /disc. And don't forget monk and rangers can do a little damage to!  This is how it's 'supposed to be'?<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Sk are overpowered (duh). Duelist isn't anything close to a sure kill unless you are medding unbuffed with your back to your attacker.

Don't forget that when a melee is chasing someone, he can keep inflicting damage, while if a caster is moving, it severly lessens his ability to cast spells heh.<br>By the way, if you think my robe puts up a good defense to your epic dagger, you need to remove your head from your behind.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Actually I can't keep dmging someone running from me. If they are dumb enough to run in a straight line I will get occasional hits.  A little bit of weaving and server prediction isn't good enough to hit you AT all.<br><br>&quot;seriously, I am not surprised that a rogue, of all melees, is spouting his pvp wisdom at me as to why the current pvp status quo should be kept intact sans manaburn. Obviously, things are NOT balanced in *real* pvp (IE non-rallos zek pvp).&quot;<br><br>So you think rogues are the gods of pvp rofl? <br><br>Also, if you thought things were unbalanced before, just wait til your local monster melee gets a hold of the new 74/95 2hb (everquest.allakhazam.com/...tem=10201)<br><br>Wow an item that every class but me can use to hit for around what I bs for.

In my experience around Crushbone/GFay Area, basically Melees have a better chance of survival if not pvp success.  So far these posts have neglected the fact that, at least in my experience on Tallon, much of the pvp combat happens over flared tempers or just instantaneously.  Those that camp people out just to pk are a minority.  Consider this, in a quick skirmish near CB zone, a dwarf warrior attacks my twinked HE wizzy, or mutual suspision causes us to attack simultaneously.  He has the HPs to survive the skirmish even if I root/nuke.  He can simply zone once the root breaks, that is if it held in the first place.  Warriors, at least at low lvls have distinctive advantage in their naturally higher mr.  My roots are resisted around 60% of the time. Against twink melees I'm lucky if one ever sticks.  Not to mention the fizzles and resists and 66%nerf.  Even with an int of 168 and full manna starting, I would be hard pressed to kill a similar level warrior.  Once a melee starts pouding my wussy elf wizzy into the ground near a zone, Shadowstep does little to get me away in time to gate or run, provided I have enough manna.  Again I've no exp with High lvl pvp, but at low lvls melees have definate advantages in their chance for survival.<br><br>Now duels are another story.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uznailvh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Znail vh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/5/02 6:37:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=51.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: good ol' fashioned nerf inc</span><hr size=1> Q:<br>---------------------------------------------------------<br>The thing is &quot;just moving&quot; to avoid a mannaburn implies running like hell.

Generally its refered to as KITING!  You don't have to run away run in a circle if you like for 12 whole seconds to avoid a dmg disc.<br><br>About pvp kills at high lvl, most occur when people try to fight back and lose, get snared blinded or rooted, get taken down by multiple people, or killed when fighting mobs.  In my experience this is very true of melees killing casters due to the melee range issue, and very true of casters killing melees due to the melees hp and the fact that we can run out of range faster than you can cast nukes.<br><br><br>As a rule from what I've seen people that run early and hard rarely die even to gang bang squads supposing they can resist root and snare.  As I've explained before the average duelist round isn't enough to kill a standing caster and the melee range issue is enough to allow them to make a quick retreat without much chance of a finishing shot (unless they are snared) if they are badly injured.
