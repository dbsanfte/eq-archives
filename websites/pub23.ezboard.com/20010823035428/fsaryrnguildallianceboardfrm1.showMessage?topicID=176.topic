<br>
Well we had a good run yesterday and I wanted to start this thread to post what we learned in the new Hate so we can discuss it and be better prepaired for the next trip.<br>
<br>
1. We need to start early. Starting at 11 am est does not work for us at all on the weekends. We have gotten beaten to the plane 2 out of 3 times and as we now know a broken hate is a mediocre raid at best drop wise.<br>
<br>
2. The imps in the SW corner are wussy and don't tend to move from the SW corner. You can run through them, kill them and then move away with noaggro from the next batch that pop. Also meaning the SW camp is still viable if you can get to it.<br>
<br>
3. The Aggro range on 50 plus is small all things considered. We did well with not aggroing to much and only getting the occasional add.<br>
<br>
4. The 1st floor boss mobs albeit a bit tougher then your standard hate mob I think they were level 56 or 57 seem to consistently drop and maybe even 2 pieces of class armor.<br>
<br>
5. Sobek is not liked in Hate. For some reason he was marked for death by the 2nd floor and got HT's frequently. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We need to figure this one out cause I don't think it had to do with wall aggro, maybe a song he was playing not sure.<br>
<br>
6. Stay off the walls when fighting.<br>
<br>
7. 4 groups of 50 plus can easily kill the mobs on the 1st floor.<br>
<br>
8. Rouge's are a must for hate. Once Diadem was there the pulls were alot more percise and we pulled much faster.<br>
<br>
We camped the Zone in first as we got our mess together which went well. We then moved to the SW corner which also worked well. Then we moved to the Maestro house / throne room. All of these spots worked well for us as camps even though we didn't have a full pop zone wise.<br>
<br>
Things I think people weren't aware of:<br>
<br>
Rats and Liches are not static pops but 30 min spawn time roamers. Hence the large amount of rats killed.<br>
<br>
Revenants are static spawns, we got these cause the previous guild hadn't pulled them.<br>
<br>
Hate is by no means like Fear. All though the mobs are the same level and drop class loot like fear the similarity ends there. The nature of the house's static spawns and the small streets makes hate more deadly in some respects. You can never really tell what your going to aggro when you walk through hate due to that and the patrols. CR in hate is horrible compared to fear. You can't just zone in and once there you have all the previously mentioned to contend with while CR'n.<br>
<br>
All in all a good raid given the circumstances. Please post anything that I missed so that we can keep a list of things to be aware of for those going to hate.<br>

If you are planning on going on a raid plan to be there, NOT just get up there then go log for a couple hours and come back later. You force the entire raid party to have to wait while they a) have to get you, b) CR you  c) worry with you training into the main camp.<br>
<br>
Cash Loots - I listened to a fair amount of bickering both ooc and in my group.  The hate stones are about 250pp and the chanters and cleric burn some some serious plat on a 8 hour raid keeping the buffs up also. THAT is way those individuals get dibs on the cash loots. Anything that exceeds the costs for those individuals will get rolled on as Zenknight let us roll.<br>
<br>
Xp - Raids tend to be xp poor for the most part. There were complaints that the groups were rigged for xp.  We had a cleric shortage and therefore the tanks get put into groups with a cleric that could HEAL them. On a raid we are there to kill the mobs in the most efficient manner possible. If groups can be balanced then they will be, but the raid leader has to assess how to ensure success with the least amount of risk. We get wiped nobody gets anything but a really boring day.<br>
<br>
Last Topic - Sobek:  This is a marked bard, please be careful around him. I have never seen anyone able to get Harm touched so efficiently. I still think his new BP came equipped with electroshock therapy built in. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
I didn't realize we were getting complaints like that accept for the loot.<br>
<br>
Ok for the record PLANES RAIDS ARE NOT MEANT FOR EXP THEY ARE MEANT FOR LOOT!!!<br>
<br>
Typical group make up in Hate at least works like this.<br>
<br>
Typical Pull group<br>
<br>
Monk FD puller Sk's can be used but monk's are usualy better<br>
Rouge Scout<br>
War Tagger Taunter<br>
Clr Enuff said<br>
Enc Mez<br>
Wiz Porter and big damage<br>
<br>
Typically High HP tanks are grouped with the clerics due to the ability to taunt mobs off of casters. Enchanters are the same group with the clerics so they live longer then 3 seconds when a mez is broken.<br>
<br>
So the groups were designed for survivability not xp the pull group was heavy with damage dealers and we did get the most exp of the night.<br>
<br>
On a fear raid you can do a number of things differently group wise for exp balance, it's an outside zone with plenty of room to pull and fight with little aggro. Hate is not. Hate is an inside zone a town to be exact and with a full pop you can aggro a ton of stuff while fighting, the groups were designed to kill fast which is a neccessity when it get's ugly. If you don't believe me ask the enchanters cause they are all Hate veterans and I doubt they would disagree.<br>
<br>
I know that it seems as if we can all just go on a planes raid and should be able to get exp. Like I have said a few times now Hate is not Fear, Hate can be much worse then Fear due to building aggro and the greater chance of a very long expensive CR. You can't fear, snare, root or use pets really and every where you fight is a confined space.<br>
<br>
We as an organization need to get a handle on our expectations for these raids. If you go expecting loot or exp then your out of luck. Sometimes the loot falls and sometimes it doesn't and EXP on a large scale raid is usually dominated by one or 2 groups. I know some people that have done 100 or so hate runs and still haven't gotten all of their class armor. You can't go expecting to get anything especially with 5 other of your class there. Treat loot and exp as a bonus to going and when you do get a piece of class armor or loot it will make all worth while.<br>

Your leaving in itself was no biggie. However, once that door is open ppl can say well they don't mind if I play for a couple hours, log out, and join back in a bit. How well will it play out if we had several ppl doing this across the course of a raid? What if the zone had repopped while you were gone? The planes have a lot of variables that are hard to predict and having ppl coming and going is not good, IMHO. However, there are always exceptions. We just need to make the ppl understand they are the exception and not the rule. The only point is not to jeopardize the rest of the raid unneccesarily under any circumstance.<br>
<br>
My comments are geared to providing the most cohesive, effective, and fun raid as possible, as i see it. If I have issue with a specific person they will know it. <br>

For future reference you can keep your snide little comments about taking RL into consideration to yourself. Most of us are all acutely aware what RL is. <p>Krytog Spiritwalker

It's what I do when I play EQ.  Some people I know play EQ thru all the distractions in the RL, that's no exaggeration but that's not what I do.  Everyone who has played with me or known me long enough, KNOWS that I will decline invites or raids if I have something I need to finish in RL or otherwise busy with something in game.  This was slightly different because I had promised Zenknight on attending the raid and something came up in RL that I needed to take care of.  I thought you meant me when you made that logging for a few hours comment because I was the only one, that I knew of, who had to log upon porting in.  Not a unreasonable assumption under the circumstances.<br>
<br>
P.S: I fully understand the implications involved logging for a few in the middle of a big raid and no, I didn't think of the possible future implications when it comes people wanting to log in the middle of a raid.  I've been to more than my share of long, large scale raids.  That was why I asked Zenknight if I should go or not due to the circumstances in the first place.  I just don't want something like this to come back and bite me in the ass or in your arguement, people using it as an excuse of &quot;if he did it, so can I&quot;, since I did clear it with the raid leader and it was okayed. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/utelivaksk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TelivakSK</A> at: 4/30/01 11:53:43 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#6A74B4><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubamilbanebringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bamil Banebringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br> <font color=#FFFF00>(4/30/01 12:24:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fsaryrnguildallianceboardfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=176.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Lessons from Hate</span><hr size=1> Alright, I'm bigger than both of you so I suggest you break it up.

<br>
As for Hate, I think it went well. We have plenty of room for improvement, but this is a huge step from our last Hate run, (gigantic understatement).<br>
<br>
We need to keep the OOC'ing to a minimum, it was very distracting at times. Let the pull team decide what to pull. We also should set a definitive time when we say we are going to quit. This will allow people to plan for things in RL or ingame, as well as provide us a timeframe for which we would need to request reinforcements for any willing to stay.<br>
<br>
Overall I think we did a great job, only the occasional death and some decent loot/cash drops. Let's continue to improve.<br>

I think like Bamil said it was a major improvment over the last one hehe 2 hour CR for me, but experiance comes through death, learning and figuring out why you always put your socks on inside out.<br>
<br>
Not only was it a chance to see the new hate but also meet other members of the SGA and get to know them a bit better which builds good teamwork and the ability to randomly ask people for buffs when they are 12 zones away ( just kidding ) I hope the next raid goes as smoothly!<br>

<br>
1. AOEs are the way to death or adds. Chanters should not use AOE stuns and I believe a certain bard got in trouble with AOE offensive spells.<br>
<br>
2. Hotkey targets. What do you say? The way I can cast clarity two on 15 to 20 different people is that I have a hotkey for each person who requests clarity. For example I have a hotkey with title &quot;Holt&quot; and have &quot;/tar holt&quot; in the body of the hotkey. That way I can select anyone I want in the raid. Healers might consider doing this same thing to heal each other even those in separate groups. Maybe the healers from two groups could aggree to back up each other in this manner. (I apologize if all the healers are already doing this. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
3. Chanters should hotkey assist for each other. Then when a mob aggros on one chanter the others can use hotkey to select that mob to mez. We also should have a hotkey with a tell to another chanter &quot;assist me please and mezz this sucker that is kicking my butt&quot;<br>
<br>
4. OCC comments should be kept to a minimum. I know it is boring and I also use OOC tooooo much. But we need to stop all the extra spam.<br>
<br>
5. Adds need to be shouted out. It is very hard for chanters to see what is happening. So tell us about extra mobs so we can mez them.<br>
<br>
6. The minor bosses can not be effectively mezzed so we should kill those first if we got more than one mob in the pull.<br>
<br>
7. DOTs is something we should talk about. I stopped using them because if we need to switch targets the chanter trying to mez the old target (that has been DOTed) gets eatten alive. Also there is a little trouble with dispelling mobs and DOTs.<br>
<br>
8. The raid leader obviously has the authority to let someone log and come back. Telivak and Krytog covered all the important points about this above.<br>
<br>
9. Reality Check.  The planes are not about exp, or cash loot. They are about planes equipment (uber loot), planes gems, and working together as a team. The chance of getting some uber loot is about one-in-five. So every fifth planes raid or so you should get something. Some people get more than this; some less. When we get higher level and can do second floor in Hate mobs, the chance of getting loot will improve.<br>
<br>
10. Whining about experience, cash, or what mobs are pulled is really not helpful. If you have some knowledge that would be useful to the pull team, meantion it to the raid leader. If you think the puller might have missed two mobs that hide in a certain corner, please tell that to the raid leader. Remember you should not expect to get anything on 4 out of five raids.<br>

<br>
On a traditional hate plane break sticking close is paramount.  We'd have been wiped soo easy if there had been a full pop but of course we were aware we were entering with few pops, no spites up for sure, so it is certainly understandable and good that we could be more relaxed. <br>
<br>
Now its been my exp (from a chanters point of view of course)what a usual hate break can be like. We port up 3 groups strong minimum attempt to make first camp w/o aggroing anything then camp out and come back just in case rinse repeat with rest.  <br>
<br>
In an unbroken plane I have never been in charge of keeping less that 3 mobs at bay till we were ready to take em and thats with 4 chanters minimum so all of you who were dyin to see stuff drop, no worries in an unbroken plane they will, but it will be at a price, that price being the possible total wipeout af all involved.  This is unlike any other raid that we (SGA) may stage, Hate you simply dont evac out of, you pray that at least one cleric can camp in time and one rogue or fd type makes it, and can let us know when to come back up.  <br>
<br>
One thing I cannot stress enough if you aggro anything Stand and Die or its 2-4 hour cr time.  Do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars.  <br>
<br>
The other most important thing that I saw was that many wandered from the camp a bit, when I say a bit it may only have been a few feet but that can mean total wipeout.  We definitely had a great turnout and proved that we can take hate as an all SGA crew.  Everyone showed a great amount of patience, commendations are in order for all who came <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
 <br>
I wont address the exp/loot thing, think thats been covered, thats not what the planes are about however I would like to adress the issue of people logging for a while and coming back.  <br>
<br>
Now we havent the numbers other guilds who do hate regularly, but none the less I havent been on one hate raid where it was not acceptable for people in intervals to break and log to eat or scream or whatever.  However it needs to be orchestrated so we arent left screwed.  But its my feeling the raid always goes better when people arent edgey due to burnout I mean c'mon hate is a 8-12 hour commitment so we must allow what is neccesary to make it succesful and the general feeling amongst the crew doing it is paramount.<br>
<br>

So if you see me say &quot;This raid sucks we're only getting xp on half the mobs&quot;, chances are I'm not serious<br>
