It was purported by many, that Wizards had rediscovered the ability to summon forth a Familiar; a being from another plane of existence, not unlike the wizard that called it into view. It was said these “familiars” where a part of their master, a kind of inner reflection of one’s magical self. It was also stated in the reports these things seemed rather willful, and were nothing like the already known minions of the Mages, Tribal Shaman, and Necromancers. <br>”Might as well see what all the fuss is about” He often wondered why he was destined to follow the path of the seeker of knowledge when he thoroughly hated to be surprised. Taking a moment to clear his mind, he memorized the attached spell scroll so as to call forth the creature. Opening his eyes, and taking a deep breath he began speaking the ancient words, in a dialect of Combine lost ages ago. At first a tiny portal seemed to open, not unlike the portals he used to travel about Norrath. But this was very different, and he could feel it. In an instant, a red, flying Imp immerged through portal and began flapping around the room. It must have detected Zed’s shock at its arrival, and smiled revealing a rather large set of teeth. As it hung in the air, flapping its wings slowly to keep itself aloft it stared at Zed with its dark eyes. It’s eyes… They were black as the Void itself, and that stare had the unmistakable look of timeless magic. This being was definitely pure magic itself. Zed eyed the imp suspiciously, wondering if it was somehow capable of sentient thought. “So I am your master is it?” The imp smiled that mischievous smile and looked directly into Zed’s gaze. “That you are Wizard Zorander. I have come a great distance to help you. You have summoned me forth from beyond, and I shall serve to aid you in your quest.” Zed was shocked to realize its lips weren’t moving, in fact it was speaking to him through a kind of telepathic bond, as if they were somehow linked. Through this link he was beginning to feel other affects as well. He seemed to somehow be more resistant to various forms of magic, and could feel the flow of magic through his very being to be somehow, augmented. So it was true. They did seem to be beneficial in some way. He reminded himself not to decide until spending time studying this creature. ”What quest, and how do you know my name? I do not recall giving you such information, I work on many different quests and I’ll thank you to leave such matters to me, I do not require the help of, of one such as you.” “Oh but you do”, replied the imp as it flapped lazily around the room. “Indeed you do”. “Nonsense, now will you alight somewhere? That infernal flapping is beginning to make me ill!” “Very well master”, and then he flew over to Zed’s favorite chair and perched himself on the back. First stretching and then folding away his wings, he then returned to staring at Zed with those eyes. ”And stop calling me master, or I’ll return you to where you came. You’ve yet to prove your presence is in anyway beneficial to me.” “You know very well my presence aids you Zed” he chortled softly. “You were just thinking so moments earlier”. “Now see here Imp, I don’t know what exactly you are but I intend to find out, and in the meantime don’t think you can go rooting around in my head, understood?” “Clearly master”, he cooed. “What do you call yourself? You seem to have some sort of intelligence, if not severely limited.” The Imp again held Zed in that timeless dark gaze for a moment before replying. ”I am called Gratch. You may refer to me as such, if it is your wish, oh great one.” “Indeed, then you shall be known as Gratch. Now, let’s get to work, I have many questions I’m sure you can assist me with. I wish to know your origins, what your world is like, or plane of existence. I must begin my documentation for the Council of Erudin at once.” “In due time great Wizard, in due time. I would suggest we go to the great hall for the noon meal, you are hungry and wish to do that yes?” This thing was going to be a lot of trouble, very much indeed. “Very well, I suppose I will have my noon meal, wait here and I’ll return later.” “I’m afraid that’s not possible master, you see in order for our Bond to remain in tact, I must accompany you wherever you go”, he absently fumbled with his claws appearing as if he were bored in some way. ”If I lose that connection and am returned to my origins, the resulting affects of such an abrupt disconnection from the bond would be,,, rather painful for you I’m afraid”. He flapped his wings and rose up into the air and was once again circling the room, as if looking for something. Flapping over to a high shelf he examined the various bottles of potion components and a few dusty tomes. This creature was nosey, and Zed didn’t like it, not one bit. As he stared at Gratch poking about the jars on the shelf, he was becoming more and more annoyed with each passing minute. “So you mean to tell me I’m stuck with you, is that it? What in the name of Quellious am I going to do with a nosy Imp, get down from there at once!” Gratch briefly glanced at Zed, and then lazily drifted down to hover near him. “The bonding can be a trying experience master, please try and adjust willingly. You’ll find the discoveries you make will be highly rewarding and beneficial to you. Isn’t that what you want after all? To seek knowledge and further your council of Wizards?” Still glaring, he conceded this was probably right. “Very well, but I warn you imp, stay out of my way, and under no circumstances are you to make a pest of yourself while you are here. I get one report of your causing chaos, just one, and I swear before Quellious himself I will send you back from where you came, do you understand me?”<br>Smiling that knowing smile of his, he replied that it was. With that he left his study and headed for the great hall, putting the thought of his newly acquired “guest” out of his mind, Zed wondered how the others would react to Gratch’s presence. His headache grew at the notion of impending mischief this would lead to. No other sect was allowed to have their minions in the Keep, because of the potential for fighting and other problems. He groaned at the notion of being summoned before the Elder Council to explain his actions, or to answer for some infraction the imp had broken. Lost in his thoughts, he didn’t notice until he was almost at the greathall that the incessant flapping had ceased. He turned and to his horror, did not see Gratch. It appeared, as though Gratch would be exploring Familia Keep on his own. Zed groaned in frustration and continued into the greathall... <br><br><br>edit:<br><br>yes, the name gratch was shamelessly borrowed from some favorite books of mine, althought I forget the name of the series <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>Zed<br>52 Channeler of La Familia<br>Fennin Ro <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uzeddoffennin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeddoffennin</A> at: 1/5/02 11:17:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ualinestormbringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aline Stormbringer</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/image/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/6/02 12:48:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Introducing,  Gratch</span><hr size=1> Put some paragraphs in there for god's sake! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uzeddoffennin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zeddoffennin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/6/02 8:13:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Introducing,  Gratch</span><hr size=1> &quot;As you wish,,, oh great one...&quot;<br><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udalv.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalv</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/7/02 4:49:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm37.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Introducing,  Gratch</span><hr size=1> Hey, <br>       That is all fun and games, until you realize that you have just used everything but Richard. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Fun...Fun....
