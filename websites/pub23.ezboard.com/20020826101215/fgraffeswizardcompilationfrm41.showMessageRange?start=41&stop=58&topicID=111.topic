<br>
&quot;Some of the XML I stole from other UIs on eqinterface.com, and the rest of it I did myself (about 70% of the changes are my own, the other 30% is borrowed code).&quot;<br>
<br>
I ganked also but I was very careful to list who I got it from and exactly where I got it. <br>
<br>
You want me to give my stuff away for nothing to someone like yourself who won't even say that you got it from me. Har Har Har.<br>
<br>
Well its an age old argument between creators and users won't be settled here.<br>
<br>
There is one thread here that tells how to move labels or gauges from one file to another, once you know that you can do everything I did with minimal effort.<br>
<br>
Ok my main reason is that I don't want ot give away 30 hours of work for free fine. Also once they patch that bug you can trade individual files without goofing everything up.<br>
<br>
<br>
I helped this guy out:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm41.showMessage?topicID=139.topic">pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm41.showMessage?topicID=139.topic</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Now he has a Player and Target Window in one that some will like better than mine, and he is willing to give his 6 hours of work up, naturally I didn't have me to help me when I started so it took me longer, and as ususal my name does not appear anywhere for the help heh....:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm41.showMessage?topicID=147.topic">pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm41.showMessage?topicID=147.topic</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Once you can do move items from one file to another you can do anything that I did. <br>
<br>
So no more complaints you can just ask him for your custom modes now.<br>

(I play on Test, not Sullon Zek -- PvP can't hold a candle to the shit we put up with sometimes. Ever plan a NTOV raid but have it cancelled because TOV zone-crashes every time someone ports out?)<br>
<br>
Good point about the credits, though. In my haste to belittle you, I forgot those who <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> had</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> already given away their work, for which I apologize. So, here's the list: (I'll update the zip file's readme with this when I get home).<br>
<br>
- Inventory window: original by Sylphan.<br>
- Player, target, and group windows were originally by Rombus Mindspire (under &quot;All Others&quot; on eqinterface.com). They were all heavily modified from his original, however. (Incidentally, using vim-6.0-minimal on a 25-line display is not fun. I need to reinstall my Linux box...)<br>
- Book window was inspired by several mods that minimize it, but all the code was done myself.<br>
- Bazaar, container, and spellgems windows were entirely my idea and code (although I've since seen numerous other mods that do exactly what I did, or what I did and more, so it's not like I'm special or anything).<br>
<br>
All the other changes were my own ideas and code. Actually, the 30/70 number I gave before was lopsided; I was thinking about the number of windows, not lines of code. More like 60/40, mostly in favor of Sylphan who created the original slim inventory window that I based mine on. <p><center><img src="http://matt.waggoner.com/images/rohane-sig.jpg" width="600" height="100" border="0"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=setch>Setch</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/30/02 4:36:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> no seriously</span><hr size=1> seriously.<br>
<br>
My appraisal of the deathwalker BATTLE UI.<br>
<br>
Designing your UI to fit on the top of the screen is a logical move. I like it. It puts the most important line of text (the newest one) as close to the view center as possible.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I just don't think I could handle it aesthetically. I'm not used to having a bunch of windows on the top of the screen... it feels like I'm standing under a cliff.<br>
<br>
Similarly, I like your emphasis on minimalism, but I think you took it too far. At some point, you have to respect the fact that a digital readout is not as easy or as fast to read as an analog display like a bar. I sure wouldn't want to be stuck in combat with a -number- as the only reference to my health.<br>
<br>
I want my vital stats to be visible at a glance and be instantly clear even through someone else's prescription glasses. You shouldn't have to look twice to tell if you're dying.<br>
<br>
And the target health is worse... it's in red. It's practically illegible.<br>
<br>
Moreover.. this is what I really don't get. After throwing away the most critical bar - the player health - you turn around and set aside a large amount of space for the group hp bars. wtf? Maybe that's a design decision that single-character players just can't grasp...<br>
<br>
Aside from that, I like your buff list and horizontal spell bar. <br>
<br>
I dislike the fact that there is only one chat window. Maybe that works for you in your peculiar situation, but the rest of us need a window to communicate in, that's not constantly being flooded by battle spam.<br>
<br>
Finally, the design move that I am most critical of is your inclusion of the 'actions' panel. It takes up a huge amount of space, and (to my knowledge) serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever. Anything the actions panel can do, hotkeys do better. The only thing I use my actions panel for is making new hotkeys; granted, you need it for that. But why keep it open all the time? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamdeathwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sam DeathWalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/30/02 8:43:28 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.nationwidemortgage.com/dm10.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: no seriously</span><hr size=1> Well after over 2000 views finally we get the kind of post I was expecting after 10 views.<br>
<br>
I find the numbers to be a lot more accurate, for example I am killing a mob with my lowbies and need to know when it is under 50percent so that my high level can kill it without worry that the lowbies wont get the exp. With the bar I can't really tell 45 or 50 or 55 percent. With the numbers there is no question. I just don't see the reason behind the bars. I left them on the Group window cause the window has to fit in that space anyway, and I am to tired of working on the interface to remove them, there is no other reason they are worthless to me....<br>
<br>
The target health is extremely clear on my monitor, its just illegible in the jpg conversion I don't know why. I have a 21 inch .22 (yes thats .22 NOT .24 [the FD 500 for those familar with the line]) SONY, you can't belive how clear it is.<br>
<br>
I used to be on the &quot;trade&quot; channel and was watching it all the time but when the bazaar came up I do all my trading that way. I group with myself (4 computers) so I kinda don't really do much talking. I can understand that groups in raid situations would find two windows superior.<br>
<br>
Well the Actions is actually for Socials, I have a ton of Socials as its the only way to really control 4 toons at once. I just put the actions panel up so people would recognize it, its always set to the socials. What do you put on Hot Keys: Socials or Spells. I have all the spells on the spell bar and all the socials in the action box, I only have one right click item (and that right click spell gem refresh exploit doesn't work on most the spells I cast cause they are under 3 seconds anyway) on my warrior and none on my wizards (never got a SoTempFlux) or other toons, so I just don't use the Hot Key box, or whatever hot keys I do use are well Hot Keyed to the keyboard heh.<br>
<br>
This interface is almost totaly for PvE (or PvP) against low level (non raid) mobs. I am sure there will be a time when people are going to load one interface while they are in the bazaar, another for raids, another for pvp and yet another for non raid pve. <br>
<br>
Well top is better if you fight ground mobs, but flying mobs bottom would be better heh..... <br>
<br>
But the key thing is that most important bar with the most important information is right perfect were is should be. You see the mob, you see the info you need, and the Socials are right next to the spell cast bar so mouse movement is a minimum.<br>
<br>
Probably for others, two chat windows, reduction of the Group Box and swapping the HotBox for the ActionsBox would be best....  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/usamdeathwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sam DeathWalker</A> at: 7/30/02 8:45:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ujess221.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jess221</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/31/02 5:12:04 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My Whole UI - The DeathWalker Battle UI!

<br>
YOu want to know Selfish?  You see Rombus' thread on his altered UI files?  Selfish are the 40000+ odd people that went to that thread, downloaded his stuff, without so much as a post saying &quot;nice work! good job!&quot; and just surfed away to another post, yanking what they like from that, then skipping off to another post and yanking what they like from that.  THOSE people are selfish, what's wrong with Sam not wanting to appease the people that just stroll in, take what they want and leave?<br>
<br>
He was looking for advice.  People to tell him what they saw flawed in his UI and what they liked and what he should emphasize on.  Then some <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>SELFISH</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> person comes along (that's probably been spending the last hour picking and choosing his new UI from other threads doing no work of his own, spending no time learning how to work xml) and asks &quot;hey! how come I can't download your stuff so I can take it and leave this thread?&quot;<br>
<br>
The people that just came out of nowhere for the sole purpose of just outright attacking Sam... wtf were you thinking?  That he's being rude for asking for advice?  That's he's rubbing his new UI in our faces when he is basically telling us it's unfinished and wants other peoples opinions of how to make it better?<br>
<br>
In FACT!  I applaud him. He'd rather get advice from him community and peers and the better xml editters than go off, rip another person's work off and integrate it into his own. Sam would rather use his decent xml skils and make one on his own.<br>
<br>
And these people that come in saying it sucks. WHY?!?  Just because you don't like it? Well keep your bloody mouth shut, what are you? 6 years old?<br>
If it sucks tell him WHY!  That's what he wants to know, not hear whatever bullshit you have to spew.<br>

&lt;==EDIT==&gt;<br>
Oh, another couple things. Have you tried not specifying a border style? I was wondering if that would make the windows borderless and fit together better.  Admittedly you would have to change the size of the boxes in the xml since it'd be tough to resize a window with no borders.<br>
<br>
Second, ctrl+D = Disband and ctrl+I = Invite. You don't really NEED those buttons there. Also if you have your actions window open all the time you can just change pages back and invite and disband from there. <p><a target="New" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13385">Master Xarinthus Nihilflare, Nukerer of the 60th</a> <a target="New" Href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=127970">(and 27th)</a> <a target="New" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13385">Degree Burns</a><BR><a target="New" href="http://www.norrathfellowship.com">Norrath Fellowship</a> Quellious<BR><a target="New" href="http://www.circleoflegends.org">Circle of Legends</a> Bristlebane <BR><BR>"Fear the flannel-clad warrior bearing down on you upon a majestic Warmoose. <BR>A chainsaw in one hand, a beaver in the other, I AM CANADIAN!"</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uxarinthus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xarinthus</A> at: 8/4/02 1:03:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uealara.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EalarA</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/4/02 3:01:58 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Are people really this stupid?.</span><hr size=1> no more replys kthx~<br>

<br>
Ya that is true about the band and disband but I running 4 toons at one time and I have to use it a lot... kinda running out of keyboard combos also as I only have one keyboard for all 4 computers.<br>
<br>
Color behind the buffs just makes them harder to read, and covers the game world behind the buff window. The large type face helps in that regard.<br>
