(This is from a 50+ point of veiw)<br>
In a &quot;normal&quot; exp group wizards can out damage anyone in the group......for 1-4 kills, add in snareing, stuning, rooting that drops to 1-2 kills before &quot;oom&quot;. This means that most of us (I think) usually dont burn hard, instead we nuke or rain(Tears Line) once per mob (in my opinion we shouldn't even have the tears line we should have nukes that do that much damage) and conserve mana until a bad pull needs to be burned down, which is a good idea, but thats another point.<br>
<br>
When you have a warrior dual weilding hmm a Frostbringer and a Lammy, I'm sorry but there is no way in hell you are gonna outdamage him unless you can dual rain, and if you actually survive doing that once or twice then you are &quot;lom&quot; and cant do anything else for 10 minutes. This is why wizards are not the class that comes to mind when people are making groups, we simply cannot keep up the same damage as a melee could. I have been asked to join groups and seen groups looking specificly for a wizard, but it is not our nukes that they want, they want snare, stun, and evac, this is fine with me because atleast I can get a group, but it is disapointing. <br>
<br>
Dont get me wrong, I love my wizard, but I would love him even more if he could do what he is supposed to do.<br>
<br>
ps-I detest the Draught line of spells, I didn't ask to be an Uzi, I want to be a Bazooka!<br>

<br>
First......<br>
<br>
To all of you who are bringing up how rouges need groups to do damge.  FINE.  yes I can solo yes rouges can't solo as well, but I DON'T WANT TO SOLO, I WANT TO GROUP.  In most dungeons and non open areas we ALSO NEED GROUPS to do our damge.  So can we just through this lame argument about who needs groups to do damage out the window.<br>
<br>
Second.....<br>
<br>
To all of you who say we have snares, roots, ports, ecetra.  Do you really think becase we have these things it justifies the damage we do?  This game is designed around killing and taking down monsters in GROUPS.  Thats right killing things in groups.  <br>
<br>
It is fear of us becoming better soloists that verant dosn't up our damage output.  If they could somehow nerf our ability to solo and increase our damage output so groups would want us that would be a feat to see.  <br>
<br>
Like many I started my wizard to blow things up not to hunt for groups and play mister utility class.  Utilities are a enchanters area let them do that.  To me doing the damage and getting noticed as a force to be reconed with and SOUGHT after for groups at ALL levels is more important then any utility spell.<br>
<br>
Now on a side note..........<br>
<br>
Hounestly, how many wizards here started their characters to blow things up?  <br>
<br>
Ok how many wizards here are discruntled by the fact other classes think we can't HOLD our own well enuff in exp grinds in comparison to other classes?  <br>
<br>
Ok how many here beleive that some improvements to our ability to blow things up would increse our group ability?  (now when I talk about blowing things up I don't care how its done as long as i can contribute more on a exp grind without THREAT of going OOM without an enchanter present).<br>
<br>
It's hafting to sit a fight out on ocasion to medditate for 5-10 minutes becase the blasted tanks overpulled and we in our zeal to save the group over nuke burning all our mana saving the day leaving us oom, the tanks full life becase of the clerics, and the clerics only healing once or twice becase we burned all our mana.  <br>
<br>
Yes I know this example can be torn apart by saying if the tank is healthy after word, and the cleric still has mana then you shouldn't have overnuked.  Instead you should have looked bad to the group becase while they're working twice as hard to do the same amount of damage you sit there and they think your a lowsie wizard for medditating on an overpull.<br>
<br>
Reason wizards are hated for exp groups is DOWNTIME.  In this game were it takes some people a year or more to hit level 60 if that, people get realy frustrated with downtime.  People veiw medditating wizards as a drag and a exp spunge to their hard work.  We need increased regen or less mana cost on nukes or more damage at same mana cost on nukes to REDUSE our DOWNTIME and bring it more inline with other classes downtime.  Ya sure they might make us even better at soloing but I don't see how that would change the soloing any, it will always be done.  So come on verant give us more power. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=363.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showMessage?topicID=348.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.emailToFriend?topicID=342.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.threadControl?topicID=342.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=342.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=342.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub23.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm1">General Discussion<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm3">Trade Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm4">Rant Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm8">Mob Dropped Spells<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm10">Class Balance & Class Bugs<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm22">Out of Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm27">PVP Forum<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm28">The Library<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm25">Share Your Mana<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm18">Admin<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm19">Soloing<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm20">AE Kiting<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm21">AE Grouping<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm2">General Quests<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm5">Staff of the Four - Epic Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet of the Falinkan<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm23">Duties for the Crown<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm31">Fusibility Research<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm15">Hsagra's Wrath<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm12">Kael Drakkal Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm14">Skyshrine Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm7">Frostbeards Armor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm9">Phenocryst's Focus<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm17">Plane of Sky<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm16">Porlos' Fury<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm13">Rough Silver Chain<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm24">Staff of the Wheel - Ice Comet<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm11">Velium Chill of Al'Kabor<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm6">Tome of Ages Quest<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm29">Translocational Suppressions<option value="graffeswizardcompilationfrm30">Veeshan's Peak Key</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4>Rant Forum</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
