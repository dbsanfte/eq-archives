In most states, you have to be 17 in order to have consensual sex. If you're younger than that, you're breaking the law. Of course the age differs from state to state.<br>
<br>
Yes, killing yourself, by any means is illegal. It's also a mortal sin, which is probably why it was made into a law in the first place.<br>
In practice, you can't punish a person that has committed suicide unless they make a mistake. And if they do survive their attempts, the government has the right to toss them into to jail. Like their life wasn't bad enough, now they're being punished for trying to end their life.<br>
<br>
The only difference between dying of &quot;Natural Causes&quot; and killing yourself is that one takes a little longer. The cause of death is insignificant.  You shoot yourself in the head, BAM, you're done. Pretty quick, although messy. <br>
Or, you could OD from shooting heroin. The effect is the same. The person is dead.<br>
Or you could jump off a tall building. Again, messy, but over quickly. Or you could take pills. Legal pills will kill you just as quickly as illegal pills.<br>
<br>
My point is, we're all going to die. Personally, I'd like to have a choice of what can or cannot kill me.<br>
<br>
For instance, I don't want some asshole to shoot me dead. That, I like being illegal. However if I want to ingest something that will eventually poison me, that's my decision and nobody should be able to tell me differently.<br>
<br>
I wish people would stop being so overly concerned with others, and actually worry about themselves for a change. Of course, that brings us back to victimless crimes.<br>
<br>
Lets say I decide I don't want to live anymore, so I go to the local hardware store, purchase a gallon of turpentine, and begin mixing the turpentine with gator-ade, which I drink outside the hardware store.<br>
Now, as I'm drinking this turpentine cocktail, people are walking in and out of the hardware store giving me looks. <br>
Ok, here's the kicker: According to popular belief, if I drop dead in front of that hardware store, the hardware store is a victim. All the people that witnessed me drinking my turpentine cocktail are victims. Why? Becuase they saw me. They empathized with me, and because I croaked, they now feel bad. Well, I'm sorry, but hurt feelings don't need fucking laws. Natural events don't need laws.<br>
<br>
What we need are laws against unatural events. Shooting someone without that persons consent should be illegal. However, if two idiots want to get up at dawn and face off in a duel, that should be legal. They're both willingly getting up with the intent to kill the other person. If we're lucky, they'll kill each other! If not, well, no insurance coverage for them!<br>
<br>
Flying a plane into a building should be illegal. Planning on flying a plane into a building should be illegal. Talking about flying a plane into a building, even if you're standing in an airport at the time, should not be illegal. Again, talking about flying a plane into a building is a victimless crime. Sure, somebody might get their feelings hurt, but guess what? Nobody cares! I could give a rats ass about how you feel regarding some stupid comment I make.<br>
<br>
Our civilization is being silly. We treat each other like children, and so, we have laws to govern us like children. Nobody takes the time to actually think for themselves any more. Instead they listen to other people and form their opinions based off that.<br>
<br>
Take oil for example. We're dependant on a substance which comes from people we generally don't like, all because we're too scared to say 'Fuck you, I'm growing my gas!'.<br>
The United States could kick it's Oil addiction in less than 5 years. That's right! With just a small modification to your cars fuel systems, you too can drive on Ethanol! <br>
<br>
- It's cheaper than gasoline<br>
- It's cleaner burning than gasoline<br>
- It's a completely renewable source of fuel (Corn)<br>
<br>
The last figures I looked at said that the state of Nebraska could produce enough ethanol for the entire population of the US to drive per year. But instead of allowing our farmers to do their job, we pay our farmers <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not to grow crops</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
Why? Well, because there is so much money in oil, that there's no reason to change. Ethanol would force oil into competition, and oil can't compete with a renewable fuel, because oil isn't a renewable source. Sooner or later, it will run out. So, those in power are basically saying 'Lets make as much as we can off this, and then we'll make money off that later when this runs out!!'.<br>
<br>
Now, let me flip the oil - ethanol problem around so it relates to the Drug War.<br>
We have multi-billion dollar corporations that pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes each year so you don't get a headache. Because they make so much money for the government, the government has deemed these drugs as good, and we're free to use them as long as our doctors say so.<br>
However, there are bad drugs too. Those are drugs that:<br>
<br>
- Won't be as taxable as good drugs<br>
- Will be in direct competition with good drugs<br>
- Are much cheaper to produce than good drugs<br>
<br>
If marijuana was legalized, we'd have not only a new drug with helps with many symptoms, but a new cash crop!<br>
<br>
- Hemp makes fabrics which are stronger and more durable than cotton<br>
- Hemp seed oil can be used for any application that petroleum oil can be used for; from cooking to engine cooling<br>
- Hemp can be ground and made into wood-like products, such as paper, particle board, roofing materials, and even concrete reinforcement. You can literally build a house from marijuana<br>
<br>
Ok, so legalizing weed would bring competition to:<br>
<br>
- The pharmaceutical industries<br>
- The fabrics and clothing industries<br>
- The oil industry<br>
- The lumber &amp; paper mill industries<br>
- The construction industries<br>
<br>
Those are the ones right off the top of my head. I'm sure I'm missing about another 10,000 or so. Of course, you've heard all this before. <br>
Legalizing weed would also desolve roughly 50% of the DEA, and 100% of the DARE program. It would also free 70% of all drug offenders in our prisons, which would directly effect the amount of prison guards and police we need. The War on Drugs, which the government spends $50+ billion a year on, would fall to pieces, and that money could go to the education system, where it really should have been in the first place.<br>
<br>
The problem with America is that we're breeding like rabbits, not educating our children, and forcing the government to think for us. Remember, we're supposed to do the thinking. The government is supposed to represent us, and not the other way around. <p><CENTER>

here here. Hemp already is grown for most of these applications. The problem with popularity with most of these is that Hemp/Cannibus is common-knowledge as an illegal to possess/grow/smoke/eat plant. People who choose to support its use are part of a minority sect of our population, that though if it were completely legal would be supported by a very powerful majority group. <br>
<br>
Many people are afraid to openly be &quot;proud to use hemp products.&quot; but hey. thats how it is. <br>
<br>
Some good points, but these hemp applications are in use, just not as popular as they could be.<br>
<br>

That is bad judgement, and that wouldn't be the drug's fault. If that person splattered the entire 4th grade class, it's still be the person's fault. They can blame the drugs all they want, but they're the dumbasses that took them in the first place.<br>
In a situation like that, it's all about education. You don't just go from having all these drugs illegal to making them legal over-the-counter. They'd be integrated into the populations slowly, and would have limited public advertisement. You wouldn't see weed commercials on television.<br>
<br>
Another thing that would have to be done would be to differentiate &quot;Hard Legal&quot; drugs from &quot;Soft Legal&quot; drugs. <br>
Hard legal drugs would be available only via subscription from a doctor, and would be limited to private residence only use.<br>
<br>
Soft legal drugs, like Alcohol, Tobacco, Caffeine, and Marijuana, would be sold where those products are sold now; convenience stores, bars, cafes, and other venues.<br>
<br>
If I were king of the world, legal consumption age for soft drugs would be 18 for Tobacco, Marijuana and Caffeine, and 21 for Alcohol.<br>
It would be a misdemeanor to consume any soft drugs in public places unless the venue obtained a license and was properly insured.<br>
Driving while intoxicated would relate to all soft drugs. That means no smoking, caffeine or alcohol while operating any mechanical equipment (that means cars too).<br>
All drugs would be heavily taxed, and the money fro those taxes would go towards addiction treatment centers, and the education system.<br>
<br>
It'd be good to be the king. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrindel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grindel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>High Priest of HLS</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/10/02 7:29:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1267.topic&index=135>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/grindel/elminster.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All drugs should be legally available</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I didn't realize there was a lot of date raping going on.

<br>
There are some drugs whose entire reason for existence is to be a detriment to others.  Date rape drugs are an example.  If my daughter decides to go to a club tonight I don't want to have to worry that some horny dumbass has gone to 7-11 and bought himself a mickey so he can rape her.  Another example is truth serum.  Should truth serum be available to whoever wants it?  If your parents are assuming you're lying about something, how'd you like to get a syringe stuck in you so they'd &quot;know for sure&quot;?<br>
<br>
Also are you planning on creating a nation of pharmacists?  Do you have any idea about drug interaction?  Please take some time to think this through, outside of &quot;man it would be cool if I could get whatever drug I wanted whenever I wanted&quot;.<br>

Buddy, all drugs impare judgement. And just about every drug, legal or otherwise, can be used as a date-rape drug. Even Caffeine.

No. No, you can't. There's a really big difference between something designed to affect a single individual, and something caused to cause mass destruction.<br>

In Jarnin's example, an individual took a drug that impares their judgement, and then commited a crime that they would have been capable of even without the drug.<br>
<br>
In your (ridiculous) example, an individual has obtained a substance with the expressed intent of causing mass harm. Unlike what the DARE and other drug programs would have you believe, smoking a joint is not as bad as setting off a nuke in Washington.<br>

You've gone from the simply misinformed to the outright ridiculous. You speak as though society would crumble in its entirety by legalizing a few drugs. God, man. Wake up. Has it ocurred to you that they can integrate these drugs without rebuilding the world? Make a few simple provisions. Hard drugs by prescription only, and only at HOSPITALS. Soft drugs. Well, they can have bars for stuff like that.<br>
<br>
Hey wait! There's a country that's already done that! Did you know that &quot;addiction&quot; is a valid reason to get a prescription for heroine at a hospital in Denmark? Or that there's hash/hemp bars there?<br>
<br>
Did you also know that there's government-made, medical-grade heroine already being LEGALLY consumed and stored at hospitals in the USA and Canada? It's not a great stretch for 90% of those drugs currently illegal to simply include &quot;addiction&quot; as a valid reason to get a prescription, and it would keep people from getting the laced crap on the streets. I can guarantee you that the stuff they have at hospitals is better quality. These drugs are ALREADY legal for medicinal use. Examples of these drugs that the government is already producing and licenses are: Heroine, Morphine, Amphetamines, Marijuana, Cocaine, PCP, XTC, and several others.<br>

It seems like you're arguing that illegal recreational drugs should be available through prescriptions generally, or over the counter if they're deemed &quot;safe&quot; enough by somebody.  Do I understand your perspective correctly, Aurianne?  In general I could get behind this, except there are some public well-being issues and some drugs (like I'd mentioned earlier) that have no business being widely available.

I'm certainly not closed to the idea of making a few drugs illegal, like the date-rape drug Grindel mentions.  But we might run into the same trap we're already in.  If we make a drug (of any kind) illegal, we create a black-market.  Those who really want to get their hands on the drug will do so.  So let's leave those people aside.<br>
<br>
Your argument implies that there are some people just waiting to rape someone if they could just get their hands on the date-rape drug, Grindel.  A similar argument was put forward by supporters of alcohol Prohibition, which implied that if alcohol was legalized again there would be a surge in the number of alcoholics.

Since society has deemed that taking reproductive gratification by force (I'm very, very, sorry for sterilizing the word rape here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) is not in the best interest of society, it is the responsibility of that society to uphold this rule to the best of its ability.  One way to do this is to outlaw possession or use of that particular drug.  Societal (Not social, dammit!  I want my royalties!) Utility determines that it is in the best interest to allow for potential abuses due to alcohol but not for potential abuses due to more specific date rape drugs.<br>

I think you give people too much credit. A lot of these laws are preventative in nature. They were made for a reason, not just to infringe upon your personal freedom. You have a responsibility to society, and that responsibility entails more than just pleasuring yourself. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uclaudshadowflare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ClaudShadowflare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/10/02 1:07:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1267.topic&index=147>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All drugs should be legally available</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You have a responsibility to society, and that responsibility entails more than just pleasuring yourself.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

There's no way in hell we'd EVER legalize all drugs- we owe that much to society at least to keep the more dangerous ones locked away as best we can.  Outside of marijuana, I can't see many other drugs that would be legalized.  &quot;Legalizing&quot; marijuana isn't a word I like to use either; I'd rather see it &quot;decriminalized&quot;, so that being caught with an eighth wouldn't be a reason to spend the night in the county.  &quot;Legalization&quot; would lead to less potent dope and high taxes on it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubrahmaatman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brahma Atman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer<BR>Leopa's Biotch</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(7/10/02 1:16:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1267.topic&index=148>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: All drugs should be legally available</span><hr size=1> Grindel wrote:<br>

So you feel that if there were no legal impediment to rape, then we'd live in a society loaded with instances of rape?  Be careful of what you're saying here.  You're saying that the biological imperative to reproduce is so strong that it's likely that one person would rape another if they felt they could get away with it.  I don't think this imperative is as strong as you set out here.  For that reason, I don't believe that there would be a &quot;rape epidemic&quot; in the wake of legalizing a date-rape drug.  I'll take this opportunity to say that I'm still undecided on date-rape drugs, which don't conveniently fit into the recreational or medicinal categories.<br>

No, Nintendo-War in the Gulf and police actions in Grenada don't count.  In the complete absence of moral guidance, yes reproductive imperatives in men often take precedence and you have exploitation and rape of women.<br>
