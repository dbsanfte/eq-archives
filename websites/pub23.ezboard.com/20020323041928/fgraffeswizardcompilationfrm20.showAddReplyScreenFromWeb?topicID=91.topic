I think I made 40 on Saturday, so it took five days or so to get through 40 HELL.  I suppose I could have done it faster, but I wasn't in any huge rush.<br>
<br>
I've spent a lot of time quad-kiting Ulthorks in EW at the site directly North/NorthWest of the bridge along the coast.<br>
<br>
There is some sort of giant controlled struction there too.  I noticed a Frost Giant Prison Guard and such.  I don't know what that's about.<br>
<br>
Also, I've been trying to find and kill the Ulthork Man-o-War.  I've never seen him.  Anyone know where he can be found?<br>
<br>
Ulthork Hunters are very easy to quad-kite.  The biggest problem with them is getting four at a time.  If it's foggy and snowy, it's hard to find any Ulthorks at all sometimes.   The Hunters have low HP.  Three CoF and they're ready for their final rest.<br>
<br>
Ulthork Warriors have more HP.  I found at 40 I couldn't quite fully quad Warriors.  I would end up with one or more warrior unsnared chasing me and me OOM with no Harvest.<br>
<br>
Maybe at 41 I can do better.  I've had three Hunters and one Warrior go okay because I have enough mana after the Hunters die to finish the Warrior.<br>
<br>
I've found that I will grab four Ulthorks of various sorts and have ended up with six critters all in a bunch.  To my surprise, BoF does *not* snare more than four at a time.  For some reason, I thought BoF was unlimited.  No.  It only works on four at once.<br>
<br>
Having three Hunters, two Warriors, and an angry Walrus running after you can be a lot of fun, but I've found I only get one or maybe two kills out of this by the time I resnare and regroup all the times required.  <br>
<br>
Yesterday, I ran two Warriors to a guild-mate at the Orc fort.  I got XP for one they killed but the other had almost full health, so I didn't get XP for that.  Oh well.<br>
<br>
Another guild-mate, a level 42'ish Enchanter, joined me last night for a couple quads before I logged.  He gave me clarity and some other buffs (why do they insist on the Wisdom buff?  I don't know?).  <br>
<br>
I brought in three Warriors and we easily finished them.  Then, I brought in four Hunters and asked him to G'Flux them (his only useful AoE) just because I wanted him to participate.   His G'Flux killed two and I finished the other two with a final CoF. <br>
<br>
My Enchanter bud was telling me I was his &quot;hero&quot; and he was bowing before me.  Hee hee.  That's probably the first true quad-kite he's ever seen.  What a riot.<br>
<br>
Earlier in the day, I had two warriors I was quad-kiting and I passed this little halfling druid.  I said, &quot;Hey bud!&quot;<br>
<br>
He rooted a warrior.  What?  Finally, I finished them but it was messy.  I yelled at him.  He told me that he was only helping me because I asked.  Ugh.  Lesson:  Don't talk to anyone when you're multi-kiting.  They may misunderstand you and try to help.  <br>
<br>
At least, don't use words that begin with &quot;h&quot; -- Hello, Howdy, Hey, Hi, etc.  They look like Help.  I guess.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah.  I finally found the Blood Drakkel Wolf out in GD.  I ran out to do a simple multi-kite while waiting on the droooed I had grouped with to find more people for a giant killing group.<br>
<br>
I saw one dire wolf and agro'd it with my staff.  Hey another.  Agro.  Run, group, snare.  One resisted.  Snare.  Resist.  Snare.  Resist.  What?<br>
<br>
It's the Blood!  Woot!  Harness and Broodmother quest!  I snared finally.  Nuked the poo poo out of it.  The Blood has more HP than a Frost Giant Scout.  Probably about twice as much.  So, I was OOM and the Blood was no longer snared with 1/3 of it's health still there.<br>
<br>
Rather than lose it, I called on the drooed who is 50+ to come and assist.<br>
<br>
She did and got the harness.  She said she nuked it for three 600+ DD's before it died.  Massive HP.  Well, I did let her keep the harness since she was a drooooeeed.  I don't really need it.  I was totally surprised to find the Blood because I've probably killed over 100 Drakkel Dires and never once seen it before.<br>
<br>
I'll do Ulthorks and Gianst for a while now.  I plan to slip into Kael tonight and hit the Giants with my Staff of Temp Flux whilst a raid is going on simply for faction.  Hopefully, I'll get Indiff+ with CoV soon.<br>
<br>
I need to check out Emerald Jungle sometime soon just to see what it's like.  I want to kill Ulthorks for the tusks and armor for a while too.  I've found three gloves and lots of bracers and velium weapons.  I have close to a stack of meat which is used by for the third shawl quest anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><br><font color=#ffffff>- </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation>Graffë's Wizard Discussion</a><font color=#ffffff> - </font><a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm20>AE Kiting</a> <font color=#ffffff> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.4<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
