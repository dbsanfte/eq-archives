<br>
I thought you were trying to back away from this, and was trying to let you off the hook before. My mistake.<br>
<br>
The crime is more worthy of prosecution because it is being prosecuted twice. It is clearly worthy of multiple prosecution.<br>
<br>
You can't get around this. There is either two crimes. One, murder, and one hate. Or there is one crime, which is prosecuted under two statutes. It's not the first because an emotion being a crime would be tossed out of any court in the land, so it's the second.<br>
<br>
One crime.<br>
<br>
Multiply prosecuted.<br>

If this is true you can't do the latter without doing the former.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If identifying social norms regarding crimes of hate, and raising the bar on punishment (from perhaps 0!) for these crimes, takes a few people and drives home the point that it might be better to hold their rage inside instead of beat some random person to death, then society is served by having the laws on the books. - Grindel<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
An impassioned person would not stop to be concerned. A calmer person whose true motive was 'hate' would take the time to make it appear like hate was not the motive, which is not to hard to do. Motive is a hard thing to prove in the first place.<br>

First it's not lust (so we've been told) and second hate crime does not make any activity illegal that was not already illegal. So the word anarchy is misused here. There are laws already.<br>

<br>
Exactly the problem. We DO all mostly agree that crimes against children or worse than against adults.<br>
<br>
However we do NOT agree that crimes against gay people are worse than against straights. It's unamerican and unethical  for it to be more wrong for one adult to be victimized than another adult.<br>

Quite right, and it never has worked. Worse unjust laws undermine the whole judicial system, as these do. There must be some buy in by the people or they will start to see the rules as unfair and arbitrary and merely something to get around. This has already happenned to great extent to to the underclasses. Rich people get off, poor people go to jail, OJ, Marion Barry, politicians do coke, some poor schmuck gets caught with a bag and goes to jail for years.. the system stinks thru and thru as far as they are concerned.. and they are right. Hate crimes are a blatant use of the judicial system for political reasons, and as such does not bother the people <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> already</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> judicially disenfranchised (they see it as business as usual) or the upper class (they always knew they were priveleged) but the middle class, who like to believe things are fair, see this as a big huge deal.<br>
<br>
I submit to you its a REALLY bad idea to let the middle class start to think that the law is unjust. And color it anyway you want, but saying murder is bad, but murdering a gay person (or whoever) is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> worse</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is perspicuously unjust.<br>
<br>
There is another power government has that DOES work to affect social change.<br>
<br>
But the judiciary should not be used in this manner. The systems integrity is basically what underwrites a law. If you make bad laws, you compromise the only resource you really have, that integrity. The valuation of society for the justness of the legal system has a big impact. Ultimately it is a core reason why governments, and the societies upon whom they feed, become senescent.<br>

Defacing personal property is bad, but it's much worse when you deface that property with the intent to terrorize a particular group of people.<br>
<br>
It's society's way of saying that it sucks to beat up a guy who looks at you wrong (whether the person is gay or straight or whatever) but it's even worse to go cruising to find a gay person to beat up simply because you hate gay people.  And I'm sorry but I cannot see what is wrong with raising the 'barrier of entry' to a hate crime by raising the bar on punishment.<br>

If lawyers are using the law for purposes beyond what the original idea was then you blame the writers of the law and amend it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ubrahmaatman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brahma Atman</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/7/02 2:05:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1111.topic&index=83>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: My opinion is drivel</span><hr size=1> Grindel wrote:<br>

Isn't a hate crime a crime of passion, in a sense?  If so, then hate crimes are no different and, therefore, aren't worse.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

What if we applied this kind of logic to robbery?  Let's see, shall we?  It might go something like this...<br>
<br>
It sucks to steal from a guy for no good reason.  It is even worse to go cruising for a rich person to steal from just because they have more money.  In this example, rich people are a minority who are targetted because the thief hates that they have more money than him.  So, stealing from the rich beause you hate them would be more punishable than stealing from the poor, whom you like.<br>

I think we're all on the same side here, guys. The overall sense Im getting from all this is everyone should be treated as equals regardless of sexual preference, class, or creed. As far as I can see, this reflects everyones opinion, and if Im wrong then I'm sorry. In the meantime, what are we arguing over?<br>
<br>
As far as Faithkills/Freddie thing goes, posting under an assumed name is retarded, and while I've known FK to be a jerk, never known him to stoop to such a pointless level. And he's made some good discussion here.
