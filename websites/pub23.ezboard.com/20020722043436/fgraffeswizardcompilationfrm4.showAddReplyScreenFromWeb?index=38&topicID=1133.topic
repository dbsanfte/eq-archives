And LaSorcier had a good point. I got my car stuck in a ditch (long story), and was trying to dig it out. After about an hour, I was desperate, and just started praying. I felt better.

This sentence really bothers me. From my understanding it is not only the atheists who oppose the idea of prayer in school. The problem was that it was the Christian God who was being prayed to and other religions were not being properly represented as well.<br>

This sentence reinforces my idea that religion really came about because people were trying to explain forces of nature that they couldn't understand. Putting a human face on that force, or at least giving that force a name, and worsipping it does not mean that the force has any sort of conciousness and will recognize the act of worship.<br>

My pleasure. I am glad you enjoyed it. Although I've got to say that the ending was probably one of my favorite parts. The end is supremely disturbing and although I don't really agree with his description of what we are I think it does put a lot of things (ideas/beliefs) into perspective. Perhaps he went a bit too far though.<br>

My reason is that teh Universe is about to become aware (and with about I mean in a couple of billion years....). Thought: Our brains are composed of LOTS of cells, internet is composed of LOTS of 'brains' (humans interacting). Now we just assume that there is other civilizations out there whom also has some technology for communication over long distances. As we grov more advanced we will begin to communicate with these people and thereby expanding the 'collective brain' until it encompasses a arther big part of the Universe. Since every cell in your head is quite unaware of the brain, and the brain (from a purely 'organic' point of view) is unawareof the internet, so will we be unaware of the consciousness of the Universe.

I'd have to disagree with this statement.  There are probably as many religious people (Christians in this area) who are yelling and moaning that the Teacher can't get in front of the class and say &quot;Let us Pray&quot; as there are Non-religious people arguing with them saying We don't WANT to pray in school.<br>
<br>
Personally I wouldn't mind a study in Comparitive religion, meaning take As many of the currently practiced religions in the world (hell take the beliefs of the Romans, and Greeks too) and teach as a science the differences and similarities to each other.  Teaching about religion and teaching religion are two entirely different subjects.  That I think is the main complaint with &quot;Prayer in the Schools&quot; it is seen as proselytizing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugrindel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grindel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Sorcerer</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/14/02 7:11:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.cox.net/grindel/elminster.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God and Religion (OT)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Do we need to distinguish between God and Gravity?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Bah, the Creator is gravity, or more aptly gravity is a reflection of the Creator that we can sense.

<br>
Slightly changing topics, science and theology combine easily for me.  I have no problem with the notion that a logical Creator would create a universe based on specific rules (many of which we don't have clue #1 about).  God creates Man, but uses several million years of evolution to do it.  In another several million years, provided we haven't exterminated ourselves first (or maybe BECAUSE we have) God will have created some other species.  Hopefully a more enlightened one than this one.  We are arrogant to believe we are the acme of creation.  Or that we have the tools to see more than the tiniest sliver of what is around us.  We can directly sense a small sliver of what, four dimensions around us?  We are blind.<br>
<br>
The Bible says that the universe was created in a week.  So what?  It also says that a year to God is as 1000 (think unfathomable number based on Judaic culture at that time) to man.  So that week translates to 12 billion years.  Where's the problem?  I laugh nearly my deepest guffaws at people who believe the world is 3,000 years old and that fossils are the devil trying to pursuade us otherwise <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   What do we lose in faith by viewing it alongside science?

There's beer in hell? Woohoo!! Seriously though (or facetiously, whichever works) I figured it's a rant forum and I had to rant at someone. *wink*<br>
<br>
On the topic of prayer in schools: prayer is an individual activity which can just as easily occur in the silence and privacy of one's own mind as anywhere else. There is no way to ban prayer in school. If a child wishes to pray, she may do so at any moment no matter what else is going on.<br>
<br>
What was banned, and I'm completely in favor of the ban, was the practice of organized prayer in schools. Children of different faith, and children of no particular faith, were made to feel different unless they conformed and bowed their little heads and folded their little hands and pretended to be what they were in fact not...Christians. <br>
<br>
If the Christian population wants classtime designated for organized prayer for each faith represented by the class population, as well as some private time for non-prayer on the part of those who don't hold a particular faith, then I'd suggest they need to think about how much class time that's going to waste. I find it odd that anyone who believes in the Christian god might expect that He can't or won't hear a child's prayer because it comes from the heart unaccompanied by genuflections or gestures. <br>
