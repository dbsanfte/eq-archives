How to get your Staff of the Wheel on Sullon Zek<br>
<br>
I thought I'd give my perspective on this as I am on a PvP server (Sullon) which should make this more difficult. Apart from not having any wolf form (no druids on team evil), it isn't. I would suggest waiting until you get your first round of gates at 19, as that makes for a lot less running.<br>
<br>
Neriak - Duh, I'm a dark elf. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  If you aren't evil, well... good luck. Leave everything in the bank, invis and run in. If I were good or nuet, I would do this one after getting gate at 4th. Have a high level friend invis you outside of the city, and run in, gate out. I can't think of any other way unless you are really high level as this is the major hub of evil.<br>
<br>
Oasis - No problem here, invis and swim out towards the island. I started in the SE corner as that is easiest. There were only 2 goblins in the tower and they were both non-casters that couldn't see through invis. I guess I got lucky on this one. Since evil OWNS the desert, good/nuet should try zoning in halfway between the cliffs and the water from Northern Ro. Dodge SG's until you get to the lake, either side of the zone will have lots of evils that will raise the red flag, but the middle is rarely populated. Heck, those that are there are too busy dodging SG's to con you.<br>
<br>
Dagnor's - very easy to find, still had enduring breath from Oasis. I would definitely advise doing this and Unrest during non-peak hours if you are on the evil team. Even so, since good/nuet think they own these, they will rarely have see invis up. I had all chat channels on and no one even bothered to announce my arrival.<br>
<br>
Unrest - Appart from being a good/nuet controlled zone, this was very simple. If you are on team evil, please feel free to shout insults as you gate away. : )<br>
<br>
Lake Rathe - Ok, this one scared the bejezus out of me. It is a LONG tunnel and visibility is poor. Enduring breath or equivelant is MANDATORY, regardless of swim skill. I would stay high in the tunnel as there are several gobs that will be sitting on the floor (it is a big tunnel as well as long, so just swim over them). The good news is, unlike Oasis, this rod spawns within reach of the window. My tower had 2 non-casters and 1 see invis caster on the top floor, but by simply floating past the appropriate window and grabbing it, I was ok. Be careful where you pause to gate out, since there are gobs on the floor of the main hall, I would suggest swimming a ways back down the tunnel until you find a clear spot. Above all, keep that invis up! Factionally, this should be no problem as there are few people in this zone, and they aren't likely to cross your path while in the water. <p><img src=http://www.houselokri.com/banners/diedresig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/udiedrelokri.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Diedre Lok ri</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Apprentice</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/15/01 6:55:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to get your staff on Sullon Zek</span><hr size=1> PART II<br>
How to get your Staff of the Wheel on Sullon Zek<br>
<br>
Qeynos- Get SoW before you go as it is always a long run through West Karana. I stayed clear of the roads, and though there were many nuets in the zone, I saw none except right before zoning into Qeynos hills. Be certain to print a map of the aqueducts if you are unfamiliar with them. I did run into a slight problem with nuetral pk's hunting the aqueducts. However, with a judicious application of flame and root, the problem went away. Nuet should have no problem, Good's aught to be able to do this one as well.<br>
<br>
Erud's Crossing- Obviously this is a good one to do right after Qeynos, as has been mentioned, there are no sharks at this time. Everyone on the island was nuetral, but they were all considerably lower level than 22. It is possible that there are still sharks on the East side of the island, so don't jump out of the boat before you get there. If you do, be sure to camp to eliminate agro before you go looking for the rod. Don't worry about the zombies. There is no reason you should get anywhere near their agro range. Same as the previous on the Good/nuet aspect.<br>
<br>
Highpass hold- By now, your sow from the previous two has faded. If you are evil, gate back to somewhere and bank your rods because this one may be challenging. I refreshed SoW and gated back in to North Karana, not a whole lot of people there. East Karana and the Pass are obviously inundated with nuets... 50 in each zone by my count. Let's just say I got damn luck and the only person I passed on the ramp was a level 6 who saw me, but didn't raise the alarm. As evil or good, I would do this one during non peak hours, but I was getting impatient. I'm begining to thing Nuet really has it made on this quest.<br>
<br>
Guk- Had my swimming skill been better, this would have been the only one I died on. Knowing what I know now, I would probably only died here once instead of 5 times. Get a friend with invis vs undead, you will not be able to do this without it. I would suggest taking either of the water routes into dead lower guk. If you are nuet or good, this is evil turf. However, this shouldn't be too difficult as most of the people hunting in upper guk are not going to be able to follow you without invis on. The frogs are more on your side than you know. Once you reach lower Guk, leave your friend in the water area where the 2 underwater tunnels meet and get invis vs undead on. As mentioned elsewhere, if you stay on the left wall through the bat room (first room off the bedroom) and then on the right wall through the GBS room, you won't agro anything. Just don't stop moving and be very sure you take the left passage out of the bedoom (otherwise you will end up in the middle of the bat room instead of left side, eep!) After passing the GBS room, jump down off the left side of the bridge. There are plenty of maps that will lead you from this point, and in 5 runs I saw nothing but undead between here and the hand room. You'll know you've gotten to the right place when the ceiling is made of water, walk up the wall and swim up. The hand blasts for 250 a pop, and his friend will finish you if that doesn't (remember you've had to fall a bit and don't have time to rest of see invis goes away). I died here many times the moment I left the water until I had a brilliant flash of insight. The mobs don't aggro on you until you step out of the water, and it turns out the rod is pretty close to the water. By being careful not to step on the shore, I swam over to the edge and grabbed the rod. Damn, it had to be that easy didn't it?<br>
<br>
Everfrost- Being the crazy, and rather brazenly bold evils that we are, we used the firepots to port into Halas. This is do-GOOD-er central, but you shouldn't see anyone high enough to see through unvis until you hit the open plains east of the mountians. Sadly, my cohort did not have the swimming skill to survive the trip under the ice, so I did not have invis vs. undead to help me with the skellies. In retrospect I would have bound on one of the ridges on the north side of the zone (there are several places you can run up the zone wall) I didn't think of this until I was already down there, so I bound at the cave entrance. I ended up rooting the skellies, grabing the rod and gating back out (to avoid the mean necro) however I drowned on my way out with skill of 105, inches from the ice hole. Would have made it, but the skellies had beaten me up a bit. Ah well, no exp loss there. This should be easy if you are on team good, and nuet shouldn't have too much trouble either.<br>
<br>
That's it, you're there! You win!<br>
<br>
Some tips that I've picked up along the way:<br>
<br>
None of the barbarians hanging out with Sulgar will agro on an evil dark elf wizard with default faction.<br>
<br>
NPCs will not respond to quest prompts if you are invis.<br>
<br>
To start the quest, say &quot;What about Tarton Wheel&quot; without any 's' or ' in Tarton's.<br>
<br>
Spend the 10 pp to buy sow/enduring breath when you need it.<br>
<br>
Don't even THINK about scouting Lower Guk without invis vs. undead.<br>
<br>
Always insult the opposing team on your way out the door.<br>
<br>
Try to do the parts that are in enemy territory during off peak hours.<br>
<br>
In many situations you can get the rod you want without aggroing the mobs. If in a tower try not to enter the tower, in guk, don't get out of the water.<br>
<br>
Don't try to melee a mob with your new staff. The 100 delay is NOT a misprint.<br>
<br>
Identify the items you get! The spell only costs 9 pp and will save you hours if you accidentally got one of the wrong rods.<br>
<br>
I had a much easier time of this than expected given the pvp status of my server. Even though many of the rods were in enemy territory, I was only attacked once, and that was only because I didn't have invis up. With the very notable exceptions of the Guk and Neriak rods, good/nuetral should have a relatively easy time of it as well. I have to say this was the most fun quest I've ever been on.<br>
<br>
Good luck to those who need it, and many thanks to those who helped! <p><img src=http://www.houselokri.com/banners/diedresig.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ugoramon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goramon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/23/01 8:41:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: How to get your staff on Sullon Zek</span><hr size=1> Very nice post indeed.  /applaud<br>
