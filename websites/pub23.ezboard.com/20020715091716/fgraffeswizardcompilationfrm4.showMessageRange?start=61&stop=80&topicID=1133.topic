Yes. The difference is, the scientist calls it a &quot;theory&quot; and, if he's an honest scientist, refines or revises it as new evidence comes in. The theist, on the other hand, calls it &quot;revelation&quot; (or divine truth, or epiphany or some such) and tends to think it's eternal...and that it's worth killing people who don't agree. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uoglzogl.showPublicProfile?language=EN>oglzogl</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/02 3:55:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God and Religion (OT)</span><hr size=1> The thing is.. if a theory happens to be good science then anybody could understand (well, maybe some theories are too abstract for most of us.

<br>
Darwin didn't just pull the theory of evolution out of his rump. The conclusion came from years of observation.<br>
<br>
Relativity might have been an insight for Einstien while traveling on a train but he had to prove that the physical laws were constant.<br>
<br>
Look at how many things we, as a species, have been able to create because of our theories.<br>
<br>
Sure, we don't know everything. We have theories. But pure science requires the scientific method. That means that anybody should be able to test a theory (with proper funding I suppose <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) and understand the conclusion. If the conclusion is not consistent, it is scrapped.<br>
<br>
Religion on the other hand is completely untestable. You have one man who talks to a burning bush. The bush won't talk, let alone ignite, for anybody else. How do you test that?<br>

I do believe in Jesus, I do believe he is true man and true God.  <br>
<br>
I am a 100 percent christian.  I won't try to change anyones mind, I won't put you down for what your beliefs are. I am not a christian by todays standards but one of old times.  Organized religion(the religion of today) is a greedy money hungry organization in my eyes.  A true christian Lives life, and does what is right, not because the bible says so, but because they know inside them it is right.(you do by instinct, because it is ingrained in your soul, it is part of you)  I don't preach to others anymore, I let my actions in my life speak for themselves.  <br>
<br>
The bible says in the end times(if we are living in them now) everyones path has been choosen already.  There is no amount of preaching that will convert someone from religion, or to religion. (By reading this thread and looking at the world as it is now, I see this could have come to pass already)<br>
<br>
I don't believe in killing for religion as everyone is looking at overseas.  Killing is wrong any way you put it, and in my eyes america is just as guilty as the other countries, because our solution to everything is blow it up.  No country is innocent.  Here is a good saying for you. Evil begets evil, good begets good.  If a person swears at you and you continue to walk away, it is usually the end of it.  If you swear back it usually ends up in a fight.(Evil bringing out evil, it feeds on itself)  Just as the war the world is into now, we are feeding that evil and so will all the other countries.<br>
<br>
My saying in the end is: To each his own.  <br>
<br>
These our my own beliefs, I mean no ill-malice to anyone by my words, live your life in what makes you happy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/umandari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mandari</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.nc.rr.com/prismites/icon1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Channeler</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/16/02 5:11:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=66>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.nc.rr.com/prismites/icon1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God and Religion (OT)</span><hr size=1> Eamin:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;The &quot;evidence&quot; against religion is not really that convincing, it can be bent any way possible.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Evidence *against* religion isn't really the point; it's not something anyone is compelled to provide. It is the responsibility of the religious practitioner to provide evidence of the truth of their beliefs, if they so choose.  Anyone can come up with a religious claim.  If they care to be taken seriously by skeptics they must do what scientists do: provide evidence. And thus far the evidence is woefully insufficient.<br>
<br>
There is a way to give evidence against religion, though it's a matter of philosophy.  If you make specific claims about a god's attributes, and it can be shown that those attributes are paradoxical or not in line with what we observe on earth, then that version of god is falsified.  Theodore Drange does this quite thoroughly to a common conception of god in &quot;Nonbelief &amp; Evil&quot;<br>
<br>
I've read up on most of the statistics of the Big Bang, and nothing about it says &quot;There is no God.&quot; It's how you choose to interpret it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I agree.  The Big Bang is science and not meant as any disproof of religion.  It's certainly very easy for someone to match &quot;Let there be light!&quot; with the Big Bang.  Pre- and post Big Bang there are problems, however.<br>
<br>
Evantine:<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Science has a few theories, and so does religion. But it's all faith, whether it be faith in some creator or faith that it was some chemical soup/sheer coincidence. There's been absolutley no evidence of anything from that time.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Either you're not paying attention or your science teacher should be flogged. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   First, the terms &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;faith&quot; are best kept tied to science and religion, respectively.  Theologians may theorize on religious matters, but it has little in common with the empirical and mathematical evidence used to explain observations (a scientific theory). Likewise, if a scientist has faith in his results, it's due to the replication of observations in controlled settings or the natural world. Religious faith is more akin to belief in a certain set of circumstandes *despite* lack of replication.<br>
<br>
I write too much as is, so I'll just provide one piece of evidence for science's current understanding of the early universe. Cosmic background radiation distribution is in line with the inflationary model of the early universe.  That may not sound like much, but without it the Big Bang would go the way of Einstein's fated &quot;cosmological constant.&quot;  Cheers,<br>

<br>
Bear with me on my ramblings for a moment.<br>
<br>
-------------<br>
<br>
Grow up, we are all children of God. Taking this into account and look at it from a widely accepted religious view point. <br>
<br>
Several religious books say in some way or another that we are all Children of God. Adam/Eve, Jezus as son of God, etc. But what does being a child really mean?<br>
<br>
Being a child means that you are still growing up, growing up with the potential to become like your parent, or even further. This statement indicates that humans have the potential to become God themselves. <br>
<br>
If this holds any thruth, which is does in my vision, The human race is in his development just coming of the nipple, walking around in diapers and saying No every time and doing things it isn't supposed to do. We have had our first correctional slap. and we are rebelious against our parent.<br>
<br>
The common consensus among every major Religion sofar is that the 10 rules Mozes took down from the mountain contain some very primary guidelines that when followed let people live together and prosper.<br>
<br>
All rules that came afterwards are, when looked at it scientifically, local life/society rules that keep the people healthy where they are. <br>
*no pig meat, because it rots and spreads deseases when exposed. <br>
*6 years working on the land, 7th year it must lay barren, because this prevents desert forming <br>
*6 days work, a 7th day rest. This helps peoples mind unwind, make social contacts and bind them together as one people and they live longer. <br>
*circumsicion (for males), prevents deseases in hot countries where there is not much personal hygiene due to lack of water, keeps your people reproducing. <br>
*No sex before marriage, you need a marriage to secure the pregnant women and infants with  food and shelter, so no pregnancies before they are married. <br>
*no anti-conception, makes sure that your people breed large and spread ''the word''. <br>
*No alcohol, drunk people can not control themselves and are therefore a threat to the group.<br>
*and more<br>
<br>
These rules became common heritage to people and religion up to te point where the rules were more important than the reason they were added to the religions.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, people are starting to look around again, they want to break away from the confinement of there parents religion. This results in alot of searching people. Some of those people will be brainwashed by a charismatic person that looks as if he knows what he is talking about. Others are born into communities and are indoctrinated from childhood on into believing beyond any logic or doubt one line of thought. It is sometimes vary scary and very sad to hear those people, and you can not discuss with them because they are 'right'and you are going to hell to even suggest otherwise.<br>
<br>
Some famous religion vs science clashes came out of this. darwin with evolution. <br>
<br>
Coopernicus with saying the earth was not the center of the universe and then saying that therefore the Bible was wrong. (My personal view is that I am the center of the universe, because in an infinite Universe, every direction away from me is the same length)<br>
<br>
Science is based on Theory and measurement. (facts?)<br>
Religion is based on Believe and convincing. <br>
<br>
Scientists Believe there was a reason for the Big Bang, and the first single cell life.<br>
<br>
Religion has a Theory that God did this.<br>
<br>
I think I can become enlightend enough to be god, provided I had had my education by a society not far from that point themself. (Gestald?) Bhudda is seen as an exsample of a man further along the path of becoming god compared to others. And Jezus Christ was sent by God as an exsample for us of what the next step for us would be.<br>

<br>
Widely accepted now, perhaps, though with innumerable variations on what that god might be.  Personally, I consider true &quot;growing up&quot; to involve, in part, dispensing with gods and other superstitions.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt; The common consensus among every major Religion sofar is that the 10 rules Mozes took down from the mountain contain some very primary guidelines that when followed let people live together and prosper.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Actually, there were -- I believe -- 312 rules Moses brought down from the mountain.  You can read about them in Exodus, Leviticus, and Dueteronomy.  Did you know it's a sin to wear a garment made from 2 different types of cloth?  <br>
<br>
Things like 'thou shalt not kill' hardly originate with the 10 commandments; it's a common rule among many cultures, at least when dealing with members of that culture.  In any case, that particular rule is broken multiple times in the OT (and not simply because the chosen people came under attack).  Also, the 10 were later subverted by Jesus and obviated by Paul.  &quot;Thou shalt not worship graven images&quot; expresses intolerance toward cultures that do so; hardly the way to get people to live together and prosper (same with rules on slavery).<br>
<br>
All of your examples are faulty in one way or another.  A divine author surely would have greater sense than to give such advice!  Simply advising followers to bathe regularly would have proactively solved many problems and prevented much misery.  I don't recall Moses forbidding alcohol...some verses of the bible speak against it, but most are indifferent.<br>
<br>
In any case, you make it sound like these were an instantly universal code of ethics instead of the admonitions of a priest class upon a minor collection of tribes in a remote portion of the world.  &quot;Spreading the word&quot; was never important to the Hebrews and still isn't today.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Some of those people will be brainwashed by a charismatic person that looks as if he knows what he is talking about.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
But that charismatic person might be guided by god!  Or the devil!  Or Buddha or Shiva or L. Ron Hubbard.  There's really no way to tell.  You might be guided by dark powers, too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Well, some religions dislike evolution, noticeably fundamentalist Christianity, but it's not like Darwin penned &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; as an attack on the church.<br>
<br>
It's all well and good to strive for &quot;enlightenment&quot; (whatever that is), but since no celestial shiny people show up to give you a pat on the back when you make a good move brainwise, it's impossible to say whether you've come a few bricks closer to the Emerald City of enlightened thinking or are 20,000 leagues from having a clue.  And even if shiny people did show up, they could just be devils out to trick you.  =)<br>

Of course they are. And the examples I gave come from one religious line or another. Not from all the lines. Thruth is still a matter of opinion in religion.<br>

<br>
I do not know if there is an Instant code of ethnics throughout the universe, I haven't talked to a figure of authority that can beyond any doubt proof me this. And Reproduction, along with relocation of your people following a single religion is also a way to &quot;spread the word&quot;. This is done by absorbtion of culture through the spreading community.<br>

If you judge religions on what their followers do, instead of what the religion itself states, it is comparable to judging the United States as an evil nation because we had slaves 200 years ago. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uluxum.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Luxum</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Evoker</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/02 11:52:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God and Religion (OT)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> but guess i just trust science more since thats whats going to get us to other solar systems and brought in the ways of life we have now(internet, electric power, cars, mass farming, etc). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Hmmm electric power, cars, mass farming...  all things which are extremely detrimental to the environment...  having blind faith in science has just as much potential for disaster as blind faith to outdated religious tenants.  Science is not infalliable by any means.

<br>
I would partially agree with you Eamin that it is really the people, not religion itself, that we must be afraid of. Unfortunately sometimes religion is used as a weapon.<br>
<br>
How the Crusades (for example) ever came out of twisted Christian doctrine I'll never know.<br>
<br>
I feel like if everybody actually understood and practiced what a religion (pretty much any religion) taught everything would be fine. It is when a religions words get twisted is when the trouble starts. That, and most people don't have a good enough understanding of what it is their repective religions actually teach. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/ustumpeyfyzzbang.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Stumpey Fyzzbang</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/17/02 2:12:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm4.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1133.topic&index=77>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.prodigy.net/cohmsford/america.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: God and Religion (OT)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It doesn't matter what you believe in, just that you believe.

And Fox, without getting into the specific example you gave, if God exists, how could He not have any business telling you what to do, no matter how much you disagreed?  If God is God, He has all the authority to tell us anything He wants. <p><font face=impact>
