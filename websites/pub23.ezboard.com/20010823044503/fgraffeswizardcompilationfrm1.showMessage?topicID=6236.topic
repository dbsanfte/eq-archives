My wife looted the warthread kilt off of Martar Icebear the other day. (The little greenie actually aggroed her in her late 40s for some reason, so she felt justified in getting a little payback for how he'd treated her first character, a barb warrior.)<br>
<br>
&quot;What the hell is this?&quot; She asked, after looting the Cloak of the Icebear.<br>
<br>
I figured, what the hell, and told her to hold onto it and that I'd like to multiquest it.<br>
<br>
First off, what does this thing look like when worn? Leather pants, yes? (Trying to keep my leather ensemble intact.)<br>
<br>
Second, any advice for getting a shadowed ball? I used the tips on the walkthrough to no avail. I'm now getting big wet kisses when I walk into the Temple of Solusek Ro (yummy faction hits), but I'd rather have the damn drop.<br>
<br>
Third, I'm not anticipating any problems whacking the shinta warrior at 45. Just sneak in and assassinate the little froggie. Realistic? Anything I should be aware of?<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/bgraffeswizardcompilation.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=british>British</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/14/01 4:43:57 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tishan's Kilt</span><hr size=1> &gt;Stop laughing!<br>

&gt;First off, what does this thing look like when worn? <br>
&gt;Leather pants, yes? (Trying to keep my leather <br>
&gt;ensemble intact.)<br>
<br>
I believe so, leather or something pretty close - I don't think it &quot;clashes&quot; with leather at any rate.  It's always under my robe so never really looked at it closely...<br>

I got mine in Lavastorm.  Took me at least an hour of nuking those stupid little shadow men, but it finally dropped.<br>

&gt;shinta warrior at 45. Just sneak in and assassinate the <br>

<br>
I attempted this solo, at 45, and very nearly died.  Even though he's green, I picked up a LOT of adds when I dropped invis and nuked (like about 6 or 7) and had a heck of a time getting them all rooted in that cramped little corridor.  I finally killed the warrior, looted the head and gated out with less than half a bubble of health remaining.  I'd bring along an enchanter friend for an AE mez just in case.<br>

<br>
As far as the shad men, the 2 places i have seen the ball drop are in the SK shad camp and the one in Lfay. Took hours both times before I saw them though, seems to be fairly rare, or it was when I was doing the quest.  Helping necros with quests and simply raising faction, I have hunted shad men in WC for some time through out and never seen one drop there though. There was a &quot;trick&quot; some one mentioned on a few sites of handing the Cleric shad men a weapon or a couple of weapons or even a twohanded weapon and it would make them drop the ball, but have many many attempts, it never worked for me or anyone I have known..<br>
<br>
hehe..i don't know if all that was a help or hinderance, but hope it helped somewhat...<br>

<br>
Anyway don't want to check right now but will.<br>
<br>
You find cleric shadow men and harmony them (so find a nice druid or someone who can cast harmony).  After they wont attack you on site go up to them and give them any 2 weapons, either rusty ones or looted shadow men ones.  This will remove the ball from their hands and somehow put it in their inventory.  Ok now kill the invisable cleric shadow man that originaly was holding a ball type thing on a stick that looked like a pop sickle.  Almost every time doing this will get a shadow ball to drop.   If a shadow ball for some odd reason dosen't drop loot the weapons you gave it and do it again.<br>
<br>
Don't know if this same tacktic works with other shadow men drop items but i dont think so. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#33333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub23.ezboard.com/uardius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ardius</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Forum Wizard</span><br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/14/01 10:33:10 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Tishan's Kilt</span><hr size=1> I still wear my kilt at 52, but then I am a STR freak.<br>

Soloing the shinta at 45 would in fact be fairly challenging, but I recommend that you get right to the very end of his hall, and you should get no adds other than the other 2 in that hall.   When I did it, I had a high 30s cleric with me, and I was high 30s.  The cleric vised first to get the agro on all 3, then I blasted the shinta, looted, and evac'd us both.    He didn't seem to be having any great trouble keeping himself alive even with 2-3 beating on him.<br>
<br>
The ball.... sigh.  I swear, really, not a word of a lie, I killed *AT LEAST* 2000 shadow men, over a span of probably 2 months, without seeing a single ball drop.  And yes, I tried the trick on the walkthru page here.  At least 4-500 times.  And NO it does NOT work.  At one point I had friends insisting that I should /bug it cause the drop was obviously broken.  I never did see one from my own kill.  One night myself and a friend were camping the WC ones, before going off to do something else... time came, we left, and asked a cleric who was camping there for something for a twink to keep an eye open, and we ported to NK.  No sooner did we land then the cleric sent a tell to my friend saying she had one.  We gated BACK!  FAST!  Got there in time.  Pure luck.<br>
<br>
Can't say I'd recommend actively trying to do this quest, but if you're bored and wandering past some shadowmen, wack em, just in case. :)<br>

<br>
1) The Shadowed Ball is VERY rare.<br>
2) Only the Cleric (ie Cone holding) Shadowed Men drop the ball.<br>
3) There are no tricks that work.  I tried them all.<br>
<br>
This has got to be the most sadistic Wizard quest in the game (next our epic, and possibly concussion).  I spent 4-6 hours a day, every day for 2 weeks killing shadowed men.  I tried SK, WC, LFay, and Lava.  I was finally successful in Innothule... and I was just passing through.  I saw some shadowed men, gakked all the cleric mobs, and one yeilded the ball.<br>
<br>
Pre-Velious, Tishan's kilt was the best pair of Wizard pants available (other than Carmine).  It's worth working on, just not to any extremes.  Whenever you log on, port around and kill all the shadowed men clerics.  Do this every day until you get yourself the ball, or some planar quality pants.  Don't waste as much time on it as I did.<br>
<br>
PS I got a second ball in LFay while wandering through.  Killed a cleric Shadowed man and he dropped the ball.  I ended up multiquesting it with a Wiz friend of mine.<br>
<br>
PPS No graphic on High Elves either.  Wait for Sages if you can =). <p><BR>

<br>
As for the Shinta frog, when I went there he wasn't up and a Shin warrior was in his place.  I'm amiable to Frogs, and the Shin dropped in one shot and nothin else aggroed.  15mins later the Shinta popped, dropped in an IC and I was off to get my kilt.  Hehe I only got this on the weeked by the way, and at 52 also.. *hangs head*.  Took me about 2 hrs doing the whole thing.  <br>
No graphic on High Elves for sure. <p><Font color=red>Eindyin Romenril<br>

But, for those of you that may be still after the Shadowed Ball (5AC, No Rent), the 'giveing of shadow wepons' works every time. I know - we tried it a lot last night while looking for my Patch of Shadow (I'm 5 points smarter now, Thankyou! )<br>
<br>
In wolf form (helps to have a druid, hehehe) give the snowcone holding shadowmen shadow weapons until the snowcone is no longer visible. <br>
<br>
Kill the shadow man. loot the body. The cone is there - guarenteed.<br>
<br>
This also works for the book of shadow (I think thats its name) for the Necro quest - Words of Darkness or somthing. The Necro shadowmen hold this book - give them weps and kill them, bingo! one book on the corpse.<br>
<br>
Works everytime. <p>Vermil Darkmire<BR>
